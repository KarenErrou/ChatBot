Other nonComanches they find are unsalvageable. Now The Searchers ends ambiguously. We're not sure what is going to happen with Natalie Wood's character. Two Rode Together goes into that part of the story a bit more. Stewart falls in love with the Mexican girl but she cannot take the way other white people treat her. The boy is so far gone that he is entirely violent to everyone around him. The second half of the film is actually quite great and the film has an extremely powerful climax. Jimmy Stewart is beyond excellent in the film. Could you ever imagine a bad performance from this man? It's rare that he plays such a cheating btard but he's no villain either. The actress who plays the Mexican girl is very good too. The rest of the cast is more than adequate. There's a funny scene where Ford regulars Andy Devine and Ken Curtis fight in a slapstick fashion. Ford's direction is rather flat. The story goes that he did this only as a favor not by any real choice. Frank Nugent's script is quite good especially in the second half. The score is excellent. The photography is weak but good sets and costumes make the visual aspect of the film decent if not great. 810.".

It's well documented that John Ford only did the film out of kindness and a love of money the great man going on record to say he hated the film the source and etc. The shoot was far from being a happy one with the director pitching his two stars against each other whilst grumpily putting his film crew through the mangler. The end result shows the film to be psychitzophrenic in tone and structure where airy comedy tries to sit alongside some serious themes and fails miserably. When the moral implications of the picture are to be born out Ford in his halfhearted approach to the production comes off as being either clueless sarcastically mean or going through the motions since he had already made this film as The Searchers. Well clueless is not something you can comfortably say in relation to this particular director....However film has strengths not least with Stewart's over the top portrayal of McCabe. The actor is really giving it the full treatment no doubt prompted by his director this is a shallow man motivated by ale and cash. This is non heroic stuff he calls it as he sees it he thinks nothing off telling the longing relatives of the missing that their loved ones are now alien to them. It's a clinical thread in the piece deftly setting the film up for its telling last quarter as the moral questions are raised and the bitter irony leaves its sour taste. It's a mixed bag indeed but hardly a disaster though and in spite of Ford's irreverence towards it there's a worthy viewpoint in amongst all the causticism. It's just a shame that all the great individual aspects don't make a complete and rewarding whole the blend of comedy and drama this time not making for a great John Ford picture. 6.510".

	schema:headline " Stewart and Widmark ride together";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film first in 1961 at the Riviera Theatre in Rochester New York with my cousins and I loved it. I found out later that John Ford in his cantankerous dotage dismissed all of the work he did after Wings of Eagles as junk.Well second rate John Ford is far better than first rate from 90 of directors. The film hasn't lost any charm for me even after 44 years.Army Lieutenant Richard Widmark takes a patrol into Tascosa to fetch Marshal James Stewart back to the fort where Commandant John McIntire has an assignment for Stewart. It's to negotiate with Comanche Chief Quannah Parker for the return of white captives taken during the Indian wars. The rest of the film is what happens to both our leads during that mission and after.To watch the chemistry between Stewart and Widmark is something to behold. There is a scene at the beginning of the film during the ride back to the fort where Stewart and Widmark sit on the bank of a stream while the horses are being watered. Ford has them engage in some bantering dialog where the characters are established. In the hands of these two consummate professional actors the scene almost takes on a sublime quality. It's my favorite scene in the film.As usual Ford rounds out his cast with a lot of his stock company. I have to single out Willis Bouchey. He plays Henry J. Wringle in this film who is along on this trip very reluctantly. He has the second best scene in the film with Stewart as he makes Stewart an offer that he'll pay him a thousand dollars to bring back any white captive around the age of his wife's son by her first husband. This is so he can get back to his business. Stewart's reactions to this offer are also something to behold. Willis Bouchey did so well in so many of Ford's later films but here and in The Horse Soldiers I think his career peaked.Second rate Ford is still good enough for me.".

I found out later that John Ford in his cantankerous dotage dismissed all of the work he did after Wings of Eagles as junk.Well second rate John Ford is far better than first rate from 90 of directors. The film hasn't lost any charm for me even after 44 years.Army Lieutenant Richard Widmark takes a patrol into Tascosa to fetch Marshal James Stewart back to the fort where Commandant John McIntire has an assignment for Stewart. It's to negotiate with Comanche Chief Quannah Parker for the return of white captives taken during the Indian wars. The rest of the film is what happens to both our leads during that mission and after.To watch the chemistry between Stewart and Widmark is something to behold. There is a scene at the beginning of the film during the ride back to the fort where Stewart and Widmark sit on the bank of a stream while the horses are being watered. Ford has them engage in some bantering dialog where the characters are established. In the hands of these two consummate professional actors the scene almost takes on a sublime quality. It's my favorite scene in the film.As usual Ford rounds out his cast with a lot of his stock company. I have to single out Willis Bouchey. He plays Henry J.

Good Western with James Stewart sort playing himself as corrupt and cynical marshal who takes a percentage on his works . Entertaining film thanks to James Stewart for his cynical character and ironic point of sight . Also Widmark is excellent  while a great featuredrole acting by veteran John McIntire . Solid support cast leads some eyecatching performances which include Andy Devine Jeanette Nolan John Qualen Ken Curtis  Woody Strode Henry Brandon as Quanah Parker and many others . Two rode together has a similar plot to The searchers though the Ford's vision about West is pretty cynical and less idealist. This classic picture ranks as one of the main of John Ford's works . It contains Ford's usual themes as familiar feeling  a little bit enjoyable humor friendship and sense of comradeship but also lots of cynicism . Thoughtprovoking screenplay portraying in depth characters and brooding events with interesting issues running beneath script surface is written by Frank S.

You'll find the final terrible or overmelodramatic according to your tastes  though it's lovingly composed by John Ford who really picks up the drama towards the ending .

	schema:headline " Leisurely John Ford Western doesn't have much action but the pleasant story makes up for it.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is not your typical John Ford Western.  The usual cast of Ford characters is on hand.  Henry Brandon reprises his role as the Comanche chief Scar which he played so well in the Searchers.  This time he plays a more sympathetic role as the real life Comanche chief Quanah Parker.  The evil Clegg clan from Wagonmaster is also on hand.  They are not quite as evil this time around.  The Comanches are played by the usual Navajos recruited for countless Ford Westerns. The awesome arid scenery of Monument Valley has been appropriately replaced by rolling grass covered plains country.The two protagonists in the film are played by James Stewart and Richard Widmark.  Stewart plays a gunfighter serving as sheriff of the Texas town of Tascosa.  Widmark is the cavalry officer who summons him to Fort Grant to rescue Comanche captives.  They ride together on this mission which is relegated to a small part in the plot.  Although they are friends their partnership is uneasy from the start.  Stewart is going on the mission for money.  Widmark is ordered by the colonel played by John McIntyre to go. The tension between the two leads at one point to Stewart drawing but not firing his gun.This film contains elements of The Searchers.  Like the other film the theme is captivity by the Indians.  Just as in The Searchers captivity is viewed as degrading.  Linda Cristal plays the captive in this film.  I am not worth fighting for she says.  Ford goes one step further here. Captivity by the Indians is depicted as extremely arduous.  The protagonists find few living captives to rescue.  The captives they do find are shown as prematurely old and savage.  Cristal is an exception.  Although she has been a wife to the Comanche chief Stone Calf for five years she retains something of her aristocratic Mexican upbringing.  Perhaps her strong Catholic faith enabled her to avoid the complete degradation typical of captives.  Like Debbie in The Searchers she has the prospect for redemption.  In The Searchers it is the strength of the family which provides redemption.  Here it is a stagecoach to a new life in California.The pace in this film differs from many Ford films.  There is only one action scene.  Much of the film is spent in quiet moments.  In the opening scene McCabe Stewart is relaxing on the porch of the saloon.  It is obvious that he has his law enforcement duties well in hand.  In another scene he and Lieutenant Gary Widmark are resting on the banks of a river. There is also a significant interlude as the wagon train camps at Oak Creek. There is also a dance at the fort.  At the end of the film McCabe returns to Tascosa to find someone else relaxing in his place.McCabe is an interesting character.  His ethics are questionable.  He owns 10 of everything in Tascosa he says.  He'll do almost anything for money. He makes it clear to the colonel that he figures that each captive he brings back is worth 500.  He then makes a deal with Henry J. Wringle played by Willis Bouchey to bring back a boy any boy for 1000.  Wringle wants to get on with his business and can't afford to waste more time looking for his wife's son.  McCabe is more than happy to oblige him bringing back a boy whose savagery is unquestioned.In the end there is redemption for both Stewart and Cristal.  Both of their characters are interesting and well acted.  It is a pity that so many other characters in this movie are wasted.  Woody Strode's part as Stone Calf is particularly disappointing.  The script gives him very little to say and do. He is around only long enough to go against Stewart in the film's only action sequence.  Andy Devine provides much of the film's humor but is not really credible as what McCabe calls that hippopotamus of a sergeant.I wish the film had spent more time focusing on Stewart and Widmark's mission to the Comanche camp as the film's title suggests.  Unfortunately it's only a footnote.  Despite the flaws the leisurely pace and Stewart's portrayal of the amoral McCabe make this film a treat.".

It's fascinating  and weird  and compelling. SPOILERS  The movie has such mixed feelings about those who hope to find family members who've been captured by Commanchee Indians. At times it's deeply sympathetic  showing their pain particularly Shirley Jones playing that music box. At other times the movie finds those who hold such forlorn hopes must be bizarre in our very first sight of the mother of the missing son we are meant to believe that she's not mentally sound on the issue. At other times there's cynicism about them e.g. the man who says any captive will do  he has to get back to his business or those who are disgusted at the returned male former captive being so Indian.The movie is schizophrenic in showing on the one hand the utterly unsentimental Stewart as he calmly kills the Indian whose wife he's just captured and saying shut up to his keening wife yet showing him deeply disturbed by the mere fact that the cavalrymen won't dance with her.The movie is schizophrenic in the way it shows the bar owner Belle whom we're meant to think is a sort of comic manhungry woman through most of the movie  but who then issues the harshest racist comment backed up by a dagger at the end. HUH?The movie is schizophrenic in the way it shows one captive on his return acting like a wild animal who knows only how to kill whites  yet the movie wants us to think there is no such danger whatever and we're to be outraged at the mere thought from the other captive on her return. If we're meant to believe that one former captive would kill whites at the drop of a hat why wouldn't she? Because she's a woman? Not according to the way Belle is shown at the end.The movie is schizophrenic in the way it treats Richard Widmark's character  he completely shares Stewart's astonished fear that any discussion could take place regarding matrimony  yet we see no change of heart when he ups and proposes to Shirley Jones.The movie is schizophrenic in the way it regards John McIntyre's character  are we to think he shares the bigotry of the others at the dance when he demands an apology from Widmark? Or are we to think he's the only decent man at the post?The movie is schizophrenic in the way it regards the former female captive  given how swiftly she accommodated herself to life as a squaw after her husband was killed  and then immediately wants Stewart the moment her Indian husband was killed  and her repeated statements that she regards herself as dirt and not worth anyone fighting over  are we to think there is something deeply wrong with her? That she cannot live without a man for a single day  and will take anyone who'll have her? The movie is schizophrenic in the importance it gives to Shirley Jones' character  at times she seems to be one of the central characters  yet at the end when we see Stewart and Widmark and Cristal together  WHERE IS SHE? What are we to think of the lynching scene? I was sure that someone was going to stop the lynching  but no! And there are no consequences. SPOILERS END  I kept thinking as I watched that this must be a political allegory of some kind  like The Crucible or High Noon  but I can't think of any kind of politics that it would resemble. At times I thought of the civil rights movement going on at the time  but that doesn't at all fit with the movie's view of Commanchees as abominable.This movie is truly bizarre  from Andy Devine bouncing people into the lake with his stomach to raw accounts of rape. You have to see this to believe it  yet so many wonderful scenes  including the famous and absolutely winning and delightful one of Widmark and Stewart sitting on that tree log by the lake or river.".

	schema:headline " like a darkcomic sequel to the Searchers less about the search than those brought home";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure why John Ford had such a problem with Two Rode Together as he did according to the trivia page Ford considered the film crap even after his favorite writer came in to make it more like a Ford picture. It brings many of his favorite or just preferred themes to come back to male camaraderie the very fragile divide between whites and Indians in the late 19th century and a sense of balance between leisure pace and high dramatic tension and stakes. Maybe he thought he was repeating himself or had other ideas that didn't make the final cut of the script or lost them in the direction. There's a lot of meat on the bones of Two Rode Together even if if it does shy away from real greatness. It takes its story seriously and also leaves some time for some unexpected human comedy between its two leads or just mostly James Stewart.It's premise is a little like a reworking or quasisequel to the Searchers. In that film Wayne was on a dogged search for his niece after she'd been captured by the Comanches and spends years tracking them down only to find her totally changed he still brings her home anyway. In Two Rode Together a Marshall about as tough and gruff and cruelly sarcastic as Wayne in that film and a Major Richard Widmark the more levelheaded and honorable of the two if not quite as interesting are put to task by the army to go to Comanche territory and bring back a few people that had been taken away years ago. Their families are desperate to see them again and the Marshall is way more reluctant than the Major as he's had more experience with the Comanches that and the lack of pay very shrewd and greedy he is. But they go ahead to the Comanche territory track down a couple of them and bring them back. This is halfway through the movie.The rest of Two Rode Together sees the dire straits of this assimilation how one of them a rowdy boy who doesn't speak a lick of English isn't even thought to be the right son of the desperate mother and the other a Mexican is pushed aside and made to feel an outcast right away. How Ford and his writer presents this isn't very insightful I'm sure other films have explored the AmericanComanche relationship with more depth or subtlety but it's still entertaining and full of some compelling scenes.

	onyx:emotionText "I'm not sure why John Ford had such a problem with Two Rode Together as he did according to the trivia page Ford considered the film crap even after his favorite writer came in to make it more like a Ford picture. It brings many of his favorite or just preferred themes to come back to male camaraderie the very fragile divide between whites and Indians in the late 19th century and a sense of balance between leisure pace and high dramatic tension and stakes. Maybe he thought he was repeating himself or had other ideas that didn't make the final cut of the script or lost them in the direction. There's a lot of meat on the bones of Two Rode Together even if if it does shy away from real greatness. It takes its story seriously and also leaves some time for some unexpected human comedy between its two leads or just mostly James Stewart.It's premise is a little like a reworking or quasisequel to the Searchers. In that film Wayne was on a dogged search for his niece after she'd been captured by the Comanches and spends years tracking them down only to find her totally changed he still brings her home anyway. In Two Rode Together a Marshall about as tough and gruff and cruelly sarcastic as Wayne in that film and a Major Richard Widmark the more levelheaded and honorable of the two if not quite as interesting are put to task by the army to go to Comanche territory and bring back a few people that had been taken away years ago. Their families are desperate to see them again and the Marshall is way more reluctant than the Major as he's had more experience with the Comanches that and the lack of pay very shrewd and greedy he is. But they go ahead to the Comanche territory track down a couple of them and bring them back. This is halfway through the movie.The rest of Two Rode Together sees the dire straits of this assimilation how one of them a rowdy boy who doesn't speak a lick of English isn't even thought to be the right son of the desperate mother and the other a Mexican is pushed aside and made to feel an outcast right away. How Ford and his writer presents this isn't very insightful I'm sure other films have explored the AmericanComanche relationship with more depth or subtlety but it's still entertaining and full of some compelling scenes. And while Ford keeps the drama moving at a nice clip sometimes leisurely sometimes with more force like at the dance later in the film he lets his two stars do a lot of lifting that makes the movie very worthwhile.Stewart has been this cranky before but rarely have I found this kind of grumpy but moral Marhsall so wellrounded.

	schema:reviewBody "Marshal Guthrie McCabe had a cushy life in western town getting a hundred dollars a month plus ten percent of the town's business that is until his old friend 1st Lt. Jim Gary of the United States Army rides into town 'requesting' that he accompany him to a Fort forty miles away to undertake an unspecified task. When he gets there he learns that they want him to go into Comanche territory to bargain for the return of white prisoners who were captured many years before many of whom were young children at the time. Guthrie says that it is a fool's errand any child will have grown up to live as a Comanche a will have forgotten their old life. The people are desperate though and eventually he agrees if the price is right. Once in the Comanche camp he and Jim talk to the chief and he agrees to take one unwilling boy and a woman Elena back. He does not take an old woman who asked to be left and another young girl who had had children there knowing their families will not welcome them back when they see how they have changed. Elena is a Mexican who had only been with then for five years and was married to a hotheaded brave. Once back at the camp things do not go well the people treat Elena with contempt and things go even worse for the boy. There is also a romantic subplot involving Jim and Marty a girl who is hoping to find her lost brother.I hadn't heard of this film until I saw it advertised but seeing as it stared the usually reliable James Stewart I thought I'd give it a go. I am glad that I did as it was pretty good not as good as 'The Searcher' which covers similar themes but still worth watching. James Stewart was good and surprisingly amusing as Marshal McCabe and Richard Widmark put in a solid performance as Jim Gary. The story was pretty decent and it was a relief that the Comanches weren't depicted as being any worse than the 'civilised' white people back at camp although it was unfortunate that native actors weren't used I know that is how things were done back then but it still seems a bit off. Coming from director John Ford I'd expected stunning vistas but the settings weren't that spectacular the film still looked good enough in the countryside where it was set. Overall I'd say this wasn't a must see film but if you like westerns or the films of Jim Stewart it is certainly worth watching.".

That's a good thoughtful premise but the screenplay can't seem to provide a focus on anything. As a result the story meanders from event to event in generally unfocused fashion. For whatever reason writer Nugent can't seem to organize the elements into a coherent effective narrative.Then there's the miscasting especially Widmark as a 45year old West Point lieutenant who's supposed to romance a 26year old Shirley Jones who looks and acts like she just stepped out of a malt shop. And shouldn't forget poor 55year old Andy Devine a very uncavalrylike cavalry sergeant. Somehow his grossly overweight figure is just not that funny. On the other hand Stewart's not miscast but this may be the only movie where his usual lowkey style gives way to some serious overacting which unfortunately overshadows his lowkey costar Widmark. His character is however surprisingly dark and combative an interesting feature.At the same time for a western there's little action mostly just palaver and clumsy stabs at humor. However the lynching scene is well staged and a real grabber. Anyway it's pretty clear that director Ford's heart wasn't really in the production for whatever reason. Unfortunately the end result is one of the least of his many fine Westerns.".

	schema:headline " Fordv Recycles old Material!";
	schema:reviewBody "Two Rode Together is considered by many to be one of John Ford's lesser westerns including Ford himself. It's basically a vehicle for the film's two stars James Stewart and Richard Widmark.The basic plot has army lieutenant Jim Gary tricking town marshal Guthrie that's right McCabe Stewart into returning with him to his fort where he is cajoled into embarking on a search for white captives of the Commanches in order to return them to their families who are waiting nearby as part of a wagon train. Gary and McCabe then proceed into the camp of Commanche chief Quanah Parker Henry Brandon. They return with two captives Elena de la Madriaga Linda Cristal the wife of Commanche rebel Stone Calf Woody Strode and a teenage warrior Running Wolf David Kent. Tragic events follow.Ford borrows ideas from many of his previous westerns. The opening scene for example shows Stewart sitting back in his chair with his feet up on the railing much like Henry Fonda in My Darling Clementine 1946. The whole premise of Two Rode Together is the search for white captives not unlike the plot of The Searchers 1956 even to the extent of casting Henry Brandon in much the same role he played in the earlier film. The Cleggs Ford Rainey Harry Carey Jr. Ken Curtis are similar to the point of using the same surname as characters in Wagonmaster 1950. There is even a commanding officer's ball much like that in Fort Apache 1948.The film is light on action....hardly a shot is fired. Except for individual clashes there are no major incidents between the cavalry and the Indians. There is but one fistfight and that is played for laughs.There are however some memorable moments in this film as there are in every John Ford picture. One involves a lengthy scene on a riverbank between Stewart and Widmark where they trade humorous remarks. The meeting in the Indian camp of the captive mother of the Clegg boys played by silent star Mae Marsh is very moving. The plea of John Qualen for the return of his daughter is also very touching.As in most Ford westerns there is a large cast.

	onyx:emotionText "Two Rode Together is considered by many to be one of John Ford's lesser westerns including Ford himself. It's basically a vehicle for the film's two stars James Stewart and Richard Widmark.The basic plot has army lieutenant Jim Gary tricking town marshal Guthrie that's right McCabe Stewart into returning with him to his fort where he is cajoled into embarking on a search for white captives of the Commanches in order to return them to their families who are waiting nearby as part of a wagon train. Gary and McCabe then proceed into the camp of Commanche chief Quanah Parker Henry Brandon. They return with two captives Elena de la Madriaga Linda Cristal the wife of Commanche rebel Stone Calf Woody Strode and a teenage warrior Running Wolf David Kent. Tragic events follow.Ford borrows ideas from many of his previous westerns. The opening scene for example shows Stewart sitting back in his chair with his feet up on the railing much like Henry Fonda in My Darling Clementine 1946. The whole premise of Two Rode Together is the search for white captives not unlike the plot of The Searchers 1956 even to the extent of casting Henry Brandon in much the same role he played in the earlier film. The Cleggs Ford Rainey Harry Carey Jr. Ken Curtis are similar to the point of using the same surname as characters in Wagonmaster 1950. There is even a commanding officer's ball much like that in Fort Apache 1948.The film is light on action....hardly a shot is fired. Except for individual clashes there are no major incidents between the cavalry and the Indians. There is but one fistfight and that is played for laughs.There are however some memorable moments in this film as there are in every John Ford picture. One involves a lengthy scene on a riverbank between Stewart and Widmark where they trade humorous remarks. The meeting in the Indian camp of the captive mother of the Clegg boys played by silent star Mae Marsh is very moving. The plea of John Qualen for the return of his daughter is also very touching.As in most Ford westerns there is a large cast. The female lead is a miscast Shirley Jones complete with braided pig tails who is seeking her captured brother the husbandwife team of John McIntire as the crusty Major Frazer and Jeanette Nolan as a slightly mad Mrs. McCandles Andy Devine along for comedy relief as Sgt. Posy and Willis Bouchey as Mr. Wringle who tries to buy his son any son's return. Also in the cast are Ford Regulars Anna Lee and Jack Pennick and look for a very young Ted Knight as Lt.

Two men make a long journey to visit a Comanche camp and bring back white captives.The cast features names like Carey Carey Jr. Roberson Hayward Whitehead Curtis Lee Devine Bouchey Brandon Qualen Pennick and Strode. It not only suggests John Ford but it suggests The Searchers in particular.It's not The Searchers though it's Two Rode Together with James Stewart and Richard Widmark in the leads and Shirley Jones and Linda Crystal as their ladies fair.The first half hour or so is entirely successful as a comic Western. Stewart is a cheerfully corrupt marshal in Tascosa Texas and Widmark is a captain in the US Cavalry. The film really depends on Stewart's portrayal of an utter scoundrel and he delivers. He flatly turns down the Army's request to visit the Comanche camp for humane reasons but on his way to the door the major asks if money would make any difference. Stewart turns thoughtfully around. Waall ye  yes. Yeah money would make a difference. One of the best scenes has Stewart and Widmark sitting on a log next to a wide and shallow stream. Ford had the camerman and crew set up in icy waters up to their knees to get this long and unvarying shot of the two having a casually hilarious conversation.There are amusing moments later in the film as well as Stewart tries to suggest ways that Linda Crystal can stop looking like an Indian and get all gussied up for the dance that night. Lamentably Stewart knows nothing about women's fashions. Why don't you  you  try  wait a minute. And he takes Crystal's two long thick pigtails and twists them this way and that around her face and head while she stares up at him pitifully.When Ford gets serious the movie falls apart a pale shadow of The Searchers. Confronted by a barechested Woody Strode  a Comanche!  who has come to reclaim his wife knife in hand Stewart whips out a pistol and shoots him to death where he stands. Linda Crystal is at least a docile recaptured captive. The other one they bring back  a seventeenyearold boy  is not only ugly but must be listed among the world's worst actors. Not that he has much to do but kick and scream but then many of the actors is small parts overact.When it's funny it's funny. And when it's sad it's REALLY sad.".

	schema:reviewBody "Enjoying just one more of a steady stream of easy days in his small town Marshal Gutherie McCabe is visited by US 1st Lt Jim Gary an old friend. Gary has orders to bring McCabe back to his base for an unknown assignment. Arriving back at the base McCabe is asked to go into Indian territory so that he might barter for the children now adults who were captured by the Comanche many years ago. Despite the chances of actually collecting recognisable or even civilised adults from these children McCabe accepts the job in return for considerable financial recompense. Gary is assigned to accompany him but both men are aware that their mission is only one that will fuel the despair that many already feel.The only things I knew about this film when I sat to watch this film were that it was a western starred James Stewart and had been pretty much dismissed it as one he made as a favour for the boss of Columbia Pictures. With this final fact in mind I wasn't too hopeful for the film to really be much cop. True to my expectations the film was average at best but it started out better than this and offered interesting material at the same time. The film opened with such a relaxed bonhomie that it was a surprise 25 minutes in to see it become more and more edgy dark and mean. This change in tone comes in with the hurt and anger felt by the townsfolk who hope for something that can never be the return of their children in a way this offers potential because the plot cuts both ways and offers a lot of raw emotion if the script can harness it. Sadly the film never really gets to grips with any of this potential and produces a fairly bland and uninvolving story with emotions too simply spelt out in characters that are mainly too basic. The only character that I really felt was semirealistic was Gutherie who drifts between his good side and more mercenary character outside of him nothing was done well enough to cover the many problems.The cast are also part of this potential but few of them really manage to do anything with what little they are given. Stewart does well to turn his usual character into something a bit darker and gives an interesting performance. Widmark is always watchable but he doesn't fit into the story well enough for me. Of the support cast most are poor or average. Cristal and Jones are painted too clean and don't give good performances while Kent goes too far the other way with a poor 'savage' performance. However my biggest 'sighs' were saved for the Ford staple comic relief character  in this case Posey who is written with a lack of humour and originally that is only matched by Devine's performance.Overall this film opened with a nice comic tone that became darker and had me interested due to the change and the potential for the story. However the simple characters basic emotions and uninspiring acting all combine to miss the mark and produce a rather average western albeit one whose dark tone and subject matter causes it to have some aspects that are interesting and thoughtprovoking.".

This is in part due to the story that Ford only made the movie for money and later made disparaging remarks about the film. Assuming this is true consider two things one artists aren't always the best judges of their own work and two Ford was always a cantankerous old cuss who blew a lot of smoke at the media. I thought this was a very very good movie although it is not without serious flaws. Here are some positives Two great performances by James Stewart and Richard Widmark who play frenemies. The extended comedic banter between the two reminded me of the interplay between John Wayne and Kirk Douglas in The War Wagon. There something comforting about watching two old pros at the top of their game. The famous extended two shot by the riverbank deserves its reputation. The comic relief in the movie is so pronounced that at times during the first half you start to wonder if it isn't an outright comedy. Andy Devine does the heavy lifting but with solid contributions from Stewart Widmark and the other supporting cast members. Stewart's character Guthrie McCabe is well drawn. He's a stereotyped super scout on the one hand but a cynical greedy drunk on the other. The romantic lead Shirley Jones is a fully developed character not just a gratuitous babe. She has a haunted past due to her guilt over her kidnapped brother and the plot resolves her conflict. I love John Ford because he rarely neglects my three favorite Western themes of Civil War Mexican and Indian references. Nice extra touch here having a nonstereotyped Mexican character Elena de la Madriaga who is an aristocrat turned Indian captive. Always nice to see the familiar members of the Ford troupe including Harry Carey Jr. and his mother Ken Curtis and others. One of my favorite supporting actors John McEntire also puts in an appearance. Setting of the story moves nicely from place to place. Relatively little violence with only one death by gunshot and a pretty horrific lynching.There are a number of negative aspects to this movie that kept it from being better The first third of the movie is great as the characters of Gery and McCabe are introduced and they travel together to Fort Grant. It begins to go downhill when they reach the fort and it is revealed that the movie will be about the retrieval of white captives from the Commanches. It makes the movie feel like a retread of The Searchers especially since it seems like half the cast of that movie is in this one. Things get worse when they reach the Commanche camp when we discover Henry Brandon virtually reprising his role of Scar in The Searchers. If that's not bad enough the plot becomes infested with holes and implausibilities which I expect in an Anthony Mann movie not a John Ford movie. I've listed a few of them at the end of the review. As it concludes it degenerates into an uninspired and preachyCivil Rights Western complete with an actual lynching. There are serious age differences in the romantic interests. Widmark's 45 years old and Shirley Jone's character is barely out of high school. I'm not sure Stewart's girl Elena is that much older but at least she's been broken in by Stone Calf. Disappointing location shooting. I don't recall seeing so many sound stage scenes in a Ford Western. And when they go on location little effort is made to have panoramic Western backdrops. Lack of a well defined prominent heavy hurts the movie dramatically. Woody Strode's Stone Calf is under characterized. Plot holes Why don't they bring back the old woman and the young girl hostages from the Commanche camp? The father said he didn't mind if she had Indian children. I know she doesn't want to go but neither did the teenage boy and they took him. Why does McCabe stay behind to confront Stone Calf? Why doesn't Stone Calf bring some warriors with him to retrieve his wife? We were told that Stone Calf believes that magic protects him from bullets but couldn't he have made a more credible charge into into McCabe's camp? His wife grieves for Stone Calf's death enough to conduct an Indian burial ceremony but two days later wants to marry the guy who killed him. I could go on.......".

Plot holes Why don't they bring back the old woman and the young girl hostages from the Commanche camp? The father said he didn't mind if she had Indian children. I know she doesn't want to go but neither did the teenage boy and they took him. Why does McCabe stay behind to confront Stone Calf? Why doesn't Stone Calf bring some warriors with him to retrieve his wife? We were told that Stone Calf believes that magic protects him from bullets but couldn't he have made a more credible charge into into McCabe's camp? His wife grieves for Stone Calf's death enough to conduct an Indian burial ceremony but two days later wants to marry the guy who killed him. I could go on.......";

	schema:headline " Curiously LightHearted for a Film with a Supposedly Serious Theme";
	schema:reviewBody "In Two Rode Together John Ford returns to the theme he had earlier dealt with in The Searchers that of white people raised or held captive by the Indians. In The Unforgiven from the previous year Ford's rival John Huston had dealt with the opposite theme that of an Indian girl strangely played by a miscast Audrey Hepburn raised as white by her adoptive family. The two of the film's title are Marshal Guthrie McCabe and his friend Lieutenant Jim Gary who are tasked by Gary's superior Major Fraser with the job of ransoming any white captives being held by the Comanche. Because Fraser is coming under pressure from relatives of the captives the two are authorised to use any means to achieve this end including offering modern rifles to the Comanche in exchange even though it is normally taken for granted in Westerns that the greatest reason any white man can commit is to sell weapons to the Indians.Ford's normal favourite actor John Wayne does not appear in this film the leading roles are taken by James Stewart and Richard Widmark. In the early part of his career Stewart was not an actor particularly associated with Westerns Destry Rides Again being an exception but in the fifties he got a taste for the genre and made a number of fine ones with director Anthony Mann. He fell out with Mann after the latter withdrew from Night Passage but this did not affect his love for the Western and he found a new collaborator in Ford. They did not it would appear get on particularly well on the set of Two Rode Together but nevertheless went on to make three move films together including The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and Cheyenne Autumn.One weakness that occasionally crept into Ford's movies was a tendency to introduce some inappropriate humour into an otherwise serious film. That was even true of films as good as The Searchers and Cheyenne Autumn and it is certainly true here. The film is based around some serious themes such as ethnic identity racism and the relationship between Native Americans and white settlers. It purports to examine the bigotry shown by many whites towards both the Indians themselves and any whites felt to be tainted by association with them. Those captives whom McCabe and Gary eventually rescue are not made welcome by their own people. It includes some violent incidents such as a woman being stabbed to death and a teenage boy being lynched by a mob. Yet the tone is at times curiously lighthearted especially in its depiction of the relationship between McCabe and Gary.The main culprit is Stewart who had done some great work with Mann but here seems far too laidback. McCabe is far from being a spotless hero when we first meet him he is acting as the business partner of a saloon owner which here is a polite euphemism for brothel keeper and living off a percentage of her immoral earnings. His motives for accepting Fraser's commission are mostly mercenary ones. Now in his collaborations with Mann Stewart who in the earlier part of his career had generally played cleancut Mr Nice Guy characters created some memorably flawed heroes such as Howard Kemp in The Naked Spur but seems unable to do the same here. Ford was not particularly satisfied with Two Rode Together he believed that he had treated the same theme far better in The Searchers. He was dead right there. This is not perhaps the worst Ford film that must be that horribly overrated sentimental piece of Irish blarney The Quiet Man. It is however the worst Ford Western I have seen and probably the worst Stewart Western as well. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "Germany just before the Wall that was to physically divide East and West for nearly 3 decades. Thousands are fleeing the East German system to the West. Particularly young people who feel oppressed and stifled by the Communist way of life are tempted to start over in the West.  The young cinema idol Hardy Kruger plays the East German dreamer who first helps a girl escape to the West then falls in love with and marries her. His ultimate dream is to buy the run down bar where he had secretly been moonlighting for some time. Although his employer is ready to retire and sympathetic to the young couple this lofty dream seems difficult enough to realize if not unreachable.  There are several memorable scenes in this beautiful piece of Historical Cinema but the repeated marriage proposal stands out. Kruger recalls repeatedly what his grandfather used to tell him The Devil always craps on the biggest pile. That may be true but so is this saying The best things in life are free.  This film is a romantic look back at a time in German History where a nation emerged from the rubble of WWII but hard work for modest gains in comfort and status would stretch for many years. The Wirtschaftswunder didn't come overnight and neither did middle class comforts. These are definitely the struggling years but for young couples who had each other they were still the best years of their lives.".

	schema:reviewBody "The most important thing to remember when watching Two of a Kind is that is was really a vehicle for the two stars based upon the idea that their chemistry in Grease would make for another hit which sadly in this case it didn't. They were determined to do another film together and had looked through over 30 scripts before choosing this one  one wonders quite how dire some of those must have been...Other reviewers have already written about the plot so I won't concentrate on that rather on the performances and the way the film comes across.There is a pretty starry cast here  Gene Hackman plays God Oliver Reed plays the Devil and angels include Charles Durning and Beatrice Straight. Unfortunately as a film experience it just doesn't seem to work  probably the reason why it did so poorly at the Box Office at the time despite a 5m marketing budget.  Lots of rewinding and stopping time which can be confusing if you're not paying attention Oliver Reed singingbadly and minor characters Olivia's flatmates her landlord that do nothing for the plot and tend to irritate when they appear.However Olivia and John do make a very cute couple  I spent the entire second half of the film with a grin on my face feeling very soppy once they get it together.The acting on the part of the two stars is fine. If I'm nitpicking ONJ gives a slightly uneven performance in TOAK  one or two scenes where she seems to be saying the words with a bit too much acting but very commendable otherwise.  They both have a good sense of timing and that comes though. There is even a love scene although hardly xrated  they keep most of their clothes on although ONJ reported that she felt quite nervous about it at the time. She even swears in one scene which is a bit weird the first time you hear it!I always felt sorry that ONJ had a poor run with films after Grease and pretty much chucked the acting in bar the occasional TV movie although she seems to be making a slow return in a few indie films in the last 5 years. I think she could of gone on to a decent film career if she'd have picked some better films in the early 80's. She does have a good sense of comic timing she is known in entertainment circles for a wicked sense of humour  maybe in an alternate universe could have been the Meg Ryan of her generation...The soundtrack is probably the strongest thing about TOAK  ONJ sings about half of what you hear in the film she is head and shoulders above everything else.  Olivia and John even do a duet  Take a Chance although it's not really anything to write home about.  Give me Twist of Fate anyday.I am a fan of both Olivia and John and I do love this movie.  However I appreciate its faults and I'm not going to pretend that it's something it isn't.  All in all it's not a great movie in the traditional sense of the word.  Where you are going to get rewarded watching TOAK is if you are a fan of Olivia andor John especially the two of them together.  It is a romantic comedy and not a particularly good one at that but that chemistry between them is certainly still there after Grease and that does give TOAK a certain something.".

NewtonJohn is the bored bank teller who takes pity on his predicament teaming up as they dodge enemies and the law. Amid all the chaos God has decided that the world is no longer worth the effort and plans to bring about its end. Only the intervention of a trio of well meaning angels and Travolta and NewtonJohn as the saviours can change God's mind. Encapsulating the unusual plot in a few sentences almost makes it sound complicated not to mention absurd but in reality it's very light and entertaining.Diverse cast in the supporting ranks Reed Durning Crothers Straight and Hudson most notable provide madcap characterisations and Travolta and NewtonJohn have an onscreen chemistry that is warming if hopelessly corny at times. The soundtrack featuring some minor hits from Chicago Journey and Boz Scaggs as well as NewtonJohn is easy listening and fits the lighthearted mood well. There's some reasonable action sequences stunts and setwork and enough entertaining moments to fill out the 85odd minutes.An honest invention not the typical selfindulgent romantic comedy that became stock standard of the nineties.

	schema:reviewBody "With a cast this good it's natural to expect a lot more than this script could deliver. John and Olivia are reunited for the first time since Grease and the results were a big letdown for a great many people.Our story centers around the fact that God played by the voice of Gene Hackman is fed up with humanity. He's so tired of all the crime and bad behavior on Earth that he plans on sending another huge flood to finish us all off. Four angels who are perhaps the best part about the film plead with God to give humanity one more chance. God agrees but demands to see some kind of miracle within a week or so. Apparently it will only take a couple of mere mortals Travolta and NewtonJohn sacrificing something for each other to save all of man kind. Too bad both characters are selfcentered and shady. Travolta is a struggling inventor! who owes a fortune to a violent loan shark. NewtonJohn is a struggling actress who also works at a bank that Travolta plans to rob for the money to pay off his debt. Olivia tricks him and takes the money for herself setting up contrivance after contrivance for the remaining screen time. It looks like the world will come to an end since neither character trusts the other why should they? and the Devil is also on the scene to foul things up for them. I could go on and on about this plot but you probably get the idea. This is pretty questionable material we're working with in terms of a screenplay.I liked Oliver Reed quite a bit as the Devil. If the Devil walked the streets of New York I suppose that's how he'd look or act. I also enjoyed watching he and the Charles Durning's angelic character square off by moving time back and forth to suit their respective needs. The film gets a few laughs out of a restaurant scene where the two demolish the place before God appears to reign in Durning for abusing his powers.The film is full of 80's clichs and scenes that only serve to date the material. There is little or no chemistry between the two leads and that was the main reason behind this film's failure. Travolta's body is bound to be a plus for the ladies in the audience. He was still buff from his work in Staying Alive. Olivia looked better in Xanadu with her longer hair if I may be so bold. The film did virtually nil at the box office and Travolta's career went south in a hurry shortly thereafter.I'll give it 4 stars mostly for the great cast. And any film with Scatman Crothers always gets a bonus star from the Hound. I loved that guy.5 of 10 stars total.".

I'm sure it was a refreshing change for ONJ from the peasant dress she wore in Xanadu.  The plot is incidental but an added reason to see this film is the wonderful presence of the late actors Scatman Crothers Oliver Reed and Beatrice Straight a dramatic actor who inexplicably made this one of her only comedic roles.  Reed is a pleasure to watch and Crothers is as jovial here as he was playing Kick the Can in Twilight Zone The Movie. They should have realized what they had and made it more campy but hey as long as we're in on the joke.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the type of movie pseudosophisticated snobs who write sprawling reviews including a play by play of the movie they are supposed to be criticizing instead of describing drool over. They harangue us about how predictable it all is how it fails to re capture the magic of grease so on and so forth etc. They lament how It's a simple vehicle much like a Chuck Norris or Charles Bronson vehicle except this one uses the Grease duo...newsflash...SO WHAT? The primary purpose of film and art is to entertain if you can entertain and make a statement at the same time more power to you but it is not a requirement. Two of a kind has no statement to make..neither did Bringing up Baby but I don't here these twits lining up to bash it. That much said 2 of a kind is not on the same level as that film but it is still a good movie. Travolta and John have a natural chemistry that makes you believe they really do care about one another and more importantly are attractive enough in a bare bones way for the audience to care about. Oliver reed steels the show and beats out Bill Cosby the devil and max devlin Ray Walston Damn Yankees and George Burns Oh God You Devil with regards to Luciferian Comic relief and Charles Durning is one of the few character actors who seemed capable of transitioning effortlessly from villain to dare I say? Angel. With Regards to this movie under performing at the box office it should be pointed out that only 2 movies released wide in the Christmas season of 83 did well Sudden Impact and Uncommon valor..and most of the top 10 films where released in the springsummer season. Yentl and Silkwood where not released wide but competed with this one and due primarily to undeserved critical acclaim ran twice as long making only slightly more money than this one. The executives at 20th century fox went crazy with the promotion budget and threw a temper tantrum yanking it after only six weeks because it didn't live up to their unrealistic expectations. The snob critics played their part in cutting it down in it's prime.if only Box office mojo was around in the 80's maybe the critics and execs would have been put in their rightful placesI saw 2 of a kind as a kid on HBO and ..I remembered very little of it..which is odd but I remembered liking it. The Curiosity led me to rent it on netflix. Having just watched it...I still like it. The dining room scene is creative screwball perfection and the song Twist of Fate is 80's bliss. Two of a kind will not change your life...but as much as many film critics might hate it...many of us average folk like our lives and enjoy simple formula films tastefully done using talented actors in movies that don't attempt to unravel the mysteries of the universe. You might not remember much about it after you see it but my guess is just like I did as a 9 or 10 year old once you do you will remember enjoying it because all heavy handed aesthetic challenges aside it is an enjoyable movie. And more importantly it has the added novelty of allowing you to enjoy it again and again".

The devil is also on hand in the form of the big ham himself Oliver Reed. The movie is one entertaining fantasy best when not analyzed and scrutinized apart. The characters are mildly onedimensional the plot superficially illogical and the pace uneven. The magic isn't there as it was in their other movie but I only watch this movie for Olivia anyway. Travolta may have become a Hollywoodminded Scientologist but he does have some charm in this as a downandout inventor who becomes a fumbling bank robber.

	schema:reviewBody "There is only word one that fully does justice to this film APPALLING.John and Olivia were BETRAYED! WHY they would choose this moviesomeone else on here said they looked through over 30 scripts before settling on this oneand why they would let this firsttime director decimate their careers in this way it's inexplicable. WHY anyone at any studio would take these two huge stars though Olivia had been tarnished by Xanadu by this time and TOSS THEIR CAREERS TO THE WIND on this turkey is again inexplicable. Why does this film exist? The answer lies I think in Olivia's 'rebranding' effort trying to shift out of being wholesome and pure and be a bit of a vamp which in retrospect seems like a big mistake look what happened to Sheena Easton when she tried the same thing and look at the continuing debacle that is Britney. Everyone loves Olivia being pure and a bit cheeky. Look how adorable she was in Grease! It is just so incongruous for her to be a bankrobbing shiftless liar that it is impossible to get involved with her character. Okay that sounds like there is even one 'character' in this film but you know what I mean.There are several compelling issues raised by this film such asWhy does John Travolta walk like he has a broomstick etc. but ALL the way in the whole movie? Did his mother tell him his posture was bad or something?Were general production values REALLY that low back in 1982? No wonder films are so expensive now.WHO was the director related to that he was allowed to make this?WHY when Olivia's face is presented in the paper in a loving 6' X 8' picture identifying her as a wanted bank robber does she just walk around and attend her acting class as though nothing happened? Why does no one in her acting class mention it? Why don't the police show even the SLIGHTEST interest in apprehending her and recovering the money? Why doesn't anyone she the slightest interest?WHY do songs on the soundtrack blare inappropriately and completely without context throughout?There are a few notable moments that must be pointed outPlease take note of the first shot of John Travolta in those stupendously ridiculous glasses. And it's only getting betterTwo words 'I'm Single.'Please note how someone offscreen obviously CHUCKS the live cat at the pots in the kitchen! This would not be allowed these days! Though you will obviously note that 'ethnic diversity' is being DEPLOYED in the group of angels though it doesn't seem to prevent them from making the black man a bus driver!Please admire the architectural splendor of Olivia's hair and her multitude of 80's fashion debacles including the green ensemble with big gold pirate belt and turneddown suede boots as they're walking down the street soon before sampling the edible sunglasses. Note that John is drinking Red and Olivia is drinking White obviously because the producers thought this would appear 'sophisticated.'Of course there's the 'Twist of Fate' montage where Olivia gets to sport the appalling sunglasses. Olivia's songs here definitely lack the John Farrar touch who had composed all of her hits heretofore and it's obvious where the problem lies.Alas what more can be said? Oh I know it was only on second viewing that I noticed that John and Olivia actually DIED a third of the way through the film because John fell on Olivia from a great height naturally but were brought back to life by the angels to continue the film. Now isn't it kind of sad that a filmANY filmcan be so poorly directed that the main characters can DIE and you don't even notice?Now if you don't want to watch it after reading this I don't know what's wrong with you.

It is a what if premise and we follow the young beautiful couple as they try to make some fast bucks while they avoid the two bad eggs. Olivia in the acting class is a nice laugh. John does some good physical moves. I worked this as an extra at Burbank Studios. I was in the scene near the end where John had to jump onto a car roof and climb a fire escape. He actually did that bit. That is not a stunt performer. We hear some of Olivia and even some of John singing but they don't really get into any musical scene. That would have been nice. Scatman and Charles Durning and Oliver Reed are very good in this. The casting was fine.".

He actually did that bit. That is not a stunt performer. We hear some of Olivia and even some of John singing but they don't really get into any musical scene. That would have been nice. Scatman and Charles Durning and Oliver Reed are very good in this. The casting was fine.";

The film wastes a great selection of co stars no more than Reed. But back to the atrocious acting where Razzie nominations were definitely deserved much more so with Olivia Newton John who like Travolta was so good in Grease. She doesn't speak as a character. She speaks like herself overreacting over acting where at times she's so unbelievably unconvincing she's a joke. And here's the irony. Her character is a struggling actressbank tellerand later you guessed it actre.... waitress who inhibits more unconvincing acting abilities well not as unconvincing just hammy which is rather entertainingly amusing better than trying to watch her act out her character. She gets caught up with pathetic bank robber Travolta the type who can't keep a moustache on and doesn't check his winnings that haven't been placed in his paper bag. Reed plays God where his disciples address on an important matter. God is sick of so much wrong doing and is beyond comprehension or a twisted notion that no one is capable of one decent act. He wants to end all life where his disciples must prove him wrong. And this where Olivia with her radiant beauty and charm plays a girl called Debbie and John with his cool sexy looks plays a guy called Zach come into the picture. The arrest scenes are so clichd has no surprises although when hearing the start of Twist Of Fate I felt a montage coming on and yes would you believe it I was right! There's a lot of fast forwarding rewinding fast forwarding rewinding a touch annoying and I'm being overly sarcastic where freeze framing is at an adequate number. Olivia is half annoying as this as the earlier mentioned really gave me he s..ts. John was much more easier to bare. The scenes in Heaven are well done and very creative and overall the film is very entertaining on it's first view thanks to the laughing expense towards it's leads where Olivia does make it very funny. But we can't get over the fact it's a pathetic entertainingly bad flick 80's double cheese where Travolta hair style was in. The film has a tragic end then surprise. And then Twist Of Fate replays over the end credits a welcome burst of relief. Here's a film I won't view again for a long time or may'be never. Travolta just has another turkey to add to his resume as we can see this star was fading fast soon after this until being resurrected in 94 by QT. But for acting honors the two mains here ought to be shot.".

We have seen John perform seriously in Urban Cowboy Pulp Fiction or The General's Daughter. And his comedic through Welcome Back Kotter.

The story of film is kinda lame but who knows what God might have up his sleeve. It would be interesting to find out that he is just like Gene Hackman. And to find out that he liked Shakespeare. LOL.

It's a great opposites attract film and it works for me. The fact that each of the central characters has a vocational passion makes them all the more attracted to each other despite their callings being separated by a lot of geography and a lot of psychological differences.

Seeing her in her prime again is delightful. I was also impressed at how well it holds up over time. It's a shame it was critically panned and did poorly at the BO when it came out bc in a decade full of strange movies this is a standout and now IMHO a classic. And the best part? Being reminded that the Bald Eagle population in the early 80s was only 2000 in North America and now it's in the six figures. The mountain lion scene is a little farfetched but goodness that is a gorgeous cat.".

	schema:headline " It ain't Bluto Jake or SNL!";
	schema:reviewBody "Continental Divide is by far John Belushi's greatest performance. Most people are quick to disagree usually for one reason and that is because they didn't find it believable. His audience was so accustomed to his characters 'Bluto' from Animal House and 'Jake' from The Blues Brothers on the big screen and his usually wild and loud skits on SNL that they couldn't accept him as playing the lead in a romantic comedy. They couldn't and wouldn't accept this new role for him. For Belushi it was his chance to break out of his stereotype and tackle a role that he felt would prove that he was more than just a skit on SNL. In my opinion he did just that. Although this is not one of the greatest movies ever made it certainly isn't as bad as some have claimed it to be. There are some dull moments but for the most part Belushi comes off as a very likable and convincible guy. Belushi fans waited impatiently for him to get off a good oneliner or to blow mashed potatoes all over the place but when that never happens they write it off as a bad movie and an even worse performance by John. I like to point this out Let's pretend that this is Belushi's first movie forget Bluto Jake Blues or any character he ever did on SNL. With all of that in mind watch the movie. John will surprise you by how well he plays his character. If this was in fact the first movie Belushi ever did it would of gotten way better reviews and press and would have been more accepted by his audience since they wouldn't have been expecting him to pull a Bluto stunt or break out into somersaults a la Jake Blues. The only thing that disturbs me in this movie is that his character makes several remarks about dying very soon. In 1981 it probably wasn't even given a second thought but unfortunately as we all know now Belushi died very soon after this movie was released. Had John not died so soon and so young I think he would still be making movies today unlike so many of his other SNL costars who seemed to have faded away into the woodwork. To make a long story short Forget about Bluto Jake and SNL and just watch the movie you should really enjoy it.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Belushi's screen persona is fixed in most peoples minds thanks to his performances in the raucous knockabout comedies 'The Blues Brothers' and 'Animal House'. But here he gets the rare chance to put in a performance of exceptional depth and nuance. Belushi plays hardboiled investigative journalist Ernie Souchak who finds himself a little too close to some major City Hall corruption and so on the advice of his editor and friend he heads to the mountains of Colorado to chill and to write a piece on a reclusive conservationist played to exquisite perfection by Blair Brown.The film begins as a serious piece on political corruption but soon turns into a charming bittersweet 'fishoutofwater' romance. The scenes set amongst the Colorado mountains feature some of the most breathtaking cinematography I've ever seen. The movie belongs to John Belushi though. He puts in a splendid mature performance dominating the action like a major presence. It is through this movie rather than his more famous works that I feel we now sense the feeling of loss that his tragic early death gave the world of cinema. He carries all the weight and clout of a genuinely gifted actor and his comic timing even in the smallest scenes is a joy to behold. Blair Brown too is another enigma. Why is she not much more famous than she is? Her performance is both tough and sexy and she and Belushi make a great screen partnership. Throw into the mix one of the rare screen appearances from the great Tony Ganios and this really is a movie worthy of rediscovery.Watch for it.".

That's one of the things I loved most about Continental Divide it was like a big middle finger to the inane and contrived clichs which plague modernday romantic comedies.Continental Divide is one of my favourite man and woman alone in the wilderness type movies in this screwball comedy for the 1980's which at the time advertised Belushi and Brown as the next Hepburn  Tracy. With the likes of His Girl Friday and Libeled Lady Continental Divide has the underlying theme that longterm romantic relationships and careers in journalism are an apparent impossibility only the typewriters are out in favour of computers. Although I do have to ask how many journalists have the levels of a celebrity among the populace as Ernie Souchak has in which he is constantly recognised in the street. Likewise Ernie Souchak's employment of the Chicago SunTimes is the paper film critic Rodger Ebert writes for although there is no cameo or mention of him in the film likely due to a conflict of interest.Nell Porter is a woman so reclusive she lives in the mountains while attending to her study of Eagles. She has a desire for peace and quiet and I get the impression she is disenfranchised with civilisation partly due to her dislike of the media. Having a female character like this is one of the reasons I'm so attracted to a love story like this since weird girls are my thing. Plus speaking of the wilderness does this movie look good! Filmed atop of actual mountains in Montana and Washington State It just shows you that Planet Earth is the greatest movie set of all.It is evident from both Continental Divide and his final film Neighbours that John Belushi was trying to escape typecasting. Continental Divide proves he had what it takes to be a romantic leading man however his time left on this world was short at this point but the legend lives on.".

	schema:headline " This is not a comedy it's a dramaromance with amusing touches";
	schema:reviewBody "RELEASED IN 1981 and directed by Michael Apted Continental Divide stars John Belushi as Ernie Souchak a popular Chicago columnist whose controversial reporting compels his boss to send him to the scenic Rocky Mountains to interview a bald eagle researcher Nell Porter Blair Brown. Souchak is a city man who chainsmokes whereas Nell revels in the wilderness and hates journalists. Do ya think a relationship will blossom?This is not a typical John Belushi comedy but rather a romantic drama with some amusing touches. Continental Divide is one of John's only serious roles and he does it well. It's also one of his last films less than six months after its release John passed away from drug abuse at the tooyoung age of 33 on March 5 1982.I'm not a fan of romcoms but I will occasional watch them if they're unconventional enough and Continental Divide fits that description. There are a few minor laughs usually tied to Souchak's awkwardness in the wilderness but that's about it. Although lighthearted this is indeed a serious film. It's not only entertaining it surprisingly has a few notable things to say.The most prominent part of the film is the hour or so where Souchak goes to the Rockies and stays with Nell. Most men will likely become infatuated with Blair Brown as Souchak falls in love with Nell. I did. Blair was 35 years old at the time of filming and has a very earthy look she never wears makeup and never reveals a lot of flesh. She doesn't need to. She has a strong independent mindset and yet at the same time is winsome and alluring. Her body has the necessary natural roundishness and curves that attract redblooded men.I heard some reviewers complain about the mountain man part played by studly Tony Ganios. They argue that this is a meaningless and unneeded sequence. Actually the story is making a statement with this subplot. See my commentary below if interested. The first two times I saw Continental Divide I felt it was dubiously named. Much of the story takes place in the mountains near the Continental Divide so what? The third time I watched it the title's meaning dawned on me aduh Souchak and Nell's lives are divided by half a continent how could a longterm relationship possibly work? The ending is surprising and unconventional but it works.THE FILM RUNS 1 hour 43 minutes and was shot in Chicago Colorado Washington and Los Angeles. WRITER Lawrence Kasdan observe how the kisshiswounds scene is reminiscent of the similar scene in Kasdan's Raiders of the Lost Ark which was released a few months earlier.GRADE BSPOILER ALERT Don't read further until you view the movie.Although Nell would occasionally meet the macho stud as a sexual outlet in the lonely wilderness it's obvious she doesn't love the dude in a romantic sense. Their relationship is superficial because it fulfills only one purpose and doesn't go any deeper. As the story progresses Nell falls in love with Souchak a man who is the antithesis of the studly mountain man in every way. Souchak isn't macholooking at all he's only of average height if that and isn't in very good physical shape. He is however an intelligent and expert writer amongst other things. The message we can glean from this is that men don't have to be ultramasculinelooking to win the heart of a beautiful woman. And you know what? It's true. Just look around. This is an encouraging message for guys who aren't the tall dark and handsome type.".

There are a few minor laughs usually tied to Souchak's awkwardness in the wilderness but that's about it. Although lighthearted this is indeed a serious film. It's not only entertaining it surprisingly has a few notable things to say.The most prominent part of the film is the hour or so where Souchak goes to the Rockies and stays with Nell. Most men will likely become infatuated with Blair Brown as Souchak falls in love with Nell. I did. Blair was 35 years old at the time of filming and has a very earthy look she never wears makeup and never reveals a lot of flesh. She doesn't need to. She has a strong independent mindset and yet at the same time is winsome and alluring. Her body has the necessary natural roundishness and curves that attract redblooded men.I heard some reviewers complain about the mountain man part played by studly Tony Ganios. They argue that this is a meaningless and unneeded sequence. Actually the story is making a statement with this subplot. See my commentary below if interested. The first two times I saw Continental Divide I felt it was dubiously named. Much of the story takes place in the mountains near the Continental Divide so what? The third time I watched it the title's meaning dawned on me aduh Souchak and Nell's lives are divided by half a continent how could a longterm relationship possibly work? The ending is surprising and unconventional but it works.THE FILM RUNS 1 hour 43 minutes and was shot in Chicago Colorado Washington and Los Angeles. WRITER Lawrence Kasdan observe how the kisshiswounds scene is reminiscent of the similar scene in Kasdan's Raiders of the Lost Ark which was released a few months earlier.GRADE BSPOILER ALERT Don't read further until you view the movie.Although Nell would occasionally meet the macho stud as a sexual outlet in the lonely wilderness it's obvious she doesn't love the dude in a romantic sense. Their relationship is superficial because it fulfills only one purpose and doesn't go any deeper. As the story progresses Nell falls in love with Souchak a man who is the antithesis of the studly mountain man in every way. Souchak isn't macholooking at all he's only of average height if that and isn't in very good physical shape. He is however an intelligent and expert writer amongst other things. The message we can glean from this is that men don't have to be ultramasculinelooking to win the heart of a beautiful woman. And you know what? It's true. Just look around. This is an encouraging message for guys who aren't the tall dark and handsome type.";

OK that is it with the negative lets start with positive. This is an underrated gem of a romantic comedy. There is roughly a laugh out loud line or sight gag every minute of the film. To compare that is about 108 more laughs than My big fat Greek wedding and the wedding crashers combined Belushi is mostly terrific. He never played the same part twice anyway in his short career and he is great as the hard nosed newspaper man who falls completely forand you cannot blame him Blair Brown as a passionate animal activist. You know i have spent 25 years looking for a woman like this.............. When God when?Great Great movie.".

You can totally see him prepping for those same goofy dad or romantic loser roles. You have to give a lot of the credit to his costar Blair Brown who is very warm and believable throughout. I thought the script was a bit too cutesy and failed to have the zing of the Spencer TracyKatherine Hepburn films its shadowing but its still impressive as a story because the characters have chemistry. We spend most of the film with just two characters but they don't become tiring. The film has the magic and sweetness you expect from Spielberg but its not as visually interesting as it would be if he directed.

	schema:reviewBody "Predictable and clichd as it may be Continental Divide isn't a bad film. The performances are sincere the mood upbeat and the characters easy enough to root for. The story deals with a streetwise Chicago reporter having to get out of town for a while after incurring the wrath of a corrupt local politician. Is there any other kind in the Windy City? Anyway his editor and the editor's wife think he should write a story about a mysterious female ornithologist living in the mountains of Wyoming. Apparently she has lived all alone for 4 years and has become the world's foremost expert on bald eagles. Predictably the reporter is skeptical of this assignment but of course in the very next scene we see him stumbling up the side of a mountain cursing the entire way. Naturally when the reporter and scientist meet it isn't love at first sight. They bicker about this and that between shots of nature and occasional animal attacks. The reporter is sexually attracted to the woman but it takes a while for her to dump her mountain man lover and warm to her new guest.In some ways this plot reminded me of Crocodile Dundee which I've seen recently. Only this time the reporter mostly stays in the wilderness and HE is the fish out of water. This film clearly marked a turning point in Belushi's brief career. Here he was definitely trying to tone things down from his demeanor in previous films and he pretty much pulls it off. He could have played just about any role had he lived long enough to do so. He does however look about a decade older than he actually was when this was made. The years of drug abuse were taking their tole. Blair Brown is fetching energetic and someone who could have had a bigger career. She is believable as the birdlover though the interior of her cabin is too LL Beanish compared to the rugged exterior we see in outdoor shots. Indoor and outdoor scenes were likely filmed in different locations. And the film uses the scenic Empire Builder route of Amtrack as the setting for a marathon lovemaking session by our two leads. Very romantic indeed.This film has some glaring lapses in logic as many romantic comedies do. Do you really think that street muggers would recognize even the most famous of city beat reporters on sight as they rob him for his watch and wallet? How about prostitutes? These don't seem like the types that read newspapers too often. How often do hunters actually shoot at bald eagles? Not much if ever. Despite their reputations among city folk most hunters have a great love and respect for nature and would never take a shot at an endangered symbol of our country. It does set up a scene with an interesting payoff though. 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

Unfortunately neither is very well adapted to life outside of New York and they end up framed for a crime.I hadn't seen Stir Crazy since at least the early 1980s. Recently I had a chance to rewatch Gene Wilder's The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother 1975 which I hadn't seen since the 1970s and I was a bit disappointed. So I was nervous that Stir Crazy might also be a let down this far removed in time. That couldn't have been more wrong. I may have even thought it was funnier and more exciting this time around than when I first watched the film as a teen.I had forgotten that Stir Crazy isn't just a comedy. It's also fairly suspenseful and surprisingly serious at times in the last act. Director Sidney Poitier makes a smooth transition through many genresbuddy film road movie fish out of water story and prison film aided of course by Wilder and Pryor. While both actors have had plenty of performances just as good as Stir Crazy neither have had any that were better.In a way this is really more Wilder's film than Pryor's. That's no slight on Pryor Wilder just ends up getting more screen time. He presents a hilariously bizarre complex character who is full of contradictionskind of a channeling of a less loquacious Woody Allen through a more down to earth version of his Willy Wonka Willy Wonka  The Chocolate Factory 1971. Wilder's Skip Donahue has an air of Mister Rogersstyled goodnatured innocence with the same kind of odd and maybe creepy homoerotic overtones but he'll also turn on a dime into a neurotic screaming loon. As I said it's all very complex but extremely funny and enjoyable to watch.Pryor's Harry Monroe is more of a streetwise perpetual victim who doesn't adjust to the social world of the criminal justice system as well as Donahue does. He has a much more typical reaction with no misconceptions about their dire circumstances.The crux of the humor in the first section of the film is the naivety of Donahue's grass is always greener on the other side conception of the Western U.S. compared to New York City. Of course things turn out to be not quite so simple but it's funny and charming that Poitier and writer Bruce Jay Friedman have Donahue never quite wake up from his nave misconception. It also turns out to have much more weight than just a comic device Donahue survives in prison as well as he does and it brings about the profound changes of characterDonahue becomes much more authentic realizes his potential gains material for his art and even gets the girlbecause of his continued misprision in the Bloom sense about life outside of New York City and in the end it enables a return to the market as they say in Zen Buddhism.Watching Stir Crazy at this later point in time some of the humor might seem a bit clichd to younger viewers. It's important to remember that this is where a lot of those clichs came from. In 1980 everyone was mimicking scenes from this film such We bad . . . and repeating dialogue and jokes. Some of the filmic and by extension general cultural folklore or urban legends about prisons contained in Stir Crazy had made appearances in films prior to this one but not in the particular irreverent way that they're satirized here.This is an important film in the careers of a few of the greatest actors and comedians Wilder Pryor and Poitier with an important place in the history of Hollywood comedy. The fact that it's also suspenseful and has philosophical things to say about human nature is a bonus that makes this a film you shouldn't miss.".

He was a graduate of MIT an accomplished opera singer an Olympic wrestler devoted husband and father writer etc. The poor man died at the age of 34.It also was interesting to see such a young looking Craig T Nelson and JoBeth Williams.This might have been the best of the WilderPryor films.

I was about 3 or 4 and my grandfather rented the video back in the early 80s this was INCREDIBLY sophisticated. Even though it's pretty much an adult film with swearing nudity and adult themes I found it to be hilarious at such a young age and I watched it few times. Over the years I've watched it more and more and I only just got round to buying the DVD a few days ago. And now at 26 the film is still just as funny as it always was. There is not a single unfunny moment from the beginning to the end even though the last act gets serious and suspenseful.Gene Wilder and the late Richard Pryor play Skip Donahue and Harry Munro two NYC losers who are making no money in their dream jobs of playwrite and actor. Stuck with insulting service jobs they both get fired on the same day at the same moment for various reasons. Skip the apparent ladies man and ever the delusional optimist talks Harry into seeing it as their big chance to escape NYC and head for LA 'where you smile and they just POUR money on you'.In their rusted derelict combi they make it as far as Glenboro a hicksville backwater desert town where they are promptly framed for bank robbery. Their lawyer is utterly useless and they are in jail before they know it literally. Skip only realizes the seriousness of the situation as they are being shown into their cell. But when Skip shows he has undiscovered talents as a rodeo champ the crooked Warden forces him to compete in the annual rodeo competition giving Skip Harry and some others a chance to escape.The chemistry between Wilder and Pryor is insane. Skip is innocent optimistic romantic and sees the good in everything. Harry is cynical and reactionary and is frequently the real victim of Skip's impossibly goodnatured personality. Everything they say and do is brilliant and every scene has something special about it that you'll remember always. It's literally impossible for me to pick out one in particular as they are all as great as each other.It's hard to believe that auteur actor Sidney Poiter directed this movie. I've never really seen in do a crazy comedic performance so for him to be so ontheball and humorous behind the camera is always a surprise when watching Stir Crazy.There's so many things that Stir Crazy has going for it. It's not just a crazy comedy it's also a character drama with wonderfully surreal and authentic moments massmassmass murderer Grossberger sining 'Down in the Valley' and proving to be as timid as a kitten being one of them.If you don't find Stir Crazy funny you're dead. And if you've never seen it...you're certainly no movie buff.".

I just watched it again on Netflix Streaming and the answer is yes! I mean from the set up beginning sequences with Richard Pryor as a waiter and Gene Wilder as a store detective there's plenty of funny stuff here. By the time they get to prison Pryor and Wilder try lots of crazy stuff that still got me in stitches especially when Richard's character has to deal with a gay inmate named Rory Schultebrand Georg Standford Brown who has a fancy for him. Fellow inmates Gene and Richard befriend include Jusus Ramirez Miguel Angel Suavez and Grossberger Erland Van Lidth De Jeude. The latter doesn't talk but he does provide a nice singing voice that compliments Gene's in a later duet. Others they meet in the cell include Blade Charles Weldon Big Mean Cedrick Hardman his sidekickSlowpoke Grand L. Bush and a guy who punches the former Tony Burton. Outside of the jail are many nowfamiliar faces like Joel Brooks as lawyer Len Garber JoBeth Williams as cousin Meredith her future Poltergeist costar Craig T. Nelson as deputy Ward Wilson and Barry Corbin as warden Walter Beatty who has the distinction of appearing in two 1980 movies featuring the mechanical bull the other being Urban Cowboy. Since this is Black History Month I'd like to complete this review by citing three more AfricanAmerican players other than Pryor Brown Weldon Hardman Bush and Burton Franklyn Ajayewho previously appeared with Pryor in Car Washas a young man in hospital ward that accidentally got a nut cut off Esther Sutherland as the cook Sissie in the beginning sequence and Pamela PoitierSidney's daughteras the cook's helper. So on that note I highly recommend Stir Crazy. Oh and I also noticed Luis Avalosthe guy named Chico who uses pliers for sinister purposesfrom my childhood TV show The Electric Company from the '70s.".

Nelson as deputy Ward Wilson and Barry Corbin as warden Walter Beatty who has the distinction of appearing in two 1980 movies featuring the mechanical bull the other being Urban Cowboy. Since this is Black History Month I'd like to complete this review by citing three more AfricanAmerican players other than Pryor Brown Weldon Hardman Bush and Burton Franklyn Ajayewho previously appeared with Pryor in Car Washas a young man in hospital ward that accidentally got a nut cut off Esther Sutherland as the cook Sissie in the beginning sequence and Pamela PoitierSidney's daughteras the cook's helper. So on that note I highly recommend Stir Crazy. Oh and I also noticed Luis Avalosthe guy named Chico who uses pliers for sinister purposesfrom my childhood TV show The Electric Company from the '70s.";

	schema:reviewBody "Stir Crazy is directed by Sidney Poitier and written by Bruce Jay Friedman. It stars Gene Wilder Richard Pryor Miguel Angel Suarez Georg Stanford Brown JoBeth Williams and Erland Van Lidth. Plot has Pryor and Wilder as two care free New York buddies who after getting fired from their jobs decide to make their way to Hollywood in search of better fortunes. However after taking up a gig as promotional woodpeckers for a bank's advertisement drive they find themselves framed for robbing the bank and sentenced to 125 years each in prison..The second pairing of Wilder and Pryor proves to be the best of their output on film. With their chemistry skin tight film is full of laughs until a big slow down for the last third when the inevitable attempt at a prison break out occurs. Poitier's direction isn't up to anything other than correctly letting his two lead stars strut their stuff. But along with writer Friedman he has to be accountable for letting the comedy dry up as the film chooses tension over humour which undoubtedly doesn't sit at all right. Still the first hour is a joy ride particularly once the guys land in prison here the comedy reaches its peak and the contrast of the two characters played by Wilder and Pryor really mines the setup for all is worth. Wilder is oblivious to the hazards of prison life Pryor is street savvy and fully aware of the perils around every brick walled corner.Naturally there's a hope on the horizon which here comes in the form of Rodeo skills this too brings the laughs as does the number of prison characters that join in the plot. Notably Van Lidth's monstrous and monstrously funny Grossberger. Yes it's a roll call of prison stereotypes from the top where the morally dubious Warden Barry Corbin sits down to the cons where gays bullies and gate happy loonies reside. With that some of it now seems twee and badly out of date. So much so it's a film that is unlikely to garner a new and appreciative audience. However those who were enamoured and found themselves laughing heartily with it back in the early 80s should find that like myself it holds up real well. Kind of like an old friend you call on when you need a pick me up. Hardly a superior comedy classic then but a film that rewards its fans on each subsequent revisit. 710".

They stop over in a town in Arizona get a job as dancing woodpeckers who do jingles for a bank and then are arrested when two other men steal their costumes and rob said bank.They then are sent to jail for 125 years by the nononsense judge and the film documents their attempt to get used to prison life pray that their lawyers can prove their innocence and hope Skip Gene's character can dominate the prison rodeo.As I said there's nothing deep or thought provoking in this film. It's just the zany antics of the two comedic legends. Some strong acting by the cast and excitement are in the offing and the film delivers that in spades.What was neat to see were all the T.V. stars of past and future in the supporting cast like Luis Avalos of The Electric Company and Craig T. Nelson of Coach. It was fun to recognize all these old faces.The only flaw was that the film's writing seemed geared for an easy job of editing for T.V. I wonder if just making it PG would have been better for their box office numbers. Nonetheless Stir Crazy was the 3rd highest grossing film of 1980.If you're looking for a real comedy film a blast from the past Stir Crazy delivers.".

	schema:reviewBody "After their successful partnership in Silver Streak comic duo Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder reteamed for this wacky prison comedy under the direction of Sidney Poitier. Originally intended as a film entitled Prison Rodeo the film eventually got released under the title Stir Crazy  complete with a catchy title tune sung by Wilder himself  and was a big hit for its two stars. In truth it is considerably short of the brilliant standard set by Silver Streak.... while that film was witty charming and exciting this one is very broad with lots of outright silliness. But having said that Stir Crazy is still totally enjoyable in its harmless way.New Yorkers Skip Donahue Wilder and Harry Monroe Pryor decide to head out west dreaming of a new start away from the Big Apple. En route they stop off in various small towns and take on parttime jobs to fund their trip. In a town called Glenborough Skip and Harry are hired by a bank manager to dress up in woodpecker costumes and entertain the waiting customers with a songanddance act. However a couple of rednecks steal their costumes and rob the bank while Skip and Harry are on their lunch break.... when the unsuspecting pair return to work they are promptly arrested for the robbery they didn't even commit. It isn't long before the innocent duo are locked up in the penitentiary with a 135year sentence hanging over them! Skip impresses the prison warden by riding a bucking bronco mechanical bull at full speed and is later approached to represent the prison in a forthcoming annual rodeo show. The rodeo provides Skip and Harry plus a few of their new convict pals with a chance to attempt an audacious prison break....Stir Crazy is more entertaining during the opening twothirds than the final third. The comedy aspects seem to run out of steam and the last half hour is dedicated purely to the jail break sequence. While the escape is tolerable enough to watch it isn't really in keeping with the zany tone established earlier in the movie. Wilder and Pryor are good together despite their well documented onset differences.... it was around this time that Pryor was getting out of control with drugs the supporting actors have amusing moments along the way too especially Erlind Van Lidith as a mass murderer who develops an unlikely affection towards Harry and Skip. The film is quite episodic in some ways especially during the middle section when the prison guards try various nasty strategies to intimidate Skip into joining the rodeo team. The funniest moments are the more spontaneous bits where Wilder and Pryor's chemistry is thrust to the fore the scene where they get bad upon first entering a jail is a wonderful example of this. All in all Stir Crazy has much to enjoy but just runs out of gas on its final lap.".

Wilder's nice guy is a perfect match for Pryor's wisecracking. This film has a fine supporting cast as well George Stanford Brown although his portrayal of a gay inmate may not seem politically correct today he is hilariously swishy though! Jobeth Williams Barry Corbin as the corrupt wardenand Craig T. Nelson before he became a Coach. Sidney Poitier does a wonderful job of directing these two comedy legends I might add. The prison escape in the end kept me on the edge of my seat. I liked Skip and Harry so much that I was just rooting for them all the way! Pryor was burned shortly after this film was completed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stir Crazy starts in New York City as best friends Skip Donahue Gene Wilder  Harry Monroe Richard Pryor are both fired from their jobs on the same afternoon drowning their sorrows in a local bar Skip tells Harry that he is fed up with New York  convinces his friend that they should set off on a road trip across the US to Hollywood to find their fame  fortune. Harry agrees but their old van breaks down in a small town called Glenboro needing money to pay for the repairs Skip  Harry are hired by a bank to sing a song dressed as Woodpeckers. Two local crooks steal the Woodpecker costumes  rob the bank for which Skip  Harry are blamed they go before a judge found guilty  sentenced to one hundred  twenty five years each behind bars in state prison. Both Skip  Harry are unprepared for the harsh reality of prison  decide to use the upcoming rodeo to escape...Directed by Sidney Poitier this is the sort of film that you will get  roll around on the floor laughing or find crude  unfunny comedy like so much else is subjective  what makes one person laugh will not necessarily make the guy sitting next to him laugh so when I say that I thought Stir Crazy was often quite hilarious it's only my own personal opinion as I know quite rightly the person I was standing next to in the que at the bus stop may not. Simple. I won't say that you will find Stir Crazy as funny as I did but I think you would need to be pretty devoid of emotion not to find at least some of it amusing  as I said I think it's often outright hilarious. The film starts off almost entirely as a showcase for the comedic pairing of Wilder  Pryor with some terrific scenes including the Woodpecker dance the 'I'm bad' scene in jail some priceless oneliners  reactions to the general likability of the two leads as they turn the material into gold. However once the rodeo aspect  jail break angle kicks in during the second half of the film the comedy seems to take a back seat as gambling cheating  an odd jail break why did Harry have to go back into the rodeo? Why couldn't Rory  Jesus climb up the shaft  into the popcorn thing like Harry  Skip do? take center stage. Also the ending is a little silly  unsatisfying in it's attempt to finish as quickly as possible sure Harry  Skip have been acquitted but that still leaves the fact they broke out of jail  helped two other convicted criminals including a murderer to escape too. While I am poking holes in the plot would a lawyer's niece really get a job in a topless bar just on the off chance she might see a guy with a particular tattoo? Now that's going above  beyond the call of duty unless of course she needed the extra money as well.Shot in a real Arizona prison this has good production values  is well made for what it is although there's no real action apart from some rodeo footage of horses  bulls thrashing around. While there is plenty of bad language  profanity there's no violence to speak of. Apparently Richard Pryor refused to wear the Woodpecker suit while filming but strangely did wear for the poster  promotional materials.Apparently a big success at the time even though the critics generally hated it some of the country  western style music  songs are a little nerve grating  distracting but nothing too major. The acting is good Wilder  Pryor in particular are brilliant here as a pairing  it's said a lot of scenes were improvised between the two. Even though their character's never meet in Stir Crazy both JoBeth Williams  Craig T. Nelson went on to star in the excellent Poltergeist 1982 a couple of years later.Stir Crazy is a film that I found extremely funny Wilder  Pryor are on top form  while the logistic's of the story seem to have been shoved to one side Stir Crazy is just a film to be enjoyed  not taken too seriously.".

When the unfortunate situation described above happens they wind up in prison. The naive Skip Wilder an aspiring playwright takes notes and Harry Pryor facing the reality of the situation is terrified. In prison they meet the very gay Rory Georg Stanford Brown the sweet Jesus Miguel Angel Suarez who misses his girlfriend Teresa the huge scary Grossberger Erland van Lidth de Jeude who turns out to be a pussycat with a beautiful singing voice the miserable guard Craig T. Nelson and the warden Barry Corbin. When it's discovered that Skip has a natural ability to ride a mechanical bull the warden enters him in a rodeo where he has a huge bet with another warden Nicholas Coaster. Harry Skip Rory Grossberger and Jesus plan an escape to take place at the rodeo.Very funny film with one of the highlights being Pryor in the prison hospital because he was told he had to have his appendix out though they had already been removed. Skip is advised that in order to get the team he wants at the rodeo he needs to turn down the warden's request that he ride. Putting Hank in the hospital is just one ploy to break him down. The scene is hilarious.Pryor and Wilder work beautifully together the street smart black and the naive dreamer. There's always something so sweet about Wilder and nervous about Pryor one walking into obvious danger while the other one desperately tries to pull him out that just worked in all their films. It's also a rare chance to see the uniquely talented Erland van Lidth de Jeude a huge 6'6 Dutch heldentenor who qualified for the Olympics in wrestling was a teacher an MIT graduate and had his own computer company. An absolutely amazing man who died 7 years after this film.Lots of fun. Recommended.".

It is a sad sad shame that he deteriorated in health with the onset of MS culminating in his tragic passing yesterday December 10th 2005. Stir Crazy was the 2nd greatest movie of 1980 in my opinion true movie buffs will know which was the greatest of that year.

I've been looking for a copy ever since.It may be the single best of the HillSpencer collaborations wonderfully silly and harmlessly violent.  HillSpencer films have always reminded me of the better Warner Bros. cartoon shorts  as if the Wolf and the Sheep Dog interrupted their longrunning battle of wits and teamed up to save the peaceful sheepherders from the evil cattlemen.If you like slapstick humour that falls somewhere between Hope  Crosby Laurel  Hardy and the Three Stooges but more physical than any of those this is a film you should see.".

I've been looking for a copy ever since.It may be the single best of the HillSpencer collaborations wonderfully silly and harmlessly violent.  HillSpencer films have always reminded me of the better Warner Bros. cartoon shorts  as if the Wolf and the Sheep Dog interrupted their longrunning battle of wits and teamed up to save the peaceful sheepherders from the evil cattlemen.If you like slapstick humour that falls somewhere between Hope  Crosby Laurel  Hardy and the Three Stooges but more physical than any of those this is a film you should see.";

I'll stop here....I don't want to tell the end of the movie! Just go rent it....that will be hard for Americans because this movie isnt released there. The best scenes are Kid and Ben singing in the Choir the jousting on motor cycles and the fight in the gym and the fight at the Restaurant! Its too bad that many people dont like the fight humor in TB films! I'd perfer these anyday to Hollywood type movies! People who dont understand these movies should lighten up and realise how funny they are! If you liked this movie i suggest these 1. They call me trinity 2. trinity is still my name! 3. crime busters 4. odds and evens 5. Flatfoot aka Piedone lo Sbirro   W.O.W.M. gets a  910   !!!!!!!!".

No you must see the Bud Spencer and Terence Hill movies in a different way because it's nearly always the same concept a concept which I personally like very muchIn the beginning of the story there are always those two guys  sometimes brothers or rivals  who don't estimate or even hate each other and who are often very poor. Terence Hill Mario Girotti is always the sportyslander blueeyed and blond angeltype who is oozing a good feeling to his environment whereas Bud Spencer Carlo Pedersoli symbolizes the grumpy unshaved fat and violent devil which nobody would like to come too close voluntarily. But the characters differ from their outward appearance The good is underhanded and looks always for trouble which must be solved by the bad by the means of little slaps. Like every human they're searching for a great fortune to have a better life. During their adventures they have to face different  dangerous situations where  though they don't like each other  nobody could stand without the other. On the surface there is always a harsh rejection but inside of those two guys there is one big and important thing love. They couldn't exist without each other. This might sound too much humanistic but that's the way it is. The filmmakers might be no philosophers but instinctively they did something great Because in the end they have often loads of money but not for long au contraire they loose it immediately  easy come and easy go! But they do not only help each other no often they help the poor and the weak. So isn't that fantastic my friends. And there's still one thing about these films it's humor. There are different kinds of humors around the world e.g. asian and british  so that might be the reason why the comment of the english friend was so negative and don't forget the translation problem!. In german the humor of the duo infernale films is great it should be even better than in the original italian language as my buddy Andreas Kropp who is half german half italian told me.Don't expect cineastic masterpieces but lean back and enjoy the films of with Bud Spencer and Terence Hill!".

	schema:reviewBody " Minor spoilers and bad guy ultimate plot revealed in last paragraph but it's so stupid you want to know it. Long and rant filled review.Let's start with 10 stars.Rosie and Shia wouldn't know how to fake chemistry if someone wrapped a lead pipe in the periodic table and beat them upside their botoxed faces for an hour. The romance part is so awful so cheesy in this movie it takes down a star right off the bat. I will also mention the romance between Optimus Prime and America  the one and only real and holy country in the world. puke 9  10.Rosie has to be mentioned again as a standalone entry. I can imagine how the casting went.. Bay walks into modeling agency closes his eyes and says Eeny meeny miny moe you're the clone that comes along! thereby picking out the 403rd pair of tits in the lineup. A horrible actress pretentious character and a so obnoxiously unnecessary role the movie would have been two stars better if she were not there at all. Also lips are not supposed to look like that. If I was Shia I'd worry Are you sure your lips don't hurt? Can we kiss? Won't a stitch break or something?7  10.At one point a guy hacks a bridge. He logs into the bridge control  and lowers it. Hollywood bridges do not have an open internet connection with a designated port for Bridge Control API otherwise every hacker would be lowering and raising bridges everywhere.6  10.Since the black guy stereotypes in Transformers2 got some bad rep Bay went the other way this time  Irish and Scottish. Yes there is a green robot with an Irish accent and a red robot with a huge belly and a beard with a Scottish accent. How did that happen? Did they scan an IreScot when they landed instead of a car? If so weren't they supposed to turn into the robotterminatorchick type from Transformers 2?5  10.Physics. Oh god the physics. Dear Michael Bay please realize the following a Moon sand is a highly corrosive and metalunfriendly substance. Any kind of moving metalpart coming in that much contact with it would self destruct by the time it made 3 steps. b One plane was enough to collapse a Twin Tower into dust. A seventy million billion ton robot shooting and crashing into a building will not make it tilt slightly and when that building falls it will not get stuck between two others like a bridge ever regardless what it's made of especially if that same robot is still crawling through it and destroying chunks. c When stuff explodes near people people tend to be stunned burned and  or get shrapnel shot into their spines. They do not sit idly by and contemplate the situation. So if a grenade explodes in an office cubicle next to the one where the protagonist is standing he will most probably DIE. d You cannot grab a SHARP MAD DANGEROUS robot by the neck and keep it in control. You will LOSE YOUR FINGERS. e Do you have any idea how much extra it costs to send an extra kilogram into space in a shuttle? Now imagine how much fuel and money you would need to send 10 millionton robots into space with a regular human space shuttle launcher. f When people fly through glass they ALWAYS get cut. When they fly through 10 panes of glass they DIE. When they fly through 20 they DON'T because they got impaled on the 12th or 13th.410Stealing characters from other franchises just for the kick of it is not cool. You have a predator robot a robot that is Q from James Bond etc. What...?3  10.Plot If I was an evil genius and built a warturning technology I definitely would not build it so that it has exactly one weak point that if struck undoes absolutely everything it ever did and I would definitely not leave it exposed. The bad guys' ultimate plan was to teleport their PLANET to Earth's atmosphere in order to rebuild it. This raises several issues 1 You would have approximately 10 minutes to live before Earth and Cybertron collided due to gravity. Those 10 minutes would be filled with an apocalypse due to uncontrollable floods caused by tides. 2 If you want 6 billion people for the sole purpose of slave labor you should think about point 1. Also it is stupid to believe 6 billion people could rebuild a robotic planet sooner or better than 1000 decepticons  you not only have to accommodate and feed the people but also modify the planet's surface for them to be able to move on it. 3 There is a part where Megatron is chillaxing in an alley after a big fight and the flatlipped wonder of a modelclone that is Carly comes up to him spewing some bullshit about the other bad guy getting ready to betray him. Now even if she made a point I would still CRUSH that human insect. A meaningless pretentious bitch telling me what to think? I'm a god damn eleventy billion ton robot you skank! crush The other critically stupid thing is the fact that Megatron then prevents the other bad guy from killing Optimus. If you have two enemies who are fighting it is generally not a good idea to prevent them from killing each other! And while we're here the decepticons could have won if the bad guy had just used one of the 994208 chances to kill Optimus he's had up until this point.This brings the movie down to 110 but I'll give it a star for excellent special effects. 210.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm going to commit what to many will seem like film geek treason I will now connect Michael Bay and Terrence Malick into one theory of filmmaking.Yep deal with it.Malick and Bay share one important thing and that is a completely unabashed tunnelvision for the type of film they want damn the naysayers critics and crowds. They both make movies mainly for themselves and in truth there is nothing wrong with that. As an audience member you need to know going in exactly what you are going to get. It is the only way to really enjoy anything that falls from the cameras of these two and some other notables. With that said let's dive headlong into the metallic masterpiece of summertime popcorn Transformers!Transformers Dark of the Moon continues the story of Sam Witwicky and his Autobot friends. While Sam struggles to gain a purpose in life outside of Decepticon attacks the Autobots are off helping the government on secret missions. Then everything is torn apart by the discovery of the original Autobot escape ship known as The Ark and the captain of that ship Sentinel Prime. He alone holds the key to technology that could either help reshape the Transformers home world or completely destroy ours. The Decepticons completely aware of this discovery make an immediate power play and the war is back bigger than ever.Kids buying the Transformer toys today only want one thing huge robots in spectacular 3D slow motion destroying each other and every building in sight. From this narrow viewpoint Bay delivers in bulk. The highway fight sequence brought back memories of other highspeed terror scenes like in Matrix Reloaded and The Island maybe a little too reminiscent of that last one according to some eagle eyed movie nerds. Since Bay actually filmed these scenes in the latest and greatest 3D technology it was admittedly pretty amazing to watch. In other scenes some of the CGI was so intensely crisp that it actually started popping too far from the live footage making it stand out which ruins a little of the illusion.So the special effects is where it was at. Big robots big explosions big buildings falling down. Those were the high points.The low points were pretty much everything else.Standing in the center of all the toysonroids insanity is Shia LaBeouf who in my opinion is a really good actor banking inside really bad movies. I can't fault him for taking parts in some of the biggest franchises in movie history Transformers and Indiana Jones because the exposure and paycheck are nearly impossible to pass up but in terms of showing his skills as an actor those hefty titles have done him nothing but a painful disservice. He made his big splash on the scene in the Disney TV show Even Stevens and then on the big screen in the Rear Window update Disturbia. Many people also don't remember one of my personal favorite performances in the Project Greenlightsponsored film The Battle of Shaker Heights. Shia has the chops but gets surrounded by weak emotional performances both from CGI and real people. In this outing Megan Fox's eye candy character was replaced by Victoria Secret's model and current Jason Statham girlfriend Rosie HuntingtonWhiteley. Whiteley was an improvement in sense of acting ability but the part was written levels below what Fox was given. The original love interest had layers depth and some edge while Whiteley was given virtually no background no emotional outlet and nothing to do but stand there and be hot. Sure the 12year old in the audience doesn't want or need more but to them I say Go grab a Victoria Secret's catalog from your parent's bathroom and stay out of my movie.Beyond the magical pair of leads Bay brings back the regular tough guys Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson to keep on keeping on. They both do fine jobs and don't try to make this more than it is. Coming in for the first time in the franchise is Frances McDormand an Academy Award winner to class up the joint. While she was amusing and brought a little more skill to the screen her part was borderline overthetop even in a movie with three story tall robots because she had to balance out John Tuturro who drifts somewhere off to Hunter S. Thompson land. As if they weren't enough Bay decides to bring in an unusual amount of big name cameos including John Malkovich who does a decent job in his few scenes and Ken Jeong who seems to be acting in a completely different movie possibly thinks he's filming Hangover 3. I saved the best for last though my personal favorite and the only person I was actually thrilled to see appear on screen Alan Tudyk who plays Tuturo's assistantbodyguard. Tudyk is a cult TV and film legend to his legions of fans spanning from the days of Firefly Dollhouse and other projects not created by Joss Wheedon. Tudyk was the one person I actually cheered form when he magically appeared on screen.I could go into a section now where I talk about the story the plot lines the connective tissue of the writing but in reality Bay didn't really care and neither do the younger members of the crowd so let's just skip it.The End of the Page recommendation Transformers Dark of the Moon starts slow goes out with a bang and delivers surface entertainment for the middle school crowd.".

	schema:headline " Well I pretty much got what I was expecting.";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm seriously surprised at most of the reviews that streamed about this movie. I think that critics and movie reviewers need some perspective this is a Michael Bay film about transforming robots that kids used to play with including me so I went in with the right amount of expectations and got a very impressive visual experience. Now I'm not giving Micheal Bay an excuse to make a bad film but as far his movies go this is definitely one of his finer ones.It has both its pros and cons. Pros The story is a HUGE improvement over the second one with some good twists added there and then albeit a bit long. Now it's not Phenomenal story telling but acceptable enough for a good fun summer action film. The character development is able to keep me watching since the second one had absolutely NONE of it. The SFX are fantastic. This movie has the best CGI out of all 3 in the trilogy. Even the smallest robots look very realistic. The action scenes are AMAZING. I could actually differentiate between the good guys and bad guys this time its amazing how much more depth it adds to the scenes. The highway scene is my favourite from the movie. The robots also get a lot more screen time and pay a more important part to the story than before. Unlike in the second one each robot gets a fair amount of screen time and does something useful instead of just being the military's attack dogs.The cons The humor is unnecessary and unfunny although it has been cu down to minimal amounts .The romance is useless and awkward. The two main leads don't have any chemistry and I don't see why Shia needs to be paired up with a hot supermodel every film or why he still even needs to be there at all. The acting is meh shia and josh are great but the rest of the cast is pretty...meh. Rosie has very little acting talent although she is a slight improvement over megan fox in terms of acting. The soundtrack is awesome but it sounds very very similar to the scores in the Dark Knight and Inception. The decepticons are still portrayed as mere evil destruction machines who hate everything i wish they were more developed characters and that the relationships between the robots were explored more I mean whenever any bot dies the others are literally cool with it two seconds later and do not mention the incident again. SPOILER Megatron is no longer the evil villain bent on dominian instead he's simply the anti hero who is solely focused on saving his planet HE EVEN SAVES PRIME'S LIFE at the last second simply because Rosie called him sentinel's bitchSPOILER.The biggest problem which I had with the ending is that it is wrapped up too quickly another 2 mins would have been fine. The movie's run time is very long the first hour could've been done in 10 minutes.Overall I think the movie is able to deliver a very entertaining experience. Yes the trilogy would have been better in different hands but I was able to enjoy it as much as I did the first one. Just don't go in expecting anything revolutionary or brilliant turn of your mind ready the pop corn and enjoy.My rating 710".

	schema:headline " Where will the explosions stop?";
	schema:reviewBody "Around a half hour into watching the third installment in the Michael Bay driven Transformers franchise a very serious thought entered my head.What the f is this movie?I really am not sure where to begin when discussing such a chaotic mess that seemed like a 6 hour movie stuffed into a two and a half hour potato sack and beaten repeatedly with a pillow case filled with bars of soap.I guess we can start with the goals that seemed to be laid out in making this third film.First off action and CGI were without a doubt the number one priority in this film. This makes complete sense. The action and CGI is really exciting to look at and a getaway for some viewers when they see a film robots transforming from cars buildings collapsing from the sky soldiers flying into battle in wing suits and what must have been thousands of explosions all in 3D.The next objective had to be comic relief. If you are a minor character you will say something funny. If you are a small transforming robot you will definitely say something funny. Don't forget to make the jokes a little more vulgar than the first two films and even a little cheesier. Cheese sells.The last major objective had to be how much sex appeal can we put in this movie. I suppose when you cast the likes of a Victoria Secret model in her first role in a film see my previous article about Ms. HuntingtonWhiteley from yesterday and the hunky doctor from Grey's Anatomy your film is set to draw boys and girls alike.The film accomplishes all of these goals but at what cost now it's as if I'm talking in an Optimus Prime voice. What about story? Coherence? Character development? Audience to character relationship?It seems like I am just beating a dead horse over and over again or a horse that surely does more coke than Tony Montana when directing his films but I am more and more offended each time I see a Michael Bay film. Even more so I am offended every time some moron in the theater tonight started clapping when Bumble Bee had a stellar looking upper cut kill or Rosie HuntingtonWhiteley stood slowmo with explosions blasting all around her not joking they clapped.Transformers Dark of the Moon is a bumbling mess of fire and loud noises and is just another film for Michael Bay to add to the references on his resume for most ridiculous director of all time.Even worse is the flow and logic of Dark of the Moon. I have seen plenty of films to accept that not understanding what is going on doesn't really matter but it is different with a mainstream blockbuster. When watching a David Lynch film you can expect something like this. When watching a film about transforming robots coherence should be somewhat standard.For the first hour and a half of the film I had no idea what city the film was in. I heard Sam Shia LaBeouf say DC early on so I assumed that was where we were. But then his girlfriend Carly Huntington Whiteley worked at the Milwaukee Art Museum it took a while to realize that the museum was now fictionally home to her boss and a fight takes place on a highway listing signs to Aurora and Rt. 20 names that any Chicago kid would recognize. Hell the headquarters of NEST is clearly the downtown loop area.So after a certain transformer leaves the NEST headquarters and is next to the reflecting pool in DC moments later I thought either Bay has decided his audience will have no idea what length of time passes from cut to cut or Milwaukee and Chicago are now Washington DC. I think the answer is the latter but I am still not sure.This is just one example of the incoherence that can be found in this film like how Bumble Bee saves Sam in the middle of the battle and moments later is on his knees for execution by the hands of the decepticons. It is bewildering how unorganized this film is.Maybe the final goal of Michael Bay in this film was to bring back memories of some of the most significant events in the United States since the 1960s. The film includes the Apollo 11 story a rocket ship blowing up after take off that is extremely familiar to the Challenger explosion in 1986 and as if the event being referenced wasn't fresh in many minds sky scrapers tumbling to the ground and characters falling out of windows to their death.There seemed to be no goal to the film other than mind fluff expensive loud and annoyingly repetitive mind fluff. As a major credit to the special effects and CGI team the film's action is a tremendous accomplishment. The problem is the success is contained in a film that has absolutely no other redeeming qualities.Transformers Dark of the Moon is almost too bad to describe. I would like to say it contains the worst story and flow in any movie I have ever seen but that would just seem overly dramatic. I will say this there were much better ways I could have spent my 15.50 and two and a half hours of my life than seeing this film. There have been enough films with explosions in the last five years to not have one for another 50.".

	schema:headline " Amazing visual spectacle but tedious and full of clichs";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is certainly an outstanding visual spectacle that boasts some of the most impressive fluid and stunning cgi sequences I've ever seen. The photography is fantastic and the 3d technology is used effectively to create stunning visually amazing scenes. However that is the only aspect of the film that I believe deserves merit at all. Despite the continuous action destruction and battles I found this film to be extremely boring and the final battle which claimed the last hour of the film was far too long and drawn out and it greatly prevented me from appreciating the visual spectacle that is the final battle as it's so long it becomes tedious and I couldn't wait for it to end. The extensive use of cgi action scenes was what ruined the film for me and although I never fully agree with the typical view that modern films have too much cgi and effects and not enough good story this film certainly presented a convincing case that the above statement is true. As there is so much shooting exploding and fighting in this film there is relatively little time for dialogue which was largely poorly written and full of clichs. Finally I didn't rate the casting of Rosie HuntingtonWhiteley or her performance. She has clearly been chosen for the role for her good looks and her great sex appeal although I think she shines brighter as an underwear model than blockbuster film actress. Also It seems unbelievable to me that Shia LaBeouf's character although not a bad looking guy has been in relationships with 2 characters played by women who have both topped the annual FHM 100 sexiest women in the world poll. Rosie has clearly been cast to attract more male viewers bring sex appeal that the film didn't really need and throughout struck me as being far out of Shia's league.".

	schema:headline " Dear Mr Bay  Transformers 3";
	schema:reviewBody "Dear Mr Bay After recently viewing your latest movie I couldn't help but feel you need a few tips on a General movie making and plot writing b Making a Transformers movie Although I know nothing of these I feel I could still do a much much better job than you did with your latest movie. So here goes.To begin with when writing a plot it is often a very good idea to stick with a few simple ideas unless you're making Inception but please don't try this as I'm already cringing at thought. As you have probably found or will soon find people don't like it when you try to add little pieces together to make one big whole this just doesn't work out to be a good story or a very well thought out story. Hence the gaping plot holes in your latest story. For example if the Decepticons had been removing pillars from the Dark Side of the Moon years and years ago what was the point of the first two movies? With a movie it is also a good idea to not try build suspense at every turn have massive pivotal moments that last 5 seconds and insignificant pointless moments that last 15 minutes. And just because you found a girl that you thought could replace Megan Fox doesn't mean that she needs to have long freeze frame shots heroic moments or even to be in the movie. And not every character has to be a hero. Optimus Prime definitely Bumble Bee understandable Sam Witwicky...maybe in a human kind of way. But not every character with a small speaking part needs to be a hero and change the course of history if that was the case then everyone would just be normal and there wouldn't ever be heroes right? Also when casting characters don't pick every minor comedic actor that auditions because similar to the piecemeal nature of your story line lots of minor comedic actors don't make for a funny movie. And when I went to see the Transformers 3 movie I didn't say Hey that'll be hilarious I said Awesome I can't wait for epic fight scenes and intense visual and audial effects that make me excited for days after Which leads me to my next 2 major problems.I understand that you just make movies but you'd think that you'd understand the two things that made the first Transformers and saved the second. Epic AutobotDecepticon fight scenes and amazing transforming sounds. Both of which your movie lacked or pretty much ignored. The only reasons I said I'd return to a Transformers movie after the failure of the second one but for some reason you thought it's be fine without these things and that you could fill the movie with ridiculous amounts of human characters explosions and epic moments.And to top it all off you make 2 little pet transformers that annoyed the audience throughout the movie have one of the most pivotal moments in the victory of the Autobots! And then the new Transformers girl who should stick to modeling by the way convinces Megatron the absolute evil and most powerful Decepticon to kill Sentinel Prime! Why the heck wouldn't he just squash her? This would probably have saved the movie in my opinion but sadly we can add this to the long line of missed opportunities in your movie.But the worse thing that you could have possibly done...is killed off Ironhide in the way that he was killed. You're talking about the weapons and combat expert of the Autobots the heavy unit second only to Optimus and you kill him off like he was one of your several other dispensable characters. How do you sleep at night? I just find it hard to believe that after the last Transformers movie you actually managed to make a worse movie. I mean here was your chance at redemption something simple maximum transformer fighting maximum transforming sounds! It looks so good in my head! But then I think about what you did...and it all crumbles and my heart dies just a little more.So my advice to you is maybe you should really try and understand what the Transformers is all about it doesn't have to be complicated you don't have to have 5000 transformers or characters for that matter. Keep it simple stupid. Fewer characters fewer epic moments more transforming more transformer fighting Optimus blitzing it out with any Decepticons who cross his path awesome Bumble BeeIron Hide combo kills Sam calls his girlfriend to say whats up but nothing more from her because she can't act very well Ironhide dies a noble death if needs be although questionable no comedy and just one epic world saving moment not 50.And my advice for anyone going to see the movie...don't.Make up your own ideal Transformers 3 story line and watch Transformers 1 again.I wish I had.So thank you Mr Bay for ruining something I held so dear.Yours totally and utterly sincerely Jamie Stronge.".

	schema:headline " I have seen the future of horror and his name is Michael Bay";
	schema:reviewBody "He has now made two blockbuster movies which make no sense no matter how many ways you try to put them together and people don't seem to care. The critics have brutally trashed both this movie and The Fallen movie yet audiences love both films although they seem to have been put together by a group of 2nd graders who playing out randomly strung together old cartoon episodes with their toys. I am an old school fan who liked the first two movies but Dark of the Moon makes Fallen look like Shakespeare. It's incredible how many people are saying that this movie is better than Fallen. With all its faults at least Fallen had humor some incredible action sequences and effects and an interesting if incomplete script. This movie has none of these things. This is a very long and boring movie that wastes the talents of good actors. The attempts at humor are painful to watch. The three Transformers movies cannot be connected now no matter how hard you try. To make another sequel would be ludicrous but seeing how much money this drivel is making already I bet they have already taken the five minutes needed to write the next one. The original writers were smart to bail out of this train wreck after Bay made them write Fallen in a couple of days and went on to butcher the little that they had time to write. This time there was no writers' strike so I expected betterlike explanations and connections across all three films. You'll get none of that here just more incomprehensible nonsense that ignores the other films. You don't know what's going on half the time and the final battle has no pacing motivation or orientationit just drags on and on and onlike that 20 minute desert sequence in The Fallen multiplied by 10. What happened to the Cube's knowledge in Sam's brain? Why was Sentinel Prime's ship shot down by the people that were working with him? How was Megatron going to rendezvous with him if they ended up finding earth in different time periods? Why did Megatron go after the cube if the original plan seemed to be to enslave earth and transport Cybertron there using the space bridge? How did Sentinel's ship crash on earth's moon if it was shot down over Cybertron? Why didn't Megatron go after the Space Bridge parts when he awoke in the first movie? Why didn't he after he awoke in the second movie? Why didn't they use the shard in the second movie to activate Sentinel on the moon instead of Megatron? How did Sentinel the Cube and the Sun Harvester all end up on earth? Why are the Transformers not even bothering to project human images in their car modes anymore? Why does Prime carry The Matrix of Leadership a key to activate the Sun Harvester inside of him and use it to energize Autobots which it is not meant to do? When why and how did an entire army of generic Decepticons hide inside of the moon? Why do the Transformers transform? These are just a few of about a hundred questions that this movie brings up. I suspect that not even Michael Bay knows the answers and he doesn't care. it's insulting.There are some good ideas but it's all put together very badly and not much is explained. Watching this movie gave me the feeling that Bay and the actors are here to wrap this up and are not interested in this material. The studios will be pressuring him to make 4 so he can get some 3rd graders together to write a script againyet another group of Autobots has been buried in a volcano for 4 million years! They can transform to dinosaurs no explanation is necessary. Out of all of the planets in the infinite universe their ship crashed on earth because...well because the script says so. They were looking for the cube no the Harvester no the space bridge no wait...they were looking for the ancestor of Michael Bay. If Bay is never born these movies would never exist and we can reboot.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to say I enjoyed watching Transformers 3. If you take it for what it is a Michael Bay movie with awesome epic visuals an overthe top weak plot not very deep characters and classic 'Bay' humor then it's great. Not as good as the first but easily better than the 2nd one. First off the visual effects are amazing. One of the best if not the best that I've seen both in details on the transformers in actionfighting sequences and in more general landscape shots  the views of Chicago when it was being attacked by decepticons were great. I watched it in 3D in the theater and it was arguably the best 3D effects I've seen and best use of 3D cameras and that is including Avatar which i also saw in 3D. This is what Michael Bay is really good at and this movie shows he is arguably the expert in visual effects and composition.visual effects and presentation  1010The plot isn't great. When it starts out it seems like it might develop nicely into a moderately complex story rooted in some historical events that happened very differently than how we thought kind of like the hoover dam part in the first transformers but in the end not much is made of that and the plot is relatively direct and overthetop. However it does have a few good moments that offer a bit more complexity or emotion and anyways I didn't watch the movie hoping for a subtle complex and nuanced plot.Plot  610The characters and acting aren't Oscarworthy either to say the least. Rosie HuntingtonWhitely is not a great actress in fact she isn't really an actress and it shows but to be honest I have seen worse performances. Shia Labeouf is decent in his role as usual. and again there are some new characters including some for Michael Bay esque comic relief which in my opinion is actually funnier than much of the humor in revenge of the fallen which felt a little too forced to me.Charactersacting  610Fun  810If you're expecting a layered nuanced movie with deep characterization and a complex and wellwritten plot well then don't watch this. If though you want a fun blockbuster with truly amazing visual effects a decent but forgettable storyline and characterization and an easy to follow dynamic well you'll probably like Transformers 3.".

In case you don't know the six 'Cs' are chases clashes crashes combustions carnage and cleavage. Spread over a bottomnumbing twoandahalf hours Transformers Dark Of The Moon can also induce mental and metal fatigue especially with the clanging robots smashing one another  and the whole exercise making little sense.Technologically however Dark Of The Moon is Bay's best work so far  and action fans looking to be awed by scenes of massive mayhem and destruction in 3D should be satisfied. Storywise this one is better than Revenge Of The Fallen but not as fun and emotionallyconnecting as the first.The film opens with a flashback to the Sixties Apollo landing mission where history is rewritten by Ehren Kruger to incorporate the coverup of an alien spaceship crashing on the moon. That spaceship of course is one of the remains of the epic battles between the Autobots and the Decepticons and its 'discovery' sparks off another war that threatens to destroy planet Earth. Or at least the face of Chicago as we know it.On the human level we find that Sam Witwicky Shia LaBeouf has traded in his girlfriend Mikaela Megan Fox for a newer model a Victoria Secret one to be exact in the shape of Rosie HuntingtonWhiteley as Carly. Sam is being offered a job by Bruce Brazos John Malkovich but we soon learn that Carly's boss Dylan Patrick Dempsey may be up to no good. Then when the conflict between the Autobots and Decepticons hots up Captain Lennox Josh Duhamel and Sergeant Epps Tyrese Gibson of the elite Government squad NEST are summarily called into action.We get lulled into believing that there may somehow be an intelligent plot coming from the conspiracy of the NASA lunarlanding coverup which also involves the Russian space program and Chernobyl. These turn out to be just an exercise in 'historical namedropping' to spur our interest before we get to the demolition derby created by the Transformers. Indeed some of the robots seem to emote better that the live cast. Cybertron leader Sentinel Prime for example is even designed to look like Leonard Nimoy who provides its voice complete with stuff that looks like beard. Again the problems of the previous installments recur  like the confusion between the good and bad robots in the clashes.Unlike the first two movies there are no more gags about the shock of humans interacting with the mechanical 'bots. Bay however insists on some comic sequences and he has hired Ken Jeong to do his inyourface shtick as Jerry Wang. John Turturro reprises his role as former FBI agent Simmons but this time around Turturro finds it fit to clown around with his role. The most striking inclusion to the cast is Rosie HuntingtonWhiteley as Sam's love interest. However with limited acting talent she provides only eyecandy and beside her Megan Fox would look like an Oscarcaliber actress.Like the first Transformers this one is also a liveaction cartoon on a grand scale. Scenes of Chicago buildings being toppled and destroyed can be as spectacular and brainnumbing as those of September 11 and the wingsuit flying sequences are breathtaking. Indeed these are what most of Michael Bay's fans pay for and they will not be disappointed. The only problem for me is that Bay prolongs and repeats the robotic clash sequences to the point of being selfindulgent. Technically brilliant and visually arresting Dark Of The Moon lacks heart and soul. limchangmoh.blogspot.com".

In advance i'd like to apologize for using the world ridiculous too many times but that's the best one to describe this masterpiece. of course one would expect that a story about 30 m high robots is a little bit ridiculous but it was really over the top. After things started going there wasn't a single minute in the film where something utterly ridiculous did not happen. So many examples... I'll list some of them and some of my problemsthe chick checks the 2 evil robots with the spyglass sees that they have an argument. later on she decides to turn megatron against the bearded guy the super villain high tech robot megatron and she persuades him. yeah that's right. that's some neat intrigue you might expect from hose luis Fernando from a Brazilian soap opera you get it here with a super robot in a 100 million dollar budget film with Steven Spielberg's name. they don't stop telling each other secrets of the government. no question no reason it's needed because the story can't progress so why not tell something that's been a state secret for 30 years or even yell it in front of 30 people. every time this happens you just ask loudly in your chair WHY THE HELL DID HE TELL THAT? but there's never an answerno one thinks forward in the movie not even the decepticons. the bug just came off the main guy's wrist after the decepticons thought the auto bots left.why the hell did it come off and just left the guy that has been a major pain in the ass for the decepticons in the past decade? why didn't it stay on him or kill him? humans don't kill each other even if it would be in their best interest. no they let the hostage live and tell secrets so he can escape and ruin their plans. the robots somehow avoid killing humans until the last part of the movie the movie has some weird comical parts some of them childish and they don't kill any humans in the first half of the movie. but then there is a gay joke and at the end the human killing strangely begins decepticons shoot people to ash and their skull rolls on the ground after they evaporated. so please mr bay decide if you want a movie for the audience of spy kidsand don't show sexualviolent stuff or make a scifi for adults and don't make it retarded. they replaced Megan fox with this blonde chick a significant portion of the movie was centered around her ass or boobs. this was actually a semivalid reason to look at this terrible piece of a movie but is this really justified in a scifi?. and btw she's 10 cm higher than the protagonist and she can't act. they keep fighting with idiotic weapons optimus even has a flame ax or what the heck now. really. super high tech robots equipped with huge ass cannons fight like tom cruise in the last samurai with close combat weapons. optimus prime even had some kind of fight position at the start of one fight like a martial artist which looked really stupid.they couldn't think of a decent new villain so they just repeated the one in the last episode. an ancient robot on top of a big building doing some kind of intergalactic mambo jumbo for half an hour. pretty lame also what's up with robots having beard mustache hair out of metal it isn't bad ass it's idioticstarscream has the ability to shoot a missile that utterly destroys a gigantic space ship full of auto bots. meanwhile throughout the movie the high tech super intelligent robots keep fighting with knives and swords. no comment the trend continues new robots appear that resemble some ridiculous characters. we have a fat robot now old ones with beard and male pattern baldness troll doll robot an eagle robot that flies with metallic wings not engines megatron gets a hood and looks like some dark wanderer now and my favorite his lackey the HUNCHBACK robot. yeah that's right. megatron has the robot version of the hunchback of Notre dame. that sole character that they attempted to take it seriously made the whole thing retarded even without the countless other stupid characters and scenes of the movie that would only satisfy a mentally handicapped teenagerlaws of physics work differently in the movie. collapsing buildingsrobots avoid humans a metallic building structure hangs in the air in a ridiculous position the scientist robot sucks a whole metal PLANET through a portal right next to earth and nothing happens and btw first the summoning is interrupted and there is a planet cut in half near earth with a plainly cut surface at the intersection and then the summoning is restored and it CONTINUES to come out of the portal.. somebody before this planetportal scene mentions that they wanna make the humans slaves to rebuild the planet.later robots are slaying humans left and right killing everyone. that's clever killing your slaves full of idiotic clichs like the grand American speech of the commander to talk soldiers into impossible mission we only need one shot etc really anyone finds these cheap and badthe protagonist's parents are so annoying they make you wanna kill the writer of the script slowly and painfullyetc etccould go on for about 3 pages... really don't watch this movie if you want yourself good. visuals make it a worthy 210".

	schema:headline " A Big Improvement from Revenge of the Fallen";
	schema:reviewBody "As a huge fan of the Transformers animated series I like the first Transformers film. The visuals were spectacular and so were the fighting scenes When I saw Transformers 2 which is a HUGE mess of a film I was really angry. I vowed never to see a Transformers film ever again. But when the trailer of Transformers 3 came out I actually got a little interested. I mean the special effects were pretty much great as usual. But this time it seemed they took off the annoying little robots and that annoying mother and replaced them with good old fashioned action.When I went to an advanced screening yesterday I still came in with relatively low expectations. I have to say that Transformers 3 is an overall improvement from its predecessor Transformers 2. The film was pretty much at level with the first film though. The action scenes were highly extravagant and at times pretty epic. The movie had a lot less lame scenes which is always a plus. The acting was okay. Megan Fox's replacement Rosie HuntingtonWhiteley was okay but she's certainly not a good actress but a mediocre one actually I liked her more than Megan Fox. I liked how the movie used the Apollo landing as a part of its story like in Forrest Gump. However there were so many characters that were extremely thinly written. John Turturro's character was definitely not needed and some of the dialogue was incoherent and very messy at times. The movie is also way too long at 157 minutes wow. I thought the last scene with Megatron was completely rushed and so was the ending. Although the last hour of the film is pretty epic at times so I was fulfilled with the visual effects.Overall I rate Transformers 3 an 710. Don't go in expecting a Best Picture winnernominee. With the right amount of expectations you will probably be fulfilled. A definite improvement over Revenge of the Fallen which doesn't say much. But at the end the great special effects and extremely extravagant action scenes more than make up its flaws. I'd recommend this film if you like the franchise.".

	schema:headline " Transformers 3 The Good The Bad and The Ugly";
	schema:reviewBody "Man so much stuff happens in this damn movie. One can only scratch the surface of what the movie has to offer when reviewing it. The best I can do is list the best and worst of it.The GoodThe best thing about these movies is how they look how well the transformers integrate into the reallife footage to make a compelling action sequence. Here it's cranked to eleven and the CG is very impressive. On the larger shots even tiny transformers far in the background look convincing.There a several action set pieces specifically towards the end which are easily some of the best of the trilogy. The whole scene with the collapsing building and the tracking shot of Optimus slicing and smashing his way through a bunch of decepticons are colossal showstoppers.This is also one of the best 3D movies to date. One major critique of 3D is that 3D glasses make the film darker but here they do a very smart thing the film itself is brighter than your average movie and this problem evens itself out. Another thing that worried me before I saw it is that if there was so much highspeed action maybe that and the combination of 3D would give me motion sickness end of the movie no problems.The BadThe villains suck. Megatron does absolutely nothing throughout the whole film until right at the end and even that was a let down. Shockwave appears briefly at the start and vanishes for two hours he himself doesn't actually do much it's all down to this big nameless tentacleclad decepticon he works with. Starscream does nothing but then he never did anything anyway. I'm not even going to mention Patrick Dempsey. But the biggest let down is with the movies main villain Sentinel Prime. Basically he is Optimus' predecessor but he changed sides to the decepticons and made a deal with Megatron to bring life back to their home planet Cybertron. This is the driving element of the movie but there are many plot holes from this. Early in the film Optimus basically says he wants to make Sentinel Prime leader of the autobots again and offers him the matrix an item that brings dead transformers back to life but Sentinel Prime declines. Then he changes sides. Why did he decline taking the matrix? it would in definitely be a help in his ploy. Sentinel Prime gets numerous chances to kill Optimus once and for all but like all lousy villains he delays his hand and Optimus lives.The productplacement is out of control. I am not joking when I say there is a scene where Shia LaBeouf stops the movie to recite a Mercerdes CommercialThe annoying characters from the last movie are gone save one. The little autobot who humped Megan Fox's leg makes a return. Just be thankful there's no Skids and MudflapThe DownRight UglyThe acting here is a range from Tolerable to ImpossiblyBad. There are actors here that have been in some high quality material that just blatantly signed onto this because A they wanted a paycheck B they have nothing else on their schedules I mean John Malkovich and Frances McDormand are Oscar nominees who are so unbelievably bad in this movie they make Shia Lebeouf look like Laurence Olivier and Rosie HuntingtonWhiteley is the stiffest most wooden actress i've seen in ages. John Turturro is awkward but after three movies I don't care anymore.Stereotypes ahoy not as prominent as before but it's here. We have Tyrese Gibson and some other black guy fistbump and ridicule one another. We have LeBeouf call a Japanese man MotoMushiIchi and decepticons with dreadlocks. Plus that gay guy from the hangover makes an appearance as some loony scientist but luckily Michael Bay had the sense to drop him out of a window.Some visceral American moments like using the moon landing to spark the movies plot. Also blowing up the statue of Lincoln to let Megatron sit on the chair instead. Since i'm British I didn't care for these scenes that are obviously meant to say to American audiences These decepticons are blowing up America! Damn Them!In Conclusion I may have some major complaints with this movie but it is a ton of fun. The movie delivers on everything it promises and everything you expect and not a single dull moment. If you loved the first movie and loved the second movie god help you I can guarantee you will love this movie even more. I'd say the definitive summer film this year has been made clear.So.. Viewing Audience.. Roll Out...".

	onyx:emotionText "Man so much stuff happens in this damn movie. One can only scratch the surface of what the movie has to offer when reviewing it. The best I can do is list the best and worst of it.The GoodThe best thing about these movies is how they look how well the transformers integrate into the reallife footage to make a compelling action sequence. Here it's cranked to eleven and the CG is very impressive. On the larger shots even tiny transformers far in the background look convincing.There a several action set pieces specifically towards the end which are easily some of the best of the trilogy. The whole scene with the collapsing building and the tracking shot of Optimus slicing and smashing his way through a bunch of decepticons are colossal showstoppers.This is also one of the best 3D movies to date. One major critique of 3D is that 3D glasses make the film darker but here they do a very smart thing the film itself is brighter than your average movie and this problem evens itself out. Another thing that worried me before I saw it is that if there was so much highspeed action maybe that and the combination of 3D would give me motion sickness end of the movie no problems.The BadThe villains suck. Megatron does absolutely nothing throughout the whole film until right at the end and even that was a let down. Shockwave appears briefly at the start and vanishes for two hours he himself doesn't actually do much it's all down to this big nameless tentacleclad decepticon he works with. Starscream does nothing but then he never did anything anyway. I'm not even going to mention Patrick Dempsey. But the biggest let down is with the movies main villain Sentinel Prime. Basically he is Optimus' predecessor but he changed sides to the decepticons and made a deal with Megatron to bring life back to their home planet Cybertron. This is the driving element of the movie but there are many plot holes from this. Early in the film Optimus basically says he wants to make Sentinel Prime leader of the autobots again and offers him the matrix an item that brings dead transformers back to life but Sentinel Prime declines. Then he changes sides. Why did he decline taking the matrix? it would in definitely be a help in his ploy. Sentinel Prime gets numerous chances to kill Optimus once and for all but like all lousy villains he delays his hand and Optimus lives.The productplacement is out of control. I am not joking when I say there is a scene where Shia LaBeouf stops the movie to recite a Mercerdes CommercialThe annoying characters from the last movie are gone save one. The little autobot who humped Megan Fox's leg makes a return. Just be thankful there's no Skids and MudflapThe DownRight UglyThe acting here is a range from Tolerable to ImpossiblyBad. There are actors here that have been in some high quality material that just blatantly signed onto this because A they wanted a paycheck B they have nothing else on their schedules I mean John Malkovich and Frances McDormand are Oscar nominees who are so unbelievably bad in this movie they make Shia Lebeouf look like Laurence Olivier and Rosie HuntingtonWhiteley is the stiffest most wooden actress i've seen in ages. John Turturro is awkward but after three movies I don't care anymore.Stereotypes ahoy not as prominent as before but it's here. We have Tyrese Gibson and some other black guy fistbump and ridicule one another. We have LeBeouf call a Japanese man MotoMushiIchi and decepticons with dreadlocks. Plus that gay guy from the hangover makes an appearance as some loony scientist but luckily Michael Bay had the sense to drop him out of a window.Some visceral American moments like using the moon landing to spark the movies plot. Also blowing up the statue of Lincoln to let Megatron sit on the chair instead. Since i'm British I didn't care for these scenes that are obviously meant to say to American audiences These decepticons are blowing up America! Damn Them!In Conclusion I may have some major complaints with this movie but it is a ton of fun. The movie delivers on everything it promises and everything you expect and not a single dull moment. If you loved the first movie and loved the second movie god help you I can guarantee you will love this movie even more. I'd say the definitive summer film this year has been made clear.So.. Viewing Audience.. Roll Out...";

The background music composed by Steve Jablonsky was fantastic and never so more appreciated during the car chase scene when they are tyring to protect Sentinel.People will criticise because it is a typical Hollywood block buster but if you want pure escapism then watch the film".

	schema:reviewBody "Witwicky The Movie! Once again Transformers is not focused to the Transformers but focused to a human being named Sam Witwicky. This is why I never liked Michael Bay's Transformers. This is why I already predicted Revenge of the Fallen will fail two years ago because the movie is not interested with Optimus. How can this series be called Transformers if it doesn't have enough Transformers? The Autobots only appear when there are Decepticons attacking and the preachy scenes about them. If there's no action there's the life of Witwicky. His life is never interesting but the film just wants us to show how important it is. How about less Witwicky and more Optimus? Would it make the film better? I guess so.Transformers movies never gets a good story. But we still watch these movies for the Autobots and the explosion and the loud noises. Fact The scenes of the Autobots only exist in the action scenes and the important scenes about them. The rest is all Witwicky and his chick and his uninteresting  unimportant life. There are new Transformers in this film but we never get to know them because it doesn't only have new Transformers it also have excessive cameos. These celebrity cameos has more screen time than the robot newbies.The special effects were the only merits of this trilogy. All the transforming all the robots all the explosions all the stuff jumping off the screen. Another Fact The 3D is DARKER of the Moon. We sure love the action and the explosion but the climax is focused to Sam Witwicky's survival again and the soldiers and Witwicky again and his new girlfriend and Witwicky then Patrick Dempseynot spoilers dude and Witwicky. It's all Witwicky! Yeah there's Optimus and Bumblebee but mostly focused to Witwicky and the humans.Saddest thing is the scenes of Bumblebee were also moderated. He is the only Autobot in the series we know the most and loved but here he is now like Optimus and the rest of the Transformers. Why can't they just call these films Sam and the Transformers or World Invasion Chicago and Egypt and LA and other places where the Transformies went? Sounds more credible than Transformers. I'm not really trolling Shia LaBeouf but him as Witwicky is like playing the same roles all over again. I bet he love Michael Bay for giving him these hot chicks. Rosie HuntingtonWhitely was only cast for her sexy body and giving Sam a backup. She doesn't improve Megan Fox's Mikaela Beans.Transformers is supposed to be about the Transformers. But it has more humans and Witwicky and Cameos and Witwicky. I think Michael Bay is getting lazy. He's not taking this movie so seriously and the movie ends too quickly and he throws a lot of humanity and celebrity cameos in his excessive runtime. By the way this movie is called Transformers not Human Celebrities. Well Bay made a grave mistake.".

What remains is the poor geeky humour and questionable performances from the leads. Shia Labeouf was very enjoyable in the first movie but here has gone into overdrive and his character Sam Witwicky has become much less relatable and interesting. His home life in particular of which the first half of the movie focuses is getting irritating. His girlfriend problems and embarrassing parents boring and we really couldn't care that much about how he feels unappreciated for saving the world twice. Then there's Megan Fox's replacement Rosie HuntingtonWhitely. She can't act. At all. It wasn't expected that the former model would be that great but she really is poor.The first hour of the film is much like Rosie. Nice to look at especially in 3D but lacking any substance at all. We are left with Ken Jeong doing his Hangover thing in a 12A film and not being funny just very annoying. And John Malkovich doing his thing but really just embarrassing himself. There are reams of exposition while the plot is better than the last two films it is still handed out poorly. Bay won't let the action tell the story it has to be action break story break action. The rest of the first hour is just CGI and Shia going mental while Rosie watches blankly.But all of a sudden the supporting comic actors are dropped and Michael Bay does what he does best Explosions and fighting. An impressive freeway chase leading into a fight a plot twist yes a plot twist in a Transformers movie and a death of a significant character. The whole film gets better from here. The plotting gets tighter John Tuturro and Frances McDormand are given more screentime there were so many Coen favourites in this movie I was expecting John Goodman to be voicing an Autobot and the action is dished out in spades. Whe the decepticons invade Chicago all hell breaks loose. And we are given fights battles explosions and collapsing buildings galore. Robots kick punch and rip each other apart. And this is where the third dimension comes into play. This is definitely the best 3D experience since Avatar. Watch in awe as Optimus Prime tears chunks of metal out of other giant robots and chucks them at the screen while in the depths of the background aerial battles ensue. It is breathtaking and a triumph for 3D proving that it can be done properly and amaze the viewer.If you went an hour late to the movie and make sure it's a 3D screening this would be a 5 star experience of pure entertainment.

The second was just trying to be too funny and the action was great but it was just chaotic. In Dark of the Moon Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg tuned down the comedy level and they put in a better structure for the action sequences. Now there were still a lot of great laughs and the special effects were at best they've ever been if not better. my only problems were that I believe that the characters could have been better developed but enough was done to get by and the way it was put together was just a tad bit messy but nothing too noticeable.

I wasn't a Michael Bay critic before seeing this film but now hate the man for ruining something I love.What's worse is this movie will be deemed a critical box office success based on all the poor people who pay to see it and go away feeling like I do.If I had wanted to watch a humans vs aliensrobots insert generic bad guy here then I would have watched one of those movies. No I payed to watch Transformers instead I got about 30 minutes in total scenes of Transformers  two hours plus of Michael Bay making American soldiers look cool and badass.Transformers have been fighting a war for centuries they are supposed to be hardened veterans instead they are used for comic relief  to make humans look cool with the ways they can kill some huge massively armoured and armed robots.The characters are all morons and Rosie HuntingtonWhiteley is the most annoying talentless person I have ever had to look at just seeing her face on the screen in 3D no less made me angry and cringe at the same time. Also they shouldn't have called it Transformers it should have been called Optimus Prime because he's pretty much all you are going to see the other Transformers are just thrown in as faceless voiceless filler characters. The 3D is also terrible and pointless I have seen several movies in 3D recently and it was totally under used and wasn't even consistent not being used throughout the movie and the movie was about an hour to long I prefer long movies but this one actually dragged along not going anywhere.Sadly I could keep coming up with things I hated about this movie  very little I liked about it this is the first time I have come away from a movie utterly disappointed  feeling ripped off. I went with my girlfriend  two friends she liked the first two movies but wasn't a Transformers fan  she didn't like this movie like me my two friends are life long fans  are utterly disgusted with the waste of space this film was. I am a very disgruntled fan who going into the movie ignored the negative comments and was very open about what I was going to see what I saw was utter disappointment.".

In this movie Megan Fox is no longer to be seen but we are gifted with a beautiful Rosie HuntingtonWhiteley playing along side Shia LaBeouf. This movie added some serious effects to it with the robots. just like the first two it combines an actionlovecomedy attribute. The action scenes in this movie are without a doubt awesome. The effects they used are amazing and to sort of let you catch up with whats happening they use slow motion to let you see things that are going on. I like how they've taken something that has actually happened like the moon landing and have put there own twist on what actually was happening. this was a very good movie and would recommend it to anyone interested in seeing robots you played with as kid come to life.".

Rebroadcasting of any of his films should be banned under the Geneva convention in fact the only difference between a Michael Bay film and Hitler's reign is that Bay's films will have a more profoundly negative impact on society.The film starts out just as any other Bay film with a pointless mix of thoughtless dialog and meaningless characters. Witwicky LaBeouf is out being the unimaginable world celebrity that he would be saving the world 2 times has no job and for some unbeknown reason is now in a relationship with a new love interest Carly last name is not apparent anywhere in the film. The character of Megan Fox is completely dismissed from the entire film with a single sentence despite it being the supposed focal point of the entire storytelling behind the first 2 films. Her blatant departure from the franchise is not even attempted to be cleverly masked and immediately gives you a bad feeling of what's to come. The fact that Michael Bay is comfortable with creating deep plot holes detached storytelling and single dimensional fill in characters over a petty feud with a mildly attractive wanabe actress speaks volumes about his creative and artistic merit however than itself is not even close to the overwhelming tripe that is Transformers 3 in its own respect. Soon it is revealed through a convoluted multigenerational web of increasingly ridiculous government coverups that there is an alien craft on the dark side of the moon. Somehow despite this craft being the single greatest discovery in human history it is revealed that single NASA accountant smudged cost figures to point where it was deemed infeasible to return to the lunar surface. Considering the potential benefits to the US government and much less the entire Human Race its unlikely that anyone not even the accountants in charge of giving Michael Bay 300 million to make this film could have convinced the government to stay away for 50 plus years. The next question of course is why. Why would an accountant want to keep humanity away from this extraterritorial discovery? Simple and something Michael Bay is very well rehearsed in  personal greed. Somehow or another the Decipticon's revealed themselves to this single person and convinced him that they would take over the entire world with or without his help this responsibility is then handed down to Dylan the son of the mystery architect of human destruction. By this point the film's true plot is revealed and the fight is on yet again. The Decipticons and Optimus Prime's superior sentinel prime have devised a plan to inhabit earth for themselves and use humans as slave to rebuilds their world. This seems somewhat pointless when they are the respective leaders of the two sides and a truce on their OWN planet would have made much more sense. However that doesn't even pale in contrast to the robot race and the absolutely comparatively pathetic strength of human engineering. This is akin to human's inhabiting an asteroid trillions of light years away over a war on earth and using ants as slaves to build their new homes.After the Autobots fake their extradition to gain an element of surprise they waste in the first 20 seconds of their return a single five by pointfive meter rod is controlling the transitioning of an entire alien solar system through an interdimensional gateway with absolutely no gravitational effects on earth. Its destruction is the sole focus of one and half hours of completely mind numbingly pointless action sequences and over the top special effects. The film ends with the same sappy sequence of unity and love in the face of horrific mass destruction of an entire city as the last 2 films and is exceedingly uninviting due to the previous 2 hours being nothing more than creative excuses to waste hundreds of millions of dollars on seriously injuring lowly paid extras poorly executing slow motion 3D hero sequences and lining Tyrese Gibson's pockets. All in all Transformers 3 is the worst film in the Trilogy and possibly the worst film ever created in its budget bracket. Michael Bay has spent too long inside his 500 million dollar Gulfstream 6 private jet to properly flesh out a movie plot or characters and has instead opted to blow sht up for almost 3 hours. This is a movie that will appeal to the same part of your brain that is activated by car accidents and terrorist attacks it will leave you shocked appalled and your trust and faith in humanity will be at an all time low once the soul crushingly horrible and inappropriate end credit music start rolling.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Transformers series recovers slightly after an horrendous second instalment with a decent final act providing of course that it is the final act.The story yep unlike No.2 this one has a story is that the autobots sent a ship out into the galaxy nearing the end of the Cybertronian War which crash landed on the Earth's moon. The Yanks found out about this which is why they were so eager to land there in the late sixties their real mission being to investigate this alien vessel. Turns out have the dormant former autobot leader Sentinel Prime voiced by Leonard Nimoy the voice of Galvatron in the original animated film on board and he has a cargo that could hand the Decepticons final victory in the Cybertronian war and grant them dominion throughout the universe.So the stakes are huge so is the budget. So are the nods to older characters. Uber badass Shockwave finally makes an appearance the autobots treating him with suitable fear and trembling. The rebel autobot Wreckers make an appearance though as particularly vulgar characters. The autobots have the odds stacked against them beaten and exiled and yet triumph in the end after much sacrifice.I won't say too much about the plot. Though there aren't many surprises you're better off seeing them in the film than reading them in this review.THis is easily the best characterisation of Optimus Prime and also Megatron in the film series. Sentinel is an excellent addition and I must admit to chuckling at the various Spock references throughout the film.So with the human actors. LeBeouf who I quite liked in the first and found tolerable in the second is here just annoying. We swap the brunette Barbie Doll Megan Fox for an actual Barbie Doll in Rosie Huntington Whitely. Though to compensate not being able to see Megan draped over a motor bike in short shorts we are shown a close up from behind of Rosie walking up a flight of stairs in her underwear. As a matter of fact that is her introductory scene which tells you all you need to know about her character. Frances McDormand and John Malkovich are both welcome additions and their characters both appear to have walked in off the same film John Turtorro's had in the first movie. Patrick Dempsey is perfect in his role as an oily business man conductor of mass enmity.Spike's parents were so funny in the first film and so vulgar in the second hear they have improved to being merely banal.Some of the set pieces are astonishing the highlight being some humans trapped in a sky scraper leaning on another sky scraper trying desperately to make their way across the fallen building into the still intact one as Shockwave tears the building apart but the whole battle sequence in Chicago is breathtaking. The ending is suitably dramatic and feels final.What can I say? Loved the transformer characterisations in this one. Had a couple of decent human characters added and actually had a story even if it was pretty thin. Better than the second not as good as the first. Loved it!".

As the new actress who plays Carly adds nothing to the film but like in most action movie you need a bit of eye candy and a female lead. The action is amazing in my eyes. And the script is not as bad as people make out. But i think it suits the film. People slate this film for all reasons. But is a classic in its own ways. It is just a good fun film. If you want you want a serious film go watch inception or the godfather. But if you let yourself get in to this film you will have a blast. I would say its one of the best films of 2011.".

	schema:reviewBody "The most successful British film of its original year 1959 and an equally successful release in the United States Carry On Nurse began as a play by Patrick Cargill and Jack Searle. Part of the appeal of this infectious comedy I assert lies in the complexity of the interwoven storylines which have been invented for it. Little wonder exists why it spawned so many imitations and a Carry On series that has lasted decades since this the first of the line. The film concerns very antiEstablishment attitudes by the male patients in a British hospital. Then there are the separate stories of the gentlemen trapped under Matron's tyrannical thumb each with his own visitor or visitors hopes complaints problems history purpose and timetable. Finally there are the nurses ranging in experience from the inept newcomers to the poised and competent senior staff members. A charming and sometimes surprising camaraderie or male bonding develops among the male patients and the interactions with the nurses range from pursuit to bickering with the nurses themselves interacting professionally with one another and also personally as human beings. The main storyline is hard to pin down but never hardtofollow. A reporter with appendicitis is wooing a pretty nurse a rising boxer has broken his hand during a successful bout a man with a large family worries about them a confirmed bachelor finds himself attracting a lovely young girl and a cantankerous Colonel irritates Matron and the entire staff etc. etc. The flavor of the film is very realistic which allows touches of bawdy humor wry commentary and dialogue byplay to develop out of the regimen that is stifling patients burdening nurses and making Matron grimly happy. The ward has rogues a dilettante who listens to music and conducts wearing 'headphones' malcontents and grumblers the friendly and the bored. The film was directed by Gerald Thomas from an adaptation of the original play done by Norman Hudis and Jack Beale. Cinematography was done by Reginald H. Wyer with art direction by Alex Vichinsky both contributing to a realistic style that becomes more than style alone. Joan Ellacott was in charge of costumes and original music was supplied by Bruce Mongomery. The entire cast were wellchosen for their parts. Terence Longdon as the reporter pursues Shirley Eaton Kenneth Connor is the boxer Charles Hawtrey Bill Owen Norman Rossington play other patients Hattie Jacques makes a wonderful Matron Leslie Phillips the rogue Joan Sims a ditsy young nurse Susan Stephen a delightfully downtoearth staff member. Wlfird HydeWhite is properly irritating as the fussy Colonel with Susan Shaw Irene Handly Jill Ireland Michael Medwin and Rosalind Knight taking other featured roles. The comedic highlight of the film is a surrealistic revolt by some of the patients high on 'laughing gas'. But all turns out well and this deservedly popular film whose humor ranges from classic dialogue subtlety to lavatory levels remains in the mind as a classic of its sortwhatever it islong after Matron has completed her rounds and discovered her nurses' revenge on the obnoxious Colonel which closes the frequentlyhilarious proceedings.".

Carry On Nurse was the second in the Carry On stream of British comedies that began with Carry On Sergeant and lasted for nearly 20 years. You'll either love 'em or you'll hate 'em. You'll love Carry On Nurse or at least feel a warm gentle glow of nostalgia break out over you like a rash if naughty humor based on bedpans buxom nurses buttock massages and bunions make you smile. We're in a hospital ward where the male patients are ruled by Matron and where almost every nurse is a knockout. Naturally they innocently cause acute adjustment problems for the men who are away from wives and girlfriends. The Carry On gang is represented here by Kenneth Connor as an anxious but wellmeaning boxer Kenneth Williams all intellectual condescension Terence Longdon the goodlooking observer Charles Hawtrey who made mincing about an art form Hattie Jacques as the ironwilled Matron and a number of others including a solo appearance by Wilfred HydeWhite as a demanding patient who winds up in the best joke of the movie. It involves that daffodil. Among the nurses is Shirley Eaton guaranteed to disturb any man's dreams. The story such as it is is even slighter than Carry On Sergeant. Carry On Nurse is really a series of episodic vignettes and jokes leading up to Hawtrey swishing about in a nurse's uniform Williams brandishing knives and preparing to remove a bunion while reading how to do it Connor administering the anesthetic which turns out to be laughing gas and poor Lesley Phillips who just wanted his bunion fixed so he could get on with a bit of snogging he'd arranged for the next day. The whole thing's a funny set up. By the grossout standards of today's movie humor Carry On Nurse is about as raunchy as Pollyanna. It's vulgar silly and a lot of fun. Just like the use that daffodil is put to.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Matron of Haven Hospital is a fearsome lady she runs a tight ship and the staff and patients are constantly walking on egg shells. After the admittance of a couple of lively characters the patients decide enough is enough and start to take things into their own hands.Following on from Carry On Sergeant this was the second entry into the Carry On franchise tho some of the humour is borderline bawdy it's still a long way short of what would become the franchise's trademarks.A number of character peccadilloes keep the film frothy and entertaining there is budding romances a hapless nurse annoying private patient and a whole ream of havoc inducing goingson. It's well adapted by Norman Hudis from the play Ring For Catty which was written by Patrick Cargill and Jack Searle and it's directed safely by Gerald Thomas. Who along with his producer Peter Rogers would bag themselves in the process a nice on going contract from Pinewood Studios.The film was a big box office success in Britain and even made a splash in America. It's not hard to see why consistently funny and charmingly simple Carry On Nurse is as safe as a Victorian built terrace house. Or should that be Hospital? 7.510".

After the admittance of a couple of lively characters the patients decide enough is enough and start to take things into their own hands.Following on from Carry On Sergeant this was the second entry into the Carry On franchise tho some of the humour is borderline bawdy it's still a long way short of what would become the franchise's trademarks.A number of character peccadilloes keep the film frothy and entertaining there is budding romances a hapless nurse annoying private patient and a whole ream of havoc inducing goingson. It's well adapted by Norman Hudis from the play Ring For Catty which was written by Patrick Cargill and Jack Searle and it's directed safely by Gerald Thomas. Who along with his producer Peter Rogers would bag themselves in the process a nice on going contract from Pinewood Studios.The film was a big box office success in Britain and even made a splash in America. It's not hard to see why consistently funny and charmingly simple Carry On Nurse is as safe as a Victorian built terrace house. Or should that be Hospital? 7.510";

	schema:reviewBody "In Haven Hospital an entire ward is made up of men ranging from the snooty Oliver Reckitt the distracted Hinton the gambling Colonel to the injured boxer Bernie Bishop. With nothing but men around young female nurses things could easily get out of hand but luckily the nurses are ruled by the Sister who in turn lives in fear of Matron who rules the hospital with an iron fist. However when discipline is so strict it is only a matter of time before the patients start to act out and rebel.This is one of the earliest Carry On films in the long running series and it stands out from Constable and Sergeant because it has a much more ensemble feel to it and more of a rambling narrative that works better than the serious story surrounded by sketches stuff that the others had tries at doing. In this regard it does seem to keep up a constant tone and is amusing even if it rarely made me actually laugh out loud. This is the problem with a lot of the earlier films in the series  they lack the wit and cheeky humour of the films made in the heyday of the series and thus feel quite stiff and perhaps almost dull at times. There are enough amusing moments here to make it worth seeing but two or three good laughs in 90 minutes is not really enough I'm afraid.The cast are the same from the first film with a few additions and yet still lacking some of the names that are synonymous with the series Sid James in particular. Connor is OK in a simple role Eaton is pretty to look at even if she has few laughs to her name Hawtrey seems to be in his own film but is fun regardless Phillips does his usual stuff but familiarity has not bred contempt in me and I enjoyed him HydeWhite is good value and has the famous final scene to himself while Joan Sims runs around a lot in the way she did in the early days. Owen is OK but the film is stolen by a typical but funny turn from Williams and the very famous Matron character as played by Jacques who suits the larger than life domineering character well.Overall this is not a great film and it has not dated well at all. It is amusing but yet rarely that funny  a problem when it seems to be trying to be wacky and outrageous at each step. Time has not treated it well and it is the structured but cheeky Carry On films that have lasted the best. Fans of the series may like it and the cast certainly make it worth a look but this is nothing that special and were it not part of this famous series I doubt it would be seen that often by many viewers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Carry On Nurse was the second in the long line of Carry On comedies that started in the late 1950s continued throughout the 1960s and ended in the late 1970s. After the surprise success of Carry On Sergeant in 1958 the team behind and in front of the film were brought back for what would be the most successful of all Carry On Films Carry On Nurse becoming the most successful film at the British Box Office in 1959 proving that laughter really is the best medicine with over 10.4 million tickets sold.Among the returning actors were Charles Hawtrey Kenneth Williams Kenneth Conner and Hattie Jacques while in supporting roles were Leslie Phillips Joan Hickson and Terence Longdon blonde bombshell Shirley Eaton also returned for her second of three Carry On Films while Carry On Queen Joan Sims made her Carry On Debut.The plot although thin is substantial enough to keep the film moving at a good pace and revolves around a mens ward with troublesome patients young nurses to send the men's temperatures up even higher doting visitors a betting orderly all under the watchful eye of a domineering matron. A reporter is sent to the ward with appendicitis while there he is persuaded to investigate the workings of a modern hospital this being 1959 it is very different to the health system of today but even back then it seemed our NHS was doomed if things were to run like as they do in Haven Hospital.The reporter Terence Longdon not content with just writing articles also finds time to fall in love with nurse Shirley Eaton this is prior to her turning gold for James Bond. Other patients on the ward included Mr Hinton Charles Hawtrey who seems to like nothing best than listening to the radio Oliver Reckitt Kenneth Williams an intellectual about to have his own study in love a colonel WilfridHydeWhite who being posh of course has a private room to himself where he likes to place bets eat biscuits and seems to think the nurses have nothing better to do than to dote on him hand and foot and also Bernie Bishop Kenneth Conner a boxer with an injured hand. When another patient Jack Bell Leslie Phillips arrives to have a bunion removed and his operation is postponed the wards drunken patients decide to remove the offending bump themselves. The comical ending involves the nurses getting their own back on the annoying colonel by taking his temperature in a most peculiar way. Carry On Nurse would be the first medical themed film in the series and as with other early entries in the series is more gentle than the later innuendo filled adventures of the Carry On gang and so for most of the film you would hardly recognise it as one and it is interesting to see the actors in a script that didn't require extra sauce saucy. Charles Hawtrey is forever the scene stealer Joan Sims makes the most of her clumsy character Kenneth William hams it up as the intellectual while Kenneth Conner gets a tougher than you might expect role but of course plays a boxer with heart and Hattie Jacques seems born for the role of uptight matron.Carry On Nurse is a healthy comedy and I would personally give it a healthy 810 its age may mean it's not for everyone's tastes but for those willing to watch a film in black and white oh just the thought of it! it's rewards grant an enjoyable hour and half with laughs along the way.".

A reporter is sent to the ward with appendicitis while there he is persuaded to investigate the workings of a modern hospital this being 1959 it is very different to the health system of today but even back then it seemed our NHS was doomed if things were to run like as they do in Haven Hospital.The reporter Terence Longdon not content with just writing articles also finds time to fall in love with nurse Shirley Eaton this is prior to her turning gold for James Bond. Other patients on the ward included Mr Hinton Charles Hawtrey who seems to like nothing best than listening to the radio Oliver Reckitt Kenneth Williams an intellectual about to have his own study in love a colonel WilfridHydeWhite who being posh of course has a private room to himself where he likes to place bets eat biscuits and seems to think the nurses have nothing better to do than to dote on him hand and foot and also Bernie Bishop Kenneth Conner a boxer with an injured hand. When another patient Jack Bell Leslie Phillips arrives to have a bunion removed and his operation is postponed the wards drunken patients decide to remove the offending bump themselves. The comical ending involves the nurses getting their own back on the annoying colonel by taking his temperature in a most peculiar way. Carry On Nurse would be the first medical themed film in the series and as with other early entries in the series is more gentle than the later innuendo filled adventures of the Carry On gang and so for most of the film you would hardly recognise it as one and it is interesting to see the actors in a script that didn't require extra sauce saucy. Charles Hawtrey is forever the scene stealer Joan Sims makes the most of her clumsy character Kenneth William hams it up as the intellectual while Kenneth Conner gets a tougher than you might expect role but of course plays a boxer with heart and Hattie Jacques seems born for the role of uptight matron.Carry On Nurse is a healthy comedy and I would personally give it a healthy 810 its age may mean it's not for everyone's tastes but for those willing to watch a film in black and white oh just the thought of it! it's rewards grant an enjoyable hour and half with laughs along the way.";

It isn't just the patients who are providing laughs accident prone Student Nurse Stella Dawson provides plenty too most notably when she gets her revenge on an awkward patient in a way that I'm surprised the 1959 censors allowed!This film was fun to watch although it didn't contain as many laugh out loud moments as some films in the series it did make me chuckle a few times. The cast did a decent job the regulars are clearly already comfortable in their roles. One or two of the jokes are a bit 'naughty' but are never as crude as those to be found in the later instalments of the series meaning it is probably okay for younger viewers to watch although some parents might disagree. Watching this it is clear that health care has changed a lot in the last fifty years no longer does Matron rule the ward with a rod of iron and patients certainly don't smoke in the hospital these days they stand outside the front door to do it!".

The film is mainly a series of small events of havoc where the men want to have some fun talk a few innuendos carry on whatever routines they have made for themselves and try to avoid trouble from the Matron Hattie Jacques oh and we see Student Nurse Stella Dawson Joan Sims and other staff working a little. Also starring Bill Owen as Percy 'Perc' Hickson and Susan Stephen as Nurse Georgie Axwell. Obviously this is very small location and doesn't get out and about like the later films it sticks more to small fry jokes involving bedpans food mime a great catchphrase and an attempted operation but it has its tiny giggles so it's not such a bad comedy.

	schema:reviewBody "From 1959 comes the second film in the famous Carry On series. Many of the personnel return from the earlier Carry On Sergeant now in a different setting but still poking fun at British traditions and authority.Some of the actors from the first film return in very similar roles Kenneth Williams as the intellectual Shirley Eaton as the glamorous love interest Hattie Jacques as an imperious authority figure and Charles Hawtrey as the wimpish man. Others are now playing different types of characters notably Kenneth Connor shedding his previous persona as a neurotic hypochondriac to portray a confident successful boxer. Bill Owen is no longer an establishment figure as in the first film and joins the ranks of the common men.Added to the mix are many new faces not least Joan Sims and Leslie Philips who will go on to become established stars of the film series. The big name guest star on this occasion is Wilfrid Hyde White.Like the earlier film there are many witty oneliners much of the humour suggestive rather than coarse and the story is littered with instances of authority constantly being undermined by ineptitude.Did I say story? Alas that is Carry On Nurse's big glaring weakness. The plot is virtually nonexistent. Whereas Carry On Sergeant unfolded with a clear sense of purpose and progression Carry On Nurse just lurches from one situation to another in a seemingly random manner. As with the earlier film there are two romances on the go but in this film they seem rather incidental. Kenneth Williams' connection with Jill Ireland surely one of the most unlikely romances in cinematic history just sort of happens and occurring so quickly without complication makes one wonder what the point of it was. More drawn out is Terence Longdon's pursuit of Shirley Eaton. There is a hint that there could be twists in store when Eaton is shown to be looking more longingly at Doctor Winn but this plot thread like many others is just discarded and forgotten about. Another is the idea that Longdon's reporter character is hired to observe hospital life whilst he is a patient there and write a report on it but again this idea never gets picked up again.It seems that whenever the film starts running out of steam a new character is introduced just to keep events ticking along. Having had one incompetent nurse in the form of Joan Sims we later get another one Rosalind Knight. Having had one smooth talking womanising patient in Terence Longdon halfway through the film we get another in the guise of Leslie Phillips.The only thrust of the plot in the first half of the film is that Matron mustn't be defied but we don't get too care too much because we don't see much by way of what happens when she is defied other than a nice brief essay on rank when Matron's stern rebuke of the Ward Sister is passed on in turn by the Sister to the staff nurse and so on until the student nurse gets the earbashing.Late on the film comes the most interesting phase when a drunken Williams is coerced into putting his money where his mouth is and performing an operation himself. This leads to the patients taking over an operating theatre and then unwittingly overdosing themselves with laughing gas. It is pure Carry On comedy but it only lasts about 15 minutes.Aside from the main plot is Wilfrid Hyde White's colonel in a private room. He likes gambling on horses and pestering the nurses but doesn't really contribute anything by way of laughs until the film's famous closing gag. White is given no interaction with most of the main cast at all and his inclusion seems completely superfluous.There are lots of good gags and good performances but with a shallow plot and consequently shallow characters the overall film is merely average. Writer Norman Hudis just fails to make the ideas work. To see how it should have been done watch Talbot Rothwell's later reworking of the same ideas in Carry On Doctor which is not only much funnier it has a much stronger storyline and characters the viewer will care more about.".

The movie has no particular plot it contains a series of situations and running jokes based upon the characters themselves and their various medical conditions. The playboy with a bunion the boxer with a fracture and so on. Campy Kenneth Williams plays an educated and rather snooty individual who thinks he can do anything. Reliable Hattie Jaques plays the role of matron with considerable panache. It's a fine mixture of medical humour sexual innuendo comedy of manners with some great sight gags and situation comedy in the classic British 1950's tradition. There isn't a bum role in the movie. The sequence in which the drunken patients commandeer an operating theatre to remove the playboy's bunion only to get additionally hammered by laughinggas is one of the funniest pieces of cinema. You can't help but laugh along with the likes of Kenneths Connor and Williams at full foghorn. It's rather a pity that the genre got 'hijacked' in the mid 1960's and subverted into the rather narrow appeal of exclusively toilet humour. Those of the late 1950's and early 1960's are definitely both the funniest and the wittiest. Even today 'Carry On Nurse' is great fun.It also serves to remind you how far standards of professionalism care and hygiene have slipped in the last halfcentury.Today you enter hospital at the risk of your life.".

Jill Ireland was married to David McCallum at the time but later got married to Charles Bronson. Kenneth Connor Kenneth Williams and a number of the other cast members were regulars in the series.";

	schema:reviewBody "I had already been a fan of Til Schweiger before seeing this film. I read about it that it did not receive the recognition it deserved. I had seen Til Schweiger in quite a few other films and I was interested to see his ability to perform in a drama setting. We had seen a bit of this in the film Driven in 2001 and his performance was outstanding. He stole the show with his ability to become his character. But I noticed that when he doesn't say anything he is still able to convey what is going on in the scene with just his emotions. Not many actorsactresses have mastered this ability and this is part of the appeal of watching him on screen.This movie had both funny awkward and dramatic moments that it all dealt with extremely well. I would recommend this film even to people who do not like reading subtitles. But part of the beauty of watching a film in another language is leaving it in it's intended language as many scenes can be lost in translation. If you pay close attention to body language and the emotions involve it's easy to perceive what is lost in translation.My rating of this film I would gladly pay to see it more than once and I intend to buy it on DVD. To my surprise it was not available on stream and the previous film from 2007 is not available either. This is very discouraging but if you buy it or rent it somewhere you will not be disappointed.This wasn't my first film to watch in German and read subtitles. It won't be the last. The German film industry needs more recognition and that's surprising to come from an American born and raised. But it's true and German films are worth every penny. It kind of makes me want to learn the language and experience the beauty of their culture after watching this movie. I hope someone else enjoys this film as much as I did.Thanks to Til Schweiger for writing directing and acting this great piece of modern day masterpiece. Please continue to make great things and do good. We love your work and you as a very talented individual.".

	schema:reviewBody "Til Schweiger's Keinohrhasen was a massive commercial success in Germany so of course id did not take too long till they came up with a second movie. The central characters are just like in the first Til Schweiger Matthias Schweighfer and Nora Tschirner.I thought the film started very weak with humor on great breast size and farting in people's faces but as it went on it got better. It never reached the level of the first movie but all in all it's a decent outcome. There is some malefemale discussion about shoes which reminded me of Loriot the way it was written. In the first film Jrgen Vogel played himself in a cameo and here in this movie Heiner Lauterbach and Uwe Ochsenknecht two of Germany's most known actors over 55 play small but funny roles.While the first film was about Schweiger's and Tschirner's characters getting together this film is about struggles they are facing during everyday life especially as former partners of them enter the picture. Then there is a subplot with Schweighfer's character which walked the fine line between funny and cringeworthy and occasionally even crossed it for worse. The ending of this 2hourfilm was one of its weaknesses in my opinion. First of all the fact that they sleep with their exes at exactly the same time felt weird to me and the harmonic ending seemed just rushed in and included for the sake of it. It was extremely cheesy.There is lots of music in this one but the only kinda memorable song for me was This Is The Life by Amy McDonald. It was not as successful as the first but still became the 6th most lucrative film at the box office in 2009 and number 2 if you only count German films. As a whole I recommend Zweiohrkken chicken with two ears to people who enjoyed Keinohrhasen rabbits with no ears. Just like its prequel it was written and directed by Anika Decker who has the same name like the central character and Schweiger himself who also directed it again. We'll see if they ever make a third one. If they do i just hope the decrease in quality won't continue. The only thing better than the first is that Alwara Hfels one of the biggest weaknesses of Keinohrhasen is pretty much nonexistent in this sequel.".

	schema:headline " My take on what happened between the two movies...";
	schema:reviewBody "Some have wondered why the Cleveland Indians are not even mentioned in the third installment of the Major League series. Here's why plus my notes on this movie 1 Between 1994 and 1998 when this movie was released the real Cleveland Indians made the playoffs every year and went to the World Series twice. There's no fun and really no point in making a movie about underdogs when the reallife team is one of the best in baseball. This is why the producers did not focus on the Tribe but partially on the thenhapless Minnesota Twins. The only scene where you even see a reference to the Indians is in a Sporting News article Gus is reading while riding the bus describing the Tribe as contenders.a side note I've been a diehard Indians fan for 30 years so I may sound a bit prejudiced here 2 I wish we would have known whether the Tribe won the World Series after Major League 2 ended. My guess is no because I think it would have been mentioned if the Tribe had come out on top. None of the principals Pedro Rube or even Dorn sport rings in this movie but even the pennant winners get smaller rings I've seen the ones the Tribe received for winning the AL pennant in 1995 and 1997...they are very nice indeed.3 We know that Pedro left baseball and came back now seeking Christianity apparently with some voodoo mixed in since a ragged looking Jobu makes a cameo here. Dennis Haysbert who played Pedro Cerrano in all three movies could win five Oscars and be hailed as the greatest actor ever and to me he will ALWAYS be Pedro Cerrano.4 It is mentioned that Rube Baker Eric Bruskotter who to me will also be one of Ronald's friends from Can't Buy Me Love who had a home run and an important double in the ALCS in MLII had been playing with the San Diego Padres before being released. This indicates that the Indians finally got fed up with his throwing problems and invested in a real catcher.5 Wild Thing and Jake Taylor are nowhere to be seen. My guess is that Ricky Vaughn would have still been with the Tribe with Jake Taylor as the Indians' manager. They did win a pennant after all.6 Gus Cantrell Scott Bakula must have played with some of these players in the Tribe's minor league system at one time. That's how Pedro Rube and Dorn know who he is.7 Roger Dorn Corbin Bernsen recovered from having to sell the Tribe in MLII resurfacing as the owner of the sadsack Twins. His character is much more mature and likable here. I couldn't stand Dorn in the first two movies.8 Harry Doyle's Bob Uecker drinking problem finally caught up with him and forced him out of the Indians' broadcast booth probably after cursing the Tribe out for losing the World Series. He tells Gus on the bus after they pull up to the Metrodome that it had been a while and what a year to quit drinking. It seems that Doyle had finally licked his alcoholism.9 Tanaka apparently took his World Series share and opened that mini golf course you see in the movie. Don't forget he was a veteran of Japanese baseball when the second one came out and his part was mostly played for laughs. In 1994 the only player of Japanese origin in the bigs was Hideo Nomo. Now with Ichiro and others becoming stars it's almost commonplace. Even the Tribe has Kaz Tadano a pretty fair relief pitcher in their system.10 Finally this movie is better than the second one. It's not as good as the first one but MLI oozes so many curses and obscenities that I wouldn't let my kids watch it if I had any. The second one is much cleaner but halfway through seeing it the first time I knew it was a bad movie even though seeing my beloved Cleveland Indians win the pennant on celluloid covers a multitude of sins. This one is a good Sunday afternoon time waster. It's not that bad.".

It's a movie that wants nothing more than to make you laugh and it does a great job at that. Scott Bakula as always is good and Ted McGinley is appropriately weasley as the coach of the opposing team. I won't give it away but the scene involving McGinely a baseball and the wall of the dugout is one of the funniest gags in the entire movie that had me laughing long after the scene had ended. Bob Ueker who was hysterical in MAJOR LEAGUE and MAJOR LEAGUE II gets a little stale this time around but still gets in some funny moments. If only the lovely Jensen Daggett had been given a bit more to do. But the film is funny and worth a look if you're in the mood for a fun movie the whole family can enjoy.".

I found it to be a very entertaining movie. What killed it dead was the decision to make it part of the Major League franchise.This movie could have easily stood on its own two feet as just another great baseball movie. Instead in a bid to tie it in with the two movies that came before we have a movie that just tries too hard to live up to a reputation that had already been destroyed by Major League 2.With the exception of 3 or 4 cast members most of the original actors did not return for this outing and what we're left with is a contrived plot for the actors that did just to tie this in with the franchise.Roger Dorn Corbin Bernsen now completely retired from playing is now the owner of the Minnesota Twins and all the affiliated feeder clubs associated with them. He hires his old teammate and washed up pitcher Gus Cantrell Scott Bakula to manage his AAA team The South Carolina Buzz who like in the 1st movie are a bunch of no talent misfits until Cantrell licks them in to shape. Already with the Buzz are Rube Baker Eric Bruskotter who is later joined by old Indian's Teammate Pedro Cerrano Dennis Haysbert. Just to give that very much unneeded link to the past.On a visit to see Roger Gus is reunited with another old team mate of his the vain and extremely arrogant Leonard Huff  Ted McGinley. It is evident that these two men detest one another and have done for years. Huff is always ready to belittle Gus regarding what he perceives as his failed career and his minor league status and Gus despising Huff's brutal and arrogant style of baseball management.More out of rivalry than for entertainment an Exhibition match is set up for the Buzz to play the Twins at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome Sadly now demolished. Realising the Buzz are on the verge of winning Huff fakes a power cut to try to save some face.However the press have latched on to the rivalry and tension between Gus and Huff and require a definitive winner to the grudge match and both sets of players are merely pawns in a private war between the two managers. Only this time Gus insists that the Twins play at their ballpark.ML3 is a really entertaining movie ruined by a desire to shape it in to something it didn't need to be. Whilst I won't begrudge any actor their pay cheque The Roger Dorn character didn't need to be Roger Dorn Cerrano didn't need to be Cerrano and no character from the previous 2 movies needed to be revived for this to be a good film. In fact it would have been better had they not done this at all.However one character that did return that I was genuinely glad to see was the brilliant Bob Uecker reprising his role of wisecracking sportscaster Harry Doyle. Most of the movie's belly laughs come from his droll commentary and his rivalry with his stuffed shirt Minnesota counterpart.One annoying aspect of the movie is the annoying Guitar riff that's played every time a cast member utters the name of the Twin's star player and resident psychopath Carlos Liston played well by Lobo Sebastian.Bakula is really good here and so is McGinley. McGinley is often given a lot of stick by some for overplaying his characters. His character here is worthy of some overplay as he should be a figure of dislike and ridicule and McGinley made the character of Leonard Huff exactly as he should be.For the guys Jensen Daggett plays Bakula's love interest and very pleasing on the eye she is too and it's a shame she hasn't done a great deal since.A great little movie but sadly one only created to sit in the shadow of it's big brothers. However sometimes even the runt of the litter can stand up for itself.Enjoy!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I think of Major League Back to the Minors is a pretty good spin off of the first two Major League movies. Writerdirector John Warren has put together a film that has the same feel as the first two. He has also done a good job of having some familiar faces as well as introducing us to some new ones.In the beginning we are introduced to Gus Cantrell played by Scott Bakula. Gus is a professional baseball pitcher who has spent a lot of time in the minor leagues. Gus knows that he is too old to be playing professional baseball. That is when Roger Dorn played by Corbin Bernsen reprising his role from the first two films comes along with a job offer. Roger offers Gus the job to be the manager of his AAA team the Buzz. It is up to Gus to turn this group of guys into a legitimate baseball team.With this Buzz baseball team we have an interesting group of players. We have a bunch of new faces. One of them is Hog Ellis a pitcher who only has a fastball in his repertoire. Carlton Doc Windgate is a starting pitcher who is good at locating and controlling his pitches but has the slowest fastball in all of professional baseball. Frank Pops Morgan has been playing minor league ball for two decades and never made it to the majors. Twin brothers named Juan Lopez play second base and shortstop. Lance Pere is a third baseman who was once a ballet dancer. Finally we have Billy Downtown Anderson as a young upandcoming hitter who needs some fine tuning.Along with the new faces we have some familiar ones. Rube Baker who was an Indians catcher in the second Major League film is back as the Buzz catcher. Voodoo man Pedro Cerrano is back to help Gus make the Buzz a good team. Along with Cerrano is his crazy Japanese buddy Taka Tanaka.The story focuses on one season where at first the Buzz is the joke of all AAA teams. But under Gus's coaching they become a team good enough to compete with its major affiliate the Minnesota Twins.I think the story and film are fun and entertaining especially if you are a fan of the first two Major League films or even just baseball at all. The only thing I still can't get my mind past is how is it possible for both the Buzz and the Twins to find time out of their seasons to play against each other.".

Yeah we can make an unnecessary sequel! That my friends is quite possibly how Major League Back to the Minors got made. Or was it the fact that around the time this film was made the Cleveland Indians were winning and making a film about a group of misfit underdogs on the same team that is really doing well in real life would be a curse? Regardless it should've been left alone. Now we got a nice nearly unrelated sequel leaching off of the Major League.David S. Ward director of both previous films as been docked down to co writer of this mess. Something told me that even he wasn't fully on board with this film. Back to the Minors turns the tables from the Indians to the Minnesota Twins the team Roger Dorn Bernsen now owns. The film focuses on Gus Cantrell Bakula a minor league pitcher for a team called the Fort Myers Miracle.Roger offers Gus a job coaching the Twins' minor league affiliate the South Carolina Buzz. Two of the members from the Cleveland Indians team return. Those are Pedro Cerrano Haysbert and Taka Tanaka Takaaki Ishibashi. Wonderful because I wasn't too big of a fan of Cerrano and couldn't stand Tanaka.When you can't get the two leads who made a film what it was don't make a sequel to a film without them. Don't think a crappy spin off is treating the fans to something special. It isn't.Thank the lord Bob Uecker reprises his role as the alcoholic Indians announcer. But this time he is announcing the Buzz? The film doesn't even provide an answer to why Cerrano Tanaka and the announcer are now with the Buzz. They all looked great last season why did the Indians trade them? Is Jake Taylor still the manager of the Indians? Did the team trade Wild Thing? Did they win the World Series? The film doesn't provide the answer to questions fans are asking.Major League Back to the Minors is now the big wart on the entire franchise. There never needed to be a third film. The idea should've been scrapped when Berenger and Sheen said they wouldn't return. But of course the money is what matters. Not even James Gammon comes back as a cameo. This film is one of the most tasteless and lackadaisical sequels I've ever seen.Though it was this film that made me realize Corbin Bernsen Roger Dorn in the film would later go on to play the father in I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus my favorite holiday film. It was good for that.Starring Scott Bakula Corbin Bernsen Dennis Haysbert Ted McGinley Takaaki Ishibashi and Bob Uecker. Directed by John Warren.".

BTTM is a great baseball movie for sitting back with some popcorn and having a laugh. It's a bit like The Sandlot except geared more towards adults in terms of storyline and humor. That's not to say kids can't watch it. There isn't a ton of swearing one or two words and nothing over the top sexually unless you count a woman wearing a nice bathrobe. I'm perfectly fine with letting my 9yr old baseball playing son see it but some of the story might be a bit over his head.The movie has lots of uniquememorable characters a solid underdog storyline and lots of humor sprinkled throughout. The humor is largely visual gags and some verbal word play. It's light on meanspirited and crass humor. This was something that I found less than appealing about the original from what I recall it was over a decade ago at this point it seemed to rely more on that sort of humor which I'm not a huge fan of in those kinds of doses and would certainly not let my son watch at this age. Good movie for former baseball and fastpitch softball players who may be reminded of former coaches both good and bad and crazy teammates. Might even be a good family movie for parents with slightly older children but you'd want to view it first to make certain it's a good fit for you.".

It just makes sense to have an original character as the lead. I also didn't find Walton Goggins that believable as the new young prospect. He's not that young looking and he needs more muscle to be a big hitter. And losing the Cleveland Indians doesn't help although that may be beyond the filmmakers' control. That's not a rub against The Twins. It's just that the franchise started with the Indians and there's a history.".

He has a great approach to managing his team. The roping of the two Juan's together to shorten their range so each covers the appropriate range for their respective positions is priceless. He turns Downtown in to a complete hitter after he returns from his shot at the majors where he couldn't hit any thing but a fastball. Pops Morgan is a pretty much washed up player who just can't let go of the dream. I like it when they find Tanaka at a miniputt putt golf course with his family. He is convinced to return to pro ball. Dennis Haysbert returns for the third time as Pedro Cerrano the power hitting but superstitious player. Corbin Benson is back as the smarmy owner of a major league team that plays the minor one on a dare. I like the face down between Liston and the pitcher. This results from a little talk that Bakula had with him about the mechanics of pitching. Ted McGinley plays the manager of ther Twins and he just can't understand why they get beat. This is a decent follow up movie for the series.".

Scott Bakula gave a sunny performance in a film that was otherwise cloudy at times and utterly rediculous.  I'm not saying that it's Oscar calliber material neither are the other Major League filmswhen you think about it screwball comedies will never receive that kind of appreciation but it's funny.

Another great scenewhen Gus and the Twins coach are shaking hands before the game starts and Gus tells him My team says you were a toupee and the Twins manager replies angrily I DON'T WEAR A TOUPEE! and messes his hair up.

It consists of a sequence where an infuriated coach throws a baseball hard into the wall behind him only to have it hit the cement and bounce back and smash him in the face. It's not much but with the exception of a few oneliners it's all this film has to offer...enough said. This movie is not only structurally impaired characteristically undeveloped predictable and badly written but also just plain bad. Even noncritical audience members will hate this movie with all that they got. It is so familiar it just isn't funny.  How many times does the same movie about sports have to be made?  Last years we saw this same material in Air Bud Golden Receiver and as bad as that film was this is even worse. At least Air Bud was family oriented. Major League Back to the Minors is too vulgar for a wholesome family to view together on a Sunday afternoon. It is too childish for adults. So who is this film for? Teenagers? Elderly? People who are so desperate for entertainment they would rent something like this?The film like many others like this has one basic point it tries to make teamwork conquers all. Yes it does and what a great moral to try to prove. Too bad we have already seen and excepted it so many times over and over have such little talent and intelligence that their cheerleaders are men in a ballerina costumes. Where the silly announcers form their own buddy comedy routine muttering one liners to themselves like They suck This kids fast ball is timed with an hour glass This guy dropped out of ball for a while to find something he lostmaybe it was his mind Somebody needs a nap and ever see a sunset as beautiful as that play. Where the characters have such little significance to each other that we never know them by name. And where the only heartfelt lecture scene about teamwork is so unknowledgeable that it is almost funny.Major League Back to the minors is so bad it stalls its trite ending right in the middle of a good closing sequence. The good baseball team is on a comeback they are about to win andthe power goes out. I was thinking for a minute that this piece of trash had come to a conclusion but in reality its false final scene exists only to add minutes to the running time. The movie basically consists of a series of unrelated sketches that throw in so many putrid jokes it is are not funny. There is another kindoffunny line of dialogue that has a coach and a player talking to each other about why a long time outfielder is not wanted in that position any longer. The coach's answer You're too old too slow and too fat. The player's reaction is to die for. But that scene certainly does not make this movie noteworthy of you time and certainly is not worth a cent of your money. So here is another dreadful entre into this genre of film another that is doomed with its own script which is failed before seen and another which is so familiar it seems like deja vu all over again.".

Unlike his previous relationships Alvy believed he may have worked out all the issues in his life through fifteen years of therapy to make this relationship with Annie last among those issues being not wanting to date any woman that would want to date him and thus subconsciously pushing those women away. Alvy not only reviews the many ups and many downs of their relationship but also reviews the many facets of his makeup that led to him starting to date Annie. Those facets include growing up next to Coney Island in Brooklyn being attracted to the opposite sex for as long as he can remember and enduring years of Jewish guilt with his constantly arguing parents.";

Directed and cowritten by Woody Allen who has since directed other gems such as Hannah and Her Sisters and The Purple Rose of Cairo Annie Hall also stars Allen as Alvy Singer a neurotic deathobsessed comedian who seems unlucky in love and life.  That is until he meets Annie brilliantly played by Diane Keaton who is beautiful fashionsavvy carefree she likes using expressions like la di da' and a terrible driver.Annie and Alvy's relationship is an unlikely one.  She's a Midwestern girl straight out of whitebread Wisconsin he's a lifelong New York Jew who grew up literally under the Coney Island roller coaster.  He's been seeing a therapist for the past 16 years she only needs' one once she meets him. She's an extroverted aspiring singer he's an introverted worlddespising imp.  Yet Allen and Keaton are so perfect in their roles they improbably make this couple one of the most memorable ever.The plot revolves around Alvy's chronicles of loves lost and a retrospective on his relationship with Annie with whom he has since parted ways.  At the end of the film we see Alvy try his hand at stagewritinghe writes a play about his relationship with Annie but gives it a happy ending.  Yes Annie and Alvy don't have a fairy tale ending to their relationship but Alvy certainly wishes they had even though he learns to live with the acknowledgment it has failed.The best part of Annie Hall is its incredible screenplaythe best ever to be written.  Not a word is wasted nor a line unquotable.  Except here while Allen's early films had thrived on streams of oneliners Allen doesn't go for cheap laughseach line is simultaneously hilarious and poignant. Everything is part of a greater whole.  We laugh because it's funny but there's a greater dynamic at work in Annie Hall.  This is a story not exclusively about a relationship between two people but also a musing on 70's politics drugs East CoastWest Coast rivalry narcissism religion celebrity and several other topics with which Allen deals with extraordinary ease.Yet Annie Hall would not be among my favorite films of alltime if it were just Woody Allen ranting and raving about what he likes and dislikes. There are other Allen films that serve that purpose i.e. Deconstructing Harry and they're not nearly as good.  What separates Annie Hall is its grace the believable chemistry between Keaton and Allen the unique direction ranging from splitscreens to cartoon imagery to onscreen subtitles of what the actors are thinking but mostly because it's the rare film to find a perfect balance between sheer entertainment humor and poignancy.When the dust had settled Diane Keaton deservedly won an Academy Award for her performance Allen took home Oscars for direction and writing and the film beat out Star Wars for Best Picture which most people consider a complete sham.  Evidently those people didn't see Annie Hall for if they had they'd recognize that the acting writing and even the direction in Star Wars can't hold a candle to Annie Hall one of the best films ever made.1010".

It was because of this film that I fell in love with Woody Allen at the age of twelve take your cheap shot here and almost twenty years later he still is that intellectual bookish and humorous ideal.  Diane Keaton was his muse and costar for this film and they are perfect counterparts  so much so that their interaction onscreen doesn't seem like viewing two actors in a film but is a much more voyeuristic experience.  Watching Annie Hall' is like sitting at a bistro table and observing another couple a few tables away and that is just one of the elements that make this film so endearing. Most people can relate to at least some aspects of Alvy and Annie's relationship which helps make this film a timeless one. However Annie Hall' is not just a good romantic comedy it is a film that engages some unusual storytelling techniques.  Actors speak directly to the audience characters interact with strangers on the street who just happen to know the answers to the personal questions posed there is a brief animation scene etc.  While none of these approaches were new in 1977 their execution was inspired.  Annie Hall' is like a fond memory or a favorite old song  anytime I have discussed this film with others their smiling expressions are usually tinged with a hint of nostalgia because one can look back on either their past or current relationship and do what precious few films allow us to do  relate on a personal level.Shelly".

Allen wisely deconstructed the genre with his nonlinear storyline something that was later done to even greater effect with a more recent and profound look at relationships Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and charming little theatrical tricks like talking to the audience or pulling extras into the scene for their opinions on what's been going on. It keeps the viewer off guard and allows for a free flow of comedic and philosophical ideas that might otherwise not have found their way into a more traditional film.In his latter years Allen's best work has been when he is not part of the cast my personal favorites being Bulletts over Broadway Sweet and Lowdown and the recent Match Point. Annie Hall was made in his heyday when he could still pull off playing a neurotic New York Jewish comedienne with charm and panache. There's something innocent and benign about his obsessions here as this was long before the WoodySoonYi fiasco and the days of grossly miscasting himself against younger female costars.

This is not the kind of story that Hollywood likes to tell and it's quite admirable that Allen was able to not only get away with it but to walk away with the major awards as well as give then girlfriend Diane Keaton her own Best Actress award because this being such an intellectual film and not one where the actors all look glamorous it broke new grounds for a novel way of presenting a film.Groundbreaking is the definite term here.

	schema:reviewBody "Alvy Singer Woody Allen is something of a hopeless romantic. A cynical deathobsessed New York Jewish comedian Singer has never been able to maintain a steady relationship with a woman. He has been married twice and divorced twice. He broke up with one woman because of their disagreements over the second shooter conspiracy of John F. Kennedy's assassination or perhaps that was just his excuse. To paraphrase Freud possibly Groucho Marx he simply would never want to belong to any club that would accept someone like him for a member.

In an uncharacteristic move for the Academy Allen's film won four 1978 Oscars including Best Actress Keaton Best Original Screenplay Allen Marshall Brickman Best Director Allen and Best Picture  not undeservedly though millions of 'Star Wars' fans would I'm sure disagree. Having revisited 'Annie Hall' for the first time in a year having since enjoyed many of Allen's other films I am genuinely amazed at his transition from silly comedian to insightful observer on human relationships. Of course a noticeable evolution in his filmmaking style is evident in both the sciencefiction 'Sleeper 1973' and the Russian historical spoof 'Love and Death 1975' but neither boasts the the intelligence nor the sophistication of this film which wholly discards the Chaplinlike slapstick of Allen's previous films and adopts the TracyHepburn screwball comedy of a decade later.Originally slated  and filmed in fact  as a New York murder mystery with a romantic subplot 'Annie Hall' was taken by editor Ralph Rosenbaum and cut down massacred if you will into the modern witty 1970s screwball comedy that we still enjoy today. It is truly amazing that such an extensive postproduction reshaping had no obvious ill effects upon the general flow of the film though the structure in itself is so hectic that we probably wouldn't notice it anyway Allen frequently cuts forwards and backwards in time his modern characters are able to revisit and discuss the past characters in split screens interact Allen regularly breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience directly. Some of the discarded murder mystery elements from 'Annie Hall' were later incorporated into another Allen film 'Manhattan Murder Mystery 1993' which also costarred Keaton.Aside from Allen and Keaton numerous smaller roles provide a crucial framework for the overall structure of the film. Tony Roberts is Rob Singer's old friend and confidant. Paul Simon of Simon and Garfunkel plays a record producer who takes a keen interest in both Annie and her singing.

I forgot my mantra and Sigourney Weaver who can be briefly glimpsed as Singer's date outside a theatre. Two slightly more unusual cameos come from Truman Capote as a Truman Capotelookalike no less and scholar Marshall McLuhan whom Singer suddenly procures from behind a movie poster to declare to a talkative filmgoer that you know nothing of my work!.Easily the most innovative and energetic of the films I've so far seen from Woody Allen 'Annie Hall' is a spirited glimpse at the incompatibility of human beings and a cynical yet bittersweet meditation on the falsity of the perfect romantic Hollywood ending. It is also a considerable comedic achievement and Allen would repeatedly recycle his trademark neurotic New Yorker screen persona most notably in 'Manhattan 1979' but never with more success than this premium outing in excellence. The engaginglyconvoluted storyline moves with such briskness that you don't realise just how very little happens and that by the film's end our characters are exactly where they were at the beginning.

A cynical deathobsessed New York Jewish comedian Singer has never been able to maintain a steady relationship with a woman. He has been married twice and divorced twice. He broke up with one woman because of their disagreements over the second shooter conspiracy of John F. Kennedy's assassination or perhaps that was just his excuse. To paraphrase Freud possibly Groucho Marx he simply would never want to belong to any club that would accept someone like him for a member.

Allen also breaks the fourth wall a lot and has many dream sequences and asides which add to the complexity of the characters.  This is a highly autobiographical film and Allen pulls no punches.  This movie is not about romance in the way that Breakfast at Tiffany's is.  Rather Annie Hall is a deconstruction of a romance.  At times it is funny and heartbreaking and always classic.

In a much studied decision they decided to cut out all the mystery and just focus on the context. In this case that context is a richly layered evocation of a relationship. I really wish I could see the original film to discover the mysteries Woody intended to hide in the folds.And the folds are as numerous and complex as they can get. We have a framing device where Woody speaks to us partly as a conversation which blends into a standup which is mirrored as a part of the story. We have timeshifting where we move back and forth in time in a simple 'Tarantino' way but we go way past characters from the 'present' enter the past as Dickensian ghosts then they talk to characters in the past. we have characters in different pasts talking to each other via split screen. We have a layering of Woody and Diane's relationship in real life then the film then TWO films within a play which is part of the action and a cartoon which is the action itself.More we have Woody talking to the audience as if we were shifted into the play  early in that play we are introduced to Bergman and Fellini in both cases while they are waiting outside. These are the two inventors of folded narrative. Even more while some bozo perfessor spouts off about Fellini and McLuhan Woody enlists the audience to challenge him and drags out McLuhan himself!

Watch her.. she is clued in to simultaneously being in herself Keaton herself Hall inside the story she is telling and inside the story Woody is telling.

	schema:reviewBody "Annie Hall shows us the love story between Alvy Singer Woody Allen and Annie Hall Diane Keaton. We watch Alvy as he matures and moves through several relationships set against the true love of his life Annie Hall.Alvy helps Annie grow and come out of her shell as evinced by the growth of Annies blossoming singing career. Even the songs are a metaphor for their relationship. Her first song It had to be you when their relationship starts. Later she sings in a mature sultry voice Seems like old times. Set against snapshots of their romance.Keep your eye out for these young actors Christopher Walken preDeer Hunter as Annie's psycho brother I dream of turning the wheel into the on coming lights. Alvy interrupts him I have to get back to the planet earth. Jeff Goldblum preBig Chill Jurassic Park The Fly In Tony Lacey's house calling his guru I forgot my mantra. Paul Simon as Tony Lacey a Californian music star. Carol Kane as Alvy's first wife whose relationship is influenced by Alvy's obsession with JFK's assassination conspiracy theories. Colleen Dewhurst Annie's WASP mother talking through the split screen to Alvy's mother. See if you can spot Sigourney Weaver as Alvy's date standing in front of the movie theater when Alvy meets Annie in NY at the end of the movie. Watch Gary Mule Deer in full afro when Alvy meets Annie in California. Now Gary tours with Johnny Mathis. Shelly Duvall as the transcendent Rolling Stone reporter. In a few years she will become Olive Oyl then Wendy of the famous Here's Johnny scene from the shining. My how this movie hasn't aged at all. And that really is Truman Capote walking through the park when Alvy says And this guy gets the Truman Capote lookalike award. You have got to like Tony Robbins a square jawed ladies man in many of Woody Allen's movies Radio Days A midsummer nights sex comedy Play it again Sam. You don't mind seeing Robbins type cast because you instantly know that he is going to be the perfect opposite of Allen's angst filled Alvy.Another Woody Allen directing feature that I happen to like is his use of the split screen and the fixed screen. In both the camera doesn't move thereby forcing you to get involved in the dialogue. These techniques work because Woody Allen has strong tight dialogue and truly dramatic actors.Many of the scenes from the late 70's and early 80's are wonderful to watch because they reflect the matter of fact mores and fads of the time Snorting cocaine was cool the veggieburgertofu California scene the liberal Columbia college satire.Listen carefully to the background chatter during the California scene at Tony Lacey's house with swinging' hip background music. Hysterical lines that you can use in your office today Right now it is only a notion but I think I can get the money to make it into a concept then later turn it into an idea. Woody Allen has satirized and captured the language and mind set of the entire moviemusic industries. A memorable scene is when Alvy pulls Marshall McLuhan out from behind a movie placard to refute some bombastic guy pontificating about McLuhan's poetry. You wish you could do the same.Truly a great movie that ages well and has a sweet message about romance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay Woody Allen could be annoying sometimes and is heavily neurotic even in this film which he wrote and directed. The film is somewhat autobiographical about his relationships with a WASP woman named Annie Hall played by Diane Keaton in her Oscar winning role. Woody plays himself in the film even with a different name. Even though it's a short film the story moves quickly and you have to be alert for some of the humor about the relationship between men and women. The supporting cast includes Tony Roberts Paul Simon Carol Kane and others. Woody's hatred of Los Angeles and all things Californian is wellknown and documented. He is out of touch when he is away from New York City where he is equally neurotic. As a couple at first Woody and Annie get along great but slowly Woody's own negativity creeps into the relationship. Annie starts seeing a therapist and their relationship unravels. When Annie's promising career as a cabaret singer rises Woody becomes threatened and goes to Los Angeles to bring her back.".

	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen's puerile comedy reaches a true dramatic climax through a bit of unintended irony in the oftendiscussed movie line scene.  In this scene we witness one pedant criticizing the pedantry of another in the middle of what is essentially a 90 minute diatribe.  This scene sets up the remainder of an unbelievably hubristic film in which we will watch Woody Why does he bother calling himself Alvy? promoting the person he admires most.  I'm still trying to understand how some might construe an assembly of selfconsciously scripted oneliners as a coherent story.  The humor in this film was so contrived that I began waiting for drumrolls after lines like I never undress in front of a man of my own gender and even began to wonder if a few years in Manhattan would see Rodney Dangerfield swapping jokes with Allen in an onstage partnership. By the time Woody uses all of the affect he can muster to pull off a suddenly sentimental closing scene I refused to believe that he actually felt capable of evincing some sort of emotional response from the audience. Pathos is never a temptation for the viewer who is simply not interested in Woody Allen's life or those of celebrities in general. As for the purported technical brilliance of the film obnoxious postmodern pandering I found it to be a hackneyed hodgepodge of Nouvelle Vague tricks pulled off with much less tact.  For the sake of comparison a film that does pull all of these elements together in a brilliantly funny and emotive package is Truffaut's Shoot the Piano Player.  Annie Hall was my first Woody Allen film and will probably be the last.".

	schema:headline " Disgusting boring monument to selfish and neurotic romance";
	schema:reviewBody "I realize I'm taking on an icon here but honestly this is the most disgustingly boring and overrated film to come out of the 1970's. It is unfortunate that the rather pathetic Woody Allen an admittedly intelligent man who alas squanders his considerable talents firmly believes that the cosmos revolves around his legendary neuroses. Even more unfortunate is the fact that he has succeeded in persuading a large percentage of the Western world to agree with him. Frankly it does not speak well of our culture.This yawn movie revolves around a pair of self absorbed lovers...a neurotic New York comedian Alvy Singer played by Woody and a wouldbe singer Annie Hall. The two both in analysis move in together so they can exchange tales of their professional paid for navel gazing. I certainly wouldn't want to imply that it might be simply for the convenient sex. The rest of this so called neurotic romance is far too inconsequential to bother detailing here.Annie Hall is played by Diane Keaton an actress who is actually very competent. Her movies are frequently not my favorite though I did enjoy the cute Baby Boom. Her only memorable aspect in this film is her Ralph Lauren clothes now of course quite dated which supposedly caused a fashion revolution at the time. That classic comment of Woody's regarding sex This is the most fun I've had without laughing doesn't particularly impress me with its brilliance. Fear not Shakespeare Woody serves as no threat to you as master of the English language. It is indeed sad that so many people seem to praise this mindless uninspiring unoriginal and not even particularly amusing pearl of wisdom as though it had virtually descended from the gods on Mount Olympus.Annie Hall isn't the absolute worst movie I've ever seen but it really doesn't have much to recommend it. I normally adore romances but neither one of these two selfish neurotics captured my sympathy or even remote interest. Furthermore the supposed witty banter between the pair failed woefully to either entertain or amuse me. Back in 1977 when I saw this movie at the theatre with my husband then boyfriend we both sincerely wished we'd found some paint and watched it dry instead. I guess this intellectual comedy was just far too complicated for little old us to appreciate.".

	schema:headline " Amusingly Awful Romance at Its Finest";
	schema:reviewBody "In typical Woody Allen style this film is a comment on pretentious New York City inhabitants fake and materialistic Hollywoodites and neurotic love relationships. Alvy is a somewhat overly intelligent somewhat pompous incredibly neurotic and slightly depressed comic. Annie is a woman who only gets pleasure out of smoking pot is not too intelligent and is too shy and nervous for her own good. Having these two characters fall in love seems slightly insane in itself but then again that's what Woody Allen was going for with this film. In many ways this film could be seen as kind of a comment on how film portrays romancehow unrealistic romantic relationships had been portrayed by Hollywood and how the unhappy ending is usually the more prevalent in reality.California more specifically Hollywood and L.A in this film is portrayed as a place full of overly tan vanity obsessed materialistic celebrities and their agents. Alvy being the model New Yorker hates California. Some of the most amusing lines in the film are between Alvy and Annie concerning the others' hatred for the two cities. Alvy's opinions on L.A all seem to hold up however so do Annie's opinions on New York. They're entirely polarized cities and the fact that Alvy and Annie don't choose the same city as their city of preference only emphasizes their differences even more. These two people are polar opposites just like L.A. and New Yorkthey don't belong together. Annie and Alvy are not the type of couple that Hollywood usually had fun portraying. They are not the Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett couple from Pride and Prejudice they are not Romeo and Juliet they are two people who are completely wrong for each other and know it but somehow can't seem to figure it out. Every time they break up they fall deeper into their depression because it's another failed relationship another thing they couldn't make work. They're constantly bickering and fighting and it doesn't really seem like love anymore after a certain point. It's the kind of love that only two mentally unstable and off base people can understand and considering Allen's real life love situations it becomes obvious that he is one of those people. This film is redefining romance redefining how people look at relationships. It doesn't work out for Annie and Alvy in the end and they both seem to be slightly okay with it. That's how things would have worked out for them in real life and that's what Allen wanted to portray. If he had been a conventional Hollywood director with classic notions of grandeur and romance then he would have had them live happily ever after. It's refreshing for once for the audience to figure out that not everyone gets that. Not all romances end with a ride off into the sunset.Annie Hall is also a critique of American culture and the elite intelligencia. Alvy and most of his acquaintances in New York are the kind of cynical and judgmental people who are so intelligent that it makes everyone else of moderate intelligence seem like morons and scum. Alvy even as a child as we see in multiple flashbacks has very high standards for people he would consider worthy of being able to share their opinions. One of the most humorous scenes in the film is when he and Annie are in the line to see a film about Nazi Germany and WWII and there is a pretentious man in line behind him spewing off his opinions on directors. When Alvy confronts him about his seemingly terribly wrong opinions he pulls out one of the directors to back him up. Alvy is the standard that the audience is supposed to hold everyone else up against. He is a neurotic man who never has nothing to say and is usually able to voice his opinion in a witty manner. The irony of this film is its greatest feature. The depressive and cynical comic who is too into himself to give anyone else the time of day meets and falls in love with an unintelligent and somewhat boring girl from the mid west who would usually do nothing for him. How could it not end up amusingly awful? Woody Allen is truly at his finest in this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is probably one of the worst if not the worst films to take home an Oscar. Woody Allen has made a career out of wiping his ego on celluloid and calling it a feature movie. It's funny how in every film of Woody Allen's he portrays the women in it as these stupid ditsy uninformed containers while he is always the allknowing critical sharpremarking neurotic genius who has been put there to enlighten these women on the world. Of course the relationship fails in this film as it reflects his personal life and taste in women...Annie Hall must have been too old for his liking or possessed too much of a will or a brain. What you do get in a Woody Allen film such as this is two hours of his crappy shallow dishonest diatribe that conceals the creep inside of the ego. Annie Hall feels more like a fake constructed front for a movie rather than delving into real emotional territory but then we are talking about Woody Allen.".

Fortunately by the mid80's people finally started to wise up to this shyster and that's why every movie he makes completely bombs.It's not about getting it  oh how I hate it when elitists like Allen fanatics try to pull that crap on people. It's just over your head... Woody is an acquired taste... He's for sophisticates... BULL. He SUCKS. He's a hack.I actually do like a few Woody Allen films. I repeat like. Play It Again Sam was OK. Broadway Danny Rose was OK. A few more were OK. But really. Annie Hall is a joke. It's not clever it's not funny it's not entertaining it's a farce. It's a great trick that Allen pulled on audiences and he got away with it. In 1977 he must have been laughing like mad behind everyone's backs. I can't believe how great they are saying this movie is!! My goodness. You gotta give Allen credit in a strange way though. For putting a mess like this out in theaters takes nerve. Politely smiling while everyone is praising your film that you know is a piece of crap takes nerve. Woody proves that old saying miscredited to P.T. Barnum is totally true!".

Being referred as one of Woody Allen's best movies I personally don't agree with it preferring many other movies made by this great director.

I think the casting was exceptional and she handled the material well.I tend to like to immerse myself in a movie. Woody's use of the aside talking to the audience is a little distracting but the short scene with Marshall McLuhan was a wonderful shot at selfabsorbed intellectuals.The plot idea is very good. I think so many of Woody Allen's characters in so many of his movies have been this same character over and over again. I think this is the definitive Woody Allen character. So much of his recent work as been a pale imitation.Even if you aren't a Woody fan I have to recommend this as a creative piece of comedic cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Back in 1977 Star Wars was conquering the entire world. Amassing box office numbers never before even imagined Star Wars was truly becoming a massive part of American culture very very quickly. With brilliant writing casting direction and also a good dose of fun Star Wars is handsdown one of the top movies of all time. It was expected to sweep the Oscars that year. But the film would be overshadowed at the Oscars by the quiet film Annie Hall. Annie Hall put Woody Allen on the map and made him a star. The film would also launch the career of Diane Keaton. Using a very unique form of storytelling that would become perfected by Quinten Tarantino Annie Hall is totally not the average love story for many many reasons.But just because of it being a different kind of film it does not make it any more entertaining. Annie Hall is charming it does have a few laughs but it is nowhere near the greatest film of all time. It is not worthy of the Best Picture Oscar nor is it worthy of being listed as a true classic. Instead the film should just be accepted as one of the more groundbreaking filming achievements of the 1970s and nothing more. Woody Allen's onejoke film the entire film focuses around the bizarre personality of the main character clocks in at a decent amount of time and offers a realistic bittersweet ending but seems to lack that punch that truly makes it a standout film.The story revolves around a very nervous and neurotic comedian by the name of Alvy Singer who falls in love with this interesting and pretty singer Annie Hall. Throughout the film you see the ups and downs of the relationships and also get glimpses into the pasts of both people in order to get an idea as to why they are the way they are and why they have so much chemistry together. The best part of this movie is the chemistry Allen and Keaton have. When they are together you can sense the love and care thy have for each other. Both performances were excellent they truly were the ones carrying the film. Everyone else in the film really carried no weight and are totally forgettable characters besides Christopher Walken's character which shared a very funny moment with Woody Allen.Annie Hall denies the fact that there is a fourth wall as the film has the main character talking to the audience. This is not the only bizarre element of the film. The movie has many things that prior to being released had not been witnessed before which included the thoughts of two people talking to each other as they engaged in conversation also has tons of flashbacks and moments in which the main characters interact with their past counterparts. All these little unique moments throughout the movie make this movie very fresh very different from the average romantic comedy. While these little things do enhance the experience a little it fails to save the movie from at times being a bit boring or a bit tedious. There is just way too much time in between laughs.The humor is at times a bit dry which could be another reason why it appealed to so many but did not appeal much to me. I personally thought Napoleon Dynamite was the worst comedy within the past three decades. Annie Hall is no Napoleon Dynamite mind you but it still lacks that edge that the better romantic comedies contain comedies like The 40yearOld Virgin When Harry Met Sally Pretty Woman and There's Something About Mary.Bottom Line Annie Hall is not worthy of having that Best Picture Oscar it should have gone to Star Wars for sure. I have never found Woody Allen that funny and I did not really see what was the big deal about this film. It is just an average mediocre love story told in a very unique way. While paving the way for interesting movie making from Robert Rodriguez Quinten Tarantino and others Annie Hall is an experimental film that appeals to some while failing to appeal to others. This is not the romantic comedy classic that everyone makes it out to be. Annie Hall superb performances barred by many slow and dull moments and boring situations not a classic in my standards.Score 410".

	schema:reviewBody "42plus is an Austrian mostly Germanlanguage movie from 2007 so this one has its 10th anniversary right now. The writer and director is Austrian Sabine Derflinger and she was in her early 40s when she made this one. If you take a look at the cast you will find a bunch of names like Tukur Michelsen Moretti and Matschenz that are certainly known to Germanspeaking audiences. In the center of this film that runs for roughly 1.5 hours we have a couple played by Tukur and Michelsen and as they go on a trip together we find out about their lack of faithfulness. Michelsen for example has a longtime affair with Moretti's character a colleague of Tukur's and at the same time she enters into an affair with a very young man played by Matschenz. And we find out a bit about these supporting players too. But the elaborations feel never on a level where we could really feel for the characters or care about what happens to them. And it certainly isn't helping matters at all that they are all really unlikable unfortunately. So yeah all in all this film is not more eventually than showing us how the elite pretty rich people here in the center of the movie knows no moral boundaries or shame. This is a connection that becomes obvious many many times throughout the entire film. I have seen other stuff by Derflinger and not liked it too much which is why I believe that maybe her approach just isn't in accordance with what I perceive quality film. So my dislike is perhaps a bit of a subjective note. But I still felt that the film turned out eventually as shallow as the people in it. However I don't think it is a failure which would have been almost impossible though given the cast. The negative still outweighs the positive and I recommend you to watch something else instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "While agreeing with the first reviewer that the plot could be summarised in the two words nothing happens very much the same thing could be said of Waiting for Godot and half the plays of Pinter. Indeed the style of dialogue is very reminiscent of Pinter with the five main characters each portraying an archetypical personality type.The main point of the film is that the five characters are operating in a moral vacuum and having to make their own decisions without influence from the law of the land or any other moral compass.It would seem that the Law is simply non existent in their world  they kidnap into a van in broad daylight in front of many witnesses without disguising the number plate and they finally let their victim go having inflicted on him an ordeal which would earn them each a long prison sentence with only the slightest word from John Hurt's character that they don't want to hear any more about it.No the whole point is that they like the characters in Lord of the Flies have to work it out for themselves.And this freedom allows them the range to each demonstrate their character with the finest of English acting. Some of their characters are rather hackneyed like Tom Wilkinson's who moves seamlessly from discussing with his mother about her favourite TV show into being a heartless thug in a manner reminiscent of the second scene of Pulp Fiction but the John Hurt character is beautifully drawn by script writer actor and director alike.John Hurt plays an elderly man who clearly fancied himself as a ruthless thug in his younger days and defines himself by his association with a psychopath gang leader. He is now treated with amused but slightly wary contempt by his friends but is still determined to show his teeth by egging the Ray Winstone character into terrible and sadistic acts of revenge. The irony is that in one of Winstone's psychotic daydreams when given the opportunity to offer violence himself his dentures fall out and he backs off showing him for the toothless windbag he is.The other major archetype is a louche gambler and homosexual predator played beautifully by Ian McShane. In a scene reminiscent of The Dice Man he agrees that life and death decisions are too hard for an individual to take and accordingly persuades Ray Winstone that the decision between flaying alive and release should be taken on the toss of a coin.The two main protagonists of the film are Ray Winstone whose drink shock and schizophrenia induced ramblings form the backbone of the script and Melvil Poupaud who never says a word and barely moves a muscle throughout the film. However among a group of psychopaths it is he playing the kidnapped French waiter who is the only one that the audience can relate to and it is a tribute to Director Malcolm Venville that we know exactly what is going through his mind despite his almost complete lack of expression.This is a film about the struggle between revenge blood lust and evil on the one hand and justice decency and humanity on the other. It is about a man working through a psychosis and returning to rational thought. It is about how people can reach their own moral selves without influence from Church Law or Society.It is far from an action film and if you want simple plot this is not the film for you but it is a beautifully crafted set piece delivered by a very fine set of actors performing a fine script and under subtle but powerful direction.".

He rounds up his friends Archie Wilkinson Meredith McShane Peanut Hurt and Cal Stephen Dillane and kidnaps her lover boy.What follows is talky and stagey but works if you're into tough guys dealing with sensitive issues of marriage and love to name a few. The dialogue is hilarious expletivefilled and at times kinda moving a long speech about love given by Colin especially. And the real joy is watching these actors work together. John Hurt viciously growls his dialogue as the group's meanest and oldest. McShane is polished and softspoken as a singlelifeloving homosexual. And Wilkinson Dillane and Whalley have less showy roles but play them well. Unfortunately the second half drifts into a confusing bit of madness from Colin that gives the supporting cast little to do. But Winstone going manoemano with the mostlysilent lover boy finds the torturedsoul inside this domineering tough and keeps you guessing how this all will end. Director Malcolm Venville creates suspense but can't overcome the condensed setting no matter how many flashbacks or clips of old movies Samson and Delilah plays into the film he uses and he fumble's the end's emotional climax but topnotch actors make Chest worth seeing.".

Aside from a few out shots scenes where the audience is allowed a bit more information about he background of the story and its characters this film feel like a stage play so finely wrought is the dialogue and the pacing of the piece. For those who saw and appreciated SEXY BEAST also written by Louis Mellis and David Scinto and using some of the same actors this film will reward. For those easily offended by foul language and physical violence this may be a film to pass. Aging gangster Colin Diamond Ray Winstone is informed that his wife of 21 years Liz Joanne Whaley is leaving him and in complete disbelief and denial his emotions gradually unfurl into violence he must discover the name of the lover. After sever beatings Liz tells him and we jump to a scene where Colin and his fellow crime friends are kidnapping the waiter Loverboy Melvil Poupaud whose intensity as an actor commands our attention despite his lack of dialogue in a van. Loverboy is taken to a filthy room beaten we suppose and is locked in a chest awaiting Colin's decision on how to handle the lad. Colin's friends include the mamma's boy Archie Tom Wilkinson the seemingly suave Mal Stephen Dillane the frankly gay Meredith Ian McShane and the evil Old Man Peanut John Hurt oddly enough the only background we know of these crooks is through flashback scenes with Archie caring for this mum Edna Dor and Meredith taking a call during a assignation with a nude lad on the sofa Ramon Christian. The point the friends are trying to make is that Colin is losing his grip on life because of the devastation and humiliation of being betrayed by his adulterous wife. They urge Colin to kill both Loverboy and Liz make a coin toss to decide whether the reluctant Colin kills or lets them go and when the toss comes up with a thumbs down decision Colin is left alone with Loverboy tied to a chair to discuss the future. How this discussion proceeds and how Colin arrives at his decision on how to complete this cycle is the bulk of the story. So not much happens here with a script that is as foul as dirt and as powerful as a corpse crushing machine  except the ability of this sterling crew of actors to bring to life characters who while they are terrifying on one level show incredible support for their abused friend on the other level. It is a taut actors' piece beautifully executed by actors and director Malcolm Venville. Not for the faint of heart but definitely for those who relish superb theatrics! Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "I really didn't think I would be writing a poor review about a movie with Winstone Hurt McShane Wilkinson and the still beautiful Joanne Whalley as central characters.However this was just a waste of their talents and a boring film to boot. Its a talkfest so if you don't fancy the idea of almost all of the film consisting of dialogue in one room this ain't for you. I liked the Before Sunrise and Before sunset movies with Ethan Hawke these were talkfests too but they had a point and the characters were clearly defined.In this movie you don't really know enough about anyone to really care you don't know if Ray Winstone really is a bad husband and how well his gangster mates know him and why they know him which is important in the whole witch hunt that takes place.The writers for this wrote the excellent sexy beast and it looks like they didn't have anything left creatively here. Does every UK movie have to have a gangster undercurrent its so overdone and this didn't help here neither did the excessive swearing I'm no prude but it just wasn't warranted if that was meant to portray Winstones mates as real hard cases it didn't work.And the ending was the biggest disappointment of all I ended up looking around in astonishment asking is that it then? It made all of what we had seen in the previous 85 minutes redundant.".

	onyx:emotionText "I really didn't think I would be writing a poor review about a movie with Winstone Hurt McShane Wilkinson and the still beautiful Joanne Whalley as central characters.However this was just a waste of their talents and a boring film to boot. Its a talkfest so if you don't fancy the idea of almost all of the film consisting of dialogue in one room this ain't for you. I liked the Before Sunrise and Before sunset movies with Ethan Hawke these were talkfests too but they had a point and the characters were clearly defined.In this movie you don't really know enough about anyone to really care you don't know if Ray Winstone really is a bad husband and how well his gangster mates know him and why they know him which is important in the whole witch hunt that takes place.The writers for this wrote the excellent sexy beast and it looks like they didn't have anything left creatively here. Does every UK movie have to have a gangster undercurrent its so overdone and this didn't help here neither did the excessive swearing I'm no prude but it just wasn't warranted if that was meant to portray Winstones mates as real hard cases it didn't work.And the ending was the biggest disappointment of all I ended up looking around in astonishment asking is that it then? It made all of what we had seen in the previous 85 minutes redundant.";

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this at the Sydney Film Festival but IMDb has it as in production so I may have seen an incomplete version. The pitch would have been something like Reservoir Dogs meets Last Orders. From Reservoir Dogs we get the basic setup of a bunch of crooks played by fine actors meeting in a lockup and debating what to do with their captive plus an enigmatic title and a flashback structure. From Last Orders comes a group of topnotch actors clearly enjoying themselves in a brown downbeat London.Some of the dialogue is fun if you like expletives spat out in poetrylike rhythms. There are good jokes and the acting is as you'd expect from this lot pretty fine. I was particularly pleased to see Stephen Dillane get his chance to prove himself cinematically after such an impressive theatrical career.The downside is the plot or rather the lack of it. The basic premise is laid out early on in the piece and there is no real conflict to maintain our interest. Contrast the uniformity of opinion here with the combustible dynamics of Mr Blond Mr White et al and the problem is clear. Some dream sequences intended to open the tale out feel forced and a couple of minor twists are inconsequential.If this script had been produced with a younger group of unknown actors it might get hailed for its promise. With this cast 44 Inch Chest can only be counted a disappointment.".

He's perhaps best known here in Oz for the wonderful Vincent but has been a real favourite for me since his early work.However if he'd got the saucepan and canopener out at some stage in these proceedings it could only have improved things.The opening scene is compelling with Winstone sprawled semiconscious on the floor amidst the wreckage of a family living room. As if the poor fellow clearly hadn't suffered enough already even if we aren't yet privy to the particulars of his situation the almostforgotten hideousness of Nilsson's Without You provides perfect background music.Our hero's friends and family rally round in this time of crisis and there's some diverting argybargy amid fantastic London locations as our group of protagonists is assembled. This stagesetting phase of the movie concludes with the group's arrival at a grimy terraced house  I use that phrase intentionally because at this point the film effectively becomes a conventional play spread over two locations.This terrific cast never exceeds or even equals the sum of its parts amid production values that call to mind BBC's Play For Today in the 70s and early 80s. RADA's likely advice from an earlier period for portraying cockneys also seems have been in play  drop yourself about 3 social classes and 50 IQ points and you'll be fine love.It's no mean feat to tell a fulfilling story within a bubble such as the one created here and it doesn't really come off  we never learn enough about the relationships between the players or the context that surrounds some of the remarks that are made.Yes Winstone's character is supposed to be confused I do understand that but I don't believe the audience should be sharing in that affliction.Stephen Dillane impresses but John Hurt's wasted here and with his illfitting dentures at least I ASSUME that's what they are ...  he channels Phil Davis doing his best Albert Steptoe impersonation at one of Mike Leigh's Christmas parties.The one lasting benefit for me is that I might just tone down my own bad language a little. They just don't stop in this film. Everyone knows that a welldeployed swear word can have massive impact but this dialogue is peppered with AngloSaxon to the point where it rapidly becomes not only meaningless but irritating.I suspect I sounded a little like this at the footy the night before and I can only promise my neighbours I'll try to be better in future ... if that works I'll tell my daughter she should seriously think about doing the same!".

Ian McShane was quoted prior to the release of 44 Inch Chest as saying this new film makes Sexy Beast look like Mary Poppins  well it does  it highlights how great Sexy Beast is and how poor and pointless 44 Inch Chest is. Of course McShane was talking about the strong language used in '44' which grows ever so tiresome after the first five minutes. That's the first problem with the film  too much swearing. I find colourful language funny and entertaining but when every character is spouting it out constantly the words lose their impact and meaning and it feels like the writers just added most of the expletives for the sake of it. The highlight for me was not the actual film but the offended couple who walked out of the cinema only half an hour in! I could've followed them to be fair because at this point the plot had not progressed at all. I knew there was still an hour to go and had confidence something would happen  it doesn't. Sexy Beast went from Athe villa to BLogan's arrival to CDEFGLogan's mood swings! to HLondon for the job to Iback to the villa again. '44' stays at A all the time with the slightest hints we might scrape to B but it doesn't ever happen. I did start thinking a possible twist was coming late on which may have redeemed the film somewhat but the hope came in vain. The acting was faultless as you'd expect from a cast of this calibre  it's the nonexistent plot which obviously takes the film nowhere and creates a wasted cinematic experience. I left the cinema so so so disappointed.".

I suspect that my being a woman is part of the reason that I like this film more than Sexy Beastwhich usually gets more stars. 44 Inch Chest is a lot like one of those movies where sorority sisters get together after 20 years apart and spill their guts and all walk away feeling better about themselves and each other because they are no longer pretending. Except in this film the sorority sisters are underworld criminals who like to say fk a lot. I say fk a lot too so I never felt like getting up and leaving the theater because of the profanity. And a good thing too. Because the last ten minutes or so of this movie are among the most powerful and true that I have ever seen.Women are not the only one's who hate themselves. And by hating themselves I mean hating their emotions. It is just that men and women are taught to hate different emotions. Women are allowed to grieve but not to express anger. That is why somewhere near the end of a chick flick all the women get mad. Really mad. And then they laugh and feel so much better.In the case of men anger is 100 fine. But men are not allowed to grieve. So we see a roomful of tough guys do what guys are supposed to doget brutal. And brutal again. And brutal some more Until the end when we realize that all that anger and brutality is meant to hide the sorrow and tears that men are never supposed to shed.Ian McShane is wonderful in this movie in large part because he plays a character who knows himself. And who is gently nudging the hero Ray Winstone to know himself too. That makes McShane the Master and Winstone the monk in need of enlightenment. Enlightenment when it comes is painful but it feels good too.If the violence in this film failed to satisfy maybe it is because the violence was never meant to satisfy. Maybe the film maker's goal all along was to make us cry.".

	schema:reviewBody "When i heard that Louis Mellis and David Scinto  the writers of one of my all time favourite films  Sexy Beast  were teaming up again to write the script to a film starring Ray Winstone and Ian McShane  i couldn't wait for it to come out. It seems to have been ages in the making but finally i got around to seeing it today on it's UK release and while it's no Sexy Beast it's the best movie i have seen so far in 2010. Colin Diamond is in agony shattered by the bombshell of his wife's infidelity with a young French waiter. His motley crew of friends  Old Man Peanut  Meredith  Archie  and Mal  kidnap Loverboy  and assemble a kangaroo court so that Colin can restore his manhood with revenge. A very bumpy night ensues for Loverboy whose life is at stake as Colin wrestles with heartbreak anger madness love and gargantuan selfpity.Within five minutes of the opening of 44 inch Chest  it is quite obvious you are watching a movie written by the same people as Sexy Beast . The language is that of Don Logan yet Logan is nowhere to be seen . This time we have fantastic characters such as Old Man Peanut  played brilliantly by John Hurt and Archie played by Tom Wilkinson. This in not a gangster movie  although the people we see are hardly squeaky clean. it's more a film about retribution  betrayal  forgiveness and hurt and no one shows those emotions better than Ray Winstone . He is quite superb as Colin Diamond and his performance is arguable his best to date. 44 inch Chest might not appeal to everyone  especially if you are offended by extreme language  but i have got to say  this was right up my street. Rumour has it that writers Louis Mellis and David Scinto have fallen out with each other and do not even speak and if that is the case it will be a tragic loss the British movie scene  so please guys  sort it out and keep scripts like this coming!".

The language is that of Don Logan yet Logan is nowhere to be seen . This time we have fantastic characters such as Old Man Peanut  played brilliantly by John Hurt and Archie played by Tom Wilkinson. This in not a gangster movie  although the people we see are hardly squeaky clean. it's more a film about retribution  betrayal  forgiveness and hurt and no one shows those emotions better than Ray Winstone . He is quite superb as Colin Diamond and his performance is arguable his best to date. 44 inch Chest might not appeal to everyone  especially if you are offended by extreme language  but i have got to say  this was right up my street. Rumour has it that writers Louis Mellis and David Scinto have fallen out with each other and do not even speak and if that is the case it will be a tragic loss the British movie scene  so please guys  sort it out and keep scripts like this coming!";

This is very well contrasted by Merediths McShane refusal to be tied and how it leaves him invulnerable but also somehow inhuman.

If this was Winstones first film he could easily win awards unfortunately for him the public has come to expect to see stuff like this from him. The other main actors also give excellent performances.This film must be viewed in its own light if you expect it to be a gangster film or a love story you will be disappointed. Take it as it is and it is well worth watching. It is certainly well written acted and produced and examines a subject familiar to most of us. However it still only feels like a 'little' film and will not stay with me so I can only give it an 8.".

Colin with the help of his gangster friends like Archie Old Man Peanut John Hurt Meredith Ian McShane and Mal Stephen Dillane decides to kidnap Liz's lover who is a French waiter. They bound him up and stick him in a wardrobe in a rundown building. Struggling with his internal frustrations Colin must decide whether he is going to kill the man who stole his wife.At just 95 minutes this minor British dramedy attempts to subvert the conventions and characterisation of the gangster genre. Whereas Guy Ritchie stylishly visualised the lives of the lowest ranked criminals in Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch director Malcolm Venville has opted to focus on the middle class variant of the underworld. With their comfortable homes and knowledge of culture these thugs seem to be a step up from the street work but regardless they are still foulmouthed primitive animals. They bash then interrogate the unnamed lover without letting him utter a word and their misogynist remarks directed at Liz ensures that there is little consideration for the choices that she has decided to make for herself. As bleak as this may sound the film is still regularly funny and edgy with a heavy reliance on four letter expletives for laughs. According to some sources one of the swear words is used at least 160 times throughout the film. Given that so much of the narrative takes place in just a single room with only a few flashbacks to show the audience what has happened previously it is testimony to the experience of the cast and their pinpoint delivery of this rather crude dialogue that one's engagement is still sustained.Yet for all the laughs that it earns the end leaves the film in its entirety as unsatisfying and superfluous. There has been a deliberate effort here to make the film anticlimactic and it is exactly that. It is meant to subvert the savagery and ruthlessness of the gangster's life but at the same time it simply leaves the audience asking what the point was. Whether Venville intended it or not the message is one that has been read many times before only here it is less satisfying crime doesn't pay. Any of the film's attempts to reach a deeper psychological understanding of Colin feels incoherent rather than intelligent. With such a short running time there will be many who will be left expecting more from this particularly narrow story.Even though the characters are enlivened more by the experience of the British cast rather than the quality of the script the performances are still uniformly solid. The only strain on credibility here is why a woman as beautiful as Liz would be so inclined to marry a brute like Colin. Ray Winstone is not as acceptable as a loving man but he is still adept at conveying the internal anger that swells up inside of him thinking about what he has lost. His performance works most efficiently as a means of passive expression. John Hurt steals this film as Old Man Peanut with a riotously funny performance and some outrageous dialogue. His retelling of Samson and Delilah complete with expletives is easily one of the film's very best moments.44 Inch Chest is a largely unmemorable British gangster film because of its small scale and its failure to amount to anything more than old men behaving badly.

The hard man who can't find the spirit for revenge the old man who lacks respect from others in his old age the lover who can't defend his love the wife who can't be faithful to the man who truly loves her and so forth. Victor Mature and Hedi Lamarr in the splicedin clip from 'Samson'  an antifeminist blast if ever I've seen one. The character who comes out best is the one played by Iain McShane. He is unremittingly witty has a functional attitude to sex yet has an eye for beauty. In the end the old man agrees to accompany him to the Clayton a gay cluband therefore seems to be getting to grips with his superannuated homophobia. The gangster's conversion through love gives rise to a new kind of world where other characters can find their true selves. What else could explain the grafting of the wife's head on to the old man's body for instance? As a nonhomophobic heterosexual male I'd have appreciated a lot more upfront honesty about the film's themes. I think I've just seen 'Brokeback Mountain Meets No Country for Old Men' but with British cultural references.".

The performances are outstanding a real ensemble of some of the best talent Briton has to offer. We take a journey through Ray Winstone mind as he begins to break down over his wife's betrayal loosing his grip on reality and the balls to carry out the job in hand. Well written beautifully directed gracefully acted and generous helping of crude British dialog makes this seasoned outing one to watch! 10 out of 10.. not a popcorn movie..

Ray Winstone John 'FG' Hurt Tom Wilkinson Ian 'Lovejoy' McShane and some guy called Stephen Dillane. With its slightly muddled beginning's one is led to believe that there is somewhat of a dilemma at stake. Ray Winstone's alcohol fuelled lost and idiocentric character Colin with his loose personality comes face to face with a situation that he clearly has no grasp of dealing with. So whom should he turn to in his hour of need? His trusting gangster friends of course. Nestled in a room for the majority of the film each of Colin's friends play their part in trying to comfort him in his hour of need or not as the case would seem. The centre of attention being Melvil Poupaud portraying a French waiter accused of committing sins with Colin's wife 'Liz' played by Joanne Whalley. What should Colin do with him? How does he tackle this scenario? The love of his life with another man? A French man!!! With his friends on board each offering their own unique words of wisdom you can all but feel Colin's mind fracturing into the unknown.Alone I feel that John Hurt's foul mouth is worth the entrance fee here's a guy who's pants I'd like to wear clean or soiled I'm not fussy. The guy really show piecing his talents here as an old school foul mouthed gangster and when I say foul I really mean foul I'm pretty sure that my mother would have a hernia should she witness some of the obscenities to fall out old John's mouth here. His character 'Old Man Peanut' retelling the story of Samson and Delilah in his own narrative is quite simply priceless. Ian 'Lovejoy' McShane adding a certain suaveness to his role as homosexual 'Meredith' shunning Old Man Peanut's homophobic remarks with confidence whilst Mommy's boy 'Archie' played by Tom Wilkinson is a lacklustre character who just really wants to go home a character that is seemingly fell into the criminal underworld by accident. Stephen Dillane plays slightly shady 'Mal' who Colin has his suspicions about or is it all in his head? I feel that the film could be quite easily misunderstood it is in essence a dialogue film with word play being order of the day breathing scantily clad undertones of Reservoir Dogs a film I always remember my Granddad going to see at the cinema on a holiday in Brighton to escape my Nan for the day he came out disgusted and disappointed in his choice. Naturally however this film is no Reservoir Dogs and it definitely won't appeal to all with its minimal scene locale and John Hurt's foul mouth. So if you want aesthetically pleasing locations and out of world experiences or if your put off by naughty words then you'd best stick with Avatar. But if your interested in witnessing some of Britain's finest meat play it out in a room together for 95 minutes then this movie is well worth a butchers look.710".

	schema:headline " Mars never looked so good...";
	schema:reviewBody "I have so much to say about this movie but I guess I should start with what or who is John Carter.John Carter Kitsch is an American Civil War soldier who is transported to Mars. He first encounters the green skinned warlike nomads known as the Tharks and due to his superhuman powers Mars gravity and all that quickly becomes embroiled in not only the political issues of the Tharks but those of the red skinned humanoid Martians as well. The humanoids control Mars through a series of city states with Zodanga annihilating everything in it's path. Helium is the last free state. Helium also has a beautiful and feisty Princess Collins and a political marriage to save all has been arranged. Then she meets our handsome hero.yep you guessed it. The two fall in love and are now fighting for not just what they love and believe in but who they love and believe in.This movie is based on the book Princess of Mars the first in a series of 11 novels written by Edgar Rice Burroughs 100 years ago. They are also known as The Barsoom or John Carter of Mars series. A lot of what you have seen in these types of movies up until now has drawn in some way on this series of novels. Star Wars Avatar Babylon 5 Flash Gordon and even some Indiana Jones. I am sure the list is endless but Sci Fi is not my genre. When you watch John Carter you will be able to pick the similarities immediately.If you are aware of this movie's existence then you are probably aware of the negative attention it has garnered. I saw this movie over 2 weeks ago and have had to watch as people all over the internet trash it. They have laughed at Disney for spending 250 million on an obvious dud. They have said Disney has distanced itself from the movie before it's release. They have criticised everything from the trailers to the posters to the casting of 2 unknowns as the leads. Oh and they have done all this without having seen the movie! These people are best ignored and sent back to their mother's basements!! Now I will say that Disney has done itself NO favours whatsoever with the posters and trailers for John Carter. This I will concede. But I have found the best trailer on You Tube and it was made by serious fans of the books thejohncarterfiles.Please if you are going to watch a trailer for this movie make it this one. It just gives you a much better idea of what the movie looks like.So what did I think? I LOVED it. I really truly did. I wanted to see it because I had read so much about it over the last few years. Sci Fi may not be my thing but that doesn't mean I don't know what's going on in the land of movie making.This movie has all the blockbuster action we have come to expect from this genre. The CGI is spectacular. The Martian characters are fantastic. The stand out Martian is without a doubt Woola a pet that adopts John Carter and is as ugly as he is adorable. An ugly slug like animal that will melt your heart. Trust me  There is good vs evil. There is Martian vs Martain. There is human vs human. There is serious stuff. There is fun stuff. A stand out scene I just cannot resist mentioning.When Carter does arrive on Mars his introduction to Tars Tarkas is absolutely hilarious. The mistake with his name becomes an ongoing gag throughout the movie and to great affect. Even our hero gives up smiles and just shakes his head. Oh and yes there is a very easy and believable reason why they all speak English.This movie is for everyone who likes Star Wars or Avatar. It's for everyone who ever wished they could go to Mars. It's for everyone who likes a love story between a handsome hero and beautiful spirited Princess. It's for everyone who wants to see a great movie and escape literally to another world for 2 hours. It's for everyone who likes a simple Sci Fi story. It's for everyone who likes a layered story they can think on a little later. It's for little kids although at over 2 hours running length it may just be a tad too long for our littlest movie goers and it's for big kids.Ignore the critics and go see this movie. I think you will enjoy it. I saw it in 3D and I usually think 3D is a waste of money sorry studios but for this movie fork out the extra 5 and see it in 3D.Mars never looked so good.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have so much to say about this movie but I guess I should start with what or who is John Carter.John Carter Kitsch is an American Civil War soldier who is transported to Mars. He first encounters the green skinned warlike nomads known as the Tharks and due to his superhuman powers Mars gravity and all that quickly becomes embroiled in not only the political issues of the Tharks but those of the red skinned humanoid Martians as well. The humanoids control Mars through a series of city states with Zodanga annihilating everything in it's path. Helium is the last free state. Helium also has a beautiful and feisty Princess Collins and a political marriage to save all has been arranged. Then she meets our handsome hero.yep you guessed it. The two fall in love and are now fighting for not just what they love and believe in but who they love and believe in.This movie is based on the book Princess of Mars the first in a series of 11 novels written by Edgar Rice Burroughs 100 years ago. They are also known as The Barsoom or John Carter of Mars series. A lot of what you have seen in these types of movies up until now has drawn in some way on this series of novels. Star Wars Avatar Babylon 5 Flash Gordon and even some Indiana Jones. I am sure the list is endless but Sci Fi is not my genre. When you watch John Carter you will be able to pick the similarities immediately.If you are aware of this movie's existence then you are probably aware of the negative attention it has garnered. I saw this movie over 2 weeks ago and have had to watch as people all over the internet trash it. They have laughed at Disney for spending 250 million on an obvious dud. They have said Disney has distanced itself from the movie before it's release. They have criticised everything from the trailers to the posters to the casting of 2 unknowns as the leads. Oh and they have done all this without having seen the movie! These people are best ignored and sent back to their mother's basements!! Now I will say that Disney has done itself NO favours whatsoever with the posters and trailers for John Carter. This I will concede. But I have found the best trailer on You Tube and it was made by serious fans of the books thejohncarterfiles.Please if you are going to watch a trailer for this movie make it this one. It just gives you a much better idea of what the movie looks like.So what did I think? I LOVED it. I really truly did. I wanted to see it because I had read so much about it over the last few years. Sci Fi may not be my thing but that doesn't mean I don't know what's going on in the land of movie making.This movie has all the blockbuster action we have come to expect from this genre. The CGI is spectacular. The Martian characters are fantastic. The stand out Martian is without a doubt Woola a pet that adopts John Carter and is as ugly as he is adorable. An ugly slug like animal that will melt your heart. Trust me  There is good vs evil. There is Martian vs Martain. There is human vs human. There is serious stuff. There is fun stuff. A stand out scene I just cannot resist mentioning.When Carter does arrive on Mars his introduction to Tars Tarkas is absolutely hilarious. The mistake with his name becomes an ongoing gag throughout the movie and to great affect. Even our hero gives up smiles and just shakes his head. Oh and yes there is a very easy and believable reason why they all speak English.This movie is for everyone who likes Star Wars or Avatar. It's for everyone who ever wished they could go to Mars. It's for everyone who likes a love story between a handsome hero and beautiful spirited Princess. It's for everyone who wants to see a great movie and escape literally to another world for 2 hours. It's for everyone who likes a simple Sci Fi story. It's for everyone who likes a layered story they can think on a little later. It's for little kids although at over 2 hours running length it may just be a tad too long for our littlest movie goers and it's for big kids.Ignore the critics and go see this movie. I think you will enjoy it. I saw it in 3D and I usually think 3D is a waste of money sorry studios but for this movie fork out the extra 5 and see it in 3D.Mars never looked so good.";

	schema:headline " John Carter A surprising gem that shines bright and true";
	schema:reviewBody "Star Wars Avatar and John Carter. That's the cinema progression although by now everyone knows that the John Carter books came first and inspired both Lucas and Cameron. As a devotee of the books  I appreciated Star Wars and Avatar but neither produced the level of excitement and readerviewer loyalty that Edgar Rice Burroughs did with his vivid and unforgettable tales of John Carter Dejah Thoris and Barsoom.So what has Andrew Stanton given us?Anwer A gem that shines bright and true with a light all its own. Stanton has taken the grandmaster's story but he's made it his own and it's fresh and emotionally stirring in ways that are unexpected and make you want to see it a second time and soon. The gem is not without a few rough edges  but the core brilliance is unmistakable and undeniable.Stanton is a subtle and sophisticated storyteller with a Pixarian's understanding of how to build characters that stay with you. Whereas Cameron in Avatar was content to extract the simple essence of the Burroughsian pulp narrative and just go with it Stanton keeps enough of that to keep the material recognizable but constructs characters that in deft and certain strokes emerge as fully realized beings who engage us and draw us in to their stories in ways that exceed what his predecessors Burroughs Lucas and Cameron were able to do. The result is a richer character driven experience that transcends the dear sweet old pulpy fiber on which it is based and becomes something grander richer and more satisfying.A word about how the film differs from what you're seeing in trailers The promotion promises spectacle and action and there is plenty of that but the promotion also suggests that the film will be a kind of childishly simple woodenly executed mashup of questionable seriousness featuring awkward performances and cartoonish characterization while the film itself is almost the inverse of thata thoughtful finely tune spectacle that is a feast of imaginative transport and whose few flaws flow from the fact that it's a three hour epic that plays in two hours and twelve minutes.Taylor Kitsch is convincing and natural and I never thought I'd be saying that based on the promotion. Lynn Collins is luminous and elevates fully to the level of the incomparable Princess of Helium  genuinely beautiful and strong of will and heart. Willem Dafoe as Tars Tarkas and Samantha Morton as Sola Mark Strong as the delicious villain Matai Shang  the cast is without exception strong. The special effects are state o the art and seamless  and the music by Michael Giachinno deserves special mention haunting unique and uniquely suited to the material and the editing by Eric Zumbrunnen seamlessly supports the narrative.The flaws amount to quibbles The film feels lean and compact at 2 hours and 12 minutes and feels as if it could benefit greatly from 10 additional minutes which could have been used profitably to better set up the moment when John Carter and Dejah Thoris close the deal on their love and clarify some story points that are there  but could be highlighted more. Another beat of John Carter's life among the Tharks implying a passage of time would cause John Carter's later knowledge of the Tharks and their culture to make more sense as it is now he seems to pick it up in a matter of days and as audience we never see where that knowledge comes from . Another beat of John Carter absorbing the new world he finds himself in and implicitly comparing it to what he left behind would be welcome and would strengthen the impact we would feel when he makes that choice. But these minor points should not distract for the overall brilliance with which Stanton has executed a challenging assignment.This is a film that bears watching more than once and is complex and nuanced enough that subsequent viewings will no doubt reveal new treasures and clarify the minor rough edges  yet it is also compelling and moving on an immersive first viewing in the theater. Perhaps the best indication of that is the fact that in spite of my supposed knowledge of and sensitivity to film structure  I was taken by surprise when it ended and was in no way ready for it to end. Could the full two hours have gone by that fast? How? And as I sit here writing about it the next morning if there were an opportunity to go back and see it again tonight I would do so without hesitation and quibbles aside that's a simple but ultimately profound recommendation.A final thought Like everyone I've got plenty of things going on in my life and my world distracting things things that makes me worry things that drag my mind out of a movie when I'm watching it and back into my world. Not one little tiny bit of that intruded into this movie. I was transported and when it was over I couldn't believe that was it  I thought there was at least another 45 minutes owed to the audience. On a visceral level without trying to overthink it  that says a lot about what Andrew Stanton has accomplished building on the foundation of the grandmaster Edgar Rice Burroughs.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this at a preview screening in London.I never read any of the books so only had a vague synopsis of the story just from trailers which didn't really impress me much. Well this turned out to be quite a blast. Its an enjoyable if very cheesy Scifi fantasy blockbuster. It has the spirit and energy of Flash Gordon including its own outrageously nonsensical but fun premise. It isn't as cheesy as that film but there is a definite lean towards it. The story is quite a novel mix of Planet of the Apes Conan Red Sonja Avatar Star Wars and Superman yep this is a superhero movie too. We even have a western thrown in the mix at the beginning. I was going to say there isn't anything original here but how can I? This story was published in the 19th century so from that perspective I can now see a lot of plot influences deriving from this in later SFfantasy films.A lot of money was spent on this movie and it shows. The special effects here are pretty awesome. Not necessarily ground breaking everything on screen has been done before but its all smoothly done at a grand scale though not quite to the scale of the Star Wars prequels. Effects that stood out for me were John Carters Hulk like jumps Martian sky ship battles green martians as good as Avatar and a cute monster dog sidekick that almost steels the show.Another major feature of the film was the cinematography. Its quite spectacular and for a barren dead desert planet its surprisingly stunning.One of the biggest surprise for me was the 3D. Its post conversion which most often results in poorer quality than films which are filmed in 3D from the start. But an exception can be made here. This is hands down the best 3d conversion film I have seen. The 3d depth was outstanding and really shows its power in numerous landscape and action scenes. This is probably the second best 3d live action film I've seen overall either filmed in 3d or post converted and I am normally anti3d when it comes to live action films. Taylor Kitsch who plays John Carter has just about enough screen presence portraying a likable anti hero with a punchy attitude and a sense of past history haunting him. Its a Han Solo type role but he plays it more brooding. There is even a Princess Leia and the age old storyline of helping a Princess to fight a war but each with their own agendas. Its all very clichd yet still enjoyable. As much fun as I had with this there is no denying that there is a lot wrong with it too. I could pick on flaws and lack of logic all day long with this film some of which are smack on the head stupid and some elements I desperately wished more or better development on. The dialogue while often funny also often dive bombs into cringeworthiness much like a Lucas script the developing romance was very disjointed and sometimes embarrassing think Anakin and Padme levels of embarrassment. The 3 way war politics was not very clear major characters not fleshed out enough and there's a whole lot of story loopholes. Yet there is still a lot more fun to be had to override those flaws. I have a feeling that book lovers will be disappointed because I can detect a lot of back story is missing here and key characters seem very short changed on their development and motives particularly with the green martians which I am sure would have been fully fleshed out in the book. However I reckon if you enjoy films like Thor and GI Joe you'll have a great time with this. This wont be a classic or even a cult movie but it is a satisfying piece of cinema escapism. And its enough for me to want to read the books!".

	schema:headline " John Carter Stunningly Effective";
	schema:reviewBody "Hearing about this Disney film's story sparked my interest in seeing this right away! I finally did and overall the characters the setting and the plot flowed seamlessly well together! It's like Disney's formula of Star Wars and Avatar meets Prince of Persia Sands of Time. So the plot revolves around a Civil War veteran who is somehow transported to Barsoom aka Mars where he must help a princess and a colony succeed in a heated battle against another feuding colony.Director Andrew Stanton delivered well in this epic take of John Carter. Sure star Taylor Kitsch seems like he's trying a little too hard as the lead guy but it looks like he's heading toward the same path left behind by Jake Gyllenhaal for Prince of Persia serious character figure yet sometimes able to show unintentional humor usually without noticing. Though not bad on either one's part! Since John Carter was conceived as a story back in 1912 by Edgar Rice Burroughs of Tarzan fame I have to say that this movie is certainly NOT a ripoff. A film like this deserves more credit than initially given! Epic actionadventure films like Star Wars and Avatar wouldn't exist today without these early roots! It pretty much sparked an influence on the scifi action adventure genre films that most audiences came to know decades later.It looks like Stanton's following exactly what his fellow Pixar colleague Brad Bird had done with Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol stepping up as director for once in liveaction! Not bad for their first time.".

	schema:headline " Becoming John Carter of Mars...";
	schema:reviewBody "Not a movie about Noah Wyle's character from the show ER but rather one based on a book I've never read titled A Princess of Mars. Originally going to be titled John Carter of Mars the movie apparently dropped the 'of Mars' to make it more appealing to a broader audience and this film is supposed to be the origin story about a guy becoming John Carter of Mars  this probably explains why we finally get the originallyintended title of 'John Carter of Mars' at the very end.The man in question is John Carter from Virginia exCivil War soldier who lost his family and is now gold prospecting. Proceedings are rather slowgoing in the beginning of the film although it's necessary setup for what's to come. Things don't really get interesting until Carter's transported to Mars which is known as Barsoom by the inhabitants there who are 9 to 15 foot tall fourarmed green aliens with tusks called Tharks. Thanks to the lower gravity of Mars Carter has enhanced strength and can leap great distances. We even get a montage devoted to him discovering as much. Some Tharks discover him the least hostile of which is one named Tars Tarkas voiced by Willem Dafoe who winds up thinking Carter's name is Virigina due to miscommunication. Subtitles are used up until Carter is eventually able to understand the Tharks and we hear them speaking in English. At one point he comes to the rescue of an alien dog named Woola who is extremely loyalfast and becomes his constant companion. Carter also finds an ally in Sola Samantha Morton. Eventually he meets the Princess of Mars herself Dejah Thoris after having rescued her it's what he does. And this is where the real story begins.As John Carter and Dejah Thoris Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins reunite after the rather hohum affair that was XMen Origins Wolverine. Kitsch fits the role of the longhaired hero well although he is saddled with some rather dodgy dialogue at times. His reactions to the bizarre situations customs etc that he finds himself having to deal with are pretty good. He is wellpaired with Lynn Collins who manages to make Dejah actually very human like when she's nervous about the presentation she's about to give when we first meet her in the citystate of Helium...though oddly enough nobody there speaks with funny highpitched voices like you'd expect. She's certainly the prettiest thing on Mars but she's also very smart as well as able to handle herself in a fight. She's equal parts scientist and action heroine. Kitsch and Collins play off each other very well sharing both humorous and touching moments between them. Also good is James Purefoy as Kantos Kan. Although it's not a big role he manages to make the most of it and is easily likable as well as amusing at times. Mark Strong meanwhile continues to be the goto guy for playing a villain.The story is not exactly easy to follow if you aren't paying attention. There's a lot of names of things to keep track of as well as some twists and turns here and there. The film feels like it kind of rushes things a bit towards the end as it has to wrap up stuff. Given the running time you wouldn't think things would need to be like this but it seems the makers realised their movie was reaching the limit of its runtime and there was still some stuff left to address at the last minute.The effects on display are as dazzling as Dejah's blue eyes. The thought and effort that has gone into designingcreating the creatures the ships the costumes etc is fully on display on the screen. The music helps too. While this movie might not be everyone's cup of tea it does offer something a bit different in place of what could have been a rather paintbythenumbers affair. Yes some parts are predictable but there are also some parts that you might not expect. Don't let the trailers fool you it's not just all mindless action. There is some actual real story going on here provided of course that you can keep track offollow it. Recommended for anyone who's looking for a slightly offkilter scifi film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a man of obsessions. For months a movie I hadn't seen was the thing. Not Peter Jackson's THE HOBBIT not Joss Whedon's THE AVENGERS not even the upcoming Sam Mendes directed James Bond movie SKYFALL which I'm excited about but it hasn't really sunk its hooks into me yet...No it was Andrew Stanton's JOHN CARTER.My excitement was not the universal feeling. Disney advertising had dropped the ball and the trailers seemed lackluster to most. Yet something within directed me toward it like a compass points to True North. There was something special about it something just out of view in the trailers that wouldn't let me go. I trust my obsessions always but at some point I got to feeling a bit exhausted and just wanted to know if I was right or maybe a total loon.I've now been to two advance screenings of JOHN CARTER.And? Holy Living Thark! The bar on science fiction and fantasy movies has Officially Been Raised.JOHN CARTER is based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' A Princess of Mars a novel first published a century ago. I expected to come out of the movie with my head full of comparisons to all the things Burroughs' imagination inspired STAR WARS AVATAR FLASH GORDON etc. Understandably so as I'm much more familiar with all of them. That didn't happen. Put simply if STAR WARS is a kids' science fiction movie franchise that adults enjoy and it is then JOHN CARTER is an adult science fiction movie that kids will enjoy.CARTER is such an immersing experience. Every moment reveals something new about Mars about the exotic alien races and cultures that call it home or about their individual characters. James Cameron's AVATAR showed us a world we've never seen before and it was wondrous to behold but Andrew Stanton's JOHN CARTER is a movie so rich with detail that it left me feeling like I had been somewhere. JOHN CARTER feels like nothing so much than as if David Lean had made a science fiction epic of love and war set on Mars.This movie has a confidence to it you won't be expecting. It's unafraid to linger over the characters and give them time to breathe and reveal themselves. My favorite decade for movies is the 1960s and JOHN CARTER has some of the epic adventure movies of that time running through it like a seam of gold. There's a bit of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA in there as I alluded to before and perhaps a touch of ZULU and SPARTACUS is mixed in with the Martian airships and predator cities. Old fashioned storytelling magic and 21st century movie sorcery have combined into a film that's a pulp scifi masterpiece.To the ERB faithful please relax. Yes there are changes from the novel no they are not the arbitrary changes made in inferior movie adaptations where the filmmaker just wants to do hisher own ideas. Every change is made to tell Burroughs' story or reveal some aspect of Burroughs' characters in a way more befitting a movie instead of a novel.Going into this I had absurdly high expectations. A friend of mine told me he was worried the movie wouldn't live up to them and that frankly I was starting to sound a little crazy. Well the movie went and exceeded my expectations. I love it and give it a 1010. I'm definitely going to see it at least six times in the theater and will finally buy a BluRay player just to watch it at home.I realize this review sounds over the top. That's just how excited I am about the movie. Perhaps in a previous life I was an ancient Greek by the name of Hyperboles? Anyway see the movie. I guarantee that even if you don't like it as much as I did you'll see where I was coming from with this gushing review.".

The movie is a whirlwind of amazing visuals powerful dialog and soulwrenching storytelling.I'd had high hopes that this movie would live up to the hype surrounding it. It surpasses it the hype doesn't even come close. From beginning to end this movie focuses on story and expands on a great story with stunning effects as opposed to just using great FX in place of solid storytelling.It also has one of the strongest pieces of nonverbal storytelling outside of Up.Do not miss this film. Do see it in the theaters. Do see it in 3D.You will not be disappointed. I'm certainly chomping at the bit for release day so I can see it again and I'm already hoping for a sequel based on The Gods of Mars.".

	schema:headline " Spectacular  Transporting  Surprisingly Moving High Adventure Epic!";
	schema:reviewBody "By my standards mustsee films are getting to be rather rare. This one is by all means a MUSTSEE for everyone who loves science fiction andor super heroes! Long before Superman there was John Carter. Many have very likely forgotten what a resourceful and imaginative writer Edgar Rice Burroughs was. Most people only know he authored the original TARZAN. The movie JOHN CARTER is based on Burroughs' novel A PRINCESS OF MARS and his 1911 vision of an advanced civilization on Mars is truly astonishing. Upon seeing this the first question you will likely ask is How is it no one has filmed this fantastic mindblowing eyepopping compelling scifi adventure saga before? Well there have been a few faint attempts but the true realization of John Carter's magnificent adventures waited patiently for the masterful CGI wizardry of director Andrew Stanton and the 2012 resources of DisneyPixar. Amazingly Mr. Stanton shot this heavily CGIbased epic on film! According to the director he did so simply to see what it was like to make a movie like this on film before film is gone. The experience apparently has made him a fan of the classic motion picture medium and I imagine we will hear more from him on why. Of course I'm not going to give anything away. Suffice it to say that thankfully JOHN CARTER is a complete film experience a suspenseful dazzling story  efficiently and superbly told  with dramatic and unforgettable visuals  and compelling moving performances. Lynn Collins is particularly brilliant and beguiling as the exotic and dynamic Martian princess. Throughout the film the detail is extraordinary and the pacing is right on the mark relentlessly drawing you forward into the wonder of this newly discovered challenging turbulent world. What a magnificent adventure saga! Let's put it this way if you liked Sinbad you will LOVE John Carter. Thanks to a surehanded director an inspired cast and state of the art technical people it's a fulfilling experience that I predict will remain with you always  especially if you are among the young! JOHN CARTER is the ultimate exotic adventure a masterpiece of cinematic action and pacing.".

I've never seen such a spectacular movie. My dream fulfilled A new overwhelming sf spectacular which isn't part of the Star Wars or Star Trek franchise but opens a new rich and fantastic world and which has in opposite to the SW prequels a logical and intricate story.All my hopes that it won't bomb but allow new adventures with John Carter on the Mars to be filmed.".

My dream fulfilled A new overwhelming sf spectacular which isn't part of the Star Wars or Star Trek franchise but opens a new rich and fantastic world and which has in opposite to the SW prequels a logical and intricate story.All my hopes that it won't bomb but allow new adventures with John Carter on the Mars to be filmed.";

	schema:headline " A Worthwhile Adaptation";
	schema:reviewBody "Edgar Rice Burroughs' A Princess of Mars just about created the last 50 years of Hollywood blockbusters. Star Wars is SO ripped off of that book... and of course practically everything else is ripped off of Star Wars. So it's great that someone finally tackled the one and only original.And it's quite a good adaptation. I enjoyed seeing Burroughs' creations brought to life and I enjoyed John Carter as a movie in its own right. It's not a great film... but it's just the sort of escapist adventure that Burroughs himself specialized in.The same sort but not the same one. The movie takes liberties with the original material... and rightly so. ERB's original story would be creaky by today's standards so there's no use being too faithful. But some of the departures are needless and poorly chosen.1. The first compromise is the title. A Princess of Mars is a great title. It tells you pretty much exactly what to expect romance adventure and a strange new world. John Carter is a lame title. It could refer to just about anything from a hardboiled detective story to a teen romance. It may seem like a small thing but the title really did color audiences' reactions to the film. Yes the original title would have seemed strange in today's culture but that would have worked in its favor. The change of title was a weak decision made by a committee.2. Another compromise is the way the film starts. The whole introductory segment with the airborne battle on Mars is not only pointless it drastically weakens the story. John Carter is a tale of one man who suddenly finds himself in an unimaginably strange environment. We should have discovered that environment as Carter does and not had a sneakpeek ahead of time. This weakens our sense of identification with Burroughs' interplanetary Odysseus and shifts the emphasis to the story which was never ERB's strong suit. This was another decision made by a gutless committee. Someone in a meeting said the intro is too slow we'll lose the audience. They were dead wrong. To make great movies you have to take chances build at the pace dictated by the material and trust your audience to come along.3. The final and most significant compromise lay in attempting to modernize the story. I recently reread the first several Mars books for the first time in decades. They're surprisingly intimate lowkey affairs. There's a background of great events but the real story takes place on a very human scale. There are conversations confrontations. Meetings in darkened rooms. The action is there but it's far from 'nonstop.'What's more one of the real charms of ERB's Barsoom is that it represents the future as seen through the naive eyes of 1912. It really makes sense only when seen in that historical context. And it then acquires an extra nostalgic dimension giving us an insight into the mind and imagination of that fargone era. Modernizing the story homogenizes it and makes it seem like a metoo creation. Going for more of a retro steampunk look would have emphasized that this is THE granddaddy of all interplanetary adventures. A more explanatory marketing campaign would have helped too. Epic FAIL Disney.Going for more of an oldfashioned feel would also have allowed the film to preserve some of ERB's marvelous literary quality. His plots may have been pure melodrama but his language was amazingly poetic. Rereading the Mars books I found myself frequently pausing to marvel at a particular sentence or a single phrase words so perfectly chosen that they simply could not be improved upon. Some of that should have made it's way into the dialog of John Carter. There's a marvelous exchange between Errol Flynn and an English judge at the beginning of the movie Captain Blood. It sets up the sense of romance for the rest of the film. I'd have liked the air battle of John Carter to have been replaced with something like that.Fortunately the film does capture many other elements of ERB's vision. The green Tharks for one. They simply could not be better... they're absolutely true to the weird descriptions in the books yet manage to rise above their CG limitations and live as characters.I also adored the choice of Lynn Collins to play Dejah Thoris. Though of course she should have been wearing full redskin makeup. She's not exactly a powerhouse in the acting department but she's got the perfect look she's exactly the Princess of Mars that I wanted to see. I'd have loved to see her grow into the part through a long course of sequels...All in all despite its limitations John Carter is a fine adventure film that does manage to convey at least some of the magic of Edgar Rice Burroughs' writing. It does require a strongerthanusual suspension of disbelief but I'd recommend it highly to fans of classic swashbucklers.".

	schema:headline " Tarzan on Planet Mars";
	schema:reviewBody "Oscar winning Finding Nemo director Andrew Stanton struggles to make Edgar Rice Burroughs' vintage cowboys and aliens epic John Carter into a spontaneous largerthanlife saga about tyranny and rebellion on the Red Planet. Mind you Asylum Entertainment beat Disney Studios to the punch with its own abysmal adaptation of the Burroughs' novel A Princess of Mars that recycled just about every genre clich. Essentially Disney and Stanton have delivered what looks like a synthesis of The Outlaw Josey Wales and Star Wars. This is one of those scifi actioneers with a universe populated by anthropomorphic animals and mythological Clash of the Titans intermediaries. Burroughs penned his colorful pulp escapism about a century ago in 1912 before stories like it became commonplace. Since Hollywood lacked the computer generated technology to make the world of fantasy appear believable on celluloid the filmmakers preoccupied themselves with Burroughs' less challenging Tarzan novels. By the time Tinsel town conjured up the technology to produce movies about similar escapades on other worlds the studios had gone off on their own tangents. In other words the John Carter novels languished in obscurity while later epics like Star Wars Dune and Avatar emerged and appropriated similar themes. What had been groundbreaking when Burroughs wrote it now looks hackneyed even though Burroughs forged the formula that others imitated. The cinematic John Carter gives new meaning to the adage about the first being last. Sadly too despite its imaginative special effects this yarn amounts to another cookie cutter scififantasy melodrama that suffers from a sense of dj vu.Disillusioned Confederate cavalry officer John Carter Taylor Kitsch of The Covenant is prospecting for gold in Arizona when the U.S. Seventh Cavalry tries to recruit him to combat hostile Apaches. Carter refuses not only because this isn't his fight but also because he has already the Civil War claimed the lives of his wife and daughter. Carter escapes from the guardhouse purloins a horse and absconds into wilds. Our hero doesn't get far before he finds himself caught between the Apaches and the triggerhappy cavalry. Gunfire erupts and Carter struggles to escape from the predatory redskins. Scrambling for the sanctuary of a cave that the superstitious savages refuse to enter he surprises an ethereal alien with a supernatural medallion. Carter blasts this extraterrestrial confiscates the pendant and then suddenly finds himself sprawled on distant Mars. Mars resembles the rugged American southwest with its inhospitable terrain and inhabitants. He encounters tall lightgreen warriors. These fellows boast an additional pair of arms heads that resemble the Mutant Ninja Turtles and large threetoed feet. These fourarmed creatures with small tusks protruding from their jaws behave like barbarous African tribesmen and have domesticated animals to serve as their beasts of burden. When Carter isn't tangling with their garrulous giants he contends with striking humanoid natives covered with tattoos who fly extraordinary mechanical airships which resemble Leonardo da Vinci's designs. The barbarians reside in the outlands while the humanoids live in metropolitan cities of Helium and Zodanga. Basically a civil war has been raging for a thousand years between these rivals when John Carter arrives. The treacherous Sab Than Dominic West Jeddak of Zodanga wants to slaughter the citizens of Helium. A mysterious society of Therns led by the villainous Matai Shang Mark Strong who serve the goddess Issus intervenes and arms the Zodangans with a powerful weapon called the Ninth Ray. Helium has nothing to match this devastating blue laser technology. The Therns however refuse to let the Zodangans annihilate Helium. They advise Sab Than to marry the Princess of Helium Dejah Thoris Lynn Collins to create a stronger society. The defiant Princess flees and Sab Than pursues her. He destroys her ship buts she falls into John Carter's arms. On Mars our eponymous protagonist isn't the same fellow as he was in Virginia. He can leap vast distances and packs a haymaker of a punch that drops his adversaries as if they were straw. Predictably Carter falls in love with the princess and she reciprocates. Stanton Samurai Jack scenarist Mark Andrews and SpiderMan 2 scribe Michael Chabon do a fair to middling job with their adaptation. Happily this franchise inducing nonsense isn't too Disneyesque but they have taken considerable liberties with Burroughs' book. Anybody who has seen enough scifi fantasies will spot the elements that inspired those who came after Burroughs to use them in their movies. Essentially John Carter constitutes a Stranger in a Strange Land. Like the quintessential adventurer our hero embarks on a long journey and blunders into a civil war of sorts between two antagonistic factions. You don't need a Cliff Notes guide to distinguish the heroes from the villains on Mars. Incidentally Mars isn't really Mars. Instead the natives refer to it as Barsoom. One of the problems with any movie about an alien world is the environment as well as the natives. Everything might as well be happening on Earth for all of the difference that it makes. Since our hero is a foreigner on Mars he learns rather painfully that his human powers enable him to do things in their atmosphere that he couldn't accomplish at home. The action often bogs down in complications and it appears that some of the plot doesn't reach the screen. Further the leads lack charisma. Taylor Kitsch supplies sufficient brawn but he acts like a wooden Johnny Depp while Lynn Collins looks like she has spent more time in the gym than a science laboratory. Dominic West fares best with his arrogant portrayal of an enemy bent on destruction but you never really hate him with any passion. He is more of a pawn of the Therns. The enigmatic Therns are an irritating bunch of opportunists with a nasty habit of shapeshifting into other characters. Altogether despite it picturesque settings John Carter emerges as a predictable yarn that delivers few revelations.".

When Carter isn't tangling with their garrulous giants he contends with striking humanoid natives covered with tattoos who fly extraordinary mechanical airships which resemble Leonardo da Vinci's designs. The barbarians reside in the outlands while the humanoids live in metropolitan cities of Helium and Zodanga. Basically a civil war has been raging for a thousand years between these rivals when John Carter arrives. The treacherous Sab Than Dominic West Jeddak of Zodanga wants to slaughter the citizens of Helium. A mysterious society of Therns led by the villainous Matai Shang Mark Strong who serve the goddess Issus intervenes and arms the Zodangans with a powerful weapon called the Ninth Ray. Helium has nothing to match this devastating blue laser technology. The Therns however refuse to let the Zodangans annihilate Helium. They advise Sab Than to marry the Princess of Helium Dejah Thoris Lynn Collins to create a stronger society. The defiant Princess flees and Sab Than pursues her. He destroys her ship buts she falls into John Carter's arms. On Mars our eponymous protagonist isn't the same fellow as he was in Virginia. He can leap vast distances and packs a haymaker of a punch that drops his adversaries as if they were straw. Predictably Carter falls in love with the princess and she reciprocates. Stanton Samurai Jack scenarist Mark Andrews and SpiderMan 2 scribe Michael Chabon do a fair to middling job with their adaptation. Happily this franchise inducing nonsense isn't too Disneyesque but they have taken considerable liberties with Burroughs' book. Anybody who has seen enough scifi fantasies will spot the elements that inspired those who came after Burroughs to use them in their movies. Essentially John Carter constitutes a Stranger in a Strange Land. Like the quintessential adventurer our hero embarks on a long journey and blunders into a civil war of sorts between two antagonistic factions. You don't need a Cliff Notes guide to distinguish the heroes from the villains on Mars. Incidentally Mars isn't really Mars. Instead the natives refer to it as Barsoom. One of the problems with any movie about an alien world is the environment as well as the natives. Everything might as well be happening on Earth for all of the difference that it makes. Since our hero is a foreigner on Mars he learns rather painfully that his human powers enable him to do things in their atmosphere that he couldn't accomplish at home. The action often bogs down in complications and it appears that some of the plot doesn't reach the screen. Further the leads lack charisma. Taylor Kitsch supplies sufficient brawn but he acts like a wooden Johnny Depp while Lynn Collins looks like she has spent more time in the gym than a science laboratory. Dominic West fares best with his arrogant portrayal of an enemy bent on destruction but you never really hate him with any passion. He is more of a pawn of the Therns. The enigmatic Therns are an irritating bunch of opportunists with a nasty habit of shapeshifting into other characters. Altogether despite it picturesque settings John Carter emerges as a predictable yarn that delivers few revelations.";

	schema:reviewBody "In the large view this film is passable entertainment featuring lots of sword play eerie landscapes bizarre alien creatures air combat laser blasts  the sort of stuff Hollywood loves to include in all SF blockbusters. Evoking memories of the Flash Gordon serials of yesteryear and the original Star Wars trilogy the movie tries hard to be visuallyappealing and actionfilled while remaining as faithful as possible to the source material Edgar Rice Burroughs' ERB A Princess of Mars. As a huge fan of SF and ERB and as someone who has read most of ERB's books I have to commend Disney for turning out an interesting film despite highly compressing the story to fit a two hour time frame. As is the case with most novels made into movies John Carter takes story elements that the novelist carefully unfolded in 10 or 20 pages and gives it 30 seconds on screen. Other reviewers have said the story as told by the film feels rushed which is true.John Carter's development from a stranger in a strange land to a mighty warrior respected and prized by the Tharks also felt rushed in the film. I am certain that viewers unfamiliar with the books do struggle to keep the story straight as it blitzes forward. I'm hoping the movie will revive interest in the original books.A major nonERB element added to the film is the elevation of the Holy Therns who play a relatively minor role in the ERB books to the status of alien masterminds who insidiously control all aspects of Barsoom's politics and culture. This in my mind significantly changes the complexion of the original novels. Obviously the main purpose of the Therns in the film is to speed up the action and give the audience tangible bad guys to jeer at.Despite these deviations from the original novel John Carter I think succeeds in appealing to modern film goers while remaining relatively faithful to the source material. Going in I was extremely fearful that Carter would suffer the same fate that Hollywood dealt to another one of my pulp heroes Doc Savage whose movie appeal was destroyed by the disastrous 1975 film. Thankfully John Carter has not gone the way of Doc Savage Man of Bronze.".

In the opening minute I was ready to knock the film down for missing some of the significant details of The Murders in the Rue Morgue. Except this film isn't trying to faithfully recreate anything you just have to get interested in a Poebased detective story.Yes it is fairly gruesome. Perhaps more blood and violence than you would typically find in a Poe story but as the newspaper editor insisted that's what the people want. That's likely true but what I like about Edgar Allan Poe's writing is the intelligence prose and soulfulness that would be hiding amongst all the murderers and dead bodies. Most stories can be deduced to be about something entirely other than just the crimes. That wasn't really the case here but that's hardly the fault of the film as they are different mediums.They might not have gotten the underlying meaning but they did the get the true nature of Poe accurate. His gloomy brooding obsession with death women and alcohol. I've always been convinced of John Cusack's aptitude for this role and contrary to popular belief he was very good. He was more subdued than most people were probably expecting. No action stunts and no overthetop dramatics he just showed how words and his propensity for gin would haunt him. He delivered only a few quick lines of wit and I'm assuming that was the issue people had. From all that I have read from people wanting Robert Downey Jr in this role I'm assuming they have confused the fictional character of Sherlock Holmes with the reallife writer of Poe. All that I can say to that is thank God Cusack never got confused.Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has credited Poe as inspiration for the creation of his famous detective. I'm afraid the filmmakers have tried to repay the favour and took some action cues from the recent movies.

	schema:headline " A bit too simplistic all.";
	schema:reviewBody "Well not much to say about this movie really. It's not bad but it's definitely nothing memorable or impressive to watch either. It's all being good and entertaining enough to keep watching but by the end of it you won't feel like you got an awful lot out of the movie.I think that the biggest problem of the movie is that it's being a very straightforward mysterythriller which at the same time also makes it a very standard and formulaic one. Normally I would complain when a movie has too many distractions in it but in this case it most likely wouldn't had harmed this movie. Some more character or some more different story lines would had perhaps made this movie a more interesting one.The movie now becomes a bit tiresome after a while. There is not enough variation and the movie just never really manages to become a tense one with any of its mystery or thriller elements.

There was so much they could had done after all he plays Edgar Allan Poe in this movie but it feels as if the filmmakers were holding back with just about everything and decided to play things safe making this a very standard and therefore also predictable little movie.No it's not a horrible movie to watch but just a movie that offers far too little to its viewers.610 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	onyx:emotionText "Well not much to say about this movie really. It's not bad but it's definitely nothing memorable or impressive to watch either. It's all being good and entertaining enough to keep watching but by the end of it you won't feel like you got an awful lot out of the movie.I think that the biggest problem of the movie is that it's being a very straightforward mysterythriller which at the same time also makes it a very standard and formulaic one. Normally I would complain when a movie has too many distractions in it but in this case it most likely wouldn't had harmed this movie. Some more character or some more different story lines would had perhaps made this movie a more interesting one.The movie now becomes a bit tiresome after a while. There is not enough variation and the movie just never really manages to become a tense one with any of its mystery or thriller elements. Who knows maybe it also was the movie its low budget that prevented it from ever making a real impact and the reason why the movie seems to be lacking the right required type of atmosphere.A problem of the movie also lies with its main character.

	schema:reviewBody "If only Vincent Price were still alive. Perhaps the legendary Price himself a fan of Edgar Allan Poe and who starred in many adaptations of Poe's stories could have brought the necessary combination of grand passion inner turmoil and sly wit to The Raven that it needed to succeed. But Price is of course long gone and so we must make do with John Cusack. And it just doesn't work.The Raven is based upon a great premise in 19thcentury Baltimore a sadistic killer is on the loose his murders based on the stories of the infamous poet and purveyor of the macabre Edgar Allan Poe. Poe penniless and drunk most of the time is at first a suspect in the murders but Detective Fields Luke Evans realizes that however otherwise dissolute Poe may be he is not a murderer and so enlists the writer's aid in cracking the case. The stakes are raised however when Poe's own fianc Emily Alice Eve is kidnapped. Can Fields and Poe solve the mystery of the murderer's identity in time to save Emily's life or will Poe be undone by the very fruits of his own grisly imagination? Again it's a great premise. Poe is one of the greatest horror writers of all time and a thriller based upon his lurid tales of madness and death has a lot of potential. Sadly The Ravenwhich takes its title from perhaps Poe's most famous poemnever realizes its lofty ambitions. The aforementioned John Cusack is the first problem the film is saddled with for while Cusack is a capable actor the complexities of playing the troubled rather enigmatic Edgar Allan Poe prove totally beyond him. Cusack never makes his version of Poe likable or even interesting and in many ways Evans's much more ably realized Detective Fields is the real star of the show. Alice Eve's lovely and charming performance as Emily goes for naught as her character doesn't have enough to do and is so underwritten that she lacks any real personality.The Raven does look good and there are many appealing shots of fogshrouded streets and dark forests. But the atmosphere is wasted and the elements of Poe's stories which make it into the script are misused. Familiar Poe stories like The Pit and the Pendulum and The Murders in the Rue Morgue are used for a few gory set pieces that are merely insults to the original tales which inspire them. Suspense is diluted by the inability of the director John McTeigue to decide what kind of movie he really wants to make a mystery? A thriller? A horrorcomedy? The Raven isn't solidly any of these things and so it becomes terribly boring by default.If you really want a good movie inspired by the works of Edgar Allan Poe there are a few of them out there including at least two likewise called The Raven one starring Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff  and the other featuring Vincent Price and again Boris Karloff. Though both films have entirely different stories to tell they are also both superior to the new movie in every way. Poe himself was a merciless critic. Were he alive today I think his own review of The Raven would make mine look glowing by comparison.".

I did enjoy the relationship between Poe and Fields It was interesting in the sense of the change from suspect to friend from untrusted to relying on each other.Also the art direction and Costume design. The ball where The mask of the red Death was depicted was impressive and very detailed as well as Poe's town and the killers lair. The movie is visually striking emulating historical costumes and setting but the story lack consistency. It was a wonderful and thoughtful ending to a defective and lacking plot due to failures in character developments  not counting detective fields.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is story set during the last few days in the life of Edgar Allen Poe. Poe John Cusack is a penniless drunk with a pet raccoon for some reason depending on money he gets from The Baltimore Times for writing acerbic reviews of other writers' work to keep him in the booze. Emily Alice Eve the woman he loves is difficult to reach because her father Colonel Hamilton Brendan Gleeson has a very understandable dislike of Poe so they have sneak around behind his back.The police are investigating two brutal murders of a mother and her 12 yearold daughter in a locked room. Detective Emmett Fields Luke Evans notices the parallels between these murders and the Poe story Murders in the Rue Morgue so he sends a squad of policemen out to bring Poe in for questioning. Although Fields doesn't believe Poe is responsible for the murders he is definitely connected to them.There's a second murder this time based on the story The Pit and The Pendulum and this is a pretty gory killing as you can imagine if you are aware of the story if you are not I'll just say the pendulum has an enormous blade on the end of it. The victim this time is a writer at The Baltimore Times who wrote highly negative reviews of Poe's stories. A crimson mask found on body is a message from the killer to Poe and the police about where he will strike next. The killer is playing a game with them and when the life of his beloved Emily is threatened Poe is forced to play the killer's game.This was an entertaining mystery thriller and I did like the inclusion of Poe's stories in this film. The setting felt authentic enough and there was no anachronistic steam punk stuff going on like so many other alternative history stories. The cast are reasonable enough especially Brendan Gleeson but they don't really get too much development. I don't have any doubt that Cusack's performance bore very little resemblance to the real Edgar Allen Poe but it was fun and over the top and similar to Robert Downey Juniors's take on Sherlock Holmes. Anyone expecting dark melancholia and madness will probably not like this film but for people only passingly familiar with Poe it is a mystery thriller romp with a pulpy comic book feel.Rating 710".

	schema:headline " The raving and the riven";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a clever wellmade movie but I think there are a couple of things that stop it from being better than it is.The story is not dissimilar to David Fincher's Seven in that case it was killings inspired by the seven deadly sins while in The Raven a serial killer creates gory scenarios based on the stories of Edgar Allen Poe.Inspector Emmett Fields played by Luke Evans while investigating a bizarre double murder realises that it has a connection to a story by Edgar Allen Poe. He engages the author to help him find the killer. Poe played by John Cusack is hesitant at first but soon throws himself into the hunt forming an alliance with Fields.The killer's true intentions become a little clearer when Poe's Fiance Emily played by Alice Eve is kidnapped. Kept in a coffin she is tormented by her captor. Eventually Poe works out who the killer is and strikes a deadly deal in exchange for Emily's life.I think John Cusack struggles to find the right balance for Poe. Admittedly he is more settled in the role by the end of the movie but he knocks it off balance with some early drunk scenes with lots of yelling actors portraying people who are drunk are almost as annoying as people who are drunk. His performance is uneven especially in his affection for Emily  he seems oddly unconvincing in some scenes although he says he would sacrifice his life for her. Luke Evans with a far more understated performance steals the show as Inspector Fields.Visually brilliant the film features ever more elaborate techniques to dispose of the killer's victims The ingenuity and the amount of work involved would have required a crew the size of the one that built the Panama Canal however with a movie such as this suspension of disbelief definitely helps with the enjoyment level.For a while I thought the identity of murderer was going to be either a disappointment or far too obvious simply because not too many characters are introduced into the story an unwritten rule of crime movies is that no one is introduced into a plot without reason. My fears were groundless the ending works brilliantly and is far more satisfying than is often the case.Although The Raven has similarities to Seven it doesn't have the darkness or the hidebehindyourfinger's tension of that masterpiece of horror. With that said however as serial killer movies go The Raven is definitely a 'cut' above the average.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a clever wellmade movie but I think there are a couple of things that stop it from being better than it is.The story is not dissimilar to David Fincher's Seven in that case it was killings inspired by the seven deadly sins while in The Raven a serial killer creates gory scenarios based on the stories of Edgar Allen Poe.Inspector Emmett Fields played by Luke Evans while investigating a bizarre double murder realises that it has a connection to a story by Edgar Allen Poe. He engages the author to help him find the killer. Poe played by John Cusack is hesitant at first but soon throws himself into the hunt forming an alliance with Fields.The killer's true intentions become a little clearer when Poe's Fiance Emily played by Alice Eve is kidnapped. Kept in a coffin she is tormented by her captor. Eventually Poe works out who the killer is and strikes a deadly deal in exchange for Emily's life.I think John Cusack struggles to find the right balance for Poe. Admittedly he is more settled in the role by the end of the movie but he knocks it off balance with some early drunk scenes with lots of yelling actors portraying people who are drunk are almost as annoying as people who are drunk. His performance is uneven especially in his affection for Emily  he seems oddly unconvincing in some scenes although he says he would sacrifice his life for her. Luke Evans with a far more understated performance steals the show as Inspector Fields.Visually brilliant the film features ever more elaborate techniques to dispose of the killer's victims The ingenuity and the amount of work involved would have required a crew the size of the one that built the Panama Canal however with a movie such as this suspension of disbelief definitely helps with the enjoyment level.For a while I thought the identity of murderer was going to be either a disappointment or far too obvious simply because not too many characters are introduced into the story an unwritten rule of crime movies is that no one is introduced into a plot without reason. My fears were groundless the ending works brilliantly and is far more satisfying than is often the case.Although The Raven has similarities to Seven it doesn't have the darkness or the hidebehindyourfinger's tension of that masterpiece of horror. With that said however as serial killer movies go The Raven is definitely a 'cut' above the average.";

Down on his luck  his glory days behind him Poe is seen as a belligerent and egotistical drunk.The amalgamation of truth and fiction simply does not work. Everything is thrown into the mixer from Hammer horror  to Sherlock Holmes to even Saw. Afet the 40 minute mark my mind began to wonder. Even with its serial killer emblazoned on a newspaper headline  pointed in one scene towards the camera in case you were not following copycatting Poes more famous death scenes plot the affair is strangely tension free. The identity of the killer results in a shrug of the shoulders  oh its him . Who would have guessed? I was never engaged enough to even try to guess the killers identity. If Poes death is shrouded in mystery this certainly doesn't pretend to be a viable explanation.".

The same however may not be said if you're someone like Edgar Allan Poe.And yet live his work is precisely what Poe must do in the new drama The Raven. Directed by James McTeigue V for Vendetta The Raven tells the fictitious account of the mysterious last days of famed writer and poet Edgar Allan Poe. In the film Poe John Cusack becomes the inspiration for a serial killer one who draws upon even the minutest details of the writer's short stories to stage his killings. When a team headed by a Detective Fields Luke Evans begins to hunt the killer Poe the natural expert on the recurring murders finds himself fighting for the woman he loves Alice Eve and challenged by a mastermind more disturbed than he.To this day no one really knows what caused Poe's death or what exactly occurred in the last few days he was alive and The Raven's attempt to answer those questions is admittedly quite creative. I mean what better way for the author of The TellTale Heart to go than chasing a deranged murderer? In fact screenwriters Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare ironically attempt a tactic similar to that employed in 1998's romantic comedy Shakespeare in Loveboth films try to concoct clever scenarios that might lend some insight as to what actually inspired some of the world's literary geniuses. However while The Raven tries to paint a thrilling picture of said events try is really all it manages to do. Unlike Shakespeare The Raven never succeeds in executing its tale with much intelligence neither does it do so with wit elegance or much subtlety.It's unfortunate that this film is bogged down by such a thinlycrafted script and rather messy direction because I found and actually still find the entire concept to be quite fascinating then again I've been intrigued by Poe for as long as I can remember. And considering who and what the movie is about I found it to be more silly than scary I mean I'm pretty sure I laughed during scenes and lines especially I probably wasn't supposed to and found Poe's human hearteating pet raccoon Carl far more amusing than I probably should have.To read the rest of the review IMDb form too short visit httpcustodianfilmcritic.comtheraven".

The Raven tried to capture the imagination of Tim Burton's Classic Sleepy Hallow and failed miserably. You may have slightly created the same atmosphere but The Raven was too loud too crud and too much filled with obnoxiousness of John Cusack's character.

Alice Eve tried her best to bring some humanity to the movie as a girl buried in the cascade. Luke Evens is always wasted in supporting roles I think it's about time to give him a lead role to see what he can bring to the table. On the whole it's terrible though at times time pass but way to loud to be enjoyable.".

The Raven tried to capture the imagination of Tim Burton's Classic Sleepy Hallow and failed miserably. You may have slightly created the same atmosphere but The Raven was too loud too crud and too much filled with obnoxiousness of John Cusack's character.

Alas when the closing credits finally rolled in response to my prayers to the good Lord above who also resides as a gift to the mind deep within I began to feel my empty skull slowly heal with the rapid exit of this foulsmelling memory of witnessing this sinister cinematic sin. And as I cast my eyes over to the lifeless bones of the black raven who died with his clutching claws desperately targeting the rewind button on the dusty remote I suddenly discovered a tiny handwritten note which had been tied tightly around his faint and feeble throat. It read as follows To whomever survives this torturous agony of melancholious monotony concealed within less than five evil gigabytes of diabolically conceived insanity do not forget to warn others of this wicked curse in the hopes they might avoid this treacherous calamity thrust upon the silly stage of Poeprofanity as a small stain trying to soil forever the sweet innocence of divinely evolving humanity.".

	schema:headline " Shallow and Disappointing Edgar Allan Poe Deserves Better";
	schema:reviewBody "Well here was a misfire. THE RAVEN is another one of those films where I should have listened to the critics. But come on the premise was cool and it's not often that John Cusack disappoints. Plus it was directed by James McTeigue the man behind V FOR VENDETTA. How did this turn out so poorly? I remember having read reviews for it but I never actually seeing it arrive in theaters. I guess I know why now. I don't know a whole lot about the life of Edgar Allan Poe but I do enjoy his stories. This wasn't enough to find anything to love about the movie. This is throwaway entertainment at best though entertainment might be too strong a word because I was pretty bored. The movie is a mysterythriller based around the details leading to Poe's mysterious death in 1849. Poe is a penniless alcoholic scratching for booze money from his apathetic editor who wants nothing more than another macabre tale to capture his readers' attention and money. Meanwhile Poe is courting the daughter of a powerful man with a hatred for the alcoholic vagabond. When Baltimore is haunted by a serial killer who draws his inspiration from Poe's tales the author is approached by Detective Fields to act as a consultant in hunting the murderer. Soon the investigation turns personal for Poe when his beloved Emily is taken captive and they must work against the clock following clues to find her before she becomes the killer's final victim.THE RAVEN is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Guy Ritchie's SHERLOCK HOLMES franchise. It fails. Whereas Ritchie's movies are fun exciting if loose adaptations of the source material McTeigue's movie is boring and formulaic. It just drones on from one scene to the next connecting the dots to a conclusion that I just didn't care about. I realized the reason a lot of the tension fizzles is because the movie continues to cut away from the investigation to Emily and her captivity. Maybe if we weren't constantly reminded that Emily is alive there would've have been a bit of suspense as Poe and Fields race to save her life. Will they save her? Will she die before they can stop the murderer? Oh wait there she is. Nope she's fine. Then there's the matter of the final reveal of the culprit. I'm not going to reveal their identity here for those out there who are interested in the movie but I was pretty disappointed. To be honest I didn't even recognize the person at first. I had to think back and remember if I'd seen them in the movie before that point. There are no clues or pieces for the audience to try and solve the case in their own minds it's just here's a bunch of brutal murders andhere's the killer. Surprise! The murders themselves are mildly interesting particularly the scene drawn from Poe's Pit and the Pendulum. The violence loses some of its edge due to the shoddy CG that fills out the movie. Nothing looks genuine. In 2011 Roland Emmerich used CG to create expansive shots of Elizabethan era London for his film ANONYMOUS and it worked great but McTeigue tries the same technique for 19th century Baltimore and it falls flat because it looks fake.Speaking of fake let's chat about the cast. I love Cusack but he was sorely miscast as Poe. From the very beginning he never really disappeared into the character and always came off as John Cusack as Edgar Allan Poe with a hint of Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes. As much as I enjoy Cusack I'm not sure he's the right person for any sort of period piece. Throw him back in the hot tub time machine and let someone more appropriate tackle a role like Poe. Luke Evans is Poe's partner in the investigation Detective Fields. Fields is a dull character with nothing defining about him with the exception that he's intelligent and all business. Good for him but it doesn't make for the most exciting character. Alice Eve is beautiful as Emily and Brendan Gleeson is probably the best in the cast as Captain Hamilton Emily's father and ardent Poe hater. Shallow characters in a shallow movie. That about sums up THE RAVEN. It's a forgettable experience that had a hard enough time capturing my attention while I was watching it. If you're looking for a thriller but don't really want to have to put any thought into the experience THE RAVEN might be what you want.".

	schema:headline " A Magnificent Biopic but Overwhelmingly Sad";
	schema:reviewBody "Piaf's tumultuous life receives a superb framework in this excellent biopic. I've read some criticism of Dahan's editing style which switches often to various parts of her alltoobrief life but with a woman of such roiling emotions and dramatic upheavals how could it not be so? The two things I found missing here were her WWII Resistance activities and her final marriage to a man twenty years her junior. But then again the film might have approached the three hour mark and at nearly two and a half you walk away feeling as though you witnessed a train wreck in slowmo. Please do not let this prevent you from seeing an astonishingly fine recreation of a life that is so fully lived you cannot believe it. Piaf's magnificent emotional singing is fully complemented by Cotillards balls to the wall performance. Heart and soul are in total sync here and Cotillard manages to age astonishingly well. This is a terrible tale of a child grotesquely abandoned emotionally by her parents. Piaf's will to live is inspiring even in the face of selfdestruction that makes Judy Garland's own battles with alcohol and drugs seem minor in comparison. The parallels to both women are hard to ignore. The rest of the cast is firstrate and the film beautifully evokes the eras covered in her life. Best of all there is the great Piaf recorded legacy which is wellhandled here. There's no sense that Cotillard is not singing and that's a testament to the skill that suffuses this fine film. Excellent.".

	onyx:emotionText "Piaf's tumultuous life receives a superb framework in this excellent biopic. I've read some criticism of Dahan's editing style which switches often to various parts of her alltoobrief life but with a woman of such roiling emotions and dramatic upheavals how could it not be so? The two things I found missing here were her WWII Resistance activities and her final marriage to a man twenty years her junior. But then again the film might have approached the three hour mark and at nearly two and a half you walk away feeling as though you witnessed a train wreck in slowmo. Please do not let this prevent you from seeing an astonishingly fine recreation of a life that is so fully lived you cannot believe it. Piaf's magnificent emotional singing is fully complemented by Cotillards balls to the wall performance. Heart and soul are in total sync here and Cotillard manages to age astonishingly well. This is a terrible tale of a child grotesquely abandoned emotionally by her parents. Piaf's will to live is inspiring even in the face of selfdestruction that makes Judy Garland's own battles with alcohol and drugs seem minor in comparison. The parallels to both women are hard to ignore. The rest of the cast is firstrate and the film beautifully evokes the eras covered in her life.

	schema:headline " I'm coming to the conclusion that this is the best biopic I have ever seen";
	schema:reviewBody "It is difficult to overstate the necessary calibre of a woman who was raised in a filthy whorehouse sung and slept on the street travelled with the circus lost her child at 20 went blind for a time was wrongly accused of murder struggled with a drug addiction and lost other loved ones by the bucketload in her life and still got up on stage at the end of her life to sing Je ne regrette rien. La Mme documents each stage of Edith Piaf's life with creative direction and an intense performance by its lead actress Martion Cotillard.Ultimately it is a film that curiously enough does not come down to acting or story so much as it owes everything to its direction by Olivier Dahan. Audiences have been divided thus far on his efforts as they are somewhat unorthodox but I believe he has truly done something magical with what could have fallen prey to a bythenumbers biopic approach. In La Mme the continuity is clipped and fragmentary at several points in the film with scene 2 melting into scene 1 as opposed to vice versa. The story of Edith seems to fledge itself around two or three story lines simultaneously  her youth her adulthood and her last days.Marion Cotillard a personal favourite of mine is perfect at each of the aforementioned stages having met the wonders of realistic makeup but also clearly having connected with the character of Edith Piaf. As a young singer she is fumbling and birdlike but always with raw intensity behind her performance. As an old lady although from what I understand she was never truly that old at the time of her death she has transformed into something else  a kind of loud hysterical diva who is alternatively selfdepreciative and overbearing her youthful humility having been quenched by years of alcohol abuse and her birdlike body and gait having been crippled by rheumatism. Only once does Cotillard vaguely emerge from her character and it is toward the end when Edith is sitting on a beach in California giving an interview. The rest of the film she is wholly chameleonlike and indistinguishable from la mme.Certainly this type of tragicomic drama with all of its povertystricken episodes and heartrending tragedies is primed to elicit an emotional response but Dahan goes the extra mile in polishing the story for audiences. It truly is a beautiful work of art coated with sweeping tracking shots  la Paul Thomas Anderson or Martin Scorsese blended with shakycam to capture the fast fickle pace of the business endlessly creative intercutting of continuity and breathtaking scenes after another. When Piaf's beautiful hands have been noted a muted performance is given in which the camera only focuses on her theatrics and hand gestures. Yet the best scene takes place in Piaf's apartment some 23s into the film in which she is waiting for her lover Marcel to fly in from Morocco. I shall give no spoilers. The film is momentarily gray and depressing only to jerk the audience away from the misery and lose itself in a blossomstrewn pictorial style whenever Piaf goes on stage.La Mme is a onewomanshow in all respects with Cotillard shamelessly relegating every other cast member to the background with her emotional intensity. But in all fairness supporting characters are not given much screen time in the film seemingly floating away from the central story eventually or dying in some tragedy illustrating the lonely life of its titular singer. La Mme needs to be seen to be believed for it unexpectedly floors all other musical biopics of recent years  or indeed ever.9 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite an editing style that makes a hash of conventional chronology 40yearold Dahan's biopic of Edith Piaf is a film that astonishes. Beautiful cinematography and rich though uneven miseenscene contribute with a solid supporting cast including Sophie Testud as Piaf sidekick Momone Pascal Greggory as faithful manager Louis Barrier Emmanuelle Seignier as Titine the prostitute who became her surrogate mother and Grard Depardieu as the man who first recognized the magnitude of her talent  and crowned with a spectacular lead performance by Marion Costillard that's both goforbroke and precisely accurate right down to the fingernails.La Mme Piaf the kid sparrow born dith Gassion and so renamed by Louis Leple Depardieu's character emerges as in intense suffering passionate spirit a believer in love and Saint Theresa restorer of her eyesight who exemplifies the image of the doomed artist. Things are turbulent from the start and never stop being that way. As we see the young Piaf she's abandoned by her streetsinger mother raised in a brothel almost goes blind is ripped away from her surrogate mother to tour in a circus with her father and begins to sing when accompanying him as a streetperforming contortionist. The crowd wants her to do something so she sings the Marseillaise in a simple ringing voice and a star is born. But she's not out of the gutter till fashionable cabaret owner Leple whisks her off the street and onto his stage to be discovered in turn by a composer and a radio impresario  and by then she's already a heavy drinker. Drugs and tragedy accompany the growing fame in this whirlwind tale that runs in circles.As the film shifts back and forth vertiginously between Piaf's last days at only 47! one sustained story is her love affair with French boxing champion Marcel Cerdan a handsome and appealing JeanPierre Martins that begins when both are in New York. This tender and sweet interlude in the maelstrom ends tragically when Cerdan dies in a plane crash heading back to New York see her. Piaf acts out her grief spectacularly before a full audience of friends hangerson attendants and handlers. Unlike the realistic sets of the early life the New York ones are symbolic and stagy.We see a jumble of happy moments and sad triumphs and disgrace. Some things are omitted  Piaf's actions during the Occupation her marriage late in life to a very young Greek singer. After the plane crash took away her married boxing champion lover and she was in a car accident it's suggested she was never far from the morphine needle but we're missing specifics of her drug addiction and its effects on her health. Apart Cerdan there aren't many details of her loves and marriages. We flashforward to one of many onstage collapses and a period of convalescence when the singer looks more like an old woman than a 40yearold and moves like a stuffed mummy. That last triumphant performance at Paris' grand music hall the Olympia  one of her stamping grounds in her days of fame  is cancelled even by her but then when a composer plays a new song for her Je ne regrette rien she says it's her she must rise to sing it and she's inspired to go ahead with the Olympia concert and the song what became her final anthem.Even though Dahan has said he doesn't hold to the idea that misery is a necessary ingredient of art his version of the Piaf story is never far from that commonplace romantic association. Cotillard brings the singer powerfully to life but one wishes the unremittingly tumultuous film granted Piaf a few peaceful everyday moments a quiet sitdown for a coffee and a cigarette a dinner without being drunk.Even though there are place names and dates flashed on screen to help us wade through the meandering chronology the film gives no very clear sense of the shape of the life. How much did her existence change when she became an icon? Was there any sustained period when she was famous healthy and happy all at the same time? Did she really have affairs with Aznavour Montand Marlene et al. as rumors say? The narrative had to be impressionist not linear Dahan has commented. Certainly this isn't studied analytical filmmaking but as Dahan's remarks suggests the wildly impressionistic kind. Dahan's last film was the nightmarish Crimson Rivers II his background is adventurous but not altogether distinguished. He's done music videos which may help explain the editing style. That editing is such a whirlwind  on her deathbed we go back to her childhood and moments or adult triumph with some remarkably cunning elisions between  that when the final Olympia performance of Je ne regrette rien comes we're wrung out. It is in the closing sequence leading up to this finale where the delirious editing style finally begins to make good sense but such warped chronology doesn't sustain well over two hours and twenty minutes and one wishes it had been used more sparingly early in the film so it would be more climactic at the end.La Vie en RoseLa Mome may leave one with lots of questions and a few doubts but its emotional power is supported by good sound and image. Even in its cardboard New York sequences the film is glowing and beautiful to look at. The singing is a seamless amalgam of enhanced Piaf recordings and the spoton work of voice imitator Jil Aigrot with exceptionally convincing lipsynchs done by the tireless and really remarkable Marion Cotillard. Whatever you may conclude about this overwhelming chaotic film  it really doesn't want to give you time to think  you're going to grant that Cotillard delivers one of the most remarkable star performances ever in a singerbiopic. This will make you weep.".

Marion Cotillard is superb in this role her heroine is vulnerable doomed and dignified at the same time. I don't agree with those who say her performance is melodramatic because the singer WAS very emotional and even melodramatic though in a perfectly natural way in real life too as all the biographers remark.One thing about the movie that annoyed me a little was the switches of time frames. I understand the purpose of it. During the first 15 minutes we get to see the sickly little girl then Edith Piaf's days of glory and' finally her last days when she was a tortured creature and looked like a 70year old woman. So even while living through the singer's happiest days we never forget how it would end quite soon. But sometimes these switches seem unnecessary and distracting. The other flaw is that a viewer must be wellfamiliar with the singer's biography otherwise it would be difficult for one to understand certain moments in the film. I don't have much to say about the director's masterful work honestly there is none. The director had the story of life he had the music and the haunting voice of the great singer. The latter is what makes most of the emotional impact. But I would recommend this movie sincerely Marion Cotillard's acting alone would make it worth watching and there are other beautiful things in it as well. The movie never seems too long and its last minutes are very emotional when Edith Piaf is led to the stage she can hardly walk and then she starts to sing 'No regrets' and transforms completely.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film at the French Film Festival in New York in April and the memory of it still leaves me shattered. It is a brutally candid portrayal of Edith Piaf who was known as La Mome or the Little Sparrow. She had a violent drugfilled and tragic private life making Billie Holiday look like a Catholic school girl by comparison. She was proud of being the same age as Holiday and often referred to her in conversation. Marian Cotillard is simply amazing in the role. She captures Piaf's looks perfectly and her brushes with illness as well as her fame are vividly portrayed. Gerard Depardieu makes only a brief appearance but the rest of the cast does a fine job. The more I have thought about this film the more it reminds me of 8 12 and wonder if others will see the similarities. The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 10 is that by the end the audience is completely wrung out and there seems to be a onenote aspect to it. Perhaps a bit of editing would have done the trick. In any case this is head and shoulders above most summer fare and any film or cabaret music buff will enjoy it.".

	onyx:emotionText "I saw this film at the French Film Festival in New York in April and the memory of it still leaves me shattered. It is a brutally candid portrayal of Edith Piaf who was known as La Mome or the Little Sparrow. She had a violent drugfilled and tragic private life making Billie Holiday look like a Catholic school girl by comparison. She was proud of being the same age as Holiday and often referred to her in conversation. Marian Cotillard is simply amazing in the role. She captures Piaf's looks perfectly and her brushes with illness as well as her fame are vividly portrayed. Gerard Depardieu makes only a brief appearance but the rest of the cast does a fine job.

The little symbolic moments full of grief full of such a profound sadness...I have never seen this done so well. Certain elements of the story a conversation or object are only within the lasting of the film transformed from everyday mundane stuff into everlasting symbols of affection of redemption and personal torment.You see this is the strong point of the film  it tries toand often it manages make you cry because of her tough life but at the end you are crying because of the good things that happened to her. They too are over Edith never even regrets the bad ones.The music is a whole story on its own. I've loved Piaf for some years now but alas I don't speak French and now at last I have some context to place the songs into...and it breaks me. It really does.I saw the movie yesterday went home and listened to Edith's albums for hours and they meant so much...they spoke volumes.Anyway the direction is perfect although there is one scene towards the end which has problems  it tells for the very first time of a rather important event in the much earlier years of the singer's life  and the event in question seems to be out of place sort of neglected  as if it should have been dealt with an hour earlier. But this is only one tiny scene and even it in itself is masterfully done. Everything else is flawless.The cuts and the singing are blended brilliantly together. I was especially struck which is strange by the end credits they are very unusual and touching for a movie which is this musical find out why!.Anyway my deepest recommendations. See it it is really excellent. It is dark and human and bright and full of spectacular music.It is the 20th century.I fell in love with it.You might too.".

Piaf's scattered memories are just what the film examines as she starts to dissect and remember fragmented moments in her life and sometimes in life characters relationships lost loved ones are suddenly shifted and gone from one's perspective without any notice. The use of just the right amount of music was done superbly as to not just make this a concert type musical biography but an exciting joy ride through an era long since past.

	schema:reviewBody "Edith Piaf's story brings to mind the tragedy of Judy Garland in some ways her American counterpart  a freakishly talented girl with severe emotional problems who was plucked from obscurity by perceptive and farsighted mentors and transformed into a great artist before selfdestructing under the pressures and imbalances inherent in superstardom.This film is the second attempt in the last 20odd years to tell the story of the amazing Edith Piaf. The earlier attempt was a poorly received play by British playwright Pam Gems. From what I heard it was sketchy and without depth and didn't do very well on the boards either in the UK or the USA but the lead actress was highly praised. Now we have another attempt this time on film which is also panned for being sketchy and without depth but worth seeing because of an outstanding lead performance this time by Marion Cotillard.I agree with most of the other commentators that the script by Olivier Dahan and Isobel Sobelman if there even was a full script and Dahan's direction are messy and confusing as if the director wanted to emulate the Baz Luhrman touch by creating a 10ring circus. I wouldn't be surprised to discover that Dahan scribbled ideas on index cards threw them up in the air and then picked them up randomly stacked them on a table and said Let's shoot the film in this order. The producers of this train wreck wisely hired very talented actors costume designers set builders and camera people. I think the French are worldclass experts in these departments. Most French period films look right down to the lighting.The challenge of making a film biography of Piaf is that she was so extraordinary and she lived such an eventful life during historically volatile times. How to tell it all without succumbing to the episodic TVmovie style is something that should be handed over to only the most skilled screenwriter. Dahan is not that person His direction of individual scenes isn't so bad. It's the context in which they are presented and the confusing script that weakens the film. It is hard to tell whether the editing jumped back and forth and sideways in order to conceal the essential weakness of the material or if the zigzagging was intended from the outset perhaps to mirror the chaos of Piaf's lifestyle. But if so WHY? Why make bad scrambled eggs when you could have made a great omelet?Marion Cotillard fulfills all of the demands of this role as dictated by this diffuse script. Nothing she does is lukewarm or halfhearted. But what she is required to do is suspect. Surely Piaf was no beauty toward the end but she certainly didn't look like a mangled crone out of Fellini's SATYRICON. But amidst this mess I was actually moved especially during the buildup period when she is first seen singing on the streets to an appreciative audience of passersby or the way one of her mentors strictly coaches her to be the best she can be by improving her stage posture and enunciation or her rapturous reaction to a new song played for her by composers inspired by her artistry as if she lives for such beauty. Those scenes were going in the right direction.It is not even so bad that certain aspects of her life are reduced to brief telegraphic scenes such as the moment when she meets Marlene Dietrich played very well and authentically by Caroline Sihol. Too bad there couldn't have been more of this relationship in the film. I'd have happily sacrificed about half of the footage devoted to her sappy involvement with the boxer for another scene or two with Dietrich whom she knew very well for several years.The total absence of World War Two from the story is baffling. Surely her experiences performing for prisoners of war and her work in the Resistance and her devious methods of dealing with the Nazi occupiers would have brought out fascinating elements of her character and made for rousing and suspenseful scenes. Again this omission speaks of a randomness at the conceptual level.The religious element is played up from beginning to end. As a little girl she devoutly prays to St. Theresa. As a grown woman she treasures the cross that she wears around her neck. When she meets certain people like Dietrich or her boxer lover the expression of adoration on her face is the same as that of the little girl praying to her saint. It's all effective but presented as one of many fragments unconnected to the other fragments.By the end you are more grateful that it's over than you are to have experienced this unique performer and that's really sad.".

Marion Cotillard's performance in her role as Edith Piaf was technically proficient but somewhat cold and enigmatic. At first I interpreted this approach to be a reflection of the character perhaps in life Ms. Piaf was a cipher to those around her cold and distant. The dialog direction and film editing with its constant flashbacks and flash forwards reinforce this interpretation. But the opposite is true. The details of her life after her discovery as a singer are well documented and her life itself was a passionate if tragic one. Thus we are left to determine whether the obvious deficiencies in the movie are those of the actor the writers the director who cowrote or all three. I cannot sort it out and so must fault all involved. Meaty female leading roles of the sort tackled here by Ms. Cotillard are rare indeed and her performance in showcasing Pilaf's life from young woman to a prematurely aged wreck she was only 48 when she died of liver failure but if the movie is to be believed she looked to be at least 30 years older has its wow moments. But the whole is less than the parts. The character doesn't develop over the course of the movie nor is insight into her life provided through either the writing direction or performance. Her death and many significant facts of her life are purposely obscured or shrouded in mysteryto an unnecessary degree. The most significant of these failures are her activities during the German occupation during World War II. One would think this period rather than the tedious postWar period of physical decline and drug abuse would have deserved at least some treatment. I suspect it is because this period of her life is a controversial one. Was she a Nazi collaborator and traitor or a secret member of the French Resistance? To the writers and director of 'La Mome' the years 19401945 never happened despite the fact that the song that inspired the alternative title to this film 'La Vie En Rose' was authored and released in 1945. So what is to be made of this movie? As an artistic work I believe it is a failure for it shrinks from dealing with any of the significant issues of Piaf's time that speak to ours. From a technical perspective the art direction the ensemble performances the music and the cinematography are first rate.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before this movie was screened yesterday the director Olivier Dahan was introduced to the audience. His appearance was as undistinguished as his CV which consists mainly of music videos and Purple Rivers II in short a forty year old apparently doing his damnedest to eclipse Pete Doherty as a tragic joke. My initial reaction  which he gave me no reason to change  was 'what a tt'. Just for a split second I wondered if the word of mouth was perhaps wrong how could someone who looked and behaved like a refugee from the Betty Ford Clinic make even a halfdecent movie.The answer is Marion Cotillard. She takes the film by the scruff of the neck and transcends the inept Direction. Forget the Oscar the Cesar the Bafta Golden Globe they're going to have to CREATE a new Award for this performance. A girl I know in Paris saw this when it was released there on Valentine's Day and wrote me that 'Cotillard doesn't play Piaf she IS Piaf'. How right she was Cotillard is Piaf in the same way that Gloria Swanson WAS Norma Desmond in a way that Larry Parks was NOT Jolson or Cary Grant was NOT Cole Porter or coming nearer to home Fanny Ardant was not QUITE Maria Callas.The thing is I've never been much of a Piaf fan I could take her or leave her but Cotillard makes it crystal clear just who and what Piaf WAS a oneoff an incredible talent with a private life that sucked. One of a triumvirate if you will with Judy Garland and Billie Holiday. They had a shot at Lady Day and it was an honorable shot but light years short of what Cotillard brings to La Mome.

	onyx:emotionText "Before this movie was screened yesterday the director Olivier Dahan was introduced to the audience. His appearance was as undistinguished as his CV which consists mainly of music videos and Purple Rivers II in short a forty year old apparently doing his damnedest to eclipse Pete Doherty as a tragic joke. My initial reaction  which he gave me no reason to change  was 'what a tt'. Just for a split second I wondered if the word of mouth was perhaps wrong how could someone who looked and behaved like a refugee from the Betty Ford Clinic make even a halfdecent movie.The answer is Marion Cotillard. She takes the film by the scruff of the neck and transcends the inept Direction. Forget the Oscar the Cesar the Bafta Golden Globe they're going to have to CREATE a new Award for this performance. A girl I know in Paris saw this when it was released there on Valentine's Day and wrote me that 'Cotillard doesn't play Piaf she IS Piaf'. How right she was Cotillard is Piaf in the same way that Gloria Swanson WAS Norma Desmond in a way that Larry Parks was NOT Jolson or Cary Grant was NOT Cole Porter or coming nearer to home Fanny Ardant was not QUITE Maria Callas.The thing is I've never been much of a Piaf fan I could take her or leave her but Cotillard makes it crystal clear just who and what Piaf WAS a oneoff an incredible talent with a private life that sucked. One of a triumvirate if you will with Judy Garland and Billie Holiday. They had a shot at Lady Day and it was an honorable shot but light years short of what Cotillard brings to La Mome. If they ever find an actress who can BE Judy Garland as Cotillard is Edith Piaf the result will be a movie to die for. Chronology is perhaps the wrong word to describe what at times resembles one Magic Mushroom too many and anyone unfamiliar with Piaf's life will be better not attempting to negotiate the labyrinth but just wallow in Cotillard's artistry.

	schema:headline " A French afternoon in New York";
	schema:reviewBody "Before getting to the review of this astonishing film let me tell you about how I came to see it. On my way back to the UK from Indiana last week I had a seven hour layover in Newark. I don't much enjoy hanging around airports for hours so I took the 30 minute train ride into Manhattan. Wandering up the road from Maddison Square Gardens I heard a smartsuited African speaking French into his 'cellulaire'. Wondering if he was from Cte d'Ivoire where we used to live I followed him through a shop doorway. As my eyes adjusted to the rather greasy gloom I noted that I had entered a little Caribbean bakeryrestaurant full of black faces. I suppressed the desire to make a quick exit and joined him at the back of the queue at the counter. He turned out to be Senegalese rather than Ivorian but was very pleased to have another chance to talk French...After a very tasty 7 lunch of 'stew chicken with rice  beans' and a portion of fried plantains I headed on up 8th Avenue. A few blocks further on I came to a cinema and decided that it would be great to see a 'movie' on a real big screen rather than the way I see most films these days through the distinctly lowdef screen built into the back of the airline seat in front of me.I was just in time to buy tickets for La Vie en Rose which was starting right away. Entering the big 'movie theater' I was shocked that at four on a Wednesday afternoon the place was packed solid. As my eyes adjusted and hunted for an empty seat I observed that I was once again the stranger  almost everyone there appeared to be over sixty. Perhaps it was the cheap day for seniors or the fact that La Vie en Rose had only opened a few days earlier but the film definitely merits a large audience.Perhaps you are put off by foreign language films with subtitles but to have dubbed this from French would have been a crime. It is a biopic of the life of Edith Piaf whose theme song was La Vie en Rose  literally 'Life in Pink' or more idiomatically 'The Rosetinted Life'. Edith Piaf's gravelly voice and melodramatic life is superbly portrayed by Marion Cotillard as the film works its way through her life to the accompaniment of her distinctive songs. Of course as in all French films which make it to the anglophone world there is a role for THE French Actor as we often refer to Gerard Depardieu he is the impresario who literally discovers 'the Little Sparrow' singing in the backstreets of Montmartre.It was quite a puzzle to place each scene in chronological order as the film jumps around through more flashbacks and flash forwards than an entire season of Lost. Apart from that though La Vie en Rose is an absolute triumph rich with the colours of Piaf's tragic life. The entire audience stuffed damp handkerchiefs into their pockets rose to their feet and applauded this guaranteed Oscar winner. Piaf finished her career singing a song which she felt summed up her life  Non je ne regrette rien! Take your friends to see this classic film and you'll have no regrets either.".

The commentators insist that constant flashbacks in the film produce a rather confusing effect on the spectator. And it is true. One of IMDS's commentators exclaims  Why this anarchic presentation? Ask the Director only he knows the answer. May be I guess why. The Director wanted to produce the maximal emotional effect on the spectator but he was not sure enough of himself. He was afraid that if he narrates the Piaf's biography simply in chronological manner he risks annoying the spectator. For example an important part of the film is devoted to the decrepitude of singer in her last years. If it were narrated just chronologically it may produce a rather depressing effect on the spectator. But a flashback to her flamboyant youth at this moment produces just that emotional shock that the Director has intended to create. And it works!

	schema:headline " Marion is spectacular but the film is needlessly melodramatic";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm glad I went to see LA MOME or LA VIE EN ROSE. I had a good time at the movies. After seeing it I realized what a good life I have. But seriously Marion Cotillard's performance is nothing short of spectacular even if her performance borders on caricature. I realized that whatever Cotillard and the director were attempting to do it was worth it and that includes the borderline caricatural acting. The only thing I thought went overboard was the melodrama. Edith Piaf's life is filled with tragedy. We are well aware of this but the filmmaker didn't need to dwell on it ad nauseam. Practically every scene in LA VIE EN ROSE is taken from the big book of melodrama.It's hard to believe Edith didn't have one happy moment during her days as either a kid or a young adult. After 45 minutes of nonstop sadness the film was laying it pretty thick. The best example of this was when Edith and her friend were eating at a restaurant. It was the first time we saw Edith eating a meal in a restaurant as a young woman. Just showing her enjoying her meal and chatting with her friend would have been fun to see but then Edith's estranged mother walks in begging for food and money from her daughter and well here we go again more melodrama. The film needed more quiet moments to balance out Edith's albeit tragic life. The constant melo was at times off putting. Edith's life is remarkable enough without having to rely on easy melodrama to tell it. The end effect was like the director wanted to impress younger generations who are unfamiliar with Edith by showing her life as being more edgy than Courtney Love's life could ever be.At the theater where I saw it an old couple in front of me walked out halfway into the picture visibly not pleased with the bleak representation of the beloved chanteuse. The director was obviously in love with the concept that great art emerges from tragedypainsuffering but he carried this concept to an unfortunate level.My other critique of LA VIE EN ROSE is that the script forgot major aspects about her life. Of course they couldn't cover every aspect of her legendary life but forgetting to mention that Edith was the one who discovered Yves Montand or that she played a major part of the French Resistance was inexcusable. I understand that they wanted to create a specific portrait of her life. Making a biography is not easy thing to do. It can easily fall into two categories it can be an exact academic portrayal of her life which many find tedious and dull or it could have been a wildly inaccurate portrayal made with many dramatic licenses in order to be more entertaining. But in either case an accurate truthful portrayal of anyone's life is an impossibility and the director of LA VIE EN ROSE is conscious of this and deliberately avoided some things about Edith which would have conflicted with this portrait he wanted to create but the fact that Yves Montand didn't even figure somewhere in this portrait was imo very bizarre.This brings another point the film is so focused on Edith that all other characters are pushed in the background and we hardly know who they are. Edith's star is so bright that she eclipses everyone around her. This part didn't bother me that much because I realized the director wanted to focus only on Edith but it would have been nice to have known who was who.But even with these weak points I still recommend LA VIE EN ROSE. It's the type of film we rarely see these days big showy and remarkably depressing. Marion Cotillard should win awards after awards for her stunning portrayal. It's truly something to witness and it's worth the price of admission. And the music of course is great.".

It's not a big reveal or unlocks anything that we've seen all film it seems cheap that such a particular tragedy would be deliberately hidden until near the end and then treated as a throwaway reference.

Using flashbacks nonlinear disjointed scenes would require more skill not less to portray facts of the main character's personality more effectively  a skill that is sadly even wholly lacking in this film.";

	schema:headline " Excellent performance!";
	schema:reviewBody "Marion Cotillard is astounding in this film! I am not easy to please as I used to perform as a Piaf impersonator so Piaf's life and music are very close to my heart but I found Cotillard utterly convincing. She really brings out Piaf's combination of vulnerability and bloodyminded determination as well as her fiery temperament. I spent most of the film in tears but that's because I'm too soppy for my own good! I knew Piaf's lifestory well but I still found the structure of the film and the way it leaps about in time a little confusing. It's true that it was difficult to understand Piaf's relationship with her friends and that Theo Sarapo was left out of the story. Apart from one line when Edith asks for him on her death bed he doesn't feature even though as her last husband he looked after her and significantly improved her final years. They even performed duets together eg. 'A quoi ca sert l'amour?' and this was totally left out of the story. There were a lot of scenes of Edith in Grasse looking frail and close to death. Would it have been so difficult to include a scene with Theo? The story about Marcelle seemed like a bit of an afterthought too. To be honest I would have preferred a more chronological approach to Edith's life but I still thoroughly enjoyed the film and I can't praise Cotillard's performance enough. The other actors were also excellent. Despite by criticisms it is still a mustsee!".

	schema:headline " A spectacular mess";
	schema:reviewBody "Take this down.Edith Piaf 19151963 born Edith Giovanna Gassion to a former caf singer and a street acrobat. Abandoned by her parents she lived for a time in a brothel run by her paternal grandmother. From three to seven years old she allegedly went blind as a result of meningitis but later recovered her sight after going on a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Therese. At 14 she joined her father in street performances during which she sang in public for the first time.She later went her own way as a street singer along with her halfsister Simone Berteaut nicknamed Momone. In 1935 she was discovered by nightclub owner Louis Leplee who gave her the nickname La Mome Piaf the little sparrow. Her career was momentarily derailed after Leplee was murdered allegedly by gangsters she had previous ties with. To save her career she turned to Raymond Asso who gave her the stage name Edith Piaf and commissioned Marguerite Monnot to write songs for her. Monnot became a lifelong friend and collaborator.During this period she rose to prominence as one of France's most popular entertainer and toured all over the world. However she initially met with little success in the US until a glowing review by a prominent New York critic launched her to fame in America. Her greatest performances were at the Paris Olympia concert hall the most famous venue in Paris.The great love of her life was the heavyweight world champion Marcel Cerdan who was a legend in France in his own right. After a car crash in 1951 she became addicted to morphine and alcohol two addictions she could never shake for the remaining years of her life. She died at 47 of liver cancer. Did you get that? Good because unless you're from France you'll need all the above information to make heads or tails of La Mme aka La Vie en Rose a movie about the life of Edith Piaf. The film pingpongs in a roughly chronological fashion from her early years to her later years with little narrative logic or thematic sense. One problem I have with the film is that it assumes that you already know all about Piaf's life and are watching the film simply to see recreations of key moments in her life  a sort of greatest hits if you will. Or maybe a Behind the Music special. Watching La Mme you would never understand what made Edith Piaf a French icon. Which leads to my major problem with the film the filmmakers seem determined to present Edith Piaf in the most unflattering light possible. Quite apart from her extraordinary voice what you would learn about her from La Mme is that she is an alcoholic and a junkie a spoiled arrogant diva and a homewrecker. She was also unfortunately quite ugly a fact that Piaf herself readily acknowledges in the film. By the time she was in her forties the film portrays her as looking easily twenty years older with a ravaged face and an old woman's stoop. Did the woman have no redeeming qualities whatsoever?Marion Cotillard really deserves some kind of an award for not downplaying the ugly qualities of this supremely unpleasant figure. Unfortunately the filmmakers also seem determined to cut anything resembling a performance from this film. Quite apart from the physical impersonation there is nothing to Cotillard's performance that would tell you anything about Piaf's character.The best parts of the film are those involving Piaf's early life which have all the fascination of a Dickens novel. But once Cotillard takes over as the adult Piaf watch out the film starts to make little sense. There are even some puzzling artistic choices such as the decision to play a key concert scene without vocals backed only by the score. Even worse the scene is further reduced to a series of quick closeups of Piaf's lips and hands intercut with shots of the audience reaction.If you have to watch the film make sure you read up on Piaf first before you go. Oh and enjoy the songs which are mainly actual recordings of Piaf herself. They're really the only reason to watch La Mme.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is certainly worth viewing if only for the magnificent performance of its star Marion Cotillard. Resembling Piaf physically and miming perfectly the words to the voice of the star an accent similar to that of Piaf even if it is a little over exaggerated at times there is little to be reproached concerning her performance. The structure of the film is another kettle of fish and it should be stated that a prior knowledge of Piaf's biography is INDISPENSABLE before seeing this film otherwise you will be totally confused. Unfortunately Piaf's life has not been processed like a proper biography with a beginning and an end like in the film Bernadette or Louis Pasteur for example. The film is a selection of scenes from her life assembled higgledypiggledy without any sort of order or structure so whereas each episode is extremely moving and well done the whole does not come across as an organised and structured biography. Why this anarchic presentation ? Ask the Director only he knows the answer. Certain episodes of Piaf's life such as that of her final husband Theo Sarapo are eclipsed completely. We catch a fleeting glimpse of Charles Aznavour and don't even see Yves Montand. The episode with Marcel Cerdan was as is to be expected the most emotional and well done and the actor playing Cerdan was indeed a handsome man so we can understand Piaf's emotion. But even here there is a certain confusion. On the night where his plane crashed we see him albeit for a short while enter Piafs bedroom and she prepares him coffee then we are suddenly given to understand that this was all some sort of illusion and we see all her friends with terrified faces unable to inform her of the tragedy that has occurred. This is very clumsy on the part of the director and many people watching the film with me were stumped by this. There seems also to be excessive time spent on Piaf's travel in California. On the other hand we get a good dose of Raymond Asso but little of Michel Emer and Charles Dumont. We see very little of the Bonnel family but have more than ample doses of Simone Bertheaut  dite Momone  The character Titine at the beginning would appear to have been invented for the film !. So basically there are all sorts of deficiencies in the structure of the film. I would suggest reading Piaf's biography BEFORE seeing it the book Piaf by Joelle Montserrat is very good as it also gives insight into each of her songs as well as the large number of people intervening in her life. Depardieu is of course excellent as Louis Leple but his part is necessarily short. But if there is one thing outstanding about this film it is Marion Cotillard's performance. Let me assure you that you will not exit the film emotionally intact and that is something few films do nowadays !".

During WWII France was occupied by the Germans and just as in Iraq today the occupying forces thought they and the citizens who worked with them were the good guys.

She was accused of collaborating and she did sing for the Germans in their clubs. After the war just as the majority of Germans claimed to have been antiNazi the population claiming to have been members of the French Resistance grew to a point where you wonder how France ever fell to the Germans and how they managed to deport so many French Jews. Edith Piaf claimed to have been secretly working for the Resistance but this has not been verified. Whether or not she was a collaborator or a Resistance member should have been addressed in the film. Instead the narrative took a giant leap forward from 1940 to 1947.The other fault was that the subtitling did not include a translation of her songs. As Piaf died over 40 years ago she is not known to many people under the age of 60 and even they don't all speak French. If you are going to have subtitles for the dialogue there should also be a translation of the songs which were very much a part of her story especially the final ending where she sang je ne regrette rien  I have no regrets! This was akin to making a foreign language film about Vera Lynn without letting the audience know the words of her immortal inspiring songs of WWII.".

	schema:headline " An Homage to a Great Singer but not enough for a great movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Marion was wonderful portraying a clearly unbalanced and self destructive artist. And how she lipsync'd that perfectly was truly amazing. It really brought Edith's music to life.However the issues I had with the movie were threefold 1. Just about everybody in her life as portrayed by the movie seem to have her best interest at heart everyone from the small town prostitutes to the managers and servants who nursed her at the end. Which begs the question if everyone in Edith Piaf's life showed her such kindness why did she end up such a mess? Marcel Cerdan the love of her life was portrayed as a heart throb with only love and patience in his soul. My recollection and this was passed down to me by my parents was that theirs was a tumultuous relationship. If that's the case why not give it the honest portrayal it deserved? In the constellation of her life there had to be devils the ones that abused manipulated and violated her trust driving her to the edge of insanity and addiction. That would have been drama.2. I realized early on in the movie that the director had to have made the assumption that anyone watching was well aware on who these people were. Consequently characters would drop in and out like so many distant relatives who had no need for introduction.3. I like the time shifts one finds in such classics like Citizen Kane. It fleshes out the story so that by the end we have traveled the path of life with the heroine. But we have to remain anchored in the present so that we always have a feel as to where we are in the story line. In this movie there may have been a bit too much movement away from the core and not necessarily coming back to the same point. By the end I couldn't tell if she was in Paris New York on her death bed or getting ready for her last concert.It is a movie worth seeing. For anyone who knows little about Piaf it will give them a feel for this french icon second only to the Eiffel Tower and Napoleon. But she lived a tragic life this movie only makes it seem sad.".

	onyx:emotionText "Marion was wonderful portraying a clearly unbalanced and self destructive artist. And how she lipsync'd that perfectly was truly amazing. It really brought Edith's music to life.However the issues I had with the movie were threefold 1. Just about everybody in her life as portrayed by the movie seem to have her best interest at heart everyone from the small town prostitutes to the managers and servants who nursed her at the end. Which begs the question if everyone in Edith Piaf's life showed her such kindness why did she end up such a mess? Marcel Cerdan the love of her life was portrayed as a heart throb with only love and patience in his soul. My recollection and this was passed down to me by my parents was that theirs was a tumultuous relationship. If that's the case why not give it the honest portrayal it deserved? In the constellation of her life there had to be devils the ones that abused manipulated and violated her trust driving her to the edge of insanity and addiction. That would have been drama.2. I realized early on in the movie that the director had to have made the assumption that anyone watching was well aware on who these people were. Consequently characters would drop in and out like so many distant relatives who had no need for introduction.3. I like the time shifts one finds in such classics like Citizen Kane. It fleshes out the story so that by the end we have traveled the path of life with the heroine. But we have to remain anchored in the present so that we always have a feel as to where we are in the story line. In this movie there may have been a bit too much movement away from the core and not necessarily coming back to the same point. By the end I couldn't tell if she was in Paris New York on her death bed or getting ready for her last concert.It is a movie worth seeing.

	schema:reviewBody "The year is 1701 the setting Japan. In a relatively peaceful time a reception held for envoys of the emperor ends in a confrontation between two lords which in turn would become the catalyst for one of the most famous stories of Japanese history. A story so famous it reaches mythical proportions and is widely regarded as Japan's national legend.The 47 Ronin 1994 is one of the many celluloid retellings of this famous story. Directed by master director Kon Ichikawa 47 Ronin is basically a revamp of late 60's Japanese Samurai Cinema. Considering that Ichikawa made most of his greatest films in this time period or before the style of this film is going to be a foregone conclusion for those familiar with the director.As with most films of the genre 47 Ronin is not an action film most of the films time is devoted to the character development of Oishi Kuranosuke expertly played by Ken Takakura a chamberlain of the AkoAsano Clan who loses his master to Seppuku. The Asano Lord was forced to commit suicide because of his provoked attack on Lord Kira during the reception for the envoys. In the aftermath Oishi disbands the clan publicly and at the same time recruits a crew of 47 samurai. They patiently prepare their plans for a year and a half and then storm the fortress of Lord Kira in a mission thatsucceed or fail will ultimately end in their deaths.Kon Ichikawa leisurely unfolds his version of this classic with beautiful cinematographyintricate setpieces and detailed wardrobes. Kon's shots of autumn trees and winter pagodas are breathtaking and his perfectly framed shots work hand in hand with the highly detailed sets and costumes. Particularly the AkoAsano's black and white battle armor is truly fearsome looking.The action is characteristic of 60's Jidai Geki films opponents square off one or two strikes are exchanged the kill shot and the the obligatory geyser of blood. Although 47 Ronin is a bloody film it's not as bad as some of the more exploitational samurai films of the early 70's such as the Lone Wolf series. And though the films action sequences are sparse when they finally happen they are expertly directed and choreographed and are sure to please fans of the genre.Although this is a great film in terms of plot cinematography acting and action. I have to say that the films slow plotting tends to drag in spots and the films narration tends to get annoying after awhile. Plus the constant jumps in location tend to get a little confusing. I urge anyone interested in this film to read a little of the history behind it as this will save the viewer from being confused by the story.Bottom Line 47 Ronin should be seen for Ichikawa's expert direction and cinematography. It does tend to bog down at points but fans of samurai flicks will find delight in this film.".

In style and content this is clearly a children's fantasy and yet it isn't.Remarkably Miyazaki has yet again achieved what he created in Totoro a film that draws the viewer indelibly into the world of children reminding us of the time when every discovery was unique every possession precious and the agony of loss crouched behind every wellmeaning mistake. Perhaps this is why the film has appealed more to adults than to children in Japan children still live in this world.

He is intelligent yet careless deeply conscientious but distracted by impulse.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea";
	schema:reviewBody "Hayao Miyazaki's magic continues with this absolute crowd pleaser Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea his latest animated film which turns on the usual sweetness to charm your socks off. I thought that the trailer featured its song which was quietly hypnotic and I didn't have to wait for an invite to make sure I got my ticket for the sneak preview of the movie scheduled to open here next week.For fans of Studio Ghibli films you'll probably know what you're in for as Miyazaki has yet another winner in his filmography that will win new fans over. I'm embarrassed to say the least that I've so far watched only My Neighbour Totoro eyes that pile of Ghibli DVDs and love it to bits but I guess this would serve as a final push for me not to continue missing what would likely be animated films that I would enjoy.Ponyo voiced by Nara Yuria is a magic goldfish that yearns to know what is life beyond the sea with her constant forays in a bubble to the surface of the water to sneak a peek. Nonetheless these ambitions do not bode well with her humanoid dad Fujimoto Tokoro Joji who harbours some hatred toward the human race for pollution and briefly touching a subplot on environmental protection  revenge by Mother Nature as well. An accident one day sees Ponyo being washed ashore and picked up by five year old boy Sosuke Doi Hiroki who lives on a house on the said cliff with his mother Lisa Yamaguchi Tomoko while dad Koichi Nagashima Kazushige is mostly out to sea since he's a sailor. And you can expect some moments of throwback to the likes of The Little Mermaid or Splash made for kids. Saying anything more would be to spoil the fun.The artwork here is still simply astounding even though it's in 2D glory knowing that each cell is painstakingly worked on. There are so many things going on at the same time within the same frame that you'll probably be game for repeated viewings just to spot them all. This definitely beats any 3D or CG animated production any day given its beauty coming from its simplicity and not only from the artwork department but on its story too despite complaints coming in that it took a leaf from the Hans Christian Andersen classic. While there are avenues to make this film extremely dark it only suggested certain dark themes but opted instead for a film with more positive emotions suitable for both kids and adults alike.At its core its about love that between the family members of Koichi Lisa and Sosuke and especially between mother and son. More so it's about the love between the boy and his new pet fish which he christened Ponyo and I tell you Ponyo herself has enough cuteness in her to beat the likes of Bolt WallE and Eve all hands down. Characterization here is top notch and it's hard not to fall in love with Ponyo in whichever form adopted especially when she's such a playful being who doesn't hide her emotions  if she's upset with you either she turns away or you could expect a jet stream come spewing from her mouth into your face!Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is a definite shooin to my top films of this year without hesitation. And the next time I go to Tokyo I'm sure as hell going to make my way to the Ghibli Museum to bask under the magical world brought to us by Hayao Miyazaki. Highly recommended film so don't you go missing this on the big screen!".

	schema:headline " Another Classic Miyazaki";
	schema:reviewBody "Whenever Hayao Miyazaki does the trifecta writes directs and animates a movie he makes a classic film for the ages. He has done it again with Gake no ue no Ponyo.The story is about a girl fish who is kept on a very tight leash along with her younger sisters by her father a bitter exhuman wizard named Fujimoto. The fish escapes from her father and rides a jellyfish to shore where she is caught up in a dredging operation and finds herself stuck in a bottle. This underwater sequence must be one of the most elaborately drawn animated scenes ever undertaken and stands on its own as a reason to search out the theatrical release. Miyazaki who shows no fear of having a busy scene has outdone himself. There were literally hundreds of individuallydrawn sea creatures of every imaginable size all in motion at the same time.When the fish escapes the dredging operation while still trapped in the bottle a fiveyear old boy named Sousuke spots her in the water and is able to break the bottle saving her. Since she is the result of her father's magic she is capable of magic herselfand her father actively tries to retrieve her. The boy names the fish Ponyo. Just when Sousuke learns that Ponyo can speak her father successfully retrieves her back into captivity.After a war of wills with her father Ponyo manages to escape again with the ability to change herself into a human. She meets up again with Sousuke in a storm and the story continues from there in many interesting ways. There is a cuteness factor in this film rivaling and arguably surpassing that of Tonari no Totoro. Joe Hisaishi once again provided outstanding musical support.The story itself is simpleas are Miyazaki's films in generaland should appeal to a broad spectrum of viewers. While I haven't viewed it enough to be sure the film doesn't seem to be one which will keep scholars in long discussions as Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi did. Nonetheless this is the ultimate feelgood entertainment movie. I gave the movie a ten out of ten rating.".

If you've never seen a Miyazaki film before then it will probably confuse the heck out of you. If you have seen a Miyazaki film before then it will still probably confuse the heck out of you....but you won't really care! That's because I found that the first time I saw one of his animated films I tried too hard to figure out what was happening and whyand it impacted my enjoyment of the film. Now that I have seen just about every Miyazaki film I see the bizarreness and just take it all inenjoying the beauty of it all. In many ways these films at least to Western audiences is like drugslots of strange and beautiful images that don't always initially make sense but sure feel great to see!! Of all the Miyazaki films this might have the most unusual and incomprehensible story lineeven more so than SPIRITED AWAY and PRINCESS MONONOKE or MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO. But like these and many other Studio Gibli films if you just sit back and watch you are rewarded with a fabulous tale. But because it is so hard to describe and others have already done so I won't even go there.As for the artwork it's very typical of one of these Japanese films though there was one noticeable change. There was a very extensive use of what looked like colored pencils for the backgrounds. This was NOT a bad thing at allthe lovely pastellike look was very pleasing and unique. In some ways it looked like a tiny bit of Bill Plympton's art style was infused into a typical Miyazaki film. With a high framerate exceptional character animation which imbued them with tons of personality and a great wowfactor this is an exceptional film for all ages. Though clearly designed more for younger audiences the TOTORO fans especially it is a bit scary here and there during the storm segments but there is plenty of great stuff for adults. As an adult at least chronologically so I loved the cute stuff and applaud the otherworldliness of the film.A great filmamong Miyazaki's best. I don't give it a 10 because I am hesitant to ever do thatplus I did like a few of the studio's other films a bit more particularly TOTORO. But that DOESN'T mean you shouldn't rush out now and see itdo it and do yourself a favor.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili Gake No Ue No Ponyo Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood. At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by DisneyPixar's CGI masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories. The story revolves around the friendship between a magical sea spritegoldfish and the human child that she encounters during a curious outing to see the human world. The human child Sosuke Doi Hiroki lives in a small house on a cliff overlooking a small port city in Southern Japan based on Seto Island where he lives with his young mom Lisa Yamaguchi Tomoko. Sosuke names the strange goldfish Ponyo and takes it to the daycarenursing center that Lisa works at. Ponyo is definitely not your typical goldfish and soon begins to adapt and take on human aspects she develops human speech and an appetite for ham meat by sampling some blood from a cut on Sosuke's finger. Yet just as Sosuke and Ponyo begin to develop a bond Ponyo is taken back by her father Fujimoto Tokoro Joji who is a former human who has rejected the surface world and is now attempting to collect and develop magical elixirs taken from the sea that aid him in repairing and rejuvenating the world's oceans.Ponyo's desire to become human has become so strong however that Fujimoto is unable to contain her anymore and she takes on a more human appearance and breaks free from her water world home and goes back to see Sosuke. During her breakout Ponyo unintentionally releases Fujimoto's cache of magical elixirs which unleashes all sorts of magical sea creatures that causes a violent storm in the seas surrounding Sosuke's town. Desperate to resolve Ponyo's rebellion he soon calls upon the help of his beautiful wife Ponyo's mother  the water elemental MotherLady of the Sea Amami Yuki. As with his past films Miyazaki's Gake No Ue No Ponyo touches upon various themes of ecology and environmentalism this time focusing on the health and vitality of the world's oceans. The opening sequence is at times sobering when Ponyo encounters a drudging vessel which is scraping the ocean's floor uncovering mountains of garbage and debris. One can understand the anger and frustration of the character of Fujimoto who has spent his lifetime trying to repair the damage civilization is doing to its oceans yet finding it an daunting and almost fruitless endeavor.Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film. It is at times bizarre and outrageous but at the same time charming and curious. Clearly Miyazaki wanted to capture the sense and style of a child's imagination. The art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful. It is almost like a child's color book come to life.Child actors Nara Yuria and Doi Hiroki do great work as Ponyo and Sosuke. They bring adorable charm to their roles. Nara Yuria in particular sounds so darn cute as Ponyo that it is little wonder that Doi's Sosuke falls for the magical girl. Former campaign girlmodel and actress Yamaguchi Tomoko Shichinin No Otaku Swallowtail is also very good in her role as Sosuke's modern mom Lisa. I was a bit confused at first by her character as I initially thought she was Sosuke's older sister. It also didn't help that Sosuke kept referring to her as Lisa rather than Mom but I guess it is perhaps a sign of the times and an indicator of the modern Japanese family in the anime series Crayon Shinchan Shinnosuke also refers to his mom by first name as well.80s comedian Tokoro Joji sounds totally different as the serious Fujimoto but wisely doesn't make his character sound cartoony villainous or goofy menacing. While we don't get to know his character more former probaseball player and actor Nagashima Kazushige  who portrays Sosuke's father Koichi also delivers some nice voice work. The opening theme Umi No Okasan by Japanese soprano Masako Hayashi is simply beautiful and stirring. In contrast the Fujimaki Fujioka and Nozomi Ohashi Geke No Ue No Ponyo theme is light and amusing and evokes images of a traditional Japanese nursery rhyme. During one brilliant sequence the soundtrack takes on an almost Wagnerian operatic sound with music that sounds like Die Walkre.The film is not perfect however and does suffer from moments where the central story of Ponyo and Sosuke takes a back seat to some of Miyazaki's overwhelming fantastical visuals. I also had wished we had more time to explore Fujimoto's backstory as well as the relationship between Sosuke and his father.Like Kiki's Delivery ServiceMajo No Takkyubin Howl's Moving Castle Princess MomonokeMomonoke Hime and My Neighbor TotoroTonari No Totoro Gake No Ue No Ponyo is another Miyazaki classic that is a marvelous feast for the eyes. Like a modern day fairytale the film tells a timeless story of friendship and love that will surely be cherished in years to come.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a longtime fan of Studio Ghibli and especially Hayao Miyazaki films I went to the film right on the opening day. When I went out of the theater I had this strange feeling that something was missing this magical feeling I was experiencing in all Miyazaki films before but I couldn't say why it failed this time. After I thought about the other Ghibli movies I may know the reason this film had most of the elements of a great Miyazaki anime cute characters wonderful key animation a great soundtrack composed by Joe Hisaishi and the warm story telling giving you the feeling of watching a high quality Japanese animation film. However two elements were lacking a deep story and dramaturgy. The purpose of this film was obviously to entertain small children with a simple story line as in case of Totoro so a complicated story as been told in Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke is not really necessary but on the other hand this story was simply too superficial. I could not connect to the main characters because there was no character development dramatic scenes were only limited and did not last very long. I really hate to give only 7 stars for a Miyazaki film because I would give 10 stars to all previous movies right away but this time it was simply not this wonderful ghibli experience.".

	schema:headline " A Totoro for the Noughties";
	schema:reviewBody "After the epic fairytale worlds of Howl's Moving Castle and the underwhelming Tales from Earthsea Studio Ghibli's latest is a return to good old 80s Ghibli.The brainchild of Master Miyazaki himself it lacks the elaborate plot of the likes of Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away and makes do with far less characters. Instead we finally go back to seeing the world through the curious wideopen eyes of a child.The story is based on Andersen's The Little Mermaid but as the film progresses it becomes its own dreamlike vision. Ponyo is a 5year old fish princess living in her family's underwater kingdom and when she meets Sousuke a boy of the same age decides she wants to become human herself much to her father's dismay.The underwater scenes are spectacular as one would expect in a Miyazaki picture they are full of strange wonderful creatures that resemble something we may have seen in reality and yet are completely unique in their own right. During the initial sequence that's set in this colourful mysteriously illuminated realm the first point of comparison that came to my mind was the impressive ocean setting in Finding Nemo. However where the Pixar film uses 3D graphics of all sorts to create stunningly realistic and impressive images Ponyo uses a wide range of colours and shapes to create an equally if not more stunning fantasy kingdom. There is not a single CGI pixel anywhere in this film yet the textures are lavishly rich and the movements of light the sea and its inhabitants incredibly fluent. The underwater scenes alone are a stunning artistic achievement.The rest of the film's visuals however impress just as much with their lovely but never kitschy pastel palette and the everloving detail that can be found in every single frame. The casual drawing style of Sousuke's house against the lavish green field in the background the gorgeously peaceful town or a glowing golden moon are only a few examples of the many memorable images.Like in the now20 year old classic My Neighbour Totoro the protagonists are young children and a large part of the film's charm lies in their portrayal. Ever since I was a child and watched Heidi or Anne of Green Gables though I've only realised now what's fascinated me about Miyazaki's animation is the accuracy in which it replicates children's movements mimicry and mannerisms. Ponyo is a stubborn girl who like any little princess can get quite angry if not given what she wants  though with more serious consequences than with most other children. And when she does she behaves and moves in the exact same way that you see little kids do it every day in real life. 8year old voice actress Nara Yuria also does a fantastic job in bringing Ponyo to life and making her the unbelievably lovable cheeky little sh!t that she is. While she is delightfully hilarious in her halffish halfchild shape that defies classification Ponyo never becomes boring once she assumes her human shape. One of the most literally heartwarming moments of the film is when as a human child Ponyo tastes milk with honey for the first time truly savouring the experience. The delighted expression on her little face reminded me of my own childhood firsts and gave me that warm fuzzy feeling in my chest. In many ways Ponyo is very reminiscent of Mei in Totoro.Like Totoro Ponyo also has a good oldfashioned opening sequence and a title song you won't forget too soon after hearing it. Performed by little Ohashi Nozomi the terribly catchy tune is a perfect singalong for any child young or old.And again like its famous predecessor some reviewers have noted somewhat critically at times that Ponyo is aimed at a much younger audience than the more recent Ghibli films. I'd like to phrase it differently and say that this is the first Ghibli in a while that doesn't exclude this target group completely. This film is of course for children but yes as with Totoro its merit lies in its many delights  the lovingly precise portrayal of children's behaviour the many moments of wonder and the sheer artistic vision.By the end of the fastest onehundred minutes ever I had that silly smile on my face and I knew I'd once again witnessed true Miyazaki magic.Of course we'll have to see how well this one will hold up over repeated viewings and how it will be regarded in a decades time but for now I'll say Move over Totoro.1010. Now go see it!".

It was just a tad too juvenile coming across as more for kids and leaving adults to just enjoy the animation.I was also disappointed that the score done by Joe Hisaishi who also the scores for the abovementioned two movies wasn't nearly as memorable this time around. While I can't quite recall Howl's score now I still remember it being one of the most beautiful I had ever heard. Ditto Spirited's  though I only remember it being very complementary to the movie.

The story and the characters are very upfront with their feelingsintentions etc. but that makes them all the more endearing.

It's all handdrawn in the original 2D celanimation style that was state of the art for 7 decades. It's Miyazaki's trademark and it doesn't disappoint.Unfortunately this time around it's in service of a wandering inchoate ultimately pointless plot loosely drawn from Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid which is why I somewhat hesitantly label it a remake.You would not recognize the mermaid however and certainly shouldn't be expecting Disney's Ariel. Ponyo Noah Lindsey Cyrus starts out we are told as a goldfish but the strangest little goldfish you ever saw with a human face bright orange hair no fins and a lower trunk that looks like that of a Hummel figurine except wiggly. Oh and she's about the size of your fist. At that she's 34 times bigger than the hundreds of other goldfish  a giggling gaggle of miniature Ponyettes her sisters?  who inhabit the same hole in the seabed and continue to put in guest appearances thruout the movie.Ponyo is carried to the surface atop a jellyfish following in the wake of her father Fujimoto. He apparently qualifies for the title not because he's the King Goldfish he looks like an overdressed David Bowie but because he's the father of everything in the sea as well as their selfappointed protector. He purports to loathe human beings and in one of several incongruously technical geological references says he wants to bring about a new Cambrian Explosion. I'm usually happy to encounter mention of Darwinian processes but what the heck this is doing in a kids' fairy tale is beyond me.Once near the surface Ponyo gets her head trapped in a jelly jar but she's freed by 5year old Sosuke Frankie Jonas an unfailingly kind and polite little boy whose mom Risa or Lisa Tina Fey works in a retirement home and whose dad Koichi Matt Damon is a frequently absent ship's captain. The family lives in a big rambling house on a cliff overlooking the sea and it is here they repair after Ponyo sprouts legs arms and a hankering for ham sandwiches. Oh and balloons up to the same size as Sosuke.There's a Greek chorus of old ladies at Lisa's workplace the Moon comes to visit for an extended stay a typhoon covers everything in 20 metres of standing water but causes no damage ocean waves turn into fish with eyes a toy boat gets magically enlarged to become a seaworthy craft and Guran Mamere Cate Blanchett the spirit of the sea arrives in time to help rebalance the karmic equilibrium of the planet.Wonders to behold to be sure but bearing no obvious connection to each other just a bunch of novel ideas thrown together at random. It's clearly silly to expect causeeffect relationships let alone explanations but a certain minimal amount of coherence is necessary. In a world where anything can happen who cares what does?".

The family lives in a big rambling house on a cliff overlooking the sea and it is here they repair after Ponyo sprouts legs arms and a hankering for ham sandwiches. Oh and balloons up to the same size as Sosuke.There's a Greek chorus of old ladies at Lisa's workplace the Moon comes to visit for an extended stay a typhoon covers everything in 20 metres of standing water but causes no damage ocean waves turn into fish with eyes a toy boat gets magically enlarged to become a seaworthy craft and Guran Mamere Cate Blanchett the spirit of the sea arrives in time to help rebalance the karmic equilibrium of the planet.Wonders to behold to be sure but bearing no obvious connection to each other just a bunch of novel ideas thrown together at random. It's clearly silly to expect causeeffect relationships let alone explanations but a certain minimal amount of coherence is necessary. In a world where anything can happen who cares what does?";

Miyazaki is well known for his work on on Spirited away and Howl's moving castle. well for western viewers anyway. both of them films were kind of similar to each other but at the same time completely different. However Ponyo is a whole different type of story and animation all together. The story follows Ponyo a fish that has the face a girl. After Ponyo runs away from her home at the bottom of the sea she find a whole new world she never knew was out there and new trouble as well when she almost caught by a fishing boat she was rescued by a five year old boy known as Sousuke. the story then follows the two of them and the pure friendship between a boy and a fish. can Ponyo really stay with Sousuke forever ? I feel the movie was inspired by The little mermaid and at the same time similar to Tonari no Totoro the movie is very short and you have very little time to learn about the characters in this movie. But the Characters a fish and a little boy so how much are you expecting to learn about them? the film is set over about what seems to be 3 days I think this is why the movie is so short. I really enjoyed watching this movie and I hope you all enjoy this movie as well".

	schema:headline " Unsatisfying";
	schema:reviewBody "I thought long and hard before giving the film this score but there are simply too many things that make Ponyo not work for me. This latest animated movie from Miyazaki who needs no introductions had the intriguing premise of the sea. He spoke of the sea being a character in itself. I was intrigued to see the movie. I knew it had two children as the frontline but being a fan of My Neighbour Totoro I knew that Miyazaki has an unreal insight into the mindset of children.The very first scene of Ponyo is breathtaking. Hundreds of fishes and jellyfish accompanied by breathtaking oceanic music finally zooming in on a man in a pinstriped suit creating a bubble around his ship. We later find out that he is the father of one of the main characters the fish girl Ponyo who wants to become human after befriending Sotsuke a 5year old boy living in a house by the sea. She is able to do this with a mixture of her father's magic which she's inherited and Sotsuke's blood a drop of which she licked when he cut himself.The problem with Ponyo is the vagueness of the story. There is practically no sense of conflict to the story at all. There is no substantial threat to the characters and they have very little development. That the characters are so young shouldn't justify this if we remember Mei in My Neighbour Totoro. Also Ponyo's father is so at odds with practically everything in the movie's universe it's hilarious and offputting at the same time. Ponyo herself is personally creepy rather than cute and her numerous little siblings are no different. I don't understand how nobody finds it peculiar that Ponyo supposedly a goldfish has a humanoid face and Sotsuke shows her to quite a few people. It's even weirder when Lisa Sotsuke's mother whom he oddly always refers to by name an intelligent woman sees Ponyo eat a slice of ham in whole as a goldfish and isn't at all surprised about it. The only really developed character and the warmest is the loudest of the old women at the retirement home where Lisa works.What Ponyo lacks in substance it makes up for in visuals. The movie's highlight in my opinion is where Lisa and Sotsuke are driving down a road continually drenched in waves on top of which Ponyo is running. These waves take on the form of giant fish. A wonderful piece of animation. The many underwater scenes are beautiful with underwater creatures big and small swimming. Something about the overall production values of the visuals feel a bit unfocused though. The morse code scene is then hilarious.On the whole however Ponyo feels like a lot of elements that just don't work together. Sotsuke faces no real trials like other young Miyazaki protagonists have faced. None of the characters feel like they serve any real purpose other than to bring Sotsuke and Ponyo together. The film's subplot of Ponyo's magic causing a rift in the natural order and causing the moon to come closer which explains the flood is never sufficiently delivered to the audience.I was simply expecting a better delivery from a master storyteller like Miyazaki. Ponyo may only really work for the smallest children but that's excluding a large part of Miyazaki's fanbase. He's one of those filmmakers whom I respect for continually showing people that animated movies can be for people of all ages. Ponyo obviously aims at a lower age group but I just hope that the children will be more drawn into Sotsuke and Ponyo's story than I was there is so much courteous andor cute dialogue that I felt downright embarrassed at points.Decent but definitely not the brightest spot in Miyazaki's repertoire.".

In a way his 2D CGIfree screens are even more aesthetically absorbing than 3D Pixar. The Japanese language version while more authentic has the drawback of subtitles vying with the beautiful detailrich screen for you attention. But then Tomoko Yamaguchi's voice is so wonderful as the absolutely adorable mother Lisa.To say that Miyazaki excels in creative imagination is like saying the sun rises in the east. What is so exceptional about this man is that he also gives you the audience room for your own imagination. Even a kids' movie like Ponyo is no exception.In addition to imagination there is also thought association. While the obvious declared association is with Anderson's Little Mermaid there are other associations abound. The menacing ocean echoes Frank Schatzing's Scifi thriller The swarm. The rejuvenation process easily brings to mind the wonderful movie Cocoon 1985. And then the background music when Ponyo is running on top of towering waves resembles Ride of the Valkries. From a quick glimpse of the subtitle Ponyo's original name seems to be Brunnhilde or very close to it in The Ring Cycle and she only has sisters. Maybe it's just me but could there be an Wagnerian subconscious in the moviemaking?".

	schema:headline " Return to Innocence  A Review of Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea";
	schema:reviewBody "Said to be inspired from Disney's The Little Mermaid Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is Japanese animation master Hayao Miyazaki's next big work after the wellreceived Spirited Away in 2001 and Howl's Moving Castle in 2004. In Ponyo his signature style of animating fantasy realms and children characters are on display once again.Sosuke Hiroki Doi the boy lead in the film discovers a 'goldfish' trapped in a glass jar while playing by the seaside below the cliff. He stays with his mum Lisa Tomoko Yamaguchi above and atop it. Sosuke shakes the jar forcefully to try and get the 'goldfish' out but the little 'goldfish' is stuck. He then tries to pull it out but it just cannot come loose. Sosuke then place the jar on the ground before smashing a small rock onto it breaking it into pieces instantly while suffering a small cut on the finger. He then checks inquisitively to see if the 'goldfish' is still alive. As he observes it the 'goldfish' reacts by licking the blood off his finger suddenly. Excited Sosuke quickly rushes back to the house and put the 'goldfish' in a small bucket of water in hope that it will survive. It did and he named it 'Ponyo'Yuria Nara.The above scene would signify what is to come for the remainder of the film. It is of the interactions between Sosuke and Ponyo. And it is one that Hayao Miyazaki did meticulously well in portraying. He must have a keen sense of observation and understanding of how children behave before he depicts this chemistry of communication between the two main characters. The behavior of the children would also extend into the rest of the film in their further encounters.The affection between Sosuke and Ponyo grew as the film progresses from the moment Sosuke brought Ponyo to school in Lisa's car. The best moment came when the two were reunited after a brief separation when Ponyo's father Fujimoto George Tokoro a magical sea dweller recaptures the errant Ponyo before encapsulating her in a magic bubble with kind intention.Fujimoto who was once human has grown to refer humans with disgust for polluting the sea and stealing its life. But all Ponyo wants is to be human and be with Sosuke so for a second time she escapes accidentally emptying his father's precious store of magical elixir into the sea creating a storm of tidal waves and engulfing the small town in the process.What follows are the adventures of Sosuke and Ponyo in the flooded town.Is there a happily ever after in this one? Would true love prevail? You find out.Looking at the art in Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea there appears to be a deviation from Miyazaki's past works in terms of rendering. It looks unfamiliar because the environment apart from the characters at play in every scene is not colored in the usual fashion as in Spirited Away 2001 and Howl's Moving Castle 2004. The aesthetical appeal is discounted from what appears to be color penciled drawings. The objects and characters are also not as detailed as before.This is peculiar if taken on face value but from the way the story is written and told the possible explanation is that Miyazaki is allowing the audience to view the film with a child's tint yet allowing the adults to reminisce on a Japan when they were younger. This move could have prevented prospective moviegoers new to Miyazaki's work to see it. The trailer did nothing to promote Ponyo as well. Taking the case to Japan however would be a different story as Miyazaki's credential far than exceed any marketing technique.In summary though the whole did not equal to its parts. Aside from Miyazaki's ability to cast vivacious and animated characters the film lacks elements of thrill and wonder when measured against previous works resulting in a deficit of big screen presence.The sparks of Ponyo and Sosuke failed to light up the film in a big way but moments of warmth kindness and love can still be found in recognizing the film as one that is not made for the kids but of the kids who everyone is or once was.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd like to preface my review by mentioning that I've grown up with Miyazaki films they have colored my childhood and given me the myths and stories that I cherish. That being said Miyazaki is to me what most Disney films are to most Americans. We have fond memories attached to artifacts from our childhood and as a result they command our attention and respect even as we grow into adults.Despite the warm place that Miyazaki's works have in my heart I was deeply disappointed in PONYO. The art direction and animation was subpar lazy and ultimately rushed. The story had an overly sentimental aspect to it that I feel like earlier Miyazaki films were able to avoid without sacrificing a heartwarmingtouching feeling to it. In addition to the sappy story was there a story? The narrative was all over the place lacked focus and I was so sad and surprised to find myself bored and checking my watch 20minutes into the film! As an example of the simplicity and not in a good way of the story what was with the test that Ponyo's mother conducts? It's a question of whether Sousuke loves Ponyo? What? He's 5 years old! There are some positive elements of the film although I was hardpressed to identify them. First the opening sequence was absolutely beautiful in its multilayered presentation. The colors were popping with a balanced approach to detail and simple shapes that it gave the entire sea world life. Other parts of the animation that were great were Ponyo's Mother's hair the fish waves and...that's it. In closing I'm having a hard time wondering why there are so many glowing reviews. I understand everyone is entitled to their opinion. It seems like many people are so starved for Miyazaki films in the U.S. that they're willing to give glowing reviews to make the film successful in order to keep his films distributed on a wide scale. While I can understand this argument and position I feel that we should voice our opinions when a work of art is not up to par and when we know that the artist has it in him to do so much better.".

	schema:headline " Less memorable and magical than Miyazaki's other films but still cute and charming.";
	schema:reviewBody "It has been widely agreed that Hayao Miyazaki is a master at his craft when it comes to combining rich animation with thoughtful story lines and similarly imaginative characters. His movies from NAUSICAA TOTORO KIKI LAPUTA and MONONOKE to the recent HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE are all not only gorgeously rendered in terms of art but in terms of moviemaking as well. Can this man do no wrong? Not really but it is impossible to expect everyone of his movies to always be five star marvels. His newest film PONYO an unashamedly familyfriendly tale of a goldfish out of water is as lushly animated and alive with interesting characters as you would expect... and yet this is the first film of his which treads into lesser territory. Don't get me wrong PONYO is not a bad movie by any means. As mentioned it is a sight for the eyes and is as charming and adorable as TOTORO and KIKI. The problem is that the story doesn't stay afloat to satisfy anyone eager for another engrossing indepth plot.For its opening hour PONYO is Miyazaki storytelling at its finest in which a rowdy and overeager young goldfish who later becomes named Ponyo makes a forbidden trip to the human world where she is subsequently adopted by a boy her own age named Sosuke modeled interestingly after the director's own son. This does not please Ponyo's father a mysterious wizard named Fujimoto who is very angry at the humans for their destruction of the sea this environmentalist theme is not much different from Miyazaki's other films... a problem he very much intends to rectify by creating jellyfish from the prow of his submarine. He separates the pair and tries to talk Ponyo into staying underwater with him. The goldfish however has already tasted both Sosuke's blood healing a cut on his finger AND some of the human food ham which she becomes inexplicably addicted to and of course steals into her father's forbidden potions transforming into a hyperactive young girl who is the spitting image of Mei from MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO. This triggers a dangerous tsunami which threatens to engulf the entire world with water. Conspiring with his wife Gran Mamare a diaphanous sea goddess who alternatingly shifts from supersized titan to humansize form Fujimoto decides to test the two youngsters' love for each other. They do this by elevating the sea to the level of Sosuke's house prompting the youngsters to set out across their now oceaninfested world in an oversized toyboat made possible by Ponyo's own magical powers.It is at this point where PONYO begins to run out of steam. Although Ponyo and Sosuke are adorable and the scenes involving them are funny and cute they slow down the film. Where the film really takes on water unfortunately is at the climax in which Sosuke must prove his love to Ponyo presented in a way which is strangely anticlimactic and rushed bringing an otherwise charming tale to an abrupt halt. This will likely underwhelm viewers expecting another instant masterpiece from the man who has delivered far more interesting finales for many of his other movies. Remember the destruction of Laputa? Satsuki's search for little Mei? Kiki's rescue of Tombo? Porco Rosso's fight with Curtis? The rescue of the Forest Spirit's head? Or even the test between Chihiro and Yubaba? All those resolutions were far more satisfying and felt more complete than this one.On a technical level PONYO cannot be faulted. The animation is absolutely gorgeous to look at produced entirely without a single shot of computergeneratedimagery and naturally Joe Hisaishi provides us with yet another breathtaking musical score the best moments being the rousing sequences underwater accompanied by a chorus and a soprano voice. And the backgrounds are lovingly painted and detailed as any other Ghibli movies.Having proved themselves worthy on translating and dubbing Ghibli's previous movies into English with topquality results Disney Studios and Pixar once again provide an English dub complete with a mostly capable cast of actors. Frankie Jonas is surprisingly good as Sosuke sounding very natural and believable throughout. Noah Cyrus as Ponyo on the other hand sometimes goes overboard in shouting her lines before eventually settling down toward the end. Leads aside the rest of the cast includes Liam Neeson as the overprotective Fujimoto who manages himself unsurprisingly well in the character Cate Blanchett as Gran Mamare in an omnipresent tone which is not much different from her Galadriel in LORD OF THE RINGS Matt Damon as Sosuke's constantly seafaring father Koichi who is good but nothing to write home about and Tina Fey as Lisa. Of them Fey is the best voice in the entire cast imbuing the character with just the right amount of spirit and personality. Her scenes with Sosuke show real chemistry. On the other hand Cloris Leachman who was spectacular as Dola in CASTLE IN THE SKY is disappointingly wasted as one of three handicapped elderly women she barely has ANY lines! who are also voiced by Betty White and Lily Tomlin. Of them only Tomlin's character a cantankerous woman named Toki shows any real personality but if I were casting the movie I'd switch Tomlin with Leachman. Probably the only really jarring drawback of the dub is a blasty technoremix of the film's catchy but ridiculously repetitive title song which thankfully doesn't occur until midway through the closing credits.On the whole PONYO is a good film a fine piece of animated work which is perfect for youngsters and family audiences. Due to the loss of momentum toward the end though it falls far short of classic status. Since Miyazaki at his least is still better than a majority of other animated films though I'll be generous and give PONYO a full star recommendation because any feature of his is still very much worth watching particularly on the big screen. Be sure to catch it in the theaters while you can.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ponyo is without a doubt one of the loveliest films I've seen. I don't think anyone with a soul can be without smiling at least once during this wonderful piece of work from the hands of animation legend Hayao Miyazaki. There is so much to love about Ponyo.The story bears a vague resemblance to Little Mermaid. The main character a 5year old boy named Sosuke finds a goldfish in a bottle on the beach and decides to name it Ponyo. Through a series of events Ponyo ends up wanting to become human and then they have a little adventure together. In traditional terms there hardly is a story there's no conflict no main villain no overall goal to achieve and very little character development. Yet none of this will ever bother because the visuals the animation and the pure joy the film absolutely oozes of are so overwhelming they drown out any complaints I might have about the film.That said the movie really has to have a visual edge if it is to drown out everything else. In that regard Ponyo truly delivers. Everything looks eyepoppingly gorgeous from the water effects to the expressive and instantly distinguishable characters. Most have praised the water effects as the show stealer but for me it is the animation of the children. Just watching Ponyo run jump and bounce around with the sheer unbridled joy of a child is a wonder to watch. Look at Sosuke's expressions the first time he hears Ponyo talk I bet that's exactly how you would have looked like if you'd found as a child that your pet could talk. The audio is also excellent with thudding sound effects and a riveting musical score that makes even the smallest moments feel meaningful. Ponyo's voice actor is the icing on the cake giving a performance so adorable it's almost unbearable.But the most effective part of Ponyo is its atmosphere which is quite hard to describe. In short Ponyo makes you feel like a child adventuring in the woods again. The seemingly limitless positive energy the film has reminds us of the innocence of childhood when nothing bad could really happen because there always was someone looking after you. It's also in the little details for example we hardly ever see Sosuke's mother unless he himself is in the same scene. The main conflict is only slightly hinted at resembling the kind of things only grownups talked about and understood when we were kids.In summation Ponyo is a fantastic beautiful work of pure joy that can be enjoyed by any ages. You need to see this film last week.".

I watched the entire movie with a big silly grin on my face.I needed a good animated experience to remove the mediocrity of Howl's Moving Castle from my brain and Ponyo more than delivered. It's a simply beautiful movie which is to be expected but so was Howl. What makes Ponyo so much better is that it sticks to a simple story and tells it very well. This was obviously made so a younger child could easily follow it but it's equally as captivating for adult viewers.There's no big worldending disaster to prevent no dastardly villain to escape and no heavyhanded moral. There is a very slight message about taking care of the oceans but that never interferes with the charming little story that's being told. Things never become bigger than the relationship between a 5 yearold boy and his unusual new friend. And the plot greatly benefits from that narrow focus. If I absolutely must nitpick the middle of the movie wasn't quiet as marvelous as the excellent beginning and strong ending. Still I'd recommend this movie to absolutely anyone. If you don't like it you just don't have a heart. ".

	schema:reviewBody "For a select few the arrival of a new Hayao Miyazaki film is more celebrated than any of Pixar's blockbusters and with good reason as each of the renowned Japanese director's traditionally animated features takes upwards of three years to produce. The worlds he depicts are beautiful teeming with life color and spirit and Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea his latest is no exception.Allegedly Miyazaki's final film he abandoned even the aid of computers in crafting Ponyo each frame being hand drawn and colored by his Studio Ghibli artists and with stunning results. From its lush island vistas to busy underwater seascapes the film offers definitive proof to the superiority or if nothing else credence for the continuation of traditional animation.The sweeping elegance of the art renders Miyazaki's films generally unhatable but the emotional honesty of his characters is what makes them timeless. As a father of two his knack for exploring the family dynamic from a child's perspective is revelatory. The children lucky enough to live in Miyazaki's imagination exemplify not only what makes real children cute or endearing but also what makes them stubborn and vulnerable.Enter Sosuke voiced in the English dub by baby Jonas brother Frankie who transcends his gimmicky casting and delivers a warm and compelling performance as Ponyo's protagonist. Opposite him fittingly enough is teenybopper Miley Cyrus' little sister Noah who does a fine job as well though is limited mostly to highpitched sentence fragments like Ponyo loves Sosuke!The two meet on the shore below Sosuke's cliffside home after Ponyo a princess of the sea has eluded her father and unwittingly caught herself in a tiny glass jar from which Sosuke frees her. The plot is more freeform than some of Miyazaki's previous works but perhaps all the more magic for it. The universe of Ponyo isn't painstakingly established and the supernatural and the incredible routinely go unquestioned existing in an alternate plane of reality which keeps the film feeling spontaneous and often wonderful.If Ponyo does prove to be Miyazaki's last film it could potentially suffer from Eyes Wide Shut syndrome symptoms of which include unfair comparisons to its director's previous work and microscopelevel nitpicking which is entirely undeserved. The film is not his careerredefining masterwork nor is it in any way unworthy of the legacy that preceded it. It's objectively independently great. Ponyo has a simple beauty to it that rivals that of My Neighbor Totoro and fantasy sequences that recall the best of Spirited Away.For its great cast Tina Fey Matt Damon Cate Blanchett and Liam Neeson comprise a great dub however blasphemous that may sound to Miyazaki purists easygoing earnestness and beautifully inventive visuals Ponyo is my pick for animated film of the year 'up setting' Pixar's 2009 heavyweight which had emotion to spare but came up short in adventure.But those select few will share my disappointment when the envelope is opened and the monosyllabic winner is read on Oscar night. Miyazaki's latest is worthwhile even for those who associate Japanese animated films with stuffy conventions and overweight teens in costumes. Ponyo is a modern family classic on par with The Little Mermaid and the rest of the Disney goldenera library.Miyazaki is a magician and like a magician everything he shows you isn't essential to your comprehension of the trick but the end result is so beautiful that there's no sense in questioning it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been reading a lot of different opinions and reviews of this movie and I understand why a lot of people get mixed feelings about Ponyo whether it be the story line animation dialogue and so forth. And I believe the most simple way I can answer to this is that it's a movie for a much much younger age bracket. An age bracket much younger than that of Tonarino Totoro My Neighbor Totoro.Being a Miyazaki fan like the majority of the surfers on this site I expected the wonderful animation music composition complex story telling the great steady development of characters how the story intertwines with today's society etc etc etc of a typical Miyazaki film that we grew up with. And to tell you the truth I didn't quite understand what the hell this story was supposed to be about or what the hell was going on until an hour and twenty minutes with twenty minutes left in the movie that this movie is NOT for the deep thinkers and hard core Ghibliists but for the toddlers and youngins' and happy go lucky Japanese people. Also I believe this movie is based on simplicity and creative animation straightup grass roots Ghibli Studios style. The fact that a villain is not present really surprised me other than the father and maybe that crazyass typhoon. But other than that this movie is just plain fun to stimulate a young one's mind and to make happy good time feeling. That's all. The animation goes back to the oldschool mid80s early90s era of Miyazaki's films where very specific detail wasn't a big focus unlike Mononoke Hime Princess Mononoke and the latter. I admire the simplicity which kind of created some small nostalgia when I first watched Ghibli movies like Tonarino Totoro when I was a child. The reaction and movement of the children are all very similar to that of kids and a lot of Studio Ghibli's body language is very noticeable. Studio Ghibli added some creative moments and sceneries that they can only do with it's wonderful animators but it probably won't take the ritual Ghibliist in awe.The Japanese dialogue also sounded very child friendly and a lot of scenes and dialogues are very very relative from what Japanese kids and mothers would say and act. The music if very hoppy and fluffy I guess you could say similar to Totoro from beginning to end. Even the darker scenes didn't seem assertive.In the end this movie is one of a kind. Just about every aspect of this movie is for children. And I waited a whole 80 mins to realize that. Quite frankly I have never seen a movie told or shown it the way Miyazaki did. It's refreshing to see that Studio Ghibli can still tell a story for a wider and much different scale of audience and still keep that trademark Ghibli impression.".

It's about three siblings left to fend for themselves after one of their gaurdians dies and their mother appears to drink herself to death out of sight for much of the film. The two sisters and brother have only each other to rely on the brother starting to work in what appear to be illegal mines in Ukraine and this is a recent documentary! at the age of 13 to support his two sisters no masks on in this mine or anything I dread to think of the damage done to his young lungs.It's difficult not to care about the fates of these three. The older sister often seems to crack under the stress wanting to help a self destructive mother while overwhelmed with guilt and selfpity. The youngest sister has character and her interactions with her brother are warm and amusing while her brother has something very endearing about him and seems to always try his best to remain positive. Odd as it may sound he at points reminds me of Michael Cera.Spoilers comingWhat's most heartbreaking to me is when the oldest sister seems to give up on their life and rejects the idea of supporting her two siblings thereby escaping their poverty. She leaves them...And so the boy who's always dreamt of getting out of this small town now finds himself stuck there albeit with one less person to look after Huge spoiler coming until his last bit of nearby familyhis younger sisteris taken away.Spoilers overThese children are older now and I'm not entirely sure that they're alive and well given the current situation in Ukraine though they've had their hardships since the documentary's end. I don't think I'll ever be able to forget their faces and their story. It is one that sticks with those of us who've never had it so difficult...And it is one that opens one's eyes to what's going on. Sometimes in our modern age it's easy to forget or be ignorant of some of the hardship and strife people in other countries sometimes even in one's own have to endure. A documentary like this puts it out into the open. I hope more people see this and I hope these three are well out of the bloody valley of death that Ukraine has become in the past few months and that they may one day find each other again and possibly forgive one another. I hope that they live on to find something better than what they've known.This isn't like many documentaries I've seen and I wholeheartedly recommend it. For those that don't speak in Russian I haven't seen the dubbedsubbed ? versions but based on the reactions I've seen from nonRussian speakers it has just as strong an impact.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think of this is a great rainy afternoon movie. You're flipping through the channels on one of those great lazy Saturdays...it's summer but it's raining outdoors and you're stuck inside. You come across a classic movie channel AMC TCMtake your pick and pause. What's this? Ernest Borgnine? You always like him why not stop for a moment and watch. It looks like it's just beginning. Marty? Yeah you've heard of it vaguely. Won the Oscar or something but it's been kind of forgotten. So you start watching and before long you're totally enchanted completely charmed by the simple story and realistic characters. Who can't sympathize with Borgnine's sensitive butcher hanging out with his Italian friends and their goofy conversations about Mickey Spillane all the while pining away with his heart of gold for a girl that his buddies call a dog? The conversations have the kind of natural humor and warmth that remind you of the old days hanging out with your pals. As you watch the movie you find yourself enthralled and you never change the channel watching it till the end realizing that you've seen this plot riffed on and spoofed on various TV shows films and cartoons over the years. When the movie's done you're really excitedthis is one of those films you discovered on your own and nothing can beat that thrill. Now this isn't the way I saw MartyI rented it and now own it on DVDbut it's the spirit I get from it. I love the conversation between Marty and his best friend its street poetry that's entertaining without being false in the diner as their Friday night lays out ahead of them. I love Marty and Clara's walk their honesty and his enthusiasm you worry is he going to far being too gregarious for the shy Clara? Will it work? I love the preparations for Sunday Mass the fight between the married couple and Marty agonizing over standing up his girl while his friends have an amusingly banal and silly conversation in which they keep repeating themselves. It's really just a charming and wonderful film joyful even in its sad moments. If you don't enjoy it what can I say but my recommendation comes completely honest and from the heart. This is one of those personal favorites that also happens to be an underrated classicbut just underrated enough so that the joy of discovering it on a rainy Saturday afternoon remains undiluted.".

So you start watching and before long you're totally enchanted completely charmed by the simple story and realistic characters. Who can't sympathize with Borgnine's sensitive butcher hanging out with his Italian friends and their goofy conversations about Mickey Spillane all the while pining away with his heart of gold for a girl that his buddies call a dog? The conversations have the kind of natural humor and warmth that remind you of the old days hanging out with your pals. As you watch the movie you find yourself enthralled and you never change the channel watching it till the end realizing that you've seen this plot riffed on and spoofed on various TV shows films and cartoons over the years. When the movie's done you're really excitedthis is one of those films you discovered on your own and nothing can beat that thrill. Now this isn't the way I saw MartyI rented it and now own it on DVDbut it's the spirit I get from it. I love the conversation between Marty and his best friend its street poetry that's entertaining without being false in the diner as their Friday night lays out ahead of them. I love Marty and Clara's walk their honesty and his enthusiasm you worry is he going to far being too gregarious for the shy Clara? Will it work? I love the preparations for Sunday Mass the fight between the married couple and Marty agonizing over standing up his girl while his friends have an amusingly banal and silly conversation in which they keep repeating themselves. It's really just a charming and wonderful film joyful even in its sad moments. If you don't enjoy it what can I say but my recommendation comes completely honest and from the heart. This is one of those personal favorites that also happens to be an underrated classicbut just underrated enough so that the joy of discovering it on a rainy Saturday afternoon remains undiluted.";

Betsy is a teacher in Brooklyn with college degree and like Marty is very insecure and has the feeling of rejection by men. They feel attracted by each other and spend a wonderful night together. On the next day before and after the Sunday Mass Marty's relatives and friends make jokes with the lack of beauty in Clara. The marvelous open end of the story uncommon in American movies is one of the best I have ever seen. This movie is a simple beautiful and touching love story with magnificent performances of the cast and a sensitive direction. The story and slangs dog tomatoes etc. are dated in 2004 but does not jeopardize the beauty of this delightful romance.

	schema:reviewBody "Rarely does a scene come along in a movie that's so powerful affective and ultimately satisfying as the scene at the end of Marty' when the title character stands up to his shallow friends.  Ernest Borgnine plays Marty in a performance that's so heartwarming kind and earnest it would take a very cold man not to love him.  Marty is an honest butcher who at thirtyfour years old has been turned very insecure by the years of being turned away by women because of his looks and nervous manner.The film spans over two days in Marty's life starting in the morning of the first day and ending at night in the second.  Marty lives timidly but happily as a single butcher with shallow sex crazy friends and a mother at home who acts as peacemaker in family battles.  The mother Esther Minciotti also nags Marty to find a gal and get married but Marty argues Whatever it is woman want I don't got.'Eventually she persuades or forces Marty to go to a dance ball and find a woman.  Marty goes with his friend Angie Joe Mantell Angie gets a dance Marty doesn't.  Eventually Marty is confronted with an offer by a slimy man on the dance floor the man will pay Marty five dollars to take home his date Clara Betsy Blair because he wants to dance with a more attractive woman.  Marty refuses but another man accepts and it ends with Clara running off crying.  With both bravery and sympathy Marty walks up to Clara and introduces himself.That starts what's one of the most affective and touching love stories in movie history.  Both are insecure because of their appearances  Marty because of his weight and Clara because of her gawkiness which is admirable any other movie would have Ernest Borgnine romancing someone like Grace Kelly.  They are awkward at first Clara is quiet and Marty rambles but they soon grow comfortable with each other.  They spend a wonderful night together that's fuelled not by lust or sex but by sympathy kindness and a deep understanding of each other.By the end of the night once Marty drops Clara off at home he waltzes happily through the street.  This scene is joyous and wonderful and powerful when he hits a stop sign in delight it's like a ballet.But things aren't so well the next day.  Marty's mother says she doesn't like Clara and is not approving but we know because of a subplot that she is really just afraid of being alone.  Marty's friends are perplexed as to why Marty would want to date a woman so plain and badger him about it. Marty is insecure so he spends the day passively nodding as everyone around him berates his choice for a woman.  We saw their time together so we know what a mistake he can make if he doesn't call her like he promised which makes the ending all the more glorious.This movie is lovable on all accounts writing characters music direction setting and especially the performances.  Borgnine who spent his time before this film playing sadistic killers in B movies is so irresistible in this film it's hard to imagine him as a mean guy which makes him a good actor I guess.  His performance is so realized he's got the character down flat as he effortlessly moves through each scene.  He won the only Oscar of his career for his role here and it was an Oscar well deserved.The supporting cast is small but it rounds out fine with Blair embodying sweetness as Clara and Minciotti perfectly portraying the Italian mother. The others are fine but in small roles I find it most perplexing that Mantell received an Oscar nom for his work in this.  I was surprised that Jack Lemmon won an Oscar that year for Mister Roberts' but I guess if this was his competitionMarty' is a terrific original chick flick that achieves cinematic grandness in a few scenes.  A mustsee for everyone 810.".

Ernest Borgnine deserves the praise he has received for his performance as Marty and he seems very natural in the part for all that it seems so different from most of his other roles.  The other characters are also rendered believably and events develop naturally. While the two main characters may think of themselves as failures viewers can see that they are just ordinary persons trying to be honest and sensitive and this makes it easy to identify with them.The story efficiently introduces Marty and the other characters showing how he interacts with them.  Since the others are all so absorbed in their own concerns they view Marty solely in terms of how he fits in with their own plans and desires again making it easy for the viewer to relate to him. Joe Mantell Esther Minciotti Augusta Ciolli and Jerry Paris make Marty's family and friends thoroughly believable and they work well in their interactions with Borgnine.  By the time that Marty meets Clara Betsy Blair everything is set up so as to get the most out of the possibilities.Praise also goes to Delbert Mann and Paddy Chayefsky for being willing to make a movie out of such lowkey material.  It may not impress those who have become benumbed by the ostentation of presentday filmmakers since its quality is of a subtler more unaffected kind.  But it's a worthwhile achievement in its own right a story about ordinary persons and everyday concerns of the kind that takes skill and understanding to make well.".

I also loved the theme music which is actually sung at the end over the credits where they show the name of the actor plus a view of the actor from the film  this is a technique used all too little nowadays  and this absence is most regrettable as it enabled you to put a face to a name !!

I don't think during any time men would think of her as ugly. Ms. Blair is just not homely and it does detract from an otherwise excellent script.

Great way to see how we have choices whether we realize them or not. We see how we all have our own things going on in our lives our own agendas. We all impact others and are impacted by others.

Running only ninety minutes the 1955 movie holds the distinction of being the shortest film to win the Best Picture Oscar and its scale is indeed very small  it covers a weekend in the life of a lonely overweight Bronx butcher named Marty Piletti. The eldest of six children the youngest of whom just got married Marty lives a routine life living with his widowed mother and hanging out with best pal Angie the source of a classically circular piece of dialogue  What do you feel like doing tonight? I don't know Ange. What do you feel like doing?. Pushed by his mother to go to the Stardust Ballroom where there are a lot of tomatoes he inadvertently meets Clara an equally lonely spinster schoolteacher from Brooklyn. It's intriguing to see how cultural mores have changed since both characters are considered overthehill for marriage even though he is only 34 and she 29. As they grapple toward intimacy they face not only their own doubts but those of the people closest to Marty since they become aware how dependent they are on his constant availability.Directed by Delbert Mann in his first time out at the helm the production seems accurate in capturing the atmosphere of the mid1950's lower middle class and the dramatically effective setting allows Marty's story to take on a wellearned poignancy. This has primarily to do with the honest unsentimental dialogue by Paddy Chavefsky several years before The Hospital and Network. The observant performances complement the treatment with Ernest Borgnine giving his careerbest performance in the title role. Even though he is sometimes too robust to be completely convincing as a socially defeated man he brings surprising force to scenes when his selfawareness no longer can be hide his pain. Looking very much like Julie Harris at the time Betsy Blair has a tougher role as Clara since her character is so withdrawn as to fade when Marty dominates the conversation. Even with her intentionally lank presence Blair is too attractive to be considered mercilessly as a dog. The rest of the cast takes more predictable turns  Esther Minciotti as Marty's clinging Italian mother Joe Mantell as codependent Angie Jerry Paris a few years before his days as neighbor Jerry Helper on The Dick Van Dyke Show and Karen Steele constantly bickering as Marty's cousin and his wife. It's a solidly modest film with no pretensions. Other than the theatrical trailer featuring producer Burt Lancaster's glowing praises the DVD has no significant extras.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a kid I came to know Ernest Borgnine through McHales Navy. Then I grew up and quickly forgot everything I ever knew about him. Then along came a movie called Quiz Show about the game show scandals of the 50's where one of the plot points revolved around a game show question pertaining to this movie winning Best Picture and Ernest Borgnine winning Best Actor. And I thought to myself is this made up? What could the guy from McHales Navy possibly do to win an Oscar for Best Actor? It seemed ridiculous. A fluke. Possibly made up for the movie Quiz Show. After passing up numerous opportunities to see this film over the last 40 plus years I finally saw it on TCM and I am schooled. Everyone in their lives no matter how beautiful they are or think they are has felt like these characters at some point. It is the universal feeling of loneliness and alienation and it is explored thoughtfully and sympathetically here. It also explores the casualties of love. A daughter gets married equals a Mother loses her son. A guy falls in love with a girl equals his best friend loses companionship. Falling in love shifts everything around it and not always gently. Love is messy even at its borders. So here we have Ernest Borgnine and Esther Minciotti son and Mother in the film giving truly once in a lifetime performances in this tiny little movie. Their kindness towards each other far beyond the script they're working from is touching. Jerry Paris pre Dick Van Dyke show is remarkable as another son with his own set of relationship problems. The sarge from Gomer Pyle is in this too. It's a proverbial cavalcade of upcoming '60's television. But at it's heart it is a touching movie that everyone should see. I wish I hadn't waited so long. Ernest Borgnine was given the chance of a lifetime to play Marty. Though terrific in everything he ever did nothing before or after Marty gave him the opportunity to show what a truly gifted actor he is. Thank God someone was smart enough to cast him.".

	schema:reviewBody "Among other things Marty will be known for is being the best film Burt Lancaster ever produced without Burt Lancaster the actor. Hard to disagree with four Academy Awards credited to the film.Originally a made for television drama that starred Rod Steiger in the title role Marty piqued the interest of both Burt Lancaster and his producer partner Harold Hill. Rod Steiger had gotten very good reviews for his interpretation of the part of the thirty something Bronx butcher. However upon getting the film rights Lancaster himself did not want to cast Steiger again because he felt no one would see the film again after seeing Steiger on free television. Lancaster also personally cast Ernest Borgnine in the lead after having worked with him on From Here to Eternity.In 1955 Marty on television and the big screen struck a resonant cord with the American public. Something about the tale of the Bronx butcher longing anxiously for a life soul mate made it a universal theme about fear of loneliness. The plot such as it is has Marty going to the Stardust Ballroom and meeting plain jane school teacher Betsy Blair. Marty has a lot going against the relationship. His erstwhile friends as big a pack of losers ever created for the screen don't want to lose one of their number. His mother after listening to her sister changes from pushing him out the door to meet new people to strongly urging him to forget Betsy Blair. The conversation between the two women Esther Minciotti as Borgnine's mother and Agusta Ciolli as his Aunt Katherine is a classic.One of Marty's biggest boosters was columnist Walter Winchell. He plugged the film a lot in his column and was very instrumental in beating the publicity drums for Marty. Ironic since two years later Burt Lancaster delivered a cinema indictment against Winchell in playing Winchell clone J.J. Hunsecker in Sweet Smell of Success.No doubt Winchell helped because Marty scored with four Oscars. Best Picture of 1955 Best Actor Ernest Borgnine Best Director Delbert Mann and Best Adapted Screenplay Paddy Chayefsky. There were also nominations for Best Supporting Actress for Betsy Blair and Best Supporting Actor for Joe Mantell as Marty's 'friend' Angie.Though its mores are definitely ground in the Fifties Marty is a timeless tale that could easily be rewritten for the 21st centuries. There are still butchers in the Bronx and 30 something school teachers looking for love. It's what makes it universal.".

The film Marty won the academy award for best picture in 1955 and with the plethora of talent this movie possessed it is no wonder!! Ernest Borgnine is spectacular as the hard luck simpleton his reputation in Hollywood speaks for itself! Betsy Blair She was compelling in A Delicate Balance is a method actress who carries off her agitated emotions with a very subtle disposition! Jerry Paris Jerry on The Dick Van Dyke Show is a wealth of talent who was incredibly believable in this film! Many of the other actors and actresses with smaller roles in this movie were powerfully cogent as well! Paddy Chayefsky Most famous for Network who writes the screenplay has an amazing amount of talent regarding his ability to evoke heartfelt emotions which are esoteric in their comprehension!! The whole movie puts Ernest Borgnine on the spot to change the course of his floundering environment which was categorized by the negative associations to his cultural stereotype! To say that these two characters Ernest Borgnine and Betsy Blair were introverted would be a masterpiece of understatement!! The illtimed fiascoes of being loquacious one moment and taciturn the next became a volatile characteristic that obliterated the ground rules to casual dating!! The conversations with Ernest Borgnine and Betsy Blair always encompassed the visceral components of perseverance!! Trapped in a situation of a lower middle class environment of an emerging ethnicity the urge for Marty to necessitate a metamorphosis in his prevailing situation became an insurmountable obstacle course!! Ernest Borgnine's portliness was a good tool to convey his plight as the disgruntled curmudgeon who was perennially despondent! The uplifting insight to Marty meeting a girl for whom he liked and had a lot in common with became a necessary camaraderie that overcame circumstantial doubts and insecurities! Throughout this entire movie Paddy Chayefsky's writing effort itemizes reality and allows Marty to conquer adversity in a way that is thoroughly plausible! I liken this film to Rocky as both of these movies illustrate a boorish ItalianAmerican environment to be the single biggest form of societal intimidation! The unassuming demeanor to the genre of Marty became the most stellar characteristic to the picture's success! I was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful the film Marty was and I think anyone who has a curiosity about academy award winning films should definitely consider seeing this movie!!".

	schema:reviewBody "How wonderful to see that this movie was made on site in New York City not on some back lot in a studio. In this movie you can feel the sense of the City it is part of the movie itself.I am so happy that this movie was not made in color the black and white greyness of the story lends itself to the mood.Ernest Borgnine shines as the lonely 30ish man living with his widowed Italian mother going to his day job as a butcher. Hanging out with his other lonely bachelor friends. What do you want to do Marty? I don't know what do you want to do? Betsy Blair as Clara gives a believable performance as a lonely 30ish school teacher who is still living with her parents. She goes on a blind date to a dance with a cad who dumps her and she stands there on the sidelines as a wallflower which she is.Marty asks her to dance they strike up a conversation he takes her to his home where she meets his mother he takes her home by bus he realizes how much he cares for her! He says he will call but he does not.Then the middle of the story with his mother being threatened by the fact that Marty might just marry some day and desert her as her sister has been put out by her son and daughter in law. So much family angst here but love triumphs! The part I love the most is when Marty calls Clara at the end of the movie. Clara's face just lights up like a Christmas tree when Marty calls her. Such fabulous acting! I was rooting for them. I hope they had a happy and long marriage had kids whom Marty's mother embraced and made her happy in the last years of her life. One can only hope.I would give this 100 stars if I could.".

	onyx:emotionText "How wonderful to see that this movie was made on site in New York City not on some back lot in a studio. In this movie you can feel the sense of the City it is part of the movie itself.I am so happy that this movie was not made in color the black and white greyness of the story lends itself to the mood.Ernest Borgnine shines as the lonely 30ish man living with his widowed Italian mother going to his day job as a butcher. Hanging out with his other lonely bachelor friends. What do you want to do Marty? I don't know what do you want to do? Betsy Blair as Clara gives a believable performance as a lonely 30ish school teacher who is still living with her parents. She goes on a blind date to a dance with a cad who dumps her and she stands there on the sidelines as a wallflower which she is.Marty asks her to dance they strike up a conversation he takes her to his home where she meets his mother he takes her home by bus he realizes how much he cares for her! He says he will call but he does not.Then the middle of the story with his mother being threatened by the fact that Marty might just marry some day and desert her as her sister has been put out by her son and daughter in law. So much family angst here but love triumphs! The part I love the most is when Marty calls Clara at the end of the movie. Clara's face just lights up like a Christmas tree when Marty calls her. Such fabulous acting! I was rooting for them. I hope they had a happy and long marriage had kids whom Marty's mother embraced and made her happy in the last years of her life. One can only hope.I would give this 100 stars if I could.";

It's no wonder it won so many awards that year including 4 Oscars. In her autobiography Betsy Blair mentions that 'Marty' was the high point of her career it made her a movie star overnight and she was never again in anything as important though I thought her performance in 'A Delicate Balance' with Katherine Hepburn years later was even better. She won the BAFTA for her role here as did Ernest Borgnine who deservedly swept every award that year for his role as Marty including the Oscar and the Golden Globe. Borgnine is flawless in his performance  lovable from the very first scene. Esther Monciotti as his mother also delivers a standout performance. Some of the funniest and most memorable lines in the film belong to her and her onscreen sister. The rest of the supporting cast are also great to watch. The frank dialogue and the humanity of the characters make this a film you want to watch more than once.".

	schema:reviewBody "Paddy Chayefsky's simple yet beautiful tale about life and love in the 1950s New York era is certainly lovely to watch and one of the more lovable classics of the Golden Era. Ernest Borgnine is perfect as Marty a thirtyfour year old butcher living with his mother but he's not unemployed or in the basement living on his laptop. He is a hardworking man determined to make a good life for himself and his mother. The unfortunate thing is that he is still single and the feeling that he will always be single bothers him as well as his mother.Then he goes to a dance on Saturday night and meets someone who is in a very similar situation Clara a lonely twentynine year old schoolteacher who lives with her father and feels as if she will never get hitched. This chance encounter blossoms into a lovely relationship in only a few hours. And as the film progresses we get to know these characters more and start to hope that they will end up together as we know they are perfect for each other.In the film's final act it appears that everybody around Marty seems to take a dislike toward Clara. His mother feels he getting married will throw her out of the house as it did with her sister. His friends all see her as a 'dog' and convince Marty for awhile to shun her and move on. Only in the very end do we see our hero rise up and realize that he had one of the best nights of his life with this dog and he intends to do so again. In the final scene he turns the table on his friend by beginning to ask him when he's going to get married. The films ends on a bit ambiguous note but we are satisfied enough to know that these two people will meet again.All in all this is a wonderful and charming slice of life that does not become dated despite what people may say. The themes are universal and timeless and this story summarizes the feelings and desires that rise up in all of us as human beings determined to live a long and happy life.".

Everyone who buys a pork chop gives him grief over his bachlerhood and that extends to his Mother too.  He is a sweet guy  loans money to his friends is polite to strangers and considerate to his family.  He is a little lonely and frustrated and doesn't have much to do. One night in a dance hall a stranger offers him 5 to take a girl home since the guy doesn't want to have anything to do with this particular girl. Marty is amazed at the rudeness so to not humiliate the girl any more than she has to be and since he's alone anyway..they meet and dance and have a very nice night.  He is very nervous and has a lot to say and sometimes rambles on a little.  Not the worse crime in the world.There is a small subplot over Marty's Aunt moving in with Marty and his Mom since she does not get along with her daughterinlaw.  I suppose this is to show that even if you are married life still hands out problems.  And if you get to live long enough to be considered 'old' that sometimes you are uprooted and unwanted and a bit of a burden to your family. Borgnine is terrific and won Best Actor over pretty tough competition.  Joe Mandell as Angie Marty's best friend and Betsy Blair as Clara who is the girl he meets were also nominated.  This material was originally a television 'play' starring Rod Steiger as Marty and Nancy Marchand as Clara.  I bet it was good.  810.".

However they come up against the gossip social pressure and expectations of family and friends that hold them back from their natural instinct to marry and love one another. Both are older by the standards of the time but that does not stop them from wanting someone special. They are both excited about the prospect of spending their lives together and then there is a pause as the elation runs up against reality. Borgnine and Blair are excellent in the role of a young couple who desire to break away from the bonds of friends and family to form their own home life. How will it turn out? This movie is a departure from the glossy Hollywood movies of the 1950's that used colour and celebrity talent and lacked the realism and honesty of this classic. Marty was a more mature movie with a more effective treatment of social divisions and complicated relationships. Paddy Chayefsky wrote the script and Burt Lancaster was the producer. Both were creative forces in the film world of the 1950's. Delbert Mann directed he also directed other fine movies such as Separate Tables and Middle of the Night. This is a precious film with a place in the history of American cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1968 I was just 22 years old and driving a taxi parttime in Ft. Lee New Jersey. One day I drove Charles Jackson author of The Lost Weekend from Englewood Cliffs NJ to a rundown hotel in Times Square New York City. I had seen and really liked the movie of the same name starring Ray Milland who did a wonderful job portraying an alcoholic on a weekend binge. The film was so realistic I had a strong feeling that Charles Jackson had written the book based on his own life. I got up the nerve to ask him and he told me that....yes he indeed was the alcoholic portrayed in his book. We talked quite a bit about his life on the way into Times Square. He seemed like a very nice person although he seemed quite depressed. However it still came as quite a shock when shortly after having him in my cab I read in the papers that he had hung himself in his hotel room in NYC. That's an experience I will never forget!".

It was a landmark film in its time and still isthere is no question about its holding power and the excellence of writing acting and direction. Yes even by today's standards! It outclasses more recent films dealing with alcoholism as it focuses on one man's problem with the bottlea problem that affects all of the people whose lives he touchesparticularly his loyal girlfriend Jane Wyman in one of her best roles and Philip Terry as his more conventional brother. The emotions are stark and real. The pity we feel for Milland's character is also mixed with disgust for his weakness. It's an accurate depiction of an alcoholic's struggle for the next fixa never ending search for the next bottle. The pseudobabble of a previous commentator attempts to inject disdain for the film as outdated and outclassed by more serious works. Nonsense! This was a stark and powerful film in 1945 and I have news for youit is just as powerful and timely today! No other American film comes close to it. It is as searing an indictment of alcoholism as you are ever likely to see and Milland fully deserved his Oscar.".

They solely concentrate on the illness rather than on the cause of it. Of course in many cases the cause cannot be helped...In The Lost Weekend we accompany the failed writer Don Birnam Ray Milland surrendering to the selfdestructive nature of his addiction.

The brand doesn't matter the cheaper the better  to him it's all the same. Drinking seems to be his only way to escape from his misery and low selfesteem. Suddenly I'm above the ordinary.

That's what a drunk Don tells his favourite barkeeper Nat Howard Da Silva.Yet in one aspect he is lucky. Unlike many of his fellow sufferers he is not alone. After years of abuse his faithful girlfriend Helen Jane Wyman and his brother Wick Phillip Terry have still not deserted him. Compassionately they do their utmost to protect Don from himself by keeping him under close observation. With great effort they determined the most inventive hidingplaces of his bottles and they even visited nearby liquor stores and bars begging not to accept Don as a customer.

Soon he is stone drunk staggering through the streets always on the lookout for the next drink. For Don there will be no weekend trip. Only the bottle and the desperate humiliations connected with attaining it.The Lost Weekend is a a drama of great emotional vehemence lacking the light heartedness of Billy Wilder's later works. It gives unclouded insight into the darkest corners of alcoholism and depicts the powerlessness of the alcoholic over himself. Wilder created great controversy at that time by letting the lead actor succumb to his addiction. He didn't shy away from showing the addict's humiliations when begging for money or booze. Neither did he hesitate to point out the addict's loss of all selfrespect when stealing and lying to pay for his one need. The horrifying hallucination scene only adds up to the disturbing decline of Don Birnam's humanity proving that the greatest horrors lie within our imagination.This is an excellent film of lasting relevance. It is technically brilliant and shines with great dialogue which is typical for Wilder. Its storytelling flashbacks is superior. Furthermore Ray Millard Dial M for Murder gives a terrific and equally courageous performance as the the selfdestructive alcoholic. You can see the desperate selfloathing and calculating slyness of a true addict written on his face. In the end it comes down to two choices. Don can give in to alcoholism and thereby give up on life. Or he can try to overcome his addiction and face his fears and discontentment. Although sheer willpower may not be enough to achieve the latter it is essential for succeeding. And the cause isn't lost for there is Helen to help and care for him. Don is not alone.

	schema:reviewBody "The American cinema can count itself lucky with the wave of arrival of the best European talent in the days prior to World War II. Among the most distinguished directors that came to Hollywood was Billy Wilder who left a legacy not only as a director but in the many screen plays he wrote. One of his great works was The Lost Weekend. Written with Charles Brackett one of his most frequent collaborators this is a film that dared to talk about a thing that no one dared to speak before alcoholism.If you haven't seen the film please stop reading now.On the opening scene of the picture we watch Don Birman and his brother Wick packing suitcases for a long weekend in the country. We realize not everything is all right as we watch a bottle tied with a piece of string hanging out of a window. It's clear to see what was wrong with that picture Don is an alcoholic! Wick having enough common sense wants to keep his brother near him in order to control the situation.Things get complicated with the arrival of Helen the woman in love with Don. Helen St. James has been in a relationship with Don that has gone nowhere because of his drinking problem. Helen as well as Wick don't have the courage to have him committed to have him cured of his addiction. In fact both are to blame about the condition affecting Don but neither realize how deep is the problem. In 1945 themes involving addiction were never told to the movie going public. Alcoholism was a vice that affected a lot of people in the country but those were the days where people with drinking problems stayed in the closet not daring to recognize how their lives were being ruined by the heavy use of alcohol.We watch in horror as Don spends a weekend in hell going from one scheme to the next trying to get money to support his nasty habit. We also see Don Birman experience the worst night of his life when he is taken to a hospital after falling down from a staircase. There he sees first hand the horrors his addictions will bring to him. In a way the exposure to the men in the hospital is a wake up call for Don who decides to end it all because drinking has taken over his life. The movie should be seen by anyone suffering from this terrible social disease. Ray Milland transforms himself into this troubled man. He gives an incredible performance. Mr. Milland has to be given credit in undertaking the portrayal of this lost soul in such a convincing fashion. By Hollywood standards Ray Milland an actor better known for his work in comedies transforms himself into this Don Birman. The supporting cast was excellent as well. Jane Wyman as Helen St. James is seen in one of her better roles of her career. Phillip Terry as Wick the kind brother is also good. Howard DaSilva the bartender Nat makes an impressive appearance in the film. Doris Dowling as Gloria the friendly prostitute is equally effective.Of course this is a movie that shows Billy Wilder at his best. By filming on location in Manhattan a rich texture is added. From Nat's bar we can watch the trams that circulated on Third Ave. at that time as well as the 3rd. Av. El. The excellent black and white cinematography of John Seitz looks as good today as it must have looked in 1945 when the film was released. The music score by the great Milos Rozsa is haunting without being too obvious.This is without a doubt one of Billy Wilder's best movies one that endures the passing of time. Mr. Wilder dared to speak out loud about something no one wanted to talk about.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a very sobering story pun somewhat intended but not to make light of a serious problem. Stories about alcoholism can be really depressing but I found this simply a fascinating account of what an alcoholic goes through. I doubt if any film since this as been as effective in telling its sordid story but not in a sordid manner.The acting is excellent led by Ray Milland's performance and complemented by memorable supporting turns by Howard da Silva Doris Dowling Frank Faylen Phillip Terry and Jane Wyman.I particularly enjoyed the characters played by Faylen da Silva and Dowling. Faylen had only one scene but it's a beauty. As a hospital aide he gives Milland a short but riveting speech that still haunts me when I recall it. Dowling served up some great film noirtype dialog and was a sexy woman at least in this picture and da Silva was perfect as the bartender.This is an involving story and has a few spots with some good cinematography too. Another plus is the fact that it doesn't appear dated even though it is 60 years old. How many films can say that? The only flaw I thought was the ending. Anyone has hooked on booze to the degree Milland was in this film would not be able to just quit like that....but happyending movies are usually what work. Speaking of happy what man wouldn't want a woman as loyal and supportive as Wyman's character was in here? In an age in which commitment and loyalty are not considered valuable character traits as they used to be she was inspiring to watchI hope this film's reputation encourages a few people who need to see and hear this message to take a look. They don't have to worry about a boring heavy handed message. This is just plain interesting and always entertaining. It earned all the awards it received.".

I doubt if any film since this as been as effective in telling its sordid story but not in a sordid manner.The acting is excellent led by Ray Milland's performance and complemented by memorable supporting turns by Howard da Silva Doris Dowling Frank Faylen Phillip Terry and Jane Wyman.I particularly enjoyed the characters played by Faylen da Silva and Dowling. Faylen had only one scene but it's a beauty. As a hospital aide he gives Milland a short but riveting speech that still haunts me when I recall it. Dowling served up some great film noirtype dialog and was a sexy woman at least in this picture and da Silva was perfect as the bartender.This is an involving story and has a few spots with some good cinematography too. Another plus is the fact that it doesn't appear dated even though it is 60 years old. How many films can say that? The only flaw I thought was the ending. Anyone has hooked on booze to the degree Milland was in this film would not be able to just quit like that....but happyending movies are usually what work. Speaking of happy what man wouldn't want a woman as loyal and supportive as Wyman's character was in here? In an age in which commitment and loyalty are not considered valuable character traits as they used to be she was inspiring to watchI hope this film's reputation encourages a few people who need to see and hear this message to take a look. They don't have to worry about a boring heavy handed message. This is just plain interesting and always entertaining. It earned all the awards it received.";

The great thing about his performance and the film as a whole is that his face will gradually change becoming dark and chilly just like Stewart's in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. Stewart had lost his life momentarily.

He just can't stop and we start to lose whatever sympathy we had for him because of how he treats other people.  This is a drunk with a sober man wanting to come out but Wilder's script dives deeply into the unpredictable outcomes of most alcoholics.LOST WEEKEND was innovative and was almost never released because test audiences could not take the film's realism.  The hospital sequence retains its horror and Milland's withdrawalinduced hallucination of a rat in the wall was like him looking in the mirror.  See this movie and you will come away with a completely informed and scary anthology of the antics of a hopeless alcoholic.  This is amazing considering it came out of the old Hollywood system.".

In many ways we may have progressed but I'm not sure I've ever seen a movie that treats alcoholism with the honesty it gets here.But The Lost Weekend isn't just a message movie it's superbly crafted as well easily the equal of Billy Wilder's other films Double Indemnity Sunset Blvd. Stalag 17 Sabrina etc.. According to the production notes Wilder read the novel by Charles R. Jackson and took it upon himself to convince his producers to let him make the film knowing it would be a hit and win the leading man an Oscar. That's vision coupled with uncanny filmmaking skill.Ray Milland never gave a finer performance the progression of his character throughout the movie is extraordinary and a lesser actor simply wouldn't have been able to pull it off. I doubt he was Hollywood's first alcoholic wouldbe writer but he certainly raised the bar for the many who'd follow in his footsteps. He never once resorts to stereotypical drunk stockcharacter. His eye movements and highflown selfdelusional speeches alone make the film worth watching.While this film is imminently deserving of the four major Oscars it scooped up Best Picture Best Director Best Screenplay and Best Actor it didn't win for Best Cinematography which is a shame. John F. Seitz's blackandwhite cinematography is a visual feast. Seitz was nominated for the Oscar seven times between 1930 and 1955 including four Wilder pictures but regrettably never won. In all he was the principal cinematographer for 159 films including such other classics such as Sullivan's Travels This Gun for Hire The Miracle of Morgan's Creek The Big Clock Night Has A Thousand Eyes and When Worlds Collide. DANGER! SPOILER AHEAD!  I'm not nearly so optimistic about Don's recovery as most other reviewers seem to be. Overtly the the Hollywood ending is all there Don drops a cigarette into a glass of whiskey he and Helen have the big kiss he sits down to finally crank out his big book. Call it pessimism but I think it's all tied up so neatly that it can't help but unravel for him five minutes after the cameras leave.

We've seen some pretty good films since like I'll Cry Tomorrow right up to Barfly but The Lost Weekend still has the power to hold the audiences attention 61 years after it came out.It was a breakthrough film for its star Ray Milland. Previously someone who had done light leading man roles Milland plumbed some real hidden demons in the role of Don Birnam. A guy much like the characters Ray Milland played on screen Birnam is a charming fellow and would be writer who can't leave the alcohol alone.Billy Wilder was going to originally cast an unknown character actor in the lead role. However Paramount producer Buddy DeSylva said that in this part you wanted a likable leading man so the audiences had a rooting interest. Wilder who usually did not suffer interference from the front office with any grace took DeSylva's advice and got Ray Milland with whom he'd worked with in The Major and the Minor.Milland prepared for this part by spending a couple of nights in an alcoholic ward. Certainly showed in his performance. You will not forget Milland and his reaction to seeing the bat and the mouse while in delirium tremors.Jane Wyman was Wilder's third choice after not getting Katharine Hepburn or Jean Arthur. She came over to Paramount from Warner Brothers on a loan out and got her first really good notices for a serious acting role as Milland's long suffering girl friend.A recent biography of Billy Wilder said that The Lost Weekend was timed perfectly for an audience that swelled up with returning servicemen some of whom developed alcoholic problems after being through the horror of a World War. After being panned in previews with a little editing it opened to rave reviews on release.It did good at the box office too and it won Oscars for Best Picture Best Actor for Milland Best Screenplay for Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett and Best Director for Wilder. After this triumph Wilder and Brackett both had their pick of good film properties.I'm surprised that someone like Robert DeNiro Dustin Hoffman or Al Pacino has never tried to remake this one. Seems like just the kind of film for them.Milland's character is a writer and a key sequence is when he attempts to pawn his typewriter for a bottle of booze. Can you imagine doing that today with a laptop computer which is not only the tool he uses but also has a memory of all the attempts the protagonist has made to write.

	schema:reviewBody "With every glass of whisky that Don Birnam drinks a little part of him dies. This everexpanding rift in his soul only increases his thirst as though only through alcohol can he recover the parts of himself that he abandoned a long time ago. Drinking is his means of escaping reality of creating a debilitating illusion of happiness and satisfaction it tosses the sandbags overboard so the balloon can soar. Suddenly I'm above the ordinary. I'm competent. I'm walking a tightrope over Niagara Falls. I'm one of the great ones Similarly Ray Milland's portrayal of a chronic alcoholic in Billy Wilder's Oscarwinning 'The Lost Weekend 1945' is one of the great performances of its era and the film itself is one fivedaylong nightmare of obsession and desperation. Prior to 1945 Hollywood had shied away from confronting alcohol addiction in a serious light more content with exploiting the issue for comedic effect take Nick Charles of 'The Thin Man' series for example or any movie featuring the stereotypical clumsy and amusing drunkard. It took a promising newcomer in Billy Wilder fresh from the classic filmnoir 'Double Indemnity 1944 to finally bring alcoholism into the open for all to see.'The Lost Weekend' was adapted by Wilder and Charles Brackett from Charles R. Jackson's novel of the same name itself a rather daring and provocative piece of literature. The film follows alcoholic Don Birnam throughout a torturous fiveday long weekend as he futilely battles his addiction to the bottle and suffers the consequences of his excessive drinking. The film borrows a thing or two from German Expressionism and much of the film has a peculiar dreamlike atmosphere to it accentuated by stark lighting and shadows beautifully shot by cinematographer John F. Seitz. This hazy otherworldly ambiance is further emphasised by the inspired decision to film some scenes through glass liquor bottles and Mikls Rzsa's eerie soundtrack which made extensive use of the oscillating wail of the theremin nowadays mostly associated with films dealing with extraterrestrials and UFOs. One particular hallucinatory sequence featuring a mouse and a bat has undoubtedly left its mark on all who watch the film and Birnam's frenzied scream of absolute horror will continue to resonate in your eardrums long after it's all over.Along with Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining 1980' and the Coen Brothers' 'Barton Fink 1991' 'The Lost Weekend' is probably the most disturbing film about writer's block that I've seen a genuinely unsettling profile of a troubled and mentallyill man. The film doesn't merely present us with Don Birnam but takes us into his world where slipping your fingers around that next shot of whisky is a matter of life or death. Though the Production Code forced Wilder to supply a more optimistic ending than I think he would have liked he nonetheless manages to slip some ambiguity into the final moments and on second look the conclusion isn't perhaps as hopeful as we might initially have presumed. In an earlier scene Birnam refers to his alcohol addiction as my little vicious circle no end no beginning. Indeed throughout the weekend he experiences a continuous sequence of cycles circulating between debilitating drunkenness an attempt at recovery and a frantic search for more alcohol. The film opens with a lefttoright slow pan from the New York cityscape to Birnam's apartment it closes with an identical pan in the opposite direction. Despite his apparent resolve to finally emerge from his rut and complete The Bottle it appears that Birnam is simply trapped in a vicious cycle from which he may never escape except perhaps in death.".

Though the Production Code forced Wilder to supply a more optimistic ending than I think he would have liked he nonetheless manages to slip some ambiguity into the final moments and on second look the conclusion isn't perhaps as hopeful as we might initially have presumed. In an earlier scene Birnam refers to his alcohol addiction as my little vicious circle no end no beginning. Indeed throughout the weekend he experiences a continuous sequence of cycles circulating between debilitating drunkenness an attempt at recovery and a frantic search for more alcohol. The film opens with a lefttoright slow pan from the New York cityscape to Birnam's apartment it closes with an identical pan in the opposite direction. Despite his apparent resolve to finally emerge from his rut and complete The Bottle it appears that Birnam is simply trapped in a vicious cycle from which he may never escape except perhaps in death.";

Most of us have seen the drunk at the end of the bar with grandiose ideas and romanticized visions amid that need nevermind enjoyment of the booze. But the film is successful if only because it makes this obsession with the flailing writer Don as his major internal conflict and that it goes deeper to something that is in many of us even if we don't drink.Basically Don wants to get off alcohol so he can write his great book. Despite some advice from the friendly enemy as I would call one local bartender and the girl Gloria there is little hope for him it seems. He goes on a fourday bender looking frantically all over the apartment when it's not in easy reach. This all leads up to going clean which involves a truly paranoidfilmed sequence by Wilder one of his very best.It is almost all harrowing drama and only in the minute moments when Don is completely unsympathetic does the film lose some of its momentum. But really the film is as much about the psychology of this man of the writer in desperation though never wanting to admit it and Ray Milland's performance at least for the time was daring enough to show as much as could be shown at the time. The film probes just enough into the subject matter to not become very preachy I don't think Wilder's message is to never drink ever as much as one of keeping control of one's life and system and at the core is just entertaining drama.".

	schema:reviewBody "When people talk about Billy Wilder it's always films like Sunset Blvd Double Indemnity and The Apartment that get the praise. There is a good reason for this as these films are out and out masterpieces but The Lost Weekend is at least on par with them. The Lost Weekend is a film about addiction and it's tribulations shown through the story of an alcoholic. Through a fantastic screenplay Wilder is able to make the audience feel all the stress and pain of the central characters which makes for a very powerful film to watch. It's even uncomfortable at times. Wilder presents the central character of Don Birnam as a likable character he's a talented writer and he comes across as being funny and charismatic the only problem is that he has a drink problem and the problem consumes him. The character is flawed but he's not flawed due to his personality the flaw is in the addiction and that's the key to this film. By differentiating between the two we can like the character but we hate the problem thus allowing the potency of the film's premise to be increased by our empathy for the character.Billy Wilder is well known for great screenplays his films are some of the most well rounded ever made and that trademark is more than evident in this film. Every scene serves some importance and lets us delve deeper into the character and his situation. Some scenes really stand out such as the sequence that sees Birnam and his girlfriend to be Helen St James meeting after mistakenly picking up each other's coats. The scene that set's up the pair's relationship is simple but believable and also very funny. The acting in the film is truly first rate especially that coming from Ray Milland in the lead role. Millard is sublime in the role of an alcoholic his every word and mannerism are perfectly suited to the character of a drunk. Wilder tends to get the best from his actors and that is definitely true of this film. I dare say that if you put Milland next to an actual alcoholic you'd have trouble telling who is and who isn't the true addict.Wilder's direction like his screenplay is magnificent. The cinematography is superb and really captures the seedy atmosphere of a drunken man's city. Wilder's use of music is superb he has opted for a theme that sounds almost like something that would be played in a SciFi film when the flying saucers come down. This music might sound like it would be out of place in a film of this nature but it actually works brilliantly. Never doubt a decision made by Billy Wilder the music creates a foreboding and apprehensive atmosphere and coupled with Birnam's drunkenness the two come together to great effect.Don't pass this film over despite it's lack of recognition this is one of Wilder's best films. A masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "Up to THE LOST WEEKEND Billy Wilder was a talented script writer from Austria who had done after some noise and badgering several movies that he and Charles Brackett wrote the scripts for but the way he felt they were intended. So Paramount let him go ahead and produce and direct their own films and he proved the studio was wise to do so.By 1945 Wilder had done a wacky comedy THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR about a military academy. The film was a box office success. It was followed by FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO which gave a fictional account of the war in North Africa and gave a stunningly good performance by Eric Von Stroheim as General Erwin Rommel. But Wilder and Brackett wanted to tackle a message picture. They found one in the best selling novel THE LOST WEEKEND by Charles Jackson. It tackled the issue of alcoholism. Alcoholism had actually been noted in motion pictures almost from the start usually in comedies where a character possibly the star like Chaplin in ONE A.M. would do his or her business while tanked. The 19th Century drama THE DRUNKARD was used by W.C. Fields in THE OLD FASHIONED WAY as the play Fields' troop is putting on. Another version of THE DRUNKARD was made into a full movie in 1940 called THE VILLAIN STILL PURSUES HER with Alan Mowbray and Buster Keaton. Now and then a more serious problem would be shown. D.W.Griffith made his last film in 1931 about alcoholism THE STRUGGLE which was a flop. In SADIE MCGEE Joan Crawford marries Edward Arnold who is an alcoholic she eventually helps on this problem. Aside from Griffith's flop nobody made a serious film about the disease. Wilder and Brackett turned in a good screenplay that did just that.Don Birnan is a young man who claims to be a writer but has published very little. Three people are aware of his weakness Don's older brother Wic the local bartender Nat and Don's girlfriend Helen.The crisis occurs the last weekend of the summer. Don is to go with Wic and work on his novel. But he disappears when he is supposed to be ready to leave. Wic has rearranged his own life for Don and is fed up. He leaves to go to the country house alone. He tells Helen not to waste her own life with Don as Don is so far gone that he is not worth it. Helen more troubled than Wic does make herself scarce too. So Don when he gets home finds that he is really all alone on that long weekend. Well not totally alone  he's inventive our Don. He hides bottles of liquor all over the house the old joke about the whiskey bottle hidden in a chandelier comes from this film. Wic does try to find the hiding places but Don comes up with new ones including suspending a bottle from a window by a string. However even this is of little use as Don's demons drive him deeper and deeper into drinking. He has little money left and soon is out of credit at Nat's who hates to give him credit for drink because it's harmful to Don. He even steals a purse at one point. He tries to hock his typewriter. All for the money for a drink. And then he ends up in Bellevue's Drunk Tank where he meets the cynical nurse Bim who has heard all the remorseful stories of reform from Don and his ilk forever.There is far more to the screenplay than this synopsis suggests. Don's behavior is centered only on getting the sauce into him  and he does not care who is inconvenienced along the way so that he finds himself quite isolated by the conclusion of the film. The movie's ending is hopeful but just vaguely that. Somehow Don is such a weak character we can not be sure if he will ever turn his life around again.Wilder used Ray Milland in this film and it is usually pointed out that Milland was normally in comedies like EASY LIVING SKYLARK or Wilder's own THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR. But he had played serious parts most notably in BEAU GESTE I WANTED WINGS and more recently THE MINISTRY OF FEAR and THE UNINVITED. But Don Birnan was the first three dimensional figure he tackled and he did splendidly in it. His Oscar guaranteed a decade of stardom and a really interesting career afterward in directing and character parts. Jane Wyman plays Helen as a character who struggles to recall the man she loves up to the conclusion of the film  his weakness constantly threatening the relationship. Philip Terry's Wic is equally good putting on the best face possible until the straw breaks the camel's back. As Bim Frank Faylen is understandably fed up with his ward charges at Bellevue  all claiming they aren't ill but quite evidently recurring so. And Howard Da Silva normally playing villains in the 1940s played the understanding Nat as harsh but compassionate  he wants Don to straighten up and write as he claims he can. How real is the story here? There is an anecdote that Milland mentions in WILD EYED IN BABYLON where he and Da Silva were in the set of the bar rehearsing a scene. They were interrupted by a bowler hatted little man with a familiar face who came in and ordered a shot of whiskey. He paid for it gulped it down before the two actors and left the bar. They watched him go and did not say a word. It was Robert Benchley working on another picture at Paramount at the next set. And Benchley had his own alcohol problems too.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't imagine how this got greenlit back in 1945. It's almost impossible to imagine a film like this being made back then  the era where women weren't allowed to have their dresses crease around their buttocks and show the shape of their behinds as Carl Reiner put it on commentary for the Dick Van Dyke show.Seen sixty ! years later it still holds up amazingly well. A great deal of films from the 1940s and '50s seem outdated today but the issue of alcoholism will probably never die... and as long as it exists this movie will remain prescient.Ray Milland delivers a powerful performance as Don Birnem a recovering alcoholic whose girlfriend Helen Jane Wyman and brother Wick Phillip Terry have planned a weekend getaway to the country to take his mind off the booze.Don makes up an excuse not to go  he says he wants to be alone. His brother is suspicious of his decision but nevertheless leaves without him. After the two leave Don pulls a bottle of alcohol through his window which was tied to a string by the window sill hidden from view outside the apartment.Don makes his daily visit to the bar where Nat Da Silva the Bartender serves his drinks. The more he drinks the more Don spirals downwards into a hellish nightmare complete with flashbacks to his past where he is reminded of the destructive patterns of his addiction.I bought this movie a few months ago out of curiosity mainly because I saw it had been directed by Billy Wilder. Wilder is most commonly known for his comedies like The Apartment and Some Like It Hot but here he shows he has a great eye for drama.This is a superb film on all levels. The themes are gripping and important the acting is totally uncompromising and the direction is top notch. I'd say it's one of the best and most underrated films of the 1940s I had personally never heard of it before... I'm glad I stumbled across it.".

	onyx:emotionText "I can't imagine how this got greenlit back in 1945. It's almost impossible to imagine a film like this being made back then  the era where women weren't allowed to have their dresses crease around their buttocks and show the shape of their behinds as Carl Reiner put it on commentary for the Dick Van Dyke show.Seen sixty ! years later it still holds up amazingly well. A great deal of films from the 1940s and '50s seem outdated today but the issue of alcoholism will probably never die... and as long as it exists this movie will remain prescient.Ray Milland delivers a powerful performance as Don Birnem a recovering alcoholic whose girlfriend Helen Jane Wyman and brother Wick Phillip Terry have planned a weekend getaway to the country to take his mind off the booze.Don makes up an excuse not to go  he says he wants to be alone. His brother is suspicious of his decision but nevertheless leaves without him. After the two leave Don pulls a bottle of alcohol through his window which was tied to a string by the window sill hidden from view outside the apartment.Don makes his daily visit to the bar where Nat Da Silva the Bartender serves his drinks. The more he drinks the more Don spirals downwards into a hellish nightmare complete with flashbacks to his past where he is reminded of the destructive patterns of his addiction.I bought this movie a few months ago out of curiosity mainly because I saw it had been directed by Billy Wilder. Wilder is most commonly known for his comedies like The Apartment and Some Like It Hot but here he shows he has a great eye for drama.This is a superb film on all levels. The themes are gripping and important the acting is totally uncompromising and the direction is top notch. I'd say it's one of the best and most underrated films of the 1940s I had personally never heard of it before... I'm glad I stumbled across it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Up until The Lost Weekend alcoholism was seldom seriously addressed by Hollywood. So in that sense it is an important groundbreaking film. Also unlike past portrayals of drinking such as W. C. Fields in films this is much more realistic and grittyparticularly when they show people in the hospital going through the agonies of withdrawal. This is the BEST aspect of the movie along with all the broken promises and games Milland plays with those around him.Unfortunately the movie HAD to slap a pat ending on the film as movies seldom were allowed to end on a sour or indefinite note in the 1940s. Don't get me wrong I LOVE cinema of the 1940s far more than recent movies but this was one serious shortcoming films of that era hadthe Hollywood ending even when it was not realistic or sometimes compromised the integrity of the film as in this case. Milland after a long weekend bender announces he's now got it licked and everything is peachy! Give me a breakthis sure sounds like the phony selfserving thinking I so often encountered when I worked with addicts in a substance abuse program!! This is only the first step in a long difficult road to recovery.For an even better film about alcoholism try Days of Wine and Roses.".

	schema:headline " Stunning Screen Depiction Of Alcoholism";
	schema:reviewBody "A landmark film at it's time of release for it's stark depiction of alcoholism 'The Lost Weekend' has been somewhat forgotten over the years even labelled 'dated'. My theory is that every film becomes dated after it's first day of release nothing ever stays the same. 'The Lost Weekend' is hardly an old relic from a bygone era though. Alcoholism is still a major problem for many 'ordinary folk' out there. Milland's stunning performance and Wilder's assured directorial skills combine to make a film that is as relevant today as it was back in 1945.It's relevant because Milland's dive into the depths of drinking hell is treated so carefully so earnestly. Every scene has a realistic feelthe alcoholics ward at the hospital and Milland's desperate search for a drink could have been played up to add to the drama but they are kept in measure instead. While 'Days Of Wine and Roses' thrusts the problem in our faces somewhat Wilder's film asks the viewer to think and make their own judgement. It was a revolutionary film at the time of it's release for the portrayal of the alcoholic writer Don Birnam Milland. Before this film alcoholics on screen were usually one of two sorts 1. Dirty slovenly lecherous layabouts 2. Jovial hefty old men who took a swing always in a merry and gregarious manner Birnam shatters the myth. This man could be your nextdoor neighbour your brother your college chum because he feels so REAL. He's a talented guy We hear how he was touted as being the next Hemingway but he's ultimately an ordinary guy the nice young man who drinks. Milland is rather like James Stewart here both in looks and acting style. He's the everyman which makes his downfall even more painful and harrowing to watch.There is a nice contrast here between the boozy romanticism of addiction and the awful aftermath. Birnam tells how he has delusions of grandeur when he drinks he's confident assured ready to take on the whole world. We are drawn into Don's hazy alcoholic dreams until the morning after when he is slumped broken and unable to function. Both sides of the coin are being shown which makes it easier to empathise with Don's position.Don's drinking is not presented as his largest problem here it is his lack of selfesteem his inability to believe in himself and his own selfworth that make him turn to drink. So we look at the causes of alcoholism here also not just the results. Wilder maintains an appropriately gloomy moody atmosphere throughout with some very nice camera work. Note the foggy haze that envelops the screen when Birnam sinks into despair the use of superimposition with the coats and bottle etc. The 'mouse and bat' scene is painful to watch as is Milland's reaction. Wilder's view of life on the edge is enough to turn anyone off alcohol to see the bigger picture.Milland gives one of the best male acting performances you'll ever see as Don Birnam. He deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Actor for an amazing turn. Wyman is also great as Don's sympathetic girlfriend Helen who has more faith and determination that anyone I've seen. To some she may seem a forceful character very clich and sentimental but the role and Wyman's performance is one of the things I just love about this film. Fine supporting work from Phillip Terry Howard Da Silva and Doris Dowling round out the cast. Dowling's Gloria is obviously a callgirl but with the Production Code in place this is skirted around. Excellent film 1010.".

He fears learning about the common man or anything else outside his experience. His experience  teems with material for a watchful writer but Barton sees nothing. When the wallpaper peels he doesn't look for what's underneath or an explanation he feverishly tries to cover up what's exposed as fast as he can uno metaphoro. I agree with all comments about Goodman presenting Barton with a common man right in his own room. He has a research subject to learn from and to use as a springboard to break through his writer's block but he can't see anything that god presents for him to use. And the Woman on the Beach. Interesting that he never sees her face. He can never really SEE her but seems drawn to her and fascinated by her. He is drawn to the fact that she is unseeable. In the end he sees her and doesn't explore that possibility either. The Box? He never opens it. We assume what we want to assume but Barton who is in control ! simply attaches to the box without ever discovering it. He is all show and no substance. I agree his one hit the play may be all he has in him. He's a onetrick pony posing as a seeking writer intent on revealing the inner common man but is petrified by fear ignorance or whatyouwill. Look at the film again with an eye to his inability to see what is clearly revealed to him. you may see what I mean! Cheers!".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently purchased Barton Fink along with Miller's Crossinhg another Coen Brothers gem.Barton Fink quite simply is a writer who cannot see the forest for the trees. He is so taken with the fact that he is a writer that he can't write. He is so idealistic that he misses fantastic opportunities to become a writer for the ages because he wastes precious time proselytizing. John Goodman perfectly sums up everyone's frustration with Barton Fink when after a series of unfortunate occurrences Barton asks him Why me? to which John's character answers Because you don't LISTEN! Set in 1930s Hollywood we follow the exploits of a onehit wonder Barton Fink who has written a successful Broadway play and is summoned by the powers that be to Hollywood. After much cajoling to take the job from his agent Barton arrives in Los Angeles determined to become the writer for the common man where he insists true stories live. The trouble with Barton however is he does not have time for the common man because he has so romanticized their lot as well as his particular quest in speaking for them.Excellent performances from John Turturo John Goodman Judy Davis John Polito often overlooked but his scenes ALWAYS become his!! and the inimitable Tony Shaloub.I have decided after a slew of Coen Brothers films I currently have in my collection that any project these guys are involved with deserve more than passing scrutiny.".

Here is THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS MASTERPIECE MOVIE...Those that stated that the first 23 of the movie is boring and then it starts to pick up when the action begins have unwittingly seen the plot and masterfully fulfilled its premise. See Barton Fink is a boring artsy impassioned Jewish writer that gets one lucky break and is instantly summoned to write a movie that the execs are sure will be a winner no pressure there right Hollywood?. But since he is so much an artist he cannot lower himself to the level of writing a simple wrestling film desiring instead to write witty stories about the common man films that really mean something. Then he refuses to listen to common man stories stuck instead on his own ideas of what that should be. Well OK what is obvious here? Well the Coens for one are Jewish WRITERS FILMMAKERS who got one lucky break Blood Simple and then were given the open door to make Hollywood films are always branded as mere artists too idealistic for the majority of the masses their movies are rarely fully appreciated or understood and make only a small profit but their genius high critic ratings keeps them afloat. So THEY ARE Barton Fink quite literally and intentionally. It is THEIR personal tale ensconced in a symbolic cloak. Summary Barton wants to write for the common man and yet what the common man wants to see is this dumb Brated wrestling flick not some heartfelt idealistic piece about some friendly yokel. They want predictable mystery unadulterated violence and blood guns blazing detectives crunching and loud sex. As Barton stares at the image of his idealism the beach picture he longs for his ill conceived idealism to take form and materialize onto the paper. But of course it is a failure because he sees himself as an artist not as a business man with epic visions. Which is why finally the mysterious Audrey the real writer he is supposed to consult who always helps Mayhew's stories out of a jam becomes the catalyst for this story as well by initiating the sexhorrordetective story as soon as she is asked to. Normal writers apparently are like either Fink or Mayhew but she sees through to what makes for realworld successful writing not some dorky contrived common man story and she initiates the final actionfilled finale immediately. This is PURE GENIUS! Adaptation as one user here mentioned is like this film because of the similarity in how the plot loops back in on itself. But this one is much more subtle to the point where the common man would not even understand this movie and thereby fulfill its message that all people want are the action films that Hollywood dishes to us just like the mogul states over and over and we see delivered on the last third of the celluloid. In the end Fink realizes his idealism that what he really wanted is to get his artistic view rejected so that he can maintain his idealistic unrealistic outlook which is his true passion the fight for self fulfillment. This is personified by the appearance of the girl on the beach with Fink still not realizing what would be in the box because he doesn't comprehend Hollywood thinking or action movies or mainstream movies or plots. But he has achieved his goal as has the movie for Joel and Ethan as both being an incredibly wellthought and executed film both an art flick and an action piece with more perfectly executed symbolism than anyone since Wells.Now you know why it won all the Cannes awards that year and why these two brothers from St. Louis Park Minnesota are gods of the art film while the contrasting Warchowski brothers were once gods of the common man film the first Matrix at least. The Warchowski's even named the subtitle of the Matrix Reloaded as The Burly Man which if you look closely zoom in is the name of Barton Fink's mystery screenplay thereby once again fulfilling the intention of this film to the fullest that what common people want is delivered like clockwork in the Matrix just like pure Bible prophecies. Amen brothers.".

It's basically a film about writer's block it was written when the Brothers Coen were struggling with 'Miller's Crossing'in the midst of their own block and how lonely the life of the mind is. But the message here is that a writer must do everything he can not to be isolated from his fellow man. Barton is trying to write a screenplay for the common man but won't even listen when one such common man his neighbor in the Hotel Earl played by John Goodman tries to tell him stories. He's too interested in spouting clichs about the nobility of the art of writing and the great service he is providing in his works. From the above Barton Fink may sound a little dry but it is anything but and as is customary in Joel and Ethan's films the narrative never goes where you think it will.

They have written and produced some great homages to the film noir era of Hollywood and this film is no exception.First is the great dialog written by the brothers. Great dialog is a feature of their films and this one has some of the most memorable I have heard. You can almost turn off the visual and just listen and be enchanted and know you are listening to a Coen brothers film.But turning off the visual would deprive you of the great cinematography of Roger Deakins. His can frame a scene to the point that you could pause the film and just soak in the texture and color and realism. It is almost as if every frame is a painting.The Coen brothers also seem to get the best performances out of an actor that I have seen. John Goodman is brilliant in this film and he seems to do his best work for the Coens. John Turturro is captivating as the hack writer who talks about his love for the common man but just really doesn't know the common man and really doesn't care about them. Michael Lerner was brilliant as the requisite man behind the desk that is the feature of 40's noir.One doesn't always know what is in the Coen brothers minds. Is this a foretelling of the rise of Nazism of intellectuals who really didn't understand the appeal of fascism to the common man or a surreal portrait of someone who sells out. No matter what their intention they make you think and return to see their films again and again.".

	schema:reviewBody "This slowpaced journey of a writer being lured into a doomed life in  the limboesqe state of California synonymous with misery takes it time developing and preparing itself for a dynamic execution in the end.  John Turturro is brilliantly subdued as the tragic writer. Most of the most powerful emotions he conveys are not done through any words or even  give away facial expression. He finds a way to make all those emotions  implied so that you the viewer almost insert your own feelings of anguish and impotence into his role. Michael Lerner earned an Oscar nomination as  an enthusiastic director who is critically selfdetermined though  constantly shifting on what he is supposed to be determined about. John Mahoney  Judy Davis and Tony Shaloub also turn in solid dependable performances. But above all the other actors it is John Goodman who shines in a  brilliantly conceived and brilliantly executed role. While I will not give away the secret behind his character this is not a performance that any true  film buff will want to miss. It is one of the most dynamic and powerful performance in recent memory. And so you will not want to miss this  the Coen brothers most moody and tightest film even beyond their other masterpiece Fargo.".

He wants to create a new living breathing theater of and about the common man. He has one hit play and then shuffles off to Hollywood to continue his fight for artistic purity. The second he gets there Hollywood has different plans. They want him to get cracking on a wrestling picture. People are going to say to you Wallace Beery wrestling it's a Bpicture. Fink slowly realizes he's in over his head in a low genre. Thankfully his neighbor John Goodman shows up to help Fink connect to the mind of the common man. Fink can't hear him because he's too busy listening to himself talk about nothing.There are a couple of different movies going on in Barton Fink. My favorite one and the most funny is the story of pretentious Fink and the harsh reality check he gets from the Hollywood players. Jack Lipnick Michael Lerner is hilarious. He's the studio head who talks a mile a minute. He confounds Barton with his West Coast ways. He has showmanship and Barton has none. Fink also runs into another fast talking studio exec Ben Geisler Tony Shalhoub. All the scenes with Lerner and Shalhoub are classic. I've watched this movie many times just to see those scenes. The fast forward button took me to the scenes I needed.The rest of Barton Fink is an odd tale. There is murder Goodman cops writers block and visions of Hell.  Fink came out to L.A. to show us something beautiful but got knocked to his knees as Hollywood showed him the way things really are Their way or no way.  A surreal cautionary tale about Hollywood although it makes me want to meet some slick guys like Lipnick and Geisler. I would laugh my head off as they tell me how idiotic I am. We don't put Wally Beery in a fruity movie about suffering! I thought we were together on that!!".

Above all there is the indelible turn of Judy Davis  in a field of broad brush eccentrics she embraces the general breadth of character whilst arresting the camera as the still point on which the worm turns. Impressive.I couldn't help myself thinking about Adaptation I'm afraid. It's not the same film by any means. What Charlie Kaufmann achieves is a coherence that has you chuckling and shaking your head as you leave the theatre. The chaos and unravelling of Barton Fink is not only the manner but also the content of the Coens' movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Barton Fink John Turturro is a New York playwright who gets a job working for Hollywood in 1941. When he meets his boss Jack Lipnick Michael Lerner Barton is assigned a wrestling movie. Barton takes residence in the dilapidated Hotel Earle and sets to work but gets severe writer's block from the start. He meets his neighbor Charlie Meadows John Goodman an outwardly friendly man but who may or may not be a serial killer. Barton also meets novelist WP Mayhew John Mahoney and his mistress Audrey Taylor Judy Davis who struggles to put up with Mayhew's constant drinking. When Audrey is unexpectedly killed while visiting Barton Charlie recommends that they keep it quiet from the police. Soon Barton completes the screenplay but Lipnick chastises him for it. The acting is great all around. Turturro is fantastic as Barton and Goodman fits the character of the jovial yet sinister Charlie perfectly. It's really hard to imagine anyone else in the role. Barton Fink is one of those movies where you really have to pay attention in order to know what's going on. We follow Barton through his week at Hollywood as he tries to write but witnesses all these strange occurrences while there. All the strange and bizarre parts of the movie add to the existential and surreal tone of the film. Although definitely a comedy Barton Fink could probable also be considered a horror film. Not something like Dracula or Frankenstein where it's clear but more like Eraserhead where the tone builds on the creepy atmosphere. And it's done in only a way that the Coen brothers could do it. An atmospheric nightmare that can make you laugh. If you like the Coen brothers watch Barton Fink if you haven't already.".

Reluctantly he agrees but when he is assigned a wrestling picture he finds he is completely blocked up. With a deadline looming can he come up with a good story ?This movie which won the Palme D'Or at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival seems to be saying that fruity movies designed for critics are worthless. Isn't that a delicious irony ? An arty movie reflecting on the selfindulgent egotistical uninvolving qualities of arty movies. Barton is so selfobsessed with the importance of his work he completely misses the point of everything that's happening around him. Only at the very end when Lipnick finally chews him out does he begin to understand the point of writing and cinema and it's not to win acclaim for yourself. What makes this especially weird is that for the Coen Brothers this critical darling of a movie was sandwiched between two even better films Miller's Crossing and The Hudsucker Proxy two fantastic entertainment extravaganzas both of which were mauled and bombed. It's a beautiful film though filled to the brim with subtext which invites interpretation  the Hotel Earle is really Hell and Charlie is the Devil is it Audrey's head in the box wrestling as a metaphor for Barton's block beauty as a distraction from workreality Mayhew as King Nebuchadnezzar unable to interpret his own dreams Barton's surreal experiences of Hollywood. There as so many engaging little nods to these ideas like the hotel stationery logo A day or a lifetime ! or the odd whooshing noises whenever a door is opened Skip Lievsay's sound design is terrific. Of course some characters can be interpreted as disguised parodies with Barton as Clifford Odets Mayhew as William Faulkner and Lerner as Louis B. Mayer but this is hardly a biopic or expos story. The cast are all terrific with Turturro giving a careerbest turn Goodman doing an incredible job with a character who seems to transform constantly throughout the film Davis as a southern belle straight out of Tennessee Williams Lerner and Shaloub injecting wry doses of humour and Mahoney in a showstopping drunk role. The ace photography the Coens first with cameraman Roger Deakins is simply stunning throughout long elegant takes amazing ultracloseups as we literally crawl into Barton's Underwood typewriter a bravura downtheplughole tracking shot. Combine this with Carter Burwell's typically spare haunting score and terrific production design by Dennis Gassner  the Earle is a much a character as any of the actual people  and the result is an unforgettable piece of fantasy drama and one of the Coen's best movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS!For me the clue to understanding this film was the line I will show you the life of the mind and I feel that is just what this movie is about. It's about the creative process of writing. It shows how the mind of an artist works. In the beginning there is Barton Fink who has just finished his first play with raving reviews and now is under the pressure of following up to that. It's about the insecurities he feels as a writer. Will he write something the audience wants or what is in his heart? Is there anymore ideas left in him or was the play his only one? It feels like the ideas are right in front of him under the surface but he just can't see them. the peeling wallpaper and Charlie as a common man who is much more than he seems to be. Bill Mayhew again is an artist who has turned into the business of writing screenplays that Hollywood wants and it has destroyed him and his inspiration the drinking and the fact her secretary writes his stuff for him. He might be there to show what Barton fears would happen to him or just to show the pitfall of an artist who gives up to the demands of the large audience Hollywood executives. The turning point is when Barton must get something concrete for the meeting in the morning and calls Audrey. The scene with her in the bedroom is to show the inner struggle of him as a writer. Will he follow the path of Mayhew and give up on his ideals? Will he satisfy in writing something mediocre or will he follow his heart?The murder of Audrey is then highly symbolic. After she's dead Barton goes into the meeting and after struggling decides not to tell the executive anything because he doesn't want to follow Audrey's advice. Along with her died the option he had in his mind about writing the clichd screenplay with action and a love story. Now the pressure of writing about what people want has gone and only through that can the real creative process start. Finally he can concentrate on writing.The fact that Charlie was the killer might be just that he was another part of Bartons mind. He was the courage Barton needed to kill Audrey and Mayhew his inner fears and get on with his work. I think Charlie needed to be Crazy Mundt just to show that every common man is more than he seems and there really isn't even such a thing as a common man. Everyone has an interesting story in them when you just know how to look. In fact in the beginning Charlie says many times I have stories but Barton is too caught up in his inner struggles to listen Charlie says this in the end You didn't listen.Not really sure still about the burning of the hotel and the killing of the detectives. Maybe it was all just a manifestation of all that action and bursting in Bartons mind now that he finally got the flame of inspiration.In the end his script is turned down but he knows he has given it all he had. He finally reaches the beach he's been looking at in the picture. He's found his fulfillment in making the right choice creatively. You can't write thinking about what people will want to see you have to write about what's in your heart. That is what creating is all about. That is what gives your mind peace. So basically for me this movie is just about the life of the mind of an artist. What goes on there during the creative process. All the insecurities pressures and pretentiousness that you must conquer to get into that place in your soul where true art comes out from. And finally there is still the fear of what the common man wants. You want to write for him but does he only want mediocre entertainment without anything deeper? Maybe the box is just to resemble how you need to shut all that out of your mind and hide it to overcome your block.Of course that ain't a perfect interpretation and there is so much more and so many different levels in this story. That is what I feel makes it such a great movie. Something you can watch multiple times and always find something new.".

However the two adulterous lovers Jamie Getz and Frances McDormand do not plan to assassinate the betrayed husband Dan Hedaya. On the contrary he hires a sleazy PI M. Emmett Walsh to spy on them to carry out some twisted plan of his own. That is until the investigator goes rogue and the situation escalates in the most grotesque of ways.This escalation is matched by the Coens' constant shifts between genres achieved through lighting music and camera movements. Noir straightforward thriller horror black comedy Blood Simple is each of these and all of them at once but the transition is never forced or unnatural in fact these transitions occur because somehow the story itself demands that they happen. In a way this is a film that is aware of its own fictitious nature and toys with it as much as possible  because it can. This has since become a trademark of the two brothers and it is as fresh and original now as it was back in 1984.The same can be said of the four main actors Getz and McDormand soon to be Mrs. Joel Coen form a solid leading couple thoroughly menaced by the sudden ferocity of Hedaya then best known for playing Rhea Perlman's dimwitted exhusband on Cheers an image he gladly and expertly reverses here. And then there's Walsh who takes his practically identical role in Blade Runner and increases the character's unlikability turning in one of the most brutally charming villainous performances of the '80s and of the Coen canon.Joel and Ethan Coen had a very clear idea of what they wanted to achieve in the movie business from the getgo and Blood Simple is one of the best examples of this for 90 minutes it takes you to a whole new world one that most people are happy to revisit as often as they can.".

	schema:headline " First outing for the Coens is an outstanding 80's film noir thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the Coen brothers' directorial film debut and not only is it different from most other films in the Coens' catalog of work it is just a different kind of film altogether. With a budget of just a little more than one million dollars and four main characters the Coen brothers created a film noir thriller 35 years after the genre had expired. In this film the Coens demonstrate that if you have a conscience a killing can be hard to carry out but regardless of whether or not you have a conscience a killing is hard to get away with.Throughout the film as is true in many film noirs the audience is kept aware of most of what is really going on which is a grand misunderstanding with very tragic consequences. The four characters are all being misled by the incomplete part of the jigsaw puzzle that each of them possesses. The setup is simple enough Ray is having an affair with Abby wife of his evil boss Marty. Marty gets angry about the situation and decides to pay a private eye to murder both of them. Things proceed to go as badly as possible for everyone from that point on as each of our characters are mainly motivated by mistrust  even the young lovers Ray and Abby.What makes Blood Simple different from other Coen brothers films is he complete lack of humor throughout the entire film. Even the bleak Fargo is sprinkled with humor throughout. Equally noticeable is the cold remoteness that fills every square inch of this film which includes everything from Abby's Texassized apartment to the flat open stretches of Texas landscape. This cold remoteness just seems to magnify the quiet terror of what is going on. For in this movie the spilling of blood isn't clean easy or free of emotional consequence. For example when one character is in the process of burying the body of someone he believed had been murdered by someone else he finds out much to his surprise that the person is actually still alive. Now faced with the necessity of killing this person to cover up the crime he finds the task impossible to do in a clean quick way  with a rifle. As a result he winds up actually killing the person in the most horrible way possible  by simply ignoring the fact that he is still alive and burying him anyway  all because he is too queasy to commit the overt act of shooting someone himself. As we witness the sun come up on a day bereft of the life of the deceased and the entombment complete it's very relieving to remember it's only a movie.None of this is to say that Blood Simple isn't an enjoyable film. Seeing the characters and their lives come apart one by one will keep you riveted to your seat. We already know who done it we're just hanging around to see if the other characters figure out not only who done it but what it is that has been done in the first place. All the cast members were great and Frances McDormand Dan Hedaya and M. Emmett Walsh have gone on to bigger and better things since this movie was made. I just wonder what happened to John Getz since he performed just as well as the other three only to remain largely unknown. With the exception of a small part in the remake of The Fly in 1986 I can't think of another film in which I've seen him.In summary the best thing about Blood Simple is that even if we always know what's happening we never know what's going to happen next up to the very end. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first offerings of most filmmakers provide an interesting indication of the directions in which their future output is likely to develop. Blood Simple on the other hand is an example of a fully realised entity which contains so many of the qualities and stylistic touches which are now synonymous with the Coen Brothers' entire body of work that it's evident just how clear a vision they had of what they wanted to achieve right from the very start. For their debut they brought to the screen a stereotypical film noir which contained familiar ingredients and themes such as murder betrayal corruption deceit double crosses and plot twists and added black humour gruesome violence and some compellingly eccentric characters.The movie has a strong visual style which is produced by clever use of light shadows and colour and also a variety of typical film noir camera angles. The disconcerting mood which this creates is also further enhanced by the predominantly laconic interactions between the characters and the fact that everyone in the movie is distrustful of everyone else. The screenplay is excellent and the amount of suspense and intrigue generated makes the story intense and very engaging throughout.Texas bar owner Julian Marty Dan Hedaya harbours suspicions about his wife Abby Frances McDormand and hires seedy private detective Loren Visser M.EmmetWalsh to follow her. When Visser's investigations reveal that Abby is having an affair with one of Marty's employees a barman called Ray John Getz Marty responds by offering Visser 10000 to kill the couple. The private detective subsequently doctors a photograph he'd taken of Abby and Ray together to give the appearance that they'd been killed and meets with Marty to collect his money. Marty accepts the photograph as authentic and duly pays Visser his fee. When the transaction is complete Visser promptly shoots Marty in the chest and leaves the gun which belongs to Abby close by.The circumstances of Marty's murder lead to a sequence of misunderstandings and complications. Initially when Ray arrives at the crime scene and sees Abby's gun he quickly deduces that she must've killed her husband and so he tries to cover up her crime. He moves the body which he intends to bury into his car and drives down a highway but discovers that Marty who had appeared to be dead is still living. Ray goes ahead anyway and buries Marty alive.Later when Ray tells Abby what he's done to protect her and she doesn't understand he assumes that she's being deceitful and this impression is reinforced sometime afterwards when she takes a silent telephone call which he assumes is from another lover. When Abby goes to the bar to check on what Ray has told her she gets the impression that he must've gone to see Marty and got involved in a fight over the amount of wages which were due to him.More serious trouble for the couple develops however when Visser realises that he's left a clue to his guilt at Marty's bar and sets about tying up all the loose ends. This involves the planned elimination of Abby and Ray and eventually brings the action to its gripping and very original climax.Ray's an extremely familiar type of noir character as he's an ordinary guy who's unwittingly drawn into a situation which he doesn't understand where events go increasingly out of control and where he isn't able to do anything to prevent matters from getting even worse. John Getz is suitably unpretentious in this role and conveys his character's bewilderment and growing sense of anxiety with great skill. Frances McDormand is also wonderfully understated as the adulterous Abby who's similarly baffled by what happens and frequently misunderstands what's going on.Julian Marty is emotionally wounded bitter and jealous and his powerful need for revenge drives him to seek the most violent and permanent solution possible. This is rather ironic considering his evident distaste for the course of action he's chosen and also the fact that he becomes physically sick on seeing Visser's photographs. Dan Hedaya portrays Marty's complex mixture of emotions very convincingly in a performance which contributes strongly to the success of the film.The stand out performance of the movie is provided by M.EmmetWalsh who as the sly sweaty and totally unscrupulous private detective exudes a brand of wickedness which conveys forcibly the thoroughly despicable nature of his character. His complete lack of morality also makes him very comfortable in his own skin and this quality together with his often jovial demeanour make him particularly disturbing and fascinating. EmmetWalsh's ability to capture the whole range of this villain's characteristics is extremely impressive and compelling.Considering its low budget and the Coen Brothers' lack of experience at the time when the film was made Blood Simple is an extremely enjoyable and good quality movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "The first offerings of most filmmakers provide an interesting indication of the directions in which their future output is likely to develop. Blood Simple on the other hand is an example of a fully realised entity which contains so many of the qualities and stylistic touches which are now synonymous with the Coen Brothers' entire body of work that it's evident just how clear a vision they had of what they wanted to achieve right from the very start. For their debut they brought to the screen a stereotypical film noir which contained familiar ingredients and themes such as murder betrayal corruption deceit double crosses and plot twists and added black humour gruesome violence and some compellingly eccentric characters.The movie has a strong visual style which is produced by clever use of light shadows and colour and also a variety of typical film noir camera angles. The disconcerting mood which this creates is also further enhanced by the predominantly laconic interactions between the characters and the fact that everyone in the movie is distrustful of everyone else. The screenplay is excellent and the amount of suspense and intrigue generated makes the story intense and very engaging throughout.Texas bar owner Julian Marty Dan Hedaya harbours suspicions about his wife Abby Frances McDormand and hires seedy private detective Loren Visser M.EmmetWalsh to follow her. When Visser's investigations reveal that Abby is having an affair with one of Marty's employees a barman called Ray John Getz Marty responds by offering Visser 10000 to kill the couple. The private detective subsequently doctors a photograph he'd taken of Abby and Ray together to give the appearance that they'd been killed and meets with Marty to collect his money. Marty accepts the photograph as authentic and duly pays Visser his fee.

	schema:reviewBody "Abby is cheating on husband Marty with his employee Ray. Unbeknownst to them Marty has had the pair followed and caught in the act by an odious private detective. With Marty rejected he turns to the detective with an offer of money to kill the cheating lovers and dispose of the bodies. The detective accepts and with Marty out of town to ensure an alibi the plan seems so clear and simple to execute. However where blood is involved nothing ever runs smoothly or simple.Watching No Country for Old Men recently put me in mind of Blood Simple and gave me an excuse to watch it again for the first time in about a decade. I was glad that I did because although it is very slimmed down all the themes and standards that continue with the Cohen brothers down the years. The film is a modern noirish crime thriller with a contained set of circumstances bringing death and ruin to all involved. The story is engaging but it does have holes within it but they are not serious enough to affect the flow. What carries it through everything though is the visual style and feel given to the film by the Cohen's. From the opening sequence in the car to the ever present roar of the incinerator to the sweating cackling presence of the detective the sparse dialogue just doesn't matter because of the delivery. As with No Country you can feel the oppressive heat and tension in each scene and it makes for a satisfying film.The cast play to this heat and tension with contained but tense performances. The standout is Walsh whose sweaty moral void is the heart of the film. Hedaya is almost as good in a smaller role. The two lead characters suffer a little from being less interesting but nevertheless both Getz and McDormand are good. Blood Simple is a tight and short film with limited dialogue and little in the way of quick action. However what it does have is a wonderful sense of Texas and crime. The slow pace adds to the claustrophobic feel of heat which in turns adds to the tension and the constant presence of death in the air. Amazing to think the Cohen brothers started getting it so right so early in their careers.".

If you like passive viewing this isn't for you. When you kvetch about B.S. all it does is indicate you were a latecomer to the Coens and saw them in nonchronological order after seeing Fargo.

It's not about the perfs it's about the thought you as a viewer bring to it. This is a postMethod movie and it's extremely clever and deep.Plot too intricate? It's less complex than it appears and much easier to understand than some piece of convoluted tripe like Mission Impossible. SPOILER The doublecross begins in midconversation in M. Emmett Walsh's VW bug.For me the pacing is perfect. Any ten minutes of this movie is more thoughtful than plenty of other movies with frantic activity trying to hide their facile nature Minority Report O Brother etc. etc. ad nauseum. And I do not enjoy any of the fussy formulaic followups the Coens made after this. The joy of this movie is watching characters 'complete the picture' incorrectly and then take action in a way that will be painfully consistent with their assumptions. The movie paints the world as a chilly machine with parts set in motion by human idiocy and implicates a God indifferent to all manner of human suffering. All of which should sound familiar to anyone who's read Mark Twain's The Mysterious Stranger.The spare conceits of this movie are perfectly scaled. It has a minimalist score with some very nice music cues and three or four sweet camera tricks so quietly inserted that you might miss them which make me smile.".

Hedaya discovers the tryst through the services of the fat wheezing repulsive but compliant private eye M. Emmet Walsh.Hedaya confronts McDormand in her house of adultery and tries to drag her out to his car. McDormand is a tough babe though. She bites his index finger spins around and kicks him firmly in the jewels. This comes close to being a clich in scenes in which strong women are attacked by brutal men and the scripts ordinarily call for the man to groan and clutch his groin for a moment before springing back to the attack. Not here. Hedaya is positively disabled falls to his knees in pain struggles back to his feet stumbles towards his car down on his knees again and vomits.That little scene in which most of our expectations are violated is emblematic of the whole film. Nothing goes quite the way it was planned or the way we expect it to. A body that has been shot and remained motionless for hours in a pool of blood comes back to life unexpectedly. But not the way it's usually done for shock value as in so many slasher movies.At any rate Hedaya rehired Walsh to kill the pair of sinners and dispose of their bodies. Instead Walsh doublecrosses Hedaya and shoots him with McDormand's little revolver leaving the weapon behind as a frame. Goetz discovers the body and the gun and believing that McDormand was the shooter disposes of Hedaya's halfdead body by burying it alive. I'll skip the ending.The Coen brothers have found themselves an honest and original style. And it IS original because it flies in the face of modern trends towards loud musical scores instantaneous editing wobbling cameras shock cuts lots of gutsy physicality and a general sense of chaos. The pace is leisurely. Attention is paid to details sometimes relevant a forgotten cigarette lighter sometimes not the brass object on which a cigarette is stubbed out. But all add to the overall ambiance with an effect similar to Hitchcock's but done quite differently. The art director should get a prize but so should many other elements  photography and lighting in particular. What I'm trying to get across is the notion that this  and the Coen's subsequent films  seems made for an adult audience rather than a horde of popcorneating energydrinkimbibing post adolescents. THAT audience will sit aghast during the climactic violence and wonder why they don't see any exploding squibs and why the accompanying score consists only of a muffled Mexican song from next door rather than some electronic neuronnumbing percussive assault.Since 1984 the Coens have had some ups and some downs. The ups include the nearmasterpiece Fargo. None of them have been less than interesting. They're a modest shambling sort of team the Coens and judging from the way they look today they must have been about nine years old when they made Blood Simple. They're among the most individualistic and innovative writers and directors working today.See it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Blood Simple is directed written and produced by Joel and Ethan Coen. It stars John Getz Frances McDormand Dan Hedaya M. Emmet Walsh and SammArt Williams. Music is scored by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Barry Sonnenfeld.Suspecting his wife of having an affair with one of his bartenders Texas bar owner Julian Marty Hedaya hires sleazy Private Investigator Loren Visser Walsh to find the proof. When that proof comes a deal is struck to have the unfaithful couple killed but this is merely the start of a sequence of events that prove that when blood is shed unlawfully things are never simple.The Coen brothers announced themselves to the cinematic world in 1984 with this deadly neonoir of some narrative substance that's in turn resplendent with technical smarts. Taking their cue from the edgy film noirs of yesteryear the Coen's wrap their own original bent for off kilter cinema around the vagaries of the human condition. The story always remains interesting throughout continually keeping the viewer on their toes managing to remain easy to understand logical and this in spite of some required convolution. Humid atmospherics are drip fed into the production pulsing ceiling fans seedy motel rooms barely lighted highways and faces half bathed in shadow Sonnenfeld's photography belying the low budget afforded production.The characters themselves are soon submerged in a world of misunderstandings double crosses and murder this as Carter Burwell lays a score over it that blends a slow piano death rattle with low base throbbing invoking images of some down on his luck gangster from the 30s lamenting on a bar stool in some back street Speakeasy. Cast are uniformly excellent but Walsh just about steals it with sleaze greed and cold blood running through Visser's veins. The brothers Coen show some of what would become their trademark body bag humour while some scenes have a disgustingly cruel gleeful edge to them. Script is as tight as a duck's bottom with dialogue often sardonic and the final 15 minutes of film practically dialogue free is a masterpiece of tension building.Quite a debut indeed.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS EVERYWHERE . . .I gave this movie a 3 because unlike some other flicks by these guys I didn't find the movie unwatchable  I just found it incredibly dull.In about 20 or 30 years a new generation of movie watchers will pick up this movie and others from the Brothers and will wonder geez out parents must have been completely insane.Like when you look back at original Dragnet episodes and you practically pee yourself they're so stupid. But back in the 50s they were considered spectacular.This move was terrible. There seems to be a contingent of people out there who see a movie like this and find artsy reasons to like it. They like the camera angles the cinematography the noir and other words that have nothing to do with the story itself.If that's your idea of a great film then you might love this film.My idea of a great film is  a great story told well.This story was silly. The story was ironically simple. Too simple. While the writers seemed to have strained to make the story intricate it was about as intricate as a Scooby Doo episode.Here is the story in about 5 sentences  Bar owner's wife sleeps with Bar owner's bartender. Bar owner attempts to hire local hick to kill bartender and wife. Hick only pretends to kill bartender and wife and then after collecting the money kills bar owner. Bartender finds body of bar owner and thinks wife did it and so bartender tries to hide the bar owner's body. Unfortunately the Bar owner is not dead so bartender buries him alive. Hick comes back to try to kill bartender and wife to recover evidence linking himself to bar owner's murder but instead only kills bartender  wife survives. The End. Thank you  I saved you a few bucks and a few hours.The bar owner is Carla's husband from Cheers  a HORRIBLE actor and not convincing as the burned husband. The bartender is not interesting. The wife who was great in Fargo was soso. The Texas hick played the part fine it just was not interesting.In sum I was not surprised or impressed by any part of the movie. The plot was silly and impossible the characters were boring and behaved irrationally from start to finish and the murders were stupid and uninteresting.Further there is only about a gallon of blood in the human body. The bar owner lost about 15 gallons of blood in the horribly slow 40 minutes that he was dying and then being buried alive.Further bartender buries bar owner in the middle of a plowed farm field. They keep showing a shot from a helicopter of the car in the middle of the dirt field. This must have been one of the great artsy moments that I didn't appreciate. What I did appreciate was how ridiculously asinine it would be for a criminal to drive two tire tracks to the middle of a plowed field bury a body and then drive away with a farm house a few hundred yards away. I mean how long would it be before the farmer got curious and followed the tracks to the place where there's a bunch of footprints and a 6' hand dug area? I mean DUH? That right there is stupid as all get out. People bury bodies in the woods for a reason.This movie was too dumb to be interesting. The story was simple the acting so so and the artsy stuff that so many people seem to thing made this movie something more than a borderline Bmovie murder nonmystery  it evades me completely  I guess I must just not be artsy enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Cohen brothers did a marvellous job in delivering a suspenseful film noir in which a tavern owner named Julian Marty Dan Hedaya is betrayed by his wife Abby Frances McDormand who is having an extra marital affair with one of Julian's tavern employee's named Ray John Getz. Julian wants to confirm his suspicions so he hires an overweight and slimy private detective named Loren Visser M. Emmet Walsh to follow his wife Abby to see if she is in fact involved in a sexual relationship with Ray.Not only does Loren Visser confirm Julian's worst suspicions about his wife Abby's sexual relationship with Ray Loren gleefully provides to Julian some compromising photographs of Abby and Ray that take Julian by surprise and lead to his wanting to confront his wife Abby about her affair. Julian's reaction to seeing those dirty photos sends him over the edge and when his attempt to physically pull Abby out of the arms of her lover Ray fails Julian reluctantly seeks the assistance of the slimy private detective Loren Visser once again. Julian wants Loren Visser to murder his wife Abby and her lover Ray and do away with their bodies where no one will ever find them.The plot thickens and the four main characters in this Cohen brother film noir being Abby Frances McDormand her lover Ray John Getz Abby's revenge filled husband Julian Dan Hedaya and the overweight slimy Private Detective Loren Visser M. Emmett Walsh who Julian hires carry this film from beginning to end with a generous amount of intrigue sprinkled in as well as to whom really betrays whom. This is in my humble opinion an under rated film noir and respecting of more recognition than the over rated 1990 Millers Crossing. I thought Dan Hedaya's portrayal of the tavern owner Julian Marty whose employee barman and wife are having an illicit affair right under his nose and in his attempt to seek revenge results in his own destruction is poignant. The betrayal by all four of the key characters is what makes this Cohen brothers film deserving of belonging in the criterion collection. I give this fast paced film noir a nine 9 out of ten 10 rating. Dan Hedaya was definitely robbed and should have been Oscar nominated for either a Best Actor or at least Best Supporting Actor for his emotional and vengeful portrayal of Julian Marty.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is something about a good crime movie that brings to light the worst and most perverse traits of Mankind that really forces the characters to open themselves to the viewer and show them the complexity of the human mind and spirit the stuff of great drama! 'Blood Simple' was the Coens' outstanding debut as far as I'm concerned it remains their best movie after 'Barton Fink'  their undisputed masterpiece!  and I personally regard it higher than 'Fargo.' It is one of my favourite movies second only to 'Chinatown' I'm constantly watching it. Ironically I originally disliked it the first time I saw it  three years ago?  because I found it very slowpaced which is only a fault in the viewer and never in the movie and boring today I know I was wrong 'Blood Simple' is easily one of the most thrilling and fastpaced movies ever made with a plot that is as simple as it is gripping! This movie is built on the narrative device of 'dramatic irony' which Alfred Hitchcock used a lot in his movies to create and maintain suspense withholding vital information from the characters but allowing the viewer to always know what's going on thus trapping the viewer on his powerlessness to change what he knows is about to happen to characters dear to him. For the whole 90 minutes of 'Blood Simple' only the viewer ever has the whole picture in his mind the characters they have small fragments of a disjointed mystery puzzle that leaves clueless in their own personal worlds unable to trust anyone. This lack of harmony results in all sorts of misunderstandings and situations that will eventually result in tragedy for the four main characters.On the surface the movie is very simple Julian Marty impeccably played by Dan Hedaya hires private investigator Loren Visser Emmet Waslh gives the finest performance in the movie as an unlikely and violent villain to find out with his wife Abby the brilliant Frances McDormand in one of her earliest performances is sleeping with and this happens to be Ray John Getz whom I didn't know until this movie but was fascinated with his performance after some interesting incidents Marty pays Visser to kill the couple and this is when 'Blood Simple' becomes a distinctive Coen movie. I mean the first 27 minutes are already brilliant and unique with a rare raw energy to it. But the last 60 minutes are just outstandingly good! The dialogue is acid witty economical the editing is tight it's wonderful how one scene seamlessly transits into another the cinematography built on dimlylit interior sets shadowy spaces neon lights and other artificial light is beautiful and unsettling in the way it creates a dark atmosphere. And the sound with crackling sounds everywhere helps a lot too! In 90 minutes the Coens also breathe life into four distinct characters they're complex bigger than life built on just a few strokes of good lines that immediately define them. Marty is obsessive in the way he stalks his wife domineering and just disgusting in the way he looks at and treats women one has the feeling he's this macho cowboy with his boots open shirt showing his hairy chest and oily hair to whom women are just objects. Ray and Abby are a lovely couple and although she remains this innocent nave character until the end Ray is a tortured man on the inside doing horrible things for love and slowly growing into paranoia and mistrust.But Visser he's the cherry on the top. M. Emmet Walsh just plays this vicious human being to a T! He's completely remorseless amoral lacking whatever values a normal person would behave. He's greedy untrustworthy ruthless cowardly too and will do anything for money  he outdoes Carl's and Gaer's inhumanity in 'Fargo' in many ways he was the Coens' warmup for these two memorable hoods but in many ways he was also a better creation. The way Visser is driven to accomplish his goal and the total callousness of his methods just make him one of the finest villains in modern cinema.For such a short movie 'Blood Simple' is filled with memorable even disturbing scenes. There's so much tension in the air when Ray is burying Marty alive in a desolate field you could cut it with a knife! That's probably the scene that stuck most on my mind when I saw this movie. It gives Ray whole new layer of complexity and it pays off with one of chilliest lines in a movie ever! However nothing tops the last ten minutes of the movie the climax per se the claustrophobic confrontation between Abby and Visser it's just fascinating in the way it's handled. For one thing the Coens show a lot of creativity in a scene that basically takes place inside one single apartment where Abby is locked with Visser the fact she never saw Visser before and the fact she thinks it's Marty all along make it even chillier! If we want to define this movie's premise it could be something like 'mistrust leads to ruin' since it is Abby and Ray's lack of mutual trust that ruins their relationship. 'Blood Simple' is a beautiful movie full of some of the best human horror I have ever seen ambiguous characters doing monstrous things and yet they ring ever so true with real life. It's a bold movie that says a lot about the darkest side of human nature in the middle of a great conflict and it makes for one of the most outstanding dramatic experiences I have ever gone through.".

For a movie that David Ansen of Newsweek calls The most inventive and original thriller in many a moon. it was awfully bland and lackluster. Not a very good or original plot or script and the poor acting and editing was unfortunate. There were a few attempts at artsy and original camera work but they were obvious and too deliberate. It is a run of the mill Bmurdermystery without any mystery. It ends with such a mildly ironic twist that i was left wondering if it was really any twist at all. Now I love the Cohen Bros films because of the fun quirks strong and interesting characters strange and thoughtful stories plot twists and the often masterful nature of the totality of the final product But you will find none of that here. It was the Cohen Bros first movie so perhaps the criticism is a little harsh but i'm not so much concerned with the Cohen bro's feelings as I am with preventing anyone reading this from wasting three of their hard earned dollars.".

I suppose the many admirers of this film like watching all the goo when people are murdered or trapped in gruesome ways. Personally I find it boring.  I'm not even in the least horrified since the plot is so contrived and all I think is Oh yeah another special effect.  I don't know why this film is called film noir there is more noir in a typical episode of Tom and Jerry.".

	schema:headline " An Interesting Story Overshadowed by Sluggish Pacing";
	schema:reviewBody "Blood Simple. follows a man who upon discovering that his wife is cheating on him with one of his employees decides that he wants to get rid of both people. The story itself is very good. It's an interesting revengeish murder story that is presented very differently from how one might expect as are many Coen Brothers' movies. The audience might make a prediction as to how it's going to go then something totally unexpected will happen. Sometimes the movie will focus on something simply for the sake of throwing the audience off which I think was an awesome idea. Despite the amazing story and mostly great presentation this movie is one of the most boring ones I've seen all year. I don't know why it had everything going for it I just couldn't enjoy it as much as I was probably supposed to. I ended up taking a couple breaks even just so I could move around and wake myself up a little more. Nothing else about this movie is particularly exceptional. The acting is fine the camera work is fine the soundtrack is fine. There's nothing else worth mentioning despite the fact that that's exactly what I'm doing right now. Overall Blood Simple. is an unpredictable interesting story that drags it's butt slowly along a bed of nails. Sure there were parts of the movie that did pick up but that was maybe ten minutes of this 95 minute movie. In the end I'd still recommend this movie. It's a story definitely worth seeing and who knows? Maybe you won't find it as boring as I did.".

It's the sort of thing that Frank Miller and Alan Moore were themselves busy doing during this time period taking the aesthetics of classic noir cinema and applying them to pixels on comic book pages.What the Coen's film amounts to is likewise an arrangement of pixels the bits and pieces of noir gathered and then assembled like a jigsaw.

They're postmodern exercises  postmodernism is by definition antirealist content to turn away from the world  not only in style but in irony and distance packed with cutsie winkattheaudience filmreferences.Still on these limited terms the film works well. The Coen's have a masterful command of tone and ambiance bathing their film in menace and supercool suspense sequences. If the film has a stylistic flaw it's Frances McDormand who is a bit too plain for a femme fatale.Incidentally the film ends with It's The Same Old Song a classic song by The Four Tops. In a way this song which the Coens strategically place at the end of their debut film announces the style of filmmaking which they will practise throughout their career. With the Coens it's always the same old song only as The Tops go on to say with a different meaning since you've been gone. The irony is in most cases the meaning of a Coen flick is precisely a nihilistic lack of meaning  ie the universe of noir.810  Worth three viewings.".

	schema:reviewBody "Blood Simple is a very good thriller from the Coen Brothers their first movie and it already shows their craft taking form  the absurd violence punctuated by comical moments the spiralling events that careen out of control the soundtrack the camera techniques... everything's already here and it was only their first effort.This isn't as good as Fargo but it is more of a straight thriller than a mix of genres. It's darker more grimy and more serious Touch of Evil meets Detour. It's got all the elements of classic film noir while maintaining a good level of dark humor that helps elevate the material.The film follows the events in the lives of Abbey Frances McDormand Ray John Getz and Marty Dan Hedaya. Abbey and Marty are unhappily married when Marty finds out his wife has been having an affair with one of his bartenders Ray he hires an unscrupulous detective by the name of Visser played perfectly by M. Emmett Walsh to kill them both.Visser has his own plans and decides to try and take the money for free  Marty dies... or does he? And then Ray gets involved and the title blood simple really comes into play. It is used to describe the aftereffects in the mentality of a person who has just killed. Blood Simple reminds me a bit of Evil Dead which seems apt since the Coens supposedly modeled their film after Sam Raimi's efforts and even made a teaser trailer with Bruce Campbell playing the Marty character. It isn't a horror film but maintains the same dark vibe as Evil Dead and has a ridiculous amount of oozing blood and gore. The grave burial scene is also pretty sickening and something out of an Evil Dead movie.Blood Simple is a really good thriller. As a lowbudget indie flick from the '80s it is very impressive and as the Coens' directorial debut it remains a fascinating example of their skills. It is not in my opinion as perfectly sculpted or humorous as Fargo which is my favorite film of the Coens but it doesn't mean to be  it is a straightforward film noir thriller and in that regard it remains one of the best of all time.".

Though Chaplin played his Tramp character superbly in other movies like Modern Times and The Gold Rush City Lights displays the Tramp at his funniest his bravest his most romantic and his most sympathetic. It's tough for filmmakers in recent days to bring the audience so close emotionally with the characters but it's pulled off. The film centers on three characters the Tramp the quintessential funny homeless man who blends into the crowd but gets caught in predicaments. He helps a drunken businessman Myers a fine performance in his own right from suicide and becomes his on and off again friend that is when it suits him and doesn't notice his 'friend's' state. The other person in the Tramp's life is the Blind Flower Girl Virginia Cherrill one of the most absorbing beautiful and key female performances in silent film who are quite fond of each other despite the lack of total perception. The emotional centerpiece comes in obtaining rent and eye surgery money which leads to a how else can I put it magical boxing match where it's basically a 180 from the brutality and viscerality of a match in say Raging Bull. Though there is no dialog the film achieves a timelessness it's essentially a tale of two loners who find each other lose each other and find each other again the last scene widely discussed by critics for decades is moving if not tearinducing. And it's never ever boring once you get along with the Tramp you find the little things about him the reaction shots the little things he does after the usual big gag look to the ballroom scene for examples of this or when he gets a bottle of wine poured down his pants without the other guy noticing. Truth be told if this film makes you indifferent never watch Chaplin again. But if you give yourself to the film you may find it's one of the most charming from the era or perhaps any era.".

	schema:headline " Chaplin's Masterpiece...and Oh Those Last Five Minutes!";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me join the consensus and call Charlie Chaplin's City Lights a masterpiece. It's only 81 minutes long but they are among the best 81 minutes you could spend at the movies and the last five minutes are simply exquisite. Keep your Kleenex box at arm's length as I doubt if there has been a more honestly heartbreaking scene captured on film. When the formerly blind girl gives the Little Tramp a flower and ultimately says Yes I can see now the scene takes on such emotional gravity as to defy explanation.Chaplin was at his zenith in 1928 when he started a journey of more than two years to develop and film this story and the Little Tramp had already been a familiar character to audiences for over a decade. He had already made the classics The Gold Rush 1925 and The Circus 1928 starring his character so it's obvious he felt a need to take a slightly different direction and deepen the character this time. The advent of talkies didn't stop Chaplin from making this Comedy Romance in Pantomime as he subtitled it as he knew giving the Little Tramp a voice would limit his appeal as a universal character. What I particularly enjoyed in this film is how the Little Tramp fancies himself as a wellmannered gentleman in spite of all the circumstances that bring him down even going to prison for love. It is this selfdelusion and his subsequent mistaken identity as a millionaire that leads him to the blind flower girl played in an effectively plaintive manner by Virginia Cherrill. Her performance is a greatly underrated element in this film as she displays the right amount of vacant innocence to make the last minutes so memorable. Simply compare her to the screen test shown of Georgia Hale Chaplin's leading lady in The Gold Rush and an obviously more experienced actress than Cherrill as Hale struggles to show the right balance between condescension and beatific revelation when she realizes the Little Tramp is the wealthy gentleman who paid for the restoration of her sight.Of course this would not be a Chaplin film without the brilliance of his comedy routines and there is a treasure trove of classic scenes  the rising and lowering of the street elevator the shifting musical chairs scene at the nightclub the mock suicide at the canal and especially the boxing scene which has been imitated by so many lesser filmmakers and was according to the footage included as a DVD extra inspired by an earlier Chaplin short The Champion from 1915. Even a simple moment for example when the Little Tramp mistakes a piece of thread from his vest for a ball of twine is impressive for the sheer delicacy of the moment. And special mention needs to go to Chaplin's musical score where he beautifully interweaves Jos Padilla's La Violetta as his love theme.The transfer to DVD is very good and the 2DVD set has plenty of extras though they vary in quality. The Serge Bromberg documentary provides an informative supplement to the film and the footage of Chaplin from a Vienna press tour is fascinating since it captures the longforgotten worldwide frenzy he created back then. The aforementioned Georgia Hale screen test is a worthwhile addition but runs on a bit too long. The 10minute home movie of Chaplin's trip to Bali has a certain anthropological interest but seems rather pointless otherwise. Regardless the movie itself is rewarding enough and an exquisite jewel that completely justifies Chaplin's reputation as one of the world's leading filmmakers.".

Chaplin does a phenomenal job in his traditional role of the tramp and develops a perfectly convincing romantic relationship with the blind flower girl on the sidewalk.

	schema:reviewBody "City Lights is simply put one of the best movies out there. Every scene is classic and had a huge impact on the history of filmmaking. Chaplin's last 'silent' film tells the story of a poor little man the tramp played by Chaplin who falls in love with a blind flower girl. He becomes friends with a wealthy man who constantly tries to commit suicide. The man only recognizes the tramp character when he is drunk. To impress the flower girl the tramp uses the man's wealth to make her fall in love with him. The only problem is that when the man is sober he doesn't recognize the tramp anymore. On top of this the flower girl has to pay 22 dollars of rent or she will be thrown out of her apartment. Now the tramp desperately seeks for jobs in the city to help his love. Out of this simple plot great comedy and heart breaking moments come forth.The outcome of the movie is to almost all people known. It is regarded as one of the best endings ever taped on film. The movie itself still is masterpiece more than 70 years after it's release. I personally rate this as Chaplin's second best I have seen so far. My favorite remains The Gold Rush. Still this movie gets 55 stars from me.".

	schema:reviewBody "I always thought this was one of Charlie Chaplin's nicest most underappreciated silent movie gems. Then I discovered it really wasn't underrated it's rated very high on most critics' lists. It may be that I usually hear about some of his other movies than I do this one.Part of the reason I think so highly of this is simply that I'm a sentimentalist and story in this film is a very touching one. It's a romance between Charlie's tramp character no name and a blind girl who also had no name in this film. Virginia Cherill who played the blind woman and had a wholesome pretty face which I found very attractive.I'm not always a huge fan of pantomime except for some great comedians of the era like Chaplin Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton but Chaplin was so good at it and this is one of the last of dying breed as talkies were out in full force by 1931. Chaplin was at his best in silent movies anyway and his comedy routines are legendary. He gave me a lot of laughs in this film as always and I particularly laughed I love slapstick at the boxing scene. Kudos too to Harry Myers as the eccentric millionaire.There's a lot of drama as well as humor in this 86minute gem as the Tramp tries to aid a blind girl raising money so she can get an operation to restore her sight.Comedy romance drama with suffering all combine to make this an extraordinary piece of entertainment. It's hard to believe this movie was not up for one single Academy Award.".

	schema:reviewBody "CITY LIGHTS United Artists 1931 written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin 1889 l977 is a silent comedydrama released at the height of the sound era. Distributing a movie in the silent film tradition at the time when silents were considered a fad Chaplin gambled with this production and made it pay off. Although Chaplin hails THE GOLD RUSH 1925 as the one movie he would most want to be remembered CITY LIGHTS nearly dims out his GOLD RUSH and at the same time practically places his other silent masterpiece THE CIRCUS 1928 to oblivion. CITY LIGHTS has stood the test of time balancing perfectly a mixture of comedy and drama but in Chaplin's case pathos.Subtitled A comedy romance in pantomime the story opens in the early morning where the mayor is dedicating a statue to the citizens of the city. After the unveiling the crowd finds a little tramp Charlie Chaplin sleeping on the lap of one of the figures. As he tries to climb down he encounters one problem after another. This opening scene alone is priceless. With such a great beginning Chaplin adds in more comedic insertions blended into the plot. The theme to CITY LIGHTS is remembered mainly about a tramp's love for a blind girl. However there is a subplot involving the tramp's involvement with a millionaire drunk which by far takes up more time than the sentimental love story. These two segments actually set the pattern. First segment set in the afternoon finds Charlie walking down the street examining a nude statue in a shop being annoyed by some newsboys making fun of his tattered clothing. He encounters a beautiful blonde girl Virginia Cherrill selling flowers. After she drops one of her flowers Charlie notices her feeling about the sidewalk for it thus realizing she's blind. Smitten by her beauty he picks it up and pays her for it. Minutes later the slamming of a limousine door is heard with the girl believing the kind gentleman Charlie to be a millionaire. Second segment set at night finds Charlie encountering a drunk Harry Myers trying to commit suicide by drowning himself. Just as Charlie is about to save him he in turn falls into the river. The drunk in gratitude for saving his life takes Charlie under his wing to accompany him to various night clubs until dawn. By morning the millionaire now sober fails to recognize or remember Charlie and orders orders his butler to escort this stranger out of his mansion. This running gag that's repeated in the story might play itself as repetitious but Chaplin manages to breathe new life and funnier routines through his encounters with the drunk and their all night binges. By day Charlie looks after the blind girl and worries when she's not at her usual corner selling flowers. Finding that she's ill and being cared by her grandmother Florence Lee whose behind with her rent and threatened with eviction Charlie offers to help by obtaining and losing various jobs ranging from streetcleaning to fighting in a boxing match. Reading in a newspaper of a European doctor who restores sight for the blind Charlie gives the girl 1000 for an operation the money offered to him by the drunken millionaire who after sober accuses Charlie of robbing him has his arrested and serving jail time. The climatic finish is truly the best thing Chaplin has ever done and certainly one not to be missed.Featured in the supporting cast are Henry Bergman Allan Garcia Albert Austin and Hank Mann. While much has been discussed about Chaplin's performance his costar Virginia Cherrill as the blind girl no name given should not go without mention. Even though her future film career consisted of forgettable programmers and at one time being one of the future wives of film actor Cary Grant her performance is excellent by all means. Although it's been said that future film star Jean Harlow 19111937 appears as an unbilled extra in the night club sequence she is visible in a surviving still photograph but no such scene appears in the finished product. Unlike THE GOLD RUSH CITY LIGHTS had limited showings in revival houses in later years and was never allowed to be distributed to television. Being first introduced to CITY LIGHTS at New York City's revival movie house The Regency Theater formerly located on Broadway and 67th Street in 1979 the memorable thing about this event are the roars of laughter from its theater packed audience. There was one man probably a big fan reliving his childhood memories whose laughter almost drowned out the underscoring of the film. No doubt he was having more fun watching this movie than anyone else. Watching CITY LIGHTS surrounded by an appreciative audience theater is one way to truly appreciate and experience the feel of silent film comedy and to think back as to how the audience reacted in same back in 1931.After Chaplin's death in December of 1977 CITY LIGHTS along with his other silent features were not only resurrected for a new generation to endure but became readily available on video cassette at the time of Chaplin's 100th birthday 1989. In later years CITY LIGHTS was frequently revived on various cable channels ranging from Turner Network Television TNT in the early 1990s American Movie Classics up to 2001 and finally Turner Classic Movies. The complete musical soundtrack that accompanies CITY LIGHTS happens to be the original score composed to perfection by Chaplin himself. Much has been written and said about CITY LIGHTS over the years. To learn more about the making difficulties and long term preparations to CITY LIGHTS either watch Kevin Blownlow's 1980 documentary Hollywood A Celebration of the American Silent Film as narrated by James Mason or Brownlow's other documentaries dedicated entirely to Chaplin's career including outtakes to CITY LIGHTS as well as scenes involving Virginia Cherrill's temporary replacement Georgia Hale Chaplin's costar in THE GOLD RUSH.

Nearly all other films are engineered from prior work. Not so with a small list of projects from Welles Kurosawa Eisenstein ... and this one project of Chaplin's. They are wholly original springing from some nether world.But the other element is the one that impresses the most. This film is about itself about the art of visual narrative. Chaplin was intelligent enough to know that what he was doing was new. The issues are centered on what the audience sees' so while he struggles with what and how the audience sees he builds that into the fabric of the story.The primary framing is about the blind girl who falls in love with him by seeing' him in her own way. Then sees' him at the end in a different way. The rich man recognizes the tramp when drunk but does not when he is not. Nearly all the jokes indeed every element of the film is about this same dynamic the elevator which is not seen but then was the burglars the same the Tramp on the statue on the barrel. Even seeing the cigar before the bum does. Even us seeing the soap and the foreman not.The seeing' is carried over to hearing' with the politician and whistle jokes. And then even further as Charlie turns his back on the new technology of giving us speech and instead shows' us something else he writes and conducts an amazing score instead. This is truly amazing and one reason to take Mike Figgis seriously.No wonder Orson Welles considered this the most important film ever made. But as to the best to watch? Because film is so derivative my own gold standard for the Tramp is Robert Downey's and to some extent Depp's. Comic timing is something that evolves and those men make a more effective Tramp for my modern ability to see.Trivia Chaplin found the blind' girl in a group of spectators at a fight and was struck with how her expressions reflected what she saw. She's pretty as well of course but certainly not the prettiest Chaplin knew. See how Chaplin separately works in both the fight a performance and her reaction to his performance in the film.".

Coming up through the ranks he gradually achieved a godlike stature being awarded total control of every facet of the production.Not only was he often the sole person who knew what the end product was to be as in The Kid but he was also allowed to elaborately improvise in the creative process.  This often meant doing countless scores of retakes over days weeks and even months holding up the cast and crew for days while he brooded over just what to do next and even in the case of The Gold Rush cancelling expensive weeks of location shooting and returning to the studio to start all over again.He cleverly duped chief studio and bank chiefs into somehow going along with his freewheeling and gross inclinations thus mesmerizing their conservative senses into supporting his hitandmiss schemes and trialanderror madness.In other words Chaplin used the entire productional company as merely as his paintbrush with which he toyed at his pleasure to create his personal canvases.  Fortunately he was a genius and at the right place in time to be allowed to get away with such unprecedented extravagence.It was a young and growing industry when Chaplin began emerging and there were no set rules.  People were still trying to figure out just what could be done with the medium  and Chaplin helped to establish its early parameters.He was certainly and autocrat yet that doesn't really matter when it comes to film works.  It's the product that counts.  In the case of City Lights all the bloodsweatandtears that it took to achieve the finished product was more than worth the effort.  Now that all the frustration anger and outrage associated with the behindthescenes unfoldment of this highly troubled production are well in the past what remains is a genuinely moving film classic.Sometimes great enterprises require considerable hardship to forge them into being.  The greater the achievement often the greater the challenge and period of endurance. Whatever the case we are the appreciative recipients of this masterwork which takes its place besides Modern Times and The Gold Rush as one of Chaplin's consummate expressions.".

Whatever the case we are the appreciative recipients of this masterwork which takes its place besides Modern Times and The Gold Rush as one of Chaplin's consummate expressions.";

	schema:reviewBody "The victory of the sound picture over the silent was a speedy and decisive one. The first fulllength talkies were released in 1928. By 1929 theatres were being forced to convert to sound in order to stay in business. By 1930 silent film production by the major studios was completely discontinued and the medium became generally viewed as an anachronism. But in 1931 a new silent picture was released that far from being an embarrassing failure became the fourthhighest grossing picture of the year being even more popular than such classics as the Bela Lugosi Dracula and The Public Enemy. The picture was City Lights and its producer writer director editor composer and star was Mr Charlie Chaplin.Chaplin was of course primarily a comedian and his humour was of broad appeal but audiences of the time were not exactly starved of easy comedy. The Marx Brothers were making great strides on the verbal quipping front and the everpopular Laurel and Hardy had made a successful transition to sound. What makes Charlie stand out and what gave him a level of accessibility that allowed him to continue with his slapstick antics well into the sound era is his equal devotion to story which allowed him a scope for social commentary empathetic characterisation and deep poignancy. Of all Chaplin's silent pictures City Lights is probably his least memorable in the funny stakes. The number of classic gags here is fairly small. Not since The Kid a decade earlier has Chaplin given story so much precedence. City Lights is riddled with coincidence and plot contrivance but it's a tale of such beauty and sincerity that this does not matter. Within this story the comedy becomes functional often serving to puncture a schmaltzy moment before it becomes overdone. Ironically it is the occasional forays into slapstick that help keep City Lights real.As if to snub the talkie City Lights is a remarkable achievement in complex visual narrative even only occasionally relying upon title cards and then often only as an embellishment to the more comedydriven moments. Most plot points and character traits are implied rather than stated which gives the picture a continual smoothness  another thing that would have gone down well with audiences glad to see the back of the intrusive title card. Out of necessity Chaplin's technical approach is more overt than his usual. He often cuts to a closeup to give us a necessary reaction and there are even some whippans in the scene where he and the flower girl first meet but all of this is in keeping with the rhythm and tone of the picture. Those whip pans after all reflect an abrupt emotional moment and are in no way a blatant or showy manoeuvre.But what really makes City Lights work what makes it connect is the man himself on the screen. Those additional closeups once a rarity for a man who acted mainly with his body now show off a capability for intense facial acting. An older more meditative Chaplin may have been keeping the traditions of silent cinema alive but his own career trajectory was entering new ground where emotional expression was increasingly intimate and personal. The result is profoundly moving.".

	schema:reviewBody "City Lights is a different film from what I am used to seeing. I have not watched a Silent film or pantomime in a few years. I really enjoyed the story that Charles Chaplin helped to create and produce for our enjoyment. The plot seems to be commonly used now with a boy falling in love and trying to win the girl's love in return. In City Lights there are a few twists to the plot. The girl is blind and poor the TrampChaplinis poor in love and wants to help the blind girl. The Millionaire can help the tramp out by giving him money but he is an onagain offagain friend depending on whether or not he is drunk.Being that this is a silent film there is more importance on the use of props and the acting of the character. Since in a silent film they can't tell us how they are feeling it is important that we can understand feelings through action. This may be through facial expressions body language dress eye contact kinds of touch or the use of written statements like title cards in a silent film. A prop that stood out to me was the use of flowers. From the flower girl selling her flowers to how Chaplin was always holding or smelling one of the flowers from his special girl the use of flowers helped show the emotions and feelings of the two characters. It symbolized the affection he had for her because like the flowers she couldn't see she couldn't see the true him or his true affections. Another prop that was used was money. From the millionaire's point of view money was really of no matter. He threw a party just because he had been reunited with his friend he went out to the dance club and when Chaplin needed money in order to help the flower girl pay for rent and surgery he was willing to give him one thousand dollars. To the millionaire this money is nothing but to Chaplin and the flower girl this is a showing forth of love and charity. When the movie was made in the 1930s many people were poor and hopeless but the portrayal of Chaplin as a poor but happy and hopeful man might have given hope to others who watched this movie during the Depression. In the film I noticed the use of a repetition or rather a parallelism as was read in the Film Art book dealing with The Wizard of Oz. They show shots one way in Kansas and then reverse the shot in Oz as I saw in City Lights. In City Lights parallelism is done with sight not necessarily with eyes but with the mind. We see the reverse where the poor blind girl sees Chaplin as a millionaire and then at the end she sees him as the tramp he is with her new eyesight. The true reverse is emphasized because she is now working in a shop and making money. The two characters are somehow always at perceived opposite ends of the social class spectrum yet he still has a desire for her to be happy because of his love. Another reverse is the happy friendly drunk millionaire who sees Chaplin as his friend and hero for stopping him from committing suicide. However when he is sober he wants nothing to do with him throws him out and even has him arrested.In a way this film is different then what our generation might be used to but by watching these classics we can better learn where the movies we love today came from and gain a better appreciation for the art of film.".

Undoubtedly we all have a little bit of The Tramp in us.The plot is as follows the Tramp meets and falls in love with a blind girl who sells flowers on the street. She is poor and by a mere coincidence believes that The Tramp is rich. He also saves a drunken millionaire from suicide and despite his gratefulness doesn't remember the poor tramp unless he is drunk.City Lights is no doubt a magnificent feat in motion picture history. It's poignant view of the world and society leaves you laughing and crying at the same time. Some believe this should really be called a drama instead of a comedy. I believe it is a strong mixture of both and a great balance of the two. Both comedic and touching City Lights should not be missed by anyone.".

City Lights is one of those film that you will think you have seen even when you have not. I knew I had never actually seen it but the wonderful opening scene on the statue and the scenario of the blind girl by the side of the road were very familiar to me and I was right into it from the start.

And so he does with some classic sequences across the whole film.The statue scene is memorable for how he makes so much out of so little but the brilliant choreography of the boxing match had me rolling with laughter as it moved so beautifully and imaginatively around the ring. Chaplin is a master and this is just one of many films that shows it as he creates a great little clown that we care about but can also laugh at. His support do no more than that  support him  but yet they are also roundly good. Cherrill provides attractive heart despite her simple character while Myers Garcia Mann and a few others do good physical work alongside Chaplin.City Lights is a really great film that is all the more impressive for still feeling fresh and funny more than seventy years after it was made. The simple narrative is the frame but it is the wonderful and frequent setpieces that tickle and also stick in the mind. So tonight you might be looking at your film queue with lots of modern comedies but it is worth bumping this classic to the top of the list instead.".

The music is also a delightthough my favourite soundtrack in a Chaplin movie is the one for Modern Times with plenty of themes that stuck in my head while the sound effects are wonderfully incorporated and the subtitles easy to understand. The comedy is brilliantly done the scene in the boxing ring is not only one of my favourite scenes in a Chaplin moviealong with the final sequence and the dance of the bread rolls of The Gold Rush the final scene of The Kid and the speech from The Great Dictator but ever in a comedy while there is a very touching love story between the Tramp and the little blind girlplayed touchingly by Virginia Cherrill he falls in love with. And I also found the closeup climax achingly poignant because of its beauty and ambiguity. Chaplin is superb his pantomime skills and physical humour are extremely well judged and he is acts beautifully with Cherrill.Overall yet another Chaplin masterpiece yet for me this is the best of them all. 1010 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Charlie Chaplin made some extremely funny shorts but of his longer films this is one of the best along with The Gold Rush and Modern Times. Two stories are woven together. One is Charlie's onagain offagain friendship with a wealthy drunk. The guy has a case of multiple personality. When drunk he showers Charlie with friendship and gifts. When he's sober he doesn't recognize Charlie at all.The second story involves a pretty blind flower girl who given certain distances angles and lighting resembles Uma Thurman. Charlie falls for her and accepts a thousand dollars from the drunken rich guy in order to pay for the operation that will refurbish her eyeballs.Charlie is accused of stealing the thousand bucks but when he appeals to the rich guy he's sober and won't support Charlie's story. Charlie manages to get the money to the girl anyway but then is picked up by the police and spends some time in jail. When he emerges from the Crowbar Hotel broke and bitter he bumps into the now sighted girl and she recognizes him by his voice and the feel of his hands. The happy ending.There's sentimentality in the story of course. There often is in Chaplin's later films. But as usual it's somehow tempered. Here it's undercut by irony.When Charlie meets the wealthy toff the guy is about to kill himself because his wife left him. He ties a noose around his neck and a big rock to the other end of the rope. He's about to hurl himself and the rock into the river when Charlie intervenes gives him a pep talk and changes his mind. His spirit revived the rich guy spread his arms to the sky dropping the boulder that falls on Charlie's foot.And when Chaplin meets the blind flower girl she's enthralled by his gentleness. Unseen by her the smitten Charlie tip toes behind her to the nearby water fountain where she fills a pail. Her expression is dreamy and far away as the pail fills. Charlie is sitting on a bench next to the fountain himself enraptured. Then she empties the pail by throwing the water in Charlie's face. Well it's not the blind Mr. Muckle busting all the light bulbs in W. C. Fields' general store but what is? A note. There have been some comic prize fights recorded on film not counting the DempseyTunney debacle but I don't think any are as funny as the one Chaplin has choreographed here.It's hard to imagine the kind of talent that could pull off a story like this in a medium like this. Black and white and silent. Applause please.".

The Tramp eventually meets a suicidal drunk Harry Myers and their friendship leads to what might eventually help the girl he loves.Chaplin made great films before and after CITY LIGHTS but for my money this here is his greatest film as well as one of the greatest films ever made. Not only is it one of the funniest movies ever made but I'd also argue that it's one of the greatest love stories if not the greatest. It really says a lot when a movie can conqueror two genres at one time but CITY LIGHTS is simply one of the greatest movies ever made.I think it says a lot that you get one classic scene after another and there's really not a weak spot to be found here. Being 1931 it took some real guts for Chaplin to deliver a silent film and I think he knew that he had to deliver something special because people had moved onto sound. He certainly delivered something special as this here was easily the funniest film he had made up to this point. The opening sequence with the introduction of The Tramp was priceless and we got one hilarious scene after another from that point. The scenes with the drunk are downright hilarious as is another scene where The Tramp is trying to eat but without much success. The cigar sequence is a masterpiece as is the by the water. In fact the story between The Tramp and the drunk would have made a terrific movie on its own. Just like the stuff with The Tramp and the blind girl would have made a perfect film. What's so special is that you get both stories wrapped up in one and it really delivers.Chaplin played The Tramp countless times but he was never better than he is here. Just check out the timing in countless scenes including the boxing match and you can't help but be impressed with the actor. Myers also deserves a lot of credit as the drunk as his timing has to match that of Chaplin throughout and the two men do a wonderful job together. Then you've got Cherrill who wasn't a professional actor but the director makes her shine throughout.CITY LIGHTS contains one great scene after another and all of the laughs lead up to one of the most powerful endings in film history. There's really not enough great things that can be said about this film as it continues to get better with each passing year.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always loved Chaplin Modern Times has long been one of my favorite films and I enjoyed The Circus The Gold Rush The Great Dictator and Monsieur Verdoux. I can easily see how many people consider City Lights his masterpiece. It's hard to even speak rationally about this movie. It's very layered but also very simple and that's what I think defines a great film.The plot is easy to describe the Little Tramp befriends a blind flower girl who mistakes him for a millionaire. Then he saves a drunken millionaire from suicide and uses his money and car to make the flower girl think he's rich. However the millionaire sobers up and forgets the Tramp the flower girl desperately needs money to pay the rent ultimately after a series of comical attempts to earn money the Tramp receives 1000 from the millionaire which after being mistakenly branded a thief he gives to the flower girl before being sent to prison. He gets out months later the flower girl has had an operation to restore her sight and as he stumbles about outside her new flower shop she gives him a flower recognizes him and the film ends.No complex subplots no dialogue. Just a pure and simple story about a Tramp and his love. Chaplin possesses perhaps the greatest gift for changing the audience emotionally the movie is never blunt or outrageous I laughed out loud several times but it wasn't explosive laughter. And I also very nearly cried at several points. When the Tramp finds he's falling in love with the flower girl he's trying to help that made me cry. It's so touching how the Tramp's weaknesses are his strengths. If Chaplin is a communist then I'm a fellow traveler. The Tramp has nothing to give but his heart and his life. He goes through hell and comes out smiling. Sure filmmakers today could learn a lot from City Lights but so could people today if you are human you can learn from this movie.The movie is called a romance comedy and that's what it is. The Tramp voluntarily undergoes several ordeals for the flower girl but he's also subjected to a number of funny situations the nightclub party that showcases the Roaring '20s how he drunkenly struggles to find a girl to dance with the millionaire's attempt to get back home Am I driving? and of course the classic boxing match. The Tramp is the ultimate underdog he can never win but there is beauty is his failure. He finds happiness in life without going along with society's standards. And he gives us happiness too and a little inspiration.Then of course there is the ending. I love Chaplin's endings. The last title card in Modern Times We'll get along and the final shot of The Circus makes me choke a little just to think about it are both great examples. This ending is overflowing with tenderness. The flower girl loves her mysterious savior and has said before that money isn't her greatest concern. But then the Tramp shows up filthy pathetic and right out of jail. She laughs at him and teases him a little goodnaturedly. He's a little reluctant to come to her he stands back a little. Then she takes his hand and suddenly realizes the truth. She confirms it by feeling his arm and then says You? and he asks if she can see now and she says Yes I can see now. Their expressions convey just enough for the viewer to understand completely without being entirely able to say what they understand. You can read the thoughts in her head and then the camera turns to the Tramp and his face is a heartbroken heartfixed strange sad smile. The screen goes black it says THE END and the music continues with a flourish ending on a bittersweet note. I think the ending lets us know that these are real human beings in front of us not just actors. They have real lives and those lives can be changed for better or for worse. It's absolute pathos. You can't be entirely the same after watching City Lights.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rarely do we see a film so absorbing that offers no humour no romance no suspense in the normal sense little dramatic action and no challenge of controversial values at least not explicitly. The latest Cannes Palm D'Or winner 4 months is just such a one. You will not be entertained in the normal sense. Most will come out feeling depressed. But there is also a sense of elation in being privileged to a piece of art work that deserved to be described as nothing less than brilliant.The plot is simple. In a time span of less than 24 hours the audience witness and experience a chillingly realistic abortion. Without ceremony or preliminaries the camera takes the audience right into a crummy apartment in 1987 Romania occupied by two students where Gabita is packing to spend a few days in a hotel for an abortion while Otilia is helping her. However this is really Otilia's story. In the next little while we see her scrambling when the hotel booking falls through having an argument with her boyfriend who wants her to come to his mother's birthday dinner in the evening and making initial contact with the man who will perform the abortion for her friend Gabita. The rest of the story takes place in the hotel where the abortion is performed and Otilia's boyfriend's place where she spends an hour to attend the birthday dinner.Of the four characters the boyfriend has been designed to be common and unimpressive. The man performing the abortion is no doubt a villain but comes across more as unscrupulously selfserving and utilitarian and rather than outright evil. It is in Gabita that we have an unusual type of villain one that you may end up detesting even more than Anton Chigurh in No country for old men. In Gabita is the description clueless redefined  utmost irresponsibility endless procrastination lying for convenience an illusion of an easywayout. All this doesn't really matter as you start to lose patience with and cares less and less for this character until you see that as a result what Otilia has to go through in unflinching loyalty to her friend refining the word hero a word incidentally that doesn't need any and gender differentiation.In today's Hollywood trend of film shooting editing and cutting that leaves your head spinning and completely empty afterwards the camera work of 4 months is beautifully refreshing. At the start there are some long shots covering physically moving scenes giving you a realistic experience of being right there at the scene rather than watching at a distance. Wisely these are not overused. There are also stationary shots reminiscent of Yasujiro Ozu. One particularly brilliant scene is at the dinner table where Otilia is positioned right at the centre of the frame with her boyfriend and his parents beside her as if you are one of the dinner guests looking across the dinner table. For full ten minutes the camera is completely stationary as the animated conversion goes on around her and is sometimes directed at her eliciting brief polite responses. With model minimalism Anamaria Marinca conveys pitchperfect Otilia's uneasiness in this lessthandesirable company her growing anxiety thinking about her friend left alone in the hotel room waiting for the abortion device implanted by the doctor to take effect the surfacing frustration with her relationship with her boyfriend and a whole range of layers of emotions  full ten minutes at the dead centre of an uncompromising camera. Just for these ten minutes she should win an Oscar.4 month does not have any background music same as No country for old men and the life drama plays out naturally without any dramatization. Yet the palpable underlying tension makes you hold your breath. I don't recall a 90 full cinema ever being so quiet particularly when there are long moments of complete silence on the screen when you can hear a pin drop. The audience is so captivated that they hardly breath.4 months does not preach. It is not a morality debate about abortion. What it shows mercilessly to the audience including the image of a jettisoned fetus at 4 months 3 weeks and 2 days the brutal reality two young women faced in totalitarian Romania in the 1980s in trying to get an illegal abortion as well as in daily life. One of the most deserved Cannes' winners in recent years.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chritian Mungiu delivers one of the finer suspense films in the past few years. Set in Ceausescu's grim murderous police state I was reminded of Polanski's shocker Repulsion albeit without the Gothic thrills. It's a loaded subject matter of abortion that sets the scene but we aren't asked to take sides in someones polemic. The nightmare that unfolds is probably played out often and that's the movie's genius. We identify quickly with the dilemma even though the bureaucratic maze the characters have to bribe and finagle there way through is in extreme.The smallest details are accurate and riveting from the possibly dire consequences of not paying a bus fare to eavesdropping on a conversation between a mother and her son that's suddenly interrupted by the sound of gun shot the protagonist here and what a courageous beauty she turns out to be has nerves of steel that any action hero would envy.It's our loss that this may be the only time we get to see Anamarie Marinca perform. She's nearly in every shot in the film and her unsteady conviction to her friend who is seeking an abortion is mesmerizing to watch. Her foil Laura Vasiliu is maddeningly dense and just as effective as the girl who's so lost in her dilemma that you can't tell if her judgment is impaired by her predicament or she's simpleminded. It's a touching performance that's also infuriating because of the dangers she sets in motion all around her.The mise en scene here is one of a master. Midway through the film there's a stunning set piece where Marinca and her boyfriend are full screen at a party the camera never moves and they don't speak a word while adults chatter all around them while only occasionally hands enter the frame. The tension that results is almost unbearable when a telephone rings off in the distance and Marinca is unable to move to find out if it's a desperate call for help...or simply someone calling to wish Happy Birthday.There are many many such fine moments in this movie. It shows that horror isn't necessarily the boogie man or a creature from outer space. It can be of our own making both individually and by the government that rules us.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cristian Mungiu's film is the most successful in what is called the Romanian Cinama New Wave although it's not the very best in my opinion. I liked more 'The Death of Dante Lazarescu' and even 'California Dreamin' Nesfarsit' had better chances from start. And yet '432' succeeded better than other because it vibrates different chords in the viewers souls and on different planes. Women will resonate with the story of the imposed tragedy at a personal and national level resulted from the antiabortion policies in Communist Romania and one cannot say it's only a prochoice movie it's a real indictment. If one is interested in recent European history he may see the results of what communist propaganda named the Golden Age an apocalyptic landscape of cold dark and loneliness. If you are Romanian and lived these times you may feel you returned in time and the end of the movie may seem the awakening from a recurring nightmare.And if you are a fan of good cinema you will admire the virtuosity of a director who learned perfectly the lessons of Jim Jarmusch and DOGMA and transfered them in the East European space. You need the hand of a master to create those those long shots in which every detail is in place camera actors lights and voices. I see from time to time older Romanian movies where I observe not that much the lack of technical means in the 70s or 80s but more the lack of capacity of the directors to compensate this disadvantages with simplicity of concept and turn them into quality as other directors from less privileged schools of cinema have done. Well the last films of directors like Mungiu or the late Nemescu I could see a jump ahead in quality of expression that takes many generations for other film schools.There are many memorable scenes in this film. One of them describes a family dinner where the principal character a student from a lesser means family arrives invited by her boyfriend. It's his mother's birthday and they have as guests two couples of friends from the local midupper class. The scene is a nine minute shot with fixed camera focusing on four characters sited at the head of the table with a few others voices being heard from out of the screen space. She is in the middle and obliged to listen and participate but she wants to be some other place near her friend who just underwent an illegal abortion. Every minute may be fatal for the life of her friend. The dialog is not meaningless it is a short novella on its own about the art of compromise necessary for survival in a dictatorship. And yet she is there and is not there  all looks like a Da Vinci painting with Jesus sited among the apostles but already in a different spiritual reality. Magnificent to follow as its character has its own life its like a concatenation of first plans one near the other.In another memorable scene Otilia runs in the night to get rid of the aborted child. It's one of these long and cold nights into which Romania was plunged at these times because of electricity savings. She runs on the streets scared scared not that much by the shades of the night but by the proof of the 'crime' she is carrying and which can incriminate her for many years of jail if she is caught. Best horror scene of the year in my view.Anamaria Marinca is superb in the role of Otilia. No mannerism no melodrama no makeup  the actress is just living the character of a girl ready to sacrifice everything to help her naive and maybe a little dumb friend. It is by this humanity of the simple people that dictatorship can be survived at the human level the film seems to say.'432' is a candidate for the best foreign film at the Oscars but I am afraid it will not get the prize. The film starts slowly and needs patience to get the sense and many jurors may not get over the first third. The interest for EastEuropean cinema is decreasing it's not such a new thing any longer and Romanian cinema is little known out of Europe. Anyway Oscar or not this film is simply good and it demonstrates that the Romanian cinema passed the period of transition and it's time for maturity. It's now even harder as Romanian directors will need to find the inspiration to make films that do not look that much into the past but still can catch the interest of the local and international audiences. It will be interesting to follow.".

It's now even harder as Romanian directors will need to find the inspiration to make films that do not look that much into the past but still can catch the interest of the local and international audiences. It will be interesting to follow.";

Wade. Reminiscent of the style of the Dardenne Brothers with its closeups and handheld camera the film is mostly understated and key events happen off camera with one glaring exception yet it is a very demanding film powerfully acted and totally convincing as uncompromising as any film I have seen in recent memory.Set in Romania in 1987 during the final days of the Ceausescu regime 432 conveys a pervasive grayness that underscores the sterility of life in Eastern Europe at the time. If there was a bright and happy side to life in Romania in the late eighties you will not find it here. For the first thirty minutes preparations are being made for an unspecified event by two students in a college dormitory in Bucharest that looks like the interior of a hotel scheduled for demolition. One roommate Gabita Laura Vasiliu sends the other Otilla Anamaria Marinca to procure items such as cigarettes soaps and beauty items and to borrow money from friends but we do not learn what the money is for. The two women are very different. Gabita is passive almost helpless while Otilla is more self assured and outgoing though she is also circumspect in displaying her emotions.Mingu does not show us the world in which the girls live or any of the circumstances that led to Gabita's drastic decision to have the abortion. It is just a given. When it is revealed that Gabita is pregnant and is seeking an abortion it is the more aggressive Otilla who makes the arrangements. Trying to book a room at the hotels that were suggested Otilla is thwarted by cold bureaucratic clerks who act as if they just came from the hospital attending Mr. Lazarescu. Gabita's failure to confirm hotel reservations means that Otilla has to settle for a third hotel not on the list. When she meets with Mr. Bebe Vlad Ivanov the illegal abortionist he is perturbed that she came instead of Gabita and even more distressed that neither of the two hotels he suggested were booked.A scene outside a building in which Bebe scolds his elderly mother creates more anxiety for Otilla and the meeting at the hotel between the two women and the abortionist is replete with threats bullying tactics and demands for more money. When the sleazy abortionist discovers that Gabita is not two months pregnant as she had said but 4 months 3 weeks and 2 days he ups the ante. Cynically citing the risks he is taking that could result in a long prison term Bebe only agrees to perform the abortion after both women reluctantly agree to have sex with him. Heightening the feeling of uneasiness Otilla leaves Gabita alone in her hotel room propped up on two pillows unable to move as she fulfills a promise to her boyfriend Adi Alex Potocean to attend his mother's birthday party.Otilla is sullen and uncommunicative and the conversation among family members goes on and on making her feel more and more isolated. One relative criticizes her asking for a cigarette and goes into a speech about the failings of the younger generation as Otilla looks for a reason to leave. As the film winds to a gripping conclusion the almost unbearable tension had many in the sold out audience stirring uncomfortably in their seats. Though 4 Months 3 Weeks 2 Days depicts the oppressive nature of the social system and its laws it is not a polemic against Communism or illegal abortions but is more about the dignity of two women friends who are willing to take risks and sacrifice for each other without expectation of reward or even thanks.".

The setting is grim and the bleached out film stock adds to the jittery camera work and gives an uneasy feeling throughout instantly you are transported to a time where people barter with tic tacs cigarettes and powdered milk and the promise of sugar is a dream to many and a reality to only a few. Gabita's predicament and subsequent journey both physically and mentally are what drives the film but its shown mainly through the eyes of her friend and roommate Otilia who as well as making and carrying out the arrangements has to make some startling sacrifices and ones that she will have memory of forever as will you the audience long after the film has finished. Although not an easy watch and considering the subject matter not something you can say you 'enjoyed' it is none the less a brilliant piece of filmmaking subtle and emotive with very real character studies. A brutal in your face look at a bleak time in history how a leader destroyed the economy of a country and what that did to everyday life and a reminder of how far behind the rest of us Eastern Europe was before the fall of the Iron curtain and particularly Romania before the Revolution of 1989.".

Pregnant student Gabita and her roommate Otilia check into a cheap hotel where a backstreet abortionist called Bebe is going to deal with Gabita's problem. Under Romanian law the degree of illegality depends on how long Gabita has been pregnant on this subject as on most others she is worryingly vague. Very cleverly the writer makes Otilia the more resourceful of the girls the protagonist. Otilia needs all her courage to deal with the suspicious hotel staff to meet Bebe's demands to evade the police and jail. The obvious words to use are spare direct realistic. The suspense generated is astonishing. The question of whether abortion is right or wrong is irrelevant to the psychology of the film  all that matters is that it is dangerous.

It's a movie that will make you feel like a human being again and after seeing it you will surely think much better about Romanian cinematography. The movie is a drama of a human being that is oppressed by the communist regime in Romania one of the most criminal regimes of this century.In the last years of the Romanian communism the dictator's wife Elena Ceausescu made it clear for everyone that abortion is no longer permitted and that had a lot of implications later on. Although the movie is not about the regime itself but about the character and her personal drama. 4 Months 3 Weeks  2 Days is supposedly the beginning of a series of films Mungiu is hoping to make called The Golden Age each about life in Communist Romania. I hope he's successful if this film is an example of the kind of roughhew humanity and blunt realism we can expect in future films I'd definitely seek them out. As it is 4 Months 3 Weeks  2 Days moved me and challenged me made me feel and made me think demonstrated the personal and political challenges of a heartbreaking choice that in many ways is no choice at all and that's a rare enough achievement and one worthy of seeking out.This movie is a work of art".

It's a movie that will make you feel like a human being again and after seeing it you will surely think much better about Romanian cinematography. The movie is a drama of a human being that is oppressed by the communist regime in Romania one of the most criminal regimes of this century.In the last years of the Romanian communism the dictator's wife Elena Ceausescu made it clear for everyone that abortion is no longer permitted and that had a lot of implications later on. Although the movie is not about the regime itself but about the character and her personal drama. 4 Months 3 Weeks  2 Days is supposedly the beginning of a series of films Mungiu is hoping to make called The Golden Age each about life in Communist Romania. I hope he's successful if this film is an example of the kind of roughhew humanity and blunt realism we can expect in future films I'd definitely seek them out. As it is 4 Months 3 Weeks  2 Days moved me and challenged me made me feel and made me think demonstrated the personal and political challenges of a heartbreaking choice that in many ways is no choice at all and that's a rare enough achievement and one worthy of seeking out.This movie is a work of art";

It is also a strong and powerful statement of friendship and what it truly means. There is no way that Otilia Anamaria Marinca is a fair weather friend. She experienced the same pain as her friend. She was there for her.Watching this one can only realize the importance of being there for all women. As the forces of evil want to return us back to preRoe days just like Communist Romania we have to be eternally vigilant lest these procedures once again become common in our country and women are mistreated as they are in this film.This is the most powerful film I have ever seen. It will wrench your gut and really cause you to experience some emotions that you'd really not wish to experience.Strongly recommended!".

Which is odd because usually i go to movies to see how clever a filmmaker can be with twisting reality. But this was clearly magic to have been able to present a simple act walking in a simple composition face dead center with all of the familiar elements of nighttime in the city and brought it all together to heighten the experience of this girl carrying what it seems like all the worry in the world. It brought me back an almost childishimmediate feeling of being afraid walking alone at night but of course compared to film i've never walked alone at night with that much at stake.But this is where the movie is most successful the film presents you with people living in a type of harsh system that i can't imagine here living in the states. But the feelings and emotions that are portrayed are universal the feeling of being young and afraid feeling of sneaking behind the law risking something for your friend  feeling of regret. And in this film the moral compass is clear they know the system is unjust and they do things out of love and care for one another.But for us here in the states where government and law has seeped itself into everything where we don't sometimes realized our own systematic oppression how much of our sense of rightwrong is driven by government and the law? how much of it is actually driven by love and passion for real people?".

	schema:reviewBody "The most recent Palm D'Or winner was at first a little perplexing to me and had a feeling of it slightly throughout its near twohour running time. It starts off looking like a movie about nothing and not the interesting awesome kind of nothing that is about something with a woman going about some busy business is a dorm and meeting and talking with her boyfriend. Then it segues into a story of her attempts to help out her friend procure an illegal abortion in a hotel room under some harsh circumstances i.e. the girl is timid and uneasy in her ignorance the man performing it is cold and cruel and a professional pig the general fear and loathing of the situation. But Mingiu's style is something that took me totally off my guard and I wasn't sure for the better.The film contends with the likes of Woyzek of having a ridiculous among of longtakes and long as in tenminute length the variety that would've been impossible decades ago with these characters in a bind of usually holding back emotions under these complex set of circumstances where the fear of getting caught goes hand in hand with the problems of guilt in a society that shouldn't have that instilled in people in the first place. I even though once or twice what's all the hoopla about with this movie? But since I saw it yesterday the film hasn't left my mind and considering the little problems I still have with it mostly involving one or two scenes that for all intents and purposes do overrun their length of a take it's much more of a remarkable film that I thought right after seeing it. It's a lot like if Bresson shot a home movie set in Romania in Communist era times of dread where a character like the lead Otilia Anamaria Minca is so restrained we wonder if she'll suddenly burst at the seams at any moment. Once or twice she and the perpetually quiet and insipid character Gabita Laura Vasiliu break down in their emotion but it's all mostly unsentimental in portrayal.So perhaps think L'Infant also a recent Golden Palm winner only with a stronger and much more unforgiving message at the core of an abortion it's never easy for anybody on any side least of all for the fetus dumped away in some dark room or other away from the dogs that could tear it to pieces and as something that will be at worst a skeleton in the closet. But the style of the picture is most striking because of how it tries to be somehow immediate and detached we're caught without a cut at times like someone is carefully not Cloverfield holding the camera getting down every little gesture every little eye movement and not with a cutaway or closeup. Lighting is also minimal or for the basics like when we're at the dinner table with her boyfriend's family or especially at dark when she's walking around in a daze. It's a challenging perspective that dare I say it amongst all who love the film so veers on pretension.But as I said the power to stay with me hasn't diminished and like any powerful piece of European cinema that tries to provoke through suggestion through subtext and through a precise cruel naturalistic setting it doesn't go away very easily. 8.510".

This is somehow ironic because this movie is actually about the so called golden age of Rmania. This age was hardly golden though. Anyway I didn't see this movie as a movie about communism. For me it was a display of the multifaceted human drama from a common perspective. This movie is all about perspective. Camera angle perspective focusing they all have something to say. And they are doing a great job in saying it. A much better job than all the special effects that we are blown away by in most modern films. Romanian film makers maybe because they are poor are forced to make art because they can't afford special effects. They make art as Hithcock and Bergman did. I will say no more about this film except GO SEE IT! But first to really enjoy it start learning romanian !".

	schema:reviewBody "Once we start there's no turning back.4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days is a Romanian film directed by Cristian Mungiu which won the Palm D'Or in the Cannes Film Festival in 2007 confirming the resurgence of the New Wave of Romanian Cinema. Other Romanian films that have been a part of this movement include 1208 East of Bucharest The Death of Mr. Lazarescu and Tales from the Golden Age. I'm on the minority here when I say that I didn't enjoy this film because the film has won several important awards and has been considered a masterpiece by most critics. As much as I wanted to enjoy this film I have to be honest and say I felt it was a dull and boring movie. I tend to enjoy these character driven dramas but I really never felt connected with the characters here and never felt the suspense that most people felt when they watched this. There were a few enjoyable moments and some strong performances but the plot was simple and I never was drawn into the story. Despite the great camera work and the excellent craft I never was attracted to this film or cared for the resolution. I'm sure it depicts perfectly the era when Romania was under Ceausescu's communist regime but having seen so many foreign films focusing on social issues I didn't think there was anything special that stood out here but I'm probably wrong because everyone else seemed to have loved this film.The film takes place during the final years of Ceausescu's communist regime in Rumania and it centers on a college student named Otilia Anamaria Marinca as she begins to make plans in order to help her roommate Gabita Laura Vasliu have an abortion. We don't really find out about the abortion until 30 minutes into the film but the trailers take away the suspense. The communist regime doesn't allow birth control nor abortion so they have to do things quietly and secretly. Otilia arranges to book a reservation at a hotel and picks up a doctor who has offered his service although it won't be free and it will cost them a little more than money. His name is Bebe Vlad Ivanov and he takes advantage of Gabita's desperation to have the abortion and her friend's willingness to help. Everything has to be done quietly in the hotel room because if they are caught they can end up in jail but Otilia also has to deal with her boyfriend Adi Alex Potocean as she has promised to visit him for his mom's birthday. There are a lot of things at stake here but Otilia is determined to help out her friend.One of the main issues I had with the film was that I never believed the friendship between Otilia and Gabita was strong enough for her to go through such extreme measures in order to help her. They seemed pretty distant and I never understood why she was willing to help. I have my theories but the film is purposefully ambiguous. It is slow paced and nothing really happens. I don't have an issue with this because in films like A Separation it still worked for me because I connected with the characters. Mungiu portrays the era really well and never takes sides on the pro abortion or pro life issue rather focusing on the dangers of the oppressive regime. It is a very realistic and dark film and Marinca gives a strong performance as the lead character. The best part of the film however was the scene where Ivanov's character manipulates the girls in the hotel room. He was great in that scene. I'm disappointed that I never got to appreciate the film as much as everyone else did but there is no denying that Mungiu directed a memorable film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie has been gaining a lot of momentum internationally. I think its exclusion from the 2008 Academy Awards has almost been a bigger marketing boost than a nomination would have gained. The transparent sterility of its title 4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days is the first clue to the interesting reception it has had.The name Stanley Kubrick is thrown around way too often. Whenever someone does something even vaguely like the handwriting on the walls of the Shining it's dubbed as Kubrick's vision or something equally stupid. 2007's Kubrick has been PT Anderson for There Will Be Blood. Whenever I read it in a review I feel as if Kubrick is the only other director's name the critic knows so he throws it in a few times with a copypaste on the computer.With that being established I think to compare one specific element of 4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days to some of Stanley Kubrick's movies is warranted and worthwhile. Kubrick's films are very precise. They are filmed and edited in a way that creates an incredibly crafted world controlling the viewer every step of the way. I find specific control more obvious in Kubrick's movies 2001 A Clockwork Orange Full Metal Jacket are the most resonant. Nothing is an accident. Or more importantly nothing seems an accident.4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days feels equally as unflinching in its control. In its sparse very cold direction it takes a firm grip of whoever is watching and manipulates them into just how they are meant to feel. Because of the film's dark subject matter and the harsh communist life backdrop this makes it very hard to watch. Director Cristian Mungiu knows what he is doing to his audience.There is an extended scene in the film that has become famous for frustrating its audience. I've read few user group comments as well as professional reviews about the film specifically mentioning this particular scene that have taken to it with quite a bit of hostility. The key character Otilia has dinner with her boyfriend's family and their friends. The conversation is idle and without explaining details the scene ends and the film continues along. i have read that people have become bored become angry almost outraged. Some found it to be frustrating in its displacement both from the perspective of a scene from the movie and of a character within in. Some found it fascinating and I am in that camp. I mentioned Kubrick's name because the style of his intense control in this scene becomes almost brutal. While Otilia simply sits for 10 minutes we are sat down. Munglu has us feeding out of his hand. After coming of out the film I felt like a child being guided through some kind of wet abandoned street. This was the only rest stop along the wayWhile having such a firm grip the film is careful not to be restrictive in its theme and philosophy. There is much to talk about and debate over. It doesn't tell us what to think. Its primary subject matter is abortion and telling its audience which side of the camp to sit would have been received terribly. The meticulous precision of Christian Munglu doesn't show us what to say it gives us the tools to have something to say. There is a lot to say about 4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days. It is a very rich film and does not simply tell the story of abortion. I've focused on how beautifully purposeful each frame of this film so hopefully anyone who watches it to take it in accordingly. And take from there the issue or theme that resonates with them and a platform to work from.".

And Robert Downey Jr. just does a tremendous job  he is so talented. When the four spirits enter his body at different times it's amazing how well he portrays each one with such accuracy especially as Penny like he's really that person. The humor never misses a beat.

He is one of our few actors that can do what I call folded acting a selfawareness that communicates itself. This is just a kind of language of mental mathematics  one that I believe makes people more susceptible to addictive behavior. This film was done right after the rather amazing Chaplin but before it was released. I think it is pretty effective writing and I will recommend it on that score.But there are two scenes that really worked for me. One is the setup the other the payoff. The setup is the six year old Downey sings in the bathroom with his four ghost friends. It is 1965 and we are singing walk like a man already an iconic song. The walls reverberate like schoolboy toilet walls do  or used to when they were 100 tile and urinals were lined up. It has energy. The boy actor is terrific. The joke at the time is a nun looks in and sees and hears only the boy. Mildly funny. Mildly endearing.Now move forward to later when the adult Downey reencounters the ghosts. He has just done something companionable and likes hanging out. They are crossing Post street in San Francisco  a regular street. They break out into this song. The whole thing lasts only a minute or so before being interrupted by an iconic bus to heaven. But watch the ensemble do their strutting to the song just as if they were still stuck in 1963 when the song appeared... except for Downey. Look at what he does here hands in pockets singing the lead. When I saw this in 1993 I knew this man would be important. This 20 or 30 seconds. It is because the context is all about inhabiting bodies and carrying selves. He does the oh gosh now I'm someone else bit with awareness of both beings. In this scene he is three persons the child the adult the actor. He spoke about this at the time. Here you can see virtually everything he brought to Tropic Thunder.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

Sort of. Dead imaginary friends that only he can see.Many years ago some people boarded a bus including Charles Grodin and Tom Sizemore. The bus flipped over a bridge and everyone died going to heaven. But then they came back down involuntarily to Downey as a child and stayed with him for a few years. Every time they tried to leave him they were pulled back to him. Until he was about eight then they somehow managed to leave because they were influencing his schoolwork and life I don't remember how they got out of it. Now they're back to haunt him again because they need him to help get to heaven.I haven't seen this movie in a few years so I'm a bit rusty on the plot summary but I remember that I found it enjoyable and sweet. There aren't any big complexities here just some good old fashioned fun.Robert Downey Jr. is convincing in his role as is the rest of the cast. I've liked Charles Grodin and Tom Sizemore for quite some time and they got to show off their talent here. Too bad Grodin left the showbiz scene because I really did enjoy him in films. He wasn't over the top of crazy he seemed very normal and played very normal characters Beethoven Midnight Run.I think that this is the perfect example of romantic comedies that have both wit and respect for the audience. In a time of cheap teen flicks and socalled romantic comedies the rare FUNNY romantic comedy that comes along is usually very good When Harry Met Sally Sleepless in Seattle While You Were Sleeping As Good as it Gets etc.. While Heart and Souls isn't a great romantic comedy it's above average and definitely recommendable.3.55 Stars".

Now they're back to haunt him again because they need him to help get to heaven.I haven't seen this movie in a few years so I'm a bit rusty on the plot summary but I remember that I found it enjoyable and sweet. There aren't any big complexities here just some good old fashioned fun.Robert Downey Jr. is convincing in his role as is the rest of the cast. I've liked Charles Grodin and Tom Sizemore for quite some time and they got to show off their talent here. Too bad Grodin left the showbiz scene because I really did enjoy him in films. He wasn't over the top of crazy he seemed very normal and played very normal characters Beethoven Midnight Run.I think that this is the perfect example of romantic comedies that have both wit and respect for the audience. In a time of cheap teen flicks and socalled romantic comedies the rare FUNNY romantic comedy that comes along is usually very good When Harry Met Sally Sleepless in Seattle While You Were Sleeping As Good as it Gets etc.. While Heart and Souls isn't a great romantic comedy it's above average and definitely recommendable.3.55 Stars";

It is handled with deft physical comedy Downey's tabletumbling at a stuffy board meeting as the result of souls invading his body is on a par with Chaplin and Keaton but it is also one of the most loving stories with truly loving characters even Sizemore I've ever seen. The four vignettes with Sizemore making a former bad deed right Grodin overcoming stage fright Woodard finding her children and Sedgewick tracking down the one that got away are quite nice even bewitching. Bewitching is the only way I can describe a moment like Woodard's recognition of a lost son or Sedgewick being granted a moment of mortal embrace even if just for a second or two.

Now he is an adult and has forgotten about them but wait they appear again and Tom somehow manages to see them again and that's not it the bus driver has returned saying he's come to take them to Heaven after all those years idiot says he was supposed to get them but went seeing some relatives and the ghosts are sore at him so they made a deal he'll get them once they complete what they've wanted do. And Tom should help them since he can only see them at the same time trying get things right with his girlfriend. Overall this is a very touching and heart warming movie and a very good comedy everyone can enjoy not a lot of violence or swearing so anyone can enjoy it. And the ending theme is also great and touching.".

	schema:reviewBody "An Unfinished Life may be the sweetest movie you'll see this year and certainly the most beautiful. Take yourself to the theater then look forward to the DVD. We are treated to watch Robert Redford play a perfect curmudgeon crusty craggy a rancher named Einar Gilkyson in his 60's who has a lot to do every day. His first duty is to take care of his best friend and long time cowboy buddy Mitch Bradley played by Morgan Freeman. Then he gets to milk the cows. Their friendship carries the film through the ups and downs of life with Mitch as the guiding light to Einar's disgruntled reality. Unable to pull her own life together Einar's daughterinlaw arrives with Einar's granddaugther in tow needing a temporary place to stay. Jennifer Lopez plays Jean and her daughter Giff is well played by Becca Gardner. The daughterinlaw is immediately rejected by Einar still feeling the loss of his son and blaming her for it. They stay any way and the story develops their lives as the four of them work out their differences while living on the ranch in a stunningly beautiful valley. Josh Lucas plays the local sheriff a handsome man that reminds one of the younger Robert Redford. He gives spark to Lopezs character while being a complete gentleman. An Unfinished Life brings a man and a bear together to acknowledge each others strengths and brings an unhappy bitter man to realize that he still has an amazing family right in front of him. Appreciation and forgiveness along with some adversity show us that unity is still possible even given previous misunderstandings and alienation's.Every one in the film does a good job and you feel like you have just visited the ranch and had dinner with these characters and you want to go back for breakfast. The relationships in this film are realistic and intelligent not sappy nor Hollywood glossy.This is a wonderful film and it is a great delight to watch Redford Freeman Lopez Lucas and Gardner play their parts in such gorgeous scenery. There is plenty of humor in the film and an honest look at how we work out our emotional dilemmas and hang ups and eventually bring out the best in ourselves often by being around someone else's best. You will feel bested yourself for watching this fine film. Compliments especially to Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman a dynamic duo. They are a perfect compliment to each other and their maturity is a great bonus to the film.".

That's the case of Redford's character. Without a way to release himself he has managed to create a pretty miserable existence for himself. The only redeeming moment arising from the relationship with his best friend.Things are bound to change with the arrival of his daughterinlaw and the granddaughter he never knew existed. The drama unfolds quite nicely and our hearts are touched along the way. It's a quiet movie full of lovely vistas and some intense drama. It doesn't pack the punch of Million Dollar Baby a film which it's bound to recall because of the Freeman's character dynamics.

This cast for years have entertained me through splendid movies such as Selena Out of Sight The Way We Were and Million Dollar Baby. Although very aware of the skepticiscm of having La Lopez in a film with Oscar performing costars would prove to show ones stubbornness. Lopez gives a knockout performance and I would challenge anyone who says she was miscast for this role. Isn't it the job of the actor to travel outside of their character and convey the feelings of another. I don't think much is needed to be said about Redford's and Morgan's heartbreaking performances. Lasse Halstrom has outdone himself again he has brought justice to the splendid novel by Mark Spragg. I trust all of you will give this Oscar worthy movie a shot before you draw any of your conclusions. 'An Unfinished Life' reminds me of an old family western filled with heart and emotion.

Jennifer Lopez was surprisingly good as the victim of domestic abuse. The little girl who played her daughter was also excellent.As my sister and I left the theater a woman with a clipboard was asking for comments. We both said It was great.

I was wrong not that either Redford or Freeman's performances were nothing less than excellent but the job done by Becca Gardner was especially wonderful. In fact in my opinion she stole the show. Gardner's portrayal of the Griff Gilkyson character was a special one indeed. And yes I must admit I even enjoyed Jennifer Lopez in this movie. All in all a very solid movie that I enjoyed so much.

And that is something. Each character and player when heshe is on screen is telling you so many things at a time that you get completely engrossed in their story.Jennifer Lopez plays a single mother running away from her abusivetypical boy friend Damian Lewis and has no where to go but to her Fatherinlaw who hates her. Fatherinlaw is of course Robert Redford who is not looking forward to anything in life and his only real purpose in living seems to be to take care of his wounded friend Morgan Freeman. There is Bear which wounded Freeman and is the terror element in the otherwise peaceful Wyoming smashing locales town and there is Josh Lucas the love interestsheriff for Jenny's Cinderella. There is dbutant Becca Gardner the eventempered daughter of Jenny's. Camrein Maynheim The Practice has a supporting role. And there I finish the list of principal characters in the movie.Now why I am taking pains to mention each one of them is because they are who make this movie watchable. Especially FreemanGardner and Redford in that order. Not that others do a bad job. But these three provide all the entertainment. None of the characters are living in what we would call normal circumstances in any way. At the same time there is nothing new about the story they are telling. It is just the way they go about telling it. Unhurriedly through gestures and expressions breathing life into these stereotypes. There is redemption for everyone involved and that is expected. But the story manages to teach you something and not in a very persuasive manner. That is the redeeming feature of the movie and may be that is the flaw. It will fail to influence too many some might even find it boring. But I guess that is Okay because for the few viewers who like an optimistic story told with compassionate characters played by expert actors this one is worth watching.".

However he seemed a little wooden and unemotional in some of his past roles i.e. Out of Africa even though this is one of my favorite Redford movies. The hair washing scene is so sexy!. I was just so impressed with his portrayal of an angry and bitter man. He had a depth to his character that I've never seen him convey before. If you're a Redford fan you will truly enjoy this gorgeous and thought provoking movie. I wish Redford would win a Best Actor Oscar before he retires.Also I think Morgan Freeman brings out the best in his fellow actors. He  Redford have excellent chemistry. Morgan is amazing. He has such a classy and soulful spirit.Everyone is perfectly cast in the movie. The little girl nearly steals the show from the seasoned actors. It's a must see.

	schema:reviewBody "One of the latest Miramax productions to leave the studio shelf after a lengthy hiatus is An Unfinished Life by director Lasse Hallstrom whose previous dramas have all focused on characterdriven relationships within a small town setting.Robert Redford portrays Einar Gilkyson a disgruntled recovering alcoholic and Wyoming rancher. Besides his farming duties he must also tend to the daily care of his former ranch hand Mitch Bradley Morgan Freeman whose injuries from a recent bear mauling have forced him to retire.Einar is still grieving the death of his son in an automobile accident which occurred over a decade ago. But soon he experiences setbacks in his recovery when his estranged daughterinlaw Jean Jennifer Lopez unexpectedly arrives with her 11year old daughter Griff Becca Gardner.Jean has just fled an abusive relationship and with no other available refuge is hoping to find shelter in the only place she's familiar with. At first Einar makes it clear that she isn't welcome in his home. For years he has harbored bitterness towards her and has held her responsible for his son's death.Eventually he reluctantly agrees to allow Jean and Griff to settle into an unused storage room and even begins warming up towards his newlyfound granddaughter.Jean begins to stabilize her life by getting a job at a diner while finding comfort and security within the affections of the town sheriff Josh Lucas and forming a friendship with a fellow waitress Camryn Manheim who is also dealing with a tragedy of her own. She also attempts to make progress in her reconciliation with Einar.Meanwhile outside enemies arrive on the homestead in the form of Jean's exboyfriend Damian Lewis returning to reclaim what is rightfully his as well as the bear responsible for Mitch's injuries.The film deeply emphasizes the subjects of forgiveness the healing of both physical and emotional wounds as well as being set free from life's personal trappings.Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman two longestablished veteran performers present a combination of easy chemistry and camaraderie throughout reminding us of the companionship and wise guidance Freeman offered to Clint Eastwood's diamondintherough character in Million Dollar Baby.Jennifer Lopez relies on the battered woman role she portrayed in another domestic abuse film Enough bringing both strength and vulnerability to Jean's attributes. Here we can learn something from this film's message and forgive Lopez for her participation in the disastrous Gigli. It's obvious that she can be a very capable actress if given the right material.As for newcomer Becca Gardner she delivers a realistic and precocious insight throughout her role serving as a solid anchor for all of the lost adults around her.The bear also deserves an honorable mention for his largely noticeable presence which serves as an important symbolic element.While some will find the convenient and precipitated resolutions of a decadelong feud a bit unrealistic others will be charmed by the film's postcard scenery and satisfied with its happy ending.".

With nowhere else to go she decides that the safest place to go and shelter herself and her daughter is moving back to the country side and that means having to go face to face with her stillgrieving fatherinlaw played to perfection by Robert Redford. Jlo sizzles in this role too bad she was ignored around awards season. The young actress who plays her daughter in the film steals a lot of scenes from Lopez but thankfully she doesn't steal the entire show. Morgan Freeman is also fine as a close friend of Redford's character who has been maimed by a bear and he Freeman sort of serves as the conscience of the film as usual. But nevertheless I believe this was the role that brought him his first Academy award. Director Lasse Hallstrom achieves cinematic gold by capturing the scenic natural beauty of the countryside but not allowing it to overpower the film. Don't miss a stirring cameo performance by the eloquently divine Camryn Manheim who plays a woman with a heartbreaking past. One thing that could have been left on the cutting room floor was Jlo's sex scene with the sheriff played by Josh Lucas. I mean come on it didn't even fit the flow of the film. I know the writers and directors probably didn't want to waste Josh's hotness and Jlo's sexiness but please sometimes sex isn't everything! This film could have easily been a perfect 10 without that stupid scene.".

A lot of magnificent scenery with fantastic cinematography and an old curmudgeon unaware that he's just waiting on a chance at redemption. Redford cares deeply about his movies and he always makes them highquality and totally out of step with the current fashion. This is a good thing if you're not particularly enthusiastic about still more comicbook flicks and space fantasies and remakes and movies based on old TV shows along with explosions and crazy driving.This time around Redford is in fine form as always and he has skillful backup again as always. He's not interested in hogging the screen and insists on having perfectlytuned performances from the other characters. There's really nothing left to say about Morgan Freeman but Jennifer Lopez is the big surprise here. Deglammed from a magazine cover goddess to a naturally pretty stressedout mistakeprone woman in her mid30s and at the end of her rope JLo fits right in with her esteemed colleagues and in fact holds her own with them. She's rarely praised for her acting but she certainly deserves it for this role. These three hold down the center of the film but everybody else in the cast also does superb work. Not a single dud in the bunch.Redford's Einar has let himself many years ago. He's unshaven his hair sticks out in all directions he's not clean nor does he wear clean clothes. He clearly just doesn't give a bowel movement. When I was little I had a greatuncle who looked the same way and visits to his house were always guaranteed to be an experience. So Einar is an archetype and a very good one. He and Morgan Freeman's Mitch are two very badly damaged men Einar psychologically and Mitch physically. Meanwhile JLo's Jean has run out of options and she's forced to turn to the one man and to return to the one place that she swore she'd never go near again. At first glance the unfinished life in the title seems to refer to Einar's longdead son but it turns out that it's also about Einar and Jean and Mitch. All three had their lives stopped by some tragedy and they learn to finally move on with the help of the other two.Anyway An Unfinished Life is an enjoyable leisurely easygoing movie experience and I highly recommend it. Especially if you're looking for a break from our routine movie options like I said earlier.".

	schema:headline " Possibly an Oscar hopeful...";
	schema:reviewBody "I loved this film it was a beautiful story. It has its ups and its downs. Its ups the acting its downs the pace. Worse films have won Oscars so I definitely think this should be considered. At times its fantastic at other times it just seems to raise its hand in the air frantically begging for an Oscar. This film would have been much better if it was made for the purpose of telling a great story not for the purpose of getting an Oscar.Redford is great. He is cast well and at most times owns the part of Einar Gilkyson. I am biased however by having read half the book before I saw the film didn't have time to finish it. The film tried to hard to make Einar a tough guy physically. For example the scene where the two drunk guys come in the restaurant and harass Nina the waitressowner played by Camryn Manheim. In the book Redford just simply goes over and talks to them and actually gets scared that they might kick his butt and another character comes in to reprimand them. The film has Redford smashing their heads in with a coffee pot and threatening them with a fork in the throat. I cannot decide whether I like this change or not. I cannot help but notice Redford in a different light in this film. He looks different and his character is much different than other characters in his career. He seemed to take a risk with this character and it turned out for the better.Morgan Freeman is fantastic. I walked into the movie hoping not to see a clitche'd Freeman as the prophetpreacherconscience of the film. I must admit that at a lot of times the typical Freeman does comes to the surface and he gets almost all of the proverbial lines of the film. However unlike the typical narrator role he plays he brings personality and humor to the part of Mitch Bradley. Mitch is not perfect and isn't just there for the sake of having a preachercharacter on the ranch. He goes through his own subplot of forgiveness with the bear that attacked him. Many can take this scene is corny and a clitche but I think his best moment in the film is his discovery of the bear on his property near the end. You can see the fear in his eyes he's on crutches and has nowhere to run. Te bear charges him and he closes his eyes and repeats Just keep going. The bear gets forgiveness which is representation of what should be received by Jean.Jennifer Lopez is not bad in this film at all. In fact I almost argue that this is her best performance since Out Of Sight. My judgement of her performance was biased however having read half the book. I did not agree with the characterization Jennifer chose of Jean. Jennifer's Jean draws too much inspiration from Slim Hiller in Enough. Jennifer plays her to be too much of a victim at times. The book had Jean as a flirtatious sexual free spirit that smoked way too much. There is a small sex scene between her and Josh Lucas in the beginning of the film which does not fit AT ALL. If Jennifer played Jean as a more sexual even a little trashier dare I say with bigger flaws in her morale about sex the scene would've made much more sense. I commend Jennifer for FINALLY playing a character with flaws but I think she still could've dug a little deeper. In certain scenes you feel she walks through phoning in her lines and in other scenes she shines and you almost want to hand her an Oscar. Many people gave her flack for looking way too glamorous to play this part. First of all that's ridiculous and we all need to stop thinking actresses need to ugly themselves to deliver a good performance. Jean was supposed to be beautiful. Jean wore lots of makeup so Jennifer did too. There is dialogue that even indicated this I think every customer we had today just came to get a glimpse of you. Jennifer's greatest work in this film includes hardly any dialogue at all the scene in which she watches a couple argue from behind the restaurant.The role of Jean Gilkyson dances on the line of being a lead character and a supporting character which can easily be debated wither way. I'm going to go with supporting. Jean doesn't go through a strong enough transformation to be considered a lead. At times you feel her presence is only necessary for the sake of Einar to move on and offer forgiveness. A transformation from beginning to end is present just not strong enough.The love story between Jean and Crane is underdeveloped as someone else on here stated.All in all a good film. Incredibly slowpaced and dull at times but well done. It deserves to be considered by the Oscars but it doesn't deserve to win. As for the subject everyone's talking about Jennifer Lopez and an Oscar. No she doesn't deserve and Oscar for this film. Maybe possibly a nomination but not Oscarworthy. She's on her way though and this film is definitely a step in the right direction.".

Morgan Freeman plays the same type of supporting character we all loved in Million Dollar Baby which I think was the best movie of the year so far to this one. Robert Redford is perfect for his role and gets the job done as usual. Kudos to JLo for not screwing it up. She didn't do a bad job at all. I don't know who the little girl is but she did a very good job too.I enjoyed this film just as much as Million Dollar Baby even though it wasn't as poetic it is just as uplifting and entertaining.

	schema:reviewBody "I was able to attend the sneak preview of An Unfinished Life Saturday night in Muvico Paradise Theater in Florida. For about nine years now i have been what one would call an Oscar predictor. I predict movies and their potential to compete in every year at the Oscars. Not saying that that's what I do for a living but I first started in the year of 1997 with movies of the likes of Titanic L.A Confidential Good Will Hunting Armistead just to name a few. The reason why i even started the hobby was so i could bond with my little brother and so we could be able to share a common interest. As the years went by I grew more attached to what i call the job and more attached to the idea of being able to share something in common with my brother. I had heard about An Unfinished Life since last year and even put deep consideration into its chances for an Oscar. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed when Miramax pushed it to next year along with Proof. I assumed it was a bad movie shelved and forgotten especially after a series of mixed reviews as of late. We went in like I said before not expecting a whole lot of the shelved film and were ready to be either surprised or the more likely disappointed...actual review Coming out of the theater me and my brother were in a word surprised and in all aspects of the film. We thought the film was actually pretty damn good despite being sort of clich and sometimes predictable.The movie is a story about forgiveness as it says in every single website that the film appears in. But what many fail to understand is that the movie in fact is a story of letting go of the inner depth person one can be as a result of pain anguish bitterness loss hatred depression and most noticeably the horrible death and loneliness of sorrow. It is also a story of a sense of hope and redemption one is able to see in the little things in this world and in the most unexpected and lifechanging obstacles of life. An Unfinished Life exceeds in illustrating that beautifully and profoundly.The movie did however have it's difficulties and problems. Some scenes I felt could have been cut like when Lopez and Lucas decide after just meeting each other twice to go off into some deserted area and have sex. Also i felt that some scenes didn't work bc they just edited a little too much like the whole subplot with the abusive boyfriend. The audience just doesn't get that feel from Lewis' character because the character just shows up too little or he just isn't able to capture the true strength of someone feared and dreaded by all dueto screen time and the material provided during his screen time. Another problem was the relationship bw Lucas and Lopez which is as well underdeveloped. At the end of the film your still not quite sure if they are just friends or friends who truly feel something towards each other weather it be pity or love or intimacy etc.. Another major problem was that some scenes just felt too quick compared to other scenes that seemed to long. For me the biggest problem of the film was the editing.Now in my opinion the best thing about the entire movie is the performances. We'll start of with Redford. He is absolutely magnificent. It is definitely a Redford we haven't seen in a while. He's performance gives a great mix of tragedy and despair humor and deeply touching grief and dwelling. Some scenes like when Einer talks to his son or when he tries to let go of the tragedy he considers is his life or the scenes where he and Mitch Freeman remind us of their brilliant talent are truly genuine sincere wonderful and truly special.One of the most pleasantly surprising elements of the movie is Jennifer Lopez. In this film Lopez is really able to show us a side of herself that we haven't seen since oh well Out of Sight. Jennifer Lopez is believable in every aspect as a masochistic woman who is susceptible to mistakes and tries her best to be a good mom even when she fails to realize all the pain she makes her daughter go through even if it's not intentionally. Some scenes like when she tells Lucas of her abusive boyfriend seem to appear almost pitch perfect. And her big scene stealer is extremely impressive expressing a great amount of fear and anguish and regret. That scene and the role itself is an incredible achievement one of which she herself should be proud of.Freeman is absolutely wonderful in the film as well. Even though it's basically kind of the same role he always plays he portrays his role with enough sadness enough humor and enough life to make you once again forget that it's Freeman. Scenes where he is finally able to achieve strength and courage over the bear that ruined his life and his unfolding heart towards Griff prove to be extremely effective. The young actress who plays Griff Becca Gardner is also excellent in the film. Despite being surrounded by A list actors the little 11 year old is able to hold her own ground and make herself stand out. Also the cinematography and score were beautiful.Despite its faults the movie is able to express a kind of power very rare in movies now a day. It is able to express the agony of truth and acceptance and the beautiful essence of hope which is most of the time the only thing a person has within themselves and in life. An Unfinished Life is a terrific accomplishment and I highly recommend it.".

I have long been a fan of both of the actors and figured this can't be all that bad. Well the two veteran actors play the parts well and Jennifer Lopez is solid in her role as well. The problem for the actors is the story which is so boring and predictable as to be one notch above torture. The plot is spoon fed to the viewer revealing the scope of the story very early in the film. J Lo as Jean is running away with her daughter from her abusive boyfriend to Einar's Redford ranch. Einar's son was killed in an accident in a car that Jean was driving. Freeman as Mitch is Einar's long time ranch hand who has been disabled by a bear mauling while Einar was drunk and unable to save Mitch from the attack. From there the film is about forgiveness. Will Einar forgive Jean? Will Mitch forgive Einar? Will Mitch forgive the bear? If you are still awake as the film progresses the the plot unwinds the story drags on it is very predictable boring and slow to the point of comatose. I bet you can guess the rest of this. JLo finds a job as waitress in a small town greasy spoon. A new love interest of course and the bad boyfriend comes back and Mitch visits the bear and on and on. It's not like I just don't like this type of story or film. I loved Nobody's Fool with Paul Newman. This has none of the charm humor or appeal of that film.I was in the hospital when I saw this film on cable. The doctor came in to explain to me the anesthesia and what to expect and when I'd wake from it and so forth. I thought to myself I don't need it just leave this movie on I'll be unconscious for hours.".

Two guys who crash weddings to pick up woman have zany adventures and learn a little something along the way. The real fun of this movie is in the actors who deliver their performances perfectly. Owen Wilson is the aging California surfer type who may be ready to move on with his life. Vince Vaughn is his best friend who frequently acts like a spoiled horny child but is actually a good guy. Christopher Walken is the slightly scary father of the love interest. So if you have seen Wilson in Shanghai Noon and Vaughn in Swingers and Walken in well almost anything he has ever made then you have seen these characters before. But still they just work well together here. The movie contains just enough real emotion to keep you caring and enough absurdity and broad physical comedy to keep you laughing. This isn't Shakespeare but it is funny. Highly recommend.".

This one it's hard to remember the best parts because there's so many of them.Unlike his previous films where Vince Vaughn is usually reduced to the role of 'scene stealer' here we get a full dose of Babaganush and he's in his finest form since 'Swingers'. If you liked him in his SwingersMade persona you'll love him here. Some of the riffs that he has literally will have you holding your sides with laughter.Owen Wilson is Owen Wilson. You either like him or you don't. He's more of the straight man in this film although he does have some pretty good lines too and he has great chemistry with Vaughn especially in the scenes where they're fighting. He's the ying to Vaughn's yang.The movie certainly 'earns' it's R rating. There's a healthy dose of nudity sex related hijinks and fbombs. But it's not 'gross out' humor a la American Pie. It pushes boundaries but not just in a 'shock value' way. It's genuinely funny.I saw the movie with a bunch of critics who usually the jaded type were laughing their asses of as well. Guys will love this movie and will be quoting it for the rest of the year. Girls will love it too though and there is a romantic subplot cheesy at times but forgivable given how funny the movie is with Rachael McAdams doing a great job as Owen Wilson's love interest. Isla Fischer plays the role of 'scene stealer' in this one serving as Vince Vaughn's psycho love interest. And Chris Walken is Chris Walken.So overall..inappropriate hilarious and glorious. Better than Oldschool. Way better than Anchorman. Best comedy of the year maybe the last couple of years.".

It is a shame it was cut from the movie but as the director's comments stated They just couldn't find a place where it would fit. I was very pleasantly surprised at the number of times I laughed out loud a rarity for me while watching comedies. The lines were witty the delivery was crisp and the jokes were mostly new and fresh. Rachel McAdams was stunning an excellent casting choice to play the object of Owen Wilson's desire. Despite the more or less rehashed plot two guys lie about themselves to meet women only to find that they now have a dilemma when they find 2 they really like the film is nonetheless novel and original. There are a number of obviously stereotypical characters drunken grandmother artistic introverted son psychotic cheating boyfriend immoral mother powerful father but they work in this film. Particularly the grandmother who is prone to drunken scatological exclamations had me laughing my head off. It was quite unexpected.Although many of the situations could come off as contrived they were secondary to the excellent repartee between Wilson and Vaughn. Their comic pairing worked to a T.R.".

Rachel McAdams was stunning an excellent casting choice to play the object of Owen Wilson's desire. Despite the more or less rehashed plot two guys lie about themselves to meet women only to find that they now have a dilemma when they find 2 they really like the film is nonetheless novel and original. There are a number of obviously stereotypical characters drunken grandmother artistic introverted son psychotic cheating boyfriend immoral mother powerful father but they work in this film. Particularly the grandmother who is prone to drunken scatological exclamations had me laughing my head off. It was quite unexpected.Although many of the situations could come off as contrived they were secondary to the excellent repartee between Wilson and Vaughn. Their comic pairing worked to a T.R.";

In Wedding Crashers John Beckwith Wilson and Jeremy Klein Vaughn are a pair of divorce mediators whose passion in life is sneaking into weddings to take advantage of the free food.. and of course score with girls.They have a strict 'crashers rulebook' which dictates the etiquette of the pickup such as 'never use your real name'.

The fasttalking machinegun delivery of Vaughn is the perfect accompaniment to Wilson's laconic style. Their singleguy banter's often painfully accurate as is the acknowledgement they're both a little too old to be acting so carelessly. There are also some great comic setpieces too notably the divorce meeting the weddings montage the cringeworthy football game and the hunting trip.The supporting cast are also an asset Christopher Walken expertly walks the tightrope of being both broodingly intimidating and likable while Rachel McAdams' 'Claire' has a charming vulnerability and an easytofallin love with quality. Former Home and Away pinup Isla Fisher however is less convincing.I admit Wedding Crashers is far from perfect at time situations seem too contrived the nudity is laughably gratuitous and Claire's evil fiance Sack Bradley Cooper is an almost too heavyhanded device to make Wilson look good.But if you can look past all that and simply accept it for what it is you're left with a very funny film. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey are committed bachelors who enjoy their womanising ways. They specialise in crashing weddings and picking up women for one night stands by taking advantage of their lower defences. Countless scores of women later John is getting tired but the offer of one last big job tempts him back to crash the wedding of Treasury Secretary Cleary's daughter. Things go well until John falls for Claire Cleary while Jeremy finds himself trapped with the frighteningly clingy Gloria as the pair accept an invitation back to the weekend retreat of the Cleary family.This did not appear strong enough to draw me into the cinema on its release but on an transAtlantic flight it looked like being good enough to fill some time  which is actually a pretty fair summary of the film's strengths and weaknesses. I say this because it is funny enough to cover the problems that it has and thus will serve up as an enjoyable experience if you're relaxed enough to let this happen. The strengths lie in the lead two characters  they banter they are lively and they are funny. Funny enough to cover up the fact that they are exploitative and sexual predators and funny enough to mean that the scenes where they are doing their thing are generally enjoyable. Of course it helps that Wilson and Vaughn are both doing their thing as usually and have great chemistry together  good news if you usually like them but if you don't then why bother? The weaknesses come in with the actual story because every time someone has to fall in love with someone else the laughs stop the pace slows and the whole thing takes on a mushy air that doesn't gel that well with the banter scenes. Likewise the plot devices in the second hour tend to feel a little forced where they are just used to provide direction and create a proper ending etc. This doesn't mean it is terrible but it cannot be a good thing when you actively wish the plot would take a backseat in a film. The support cast share the comedy reasonably well McAdams is cool and appealing Fisher is a bit OTT but is funny Seymour plays on her sexy image really well while Walken is reliable as ever as Christopher Walken.Overall this is an enjoyable if patchy comedy. It trades on the usual delivery and chemistry between Wilson and Vaughn and the two do well to produce the film's best scenes when they are together. The need for a plot romance and separation does hurt the film a little because it is not as good as the aimless banter but not a massive amount. Not a great comedy then but certainly good enough to please anyone who liked Anchorman Dodgeball and other films of similar styles of humour.".

	schema:headline " Owen Wilson  Vince Vaughn Really Click Well In This One.";
	schema:reviewBody "Wedding Crashers is the latest installment in the new overthetop comedies cut from the same cloth as Old School or Meet The Parents. It will take it's rightful place in history along side these great comedies as it deserves.Business partners John Beckwith Owen Wilson and Jeremy Grey Vince Vaughn are also best friends that go way back. Every year they get together and go on a binge of crashing weddings to take advantage of the romance in the air and ultimately to score with the jealous bridesmaids or any other single woman for that matter. John and Jeremy are very smooth and do a lot of research to get a backstory that explains who they are how they are connected to the families and why they are there. They also have what seems to be at least a hundred rules to ensure the crashing of the wedding goes as planned and of course this could not be possible without the original wedding crasher Chaz Will Ferrell who is not only THE wedding crasher but also an innovator as you will see.This all works very well for them until they decide to crash the wedding of weddings Secretary Cleary's Christopher Walken daughter and her new husbandtobe. John was unable to achieve his goal at the Cleary wedding of establishing a relationship with his other daughter Claire Rachel McAdams who he is also falling in love with. Jeremy too is having his problems after achieving his goal with the Secretary's other daughter Gloria Isla Fisher perhaps a bit too quickly as he finds out it was her first time and she quickly attaches herself.The long story made short both John and Jeremy end up on an extended weekend with the Cleary family and hilarity ensues very much the same way Ben Stiller was put in uncomfortable positions by his fianc's family in Meet The Parents.This was a great comedy in which I have heard compared to There's Something About Mary. I would not place it on such an iconic platform but it was very good and holds it's own along with other great comedies of today. Vaughn and Owen are a great team. Will Ferrell is typical Will Ferrell in his small bit part as Chaz. Christopher Walken's part was too small to really be noticed. Isla Fisher played the psycho firsttimer in such a way that it even scared me.The biggest surprise of this movie for me was Rachel McAdams. I took notice of her in Mean Girls and I believed she would be typecast in such roles for probably her whole career but she proved she could carry a movie as the lead love interest and was very captivating with her gorgeous smile.If you liked the movies mentioned in this review then I highly recommend seeing this one as well. It will not disappoint. 8.510".

	schema:headline " Incredibly Funny";
	schema:reviewBody "John Beckwith Owen Wilson and Jeremy Grey Vince Vaughn are lifelong friends who have made a hobby out of lying to get into wedding receptions where they pick up vulnerable women with even more lies. Their plans to crash the upscale wedding of a highprofile politician Christopher Walken go awry when John falls in love with the politician's daughter Rachel McAdams and the two guys end up spending the weekend with her familywho just happen to be completely nuts! Wedding Crashers is easily the funniest film of 2005. It's constantly hilarious and it's not completely immature. The premise is pretty creative and original. The film is not just filled with cheap jokes and toilet humor. There's actually a pretty mature love story to be found here as well. In all honestly the script isn't that great but the film works really well because of the cast. The actors bring life into their characters and most of them give funny performances. Vince Vaughn is the true star of Wedding Crashers. His over the top performance is very funny. Some people may find him annoying though. Owen Wilson also gives a funny performance. He just wasn't as good as Vince but he holds his own. Together Vaughn and Wilson have great chemistry and really make their scenes with one another really funny.Rachel McAdams is one of the best young actresses working today. She appeared in three movies in 2005 and this one was the best. Her performance is pretty good and it's so easy to love this girl. Christopher Walken does his usual routine and he gives an okay performance. He isn't as funny as everyone else though. Isla Fisher is also another talented young actress. She comes out of no where and gives a very funny performance. Jane Seymour is underused which is too bad because she's pretty funny. Bradley Cooper was okay nothing really special though. Not all of the film is perfect. I think the running time is too long. Long comedies rarely work out and while this one does it could have still been edited. Also the ending is kind of cheesy which is okay but a little unexpected. Will Ferrell makes a cameo and let's just say that it was not needed. It wasn't completely bad but he seemed to be trying way too hard. I really think that he's just an average comedian and nothing really special. One last thing the film is pretty funny yet it doesn't have that great of a repeat value at least for me. In the end Wedding Crashers is worth checking out. Rating 810".

The point we left was when the one kid rolled into bed with Vince Vaughn which was to me the last straw in a long line of cheesy over the top corny scenes that were put into this movie to get the most dimwitted audience members to laugh uncontrollably.I found it funny in the theater we watched it in because one half of the theater didn't laugh once throughout the entire time that we were there yet the people on the right were howling from start to finish. Was the ventilation pumping something into the air on that side of the theater? Looking back it seemed as though this movie was written for its shock value alone. I think the writers of this crapfest basically thought to themselves while writing hmm what is the most outlandish thing we could have happen here and then wammo enter low brow slapstick humour to the extreme.The first twenty minutes or so I felt as though I was watching an extended trailer for the movie. It was like watching a train wreck I just couldn't look away until we finally up and left. Thank God we had coupons because I don't think I would have been able to look myself in the mirror ever again having known I had spent money on watching this movie.Like star wars episodes 12 and 3 this is a movie is at its best in the preview. Why waste 2 hours or so watching the entire movie when you can do it in 2 minutes.".

Most to blame is the implausible screenplay but the hammed up bad acting and impossible premise don't help. Several scenarios simply do not work and the maudlin falling in love pretence that is supposed to make these guys likable drags the film kicking and screaming into one of the lamest conclusions in movie history.The two male leads are about as believable and charming as the skanks they may actually pick up along the way. Fortunately the two female leads turn out to be equally reprehensible in their poor judgement and immorality although I suspect the writer and director failed to notice this. One would marry for kinky sex the other to run away from a violent fiance. What was she doing with that guy anyway? These guys will eventually get what they deserve but I could help feeling the violent fianc was a much better choice.If you are naive enough to accept any unlikely plot device thrown your way hate women fear gay men and believe Washington D.C. should have no minorities then this is the comedy fantasy for you! The film has an odd sense of 50's values that reveals it's point of view to be sexist homophobic ageist and immoral and not in a good way. Add an obnoxious Will Farrell ad lib and you have one of the year's worst films.If you must rent it don't buy. You will feel bad having it around the house.If you like a sexy comedy fantasy with turn of the century attitudes see THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN and stop encouraging hacks who make really bad movies like this one.WEDDING CRASHERS is a hateful sad little pimple of a movie that made too much money in the summer of 2005 due to a sudden talent vacuum.".

They really are the perfect comedic duo. Wilson's confidence and heart of gold combined with Vaughn's supremely charismatic hate of the world. All of the performances in the film are golden. Rachel McAdams is so sweet and adorable that you feel like she's the girl next door that you've been in love with your entire life. Christopher Walken is an actor with such warmth and charisma that it's impossible not to love him. The real highlight of the film though is Isla Fisher. She is so natural and convincing in one of the most difficult roles of all time that is scares the hell out of me. I'm scared to ever meet her because of how convincing she was. Will Ferrell delivered arguably the greatest cameo of all time. Even Bradley Cooper was brilliant as the chauvinistic over the top jackass who is stealing the adorable perfect girl. I really love everything about this film. I die in laughter from start to finish every time I see it. It's so quotable as well. My only real complaint is that it's pretty onedimensional but that can be forgotten with how perfect of a comedy it is. Vince Vaughn is really a comic genius. His style of striking smooth quickpaced charismatic cynicism is more brilliant than any comedic style I've ever seen. He really is nothing short of a miracle to comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wedding Crashers one of the top comedies of 2005 is a great comedy because it will appeal to so many different kinds of people. The teenagers are going to love it it's too much for kids under 14 adults will have a blast and everyone in between will have some good laughs to remember. Starring comedic powerhouses Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn Wedding Crashers is a sure bet if you're looking for a fun time.John Wilson and Jeremy Vaughn are divorce counselors whose hobby is crashing weddings. Yes it's really ironic. The dynamic duo have every part of the crash planned from the get go. Slap on a new name a reasonable backstory and a big smile and they're ready to go eat drink and mingle with the women at each ceremony. The only thing they aren't prepared for is one of them falling hard for a bridesmaid Rachel McAdams who is the daughter of the Secretary of State Christopher Walken.The acting is extremely good and when you've got the comedic talents of Wilson Vaughn and Walken it's hard not to be good. Although Wilson and Vaughn play the same characters we're used to over and over they're at their best here. Wilson's typical slacker always has a sweet side and here is no different. He and McAdams have nice chemistry despite the fact that he's far from her in age. Vaughn's quick thinking and sarcastic Jeremy is probably one of the best comedic performances of recent memory and in 2005 it's second to only Steve Carell in The 40 Year Old Virgin. His interactions with Walken's son and other daughter played by Isla Fisher are off the wall hilarious. Fisher plays a crazy character that can get annoying sometimes but will make you wideeyed at how insane she is. Fisher does a great job of making moments that sound cute and funny sound almost scary in a funny way. Rachel McAdams is at her best here as her character is extremely likable as she always is except for Mean Girls of course. McAdams has a subtle trait in her that makes her so special as an actress the way she can catch the audience. It's a rare quality that few actresses possess.The humor is everywhere from simply brainless to clever and witty. Some jokes are complex while some are potty jokes. Vaughn does his thing with the angry and impatient jokes as well as the sarcasm. Wilson's humor is mostly slapstick and simple but he does it very well. Walken brings intensity and humor together and meshes them perfectly for a good performance. Wedding Crashers is a must see for fans of any of the actors but I think everyone will come away from it laughing at least a few times even if they don't like it. It's a memorable experience that you shouldn't take for granted. Take it from me it's a wonderful movie.910 spy".

The first half was hysterical and funny. The second half was not funny at all. Take Will Ferrel for example. They did nothing with him what so ever. They just expected him to be crashing funerals funny. Because it's Will Ferrel and because he crashes funerals they expected it to be funny but it's not. Ever since the clichd love story started is when it went down hill. I mean we've seen it all before. It's the same love story as Meet The Parents Meet The Fockers The NoteBook 13 Going 30 Monster In Law Titanic The Wedding Singer The Wedding Planner When Harry Met Sally and much more. But apart from a terrible second half and yes Will Ferrel is part of the second half the first half was great and hilarious. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves Owen Wilson Vince Vaughn Christopher Walken Rachel Mcadams and introducing Isla Fisher. 710".

It was about 2 guys who attend weddings for free food and to meet girls. I felt like I knew the characters and that means that the writers and directors and actors them self did a good job getting the personality of the characters out. I was however disappointed in the fact that the ending was very sudden and seemed untimely if you will and I think must will agree with that statement.

	schema:reviewBody "One of the things movie audiences have to look forward to every summer is not only the release of several subpar action movies but also the inevitable arrival of the next frat pack comedy. As this summer's past installment of the latter everyone must have had a general impression of what to expect from Wedding Crashers  a simple storyline which is basically only an excuse to showcase the comedic leads and give plenty of opportunity for improvised oneliners and other such laughs. Wedding Crashers indeed lives up to the long loved frat pack formula but still manages to take audiences by surprise in many aspects. It certainly pushes boundaries in terms of sexual content for humor but fear not the jokes are never in such bad taste that they fall into the realm of grossout humor  the movie is far too funny for that. And surely enough the key to the film's success lies in its two leads Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn seem to be a comedic match that was always meant to be with the effortless ease and skill they play off each other managing to evoke a laugh from the most mundane of situations. Between Wilson's laid back easy going persona and Vaughn's manic fast talking improvisational skills every second the two are on screen they never come across as less than superbly entertaining. Unfortunately director David Dobkin and other filmmakers are not content to make a movie revolving simply around the pair of them doing their thing  they find it necessary to convert the story into more of a clichd romance near the end. Not only is this approach far overdone and not that enjoyable at all but it completely clashes with the jovial mood of the first section. It was a good attempt at a more profound storyline but ultimately the film would have been more entertaining had it taken itself a bit more lightly and simply given Vaughn and Wilson more time to wreak havoc playing off each other. As such it is still a highly entertaining film but mainly worth watching for the first half or so. Although the focus is clearly on the two lead characters here they are backed up by an excellent supporting cast as well especially the beautiful and very talented Rachel McAdams as the object of Wilson's affections and Isla Fisher as Vaughn's psychotic and overly clingy girlfriend. Jane Seymour also raises many a laugh often uncomfortable ones given as the mother of the two of them and Christopher Walken... well what can be said about Christopher Walken really? Suffice to say he is beyond excellent as usual raising tears of laughter from doing virtually nothing at all. As much as I may have never expected to say this Wedding Crashers would have been much more entertaining had it made an attempt to stick closer to the frat pack formula instead of trying to work a more serious romance element in which clashed uncomfortably with the carefree uplifting mood of its first half which was much more enjoyable. Still Wedding Crashers is nonetheless one of the very funniest movies released in a long while and worth seeing if only for Vaughn and Wilson's unparalleled chemistry and amazing ability to play off each other. Expect to partake in many a laugh however crude or filthy when watching Wedding Crashers!8.510".

In Wedding Crashers Vaughan plays Jeremy Grey a wisecracking serial wedding crasher intent on picking up as many girls as possible. He is joined by his best friend John Beckwith Owen Wilson. Together the two wreak havoc on the weddings of total strangers as they sleep with a bevy of beautiful women. When our two conniving heroes crash the town's biggest wedding things start to go awry. Beckwith becomes immediately smitten with Claire Cleary played with ease by Rachel McAdams. To make matters worse Claire is the daughter of Treasury Secretary William Cleary a brilliant Christopher Walken. Meanwhile at the same wedding Grey meets Gloria Cleary played by Aussie starlet Isla Fisher. While she seems nice enough Grey quickly discovers she is not what he expected. The rest of the movie follows the two leads as they weasel their way into the Cleary family circle all the while trying to win the hearts of their respective crushes. While the movie and subsequently the laughs fall away slightly near the end there is no doubt this movie will become a cult classic over time. There's even an unnecessary terrible cameo from Will Ferrell hey I love the guy but he is useless in this. Vaughan is clearly having a ball in this while Wilson does a great job of playing the foil.

	schema:reviewBody "Wedding Crashers is a fun comedy that works simply because the filmmakers know what to do with what they've got. The great humor of Wedding Crashers is not found in the cleverness of its script or the creativity of its story but rather in its lead actors. Had anyone but Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn been the leads this movie would have tanked. They are both famous for that congenial charisma that so many people find humorous  the type that makes them come off as the fun buddies that we all wish we could call up on a Friday night. Director David Dobkin must know this because he gives Wilson and Vaughn plenty of scenes to show off the qualities that have made them two of America's funniest and most likable stars. To fulfill the perfect cast Rachel McAdams and Christopher Walken fill in the necessary roles. McAdams again reminds us why she has become so popular in the past year glowing with her vibrant smile and charm that interact perfectly with every character on screen especially Wilson's. Christopher Walken among his many extraordinary traits is famous for his dry sarcastic sense of humor  revealed through his one of a kind voice. He gets a chance not only to earn some laughs in a way that only he can do but also to play the role of the amiable father figure with the great advice. Make no mistake though  underneath this film's main selling point of a couple of funny guys going around and crashing weddings to sleep with girls an idea that is just about concluded within the first 15 minutes  is a sappy conventional chick flick. I use that term carefully though because Wedding Crashers never actually falls victim to the typical stereotypes of your average chick flick. It avoids them because of its great cast and the chemistry they all share on screen  which can appeal to just about anyone who enjoys a good laugh. It conceals the fact that the script is probably one of the worst excuses for a comedy within the past year. What's great is that we never have to look that far  because the characters all seem to be enjoying themselves too much and they make the film just as enjoyable to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "I tell my students to call it as they see it. If someone would be crushed by a scathing review so be it. These Hollywood hotshots' need to get the hint that the public expectations for a true representation of a bestselling novel are more important that their artistic vision. And when I say artistic vision I mean stupidity and downright ignorance. Paolini's Eragon did not sell the way it did because it was merely some pulp fiction about a dragon rather it sold because it has a strong storyline compelling characters and timeless message. Not to mention that it was written by a 16 yearold boy.The most egregious evils lay within the following three reasons. First as it is the entire film is told as exposition. Perhaps this was done purposefully after all this is the first installment of a trilogy. However it should be a complete story regardless. The writer tells the viewer what is going on rather than showing the viewer what is supposed to happen. It's like writing a paragraph with only statements and leaving out the 35 sentences of elaboration for each. It is the worst kind of highlight paper. Truly by the end of the film you are only waiting for the story to begin. But honestly by the end of the movie you just want to be put out of your misery. Second the characters are static and boring. The viewer gets no sense of emotional depth to any of the characters. By limiting the character development the trilogy itself is severely limited. By the time the film reached the final battle scene instead of empathizing with the characters I laughed at them. The music told me that I should feel excitement frustration and even sadness but all I could do was laugh. The laughter was uncomfortable and verging on hysteria I was deeply wounded by this film but it was laughter nonetheless. For example when Eragon wakes after the final battle is won he looks upon Murtagh's friendly and sympathetic countenance. Eragon asks if Saphira is all right and Murtagh replies Some friends can never be replaced Leading the viewer to think that Saphira may be dead. Eragon is clearly distraught and at this point as a viewer you should be crying. But in a whirlwind Saphira appears and Murtagh happily proclaims something like But luckily they don't have to! And at that point I started laughing. A loud raucous laugh came out of me and I had no control over it. I thought Gee that Murtagh! He sure is a practical joker he almost had me there! Because you know that's what pals do they pretend that their friend's best friend has died and then they can have a good laugh over it. Ha ha! Yeah right. The viewer has no sense of the camaraderie between these characters because at the end of the film we still don't even really know who they are much less have a sense of their relationship to one another. Third as a result of the previous two reasons the story has no message worth telling. The novel is infused with themes about friendship tolerance caring and justice however each becomes lost in this nightmare that Fangwhoever had wrought. It is the most severe of all sins as this film will be more widely accessible and distribute than the novel itself. For all those who walk out of the theater thinking this movie was good whether or not they have read the novel they are being deceived. They are being deceived into thinking that this garbage is all that this novel is or could be. With The Lord of the Rings Peter Jackson proved that a significant novel with a clearly defined fantasy world can be made with thoughtfulness grace and beauty. Eragon the movie contains none of those ideals. With a poorly written script by Peter Buchman widely known for his work on War Magician and Jurrasic Park 3 Did anyone even see that? and slipshod production values the film falls flat on it's face. All good stories leave the reader with something to think about but this one just left me thinking I paid 9 for this?True the novel is a significant work that should be made into a film. However I can't see how in the universe that has been created by the filmmakers that the full trilogy can be told with any vestige of the original story arc. What this Fangmeier moron has done is a true disservice to Paolini the Inheritance trilogy the fans and general public and most significantly himself. This is his directorial debut and it is a pathetic interpretation. Something amazing could have been done here. But what I saw was a lazy and wretched re working of a story that should have simply been told as it was written. For this as a teacher I must give Stefen What'shisname and his entire production crew an F because his work was offtopic and irrelevant.".

I have read the book and thaughtWhat a great movie this is going to be. Unfortunately I was wrong. First of all I would dare to say that half of the events that happened in the book weren't shown in the movie at allreason Lord of the Rings has less then 400 pages and the movie lasts around 3 hours Eragon has around 500 pages and it lasts around hour and a half. As a result instead of complexed unpredictable fantasy plot you get simple oneway heading fairy tale. Characters that play very significent role in booklike Murtagh Ajihad and Angela are hardly even mentioned in the movie so that it becomes centered on pretty much only 3 charactersEragon Saphira and Brom. Villains and locations lack imagination so they look cheap and ordinary. Choice of actors is in my opinion good except Edward Speleers. There are way too much memorable quotes in the movie so that movie becomes kind of too much theatrical.Everybody from director to actors failed but still I personally bealive that the biggest failure is Peter Buchman screenwriter. Although he had a fantastic material to work on he managed to ruin it and make a pathetic screenplay from a fantastic bestseller. Only bright side of the movie is always topoftheclass John MalkovichKing Galbatorix pretty solid performance by Jeremy Irons Brom but most of all dragon Saphira voice by Rachel Weisz whose vocal abilities are on very desirable level".

Much like Harry Potter's which is a story that I loved I've read each boom about 20 times I got very disappointed. The books were great the movies were awful and are going from bad to worst. About Eragon the only thing I like in this movie was the special effects even though Saphira does look to have feathers in it's wings. After reading such a great story in Eragon's pages I was looking forward to watch this piece of art... now i realized it's nothing more than a piece of crap. Bad acting to much of the initial story cut and way too many invented parts. The only part I really liked was the freshborn Saphira. The movie really nothing to do with Paolini's excellent written and imagined story. Sorry folks but I think the best way to improve is receiving critics and learning from our mistakes. Try to read Lord of the Rings and watch the respective movie and try to get the differences on it...Sam".

There was no character development at all. Eragon is totally downplayed in the beginning and Roran is there and then just gone. Brom was portrayed as a cranky old man instead of the compassionate story teller. I must say though that Saphira's period of growth was clever and Saphira herself was fantastic. But none of the characters had personality. Speaking of the characters' personality it wasn't ALL the screenwriters fault. What was with Ed Speelers? His rendition of Eragon lacked substance. The battles were immensely cut short. SOOOOOOO much was cut out of the book. And for people with children it should be rated PG13 because the battles were pretty graphic and the Ra'zac were really creepy looking. For people who read the book the movie will make you want to kill the screenwriters. Major things were totally screwed up. Brom didn't even die the way he actually did in the book! Arya was conscious pretty much the whole time so there was no oh no she's going to die! suspense there. It was pretty lame. I felt nothing for any of the characters throughout the movie because nothing about the movie made me want to care about them. Did Christopher Paolini sell out when the price was high enough? I don't know but I am shocked that a writer would allow his or her book to be demolished in such a disgraceful and mocking creation as this movie. The graphics were good and the music was too along with the setting and they were the ONLY good things.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie follows nothing of the book's plot line. I think someone read like maybe ten chapters of the Eragon book and decided to make the movie. If they decide to make Eldest The sequel to Eragon it would be nothing like the book because they have changed too many things in this movie to carry the plot correctly. The plot of the movie shares nothing with the book and the characters the ones they actually decided to add share no similarities to the book's idea of them. The storyline used in the movie could have possibly been acceptable if it hadn't had such bad writing. The lines were mediocre and no one other than Brom Eragon and Saphira had ten lines. Murtagh had like eight or nine lines through the whole movie Nasuada and Ajihad had like two or three and Nasuada doesn't say who she is and Hrothgar had maybe one or two lines. They completely rushed the movie too quickly. Unless you read the book you have no idea how Eragon learns to use magic and are left in the dark about most things. The actors did the best job they could with the horrid lines they were given to read. The special effects were great except that Saphira isn't supposed to have feathers. What dragon has feathers? Christopher Paolini says like fifty times in the book that Saphira's wings are a thin membrane. Also that Eragon is fifteen not seventeen. Every problem comes back to the horrid writing. Bottom Line Could have been a great and timeless movie. Not Lord of the Rings worthy.".

One of the most nagging problems with this movie has it was way to short and seemed like it was in fast forward most of the movie. If they would have increased this movie to 2 hours to 2 and a half hours I think it would have been a very good movie hopefully the DVD will have more added in. The acting by Rachel Weisz was fantastic. Jeremy Irons did a very good for his part. But those are two experienced actors that will give good performances regardless. The CG on Saphira was very well done. The main problem with the acting in this movie was Edward Speleers he had no presence in this movie which is a bad thing for the main character. It was all most like he was just there to read his lines and go home. For which I hold the director responsible but it was also one of his first movies. I think Edward would have made a good side character but someone with more experienced should have been casted as Eragon or a director with more proved talent. If you have never read the book and enjoy good CG you will like this movie. Just change the name of the movie to Saphira and it is OK.

Here is a list of even more things wrong with this pathetic Hollywood adaptation of a great novel i.e. every Stephen King novel made into a movie with the exception of The Stand 1. Saphira instantly grows up while flying around.2. Roran was only in the movie for about 5 minutes. He left home as a draft dodger not to work at the blacksmith or whatever to make money to marry Katrina.3. Murtaugh was only in the movie about 5 minutes. He seemed excited about going to meet the Varden when actually he dreaded it in the book.4. Arya was portrayed as human no pointy ears or almond shaped eyes or angled eyebrows. Arya was dark haired in the book but blond in the movie. With all the money they spent making this movie they couldn't afford a box of Clairol for her to dye her hair??? She also seemed to flirt and fawn on Eragon where in the books she avoided him and was very strict about NOT getting involved. she did afterall destroy the magical drawing he made for her. Also she appeared to take great pleasure in the fact that she is an Elven Princess when in the book she kept it a secret until the Queen exposed her in front of her friends.5. Where was Hrothgar? or Orlik? or the rest of the dwarfs??? they weren't even MENTIONED in the movie!!! if not for the dwarfs Eragon and Saphira and even Arya would not have made it out of Trondjheim alive!!! they were entirely too important to the storyline to be so casually omitted from the movie.6. What happened to Eragon and Saphira going to Ellesmera for their training??? how is it Eragon learned 3 or 4 words from Brom then suddenly can start slinging magic like a cafeteria lady slings lumpy mashed potatoes?!!?! And when he fought Durza he never got the debilitating wound on his back. Also Eragon got his sword Zar'roc from Brom in the movie where in the book he took it from Durza after he killed him.There is way too much more to list that is wrong with this movie. Didn't Christopher Paolini read the screenplay BEFORE he signed the contract for this movie deal??? In my opinion he is a sellout and let the prospect of making more money from his story get in the way of preserving it. I will NOT waste another penny of my money on another movie adaptation or book of his. I will find somebody that has a free used copy of the last book of the Trilogy and read it then.".

They should be ashamed of themselves. Let me start with Peter Buchman. The guy is a second rate hack. Look I'm no every day critic but maybe just maybe hiring the guy who crafted Jurassic Park 3 was a really really bad idea. Buchman needs to find a different trade cause he writes like a bullwhore with a shovel up her ass.Next Stephan Fangmeier directed his way into the worst edited movie I have seen in a while. Is it supposed to be Bish in nature? If so bad move if not well it flows like a B movie and for that it sucks. I don't know what ran through these people's minds after they finished editing it perhaps they were just happy to get it done or they had already spent their money but I can only imagine that they were completely drunk or stoned or simply retarded. But let me sum up my points of contention Dialog sucks. It's juvenile and stupid and the dragon's lines what she says how she sounds when she speaksall terrible and poorly crafted.The editing is amateurish and choppy.The acting is pathetic. Not enough Malkovich his character was great. Irons had his moments too and maybe it was just the bad dialog that sunk his character. Edward Speleers ability to get his lines out rivals the talent of Hayden Christiansen in the Star Wars prequels. Overall the acting was second rate.The dragon riding scenes are poor at best. If they wanted to make a first person shooter game thats one thing but as a movie the scenes are nauseating and fake.Overall I recommend this movie to anyone under 10 who likely doesn't know enough to know this movie sucks. Everyone else read the book and don't waste your time with this shotty garbage.".

The movie itself is action filled and well played exept by Joss stone... which was just ridiculousbut something is missing. I think the directors made a bad choice to exclude some of the I think important factors in the book. Eragon's training the Kull Brom's death the Dwarfs Which were almost nonexistent except for Hrothgar.... who was as tall as a human and lastly the fight in Farthen Dr. I had hoped for a more epic battlefieldly kind of battle instead of the cramped scenes that were made. I had also hoped for a more intense fight between Brom and the Ra'zac and Eragon and Durza in the heart of Farthen Dr. I can only hope that the Ra'zac will have the role in Eldest that they do in the book. Regarless the movie was good the effects were beautiful I admit I had feared what the Urgals and Saphira would looked like  The film sadly looks like its been kinda rushed and I think they should've taken the time to film at least half an hour more the movie is at about 2 hours. Nonetheless as a fan of Eragon I enjoyed the movie and I think that all fans should go see it if not for the story for the intense action  Have fun!".

All in all the director ruined this movie...I have been waiting for this movie for 2 years. I had great expectations and when I left the theater I felt cheated and disappointed. I expected more from him. The entire movie jumps around and I often wondered how they got from point A to point B. There were people who had not read this book in the audience and in the lobby they were wondering about the characters and the plot. They also felt as if something was missing. The movie was only 104 minutes long...they could have made it longer and resolved some of the storyline problems.The following are plot problems whereby the director changed the story line to fit his needs and these are just a few...if this is poetic license he's not a poet and he doesn't have a license. 1. Roran tells Eragon he is leaving the farm and then tells his father not the other way around and Eragon is extremely unhappy that he is being left on the farm. 2. Eragon discovers Saphira is a female when he is trying to name her...he does not know she is a female until this happens. 3. Eragon names Saphira...she doesn't tell him her name. 4. What happened to Katrina? She wasn't even in the story and she was a major player relative to Roran. 5. What happened to Roran? Where did he go? 6. The director makes it look like Eragon and Arya will be lovers and she wants him to be a Dragon rider not her friendlover forever. Eragon is smitten with her not the other way around. 7. in the final battle Durza wounds Eragon horribly across his back...this was completely left out. 8. The Ergols were not just big fat bad bald men...they were similar to Orcs from LOTR. 9. Eragon doesn't just instinctively know magic...Brom has to teach him this and everything else before he dies. 10. Saphira doesn't just grow from 10 pounds to 1000 pounds in one single flight...thats a crock all by itself.2 thumbs down for this flick.".

The C.G.I work done for Saphira was also well done making her more lifelike than her human costars as well.

	schema:reviewBody "There is certainly something for everyone in this movie. That is something for everyone to absolutely detest. Personally I was struck by the horrid acting in this movie. The main characters all seemed to be warming up for the day of shooting in the shots chosen. They're characters were one dimensional at best and 9 times out of 10 they weren't even remotely believable. The best acting came from a poorly CGIed dragon with the completely unbelievable voice of Rachel Weisz.If the acting doesn't kill you the filmmaking is next on the list. There are so many lens flares and disgustingly nauseating camera movements that you'll be using your popcorn bag as a barf bag. If I saw another Hitchcock dolly and zoom like in Vertigo I would have very seriously considered walking out of the movie. Those camera movements only have meaning if you use them sparingly and intentionally at key moments. This movie very much represented a film student's first work when they are eager to try all the tricks movements and shots they've seen in great movies before.MINOR SPOILER WARNING BELOWAnd lastly if you can see past all of these things you will not miss the fact that the story is a very blatant mixture of Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. It starts with a princess who has stolen something from the evil ruler and now tries to smuggle it to her hidden base. I was looking for R2D2 and C3PO to appear. We also learn that Shades can apparently use force strangle like Darth Vader. And of course there are many Lord of the Ringslike things elves and dwarfs EragonAragorn and AriaArwen etc. Some of the shots were even framed identically to shots from Lord of the Rings. END SPOILERSUnfortunately while this film tries to copy Lord of the Rings and Star Wars it has nowhere near the storyline effects or acting in either of them including Episode I so that's pretty bad. Save the money or use it to go see dancing penguins or James Blond playing poker for two hours. Between a horrible script even worse acting awkward editing shakyatbest camera work a blatant lack of directing cheap CGI and other effects and a pace that drags like a car with both rear tires shot out this movie bombs. You'll spend more time talking about how bad it is than you will in the theater actually watching it.".

I don't think the director even read the book! If you haven't read the book the bad acting corny script horrible cuts between scenes inability to follow the story and the boringness and simplicity of it all most likely will ruin it for you. The only two good things about it were Saphira good acting and the special effects which weren't THAT good even.

Tony plans to force the campers to lose as much weight as they can and he also intends to document the marathon shedding of weight and use it for an infomercial for his slenderizing program. In the eyes of the campers Tony has made Camp Hope a living hell. As Gerry and counselor Pat Finley lead the efforts to overthrow Tony the campers prepare for the Apache Relay against arch rival Camp MVP.

In fact I may have gotten bigger laughs this time around. I do not understand why this film has a 5.1 rating after reminding this movie to my friends they all recalled loving it and everyone I recently watched it with loved it. Ben Stiller's character is hillarious and the rest of the cast is great. Besides Ben Kenan Thompson is the only other actor in this who went on to become somewhat of a star which is suprising because all the kids give great performances. Tom Mcgowan the man who plays Pat seemed to be chosen for the role because Chris Farley passed on it and John Candy died but he gives a great performance.I know it sounds cliche but Heavyweights is truly one of the few movies that people of all ages will love.910".

Considering the similarities it shares with The Mighty Ducks movies such as actors Kenan Thompson and Shaun Weiss I'm almost embarrassed. Regardless there's still plenty to appreciate about Heavyweights 15 years later in spite of its silliness  and it's more than just a joke about the ineptitude of the Buffalo Bills.For one it was written and directed by Judd Apatow who has a majority hold on the comedies of the last decade and for two it marks one of Ben Stiller's first prominent roles as fitness wackjob Tony Perkis who takes over a onceadored fat camp and harasses the kids.Good thing Heavyweights was made then or it may never have surfaced seeing as the age of political correctness and weight sensitivity has befallen us. The film is not cruel at all in its depiction of overweight campers so parents surfing around for slightly older kid films and coming across this one shouldn't be concerned about that factor but there's no doubt that such a concept would be hard to get off the ground especially at Disney in the 21st Century.Cowritten by Apatow and Steven Brill writer of The Mighty Ducks films it was as if the two conspired to plant a seed for a type of humor that kids my age at the time would come to identify as their own as they entered the PG13 and Rrated age. Tony Perkis for example is the spitting character image of Stiller's White Goodman from Dodgeball and yet to me he is just as amusing doing his patented whispery intimidating voice now despite my countless repeated viewings of Dodgeball.There's also a classic overnight camp comedy sense of humor in Heavyweights like the kids getting beat in sports by their rival camp an awkward dance mixer with a normal girls camp and when the kids unload the candy stashes they've snuck in camp into secret compartments  as well as the runofthemill fart jokes. Characters such as Tony's hysterical righthand European man Lars however were way ahead of their time.Heavyweights is pretty immature and excludes girls because fat girls would be too taboo for the '90s. Its typical camp movie plot as well as its overthrowthebadguy story arch   which ruled the '90s  come off as stale. But ignore those distractions and Heavyweights is a funny quotable movie with some classic scenes which is all a kid or someone trying to go back and grab some nostalgia really wants.Steven CVisit my site at httpmoviemusereviews.com".

	schema:reviewBody "It's really too bad that summer camps aren't as prevalent in today's society as they used to be. It was a way for kids to get away for a few months every summer. It was a chance to be on your own away from parents anyway visit a place that you would otherwise never see have what may be the most important experiences of your childhood and make friends that you would truly never forget. Kids just do not get that today. The only way they can really experience the magic of summer camp is in the movies. Unfortunately there are not many movies that really show that experience. Meatballs 1979 with Bill Murray may very well be the best example and Indian Summer 1996 shows how those friendships last when a group of 30 year old former campers reunite at the summer camp of their youth. But here with Heavyweights we have another great if not to realistic portrayal of the summer camp experience. Camp Hope is a camp that caters strictly to fat kids. It's where they go to lose weight and make friends with other kids that may also be considered outcasts back home because of their weight. But in fat camp all kids are equal. At least until the kind owners of the camp The Pushkins are forced to sell the camp to a villainous fitness guru wannabe played with demonic zeal by Ben Stiller. It is in fact a performance Stiller would virtually copy for the movie Dodgeball. He attempts to force the kids to lose weight through shall we say questionable methods in order to create a weight loss infomercial. But the kids rebel take over the camp and have summer their way. There are many classic moments such as the kids downloading their stash of candies and snacks in various hiding places Ben Stiller's interrogation of kids that are actually gaining weight a competition with the jocks from Camp MVP across the lake and many more. There's also scenes showing that the kids can be anything they want if they just apply themselves. Such as a dance with the girls from across the lake. At first everyone just stands around. But when the boys start dancing the girls join in and success is in the air until Stiller shows up to degrade the boys again. Sure this movie is by the numbers but it's a fun ride with great characters beautiful scenery and a villain who couldn't be more over the top. Epitomized by the scene where Stiller somersaults from a second story window hits the floor quietly says to himself Ouch and whips his head into a full villain Nobody's gonna stop me speech. Great family movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a hefty child Gerry's parents decide to send him to a Fat Camp and although initially shocked the camp looks like a lot of fun and starts really well. However only a few days into the camp the longtime owners are forced to sell to fitness freak and wouldbe guru Tony Perkis. Quickly the camp goes from being one of family fun to resembling more of a prison camp with a tight regime and cruel ownership. Gradually as Perkis' mental state deteriorates the group decide to take a stand.With the Disney logo and the afternoon slot on television I was ready for a rather childish tone to the film and I accepted it from the start. The plot is obvious and predictable throughout but really this is like complaining that water is wet what is important that the film is fun for both kids and adults. In some ways it succeeds and the film is pretty enjoyable on a basic level even if it could have been better. The silly tone is quite fun even if it is all aimed at older children 7 11 and not adults I was amused by it even if I didn't really get into it  sharper material and more inventive and witty writing would have greatly improved it but it does what it does just about well enough to be worth watching.The cast reflect the material and is full of broad in all senses characters who are very much cookiecutter in their development and really don't do much more than basic pratfalls and so on  there are no real people here and the performances are average. The kids are all soso and suit the material while the adults pretty much do the same stuff. I had reasonable hopes on the basis of Stiller and some of the cameos. Stiller plays a very toned down character that he would later do much better in Dodgeball he is funny but you can't help feel that his material is a real limiter on what he can do  most of his best stuff is more about his delivery than his material. Stiller snr does his usual stuff but is given far too little time to make an impression while Jeffrey Tambor was a surprise find.Overall a fairly standard film from Disney aimed at the older preteen end of the kiddie market. The standard sense of humour plot formula and material never really inspire and produce a film that is enjoyable enough on its own terms but could have been much better with a bit of effort invention and wit put into the material. The cast are par for the course although the presence of Ben Stiller does help although again he could have been so much better. Average stuff for preteens then but not without some value as amusing filler.".

'Heavyweights' squeezes onto the screen from Steven Brill the writer behind the hit 'Mighty Ducks' franchise who is calling the shots for the first time with this flaccid comedy. 'Heavyweights' boasts a hohum message of learning to accept people for who they are and not what they may look like. And this being a Disney film Brill cowriting here with Judd Apartow The Ben Stiller Show is given the opportunity to bash the audience over the head with it.I accept and support the observations that Brill shares with the audience after all it could work wonders for the selfesteem of those  both old and young  who are sensitive about their shape. I'm sure others would too and with 'Heavyweights' there's a perfect chance to address a problem in our schools a problem that's becoming too widespread and serious to be swept under the carpet.But what does Brill do? Takes this potential and goes in completely the wrong direction slapping a unfunny face onto a very important issue. When Brill isn't messing around with crude toilet humour and lumbering slapstick the crux of most of the gags is mainly poking fun at the fat kids doesn't this happen enough in the classroom? who are insultingly portrayed as mischievous foodobsessed youngsters with a deep abhorrence of any kind of physical activity. There's even one riling scene where one of the youngsters is lured into helping Tony out of a sticky situation with the offer of a chocolate and another where the kids perform a celebratory almost ritualistic nighttime dance around a bonfire as they cover themselves with fatty foods. Then to counterbalance this Brill lazily writes off the visiting kids from the other nonfat summer camps as either mean or dumb whereas the overweight children are the exact opposite  if only real life were that simple!. The wit in Brill's script is foul enough to deter most people from enjoying it but with toughtalking black kids stiffupperlip Brits burly Germans and homophobictinged jokes tacked on virtually noone in the audience will be able to escape the offensive paradoxical inanity of 'Heavyweights'.The only performer to emerge from this nonsense relatively unscathed is Ben Stiller. A television star and exSaturday Night Live cast member making a shot at a film career Stiller's performance as the muscular neurotic Tony Perkis is quite irksome  and unlike the rest of the film in a good way. What a shame then that Brill didn't seem to realise this as Perkis's oftenuproarious descent into insanity is pushed to the backburner of the film far too many times. Also Stiller's character dives so far into caricature along the way that the actor can barely keep the film up on his brawny shoulders. Stiller is an able comedian but this unexpected detour into family film land just doesn't fit particularly in the wake of his cult generationX tribute last February's 'Reality Bites'. 410 ".

Ben Stiller's character was pathetic rather than funny and the obese boys  well they were too selfindulging spoiled and most of them  hm ugly to be appealing in any way. Instead of amusing I found the film dangerous  it promotes stuffing with junk food encourages undisciplined behavior and on top of all  promulgates fat people as cleverer than thin and fit ones while the truth is that junk food and lack of exercise is bad for brain development. Do not waist your time with this crap life is too short watch a better movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Heavy Weights is not a politically correct movie. I first saw this movie as a child on the Disney channel and thought it was hilarious.SPOILERSThe movie is basically about fat boys in a fat camp and their crazy summer with psycho fitness slut Tony Perkis Ben Stiller. Jerry is the leading fat boy. The film starts with him at his last day of school ready to enjoy a lazy summer. After he misses his bus and is almost attacked by a dog he comes home to find his parents are sending him to Fat Camp. Jerry is not pleased and screams at his Dr. Phil looking father Your fatter than I am you go to camp! Jerry ultimately is forced to camp where he meets lovely fellow big boys and realizes camp might not be so bad. They have go carts the Blob and best of all no one picks on you because everyone is the fat kid. He makes many friends right away including a young Keenan Thompson.The movie really pokes fun of the mockery of fat children.1. The fat camps beloved owners played by Ben Stillers real parents have gone bankrupt and now new ownership has emerged in the form of former fat kid turned exercise Nazi Tony Perkis. This movie is where I first heard about Ben Stiller. He is great as the cruel Tony. He loves to embarrass his poor campers. At one point he cancels their lunch and simply tells them over the intercom lunch has been canceled due to lack of hustle...Deal with it.CRUEL.2. The dance. This is another of Tony's sick twisted jokes and is hilarious. The boys have a dance with the girls camp and of course these girls are repulsed by the boys.3. Lars. This guy looks like one of the Gestapo. He is a counselor who has a thing for the camp nurse Julie. He is evil and perhaps his character is a mockery of a German Nazi. Lars is foreign and has an accent and marches around the camp with his Aryan looks blowing his whistle like a deranged fat hating Nazi.4. The baseball game. This is just downright unfair. The camp plays baseball against camp MVP camp MVP is a SPORTS camp....Guess who won the game? 5. Food stealing. There cannot be a movie about fat camp without the stealing of food. Sounds funny and it is...after all no matter how many glandular or hormonal problems a person of generous girth has ultimately the majority just ate and a lot...The boys go crazy when they learn the slop they have to eat and resort to desperate measures.6. Revenge. The boys are abused and downright sick of it. Their ultimate kidnapping of demonic Tony is hilarious. The scene at parents night when the parents see what their child is really going through is very funny! 6. The Apache Relay. The finale. This is where the camp again competes with camp MVP in order to win the Apache Relay.The apache relay is a serious of various obstacles that camp MVP always win..... The ending is really great.This movie certainly makes incredible fun of fat people and not just fat people but boys going through puberty. I found it hilarious than and still find it hilarious now. It may not appeal to anyone who does not like this sort of politically incorrect comedy but for those who enjoy Ben Stiller or an occasional chubby joke may find this movie not only funny but endearing. I would watch this with my brother and sister and we would laugh our heads off but we were always rooting for the fat kids. Tony Perkis was the devil and we found the capture of him clever. Loved this movie.....may not be something for obese sensitive.".

But when the owners of the paradise played by husband and wife Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara sell the camp to psycho fitness fanatic Tony Perkis Ben Stiller at his best life at 'fat camp' becomes pure hell for the boys. Perkis determined to exploit the boys as the posterchildren of success for his ongoing Perkisizer infomercial takes away from the boys everything that made camp great. For a while the great times at 'fat camp' made the boys forget their being singled out as something to laugh at. But when sleazy Tony I'm everybody's friend in front of the camera Perkis goes too far in his sadistic ways to make Perkisizer a financial success the boys and some of the old camp counselors get together for a bit of tasty revenge. Don't forget that it's a Dinsey movie. It may not be as ridiculously sentimental as other family features but there is always a moral to be learned and most often it deals with selfesteem. With the Perkins take over the campers are stigmatized by their new camp counselor and particularly by the neighboring camp Camp MVP. In the course of dealing with Tony they learn to appreciate themselves.Viewers who were young enough to enjoy Mighty Ducks and those family films of the early 90s will recognized many of the young actors in this feature. It is one of Kenan Thompson's from All That early roles and he's often proven quite good in comedy. I would say this is probably the best comedy I've seen Stiller in putting on that deep voice and acting like an insane fitness guru get a load of that hair and those workout outfits. However Thomas Hodges as the uptight Perkisizing camp counelor Larrs is the scene stealer in this movie. I never get tired of the you broke my camera scene during the Perkizing reformation montage. He's my favorite character indeed.It's good laughs all around and one that I never get tired of. Being that Disney never seems to tire of airing it on television it is also likely too that there is ample opportunity to catch it at least as of this writing. So get out there and start Perkisizing!".

When Tony Perkins Ben Stiller buys Camp Hope none of the campers could have known just how bad things would become but frankly I enjoyed watching.This movie which I deem viewable for all ages is the type of lighthearted comedy that I loved in the 90s and still love today. All of the campers are funny in their own way and they have memorable performances. To this day I still hear people shout Watch out for Salami Sam when they jump into a pool. Ben Stiller's performance which unfortunately was pretty much recycled years later in dodgeball was at the time hilarious and unique. One of the most underrated shinning stars of this move is Tom Hodges who plays Lars a counselor at Tony's camp who is from far away. The actingwriting combination along with a bit of 90s nostalgia makes 'Heavy Weights' a great movie to watch.".

Truly a waste of time to watch even to see how bad it is. The only real talent in the movie is Ben Stiller who is cast as the hyperactive camp owner. He spends most of the movie being maligned for trying to improve the health of the campers albeit in a manner that is somewhat abrasive. Of course retribution comes when he is injured in a tiger pit and then tortured by an electrified containment cell an act condoned by the camp nurse and two counselors.

The events are coherent. Something you rarely see in Indian movies is people referring to events that have happened in the beginning of the movie. More often than not the scripts are improvised on the sets and to maintain continuity the dialogues are abstract in nature so that the different parts gel in. To make a movie with cross references to subtle events needs you to have a script very firmly in place.Second good thing about the movie was the experimentation with Visuals. Though at some points I felt that they have just indulged into special effects without the need for it they should use effects only where needed but honestly I was very impressed by the efforts taken to meet quality standards.What has put off many people about the movie is the songs and dance and the unrealistic fights and some silly extremisms. Well the songs really don't have much bearing on the movie. And they have experimented with a very rustic style of entertainment which won't get wasted on everyone. As far as the fights and 'silly extremisms' go I feel they tried to retain the HERO flavour which would really appeal to a large aspect of the masses.The movie has very innovative ideas and also dares to be different  thougt most of that part should be attributed to its South Indian Counterpart.I would say please go and see the movie. Its a nice experience. Appreciate it for its professionalism and technical expertise. Appreciate it for amazing dialogues and great performances by Paresh Rawal and Anil Kapoor both. It is a thought provoking film  something I feel the movie really set out to be. So its purpose is served.".

Screenplay and cinematography is good as well except for the part where I dint like animated serpents. Music Music is good too. Acting Acting from all leads is good as well.Final Verdict Well addressed thriller on being a true social servant. Worth adding to your collection.";

Moreover director Shankar has much conviction in his direction to make the overall product fairly digestible.So we have a journalist Mr. Shivaji Rao Anil Kapoor who in an interview with the CM Amrish Puri is challenged to work as a CM for 24 hours. Accepting the challenge he does everything in those 24 hours from clearing JHOPDI'S to suspending corrupt KHOPDI'S. In the second half by public demand he is elected as the permanent CM  but ironically in this half he spends more time romancing with a village girl Rani Mukherjee.A well written script and a fast pace screenplay successfully grab's the audiences attention. Rehman's music is not much hot this time but the song picturizations do have an artistic visual appeal. Lacks of bucks spent on those huge sunflowers  tall bhuttas fat pumpkins and a thousand matkas  though do not make much sense but are surely different than those usual running around trees or dancing in foreign locations.Some scenes have been very well presented like the conflict between the bus driver and the students the interview with the CM and the assassination of the CM at the end. But the MUDDY MATRIX oriented fight sequence was overdone and could have been avoided. In terms of performance Anil Kapoor is extremely convincing and adds life to the portrayal of his character. Rani is charming. Amrish returns to a sensible negative role. Paresh Rawal lends excellent support.Finally if you think hundreds of movies have been made on corrupt system theme then this one is no new but a good example of old wine in the latest bottle.".

Although I haven't seen the original film Mudhalvan yet I can still say that Director Shankar's film has managed to hit the right notes and that too at the right time.Right from the beginning you realize that a heavily intense drama would follow you till the end. It's true. The best thing is that the producers have left no stone unturned to make this film look at par with mega budget movies. The action scenes are perhaps the best ones ever seen in an Anil Kapoor film. Happy to see good special effects and excellent cinematography.Coming to the story there's no doubt that it's the real 'Nayak' of the film. The story doesn't give you even a chance to blink and whatever happens is true to life. Not even a single scene gives you the feel as if you are watching a wrong Movie. Anil Kapoor is in his original form. Rest others have done their respective parts well.However the only thing that one may not like at all would be the excess number of songs and that too placed at the time when the film gets serious. But since they are pleasant one wouldn't mind watching the songs as well.On the whole if you are a true Cinema lover who can watch the film without thinking how much better it could have been go for Nayak. You will surely love it. This film is a blockbuster indeed!".

	schema:headline " Revolution interruptus in a neuroticoperatic extravaganza.";
	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this egregiously brilliant film by an egregiously talented young director at a private screening for members of the American Federation of Film Societies at the 34th Street East Theatre in Manhattan in 1965. I was overwhelmed by so many things in it and longed to see it again. When it opened commercially I kept going back to see it in the way fans of Star Wars go repeatedly to see what they love. I love it though it often makes me as nervous and unsettled as the character of Gina in the film each time I resee it on video.The movie is very loosely based on Stendhal's The Charterhouse of Parma. Parma is where the film is set where Bertolucci is from in the region of Giuseppe Verdi whose music is heard in the film. At its core is a rather uncomplicated story of a young idealist Fabrizio who realizes his ideas will probably never be realized. He is adored by his neurotic and probably nymphomaniac aunt Gina sent to Parma to visit family by her psychiatrist in Milan where she lives...to have her get away for a while. Adriana Asti gives a dynamic performance that steals the movie from everyone else especially from Fabrizio who seems a boring dullard throughout probably Bertolucci's intention though played convincingly by Franco Barilli.The lyric elements of the movie and its persistent auralvisual poetry are what struck me the most. There is a scene at the start of the movie when Fabrizio finds out his friend has committed suicide through drowning. Fabrizio stands at the swimhole area by some pylons and and watches in dazed iciness as a group of young boys in bathing suits make their way out of the water. Camera dissolves are accompanied by rapturous music of Ennio Morricone one of his best scores and never issued on disc as far as I know. Fabrizio asks a young boy Does it seem right to you?...as if a pubescent kid could answer questions about life's tragedies. On every level I find that scene and those moments stunning.Many point justly to great set pieces in the movie such as the one with the aging landowner Puck now on hard times who is about to lose his heavily mortgaged estates. He begins a lament for the past the true theme of the movie! and just when you think he's said enough for us to understand the scene lurches into a sudden leap expanding and becoming utterly mad and grandiose even haywire as the lament continues and the camera swoops over the soontobelostlands in a helicopter shot and as Morricone provides an operatic counterpoint and propels us all into some unspeakable dimension of regretful melancholia.Operatic the movie is stylistically and in a fabulous scene at the Parma Opera quite literally. At the opening night of Verdi's Macbeth the various strata of Parmesan society are seen at their levels in the theatre the bourgeoisie at the orchestra level the aristocrats in posh side boxes even the communist party members clustered closely in their own upper people's box. The scene suggests the La Fenice opera scene in Visconti's Senso. So much in the film is an homage to other directors Godard Rossellini Hawks all of whom are referred to specifically occasionally by his film buff friend. Fabrizio's closest friend and role model is the gentle leftist teacher Cesare.By the end of the film Gina goes back to Milan Fabrizio loses faith in the party and marries his dull but wellpositioned childhood sweetheart Clelia. No revolution for Fabrizio. He is with his nostalgia for the present condemned to live before the revolution as most of us are who have no appetite for revolution only for living.The final scene has Fabrizio marrying Clelia. It is hard to believe that Bertolucci could top what has preceded it in the movie but he does I think. In it the brief marriage scene is intercut with Cesare reading to his young pupils from the Moby Dick story of Captain Ahab in pursuit of the while whale. As Ahab pursued the impossible the characters of this film pursue the impossible. Gina is at the wedding wrenched jealous crying. In a series of moments which Andrew Sarris referred to as electrifying Gina repeatedly kisses the young adolescent brother of Fabrizio. Over and over. On the face. On the head. Her young nephew. She cannot stop. She is driven by envy by regret. She cries. The harpsichordenriched musical moment of Morricone underscores the Euripidean hysterics. There is a freezeframe. A film masterpiece ends.".

	schema:headline " an imperfect but vital film of poetic ideals in love and politics";
	schema:reviewBody "On occasion while watching Bernardo Bertoulcci's Before the Revolution which I have done about four times within the past year I really felt like I was watching someone with a full love of cinema. Not just of how it can distort our perceptions of reality by how close or far or following the subjects are but that there's a certain purity to it. When a filmmaker has this much bursting out of him at 22 23 years old you're bound to find it coming out much like someone that age still on the brink of life full of ideas and still treated in a couple of minor even unintentional ways as a kid. Bertolucci tapped into the vein of the changing of the guard in European cinema with vitality. Like in poetry the moods and music in the language or here the grammar of film itself tends to move along with the expressions used to make it so personal you know no one else could have done it this way. Even when it might stumble the film almost seems to pick itself back up plunging us right into the gut of its subject matter. At times only Last Tango in Paris Bertolucci's masterpiece came close with its honesty of what's going on in the world for these people.And in truth the film's structure would not work without some level of honesty to the viewer or at the least saying with the random seemingly sometimes mundane set of events 'it's got to be this way at least for this character.' How much of it is based from Bertolucci's life I'm not certain. But his lead character Fabrizio Francesco Barilli in a splendidly conflicted performance is not necessarily a great young future leader of men or something. He's a bourgeois the word is used quite a number of times in the film and filled with ideals about a Marxiststyle revolution perhaps. For the most part though he wanders thinks in quotes and is close to his Aunt Gina Adriana Asti perfect for the part. It is dealing with this relationship that the filmmaker has to find his stride most and he does. It goes from quiet to cute to talkative to confused then to something more risqu passionate. When the character's cross the line one may want to suddenly find some of what proceeds as taboo. It's not the case.What turns Before the Revolution into something not as troubling as the subject matter might appear Bertolucci utilizes a style that corresponds with the scattershot frame of mind in the character's story. The plot is 'linear' but there are times where the sort of Italian frame of romanticism comes into play as well. Because the poetry of the emotions helps make this not as potentially pretentious as some of these scenes could come across it is not without notice that upon once or twice times the subject matter goes into confusing points. The scenes late in the film involving Puck for example become so into the realm of the literary that it goes beyond interesting and into the dangerous realm of the selfindulgent which is understandable given the filmmaker's talents. Though Italian to the bone here and there I almost wondered if at times Truffaut and Godard switching off like hitters in a batting cage were in the back of Bertolucci's mind as he wrote the script or filmed a scene.It doesn't hurt at all of course that two great musicians contribute to the film. One is Ennio Morricone who cowrote the music and performed for the film and though not mentioned on IMDb the great Gato Barbieri is also credited in the music. It's not just them but also the whole backbone of the music in the film. It adds that kick that is in many an Italian romancedrama and also touches of ironic humor of the joyfulness of youth i.e. riding the bike early on and songs used for effectiveness ahead of its time.By also entrusting much of his own vision into the hands and eyes of Aldo Scavarda Bertolucci gets cinematography that makes it apparent how with many of his films his style is apparent in every one. That it starts off so rough yet with delicacy and combining it with a lot to contemplate in terms of what love is what politics mean for the well off and the notso well off and an uneasy feeling of hopelessness. It's one of the more breathtaking visions to come from a director younger than 25 in the postItalian newwave.It's not too much of a wonder then Scorsese lists this as his primary influence to make Who's That Knocking at my Door. 9.510".

He was only 22 when he made it and he must have made it immediately after he finished his first film Grim Reaper. It's obvious that he's a genius from this film. Like I said it's kind of a mess but no more beautiful mess has ever been created in the cinema.The story is difficult to follow at times but it is basically about a young bourgeois man who falls in love with his young aunt.

As it does politics rush into the film confused politics probably representing Bertolucci's own conflicting feelings at this point. The whole film feels very personal.I don't know. I really didn't catch too much of well what's going on. Which sounds bad but there's a good reason for my missing everything Bertolucci's direction is breathtaking. It is a nice cross between French New Wave and the Modernist movement that the Italian filmmakers were going through at the time. Bertolucci throws every single cinematic trick into the film that he can fathom. Everything works though. It's showy to be sure but it's never less than one of the most beautiful things I've ever experienced. It never seems less than amazing. The emotions of the film  and they really hit home even if the story is difficult to follow  are fractured and manic.I need to watch Before the Revolution again. I feel though that even if I find it completely flawed the second time around it could be nothing less than the greatest flawed masterpiece ever produced. 10 years after Before the Revolution Bernardo Bertolucci directed what I consider my third favorite film Last Tango in Paris. By then he had perfected his style. I'll be adding another Bertolucci film to my list of favorites tonight.".

	schema:headline " I think this is the kind of movie you either love or hate";
	schema:reviewBody "I was somewhat reluctant about this film. I felt that I would be disappointed cause The Sheltering Sky by Bertolucci is one of my favorite movies. I though that I could never like another film by him. I was wrong. Above all they are very different films so let's forget one of them.I remember when I first saw Fellini's 8  and realizing that one of the reasons I loved it so much was the camera work and especially what you could call as the relative motion between objects the way the moon always stays in the same place as the trees pass by when you drive at night. Prima della Revoluzione is rich of beautiful camera work. Bertolucci tried it all being so young. There are smooth movements like a ballet and stressful agitated shots.

	onyx:emotionText "I was somewhat reluctant about this film. I felt that I would be disappointed cause The Sheltering Sky by Bertolucci is one of my favorite movies. I though that I could never like another film by him. I was wrong. Above all they are very different films so let's forget one of them.I remember when I first saw Fellini's 8  and realizing that one of the reasons I loved it so much was the camera work and especially what you could call as the relative motion between objects the way the moon always stays in the same place as the trees pass by when you drive at night. Prima della Revoluzione is rich of beautiful camera work. Bertolucci tried it all being so young. There are smooth movements like a ballet and stressful agitated shots. I felt humbled and privileged as I saw this film.

Beautifully shot great use of music and unconventional editing the film is excellent on a filmmaking and craft level although it perhaps borrows too liberally from leading filmmakers of the era especially Godard Antonioni and Resnais. The story of a young bourgeois man trying to come to terms with his tear between his attraction to communism and his desire for an easier life leads him into an incestuous affair with his somewhat older aunt. I found it's themes somewhat muddled alternating between being heavyhandedly spelled out or so obtuse I wasn't sure what a given scene was saying. The acting in particular seems a bit all over the place understated to the point of flatness in one scene and then almost theatrically over the top the next. At the end I felt glad I'd seen the film but it didn't stick with me the way Bertolucci's first film La Commare Secca or his third Partner did. Partner deals with some of the same themes but in a far more playful often comedic way. There was a filmschool sort of pretentiousness and emotional distance in Before the Revolution that kept me from feeling moved or from being led to think deeply about the ideas. That said I am willing to revisit it and see if my reaction changes and certainly I enjoyed Bertolucci's already masterful use of image and sound even if the ends he was using them to were a bit muddled.".

It's even stranger to realize that only 8 years later he directed 'The Last Tango in Paris' where his protagonist already experiences his midlife crises. Back in 1964 Bertolucci's main interest was not story telling but rather to find a new visual language to portray his generation. Heavily influenced by the Nouvelle Vague Godard in particular that he even mentions at some length here Bertolucci is eager to break with as many cinematographic conventions as possible but the imagery he develops in the process is so beautiful that this is a delight to watch from beginning to end. Also it serves as a reminder that there was actually a time when there seemed to be an alternative to capitalism though the revolution is only talked about. The whole thing works like a kaleidoscope or mosaic of the time. At first I had trouble to follow the plot because scenes don't necessarily respond to each other in a cause and effect kinda way but once I realized that an ongoing story is not what this is about I was able to relax and enjoy the scenery even more. And though our heroes suffer from first signs of disillusion back then everything seemed possible whether it was changing our society or changing the aesthetics of cinema. What interesting times.".

It is among other things an astoundingly clearheaded study of a certain kind of haute bourgeois flirtation with communist ideology. As Fabrizio the main character observes For me ideology was simply a vacation. Bertolucci himself a haute bourgeoisie who maintained longtime sympathy for the communist party nicely contrasts Fabrizio with his mentor the poor elementary school teacher Cesare who lives the life of a committed party member. When Fabrizio complains that the masses the party is allegedly fighting for simply want the same empty life enjoyed by the bourgeoisie while he joined the party in the hopes of creating a new man his mentor simply replies that the workers want to better their economic conditions and that is right. There are two scenes involving speeches of dazzling virtuosity one where a once rich landowner says goodbye to the estate that is soon to be taken from him Here life finishes and survival begins and a scene were Fabrizio coins the immortal phrase Nostalgia for the present. Both the black and white photography and the imposing classical score add to the poignancy of this dreamy farewell paean to a nave idealistic sensibility that for some time animated the better hearts of educated middle class Europe and somehow managed to live on in a kind of phantasmagoric existence even after the events of 3945  the film is set in the early 60s. As a coming of age film it cleverly juxtaposes questions of political disenchantment with romantic as in sexual enlightenment again the wise Cesare reproaches Fabrizio for confusing his alleged disappointment with ideology with his inability to face his botched relationship with Gina his first love and his aunt!. Some will find this film rather slow and overly literate. Others will find the key interest of the film lies in its technical virtuosity and its playful references to the work of French Nouvelle Vague auteurs. Both reactions are a sad measure of how far the world Bertolucci so successfully evokes has receded from memory as Bertolucci quotes from Talleyrand in the prologue to the film Those who did not live before the revolution do not know how sweet life can be.".

Here though it meshes perfectly and creates one of the most poignant portraits of a doomed romance that I've ever seen.

	schema:reviewBody "After his dbut The Grim Reaper 1962 the then 22year old Bernardo Bertolucci made this Before the Revolution an often astonishing homage to the ongoing French New Wave movement and a work of almost unbelievable maturity given his age. Set very much after the revolution presumably referring to the Italian unification this is undoubtedly a bleak film looking back on Italy's history with blind fond nostalgia and staring into the abyss of their future. Despite the occasional Marxist monologue the film is in no ways political and instead focuses on very human drama with characters seemingly locked into their social roles and resigned to their fate.The handsome and idealistic Fabrizio Francesco Barilli is destined to marry his childhood sweetheart Clelia Cristina Pariset a beautiful woman teetering on aristocracy. After his friend Agostino Allen Midgette drowns in a possible suicide he falls headlong into a potentially dangerous love affair with his aunt Gina Adriana Asti. Gina is unpredictable highly emotional and possibly borderline mentally ill but she is also attractive seductive and wilful challenging for the sullen Fabrizio. The death of Agostino clearly damages the passionate Fabrizio whose studies of Marxism with his teacher and friend Cesare Morando Morandini had made him outspoken but now finds himself blindly wandering into the bourgeoisie.The film doesn't really have a plot as such but is instead a collection of scenes and interplays that channel Bertolucci's somewhat pessimistic views of Italy in the 1960's. The characters seem locked in the past a past that they weren't alive for and as Fabrizio states full of nostalgia for the present as if every passing moment is somehow being snatched away from them. It's best summarised in what is undoubtedly the standout scene in the movie as they visit Puck Cecrope Barilli a man crippled with so much debt that he is soon to lose his beloved land. While the camera stays calm and graceful throughout the film Puck laments as the camera sweeps into their air over rivers and forests Ennio Morricone's astounding score blaring over the visuals. It's a beautiful moment full of sad longing that reminded me of Sam the Lion's moving monologue in The Last Picture Show 1971  one of favourite moments in cinema.Although this is clearly a wink to Godard and the French New Wave Bertolucci takes a much more controlled approach to the direction. The camera often glides slowly from side to side switching character focus as they talk filmed in crisp blackandwhite. It was this approach that caused Godard to voice his displeasure at Bertolucci after viewing his masterpiece The Conformist 1970 claiming it to be too contrived. But cinema can be anything and everything you want it to be and this makes for beautiful cinema anchored by a powerful performance by Asti who makes any possible taboo regarding her incestuous relationship with her nephew become redundant. This is much more than a simple love story this is a film about a country it's past and present.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

It does make this movie confusing to follow at times since you have no idea what the movie is trying to do or say at times but overall the movie remains still a fascinating one. It's an absorbing movie really that is well made and put together by its at the time 22year old director Bernardo Bertolucci.Directingwise this movie is quite an accomplishment especially when you're also taking into consideration that this was only Bernardo Bertolucci's second movie. The characters the actors and some of the sequences are directed really well. Even when you don't understand or like this movie you'll surely still notice this.Guess you could interstate this movie in different ways. You could take it as a coming of age movie as well as a reverse coming of age movie in which one characters wants progress and change while the other doesn't want anything to change and actually rather go back in time. Change is really the keyword for this movie. It's filled with references to changes while new times get welcomed and old times slowly become a thing of the past.But having said all this the story still doesn't really make a lasting impression with anything. No real questions are asked in it since the movie is more often too busy providing answers to things that never really got questioned in the first place. Some more focus and development of the main plot line and its characters wouldn't had harmed the movie.Not an interesting movie to watch but it can still be a fascinating one at times as weird as this might sound.710 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Also starring Domenico Alpi as Fabrizio's father and Amelia Bordi as Fabrizio's mother. I have to be honest that I only vaguely paid attention to the story within the more serious stuff going on and I found it hard to concentrate on the majority of the film's material and not just because of having to read subtitles I don't think I would watch it again to try and understand it better I know it is not a bad political drama.

This is one of Bernardo Bertolucci's first films and was supposedly a breakthru film for him but I just didn't get it. It probably has something to do with the fact that I'm an American with very little understanding of the Italian Revolution and what it meant for the people who lived there but it also has to do with Bertolucci's lack of any kind background given to the characters. We are greeted with the main character Fabrizio running through the streets with his thoughts being displayed as he runs. He meets up with a friend who he urges to become a member of the Partythe Italian Communist Party and the next thing we know he drowns and we're at his funeral. Here Fabrizio reacquaints himself with Aunt Gina whom he met at another funeral years before and they start a deeper relationship that lasts thru most of the rest of the movie. The only other character of note is a Communist Tutor named Cesaro whom Fabrizio speaks highly of but once we meet him we're not quite sure why. Nothing really happens besides this and noone really does any kind of changing from the beginning to the end and we're left with what appears to be a silly romantic movie in the end.

Films like The Searchers and Vertigo are so much more than what appears on the surface while a film like Performance now feels like a bag of tricks. Bertolucci was only 23 when he made Before the Revolution and he brought to it a young man's brio. If he was mimicking anyone it was the trendsetting mystique of Antonioni and perhaps the Rossellini of Journey to Italy referenced here rather than the old Italian masters like Visconti and De Sica. This was a film that confirmed Bertolucci as an extraordinary new talent full of visual daring and breaking very much with convention.He used Stendhal's The Charterhouse of Parma as a jumping off point to tell the story of Fabrizio a young bourgeois Italian in love with his pretty young aunt and today the film still looks remarkable one can see why such a fuss was made of him. Its faults however are also fairly obvious. The material now seems thin even trite while many of the effects feel dated and very much of their period how shocked were audiences at the idea of incest in 1964? How shocked are we now?.Nevertheless the film remains essential and not just as part of the Bertolucci canon. It's essential if we want to understand the revolution that was sixties cinema. We may no longer think of it as Bertolucci's best film but we can still marvel at how audacious it felt back then while still feeling a little superior in our knowledge that cinema has continued to deepen and to develop in the intervening years.".

	schema:headline " Bertolucci delivers a cinematic triumph and a political tour de force";
	schema:reviewBody "Bernardo Bertolucci was probably the last in the line of great filmmakers from Italian cinema's heyday. The neorealist movement helmed by Rossellini De Sica and Visconti brought Italian cinema into the spotlight in the mid'40s. The next generation who had apprenticed under the neorealists included Fellini Antonioni and Monicelli. Following that Pasolini apprenticed under Fellini and then finally Bertolucci apprenticed under Pasolini. This is all a bit of an oversimplification mind you but that's approximately how we arrive at Bertolucci on the Italian cinematic family tree.Before the Revolution released in 1964 was Bertolucci's second film. His 1962 debut effort La commare secca a.k.a. The Grim Reaper had been a critical success although I'd call it only a good film not a great one. Pasolini's influence is very evident in both films.Bertolucci is clearly a student of cinema. The era of new wave directors who came around in about 1960 and engendered a changing of the guard all across the cinematic landscape were notable for being the first generation of filmmakers to have any significant critical background. Previous generations of filmmakers had no serious consistent means of exploring the cinema of other countries not to mention other generations. These '60s filmmakers however thanks to the likes of Langlois and Bazin were raised on film clubs and therefore exposed to a much wider spectrum of the cinema. As a result this era of filmmaking is the first to be so heavily subject to that allimportant aspect of the cinematic process influence.It's never difficult to identify a director who has an immense love for cinema. Their films are filled with allusions pastiche and references galore and they exhibit all sorts of influences stemming from different cinematic styles. Bertolucci is one such filmmaker and Before the Revolution is one such film. This is most obvious in one scene which features explicit dialogue regarding the political merits of many contemporaneous filmmakers but even aside from that we can detect a vast world of inspirations in this film. Before the Revolution is like an amalgam of Pasolini Godard and a left bank nouvelle vague director like Resnais or Varda. Godard's jump cuts and playful style are present at times. We see compositions that are distinctly reminiscent of Varda's La PointeCourte or Resnais's Hiroshima mon amour similar compositions can also be seen in Antonioni's early '60s work such as L'eclisse as well as in Bergman's Persona and Godard's Une femme marie. Most notably the film shares Pasolini's proclivity for a highly poetic form of cinema. There is poetic narration but like Accattone or Mamma Roma the core of the film's poetry is in its visual style.Visually Before the Revolution is absolutely stunning. It's formally impeccable and the cinematography warrants some analysis. At times it emulates Pasolini's unique pseudorealist technique and at other times it is much more formal featuring very slow smooth graceful poetic camerawork. Some of these latter shots are very much ahead of their time reminding me of the more recent films of Terrence Malick or Sorrentino's The Great Beauty. We can see a good deal of virtuosity in the young Bertolucci here.As for the film's content it's very much a communist film focusing on all the usual topics revolution the bourgeoisie et cetera. The film's protagonist is Fabrizio a young man who has committed himself to the revolution and to breaking free of his bourgeois chains. The film's other two central characters are Cesare Fabrizio's revolutionary mentor and Gina Fabrizio's aunt with whom he begins a love affair. Each character plays their role. Fabrizio is the bourgeoisie Cesare the revolutionary and Gina the troubled soul essentially apolitical because she is too wrapped up in her own existential angst to concern herself with political or revolutionary action. Cesare tries to win Fabrizio over to the revolutionary cause and Fabrizio wants to be won over but is he truly committed? Can a bourgeoisie ever be truly committed to the revolution or will he always bow out before the revolution materializes? Perhaps he has too much to lose to truly act on his ideals when the moment for action finally arrives. This was the core of the conflict between workers and students within the revolutionary movement discussed at length in Godard's A Film Like Any Other. Workers fought the revolution out of necessity but the students could always go home to mommy and daddy as soon as the fire got too hot. As outmoded as they may sound in America today these ideas were central to political cinema for a long time. This issue  the complexities of attempting to break the oppressive bonds of bourgeois society  has been the subject of a great many political films and it is again here. I'd like to think of Before the Revolution as a film about the difficulties of achieving social change the aspects of the human condition that drive individuals to revolt against society and the basic need for comfort and security that ultimately undermines the ideals of those who act out of ideology and not practical necessity. The film can certainly be seen that way and I personally want to think of it in those terms because I am not a political person. I'm more interested in subjective portrayals of one individual's vision of life than I am in the politics of revolution. That being said what Bertolucci intended here was probably not a subjective contemplation of the futility of revolution but rather an objective reflection on the necessity for total revolution  the need to wipe out every trace of bourgeois society in order to achieve any genuine positive social change. Like most great films a lot is left open to interpretation here although maybe less than what appears at first glance if you know the politics of the time. Certainly this is an immensely complex largely underappreciated and truly great film. RATING 9.00 out of 10 stars".

Cesare tries to win Fabrizio over to the revolutionary cause and Fabrizio wants to be won over but is he truly committed? Can a bourgeoisie ever be truly committed to the revolution or will he always bow out before the revolution materializes? Perhaps he has too much to lose to truly act on his ideals when the moment for action finally arrives. This was the core of the conflict between workers and students within the revolutionary movement discussed at length in Godard's A Film Like Any Other. Workers fought the revolution out of necessity but the students could always go home to mommy and daddy as soon as the fire got too hot. As outmoded as they may sound in America today these ideas were central to political cinema for a long time. This issue  the complexities of attempting to break the oppressive bonds of bourgeois society  has been the subject of a great many political films and it is again here. I'd like to think of Before the Revolution as a film about the difficulties of achieving social change the aspects of the human condition that drive individuals to revolt against society and the basic need for comfort and security that ultimately undermines the ideals of those who act out of ideology and not practical necessity. The film can certainly be seen that way and I personally want to think of it in those terms because I am not a political person. I'm more interested in subjective portrayals of one individual's vision of life than I am in the politics of revolution. That being said what Bertolucci intended here was probably not a subjective contemplation of the futility of revolution but rather an objective reflection on the necessity for total revolution  the need to wipe out every trace of bourgeois society in order to achieve any genuine positive social change. Like most great films a lot is left open to interpretation here although maybe less than what appears at first glance if you know the politics of the time. Certainly this is an immensely complex largely underappreciated and truly great film. RATING 9.00 out of 10 stars";

	schema:reviewBody "In this symbolic tale of an old man's journey from emotional isolation to a kind of personal renaissance Ingmar Bergman explores in part his own past and in doing so rewards us all with a tale of redemption and love.Victor Sjostrom then 80 years old stars as Professor Isak Borg whose selfindulgent cynicism has left him isolated from others. Sjostrom whose work goes back to the very beginning of the Swedish cinema in the silent film era both as an actor and as a director gives a brilliant and compelling performance. All the action of the film takes place in a single day with flashbacks and dream sequences to Borg's past as Borg wakes and goes on a journey to receive a Jubilee Doctor degree from the University of Lund. Bergman wrote that the idea for the film came upon him when he asked the question What if I could suddenly walk into my childhood? He then imagined a film about suddenly opening a door emerging in reality then turning a corner and entering another period of one's existence and all the time the past is going on alive.Bibi Andersson plays both the Sara from Borg's childhood the cousin he was to marry and the hitchhiker Sara who with her two companions befriends him with warmth and affection. The key scene is when the ancient Borg in dreamscape comes upon the Sara of his childhood out gathering wild strawberries. Borg looks on unnoticed of course as his brother the young Sigfrid ravishes her with a kiss which she returns passionately and as the wild strawberries fall from her bowl onto her apron staining it red Borg experiences the pain of infidelity and heartbreak once again. Note that in English we speak of losing one's cherry here the strawberries symbolize emotionally much the same thing for Sara. Later on in the film as the redemption comes the present day Sara calls out to Borg that it is he that she really loves always and forever. Borg waves her away from the balcony yet we are greatly moved by her love and we know how touched he is.The two young men accompanying Sara can be seen as reincarnations of the serious and careful Isak Borg and the more carefree and daring Sigfrid. It is as though his life has returned to him as a theater in which the characters resemble those of his past yet we are not clear in realizing whether the resemblance properly belongs in the old man's mind or is a synchronicity of time returned.Memorable is Ingrid Thulin who plays Mariana the wife of Borg's son who accompanies him on the auto trip to Lund. She begins with frank bitterness toward the old man but ends with love for him and again we are emotionally moved at the transformation. What Bergman does so very well in this film is to make us experience forgiveness and the transformation of the human spirit from the negative emotions of jealousy and a cold indifference that is close to hate to the redemption that comes with love and a renewal of the human spirit. In quiet agreement with this but with the edge of realism fully intact is the scene near the end when Borg asks his long time housekeeper and cook if they might not call one another by their first names. She responses that even at her age a woman has her reputation to consider. Such a gentle comeuppance meshes well with and serves as a foil for all that has gone on before on this magical day in an old man's life.See this for Bergman who was just then realizing his genius The Seventh Seal was produced immediately before this film and for Sjostrom who had the rare opportunity to return to film as an actor in a leading role many decades past him prime and made the most of it with a flawless performance his last major performance as he was to die three years later.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Along the way he confronts the lack of success in his human relationships as opposed to the success he has enjoyed professionally. A string of encounters with the past and with iconic people he meets gradually bring the contrast into focus for the viewer.I particularly liked the subtle and intelligent storytelling in this film. He tells us before the credits that he is just a boring pedant. We realize as he comes to realize what this has really meant to him. We slowly receive hints of the emotional truths that frame the man's life. He is confronted by traces of how things could have been different.Important points are hinted at without being saidthe viewer is left to sort them out. For example the couple at the gas station convince us in a short and seemingly banal exchange that the Professor was a great healer whose service to those outside his family was anything but sterile. Yet speaking to his daughterinlaw his smug insistence that a debt must be paid gives us a glimpse at what it must have been like for his son to have been held at emotional bay by bloodless cold rationalism.This film deserves NOT to be remade in order to preserve its artistic integrity. It affirms that film can be an art form that touches the soul as opposed to merely a product to be sold.".

We slowly receive hints of the emotional truths that frame the man's life. He is confronted by traces of how things could have been different.Important points are hinted at without being saidthe viewer is left to sort them out. For example the couple at the gas station convince us in a short and seemingly banal exchange that the Professor was a great healer whose service to those outside his family was anything but sterile. Yet speaking to his daughterinlaw his smug insistence that a debt must be paid gives us a glimpse at what it must have been like for his son to have been held at emotional bay by bloodless cold rationalism.This film deserves NOT to be remade in order to preserve its artistic integrity. It affirms that film can be an art form that touches the soul as opposed to merely a product to be sold.";

But quickly the beautiful black and white photography caught my eye and I was drawn into Isak Borg's story or rather his selfexamination.The progression of the film is fantastic. Early in the film Isak has an apparition within a dream and the small events leading up to it within the dream are quite brilliant. Throughout the rest of the film there are dreams and recollections newly discovered secrets of the past that Isak sees for the first time. As he says in the film Dreams as if I must tell myself something I won't listen to when I'm awake.How Bergman shows us the characters is terrific. It's a like a relaxed puzzle that doesn't emphasize any sort of urgency to figure things out. The story unfolds beautifully as we get a deeper sense of Isak who I assume is an alter ago of Ingmar Bergman at that stage of his life he was thirtynine when the film was released.It pains me to know that the majority of people my age would rather watch an Adam Sandler movie or The Rock than something like this. Hey I liked Big Daddy and I love Nicolas Cage but Wild Strawberries is one of the few films I've seen that could possibly change the way I live my life. I'm always interested in listening to what aged people have to say about their own life because well it can only give me tips about my own and that's what this film does in a way.There is one sequence in the film that is frightening and arty and I don't completely grasp what it means beyond Isak's deterioration and his realization of how people actually feel towards him he's told earlier in the film as well but he seems to accept this verdict more readily but it doesn't take away from the film rather it's an interesting addition to an otherwise satisfying experience. In fact it's probably the most vital part of the movie  Isak may not like it bbut once he gets past it he has the option to develop.I don't know if the film is a masterpiece  it's my introduction to Bergman so once I see Cries and Whispers Fanny and Alexander Persona and The Seventh Seal if I can get through it this time I'll come back to this film with a new perspective or at least see it as a part of Bergman's whole. I do think this is a great film of its type. It's the kind of film that may require viewings every five or so years as a sort of reminder.Pauline Kael once said that she didn't think much of Bergman because she'd done her share of soulwrestling and it wasn't that difficult. The film isn't as challenging as I was expecting it to be in fact it's a walk in the park. It's pleasant and rich and beautiful and the title seems perfect after you've seen the film. It's all about wild strawberries.".

However despite his success in his career he is a failure in his personal relationships. His emotional baggage over the years has prevented him from allowing himself to be close to those he truly loves. This theme mirrors one of the subplots of Through a Glass Darkly where a father is being destroyed inside by his daughter's mental illness but he CANNOT allow himself to show his anguishchoosing instead to hide in his room with his tears. It is interesting that the same man playing Borg's son Gunnar Bjrnstrand plays the father only a few years later in Through a Glass Darkly.Fortunately unlike Through a Glass Darkly there IS evidence that the professor is willing to change his persona as he begins to open up more through the course of the movie. This appears to be assisted through extensive soul searching and dreams the professor has concerning his past and his own mortalityalong with experiences he has during a long drive down the coast of Sweden. Because of this even his extremely strained relationship with his son appears to hold some hope of improvement by the film's end. This hope for change lifts this movie above some Bergman films that only wallow in hopelessness.FYIThe Criterion version of this DVD is nice due to its running commentary as well as the accompanying documentary.

He is old now and faced with his own inadequacy and impotence.Bergman introduces three young people into the drama to introduce life's most important question  that of the existence of God. The old man gives them a ride. One of the young men is thinking about becoming a parson the other argues that God doesn't exist. The old man offers no opinion to the debate. He is silent but it is a loud silence. It's a silence that reveals an amazing dimension of loss  the loss of year upon year of not coming to terms with this allimportant question.In one of the final scenes Bergman masterfully closes in tight on the aged face of Professor Isak Borg played by Victor Sjostrom. In that shot we can see the whole universe in his eyes and all of its cares in the bags beneath them. Only Bergman could have directed that scene  only him. It makes Smultronstallet one of the most important films ever made. That one scene better than any other that I know captures loss' on celluloid for all future generations to witness. If you see it you may find yourself having to look away.The imagery in Smultronstallet is unparalleled except by Bergman's own Sjunde inseglrt Det The Seventh Seal 1957. Look for the handless watch the corpse wagon the sparseness of the first scene the car windows turning to black  ominous signs are everywhere. Notice the clues that point to Bergman's existential philosophy the twins write a song for a deaf man  as futile as Sisyphus' labor! and the redemption themes Izak pierces his hand as he looks into the window or the line A doctor's first duty is to ask for forgiveness.'. Notice also the outright defiance of the divine presence that he has bred into his son I will not be forced to live one day longer than I want to.'.Izak is ready to die but it seems that for him life is more forbidding than death. He is a living corpse dead already in nearly every way. All of these factors conspire to create a masterwork of pure art and one that gets richer with each repeated viewing.The film is also cathartic in the sense that Greek drama was cathartic  a warning to the men of ancient Greece to avoid the tragic flaw that undoes the hero  and may be a fateful knock on the door of your undoing as well. Have we answered the question that Izak has not? If not Izak is us. Look hard  very hard  at Izak. Do you like what you see? To quote a line from the film Is there no mercy?' Don't ask me.'

Isak's maid for some 40 years Agda is very upset with her boss' and good friends decision and decides to stay at home she'll eventually show up at the ceremony feeling that the old man has somehow lost control of his senses. It turns out that the long car trip together with his daughterinlaw Marianne was one of the best decision that he made in his long life Isak is 78 years old. The trip that Isak takes will bring back past memories that he so desperately tried to hide from himself. That past will in effect make him not only a better person but bring back the feeling of humanity that he lost not only for himself over these long and empty years. Not only for Isak but for those close to him whom he more or less also lost contact with. Isakin both his dreams and memories is seen as a man who is unable to show any real feelings for those around and close to him in the fear of either being rejected as well as showing himself to be hurt by their negative responses.This defect in Isak personality has cost him the love of his life Sara when he was a young man who rejected him for his handsome and openly aggressive older brother Sigfried. We also see that Isak's marriage to his wife who had long since passed away Karin was anything but happy with her disgusted with his inability to show her any real feelings and emotions as a husband. Were also shown in one of Isak's dreams that she had an affair with another man Ake Fridell who was anything but passive with her like her husband Isak was some 40 years ago behind his back. That may have possibly resulted in the birth of his only child his son who's also a doctor Evald Marriane's husband.Seeing his 96 yearold mother on his way to Lund we see in her the same human defect that he has in that all of her ten children who with the exception of Isak are now deceased never bothered to visit her in her old age. The only time that they had anything to do with her was when they wanted money from the old lady. This coldness and inability to have any attachment to her children is shown not only in both Isak and his mother but in his son Evald who's so disgusted with life and what it had to offer him like a beautiful and caring wife like Marianne. Evald threatened to walk out on Marianne when after he found out of her being pregnant I guess by him she refused his demand of her getting an abortion.Isak is helped on his long trip to Lund not only by Marianne but a number of people they meet and in some cases give a ride along the way. This included a young girl and two of her friend going on a trip to Italy ironically named Sara a virtual twin of the Sara that he loved and lost as a young man. Later Sara together with Anders and Victor who later as a singing group serenade a surprised and grateful to the point of tears Isak after he received his award. Meeting among others along the way to far flung Lund a bickering couple Mr.  Mrs. Alman who almost had Isak and his passengers killed in a headon car crash. Isak also met a gas station attendant Henrik who was so impressed and grateful by what he did for him and his wife in the past  delivered their first child that he refused to get paid for filling up Isak's gastank.By the time Isak got to Lund and received his lifetime achievement award to the attendance and cheering of the entire town he not only realized all the good that he did as a man of medicine all these years but also all the hurt that he gave to others if unintentional. With the little time that he has left Isak was to pass away three years later at the age of 81 Isak is determined to make up for it.Sweet touching yet simple little film about one man's journey back in time who sees how he missed out on the many wonderful things that life had to offer him by being blind to them.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a film school movie one of the greatest ever made or so say the experts. I was told to read the play The English title is Wild Strawberries in a lit class in college and then we were given the chance to see the film. I watched both showings and it changed my thinking about what makes a good movie. This was in the stone age back in '75. I was a wild boy about campus who's taste for films was more actionadventure western and mysterysuspense. The funny thing about Wild Strawberries is there's a little of all those genre's in it if you understand what a cowboy Bergmann was at this point in his career.This is the story about the latelife introspection of an elderly physician. It really appears on the surface to be about as dull a concept for a film as one could ever want to suffer through. But this is a story about facing reality and reality is rarely dull. The plot moves seamlessly through many phases but much of it involves a road trip through the Swedish countryside.I recently bought a DVD of the 70's cult carchase flick Vanishing Point I hadn't seen it since the drivein in my college years. I also own a Criterion Collection copy of Wild Strawberries and I've watched both recently. I realized that Wild Strawberries is a car chase flick as well. But Bergmann's Isak is not running from war weariness but from a life of nihilism cloaked in the oldworld respectability of a family doctor. The chase is his lifetime of selfcertainty agnosticism and increasing isolation finally catching up to him. He realizes that he has been a walking dead man for much of his life something he partially inherited from his mother. Getting too far into the details may fall into the category of being a spoiler although there is enough complexity in this plot to keep literature classes struggling for an A for a long time note the stage play script is exactly the same as the screenplay script.There are a number of notable scenes in the movie that make this day a turning point in the life of the doctor. The groundbreaking dream sequences in the beginning is Hitchcocklike and terrifyingly surreal or is Hitch being Bergmannesque?. Of great beauty is the reverie scene where Isak relives some of his childhood while making a stop at his families' deserted summer lake house. The dialog scenes between Isak and his daughterinlaw and later with the Almans including another disturbing dream sequence and with the children hitchhiking collegeage kids are all filled with symbols and conversation pointing to Isak's livingdead existence.It's interesting that Bergmann himself at this point in his young career was much like Isak agnostic distant selfabsorbed incapable of intimacy. Yet his conclusion to Wild Strawberries is much more hopeful than what Bergmann's own life has been.The turning point of the movie easy to miss if you're not paying close attention is the lovepromise from the young hitchhiker Sara a moment of incredible sweetness and innocent passion that is a regeneration a salvation experience for Isak. Unlike Bergmann Isak closes his eyes that night with the hope of a life of meaning of love in service not just service for maintaining personal dignity and image. Unlike Bergmann Isak has a hope of seeing God when his death does arrive and has demonstrated a new life has begun. This is Isak's Today his day of repentance of stopping the tortuous task of hardening his heart against the call of life yielding in submission to love mercy and grace.Watch this one several times. Bergmann's troupe of actors are incredible his cinematography is spartan and overwhelmingly effective his location shooting in the beautiful Swedish summer is fascinatingly effective in giving a foreign yet downhome feeling that's almost Mayberry like if that's not too extreme a comparison.This movie shows the dichotomy of living for self versus living for the service of others. Isak thought he lived to serve but discovered that service is only of meaning to the server if it is from the heart. It is ultimately a hopeful picture that we can all learn from if we watch with an open heart. Otherwise we see the wasted tragedy of existential living with no greater good than one's own dead image. Does YOUR watch have any hands?".

	schema:reviewBody "As I look at all the 10 star reviews that others have given this film I wonder if I am being foolhardy in daring to say something to the contrary. I am and have been for many years a Bergman fan. I eagerly saw most of his films as they were released. I love nearly all of them  this one being an exception. Certainly the film is worth seeing  any Bergman film is. But this one is often cited as his best and there I would strongly disagree. It is about an academic and although professor Borg has to face some of his demons he comes out on top in then end. I understand why this film is so popular. Academics see themselves in professor Borg and academics have a lot of influence on what is considered art and what isn't. Borg ends up looking good at the end of the film and academics although they have their faults like anyone else like to think that they are worthy of the respect that their position commands. In many many cases they are  and this is not a diatribe against academics. I just think that Bergman let this character off too easily particularly when you compare the way he treats his other characters in movies like The Hour of the Wolf The Silence Shame and so on. He plumbs the depths of the soul and takes no prisoners. Wild Strawberries starts out that way when the professor flashes back to the key points in his life where he turned away from love life and reality in favor of academic honor. But ultimately Bergman backs down. The professor having seen the errors of a lifetime in a few short hours is shown to be wiser and a better man now as he receives his honorary award. Bergman does not do this in his other films. For me this gives a certain falsity to Wild Strawberries that I don't see in Persona for example. Well everyone will probably disagree with me  this is such an acclaimed film  but sometimes it is valuable to hear a contrarian opinion even when you don't agree with it.".

	schema:headline " A Magnificent Film";
	schema:reviewBody "There are moments in Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries where you become so enthralled by an image that you want to dwell on it until you realize that there are so many such moments that to do so would be to stop at practically every scene in the film. The sheer technical and visual skill that Bergman shows here is unsurprising insofar as we ought to expect this from him but it is dazzling even when it is displayed in a film that on the surface has a rather tame premise. An old man Professor Isak Borg played to perfection by Victor Sjstrm is driving to Lund where he is to be honoured. His son's wife and three spirited young people two men and a woman accompany him. They also pick up an utterly depressed couple along the way only to drop them off when they begin to fight. Interspersed with the present actions are the old man's dreams and flashbacks to his youth.Out of this material Bergman crafts a wonderful and touching film about redemption. There is always a tendency to marvel at how an atheist like Bergman can be so deeply involved with religious issues but many atheists of course are atheists precisely as a result of such deep involvement. I don't know enough about Bergman's views on religion to comment on his attitude towards God and religion beyond the basics. What is important at any rate is that this film is one in which an old man is redeemed from a miserably lonely and empty existence through contact with others. This is a deeply humanistic view of redemption and one which is firmly grounded in reality.The film begins with the professor telling us that he has distanced himself from others because he has shunned human relationships. This has left him feeling empty and alone. The man we see seems nice enough until we learn from his son's wife who speaks frankly to him how this selfimposed exilic state has rendered him selfish and aloof. Through flashbacks and the dream sequences we learn enough about his life to chart his progress when young the girl he loved Sara chose his brother over him. The professor married but the marriage was a bad one his wife cheated on him but it apparently did nothing for him. To her as she states in one of the dream sequences he was  cold as ice. The professor therefore is old lonely and has an empty existence.How does one find oneself out of that miserable situation? There are three means through which the old man is redeemed. Firstly the dream sequences serve to warn him of death which considering that the man is 78 could come any day. The dream sequences also point out to him just how detached he is from other human beings. In a fantastic scene he is given a test which he fails. The point is clear enough he might be a professor and doctor but that is nothing if he does not have an understanding of human beings their emotions and feelings. Secondly the flashbacks serve to remind him of a time when he was connected with others as well as of times when he was disconnected from his wife and others. The beautiful scenes of his childhood are marvelously retold with everyone well dressed in white and the entire family engaging with each other. Only he is absent standing in the dark at the threshold an old man staring at the happy ghosts of the past mingling before him. Lastly the three young people the professor meets especially the wonderful Sonia connect with him on a deeply emotional and innocent level. The girl looks like and has the same name as the Sonia who rejected the professor in favour of his brother when he was young. You can interpret this in any way you like but I think it's obvious that we see here a kind of second chance. In the car the professor asks Sonia which of the two young men she likes the most. She does not answer firmly. At the end of the film as the three bid him goodbye she tells the professor that she loves him the most of all. He brushes it off but once he gets in bed there is a great smile on his face. The smile no doubt is a reaction to the whole day's events but I'm certain that one big reason for his happiness at the end is that Sonia finally chose him after having rejected him so long ago.What is the overall message of this film? As with all great films there is no one right answer. What is certain however is that Bergman gives us a view of the world that is neither wholly pessimistic nor wholly optimistic because it is so painfully real. The characters in this film have been bruised. They are broken and seek a way out of their situation. There is no indication in the film that Bergman suggests that a solution will solve all the problems. Rather any change for the better can only come once we engage with the past. Through an understanding of our past and our self we can add a new sense of our self to what the past given. If we can achieve that through whatever means necessary then we can be redeemed. In fact that understanding of ourselves is itself a kind of redemption. Bergman's world is one in which hope is always possible. It can happen to an unsuspecting 78 year old man and it can happen to us. It is never too late. Every day in our life is a new chance to make something better of ourselves.A".

The girl looks like and has the same name as the Sonia who rejected the professor in favour of his brother when he was young. You can interpret this in any way you like but I think it's obvious that we see here a kind of second chance. In the car the professor asks Sonia which of the two young men she likes the most. She does not answer firmly. At the end of the film as the three bid him goodbye she tells the professor that she loves him the most of all. He brushes it off but once he gets in bed there is a great smile on his face. The smile no doubt is a reaction to the whole day's events but I'm certain that one big reason for his happiness at the end is that Sonia finally chose him after having rejected him so long ago.What is the overall message of this film? As with all great films there is no one right answer. What is certain however is that Bergman gives us a view of the world that is neither wholly pessimistic nor wholly optimistic because it is so painfully real. The characters in this film have been bruised. They are broken and seek a way out of their situation. There is no indication in the film that Bergman suggests that a solution will solve all the problems. Rather any change for the better can only come once we engage with the past. Through an understanding of our past and our self we can add a new sense of our self to what the past given. If we can achieve that through whatever means necessary then we can be redeemed. In fact that understanding of ourselves is itself a kind of redemption. Bergman's world is one in which hope is always possible. It can happen to an unsuspecting 78 year old man and it can happen to us. It is never too late. Every day in our life is a new chance to make something better of ourselves.A";

	schema:reviewBody "Ingmer Bergman's films are usually about what's happening inside the mind of a character rather than in the outside world and Wild Strawberries is a classic of the genre. The story in the conventional sense is almost nonexistent and I have no qualms about spilling whatever there is. In any case it's only my version of the story. A 78year old doctor is to be honored on the 50th anniversary of his graduation from the university. The old man's day is normally filled either recalling his dreams while asleep most of them he is unable to comprehend or daydreaming about the girl he loved in his youth who ditched him to marry his brother. It's no different on the day of coronation when he is traveling to the university accompanied by his daughterinlaw estranged from his son. Significantly he never daydreams about his wife he lived with till her death. Occasionally when she does appear in his dreams he is guiltridden to find himself devoid of any feelings for her other than lust. During the journey his daughterinlaw confides in him that his 38year old son is cold detached selfish and vainly principled  traits she observes in him as well as his 95year old mother they meet on the way. The old man has loaned an undisclosed sum of money to his son and in spite of son desperately needing money and old man having no use for it both father and son insist on returning the money as a matter of principle. Although feeling sorry for his son not enjoying life in his prime just like himself he feels himself absolved of any guilt feelings  it's in the genes  and goes back to daydreaming of the girl he loved but lost. It's a film pleasing to the senses  BW cinematography is exceptionally beautiful the background score is haunting and nostalgic. As a character study of old age it's pioneering. Ingmer Bergman is one of the purists of the cinema who has not compromised the least bit in any of his movies. He along with few others notably Robert Bresson and Werner Herzog has made cinema the art form within 100 years of its origin. Bergman's Wild Strawberries and Seventh Seal are among the gems.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ingmar Bergman's WILD STRAWBERRIES on the Criterion DVD version is nothing short of stunning. Picture sound and English Subtitles have never been as fine as seen here. Having viewed this 1957 film during its first U.S. release in 1959 when I was 21 yearsold it was quite involving to return to it 43 years later. Like the Professor of the story I too often reflect upon choice made along lifes path and wonder what might have been if different choices had been made. Victor Sjostron as Proffesor Isak Borg gives the performance of a lifetime! What a magnificent face this man had! Bergman films can be quite dark and depressing but his THE SEVENTH SEAL and WILD STRAWBERRIES are marvelous thoughtprovoking dramas that lift the spirit. BEWARE There are two other DVD releases one from Asia and one from Brazil  but neither of these have been cleaned up like the Criterion version. The sound for instance  I have seen the dream sequence at the beginning of the film when the Professor walks through empty streets sees handless clocks a carriage carrying a casket with his body  a scene with almost complete silenceBUT prints on 16mm VHS and even Laser Disc all contain a great deal of surface noise. In the Criterion version the silence is almost complete. And the picture is perfection  blacks  whites that sparkle and no film blemishes or dirt a picture that is a wonder to behold. Peter Cowie's Commentary is outstanding and very worth while. The 90 Documentary from Swedish Television INGMAR BERGMAN ON LIFE AND WORK is quite fascinating. Bergman then in his early 80's is very articulate and thoughtful in his discussion. Over the years Bergman has come to the conclusion that when we die we are no more  and he has stated that conclusion gives him great peace. BUT his conversation in this documentary puts a wrinkle in his conclusion. He speaks of his final marriage to a woman for over 20 years and of her passing. He can not believe that SHE does not exist anymore. He often has the feeling that she is near him and that she still influences decisions he makes. He can accept not being for himself but not for her. Bergman is getting closer to the truth then he realizes. . . death is not the end  but only the beginning. When he finally passes from this early life and finds that he still is  I wonder if he'll wish he could change the focus of his later film work. Be that as it may  WILD STRAWBERRIES and THE SEVENTH SEAL are two of the finest films of the last century  in my humble opinion.".

Near the end of the film as Isak Borg lies in bed his son asks him how his heart is meaning his physical health. Being a doctor of considerable talent and having a tradition of being practical and sensible in his work you would expect him to tell his son of his failing health. However after his subsequent journey both physical and spiritual his attentions are now turned toward his emotional and spiritual well being a part of himself he has neglected for many years. He simply replies that his heart is fine and that he is happy and content. In this single moment we understand that Isak has reached a moment of catharsis but it also tells us something about every one of us.

The deceptively simple story introduces you to characters who are not wholly sympathetic yet whom you cannot help but care about.  It shows their lives to be rather drab for the most part yet it also brings out how important the events in their lives are to the characters themselves.The story of old Professor Borg driving across Sweden to attend a ceremony in his honor is complemented by just the right measure of dream sequences and flashbacks to his youth which put the doctor's life into perspective and raise the questions that Bergman wants his viewers to think about.  The youthful memories and the symbols they use often strike an immediate chord whether you can personally relate to them or not.  The dreams are suitably weird without being overblown and they are always pertinent.  All of this is a difficult balance to maintain and Bergman had a masterful restraint that most filmmakers lack especially today.  He trusts his viewers to pay attention and he wants the emphasis to remain on the important themes where it should be and not on cinematic artifice.  Of course Wild Strawberries also benefits enormously from Victor Sjstrm's excellent lead performance with considerable help from the rest of the cast as well.Since it has little action and little pretense but much substance this is the kind of movie that might never be widely popular.  But it is a worthwhile experience that will mean something  not always the same thing  to anyone who gives it the attention that it deserves.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wild StrawberriesWild Strawberries written and directed by Ingmar Bergman is an interesting film in the mere fact that it is difficult to predict the conclusion before film's end. Bergman's use of light and dark scenes to create a sense of the character and atmosphere is wonderfully achieved in this outstanding film of the late 1950s. The opening scene of the movie provides the viewer an excellent synopsis of Dr. Isak Borg's life and family. The scene acquaints the viewer with his son mother house keeper deceased wife and the doctor himself. The first dream by Dr. Borg is dark and puzzling due mainly to its unclear meaning and uncanny nature. The street is deserted and clear. Dr. Borg approaches a clock and looks but it is without hands. He looks at his pocket watch and it is also without hands. The black and white scene is subdued and calm but draws the viewer in all the while guessing what's next. The scene is without music and progresses with the sound of a heart beat that quickens with each step taken as he walks along the desolate boulevard. When Dr. Borg approaches a man the man turns and lacks a face. Shortly after a cartdrawn casket passes and knocks its wheel off after colliding with a lamp post. The casket falls opens and a hand hangs exposed. Dr. Borg approaches the casket preparing to look inside when the hand reaches and clutches his hand. Surprised and frightened he struggles to free the grip and soon recognizes that the face of the man in the casket is his own.The movie was filled with Dr. Borg's puzzling dreams and remembrances of his early life but much of the charm and warmth that is contained throughout the movie is owed to the secondary characters. Dr. Borg's daughterinlaw Marianne is a delight to watch because she can smile like an angle and can be bluntly frank all at the same time. Her stunning classic looks and assured mannerism helps the movie in a great way. Agda has lived with the doctor as his housekeeper for forty years. She and Dr. Borg hysterically argues as if man and wife. She knows the doctor well and understands him like the other people in his life do not. Sara the young girl who wakes the doctor as he lay near the wild strawberries is a joy to watch. She shows the doctor new ways to look at the world by not taking anything too seriously. She takes in all that life has to offer and brings out the joy. Her slight touch to the doctor's face while they drove is one of the warmest scenes in the film and defines her loving character. There are many warm moments in the film and many moments of darkness. The beginning of the film was dark puzzling and melancholy and the end of the film was warm bright and full of life and tenderness. The movie brought to mind Charles Dickens' Scrooge from A Christmas Carol. Although Professor Borg was not nearly as cold and unpleasant as Mr. Scrooge he did however isolate and distance himself from his wife friends and family. His cruelty was hidden by his charm but affected people quite similar to Mr. Scrooge's nasty mannerisms. On several occasions in dreams and reality Dr. Borg had to endure scrutiny from family members about his coldness. While driving to Lund Marianne charmingly reminded him of his lack of warmth love and understanding and how she only knows him as a fatherinlaw. Marianne also lets on to Dr. Borg that his own son hates him words that rang in the doctor's head. The doctor's dreams pointed out to him how he isolated the important parts of life and the people who cared for him. During one of Dr. Borg's dreams he was taken by a teacher to see his dead wife. She was in a grassy field where she was making love to another man. Afterwards she sat there talking to the man about her husband not caring not giving her the attention she needed and how he would dismiss the entire event as his fault but she says he does not mean any of it because he is cold as ice. Dr. Borg also became puzzled by a pocket watch that once belonged to his father. His mother showed him the watch and had wanted to give it to her grandson. The watch was missing the hands just as the one in his dream. Throughout the movie Dr. Borg let more and more of his old ways die and by the end of the day he was beginning to live and be happy. The crabby old coot that emerged at the beginning of the movie softened and begin to see how happy he could be if he allowed himself. The Drive with the good people that Dr. Borg was fortunate to have accompany him allowed him to experience the love and joy of others.".

No more is the future in space a Utopia it is a grimy nasty everyday world where people carry on their sordid business as they ever did. Except there is always a hero a flawed hero as is Connery. A personal crusade a battle almost against the odds but not unbelievably so at all and the true hallmark of a good scifi story That is the story would work just as well anywhere any place any time as it does in space in the future.

	schema:reviewBody "I remember wanting to see this when it came out in '81 on the heels of scifi classics such as 'Star Wars' 'Alien' and 'The Empire Strikes Back'. Of course because of its 'R' rating I could never see it until it came out on video. I found it offered a different take on scifi films as it had no involvement with sinister aliens and the only alien world explored is the Jupiter moon.WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!'Outland' is set on Io one of Jupiter's moons in a mining colony. Marshal W.T. O'Niel Connery is assigned to the moon colony. Shortly after he arrives he discovers that several miners have been committing suicide in bizarre and ugly ways such as walking into zeroatmosphere minus a pressure suit. When he investigates he finds that the dead men have been taking an amphetaminelike drug. According to Dr. Lazarus Frances Sternhagen the drug enables the miners to go for days without sleep and work at extended intervals thereby increasing the mine's productivity. When O'Niel follows the dealers' trail he discovers that it leads to the head of the mining operation. These men have no intention of letting O'Niel stop their dirty work and now the marshal has to watch his back at every turn as a hit contract is put out on his head. O'Niel also finds that his own men are willing to turn on him...END SPOILER ALERTLike someone else mentioned the production design does not show space as a shiny clean environment  space is 'dirty' here. The mining colony looks like a real operation in a similar way to the way the Nostromo appeared in 'Alien'. Jerry Goldsmith's music also sounds much like the low sinister tones of 'Alien' which he had written only 2 years before. While it lacks most of the spectacular effects of the 'Star Wars' trilogy it gives a believable sense of the awesome size of space. The story is not unlike a western set in outer space only that the crime the marshal is trying to stop is drugdealing as opposed to train or stagecoach robbery. Not a bad movie not on the scale of 'Star Wars' or 'Alien' but definitely worth looking into.".

	schema:reviewBody "Both in the Citadel Film Series book The Films of Sean Connery and a quick survey of the user comments here everyone seems to be conceding that Outland is simply High Noon transferred to outer space. It's not really but there are certain plot similarities. Of course there were enough similarities that Fred Zinneman stated that Peter Hyams had ripped off his western classic.For one thing Gary Cooper is a newlywed in High Noon Sean Connery is a married man with a 12 year old son. His wife however wants him to give up the futuristic law enforcement business but it's what he knows and because he's such an independent minded fellow who speaks his mind he gets one garbage assignment after another.Here he's on a mining colony on the Jupiter satellite Io. It's a frontier town not unlike some in the west. But Hadleyburg in High Noon is passed the wild and woolly frontier days and the impending gunfight is not wanted because it will bring those days back. Gary Cooper dealt with ingratitude what Connery is dealing with on Io is systemic corruption.The boss of the place is Peter Boyle the head of mining operations. One of the things he provides are illegal synthetic narcotics which make the men work like mules and increase his productivity. They also eventually fry your brain and you turn paranoid. Connery notices several suspicious deaths have occurred in the past two years after he's had to deal with some miners who've gone haywire. The presence of narcotics is confirmed by station doctor Frances Sternhagen during an autopsy. When Boyle's confronted with this bribery doesn't work so he puts out a contract on Connery. His deputies are all on the pad and the miners won't help either. His one friend in the place is Sternhagen.In fact acting honors in Outland go to Frances Sternhagen as the tough old bird of a doctor who's also in a kind of exile on Io. Outland has good special effects and the mining colony on Io is marvelously created with the use of miniatures much like the Himalayas were in Black Narcissus. But it is better known for a good story and some fine acting by all especially Sternhagen. It's one of Sean Connery's better films and shouldn't be missed by science fiction fans or Sean Connery's many fans.So what if it took a few bites out of High Noon.".

The good are not simply heroic they rather strive to survive and struggle to keep what's left of their personal dignity and values after the school of life.People of the future will possibly wonder why anyone ever liked such a normal lifemovie. The answer is Simply because of the everyday life dignity that people emanate in the movie.Really a great positive movie !".

	schema:headline " Very well crafted and entertaining film with a good Sean Connery";
	schema:reviewBody "In the nearfuture in a space mine set on the Jupiter satellite Io the new Marshall O'Niel Sean Connery discovered a mortal drug trafic. This amphetaminelike drug drives the addicted miners mad and makes them committed suicide. O'Niel encovers the conspiracy involving the director of the mine but becomes the target of hitmen with almost no body helping him. The film is a Science Fiction remake of High Noonle train sifflera trois fois in French. The train is here replaced by a shuttle from a space station and the Far West by the set on a deep space mining outpost Not Deep Space Nine.This a well paced film with a solid acting from Sean Connery. The pursuits especialy the first in the corridors of the space habitat are gripping. The film was made in 1981 when the CGI effects were not as prevalent as today. For exemple scenes where humans are dwarfed by huge metalic structures were executed thanks to a then traditional play of mirrors. I have seen this film at the cinema when it played for the first time in 1981. I have recently watched it again on cable TV and I think it has not aged much. Because it is set on a makeshift sleazy outpost and not a shiny white place as too often in science fiction film it remains realistic enough twenty two years later. The themesa bit overlooked dangerous mind drugs greedy multinational or multiplanet here companies the will and courage of one man against the cowardice of all the others resonate still in our mind nowadays. But make no mistake it not a heavy political film but a good suspense and action film with a science fiction flavour.Despite some scientific oddities like heads exploding and weightlessness in a zero pressure atmosphere where as inside the habitat the gravity is normal by Earth standards the script remains coherent enough. The strong performance of Sean Connery is helped by those of a serious Peter Boyle and a preER Frances Sternhagen. Rent this film on your local video store or watch it on TV it is worth seeing it.".

The plot is believable the acting from the minor characters right up to and including the leads is excellent the dialogue is natural and realistic and intelligible and the special effects have aged well and are quite good as good as today's CGI stuff. But unlike today's sf movies it's not the fx that play the central role here but rather plot character and acting.I can understand some of the comments about some of the movie's science particularly in the way earth gravity suddenly appears inside buildings and the way people's cranial cavities literally expand like balloons when exposed to near zero pressure but none of that is central. I'm pleased when I see real science in movies maybe surprised would be a better term but if I want science I can read a textbook. Anyway this shortfall is more than made up for by having a doctor in the movie named Lazarus  over scientific accuracy I'll take a little humor. Or good dialogue such as when O'Neil having just chased a perp through half the installation finally corners him in a kitchen gets the drop on him and leveling his shotgun at his desperate kitchen knifewielding opponent says to him 'Think it over'.Comparisons have been made to other movies like High Noon and sf classics like Alien and 2001. I'll leave 2001 go at least until I can figure out how that giant fetus got out there in outer space but as to Alien well in my view Outland compares quite well despite Alien's iconic status. Alien conveys all the niceness of a vat of sulfuric acid. What a bunch of dismal characters inhabited that movie. Outland has a different feel to it and portrays more than a few positive human characteristics the interaction between O'Neil and his wife is quite affecting although or maybe because it takes place via a video screen. And as to this being a 'remake' of High Noon set in outer space well it really isn't. In fact there's only one aspect of the plot that is similar the first half of Outland is a whodunit though the device of periodically showing a clock to countdown when the bad guys will arrive is of course an obvious imitation. Someone else said that this movie is actually a 'western' and that's true if you mean a movie with a real hero who stands virtually alone despite the odds on the side of right vs. wrong though he does get a little help especially from one particular rather brave woman. Basically though this is just a very good movie that makes good use of and occasionally even exceeds the limits of its genre. It's got plenty of action and suspense and not a single dead spot. It's worth seeing.".

In this distant future  the police marshal is stationed at the remote mining colony on the Jupiter moon of Io  there happens weird events when miners begin suffering from confuse visions and rare breakdowns  as well surprising outbreaks and spells of insanity .

The security marshal gets no support from the populace when he later finds himself marked for killing and nobody is willing to help him . A team of bounty killers and will arrive in moon base at high noon . A doctor  Dr. Lazarus Frances Sternhagen  ultimately risks death to give him a hand .A particular rendition of High noon set in outer space on a volcanic moon of Jupiter  stars Sean Connery alone versus a planetwide drug ring . In fact  this one is no more or less than a Western in space  replacing Gary Cooper by Sean Connery . This enjoyable SciFi is plenty of suspense as the dreaded noon hour approaches and the protagonist realizes he must stand alone  but asking his base fellows for help  nobody is willing to help him . An agreeable Science Fiction movie full of emotional thrills  action and suspense  though the science is rather poor . It is a highly mysterious thriller  filled with nonstop action  including a spectacular denouement in its final part . The narration is adjusted in real time  from the beginning to arrival of the enemy aircraft  at a final showdown and it is approximately developed in ninety minutes as the many onscreen ticks clocks will check . It might make a catching double feature along with High noon . Connery is perfect as the flawed hero who faces off professional killers . He gives firstrate acting as a tough agent who takes on vicious hired killers  facing alone after being abandoned to his fate by the gutless population . Suppport cast is pretty well  giving brief but decent acting  such as  James B.

Hyams directs the film with excellent vigour and his choice of filters and lighting especially the scene in the prostitues room which is blood red from the emergency lighting gives an instant impression of heat fear and so cool relief from the space shots. It could quite easily be overlooked as just another scifi flick but I think it established much more the benefits of bringing earthrealism to outerspace than any other film in it's day.Probably best to watch it as I did when you are 10 years old!!".

Connery effortlessly carries the picture with his considerable charismatic presence receiving terrific support from Frances Sternhagen as a cranky sarcastic doctor Kila Markham as his fedup longsuffering wife Peter Boyle as the blithely corrupt general manager James B. Sikking as a cynical wisecracking on the take deputy and Steven Berkoff as a crazed miner who flips out. Jerry Goldsmith's beautifully moody and stirring score the firstrate special effects the miniatures in particular are amazing Stephen Goldblatt's rough grainy cinematography and the grungy set design are all likewise uniformly fantastic. Moreover the film earns bonus accolades for neatly avoiding certain tiresome clichs. For example the villains never threaten to either kidnap or murder Connery's wife and son. In addition Sternhagen comes to Connery's aid instead of the other way around. Intelligent engrossing and above all exciting Outland sizes up as one of the best and most shamefully underrated adult science fiction movies made in the early 80's.".

	schema:reviewBody "Often this is regarded as HIGH NOON in space and to a point it is very western flavored not to mention has elements one might could possibly claim as lifted from that classic Zinnemann film. First Connery as the marshal of this mining outpost is the only one with enough integrity to stand up against corruption in the name of general manager Peter Boyle on Io a moon with precious resources near Jupiter. As Cooper was in HIGH NOON Connery will seek help and find none. The only one willing to stick their neck out is a woman. Sternhagen is the woman here as Kelly was in HIGH NOON for Cooper. Sternhagena wonderfully underrated actresshas the best lines in the film and is a joy to watch..the perfect Howard Hawks' archetypeportrays a doctor who tends to everyone who gets hurt and knows how the entire outpost functions. She is there for Connery when no one else will stand up. Connery discovers that Boyle through two drug suppliers has been selling amphetamines to labor workers so that they can pull extra hours in order to break productivity records and make big dollars. Boyle is quite a shady characterhis reputation is so notorious no one on the outpost dares cross him. Those who offer help are executed..such as one officer under Connery who was taking pay from Boyle to look the other way but gained guilt and turned to the right side. This was a warning to Connery just how dangerous Boyle could be. When an attempt to kill Connery fails the marshal discovers where the drugs are hidden and dumps them. Boyle furious at the money he lost because of this sends for bounty hunters to execute Connery. The final twenty or so harrowing minutes shows Connery having to find various ways to escape certain harm as the killers arrive and seek him out. The cat and mouse ensues but Connery will have assistance in Sternhagen. This film doesn't show off fancy effects but instead makes this outpost ugly grimy and very junkmetallic. I felt the film desires to show you a bluecollar future where workers look like people who actually operate oilrigs and work in factories. The film utilizes Connery's abilities especially as he waits out the arrival of those killers his dogged determination to take down corruption his inner loneliness and longing to be back with his family and especially his weariness of doing his job the right way with no one appreciating his efforts.".

After all the workers need to let loose and go crazy once in a while since all the hard work they do millions of kilometres from home. Life isn't easy here in space and even O'Niel's wife decides she can no longer continue living so far away from home and leaves with their son to return to Earth a place which their boy has only read about in books.Depressed from the turn of events O'Niel only strengthens his resolve to do what is right and keep some semblance of justice on the colony. Hence when it occurs to the sheriff that this outer space town suffers from inexplicably high suicide levels he decides to resolve the mystery and will resort to any means necessary to solve this case.Gloomy gritty and surprisingly realistic i.e. heads blowing up after decompression starts off very promisingly acting out as a mystery crime story in outer space with some admirable noire qualities. All this quickly comes to pass as the mystery is solved within the first 30 minutes of the movie and from then on we receive a hackjob script which some illogical action sequences not much logic to them actually taking place poor character motivations and stereotypical plot solutions. In the end you just really feel wanting for much more as the movie never supplies what it promises.Essentially this could have been a classic scifi story but the writers just got it all wrong. But the credits of the movie you really have no idea whether it has or has not ended. It never acts out to anything resembling ending and you finish the story asking yourself So what exactly did this mean for the colony and what was the point of O'Niel staying to participate in a bloodbath? The movie ages nicely and special effects are quite impressive. But with a story like this it won't ever become a classic.".

In the end some hired killers turn up to silence him and he finds that noone on the entire moon wants to help him.The set design is fabulous. This really does look and sound like a working colony in the far reaches of space. Connery is tough and uncompromising in one of his strongest characterisations. But the film doesn't deliver as much as it could have. For a start the final shootout is seriously underdeveloped. The villainous characters don't do much in the film and its hard for the audience to hate them which undermines Connery's quest to bring them to justice. There are also far too many chunks of meaningless dialogue which don't do much to move the film forward. This must go down as a missed opportunity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Outland is a film that has stood the test of time. Though it lacks the CGI and other modern advancements available to more recent films it continues to make for compelling viewing. Much of that is due to Sean Connery who gives a typically great performance. And the skill of director Peter Hyams who also must get his share of the credit. Outland is basically a futuristic version of High Noon and more than lives up to the expectations one might have for such a film.Connery plays a lawman assigned to a distant mining colony on the moon of IO. It's a rough and dingy place filed with smarmy characters and run by a corrupt corporate puppet named Shepherd Peter Boyle. Shepherd points out to Connery in an early scene that the miners on this moon work hard and they also like to play hard. In other words he saying the men who work here are going to give you some trouble but as long as the work is getting done you'd better give them some leeway. Connery can tell from the beginning that Shepherd is a schmuck and he soon learns it's worse on IO than he ever imagined. Shepherd is supplying many of the workers with a dangerous drug that allows them to do a hell of a lot of work but makes them psychotic after a few months. Sounds kind of like the meth problem we have around here! Pretty much all of the cops under Connery are paid to look the other way but Connery makes it his personal mission to stop the flow of this drug into the colony. Needless to say that makes Connery a target from all sides. Notice in one scene where he is chasing a suspect through the colony past hundreds of onlookers and nobody will even so much as try to get in the guy's way to slow him down.Is there anybody besides Connery who wants this problem solved? We as the audience are never really told enough about the Connery character for us to get a true understanding of his motivation. Why faced with such tough odds will he stubbornly not go along with the program? He could probably make a fortune if he was in on it. Is he trying to remain honest for the sake of his wife and child? Perhaps but they leave him fairly early in the film and go back to Earth. Is it because he personally dislikes Shepherd so much? Perhaps. Anyway the action unfolds fairly realistically for a science fiction movie as Connery sets out to clean the place up. There is plenty of violence and a good bit of gore. On more than one occasion we see people exposed to zero gravity exploding in a gooey mess. The location though grimy and industrial is beautifully filmed. A later scene depicting a shuttle landing at the facility is particularly well filmed.Outland is exciting wellacted technically compelling. Connery is as good as ever and the film will be a treat for not only science fiction fans but regular moviegoers as well.9 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

	schema:reviewBody "Eschewing the fantastic likes of scifi such as STAR WARS OUTLAND goes for a grim and gritty approach to man's exploration of the universe  it has a similarly realistic look to it as ALIEN. OUTLAND goes one step further actually seeming more like the prison planet of ALIEN 3 in its depiction of a corrupt and alltooreal world where everybody wants a quiet life nobody's on your side and turning a blind eye is a daily event. Into this world comes Sean Connery in one of his best nonhammy roles as a tough marshal who begins investigating a series of suicides and soon discovers a sinister conspiracy of silence at work.The film is regarded as a remake of HIGH NOON with a few scifi updates for instance the hero awaits his killers who arrive by space shuttle rather than a train. Nevertheless it works very well as a western in outer space as the story is universal and the location doesn't matter so much. Peter Hyams works hard as director creating a convincing atmosphere of menace and really building the suspense well as the film leads up to the climax  this is light years ahead of the rubbish like THE RELIC that he ended up directing in the 1990s. The film also benefits from a spooky outerspacey score by ace composer Jerry Goldsmith.However this film isn't perfect by any means. The pacing is a little too slow and the running time a little too long. Also after the huge build up to the climax it's a bit of a letdown  not action packed by any means. Connery resorts to trickery to take down his foes rather than any facetoface confrontations so it's more of an anticlimax than anything else. The miniature special effects of the space station are very good indeed for the time although the cheesy exploding heads made me laugh rather than wince SCANNERS this ain't. Still with Connery at the top of his game  he's never been so darned likable as he is here  and with great support from Sternhagen Boyle Sikking Berkoff and a nice cameo from P. H. Moriarty  OUTLAND is a good and unusual thriller.".

The pacing is a little too slow and the running time a little too long. Also after the huge build up to the climax it's a bit of a letdown  not action packed by any means. Connery resorts to trickery to take down his foes rather than any facetoface confrontations so it's more of an anticlimax than anything else. The miniature special effects of the space station are very good indeed for the time although the cheesy exploding heads made me laugh rather than wince SCANNERS this ain't. Still with Connery at the top of his game  he's never been so darned likable as he is here  and with great support from Sternhagen Boyle Sikking Berkoff and a nice cameo from P. H. Moriarty  OUTLAND is a good and unusual thriller.";

	schema:headline " Fun movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "Yes it can accurately be described as a Western in disguise as High Noon in space basically but that doesn't mean that it isn't well executed and consistently entertaining. Written directed and photographed by Peter Hyams it stars Sean Connery as commanding a presence as he's ever been as W.T. O'Niel a federal marshal stationed on Io the third moon of Jupiter where a mining operation has been established. O'Niel discovers that the workers are being given a drug which greatly increases their productivity but also eventually drives them insane. He becomes determined to nail the persons responsible for this corruption but comes to discover that he'll be mostly alone in his fight  even after his nemesis has two hired guns sent after him. Outland may be predictable standard stuff script wise but it's also a very good looking film with impressive production design by Philip Harrison and sets all built at Englands' famed Pinewood Studios. Commendably O'Niel despite his Dudley Do Right attitude isn't portrayed as some infallible hero rather it's his tendency to make waves that has gotten him transferred from one depressing environment to another. Still you do root for him all the way and you also come to like Dr. Lazarus winningly played by Frances Sternhagen. She's got plenty of sass and actually comes to O'Niels' aid for the suspenseful finale instead of it being the other way around. Hyams too refrains from trying to create any sort of romantic or sexual tension between the two keeping both characters professional. The backandforth chemistry between Connery and Sternhagen is a delight. Peter Boyle is excellent too as the company manager who only wants to see results. Other pros include James B. Sikking a regular in Hyams's films as the slightly shady Montone Steven Berkoff as the unhinged worker Sagan and John Ratzenberger in a memorable bit as another miner who goes off the deep end. Jerry Goldsmith supplies the atmospheric score and the editing is courtesy of the talented veteran Stuart Baird. All in all this sizes up as solid entertainment moving along nicely towards its final showdown. Any fan of the genre or of Connery should be quite satisfied. Seven out of 10.".

Unfortunately the plot summary on the DVD case was the best part of this production.I can't really comment on the quality of the acting because I think it is impossible for an actor to turn in a good performance when heshe is given nothing to work with. The plot was muddy to begin with there was no clarity as to why Operation Matchbox was so important for the British. The viewer was left in the dark as to what was going on. The rationale of the SS goons did happen to make sense but the characters were so stereotyped as to make them seem like cartoon characters with no believability at all. Finally the motivation for Vollner's character was never make clear. He and his friend Beck just seemed like a couple of refugees out of a Three Stooges movie out to make a score.Have I mentioned the cartoon like aspect to the writing yet? Madsen's character  the American Colonel  was straight out of a comic book. What American military man did the writers have n mind  someone from Hogan's Heroes? This is the first time I have given a 1 rating to a film. But this one was so horrid it deserved it. It also deserved it for being an insult to the intelligence of WWII genre fans. This was a real stinker of a movie. There is no excuse for this sort of amateurism.".

Having seen so many excellent wartimemovies my expectations were at the beginning fairly high. Unfortunately I was left disappointed for The Last Drop is no match for great movies such as The Great Raid or Saving Private Ryan. The film lacks tension and suspense as it shifts from one scene to another as well as professional acting to carry out a good quality performance. I agree with the rest of you who claim the accents being indescribable and improper for everyone seems to speak with his own variety of British accent. That's just weird. To my opinion the whole production of the movie is bad as the storyline loses thread and a viewer is thus left confused and rather disturb. On the other hand putting in real footage makes the film a little bit more plausible and somehow makes up for the weak script reflected in excruciatingly poor dialogue. There is some ribald sense of humor to spice things up yet not enough to bring characters into life. All in all the scriptwriter and the producer of the film provide a viewer with low budget special effects bad scenery and a sort of a mishmash of old jazz and modern rock!! S  soundtrack music. So if you really do want to watch a wartimemovie try to avoid this one and pick the miniseries Band Of brothers or one of the above mentioned movies instead.".

Horrible acting by most of them and Billy Zane must have been reading the 0's on his paycheck rather than the script cause he was the worst. Oddly though his is the first Canadian character in a long time that talks fairly authentically at least for a Midwestern. Only problem is his character is from Ontario so thats like giving a southerner a New York accent. The movie constantly reminds us he is Canadian by him saying Eh nonstop. His character has nothing but one liner jokes I had expected this movie to be a serious war movie ala The Great Raid but it could be confused for a TV movie.This movie started off OK but then decided the Nazis were too evil so turned them into good guys I swear! How sad is it when a war movie loses the courage to paint bad guys and makes them all likable even the greedy fat guy.I suppose the entire cast and crew voted for this 9.110 rating cause no way would anyone vote that after seeing this.".

Nicely paced throughout with the plot revealing itself as the film progresses.Excellent over the top performance from Michael Madsen with a nice swipe at US foreign policy  shooting at anything that moves without knowing why.The locations are good and the occasional use of actual archive footage is a nice touch giving the film an authentic feel.According to Carnaby they are still working on a distribution deal. Based on what I saw this shouldn't be too difficult to get.Go  see it when it comes out.".

Or vampires trying to satisfy their appetite for blood ? Strangely the info button said it was a war film about a British unit sent to retrieve some Nazi gold during the war . Hmmm a sort of British DIRTY DOZEN . Strange title for a film set during the war since it says nothing about the plot . This should have been a warning sign along with the fact that it's a British film that I'd never heard of If the signs were bad the reality was reinforced ten minutes in to the running time . An allied officer is verbally given his mission and cut to the interior of a glider where a bunch of soldiers sit . If you've had zero military experience you'll still notice there's something wrong with the mis en scene . Is it the fact all the characters seem to have 21st century hairstyles perhaps ? Certainly you can't fail to notice that they all seem to have different uniforms with Sgt McMillan wearing either a desert tunic or he's been dipping his clothes in bleach . Wouldn't an elite unit be supplied with the same uniforms and equipment Things suddenly get worse for the characters as they're shot down and things get worse for the audience too as we're shown rather clumsy and fundamental errors in film making . Several characters are killed in a shoot out with the Germans and supposedly we're to feel sympathy for their deaths . The problem is we neither know or care about these characters in order to feel any type of empathy save for the fact they're fighting Nazis . It's also an unlikely elite unit who make operational mistakes like walking through a field in broad daylight when there's trees to provide cover This type of clumsy film making continues throughout the film . All the time the audience are asking the question what the heck's the secret mission about ? The screenplay also tries to disguise its underdeveloped nature by occasionally adding a plot twist such as one near the start of the film where a SS man supposedly shoots a prostitute dead . An important rule of film making and life is when you're in a hole you stop digging All in all THE LAST DROP is an obscure British war film that deserves its obscurity . It reminds me of one of those second world war reenactment groups where a bunch of middle aged salad dodging bank managers dress up at the weekend to show us civies what war is like . Personally I think people should just stick to watching documentaries and reading history books if they want to know about the war".

	schema:headline " Three Fatal Flaws Ruined The Last Drop";
	schema:reviewBody "This film supposedly takes place during the first few days of Operation Market Garden which was one of the biggest Allied assaults of the Second World War. In that attack British and U.S. forces moved north into Occupied Holland both by land and air drop and this tale begins with a small British parachute unit being diverted under orders to a remote location behind German lines. In fact the first ten to twelve minutes of The Last Drop are really well done.Or to be charitable the first eighteen minutes are quite good.And then this supposed tale of British derringdo and their nemesis an S.S. Major appointed by Adolf Hitler to steal priceless Dutch artworks and artifacts comes unhinged. The first flaw in this rickety fictional adventure is that it has three flaws 1. The British detachment is led by a fascinating character a Scottish captain who is killed in the firefight following their crash landing in a glider  off course of course . For the rest of the film the rest of the British soldiers quarrel amongst themselves over who's the real leader.2. The National Socialist S.S. officer is clearly an important character to the plot development but we never learn much about him until almost the very end of the story. This is a serious flaw as it erodes the otherwise natural dramatic tension.3. Three renegade German soldiers  who somehow know about the treasure trove of Dutch artifacts and artworks  are introduced in the crudest possible way i.e. as they interrupt an S.S. bureaucrat while he's in a dalliance with courtesan. Who is really a part of their plot only the S.S. dunderhead is too stupid to figure it out.4. Oooops there's a fourth flaw !! This kind of a film  the caper behind enemy lines movie was done with such superb dramatization and excitement in Kelly's Heroes that any film auteur who wants to take it up again had better get himself or herself the current equivalents of Donald Sutherland Carroll O'Connor Don Rickles and especially a worldweary Clint Eastwood as the central player or leader. This was not done here despite the fact that the budget for this film enabled wonderfully accurate costuming equipment and weapons accurate replication of tactics and lingo and some exciting battle scenes.They had the money to do a great film and they muffed it. For some wholly unknown reason they drafted Michael Madsen for a meaningful cameo role and he gave them less than a cameo's worth of value !! The plot is an intriguing one and based on many known historical facts but the execution directing music and the very ending itself fail miserably. By the real end of this film I was very glad that it was the end of this film. It's not a spy movie but it has espionage elements it's not a buddies at war film but it has buddies at war it's not a cultural and political statement about war but it has cultural and political statements about war. Yikes. What a mess. Unless the reader can get this film on DVD for free .... forget it !!".

I was impressed by the rural setting if this was Romania then it seems an ideal place to make this category of movie the windmill was a added touch and it really did feel like Holland. It was a relief to see some attention had been paid to making the uniforms and other props as realistic to that period as possible. Being a model aircraft enthusiast it was a nice touch to see the Computer Graphics showing the action in the air. Blending the black and white footage into color was an adventurous move which added the feel of going back in time. Thankfully the blood and gore aspects of a war movie were not dwelled upon I reals this is what happens in a war but is it necessary to dwell on this for what is after all entertainment. So I would consider this to be a well thought out and produced film and will be adding this to my War movie collection.".

Being a model aircraft enthusiast it was a nice touch to see the Computer Graphics showing the action in the air. Blending the black and white footage into color was an adventurous move which added the feel of going back in time. Thankfully the blood and gore aspects of a war movie were not dwelled upon I reals this is what happens in a war but is it necessary to dwell on this for what is after all entertainment. So I would consider this to be a well thought out and produced film and will be adding this to my War movie collection.";

The script was well written with spatterings of humor interjected which I feel added to the overall flow of the film. The initial fight scene when the glider landed was excellent and went on for a good few minutes. I also enjoyed when the German Fighter plane was it a Messerschmit?  attacked them some heroism from the medic. I was not disappointed and enjoyed watching this film. Can I recommend it to others? Mmmm depends if you want a nice enjoyable couple of hours then yes. If you want something like Vietnam movie appocalipse now style then no.".

Repeatedly. In case you had dozed off and couldn't tell where the guys were.OK was there anything good in this film? Hmm. Some explosions. Pretty colors.

It deals about two gunfighters  Fred Anthony Steffen and Johnny Mark Damon arriving in a little town that has the ordinary shops and buildings  as General merchandise  Livery stable Hardware  Barber shop  Saloon  Blacksmith  Hotel .. Once in town they find themselves taking on a corrupt Sheriff named Bob Watson Piero Lulli who is working for the local Rich Man named Steve Rogers Luis Induni married to a widow Mary Martin who results to be Mark Harmon's mother.

The powerful man hires the killers Farrell Brothers Raf Baldassarre to face off the protagonist duo . Can the mysterious gunfighters stop the outlaw brothers ? The drifters will take on a couple of brothers and their hoodlums Jose Marco . Meanwhile  Fred is appointed as a new Sheriff and Johnny falls in love with Elizabeth Dianik Zurawoska .Well crafted Western with interesting screenplay  acceptable cinematography and slick production design by the habitual Ral Prez Cbero Cubero and Jos Luis Galicia . Although atmospheric  it is also downbeat and sometimes just downright nasty as when a family is executed and hung. The story is almost rapid and violent as the drifters come to strange frontier town just in time for reckoning bandits . This exciting western contains a story full of violence  good dramatic pace and passable filmmaking . Enjoyable ChorizoSpaghetti Western mostly produced by Spain and Italian secondary participation  it follows the Sergio Leone wake  including closeup  zooms  choreographic duels and no being proceeded in American style . The film packs action  shootouts  drama  high bodycount and it is fast moving and quite entertaining . It is a thrilling western with spectacular outdoors filmed in Almeria  as usual  dealing with a breathtaking confrontation among protagonists  Anthony Steffen and Mark Damon versus heartless Piero Lulli  and both of them against Luis Induni and his underlings . Acceptable action sequences with rousing crossfire and spectacularly bloody shootouts . Charismatic performance for the whole casting . The notorious Spaghetti actor  Anthony Steffen is good in his usual tough role and agreeable performance by Mark Damon in a likable role  furthermore the slimy  menacing outlaw played by Ralf Baldassarre here in his customary role as a bandit and in a cruelly baddie character . There appears as habitual secondaries in SpanishItalian Western such as Luis Induni  Luis Barboo  Barta Barry Miguel Del Castillo  Jesus Guzman who still continues playing  and of course  Carlos Romero Marchent  Joaquin and Rafael Marchent's brother who used to work in their films . The musician Riz Ortalani composes a nice soundtrack  well conducted  this turns out to be one of the most memorable parts of the movie  as it's plenty of enjoyable sounds and haunting musical background and with agreeable leitmotif. The picture is well starred by Anthony SteffenAntonio De Teffe  he began playing secondary roles into typical examples of popular Italian films of the late 50s as sword and sandal epics comedies adventures and was with spaghetti westerns that renamed achieved worldwide stardom. His acting is often accused of being wooden but in many manners is ideally suited to playing the steelyfaced gunslinger synonymous with the genre . His others successes include well liked features as Seven Dollars to Kill The last Mohican Train for Durango Gentleman Jo  Four dollars for Django Shango Arizona colt Apocalypse Joe and several others. He was still enjoyable in other genres specially Giallos as the successful The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave Death in Haiti or The Crimes of the Black Cat a good example of Giallo where he played a blind pianist  one of his roles he most liked  and Killer Fish .The motion picture was professionally directed and in personal style by Rafael Romero Marchent at his best . Rafael is an expert writer and director of Spaghetti Western as he proved in Two crosses on Danger Pass Cry for revenge and Two guns for two twins .

I had no information on this title other than knowing Anthony Steffen stars. Now I have seen numerous Steffen Westerns and have not been particularly impressed with his movies nor his acting. But this movie changed my opinion of him DRAMATICALLY! The story centers on 2 Bounty Hunters Steffen and Mark Damonthat ride into the town of Blackstone after killing an entire gang of wanted men. Once in town they find themselves in the middle of rash of murders and a corrupt Sheriff who is working for the local Rich Man who in turn is trying to control all the land because the railroad is coming through.A few plot twists to keep you guessing and some great acting all the way around provide for an entertaining Spaghetti! This is not your typical revenge theme Spaghetti Western.The chemistry between Steffen and Damon is perfect. I can say with almost certainty that the U.S. television series Alias Smith and Jones drew heavily from this film! I HIGHLY recommend this film to not only fans of Spaghetti Westerns but Western fans in general. The plot is cohesive and interesting the scenes well edited the cinematography excellent and the gunplay is perfect. No overacting here except maybe the maniacal laughing at the end by Steffen...although it's not over the top.A MUSTSEE FOR SPAGHETTI FANS!!!".

The director's speciality is to have his two stars sweep their guns across the screen in sudden ambushes wiping out huge gangs of bad guys in one fell swoop. It's an effect that never gets old and indeed provides much of the fun of the production. Elsewhere plot elements include railroadbuilding a corrupt sheriff and a love story. The film is heavily derivative of the Leone trilogy and the score sounds suspiciously like Morricone throughout but DEAD MEN DON'T COUNT is still solid fun.".

Henry was an intense and harrowing shockdrama partly based on horrible reallife events whereas this crazy flick revolves on naughty aliens banished from their planet and killer headaches! The Borrower is an endurable and occasionally even fun little flick but it lacks a proper script and especially that last half hour lingers on enormously. This lowbudget Bmovie opens with images inside an alien spaceship as it heads for earth to drop off a banished member of their intergalactic community. The opening is pretty funny as the alien refers to human beings as the absolute lowest forms of life and getting sent to earth is actually a punishment far worse than execution. Gee thanks Mr. Alien! We like your planet too. The rest of the film is reminiscent of The Hidden only the alien's modus operandi to switch hosts is a whole lot messier. Whenever the unfriendly visitor runs out of energy or gets damaged he simply rips off the head of any poor person or dog that stands too close and attaches it to his own body. His first victim is a redneck hunter the ultracool Tom Towles of House of 1.000 Corpses and the alien uses his head to go to the big city and run a little amok there. Meanwhile the ambitious female detective Diana Pierce pursues an escaped psychokiller and naturally both story lines will neatly come together in the end. The crazy headtransplant aspect results in some excellent splattersequences and a fair amount of delightful black humor. Also and as some other reviewers already mentioned the film is even mildly effective as a social commentary pointing out all the issues of life in the big city. Too bad about the imbecile and downright crappy ending. It almost seems like McNaughton completely lost interest in finishing the film properly.".

The premise and story are interesting there are both intentionally funny parts and unintentionally funny parts and the music is good especially the theme. Probably the weakest aspect is the acting. Between the title characteran alien who is played by five different actors as he changes identitiesand the two heroes a pair of cops boringly played by Rae Dawn Chong and Dan Gordon we never really have anyone to care about. One aspect of the movie that I found especially pleasantly surprising is its urban setting. Most lowbudget SF or horror bmovies are set in the wilderness or a postapocalypse to cut down on costs while this was set in the big city full of people and streets and buildings and modern technology. Thatand the unexpected crossdressing by BradPittmanqu Neil Giuntoliare what make this movie a keeper!".

	schema:reviewBody "From the guy who brought us the unnervingly realistic and tense 'Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer 1986' comes another genre effort by director John McNaughton but you can call 'The Borrower' somewhat a total change of pace. Its ridiculous premise bathes itself in hysteria cheese and an overpowering metallic soundtrack. A true stepdown but the angle has changed for this lowbudget outing in favour of a black comedy with a less than serious tone and horrifically inyourface FX work. It kind reminded of the similar themed 'The Hidden 1987' which seemed to be a trendsetter for many that followed 'Dark Angel and 'Split Second' shoot to mind involving cops on the trail of a serial killer that may be of extraterrestrial origins.A criminal alien is genetically devolved and vanquished to earth in human form. There he discovers that his head has a habit of exploding forcing him to find another replacement and eventually another one. Police detectives Diana Pierce and her partner Charlie Krieger find themselves on the case of this very demented serial killer who likes to take the heads of the victim but soon they realise there might be more to this case.As it is it's a mildly fun bgrade romp with numerous moments of flamboyantly gooey head explosions and tearing off heads kind of like that in 1979 film 'The Dark' to only borrow them. Strangely when the alien does do that the body changes too even though its only should be the head. Whoops. The idea shows a breath imagination but McNaughton's duplicated handling of it is simply disappointing and never variable enough. Even the social element is weakly penned. Other than those unconventional graphic scenes nothing much tends to happen from its slight structure. It suffers from a languishing last quarter muddled writing with a redundant subplot though it does tie in at the end but why? involving another killer and one of the cops. Even the lighting is so smoky or some sequences are paved in darkness making it hard to work out certain details. While the action when it occurs is frenetic there's nothing beating its systematic feel and where we are left with an incomplete feel due to its copout ending after rattling climax.Rae Dawn Chong emit's an uninterestingly sullen temperament as detective Pierce and a grizzled Don Gordon is fine as detective Krieger. The support fairs up much better with a delightfully amusing Tom Towles and Antonio Fargas steals some scenes.'The Borrower' is moderate entertainment due largely to the makeup FX but ends up being bounded in its bizarre concept and plodding narrative.".

Stranded on Earth the alien is found by two men unfortunately devolution is not a precise science  the aliens human looking head explodes. While looking at the headless body the man Bob Laney Tom Towles gets too close  the alien suddenly comes back to life  replaces his own missing head with the rippedoff head of Laney. As the alien walks around the city  sees human society his head keeps exploding which it needs to replace with the nearest bonce it can find human or animal will do. The news of a serial killer who decapitates his victims quickly spreads  homicide detectives Diana Pierce Rae Dawn Chong  her partner Charles Krieger Don Gordon are on the case  struggle to make sense of what's going on...Directed by John McNaughton who had previously made the notorious Henty Portrait of a Serial Killer 1986 this scifi horror comedy was his second feature film  is certainly something a little different  entertaining enough in it's own strange way. The script mixes scifi with social satire as our society is seen through the eyes of an alien the pitfalls  perils of our society like homelessness  the benefits like when he becomes the doctor  suddenly has lots of material possessions. It's almost like the alien lives an entire life in a few days as he comes into our world with nothing but almost ends up with everything he could want I think it's a neat little examination of our society without ever really being too deep or meaningful the script is more playful with it's ideas  humour than serious. At just under 90 odd minutes long the pace is pretty good  the story is enough to keep you watching but it does get a little repetitive towards a rather rushed  unfinished feeling climax none of the subplots or the main story get wrapped up to any great satisfaction. The Borrower has a fun  different central concept about a head stealing alien trying to survive on Earth but the script never really does anything with the premise the subplot about the cops  some criminal they are after never really goes anywhere the alien never seems to have any motive or goal or ambition as it wanders around the city doing nothing in particular  while it's entertaining enough I don't think I would want to watch it again.The Borrower has a very late 80's feel to it lots of neon lighting  latex gore effects rather than CGI. Speaking of gore it varies a lot of the gore scenes feel choppy  badly edited like they didn't shoot enough footage  had to make do with what they had there are a few headless bodies  a bit of blood splatter but not much else. There's a decent looking alien cockroach looking creature at the start but overall the effects vary from good to average. The only real grossout moment the film has to offer is when the alien in human form eats a dead rat. Rumour has it that The Borrower ran out of money  the production was shut down  wasn't released for a couple of years while there doesn't seem to be any huge gaps of narrative missing there certainly could have been some more fleshing out of the concept  character's.Filmed in Illinois in Chicago this looks quite good with decent production values  local scenery the effects are alright with some being pretty good. The acting is OK but having a fine actor like Tom Towles as the first alien was a bad idea as the other's after him don't compare despite being the 'same' alien but with a different head.The Borrower is a fun little scifi horror comedy with an oddball premise poking fun at our society but it never really goes that deep  the central concept which is all the film has really isn't enough to sustain 90 minutes entertaining enough for what it is  worth a watch for sure but in my opinion not a classic.".

The difference between him and a normal human is that he can rip people's heads off to replace his own which allows him to take their form. That being said you know there's gonna be plenty of decapitation action! Imagine THE HIDDEN also a super rad movie with less fast cars and more blood and slime.

	schema:reviewBody "Director John McNoughtonCast Rae Dawn Chong Don Gordon Tom Towles Antonio FargasTagline Dont lend him anything you cant afford to looseReviewDirector John Mc Naughtons follow up to Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer is a bmovie scifihorror flick. I know that might not make the best of sense to some of you because youd expect something grand after seeing Henry but this is the route that the director took. Its not a total waist though.An alien criminal is sentenced to earth as a punishment for his crimes. The worst part of his punishment is he will be a human all through out his sentence here on earth. And he has to take care of his body parts because they are fragile. After every couple of hours his head explodes so he goes around replacing it with other peoples heads and living out their lives. kind of like the same plot of a similar film called The Hidden only there the idea was better developed.The problem with this movie is that it becomes redundant after a while. The alien dude does nothing but going around switching heads and walking around acting like a retard repeating everything that everybody says and wobbling around like a zombie. Aside from this theres no real suspense or tension...its just a one note gag with a few amusing moments along the line.The film is trying to make a social commentary on humanity. Kind of the same way the Gremlins made fun of the worst things about us humans vices violence and the such the alien on this film goes around seeing the worst of the human species. Violence sex murder and greed all make an appearance with some funny results. I thought those scenes with the homeless where the best in the film. But ultimately the movie had a good premise a good idea and an opportunity to make a socially conscious scifihorror film but sadly it falls flat on its ass.The movie does come up with some interesting moments like those involving a dog wont spoil it dont worry and those head exploding scenes. There are some cool images int his film similar to the exploding head scenes in Scanners. Kevin Yagher and KNB effects guys did a decent job with the aliens and the make up effects. But these moments arent enough to save the movie from the poor execution that it was given.Rae Dawn Chung demonstrates in this movie why she is no longer making movies. She plays a detective on the hunt for the alien. Her performance sucks like crazy nothing special. On the other hand Tom Towles as the hillbilly guy hunting dear was funny as hell unfortunately he gets the least amount of screen time. Atonio Fargas as the homeless guy who befriends the alien had me cracking up a few times. They were the real highlights of the film for me. I thought they brought a certain amount of humor that the movie needed. I think the movie should have amped up the humor a little bit more given the type of film that this is.The ending for The Borrower was very unsatisfying. Aside from the fact that the movie doesnt build any suspense or momentum its just feels flat. I hate it when films just suddenly and abruptly end just like that and leave you hanging. Its purposely left open for a sequel but I dont think that it will ever get made.Ultimately I think this movie works as a bgrade cheesy fun time. It has some social commentary but it doesnt get its points across to well. If you dont mind ludicrous stories and situations or just a plain weird ass tale lightly sprinkled with social commentary then check The Borrower out. But if your in need of a conventionally told story that gives you suspense and chills then pass this one up watch The Hidden instead.Rating 2 12 out of 5".

On the other hand Tom Towles as the hillbilly guy hunting dear was funny as hell unfortunately he gets the least amount of screen time. Atonio Fargas as the homeless guy who befriends the alien had me cracking up a few times. They were the real highlights of the film for me. I thought they brought a certain amount of humor that the movie needed. I think the movie should have amped up the humor a little bit more given the type of film that this is.The ending for The Borrower was very unsatisfying. Aside from the fact that the movie doesnt build any suspense or momentum its just feels flat. I hate it when films just suddenly and abruptly end just like that and leave you hanging. Its purposely left open for a sequel but I dont think that it will ever get made.Ultimately I think this movie works as a bgrade cheesy fun time. It has some social commentary but it doesnt get its points across to well. If you dont mind ludicrous stories and situations or just a plain weird ass tale lightly sprinkled with social commentary then check The Borrower out. But if your in need of a conventionally told story that gives you suspense and chills then pass this one up watch The Hidden instead.Rating 2 12 out of 5";

Filmed primarily in 1988 THE BORROWER ended up sitting on a shelf for several years until Henry finally received a proper albeit limited theatrical release in 1990. The delay was likely caused by two favors 1. It was distributed by Cannon who were having major financial problems at the time and 2. so it could piggyback off of Henrys excellent reviews and publicity. Long story short it didn't work. The Borrower failed to come anywhere near the critical OR commercial success of the director's previous film. Instead it quickly faded from view after its initial VHS release. Even now the film is hardly ever discussed. Most interviewers just skip right over it when questioning McNaughton as if it doesn't even exist. One may assume all of that means this is awful but that turns out not to be the case at all. If anything this film is underrated and deserves much better treatment than it has received over the years.Things open aboard a spaceship where a buglike alien criminal receives the worst punishment an alien can receive being genetically devolved into a human ha! The alien Robert Dryer is then banished to Earth where he'll be forced to live out the rest of his days in the company of primitive Earth scum. Oh yeah there's one other tiny little problem because the aliens haven't quite mastered the deevolution technique the alien's head will occasionally explode and he'll be forced to acquire new ones every now and then. The banished alien is then dropped off and his head promptly pops. Thankfully a redneck poacher HENRY costar Tom Towles is around to become the first donor. Alien Towles manages to get a ride from a bimbo teenager Zoe Trilling after she runs him over and eventually finds himself wandering the streets of downtown Chicago where he's befriended by a homeless man Antonio Fargas. Things start to escalate from there. Rae Dawn Chong and Don Gordon play a pair of detectives trying to uncover why decapitated bodies and random heads keep turning up all over the city.What separates this film from numerous others of its type aside from a very unusual premise is McNaughton's ability to find quirky humor in the bleak urban setting. The grimy seedy downtown Chicago of Henry is pretty much the exact same Chicago seen in The Borrower. Druggies thugs hookers and homeless people lurk in the alleyways. People urinate right in the street and drop rats into someone's dinner at a soup kitchen gang members shoot up diners and  in addition to the alien killer  there's a violent serial rapist Neil Giuntoli on the loose. Hell there's even rampant degeneracy in places you may not expect like at a hospital where a doctor Tony Amendola is so busy screwing a nurse he doesn't seem to care that people are literally dying all around him. Even paying attention to minor details in the background you'll notice things like posters for child abuse. Everything pretty much is laid out to illustrate that this can be an ugly world we live in which pretty much just confirms that the alien's punishment was an apt one! While this could have easily ended up being depressing it's not at all because there's humor satire and  or social commentary around every turn. Instead of slapping together a routine scifi action buddy cop pursuit film McNaughton is aiming for something a bit different here. When it works it's great. When it doesn't you're zipped right along to something else so it hardly even matters.The film also offers up many odd hilarious and memorable scenes. My favorite is when a couple are lying in bed watching The Garbage Pail Kids Movie !! while their son's amateur rock band I like the part about killing your parents. are downstairs being attacked by the alien who's been reduced to wearing a dog's head! And then there are other bizarre scenes that quite frankly I have no idea what exactly they were shooting for but the set pieces are all entertaining bizarre and  or humorous. This film frequently receives two criticisms and both are valid. The first involves the special effects. While Kevin Yagher's gore makeups are really good there's no explanation behind why the alien's body size and skin color changes with each head swap. The second criticism involves the ending. Well actually this film really doesn't have an ending. It more kind of just stops and the credits roll. I'm not sure if they ran out of money or time but concluding things on such an anticlimactic rushed note leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Regardless flaws and all this is conceptually a lot more sophisticated and clever than numerous other ordinary horror and scifi films from the 80s and 90s that get a lot more undeserved love and attention than this one does.".

In its current form the film does not feature any noticeable narrative gaps except for a badlyrushed ending where the alien takes over an ambulance one of the worst rushjobs of an ending in recent genre history.Bad endings aside the film's main problem is that it has a plot that is more along the line of stuff happens than resembling a fully fleshedout story. The premise  that of an alien convict who goes around squeezing people's heads off  is very limited in scope. The idea never develops into anything more than that. Sensing this the screenwriters toss in a secondary plot about a pair of cops tracking down a rapist that while a reasonably good story on its own doesn't fit in with the rest of the film. If McNaughton who has shown that he can make a serial killer story effective persisted with the rapist angle he would have had a decent film instead of the hodgepodge film shown here. On the acting front almost everybody gives a decent performance. Chong  Don Gordon are well cast as the pair of cops. Guintoli who would later rather ironically star in the Henry sequel is suitably creepy as the rapist  the scene of him walking out of the hospital dressed in the uniform of a female cop that he had overpowered while said cop is lying on the hospital bed naked is the closest the film comes to disturbing the audience. As for the actors taking turns to play the alien Tom Towles sets the bar high  gets surprisingly good mileage in playing an alien creature who is wandering around the city mimicking the behaviour of passersby  spending the night  following morning at a homeless shelter but the other actors fail to match his performance exactly.In the film's favour the dark humour that McNaughton brings into the mix gives us a rather dark sense of irony.

It reminds me of The Hidden where Kyle Mclaughlin is fighting an other worldly alien that just wants to drive fast cars and listen to heavy metal. Each movie contains a host alien but only one contains Rae Dawn Chong! I'm mysteriously attracted to her in this she pulls a bit of film noir and wields a badge on the hunt for a rapist murderer. This movie has fabulous gore. There is very little backround music mostly white noise giving it a creepy texture. Some real funny moments and some nice out of focus stuff theres a point in the movie where just peripheral to a conversation in the police headquarters a battle takes place between a cop and a wild street tough. The only problem i have with this movie is most of the interactions between Chong and her partner are labored and seem like a pacing problem. But all the sequences with the alien ripping off heads or hitchhiking or pretending to be a human being are highly awesome. The end is splattastic a sequel is rumored but never done.".

It reminds me of The Hidden where Kyle Mclaughlin is fighting an other worldly alien that just wants to drive fast cars and listen to heavy metal. Each movie contains a host alien but only one contains Rae Dawn Chong! I'm mysteriously attracted to her in this she pulls a bit of film noir and wields a badge on the hunt for a rapist murderer. This movie has fabulous gore. There is very little backround music mostly white noise giving it a creepy texture. Some real funny moments and some nice out of focus stuff theres a point in the movie where just peripheral to a conversation in the police headquarters a battle takes place between a cop and a wild street tough. The only problem i have with this movie is most of the interactions between Chong and her partner are labored and seem like a pacing problem. But all the sequences with the alien ripping off heads or hitchhiking or pretending to be a human being are highly awesome. The end is splattastic a sequel is rumored but never done.";

It just keeps grabbing heads off of victims including a dog and swapping them out to survive. Chicago cop Diana Pierce Rae Dawn Chong is on the case though. This was John McNaughton's followup feature to HENRY PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER and I will admit it has a genius setup. Unfortunately the film completely lacks focus and feels like two scripts slapped together. Chong's cop character who apparently is assigned every case in and outside of the city spends too much time obsessing over a rapist she busted and they try to wrap this into the alien head snatching plot. When the film focuses on the alien bits it really shines thanks to great turns by Tom Towles as alien's first victim and Antonio Fargas as a homeless guy who befriends Towles. This was shot in the late 80s a movie marquee offers DAKOTA but not released until 1991. As a rule this should always be played as a double feature with JT Petty's THE BURROWERS.".

Still being an alien he wants to change his identity by ripping of heads and replacing his former head with it. It's all shown with the typical effects of that time I mean the bladder effects. It's all done by Kevin Yagher still in the business and known for MI 2 and Friday the 13th final chapter and some Nightmare on Elm Street episodes. So the effects are really good but the movie lacks in storyline they involved another killer Scully nothing to do with the alien and nothing to do with the storyline. He's in the movie for no reason and just got shot. I gave it a 5 just for the effects it's weird that with the actors known in that era and the director and effects that this isn't out on DVD you can find it still on VHS only in NTSC.

	schema:headline " A Remake of a Film that Never Needed to be Remade";
	schema:reviewBody "If one wants to remake a movie the best option is probably to choose and original that was good but not a great classic. Clearly any attempt to remake a concept that failed first time around is fraught with danger but an attempt to remake a classic runs the risk that one's film will be unfavourably compared with the original. The original 1968 film of 'Planet of the Apes' is one of cinema's great science fiction classics. More than an adventure story it touches on some of the concerns of the late sixties the fear of nuclear war race relations and also raises more fundamental issues about the relationship between man and nature the relationship between religion and science Darwinism and animal rights. It was therefore a brave move on Tim Burton's part to try and remake it. The main concept of Tim Burton's film is basically similar to Franklin Schaffner's. An astronaut from Earth travels to a planet ruled by intelligent apes. Humans exist on this planet but they are regarded as an inferior species despised and exploited by the apes. There is however an important difference. In the original film the apes are the only intelligent and articulate beings on the planet. Although they have only attained a preindustrial level of civilization they have firearms but no powerdriven machinery and no means of transport other than the horse or horsedrawn vehicles they are a far more advanced species than the planet's human inhabitants who lack the powers of speech and reason and live an animallike existence. In Burton's remake humans and apes have similar powers of speech and intellect it is only the apes' greater physical strength that enables them to dominate the planet and to treat the humans as slaves. It was this ironic rolereversal with apes behaving like men and men behaving like beasts that gave Schaffner's film its satirical power. That film was advertised with the slogan 'Somewhere in the Universe there must be something better than man!' and the apes are indeed in some respects better than man. Their law against killing others of their kind for example is much more strictly observed than our commandment that 'Thou shalt do no murder'. There is no sense that the apes are bad and the humans good. Even Dr Zaius the orangutan politician is not a wicked individual by the standards of his society he is an honourable and decent one. His weakness is that of excessive intellectual conservatism and unwillingness to accept opinions that do not fit in with his preconceived world view. In this respect the apes are very human indeed. Burton's film takes a less subtle moral line. It is a straightforward story of a fight for freedom. The villains are most of the apes especially the fanatical humanhating General Thade. The heroes are Captain Davidson the astronaut from Earth the planet's human population who long for freedom from the domination of the apes and a few liberal prohuman apes especially Ari the daughter of an ape senator. The apes are more aggressive and more obviously animals than in the original film they still frequently move on all fours and emit fierce shrieks whenever angry or excited. There are some things about this film that are good especially the ape makeup which is for the most part more convincing than in the original film and allows the actors more scope to show emotion. I say 'for the most part' because Ari looks far less simian than do most of the other apes Tim Burton obviously felt that the audience would be more likely to accept her as a sympathetic character if she looked halfhuman. The actors playing apes actually seem more convincing than those playing humans. Tim Roth is good as the militaristic Thade as is Helena BonhamCarter as Ari. Mark Wahlberg on the other hand is not an actor of the same caliber as Charlton Heston who played the equivalent role in the original film and Estella Warren has little to do other than look glamorous. Heston has a cameo role as an ape in Burton's film and even gets to repeat his famous line 'Damn you all to hell'. Overall however the film is a disappointment when compared to the original a simple sciencefiction adventure story as opposed to an intelligent and philosophical look at complex issues. It tried to copy the device of a surprise ending but failed. Schaffner's famous final twist is shocking but makes perfect sense in the context of what has gone before. Burton's makes no sense whatsoever.Tim Burton can be a director of great originality but with 'Planet of the Apes' he fell into the standard Hollywood trap of trying to copy what had already been done and remaking a film that never needed to be remade. It was good to see him return to form with the brilliant 'Big Fish' one of the best films of last year. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "Revisiting this film 13 years later makes me wonder why I hated it. I found this in MovieBox on my iPad. Loaded it up fired up AirServer and streamed it into my main Media PC then I sat back and got absorbed by this story like I never have been.And I actually enjoyed it  I first saw this when it came out thinking it was a pompous bloated misrepresentation of the original. Mainly I hated Mark Stumbling Rock Star Wahlberg But since then I have seen him in a few roles that suited him especially his character from The Departed.So I think that is what I had to get past my initial distaste for an actor I didn't know. I don't know why I didn't like him I just wasn't familiar with him.Compared to other Tim Burton films this one keeps the Camp level down compared to Sleepy Hollow or Mars Attacks  He returns to the Grimness of Batman. Burton approaches this as pure Science Fiction and treats it with more respect than Mars Attacks. In fact compared to Mars Attacks this is a serious movie.In 1963 Pierre Boulle author of Bridge on the River Kwai wrote a book called La Plante Des singes aka Monkey Planet which is told 3rd person to a kinky spacefaring couple who find a manuscript in a bottle floating in space. That story was the basis for the 1968 film and some of the events in the sequels. One of the aspects of Space Travel used in that 1963 novel was the prospect of Time Dilation in which time moves more rapidly on Earth than it does for Travelers moving at relativistic speeds. This was used heavily in this film as Wahlberg's monkey's pod gets sucked into a Wormhole and the Ship he is on starts seeing transmissions from all times instantaneously. But we see later that it is just not the Time Barrier that gets crossed some heavy Alternate Realities are taking place.This 2001 film returns to some of the original aspects of the book in that respect it is not as grim an ending as the 1968 version So the whole surprise ending of the Heston version is missing However the ending of this film is based on the ending of the book.As far as the Planet of the Apes in this film it looks good the CGI is great and does not look phony and Tim Roth is one nasty piece of work. The Nova character is played by Lisa Marie but not as a Major Character in fact they made Nova a Chimp in this one. The Hero's Squeeze is played by Estelle Warren Daena. The Ape Prosthetics are very well made and it is difficult to see Helena BonhamCarter as a Chimp or Michael Clarke Duncan as an Ape. But Tim Roth's Thade is a piece of slimy business and perfect casting.

Maybe this is why it did not go over that well just like 2001's Evolution with David Duchovny which also was not appreciated that year but today has been picking up fans who realize just how funny it really is.Ultimately time is the final judge not box office figures or the ratings of Websites that no longer exist. Nor does it matter that 1350 bad reviews of this were posted on IMDb many of those made by one person. As far as this movie goes it is worth it to go back and revisit. But when it comes to Planet of the Apes versus The Phantom Menace I choose BOTH versions of Planet of the Apes. I can find all kinds of good reasons why this is a much better movie than all three Star Wars prequels.".

	onyx:emotionText "Revisiting this film 13 years later makes me wonder why I hated it. I found this in MovieBox on my iPad. Loaded it up fired up AirServer and streamed it into my main Media PC then I sat back and got absorbed by this story like I never have been.And I actually enjoyed it  I first saw this when it came out thinking it was a pompous bloated misrepresentation of the original. Mainly I hated Mark Stumbling Rock Star Wahlberg But since then I have seen him in a few roles that suited him especially his character from The Departed.So I think that is what I had to get past my initial distaste for an actor I didn't know. I don't know why I didn't like him I just wasn't familiar with him.Compared to other Tim Burton films this one keeps the Camp level down compared to Sleepy Hollow or Mars Attacks  He returns to the Grimness of Batman. Burton approaches this as pure Science Fiction and treats it with more respect than Mars Attacks. In fact compared to Mars Attacks this is a serious movie.In 1963 Pierre Boulle author of Bridge on the River Kwai wrote a book called La Plante Des singes aka Monkey Planet which is told 3rd person to a kinky spacefaring couple who find a manuscript in a bottle floating in space. That story was the basis for the 1968 film and some of the events in the sequels. One of the aspects of Space Travel used in that 1963 novel was the prospect of Time Dilation in which time moves more rapidly on Earth than it does for Travelers moving at relativistic speeds. This was used heavily in this film as Wahlberg's monkey's pod gets sucked into a Wormhole and the Ship he is on starts seeing transmissions from all times instantaneously. But we see later that it is just not the Time Barrier that gets crossed some heavy Alternate Realities are taking place.This 2001 film returns to some of the original aspects of the book in that respect it is not as grim an ending as the 1968 version So the whole surprise ending of the Heston version is missing However the ending of this film is based on the ending of the book.As far as the Planet of the Apes in this film it looks good the CGI is great and does not look phony and Tim Roth is one nasty piece of work. The Nova character is played by Lisa Marie but not as a Major Character in fact they made Nova a Chimp in this one. The Hero's Squeeze is played by Estelle Warren Daena. The Ape Prosthetics are very well made and it is difficult to see Helena BonhamCarter as a Chimp or Michael Clarke Duncan as an Ape. But Tim Roth's Thade is a piece of slimy business and perfect casting. Not to mention Charleton Heston's Final Cameo and statement that denounces his own beloved NRA.We have no modern day Rod Serlings to write scripts but I think this script has given several nods to his work.I think this is one of those films like Bringing up Baby that is appreciated more and more years after it's release as Bringing up Baby is considered to be the classic example of slapstick comedy this film will have a place in the Film Vaults Visually it is astounding it's not at all like any of Tim Burton's other work of the time.

But they could have at least got the beginning right.  Neither Mark Wahlberg's character nor the tension is ever developed so when he is confronted by the apes we feel nothing.The humans though they have the benefit of increased intelligence and speech are poorly utilized.  And Kris Kristofferson is criminally wasted.The makeup and effects are as you would expect fantastic.  However despite improved flexibility in the makeup there is little warmth in either the performances or direction that made millions of kids go apenuts in the seventies.  BonhamCarter's Ari whilst convincing is not a patch on Kim Hunter's Zira.

	schema:reviewBody "In the spring of 2001 audiences seemed eager to see Tim Burton's retelling of the 1968 classic Planet of the Apes. By the summer of 2001 it seemed to be the movie everybody loved to hate. Were the criticisms fair? Not if you ask me.2001's Planet of the Apes' biggest downfall in my opinion is unfortunately also it's biggest strength. Unlike many remakes which often end up as nothing more than weaker rehashes of their predecessor's this version of 'Apes' dared to be different. The plot has been stripped down to its bare bones and then rebuilt into something completely new. This is refreshing if you ask me. Especially when rewatching it now because just a few short years after this film came out we launched into sort of a remake renaissance where half the tent pole films that come out every year are the same lesser rehashes that I spoke of a second ago. This film does take a moment here and there to wink at the '68 original but Burton and his merry band of screenwriters has created a world completely original...it could be watched next to any entry of that original series as a wholey different film.This is also the film's biggest flaw though or at least financially speaking because the original 'Apes' franchise has a cult following behind it that could almost rival that of Star Wars or Star Trek. The core audience for this film really only wanted to see their favourite story told with modern day effects and makeup. I don't think we needed that but I'm not sure how many would agree with me.Now if you want to compare the two films plots and decide which one is stronger that's a whole other debate. But I don't think that's fair that's why I champion it for taking such a different approach. I don't think this movie should be compared to any other movie and with that mindset a much better appreciation can be found. To put it bluntly this movie ain't bad...in fact it's actually pretty good.I won't deconstruct the plot for you...if you're interested enough to be reading this you probably at least know the jist of it anyway. But it's a solid and interesting plot that sets up a very fun and entertaining action adventure flick. Visually its in many ways a departure from typical Burton fair but his stamp is definitely evident in its art direction and the atmosphere he creates in this jungledeserturbanhigh tech universe is really something to behold. The apes are not only impressive in terms of makeup but they are also creatively impressive from the choices of the species to match personalities the incredible costumes and simply perfect performances by a cast who act through all that latex. And while I'm praising I'll also throw up a shout out for Danny Elfman's great score which just might be one of his best.The only caveat I'll lay on the movie is that the twist ending obviously conceived to rival the famous twist of the original kind of falls flat. BUT...considering how many instalments the original franchise had I have no doubt that the producers had hoped to make a sequel had this film been more financially successful and had that sequel been made maybe we would've learned the story behind this twist and all would've been forgiven.It's a little too late to say 'long story short' but I will anyway. Give this movie a fair shot. It may not be without its flaws but how many movies are? Try not to compare it to the original just watch it with a bowl of popcorn and have fun.".

This movie on the other hand seems to have done away with pretty much ALL the dialogues. Instead of a great movie we get an incredibly stupid two hour chase movie. Dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum character interaction and development are nonexistent and most of the time it's extremely hard to figure out what's going on. Instead we get a bunch of pointless action scenes some marginally funny oneliners and some very hollow quasiintelligent conversations. The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic. The makeup of the apes is magnificent and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too. However this does not distract from the fact that Planet of the Apes 2001 is a very shallow and simplistic movie filled with paperthin characters stupid dialogue and a nearly nonexistent plot. Please Hollywood stop ruining great movies by turning them into senseless blockbusters.Oh yeah the ending did not make ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER. out of  stars mainly for the visuals".

Must we travel 1300 million kilometers to Saturn to conduct these experiments? The special effects team decrees it.Marky's chimp gets lost in that staple of 60s scifi cinema  the Time Warp. Marky then demonstrates the space station's mindboggling security ineptness by stealing a pod without anyone noticing while simultaneously demonstrating his abject stupidity in mounting a deepspace rescue mission into a wormhole for an expendable test chimp with a million dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen supplies.Before anyone can say Pointless Remake' Marky has surfed the wormhole crashed on an alien planet removed his helmet without any thought to the lethality of the atmosphere and is being chased through a sound stage that almost resembles a lush rainforest if it weren't for the kliegs backlighting the plastic trees.Surprise! It's APES doing the chasing  or at least it would have been a surprise if no one saw Planet Of The Apes THIRTYTHREE YEARS AGO.Since Marky Mark did not get to show his pecs take down his pants or bust his lame whiteboy rap he was characterless. Michael Clarke Duncan's gorilla teeth being inserted crookedly helped immensely in establishing his lack of character. Helena BonhamCarter aka irritating chimp activist at a loss without a Shakespearean script did a fine job of outdoing both Marky and Clarke as Most Cardboard Cutout. Paul Giamatti the orangutan slave trader secured the role of token comic relief and interspecies klutz. Though I have grown bilious in hearing puns relating to this movie one review headline captured the essence of this Planet Of The Apes reimagining' The Apes Of Roth'. While everyone else minced about looking like extras from One Million Years BC or Greystoke Tim Roth as Chimpanzee Thade chews massive amounts of scenery and hurls kaka splendiferously. As entertaining as his portrayal of the psychotic Thade was his character lacked a behavioral arc Thade is mad when we first meet him... and he's pretty much at the same level of mad at film's end. Nice twist.The original POTA 1968 featured a leading character Charlton Heston's Taylor who was so disenchanted with mankind that he left earth for space with no regrets  yet as that film progressed Taylor unwittingly found himself locked in a battle to prove mankind's worth  as their sole champion! The original film was ultimately a tale of humiliation not salvation when Taylor discovers the Statue of Liberty he is forced to realize that his species had NOT prevailed. Is there anything that cerebral or ironic to Marky Mark's Leo? Or Roth's Thade? No but there's lots of running.The slogans cry Take Back The Planet .but it's the APES' planet. In this movie humans and apes crashlanded here together the humans having degenerated to cavepeople allowing the apes to acquire speech and sensual body armor the apes DESERVED to inherit the planet! Along comes Marky Mark in true anthropocentric arrogance taking it for granted that humans HAVE to be the apex predators simply because they're there.  Taking it back' is as ludicrous as apes landing here in 2001 complaining A planet where men evolved from APES??!!' and then causing trouble with their overacting and hairy anuses.Heston was cast in the 1968 POTA because he had established his reputation as a maverick he WAS BenHur Michelangelo Moses! To cast him as the mute dogged animal in an alien society was to stupefy an audience's expectations how crazed must a world be where Our Man Charlton cannot command respect? Marky Mark has currently only established that he has tight underpants.Though Heston was denigrated constantly by the ape council he dominated the screen with his charisma and stupendous overacting. When Marky Mark tries to instill fervor in the mongoloid humans it's like that unpopular guy in school suddenly being made classroom monitor who tells you to stop drawing penises on the blackboard and you throw a shoe at him. Burton tries to elevate Marky to humanity's icon but he comes off as a chittering deviant. In the original film the apes deem Taylor a deviant yet he was to audience and apes alike an icon of humanity. That irony again.It was apt that a man who elevated scenechewing to an acting technique  Heston  should play the father of this film's primo scenechewer Thaddeus Roth. As Roth's apedad Charlton utters his own immortal lines turned against the HUMANS this time Damn them! Damn them all to hell!'The movie gets dumb and dumber towards the end. While Thaddeus is giving Marky an assbeating lesson a pod descends from on high with Marky's chimpnaut in it. Apes demonstrate their hebetude by bowing in obeisance to this incognizant creature while Marky proves his own hebetude by muttering Let's teach these monkeys about evolution.' Firstly they're not monkeys you ape! Secondly it was genetic tampering and imbecilic plot fabrications which brought the apes to this point not evolution. And what you intend to teach them by blowing them away with the concealed lasergun is called misanthropy not evolution.Giving away the twist ending would only confuse viewers into believing that Estella Warren's halfnekkid role was actually integral to the plot be still my pants..No matter that he was humankind's last underpanted hope in the end cop apes take Marky away to Plot Point Prison where he was last heard ululating It's a madhouse!

I respect the original for what it was but this version directed by Tim Burton is visually spectacular and exceeds expectations.Nobody creates a fanciful world like Burton can and there is no better duo than Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter. The costumes for the apes are incredible with intricate details that look very realistic. The sheer enormity of the sets makes you realise how much energy and passion went into creating this film.I love all the action and the special effects still seem remarkable even after more than 10 years has past. Sometimes people can't move past the original but if you have never seen the 1968 version then I think you will enjoy this movie. Also it is perfect to watch again now that the new planet of the apes movie series has started to be released.".

	schema:headline " Burton is no good as a gunforhire director";
	schema:reviewBody "If there's one thing that annoys me most in seeing a bad film it's seeing it done by experienced filmmakers who ought to know better. This reimagining of Planet of the Apes could have used some imagination to say nothing of essential elements of character development. Nova the girl in the original Planet of the Apes was a better developed character than Daena in this version for all that she does not say a single word. One certainly expected a lot better from Tim Burton a man who has hitherto combined an incredible visual imagination with intelligence wit and humour all of which were notably absent from this production.There were problems in basic plot development. The first big mistake was allowing the humans to talk. This was the fundamental difference between apes and men that made all the difference in the original film. Even while he was mute his ability to communicate was what marked out Heston's Taylor as being different from the other humans. In the current film Mark Wahlberg encourages the talking human slaves to revolt but there is no overpowering reason for them to have not revolted and reclaimed their emancipation already. They are dexterous toolusers and have the ability to communicate in order to form plans something mute humans can't do. It needs no man to fall from the stars to save them. Indeed since he comes from a technological civilisation and finds himself in a pretechnology era without at first any gadgets to help him it is Wahlberg who ought to be at a disadvantage not the humans who are used to living there.It was sad to see Helena Bonham Carter working so hard to generate some kind of spark between herself and that unresponsive brick wall Mark Wahlberg. Her best scenes were with the villainous Tim Roth.The humans were practically ignored until they were needed in the third act at which point Daena started showing some actual interest in Davidson Wahlberg and a young boy suddenly changed from part of the background to a feisty gungho freedomfighter. This was poor character development. Estella Warren in particular looked as if she would have been capable of a great deal more than she was given in the script. Wahlberg's puzzlement at the end as to what these humans see in him was certainly shared by me as he has scarcely interacted with the humans throughout.Creating the apes half a plus point and two minuses Ape makeup was excellent on the males particularly Michael Clarke Duncan who has incredibly expressive eyes which was why he was so good in The Green Mile and the makeup design allowed him to use them fully. But the ape females looked like nothing on earth neither ape nor human. The minuses were the ape jumps which looked about as realistic as Flash Gordon's rocket jumping apes looked as if they'd just been fired from a catapult they had none of the longlimbed grace of genuine apes. Secondly the poor sound mixing  when the gorillas roar it is quite clearly dubbed from some animal probably feline making them sound ridiculous and unrealistic.In the original film the various human things the apes do and say are handled as light relief I never knew an ape I didn't like. Human see human do!. Here the apes just talk matteroffactly exactly as 21st Century humans do and there is no humour in it at all. The only genuinely original idea was Ari writing with her feet.Nothing made me cringe more than the VGer from Star Trek moment near the end of the film. First of all the apes had apparently been able to read Roman lettering in the distant past for them to know the name of the Forbidden Zone in its partly concealed form. Secondly the mysterious inscription giving the name is merely covered with sand which Wahlberg just brushes away something any ape could have done centuries ago. This moment was for me far worse than the muchmaligned ending of the movie.Things of that nature however are typical of most science fiction movies of today. Back in the '60s and '70s they generally didn't have the budget to make convincing futuristic sets but they dealt with genuinely original themes and ideas which were truly science fictional. I'm thinking of 2001 A Space Odyssey the 1967 Planet of the Apes THX1138 Soylent Green Silent Running and the 1972 Solaris. The first Planet of the Apes even utilised the only scientifically valid and physically possible method of travelling forward in time. However this film includes just about every bad science fiction clich going space storms anomalies and worm holes straight out of Star Trek the planets of the solar system and their moons apparently all visible together as large globes in reality from any one planet all other bodies even their own moons are just points of light a conventional rocket powered shuttle travelling from Saturn to Earth in a matter of minutes instead of years twothousand year old equipment firing up and fully working the minute the hero presses the button. To say nothing of a conveniently bulletproof internal glass door. In a contemporary setting you'd have to explain why it was bullet proof but because it's science fiction you don't have to!Overall Burton's most disappointing film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is another of director Tim Burton's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring his vision' to the screen.  He has done it with Batman' Sleepy Hollow' and now this.  This is not a remake.  The only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak and Charleton Heston makes a cameo.  Burton has reconstituted the entire story watering it down for today's mass viewership.The original Planet of the Apes was a product of its time.  During the 1960's America was struggling to redefine its civilization.  It was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms.  It was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal.  In that context POTA was allegorical reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day.  POTA was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of American society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior.  The dialectic between Colonel Taylor Charleton Heston Dr. Cornelius Roddy McDowall and Dr. Zira Kim Hunter was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious.Burton's version is as much a product of today's times as POTA was of the sixties.  This is Apes for Dummies.  It is superficial and jejune substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance.  The surprise' ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel.  While the ending of the original POTA gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene Burton's ending simply mocks the audience taunting I know something you don't know and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out.'From a technical perspective as is always the case with Burton's film the film is excellent.  The makeup is fantastic and Burton's camerawork is outstanding though I continue to dislike his dark look.  However thirtythree years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script.The story has been reduced to a monster movie.  The humans band together behind Captain Davidson Mark Wahlberg to fight the monstrous Apes aided and abetted by a few turncoats notably Helena Bonham Carter as Ari.  The presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence perfect for today's fast food mentality.The acting is mixed.  Mark Wahlberg is a fine actor who is simply miscast in this role.  Walberg is excellent at playing dark sullen characters that are tormented but strong.  This part requires an inspirational hero a profile not in Wahlberg's repertoire.  Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable.  She tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager.Then there is Tim Roth.  His is a virtuoso performance singlehandedly saving the film from total ruin.  Roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent General Thade.  He creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys I can remember in some time.  Additionally his physical acting is superlative rendering a chimpman that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists.This film is a great disappointment.  It is decent entertainment as long as you check your brain at the door.  I rated it a 310.  From a technical perspective it is much better than that perhaps a 910.  However the story is an insult to the original franchise.  It is simply another attempt by Burton at self adulation using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is.  Of course it's true but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption.".

Mark Wahlberg as Our Hero has none of the cynical edgy complexity of Heston's Taylor and is in fact the sort of cando flyboy Taylor found laughable.

The role is also a criminal waste of Bonham Carter's beauty hidden as it is behind a bizarre makeup that looks neither ape nor human.  Rick Baker's highlytouted ape makeups which I've enjoyed since the days of Schlock and Kentucky Fried Movie are highly uneven here.  Tim Roth's villainous Thade has the best with most of the rest being just adequate and no particular improvement over John Chambers' work in the original.  And the socko ending keep reading I won't spoil it for you is simply tacked on unlike the jolting end of the original it neither ties together nor arises from the movie's earlier action in a way that Explains Everything.  Instead it begs so many questions mainly How the heck did THAT happen? that it seems engineered or contrived solely to set the stage for more sequels.  All told this is Apes Lite a comicbookish caricature of the original made for the shortattentionspan crowd.  It made me want to do something I hadn't done in ages fire up the VCR and roll the original again.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a remake of the old classic starring Charlton Heston though as happens with a lot of remakes these days while following the theme the plot works out differently. In the original film Charlton Heston travels to the Andromeda Galaxy and when he returns 2000 years in the future he discovers that he has landed on a planet that is ruled by apes. It is only by the end of the film that he discovers that it is Earth. This film had the memorable lines of 'take your stinking paws off me you damned dirty ape' and 'You Maniacs! You blew it up! Ah damn you! God damn you all to hell!' This version doesn't end as dramatically as the original he returns to Earth to discover that the Earth that he knew was gone and is populated by apes and the first line spoken by an ape to a human instead of the other way around as in the original movie is 'Get your stinking hands off me you damn dirty human!'. Further the film begins in a space station orbiting Saturn where they are investigating a magnetic vortex and the hero lands up on the planet of the apes when he travels through the vortex and lands up a thousand years in the future.I have probably given away a bit too much of the movie but considering that it involves time travel and also involves changes to the time stream such as the space station entering the vortex and arriving at the planet centuries before our hero I am at a loss to see how 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' which I have not seen at the time of this writing could possibly be a prequel to this movie. Somebody has suggested that it involves the scene at the end however it is clear from the inscription behind the statue that Thade the bad guy in this film somehow came to earth prior to our hero and upset the order so we have another time travel dilemma. It is quite clever how Tim Burton constructed this movie since it is its own sequel and prequel though we do not know how Thade managed to get off of the planet of the apes and to earth.Like the original film the apes are an advanced iron age culture similar to Rome and they borrow the title of senator and also have their weapons and armour similar to that of the Romans. However a major difference is that the humans can speak in this film though as slaves they are forbidden. However that is likely to be because in the original the action occurs after two thousand years had passed whereas the action in this movie only occurred centuries though it appears that the genetic manipulation of the apes on the space station had quickened the apes rate of evolution.There is a subtle dig at religion in this film. The apes have a religion and they worship the first ape who had created them and believe that he left and will return. However an ape does come from the sky at the end of the film and it turns out that it is the ape that our hero had originally gone out to find. I guess the suggestion is that while our religion may have some truth to it in reality it is simply a load of myth that is manipulated by the power brokers to create the world that they want and to force the population to submit to their will. Well all I can say to that is that we live in a pluralistic society and the times when one denomination would call the shots in any one country or region are long gone at least in our Western Society. These days if we don't like what our church is teaching us we can simply walk out and find one that we do like. Some say that is good others say that is bad however as far as I'm concerned the bible is legit and I shall continue to believe it.The other interesting thing that I noticed is the idea of the animalistic nature of us humans. The idea is that despite all of the trappings of civilisation that we surround ourselves with in our hearts we are still barbarians. While the apes have rising to become dominant reducing the humans to the status of animals much in the same what that certain races of humans were relegated to the status of animals in the past in many cases they are still beasts. While they can talk and reasons their behaviour suggests that they are still little more than animals. In a way this aspects reflects us as humans because despite the fact that we are able to put somebody on the moon we still behave in a way that would make an onlooker believe that we are mindless animals driven only by lust and desire.".

I guess the suggestion is that while our religion may have some truth to it in reality it is simply a load of myth that is manipulated by the power brokers to create the world that they want and to force the population to submit to their will. Well all I can say to that is that we live in a pluralistic society and the times when one denomination would call the shots in any one country or region are long gone at least in our Western Society. These days if we don't like what our church is teaching us we can simply walk out and find one that we do like. Some say that is good others say that is bad however as far as I'm concerned the bible is legit and I shall continue to believe it.The other interesting thing that I noticed is the idea of the animalistic nature of us humans. The idea is that despite all of the trappings of civilisation that we surround ourselves with in our hearts we are still barbarians. While the apes have rising to become dominant reducing the humans to the status of animals much in the same what that certain races of humans were relegated to the status of animals in the past in many cases they are still beasts. While they can talk and reasons their behaviour suggests that they are still little more than animals. In a way this aspects reflects us as humans because despite the fact that we are able to put somebody on the moon we still behave in a way that would make an onlooker believe that we are mindless animals driven only by lust and desire.";

I liked the plot the actors the directing and I think this movie is way underrated since it's being compared to the original which I heard is not even close to this plot.

	schema:headline " This movie with great potential was ruined by the ending and lack of development of characters...";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all this movie is not as bad as a lot of the reviews make it out to be.  Second it didn't bore me and I was actually pretty content with the film until the last 10 min.SPOILER When the chimp landed on the planet during the big final battle  I just knew that this film was spiraling down and in my opinion it did.Mostly everyone knows the story of this movie regardless if they've seen it or not.  It's about a human pilot Leo Davidson Mark Wahlberg who crash lands on a planet ruled by apes a few thousand years in the future and tries to escape because the living conditions of humans there are very poor due to the tyranny of the apes.  This simple plot I think would have made for a good movie.  Also I'd like to mention that I haven't seen the original Planet of the Apes so I'm making no comparison.  However what ruined this movie was the fact that there were too many plot holes.  A big part about enjoying a movie is to understand the story and when a movie is presented with a plotholed storyline you'll be spending a lot of time wondering instead of letting yourself enjoy the film.Anyway the plot summary seems very simple yet the movie is cluttered with so many different things going on.  This proves to be a big obstacle for portraying the development of the characters.  This was unfortunate because I believed that the characters were worth relating to especially Daena Estella Warren.  Actually now that I think of it she had about 5 lines in the film other than that all she had to do was pose and by the time of her last scene I still didn't know her name.Another thing that bothered me about the film was the somewhat lovetriangle between Leo Ari and Daena.  Throughout the movie it was so obvious that a romance between Leo and Daena would've worked well but they didn't even have a conversation together.  As for putting Ari in this equation it was just a bad idea because why would Leo even give Ari a second thought as a love interest when he has the HUMAN Daena right in front of him.  It was clear from the beginning that Daena was smitten with Leo yet he doesn't even notice because he's too busy with trying to get off the planet which is understandable but I think it would have been good for the film if Leo and Daena had connected emotionally.  First of all Estella Warren who I think has enormous potential would have had a better role.  She could have been sort of the woman behind the great man helping him believe in himself and just being there for him.  They really wasted the character of Daena in my opinion.  It's also unfair for others to criticize Estella Warren's acting I mean how much better could she have been with the script she was given?Thade annoyed me after a while because he sneered and growled too much. However overall I didn't think Tim Roth did such a bad job.I've mentioned how Daena's character was wasted well actually all the human characters weren't much for the plot.  Karubi Daena's father had absolutely no relevence to the film.  Birn Luke Eberl the boy was a waste of screen space and then they try to make him important during the end of the film but that falls through because his character didn't develop just like everyone else.SPOILER Attar's Michael Clarke Duncan conversion at the end of the film was also unbelievable.  It's also hard to believe that when Thade gets stuck in the ship and starts shooting off his gun that he didn't get hit at all even though there were like 7 bullets ricocheing off the tiny room at the same time.Finally the ending.  A movie's ending can make it or break it.  This movie's ending broke it.  It left far too many questions unanswered but not only that it didn't make any sense AT ALL!  I have a feeling that the movie makers only put this ending in so that people will hear through word of mouth about this twist ending and make them want to see it.  It's nothing but a money making sham which unfortunately is working.  It leaves room for so many different types of sequels what bothers me is that it doesn't seem to leave room for most of the characters to return for the sequel eg. Daena Ari....Well this movie was a feast for the eyes it's visually a masterpiece but unfortunately visuals aren't enough to make a great movie a story and characters one can relate to are still the key and unfortunately this movie lacked this.  It's definitely a movie worth a look at just not at the price of today's cinema admission.".

They use monkeys as subjects for experiments and also send them out in pods very similar to Kubrick's in 2001 in fact their whole space station looks the same more to come on that... to do experiments. Well they find some weird force field stuff and send a monkey out. What else happens but they lose communication. Well Marky Mark being the animal lover that he is goes out and tries to save his monkey friend. But alas he is sucked through the forcefieldblackholeblahblah and crash lands on a strange planet. He lands in the midst of a human round up where the apes are getting the humans to sell in the slave market.The main symbolism in this movie is racism. Unlike the first movie the people in this movie can talk. After the apes catch the humans they sort them out in groups of male and female. Hmm sounds like a Nazi concentration camp to me. The apes don't notice that Marky Mark is wearing a weird space outfit and everyone else is wearing rags made from animal skin.Marky Mark realizes that apes don't like humans too much so he tries to escape. He is helped by an humanlover Ari to escape the city.SPOILER ALERT They get out of the city and Marky Mark finds his old ship via GPS or something. He then realizes that the ship has been there for thousands of years and figures out he traveled through time. The movie never tries to make you think it is earth though. It's just some weird planet. You also find out all the monkeys they had onboard all CHIMPS are the apes now on that planet. Pretty hard to believe considering there are all types of great apes gorilla chimp and orangutan. Anyway they have a battle with the apes hmmm reminds me of....SPARTACUS another Kubrick film. The humans win and Marky Mark leaves without saying a word the entire last 10 minutes of the film not even to the very hot Estella Warren who looks very good in her costume. He goes through the portal...blah blah....lands on earth.blah blah but is greeted by a monkey statue at the Lincoln memorial. He crash landed right on the steps don't ya know and the movie ends. blah. The first movie had a good surprise ending leaving us realizing that man destroyed themselves as a result of their violence. This movie doesn't explain why apes and humans have changed places except with some stupid blurb by Charleton Heston explaining that man is violent blah blah that is why they cannot regaion control blah blah. It's a case of always has always will be or segregation today segregation tomorrow segregation forver blah blah. Stupid movie. blah.".

It's hard to say if it was better I'd say they are almost on different grounds due to the Special FX we had in the 60's and the stuff we got now. So that changes a lot but it's not just the FX the story is great it keeps you guessing and near the end you just..don't know what to expect I didn't and I read about the ending on the net anyway. This was defiantly a ReImagining not a Remake This is so different than the first. In fact I don't even know what the heck the ending was about was it earth was it another planet...I swear you think about the ending to this movie for more than 5 minutes your head will explode. But all I can say is this movie rocks great acting awesome story sweet plot I'm just stoked for the sequel!".

So that changes a lot but it's not just the FX the story is great it keeps you guessing and near the end you just..don't know what to expect I didn't and I read about the ending on the net anyway. This was defiantly a ReImagining not a Remake This is so different than the first. In fact I don't even know what the heck the ending was about was it earth was it another planet...I swear you think about the ending to this movie for more than 5 minutes your head will explode. But all I can say is this movie rocks great acting awesome story sweet plot I'm just stoked for the sequel!";

	schema:headline " Biggest disappointment of 2001!";
	schema:reviewBody "Awhile back I commented on the original 'Planet of the Apes' film prior to seeing this remake at the cinemas. When I saw the original I was fully expecting the remake to kick some serious butt and be far superior to the 1960s version. Why? Better visual effects being 2001 and all one of my favorite actors in Tim Roth starring in it and a great director named Tim Burton. Nothing could surely go wrong with Burton in the director's chair. Granted I was never a huge fan of the POTA films but seeing the potential here for a remake or revision by Burton made my mouth water. Then in 2001 I got advance tickets and I began to watch one of the most anticipated movies for that year...I left the cinema very disappointed! Disappointment can cloud criticism though and sometimes makes you bitter towards a movie and not see the positives. So I tried to look at the good. The makeup was excellent but inconsistent in parts but I still feel that area should have been nominated for an Oscar. Okay that's good! Tim Roth was amazing in his performance but his character was not that great and seriously lacked depth. Helena Bonham Carter was also fairly decent in this film. And finally some of the cinematography was fairly nice. What really let the remake of 'Planet of the Apes' down was by in large Tim Burton. This is without a doubt his worst film that I've seen! I cannot really compliment the direction of this movie as it seemed selfaware and indulgent in being the remake. The script was awful as well as the integration of oneliners from the original films to this new one. I groaned completely during Heston's cameo particularly due the referrals to the original film. The remake should have been a film in its own right and should have focused on creating a compelling story and universe instead of opting for lame jokes revolving around Charlton Heston in ape makeup as Thade's father. The hero of the new film in Mark Whalberg was onenote but he was given such a boring character who just went through the motions. Going to take a risk check gets sucked through a new dimension check captured by Apes check escape check and so on and so on. I never felt anything for his character at all and that was partly his performance and partly the woeful scriptdirection. Estella Warren was awful and Kris Kristofferson played the obligatory predictable role of the her father. Michael Clarke Duncan suited his part but never became a well established character and Paul Giamatti was okay as Limbo but was obviously the comic relief. I also did not like the art direction was the Ape City and found the original far more convincing in look and as a story.While General Thade was certainly a memorable chimp because of Roth's performance it's a shame the character was wasted in an extremely formulaic and cliche story! 'Planet of the Apes' 2001 is nowhere near the worst film of 2001 it certainly was the most disappointing for me considering the potential it had with the dynamic vision of Tim Burton and the modern visual fx to create a film that stands out in its own right. It's just a pity Tim Burton chose to make a Hollywoodized selfaware gimmicky version that ends up being significantly inferior to the original film instead of on par with it! And yes Burton's 'Mars Attacks' is also better than his remake here! 'Planet of the Apes' gets a reluctant pass for Tim Roth's performance the superb makeup and the decent cinematography however that still doesn't save it from silly mediocrity. out of !".

	schema:reviewBody "In a brilliant solution for continuing the storyline after the ending of BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES three intelligent chimpanzees from Earth's future take off in Charlton Heston's salvaged spacecraft just prior to Earth's destruction they wind up hurled backward in time to 1973 California and  in an interesting twist on the original theme  now find themselves the strange visitors in a strange world ruled by bombastic human beings.Lovable simians Zira and Cornelius expertly played by Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall lose their friend Dr. Milo Sal Mineo! early on in a tragic accident and find themselves in a strange situation when mankind first welcomes them as celebrities and garnishes them with gifts but ultimately begins to fear when it is learned that Zira is pregnant with an ape offspring that could grow to overtake humanity.We really grow to sympathize with the plight of the chimpanzee couple and we fear along with them and the safety of their child when they become hunted fugitives later in the story. Eric Braeden is very good as the quintessential villain out to kill the ape family at any cost.Some people enjoy picking on the APES sequels as they continued but I've always felt this series consistently remained very intelligent and had something powerful to say about race relations and prejudice. People want to know how apes could ever manage to send Taylor's ship into orbit I say that if you can suspend disbelief long enough to accept the notion of intelligent apes then it shouldn't be that far a reach to accept that Dr. Milo was the genius of his time who just could pull it off the Thomas Edision of his type if you will.The timeline in the five apes films is often admittedly contradictory but there are ways that fans of the Apes movies have been able to make them work. For example in this film Cornelius seems to talk about Ape History and Evolution in a way that actually doesn't follow suit during the next two installments. That's because the very arrival of Zira and Cornelius onto presentday Earth of 1973 and the subsequent birth of their baby will accelerate the procedure from how Cornelius remembered it as we'll see in the next two chapters. The circumstances for the future will be sped up and changed and the apes will evolve at a much quicker rate.Some of the other dubious complaints are aimed at the lesser budgets or supposed TV Movie Look of the sequels from this point on  but this story in ESCAPE does not require mindnumbing special effects or hordes of CGIrendered ape figures swarming Los Angeles to make it effective. It's got a lot of heart and good writing with characters we care about and that's all it needs.12 out of ".

	onyx:emotionText "In a brilliant solution for continuing the storyline after the ending of BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES three intelligent chimpanzees from Earth's future take off in Charlton Heston's salvaged spacecraft just prior to Earth's destruction they wind up hurled backward in time to 1973 California and  in an interesting twist on the original theme  now find themselves the strange visitors in a strange world ruled by bombastic human beings.Lovable simians Zira and Cornelius expertly played by Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall lose their friend Dr. Milo Sal Mineo! early on in a tragic accident and find themselves in a strange situation when mankind first welcomes them as celebrities and garnishes them with gifts but ultimately begins to fear when it is learned that Zira is pregnant with an ape offspring that could grow to overtake humanity.We really grow to sympathize with the plight of the chimpanzee couple and we fear along with them and the safety of their child when they become hunted fugitives later in the story. Eric Braeden is very good as the quintessential villain out to kill the ape family at any cost.Some people enjoy picking on the APES sequels as they continued but I've always felt this series consistently remained very intelligent and had something powerful to say about race relations and prejudice. People want to know how apes could ever manage to send Taylor's ship into orbit I say that if you can suspend disbelief long enough to accept the notion of intelligent apes then it shouldn't be that far a reach to accept that Dr. Milo was the genius of his time who just could pull it off the Thomas Edision of his type if you will.The timeline in the five apes films is often admittedly contradictory but there are ways that fans of the Apes movies have been able to make them work. For example in this film Cornelius seems to talk about Ape History and Evolution in a way that actually doesn't follow suit during the next two installments. That's because the very arrival of Zira and Cornelius onto presentday Earth of 1973 and the subsequent birth of their baby will accelerate the procedure from how Cornelius remembered it as we'll see in the next two chapters. The circumstances for the future will be sped up and changed and the apes will evolve at a much quicker rate.Some of the other dubious complaints are aimed at the lesser budgets or supposed TV Movie Look of the sequels from this point on  but this story in ESCAPE does not require mindnumbing special effects or hordes of CGIrendered ape figures swarming Los Angeles to make it effective. It's got a lot of heart and good writing with characters we care about and that's all it needs.12 out of ";

	schema:headline " A Film in its Own Right Not Just a Sequel";
	schema:reviewBody "After Planet of the Apes was completed its star Charlton Heston argued strongly that there should not be a sequel. The original film was complete in itself and any sequel would only dilute its impact and tarnish its reputation. In the event a sequel was made and Heston was reluctantly persuaded to appear in it. He suggested however that it should end with the destruction of the Earth a denouement that he hoped would put paid to any attempt to extend the series beyond two films.In one respect Heston was to be proved right. Planet of the Apes is a classic one of the best sciencefiction movies ever made and one that combines an exciting plot with philosophical depth. It is frequently said that sequels are generally inferior to the original films but seldom is this is as true as in the case of Beneath the Planet of the Apes a hopeless mess of a film. Neither its lack of artistic merit however nor its explosive ending dissuaded the filmmakers from making a third Apes film. An ingenious device was found to avoid the problems posed by planetary destruction it is explained that shortly before the Earth was destroyed three of the apes found the wreckage of Taylor's spacecraft repaired it and used it to travel back in time to 1970s America.Although one of the apes is killed in an unfortunate incident shortly after arrival the American public take to the two survivors Cornelius and his wife Zira both of whom played important parts in the first two films. The two intelligent talking chimpanzees become media celebrities and the early scenes are much lighter in tone than the two earlier films at times even comic as the two apes become afterdinner speakers and discover the joys of alcohol. The tone however gradually darkens. Figures in the government become alarmed by talk of a future in which men are dominated by apes and Dr Hasslein the President's sinister Germanic adviser based on Henry Kissinger? is convinced that Zira and Cornelius represent a threat to the human race especially after it is discovered that Zira is pregnant.My disappointment with Beneath.... had hitherto dissuaded me from watching any more of the later episodes in the Apes canon so I was pleasantly surprised by Escape........ Although it lacks the depth and brilliance of Planet of the Apes it is considerably better than its immediate predecessor. The reason for its relative success lies with the fine contributions of its two stars Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter. Their characters played important supporting roles on the original film here they take centre stage. The original had Heston's character Taylor at its centre a human in danger from the apes. In Escape...... the roles are reversed with two lovable and deeply human apes in danger from humans. There is however a difference between the two films. The danger to Taylor came largely from ignorance the apes particularly Dr Zaius saw him as a brute beast like the other humans of their planet and refused to listen to the evidence that suggested that he was in fact an intelligent being like themselves. Cornelius and Zira are in danger because of both their human and their nonhuman characteristics. Hasslein knows that they are intelligent beings who seem human and yet are not and hates and fears them for precisely that reason. Just as they pitied and befriended Taylor so they are in their turn befriended by two human scientists who try and save them from Hasslein.There are a couple of inconsistencies between this and the earlier films where the apes' society is shown as being technologically less advanced than ours on a par with sixteenth or seventeenth century Europe. It is not explained how individuals from such a society could have succeeded in repairing and operating a spacecraft. Another inconsistency is that Cornelius and Zira know how the apes came to seize control of the Earth from humans and even state that this story is told in the Sacred Scrolls the holy books of the apes' religion. In Planet of the Apes we are to understand that the Scrolls explicitly deny that humans ever had the powers of speech and reason which is why Zaius is so reluctant to admit that Taylor can speak. These inconsistencies however are not really plotholes as such and are unlikely to worry those who come to Escape....... without having seen its predecessors. Escape....... can be seen as a film in its own right rather than as a mere sequel a film which starts out as a comedy and then turns into a serious thriller as the apes try to escape from their human enemies. Although it is less philosophical than the first film it can perhaps be seen as an allegory of racism as Hasslein's paranoia leads him to treat as enemies those who bear no illwill to him and his kind and whose only crime is to be different from him. It is significant that his name is derived from the German for hate. 610".

With Milo out of the picture the story focuses on the relationship between Cornelius and Zira in ways that were not afforded the opportunity in the two previous films and is filled with tongueincheek episodes inspired by Pierre Boulle's original novel as Cornelius and Zira go around aping 20th century human culture a subtle and clever mockery of our own in an attempt to make themselves fit in to our society.While Cornelius and Zira make themselves at home as cultural celebrities they are being carefully monitored under the watchful auspices of the nefarious Dr. Otto Hasslein played by recognizable character actor Eric Braeden of Young and the Restless fame who listens with great interest to what the talking chimps have to say about where they came from during a Presidential Inquiry and how they managed to arrive in Taylor's spacecraft as Cornelius explains that the capsule was found when it washed ashore and was repaired by Milo  an implausibility which is the film's glaring continuity error since Taylor's spacecraft sunk into the depths of the Forbidden Zone it is a far fetched conclusion that they somehow managed to not only find retrieve and repair it even if they had repaired Astronaut Brent's crashed spacecraft from Beneath which was overlooked as well with engineering far in advance of their own intellectual ape intelligence which Milo only halfunderstood as Cornelius describes it but managed to do so and escape within a very small window of time before the planet was obliterated by the shockwave of destruction catapulting them backwards in time and arriving at roughly the same destination and era as Taylor's original point of departure it could be argued that these narrative inconsistencies support evidence of Hasslein's Observed Time Curve which suggest that a predestination paradox created alternate intersecting timelines as illustrated by the incongruent timeline of events between Conquest and Battle. Nevertheless once you get past the major plot hole and just go with it Escape is a fun and dramatically intense film but is my least favorite second only to the weakest link in the evolutionary Apes chain Battle For The Planet of the Apes.When Zira announces that she is pregnant the film takes a dark and conspiratorial turn when the government realizes the consequence a race of intelligent talking apes will have on the future of our human society. In an effort to protect their newborn Cornelius and Zira find refuge with Armando a sideshow circus entertainer played by the extravagant Ricardo Montalban who gladly welcomes the simian family with open arms but it isn't long before Dr. Otto Hasslein picks up the fugitives' trail and hunts them down in a tragic and inevitable climax that sets up the paradox of the entire Planet of the Apes chronology.".

The writers had to stretch believability in getting the two primary apes of the 1st 2 films into our present times from the future when Earth is destroyed by a doomsday bomb but the first few scenes are almost classic farce disguised as science fiction storytelling. We view our central characters first as 'apeonauts' and then stuck in a zoo followed by a brief turn at celebrity when our populace becomes enamored of the two as the latest fad. The best and most clever thing about this sequel is that it utilizes the already wellknown captivating characteristics of the chimps delightfully performed again by McDowall and Hunter. They're kind of like old friends by this time and seeing them get acquainted with our modernday culture is just good times. It's also a neat reversal on the ape society of the first two films which was visited by aberrant intelligent humans.Things turn grim in the 2nd half as the fad wears off and our leadership begins to take the threat of possible future ape domination rather seriously. The most interesting character becomes the chief human scientist played by Braeden who starts out typically dispassionate but soon reveals an intense personal desire to preserve the human race and society to the point of fanaticism. In his coldly intelligent eyes only he sees the truly apocalyptic threat presented by the chimps' pregnancy. He's the nominal villain but he sees himself as the only one who gives a damn. Some of the sf plot lines regarding time travel are very clever while others are a bit clumsy. It's clever that the two evolved timetraveling chimps may now be the cause of the future timeline ruled by an ape society. But they reveal to have a knowledge of their history that did not exist in the previous two films. Also rather than letting events evolve over a century or more following what happens here the next film accelerates everything to change the world in the next 20 years  see Conquest of the Planet of the Apes.".

It's great.My chief memoryimage of the flick is seeing them the trio of apes being given the Star treatment getting outta a limousine in front of a crowded city street etc. That is very much a part of the flick. It was made in '71 and yeah it really really looks itbut ya gotta like it. William Windom as da Prez is pretty cool too def. a knockoff of hostile Nixon in places I would say.This sets up the next two fine though its both better than them and better than 2 in the run also. I think you can do worse than to sit through this.......12 outta ";

For much of the film the there is a humorous tone. Good performances were turned in by familiar faces Braeden Montalban Mineo. The story despite some holes was quite riveting. I'm looking forward to the fourth installment. The sense of adventure and exploration this time by the apes and the continued presentation of parallels between this fictional world and our world still make for worthwhile viewing. 710.".

Later on  at L.A.C. they become the subjects of a relentless pursuit by the CIA and being helped by two doctors Bradford Dillman and Natalie Trundy who married Arthur P Jacobs and starred various sequels as Zira .This is a good scifi flick plenty of comedy  suspense metaphysical significance with thoughtful reflexion about origin of human being and nuclear catastrophe  though also packs action adventures intrigue and entertainment. In spite of time and being mostly an amusing followup of the former movies  energy remains still and turns out to be an enjoyable sequel full of fantasy and suspense  though with a unsettling and dramatic final . Exciting  clever writing credits by Paul Dehn  though some elements of the screenplay strain credibility to the limit  the imaginative plot is based upon characters created by Pierre Boulle . One of the important attributes of this work are the magnificent acting from the main cast and supporting  Roddy McDowall's distinctive features prove to be recognizable even under marvelous simian makeup . The performers  particularly Kim Hunter who provides the sturdy central pivot the tale surely needs  are pretty good  the superb characters are well drawn and in spite of makeup they are still oddly convincing .

Phenomenal creative makeup by John Chambers as always  he is a firstrate expert such as proved in 'Blade runner Ssss Island of Dr Moreau' among others . Sensational musical score by topnotch Jerry Goldsmith who composed the classic original score . The picture is well produced by Frank Capra Jr and usual Arthur P.

The teaser opening with Cornelius Zira and Milo returning to preset day Earth is captivating. But it's completely undeveloped and what should have been the underpinning for the story becomes a throwaway hook. The big questions raised but unanswered are how did they recover Taylor's ship repair and learn to fly it? Are they here as prophets? What else could they have brought with them? Instead we get a disposable genius character Milo who's quickly strangled by a zoo gorilla.The rest plays like a QuinnMartin crime drama.

Roddy McDowell  Kim Hunter continue their roles as Cornelius and Zira in this film they travel to present day at first they are feared and imprisoned but at their court hearing they become sensations where they are taken from the zoo to a 5 star hotel they are wined and dined and treated like celebrities until Zira falls pregnant then they have to fight for their lives but they have the help of Dillman and his colleague Natalie Trundy. A good entry to the ape saga much better then the 2nd one beneath the planet of the apes but for me the standout in the series is the 1968 classic Planet of the apes. ".

Roddy McDowell  Kim Hunter continue their roles as Cornelius and Zira in this film they travel to present day at first they are feared and imprisoned but at their court hearing they become sensations where they are taken from the zoo to a 5 star hotel they are wined and dined and treated like celebrities until Zira falls pregnant then they have to fight for their lives but they have the help of Dillman and his colleague Natalie Trundy. A good entry to the ape saga much better then the 2nd one beneath the planet of the apes but for me the standout in the series is the 1968 classic Planet of the apes. ";

Both were interesting movies the first was definitely better that offered some reflections on human nature as seen through the eyes of the apes. Generally speaking this third instalment of the series continues to do that  and as in the first two  humanity doesn't come off looking particularly good. In and of itself standing alone this isn't a bad movie. Its basic problem is its lack of originality although the very fact that it created a sequel to Beneath the Planet of the Apes  whose ending did look rather final  counts for something I suppose. Still in many ways this is the mirror image of the first movie. In that of course three human astronauts land on a future earth rules by apes. Here three apeonauts as they're referred to land on a past earth ruled by humans  namely our own well at least the world of 1973. A lot of this is very similar to the original. Cornelius Roddy McDowell who returns in the role after missing Beneath and Zira Kim Hunter essentially take on the roles of the human astronauts in Planet while Drs. Dixon Bradford Dillman and Branton Natalie Trundy are the Cornelius and Zira of this society sympathetic to the apes and wanting them to survive while Dr. Hasslein Eric Braeden is the personification of the evil human who wants to kill these intelligent apes just as most of the apes wanted to kill the intelligent humans of the original. So aside from the ingenious way of resurrecting a series that you would have expected to be finished originality was somewhat lacking. There are a few twists. Overall human society seemed generally kinder to the apes than ape society was to the humans and it's somewhat humorous to watch as at first Cornelius and Zira are feted as celebrities in Los Angeles. Overall though this really does have the feel of the original in reverse.It's not a bad story. It's a bit farfetched to believe that the apes could have not only raised Taylor's spaceship from the original and learned to launch and pilot it given that in the first two movies which seemed to take place over a relatively short span of time the ape society hadn't even invented the internal combustion engine. Yes that's kind of explained by Cornelius' assertion that Dr. Milo who accompanied he and Zira on this journey is a genius well ahead of his time. Obviously! Still that bit of farfetchedness aside this is a reasonable addition to the series an imaginative way of restarting the series and an obvious setup at the end for what would become the fourth instalment in the series Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes. It's just not particularly original in that it's a rerun of the first with the roles reversed. But if you like the series it's enjoyable enough. 610".

It would seem they do so at the cost of Cornelius leaving not much but set dressing.This is not a bad film. It is also not a wonderful film.

But looking back it is easy to see how so many things could have or should have been better.It has a good ending. That I will give it for sure. Most of the actors never seem to deliver lines with any sort of character. Montalban Roddy McDowall Kim Hunter and William Windom obviously excluded from that previous statement.Eric Braedon's performance was abysmal though I did appreciate the way his character was written to doubt himself and the validity of his choices. By doing this am I an instrument of God or am I working against his great plan? and so forth.Certainly not a film for everyone. Certainly not a film I will see again and again and again. But not a terrible film. Worthy of it's rerelease. And hopefully warranting some kind of adaptation by reclusive genius Tim Burton.".

Now for the bad part without giving anything away the climax of the film was very very sad and the ends justifies the means is no answer. What the villain does wrong is not trying to chance history is how he does it. Making peace is more of an answer it's war mongers that will destroy this world bring about the Planet Of The Apes not these gentle strangers from tomorrow.

Hmm well they did something unique in film historythe sequel was also a prequel!! Here's how they did it At the end of the last movie the Earth blew up but somehow our favorite apes Cornelius Roddy McDowell and Zira Kim Hunter both escaped the explosion in a space ship and traveled back in time to 20th century Earth!!! Now this was no small feat as the apes in the previous movies had progressed up to perhaps the 18th century in technology and no others possessed a space ship either! Well this gaping plot hole is one of the reasons this movie only gets a 6. The other is that this movie for the first half of it has absolutely no controversy or excitement. If you like seeing the two apes being wined and dined and interviewed on TV then this movie is for youbut zilch as far as controversy goes.However later under the influence of a truth serum Zira tells the humans that they are from Earth in the future and that humans are either treated as slaves or killed! Well the narrowminded humans want no part of that and decide to sterilize the apes to prevent this horrible future. The problem is that Zira is already pregnant never mind that it seems hardly likely that Roddy McDowell could be the father and they don't want their baby killed! I'm not sure why no one thought about letting the child be born and then sterilizing the threethis could have worked out and prevented a fourth movie.Well our two beloved apes don't want to be sterilized or lose their baby so they escape. While in hiding Zira has the baby and when the human thugs catch up to them they are killedbut not before a DIFFERENT baby is substituted for theirsmeaning that they actually planned on making a sequel to this movie.Decent story writing though with HUGE plot holes good acting and a fun script make this a worthwhile film but certainly weaker than movies number 1 2 and 4.".

	schema:reviewBody "Taking place some 18 years after ESCAPE FROM THE PLANET OF THE APES this fourth chapter in the consistently entertaining series is another good one that benefits from an extra strong performance in the chimp makeup by Roddy McDowall. The actor now assumes the challenging role of his own son Caesar or rather the nowgrown angry but clever offspring of Zira and Cornelius who survived his own assassination attempt at the climax of the previous movie.It's now the year 1991 no not the same '91 that we all experienced but actually an altered version for the next time it comes 'round having been changed by the arrival of Zira and Cornelius and their events of ESCAPE. The world has become different due to a mysterious virus brought back to Earth from the astronauts maybe Zira  Cornelius themselves from their future? as a result dogs and cats have become extinct while apes increase in stature and rate of intelligence and ability to learn. To replace their lost pets a business called APE MANAGEMENT which I presume to be a franchise throughout the world has been established to train gorillas chimpanzees and orangutans to serve humans in their homes as waiters sweepers bedmakers and general servants.Ricardo Montalban is good as a kindly circus owner who brings Caesar into this new environment but the young chimp must be careful not to reveal that he is actually the notorious talking ape who threatened humanity two decades earlier. Yet as Caesar becomes increasingly angrier by the acts of bondage he witnesses among his fellow primates he launches a fullscale riot to overthrow the community and bring humans to their knees. He is motivated by an allconsuming hatred and wages bloody war as the first step possibly to world domination on other continents. And that's just the point  some viewers say that the battle in CONQUEST is on such a relatively small scale that they can't see how the apes would or could take over the world. But if you pay close attention the vengeful Caesar only considers this encounter a beginning not an allout apocalyptic defeat of all of mankind in one night! It's easy to gradually come down on this series as it goes along pointing to the obvious lower budgets and so forth but director J. Lee Thompson does a great job utilizing the futuristic look of the reallife Century City Complex to pull off a feeling of a city out of tomorrow.I won't deny that more money could have made this film even better God knows the pullover ape masks for the extras are certainly obvious but I feel it's McDowall's energetic and intense performance that elevates this to a higher level than its budget alone would allow. Don Murray as the evil governor is perhaps a little too theatrical but Severn Darden is quietly contemptible as his more reserved assistant Kolp who would return in the next and final chapter of the saga. Reportedly preview audiences found the original ending too violent so McDowall was called in to loop more humane lines of dialogue over some nonmatching closeups for the movie's official release. It would be great to see a restored version with the actual ending one day. But even as it stands CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES has more than enough action humor and drama to make it a winner considering it's a fourth sequel.EDITED UPDATE  In 2008 a Bluray Special Edition was released which featured for the very first time the original version of the movie. It features several gruesome bloody and violent moments which were cut out of the Theatrical Version. Also restored was the more downbeat ending.

He leads the charge as the apes revolt and take over apparently planting a seed that could eventually grow into the world we saw in the original PLANET OF THE APES classic.The film again is intelligent and actionpacked. It's true that by today's overblown standards the ape revolt can't look as awesome as it did in 1972...but the focus here is on the character of Caesar an ape from another time who is not responsible for what he is and who has to stifle his anger over the state of his fellow simians and cope with his situation.CONQUEST is good solid science fiction.".

Passable and stirring sciencefiction movie with a first rate Roddy McDowall who plays here the son of the character he first created and special intervention of Ricardo Montalban as kindly circus owner who's hidden him from the humans for long time .

At the ending happens a spectacular  fierce confrontation between a human army ruled by governor and the simians commanded by Caesar .This is an average  lackluster scifi flick plenty of metaphysical significance with thoughtful reflexion about origin of human being  racism  political pursuit apartheid though also packs action intrigue and entertainment . Although several elements of the screenplay strain credibility to the limit the story turns out to be pretty interesting and amusing . It happens a parallelism between US racial tension  Kent State slaughter revolts in York Pennsylvania 1969 and Camden New Jersey  1971 and the events described on the flick . Roddy McDowall's distinctive features prove to be recognisable even under John Chambers' wonderful ape makeup . The performers  particularly Roddy McDowall who provides the sturdy central pivot the tale surely needs  Natalie Trundy and Don Murray are pretty good  the characters are well drawn and in spite of makeup they are still oddly convincing . In spite of time and being mostly a regular followup of the former stories  some moments of energy remain and results to be a B movie full of action battles and suspense . Writing credits by habitual Paul Dehn based on the characters from Pierre Boulle novel  however his screenplay is not just clever and was cut  eliminating some violent revolt scenes and obligated to pacific ending . Nice production design with interior sets taken from Voyage to the bottom of the sea and Time tunnel  produced by Irwin Allen and with great visual effects . One of the important attributes of this work is the magnificent and luminous cinematography by Bruce Surtees who previously did such a good job for Clint Eastwood . Phenomenal creative makeup design by John Chambers a firstrate expert . Fine musical score though imitating sounds from the great Jerry Goldsmith .The picture is lack budgeted by usual Arthur P. Jacobs  producer of whole saga along with 2oth Century Fox . It's full of fury and sound  being professionally directed by J. Lee Thompson during four weeks in Los Angeles  at University and a lavish commercial development  using sometimes a nice visual sense. It's followed by Battle for the planet of Apes and a shortlived TV series in with Roddy McDowall is again on hand as simian to sustain our interest and feeling .".

	schema:reviewBody "Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes is actually a good movie.  One could argue that it's a case of good writing in the face of a pathetically low budget ala Star Trek.  The future city in the film was actually a thennew business complex in L.A. on the verge of completion.  The producers lucked out and got permission to shoot there.  This was good because the studio had alloted said producers a ridiculously low budget something like 1.7 million dollars to make the movie.  The tiny budget especially shows through in the special effects and the props check out the authenticator used to make Ricardo Montalban's character tell the truth to the goverment heavies which looks like a dining room hanging lamp with a blue bulb inside.  Money problems aside Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes is still entertaining and makes some pointed observations about reallife society in the process.  Just overlook the onlyin'72 turtlenecks afros and pushbutton phones with the cords removed.  .".

	onyx:emotionText "Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes is actually a good movie.  One could argue that it's a case of good writing in the face of a pathetically low budget ala Star Trek.  The future city in the film was actually a thennew business complex in L.A. on the verge of completion.  The producers lucked out and got permission to shoot there.  This was good because the studio had alloted said producers a ridiculously low budget something like 1.7 million dollars to make the movie.  The tiny budget especially shows through in the special effects and the props check out the authenticator used to make Ricardo Montalban's character tell the truth to the goverment heavies which looks like a dining room hanging lamp with a blue bulb inside.  Money problems aside Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes is still entertaining and makes some pointed observations about reallife society in the process.  Just overlook the onlyin'72 turtlenecks afros and pushbutton phones with the cords removed.  .";

	schema:reviewBody "On a scale of one to ten this is one of the few perfect tens I've ever given. Roddy McDowell returns to the Planet of the Apes franchise as Caesar known in the previous film albeit briefly as Milo newborn son of Zira and Cornelius. This is the apocalyptic tale of the slavery that eventually leads to man's final end. The cruelty in this film is so harsh so harshly real. This film was returned again and again from the censors. They refused to release it without cuts. The cuts were made and yet still this film feels to me to be one of the most harshly realistic films I've ever seen. I pride myself on my inability to be shocked. Yet this film struck right through all the layers of protection my life has wrapped me in.The riot scenes were so stunningly authentic. One needs not change much to find oneself staring at our own violent past. Let us hope that it will not be as some have feared our future as well.It inspired me. In a very Shakespearean way. The reconditioning camps... the men dressed like soldiers of the Reich... the cruelty... the electrocutions... the conspiracies of men in power...Conquest of the Planet of the Apes was made with a very limited budget. Caesar's prosthetics works were the only high grade appliances in the film. But it works very much with what it had. And it has a finely crafted story. Several steps removed from the rampant idealism of Escape from the Planet of the Apes Conquest deals with the rage that was bound to result from those events. This is a most important metaphor. A most important film.If all films were made with such unrestrained passion with such verve we would all be better off. Also it was interesting to me to watch this film because I as able to see inspiration and how it works between peers. Recently I had the oppurtunity to read George Romero's first draft to Day of the Dead DRASTICLY different from the project that culminated. There were many scenes of the undead legions separated into units red overalls and green overalls learning different skills. Being taught. Very similar in every respect to the ape conditioning sequences in this film. In the end Romero's film works better WITHOUT those sequences but still it is quite interesting to be able to see from whence some ideas spring.Digression aside this is a very potent film. One that teaches us if allowed much about our humanity. Excellent reprisal performance by Ricardo Montalban. Performance by Roddy McDowell of such a high calibre that it makes up for his relative absence in the previous feature.Wonderfully adept script by Paul Dehn. Visionary direction by J. Lee Thompson known for his excellence in his field. Thompson has also been responsible for such highly regarded films as the original Cape Fear and The Guns of the Navarone.I wish there were more films like this more films that just go balls to the wall and are so unabashedly free. This movie is not afraid to be what it is. It makes no apologies for the violence it's heroes are forced to resort to. Nor should it. Sometimes bad things happen. And sometimes good men must take to arms to stop the bad men from taking over.I fear knowing the result. Knowing the new regime is no better than it's predecessor. The true fear of any freedom fighter.This will be a film that I watch over and over and over again.".

The way J. Lee Thompson choreographed the emergence of the apes from around a corner of the Century City Plaza never ceases to amaze me. Tom Scott's underrated jazzavantgarde score is perfect for this sequence. A dissonant chord is heard on the soundtrack North America 1991. First we see one gorilla then another and then another until finally we see an enormous band of them. I think this is one of the best openings in screen history. Later on Scott's music wonderfully captures the sheer violence of the ape rebellion. I can never forget the musical cue for the guard with the flame thrower. I like Caesar's speech at the endeven if the tone was changed. And that crazy matte painting of the skyscraper engulfed in fire even startled my girl friend. A job well done.".

This is not even alluded to in any way.  Had they made reference to or alluded to Bioengineering or the virus having killed all cats and dogs causing this perhaps I would have found it acceptable however they did not explain this even in the slightest.   Mere selective breeding would not permit such rapid change in 20 years.  Since we already have some understanding of evolution such rapid development should have been explained if only in a single sentence.   Note since we have no understanding of backward timetravel it does not need to be explained. Human Behavior  Why knowing what Corneilus and Zira told them about the future would mankind and human government permit the keeping of apes as pets and eventual slaves while increasing their intelligence and capabilities?    I could see if this happened a hundred or more years down the road but 20 years after the intelligent apes arrive from the future and tell how apes rule the planet and subjagate humans mankind is purposely making apes more intelligent and capable.

Conquest is the violent one of the sequels and is all the better for it. Roddy Mcdowall gives his strongest performance as the simmering Caesar on a personal mission to lead his comrades to freedom.

And Tom Scott's bizarre musical score is not the critical final piece of the puzzle it's the corner piece you had no idea even existed.I wouldn't say stay away from this movie especially if you want to see the entire story.

There is only one black character in the whole movie and apart from the Mexican Riccardo Montalbal who appears early on he is the only one shown with any humanity. All the white characters without exception are cruel sadistic and brutal prepared to beat and torture apes at the drop of a hat. No doubt many of the inadequacies of the plot are due to this Apesasoppressedblacks narrative which is hammered in again and again.

That ape is the chimpanzee Caesar born of Zera and Cornelius the two apes that returned from the future in 'Escape from the Planet of the Apes'. Caesar escaped detection for years in a circus the only man who knew he could talk was Armando the circus owner that is until he sees the way that apes are treated in the city and shouts out against it. Armando claims that it was he who spoke and tells Caesar to hide amongst other apes while he sorts things out with the police. Caesar hides amongst a new consignment of apes and is purchased by the governor it is while working in his control room that he learns that Armando has died in custody. He know knows what he must do to end the mistreatment of apes he must start a revolution! Initially with small acts of defiance but soon after with full scale armed insurrection. The question is when he has won will he and his fellow apes be any better than the humans they have overthrown.This film packs plenty of action into its short run time without skimping on plot. The film makes no attempt to disguise the fact that it is an allegory for the evils of slavery nor does it leave us in any doubt that the apes are the good guys in this story the creators even dressed the police in Nazilike uniforms. Roddy McDowall who played Cornelius in the original film returns as his son Caesar in this film and does a good job under the heavy ape make up. Talking of make up it seems less effective than it did in the first two films as then it was possible to believe that somehow the apes had evolved to look how they do here we are expected to accept that these are real apes as they are today and nobody could be fooled for a second that these weren't people in costume. Once one has suspended ones disbelief about that however the story is gripping in a way that leads one to care about the characters.

	schema:reviewBody "Conquest is the least remembered Apes film and the one that receives the least amount of TV screenings. There's the original of course followed by the one with the mutants the one on presentday Earth and Battle the rubbish one. To this end a subtler lowkey picture set in a future Earth 1990s doesn't seem as instantly memorable.Yet in a period where disease has caused the widespread slaughter of farm livestock Conquest has taken on a fresh relevancy. Escape details dog bonfires that purged the land and Conquest takes up this strand.It's superb science fiction. Making a virtue out of its low budget Conquest is carved as a grimy lowkey thriller minimal sets being used to their optimum advantage. Apes only have menial jobs in this time period  painters cleaners shoeshines  and face regular police brutality often for just sitting on the wrong seat or walking on the wrong patch of grass. The parallels are clear to see. Holding up a mirror to the Watts riots of 1965 it comments on the racial situation in a way that a Hollywood movie doing so directly would not have been allowed. This is exactly what science fiction is for using its fantasy trappings to make political statement.Items like the authenticator lean slightly towards pulp SF though generally this is the most mature bleak and realistically coded Apes film. Long has the myth that the sequels are worthless reigned a rumour clearly untrue by the fact that the series lasted for five films. If all the sequels were terrible then they wouldn't have kept on getting made. I put this belief down largely to the awful concluding movie and the lacking TV series because artistically and conceptually Conquest is arguably the greatest Apes film ever made.Definitely the greatest of the sequels any quibbles are minor ones. There's some clunky yet necessary exposition from Ricardo Montalban in the first five minutes and some of the speech making towards the climax is a little trite. When we hate you we're hating the dark side of ourselves Caesar is told. Yet even with a studioenforced overdub of McDowall's final lines to carve a more hopeful ending this is still unsettling powerful and unashamedly violent. It's often difficult to watch which is praise and one can only wonder how much more disturbing it would have been with the intact dialogue and the full riot unedited. Playing the embittered son of Cornelius McDowall really comes into his own with Hari Rhodes's Martin LutherKing persona acting as a counterpoint to Caesar's Malcolm X.Conquest of the Planet of the Apes was set in 1991. In the real world 1991 saw the police beating of Rodney King. Two decades had passed yet little or nothing had changed.".

There's the original of course followed by the one with the mutants the one on presentday Earth and Battle the rubbish one. To this end a subtler lowkey picture set in a future Earth 1990s doesn't seem as instantly memorable.Yet in a period where disease has caused the widespread slaughter of farm livestock Conquest has taken on a fresh relevancy. Escape details dog bonfires that purged the land and Conquest takes up this strand.It's superb science fiction. Making a virtue out of its low budget Conquest is carved as a grimy lowkey thriller minimal sets being used to their optimum advantage. Apes only have menial jobs in this time period  painters cleaners shoeshines  and face regular police brutality often for just sitting on the wrong seat or walking on the wrong patch of grass. The parallels are clear to see. Holding up a mirror to the Watts riots of 1965 it comments on the racial situation in a way that a Hollywood movie doing so directly would not have been allowed. This is exactly what science fiction is for using its fantasy trappings to make political statement.Items like the authenticator lean slightly towards pulp SF though generally this is the most mature bleak and realistically coded Apes film. Long has the myth that the sequels are worthless reigned a rumour clearly untrue by the fact that the series lasted for five films. If all the sequels were terrible then they wouldn't have kept on getting made. I put this belief down largely to the awful concluding movie and the lacking TV series because artistically and conceptually Conquest is arguably the greatest Apes film ever made.Definitely the greatest of the sequels any quibbles are minor ones. There's some clunky yet necessary exposition from Ricardo Montalban in the first five minutes and some of the speech making towards the climax is a little trite. When we hate you we're hating the dark side of ourselves Caesar is told. Yet even with a studioenforced overdub of McDowall's final lines to carve a more hopeful ending this is still unsettling powerful and unashamedly violent. It's often difficult to watch which is praise and one can only wonder how much more disturbing it would have been with the intact dialogue and the full riot unedited. Playing the embittered son of Cornelius McDowall really comes into his own with Hari Rhodes's Martin LutherKing persona acting as a counterpoint to Caesar's Malcolm X.Conquest of the Planet of the Apes was set in 1991. In the real world 1991 saw the police beating of Rodney King. Two decades had passed yet little or nothing had changed.";

	schema:reviewBody "In the nearfuture from where we left off Simian Kind has been enslaved. The evolved ape son of Cornelius and Zira leads a revolution against mankind to emancipate the apes. Conquest of the Planet of the Apes the of should probably be a for now that I think of it is definitely among the better Apes films. Even with various declines in production value budget and writing this entry still maintains enough intelligence to be considered among the good apes installments. Also watching humanity getting their ass handed to them is damn entertaining. I'll often watch this film for that satisfaction alone.Conquest was directed by J. Lee Thompson who went on to direct the fifth and final entry in the franchise. Despite liking this movie overall I'm not completely sold on Thompson's direction foreshadowing perhaps. Throughout the movie there are various elements that felt sloppy. For example there's a jarring cut at the very beginning from a montage with a full musical score to a scene devoid of music at all without bothering so much as to edit the music to fade outreverberate. There's also some bad ADR and a handful of those awkward 70's zoomins but otherwise the cinematography is fine. The photography of the city for example really drives in a tone for the film surrounding the viewer with concrete in virtually every direction. The director also makes a point out of using lots of megaphones and intercoms making this future feel authoritarian and immobile both physically and in their dogmatism.There is however one really potent piece of direction from Thompson and that is the revolution itself. The scenes of revolt were actually modeled after footage of race riots during civil rights movement bringing a kind of violent unnerving reality to this film and a racially charged undercurrent. This film can actually disturb you at times and it's the film's greatest redeeming quality. I should also credit this film with being the secondmost rewatchable Apes movie the first being Rise go figure! which could be attributed to its fast pacingshort runtime. Paul Dehn is the writer for the third film in a row and provides a serviceable amount of intelligence overall despite struggling to keep his act together on smaller details. For example there are a few basic premises the film presents that are hard to suspend disbelief for. Like the virus that wiped out dogs and cats the awkward forced romance between Caesar and Natalie Trundy's Lisa or how Caesar was unaware of enslaved apes until he got to the city. I mean it's pretty convenient that Caesar has been shielded from the reality of enslavedapes for his entire life thus far. That way we can put in extra exposition for the viewer! Small things like just talking about the circus rather than showing it are also a problem. Showing it would have provided a better insight into Caesar's reality and given more emotional weight between him and Armando. I can also see however how that could have come off as silly and it's evident that the budget was dwindling.In the long run you really have to give this film credit for providing a solid foundation for the stellar reboot trilogy about Caesar. Even if Caesar's complexity isn't fully harnessed in this film it implied a very layered character that would eventually be done justice. Caesar at his best is a character study on perspective duality and internal conflict and there is definitely a presentation of those traits in Conquest albeit in a limited form. Also an impressive character is MaCdonald who is not only likable but complex. There's a part of the movie where he talks about being a descendant of slaves and this is where the franchises race allegory looks itself in the face. This kind of philosophy will actually help shape the duality within Caesar.Though the character of Caesar is more complex than Cornelius this is arguably McDowall's lesser portrayal. He doesn't grasp the full extent of Caesars internal isolation conflict and introspection though he does a good job of reflecting Caesar's anger. Ricardo Montalban as Armando is at times shaky and there are times when it sounds like he's reading the script for the first time. That being said he remains charming in his role. Hari Rhodes is stellar as MacDonald and Don Murray does a fine job as Breck. Natalie Trundy as Lisa is clearly uncomfortable in the ape prosthetics and is pretty bad as are many of the ape extras who inversely seem to be overacting.I like the costume design quite a bit since it foreshadows the segregation within the apes' own society. It's a little more minimalistic than the outstanding costume design from the first film but it complements the industrialistic setting well. The makeup here is not at it's best but better than at its worst that works for the whole movie actually. The dreadful pullover masks from Beneath are thankfully gone. There are still lazier ape prostheticsmasks used for the extras when compared to the first film but there's actually effort put in this time to make sure their eyes aren't caved in and hollow. Without a serviceable budget it's inevitable that Chamber's makeup would diminish in quality.The musical score by Tom Scott is actually pretty good. It thrives with a satisfyingly eccentric melodicism making it a worthy gesture in the footsteps of Jerry Goldsmith. Despite an often fickle presentation Conquest manages to ride on a handful of strong merits that retain a level of intelligence in the franchise. I may like this film more than most seeing as how I'm a nihilistic iconoclastic maniac who finds the downfall of humanity highly satisfying there might have been a lessscary way to put that but the film has merits that can be appreciated by anyone nonetheless.Score 7.510".

What that series did expand upon a circular storyline of a film that must surely have been conceived as a one off movie with a twist ending . By the third film of the franchise the producers had moved in to themes of time travel and self fulfilling prophecies that resemble cerebral time paradox that you'd later see in the likes of THE TERMINATOR . The problem with doing this is that you're in danger tying yourself up in knots and painting yourself in to a corner . Certainly I thought CONQUEST a much more entertaining and enjoyable film than RISE which mirrors this film to a large extent but the lack of internal logic is very problematic CONQUEST is set in 1991  almost 20 years after the film was produced and is a future where cats and dogs have died out and apes have replaced canines and felines as pets initially but have now effectively become slaves . The scenario quickly falls apart when given much thought . Is a gorilla a type of pet you'd want ? I'm guessing it's very difficult to keep even if it's toilet trained and a fruit bill alone would make keeping one prohibitive . One fact is that a chimpanzee is the most vile  violent and vicious of primate . An adult male chimp can literally tear a human being from limb to limb so there's no way anyone would want to have one in the same household . It's pointed out to the humans in the previous film that humanity will be replaced by the apes as the dominant species so what does the human race do ?  I know let's breeds millions upon millions of apes  keep them in every city on Earth where they outnumber us because they're cheap labour  I understand both greed and short termism but if anyone had any common sense this problem would be easily averted . I'm certain it'd also be impossible to condition apes in to doing relatively complex tasks but I guess you have to suspend disbelief or otherwise there would be no story This is a shame because Paul Dehn's screenplay does contain rich food for thought . I found this America of the future absolutely fascinating along with the locations that have austere functionalism and are entirely credible . Bad enough about apes but there's a very large elephant in the room where bad things happen to  troublemakers  no questions asked . The fact this type of fascism is specieist rather than racist doesn't make it anymore commendable and the first half of the film is much more compelling than the second as we're shown glimpses of this scenario and allows the actors to give incisive and economical performances with their roles  especially Severn Darden who resists the temptation to do any goose stepping and underplays everything . The second half of the movie concentrates on the Ape revolution and probably isn't violent enough for my liking but I'm guessing I've only seen PG version where much of the violence is excised . It is very noticeable that the fascist militia seem to suffer from tunnel vision and can't see apes creeping up on them from the flanks Despite all the numerous flaws CONQUEST is a fairly enjoyable film and I liked this much better than the remake  reboot  reimagining from 2011 . It does however require turning off your brain in order for the narrative to work and sometimes this is a bit too difficult especially if you remember the internal continuity of the previous and following film".

In this view apes and Africans are liminal creatures simultaneously like and unlike human beings located between nature and civilisation origin and destination. These contradictions have led to the film being labelled either wellmeaning or reactionary pandering to white fears of black uprisings and loss of racial dominance. This after all was a period of time in which some believed that black liberation struggles would threaten the security of white racial hegemony.Regardless Charlton Heston is fittingly cast as our white hero. Heston made a career starring in epics in which Western and nonWestern interests collide. In Gunfighter Nation The myth of the frontier in 20th century America for example cultural historian Richard Slotkin states that the typical Heston character was a hard and selfwilled White male hero an ultra conservative who stands for the highest values of civilisation and progress but who is typically besieged from without by nonwhite savages who greatly outnumber him and beset from within by the decadence corruption and softness of his own society. Indeed in the sixties Heston seemed to be perpetually fighting to defend an outpost on the margins of Western civilisation from barbaric onslaughts The Naked Jungle El City 55 Days at Peking Khartoum etc.Planet of the Apes was brilliantly directed by Franklin J.

Rod Sterling's metaphors are henceforth complicated both the white man and ape at different points of the franchise's timeline represent both white hegemony and persecuted blacks. Apes we then learn were once slaves to humans just as humans are now slaves to apes. The first two films in the franchise also hinge on a big secret the ape society is covering up the fact that human civilisation existed before ape civilisations and that apes are descended from humans. The implication depending how literally you regard the film's dubious apeminority metaphors and reversals is that whites shamefully regard themselves as having evolved from blacks.The next film in the franchise Escape from the Planet of the Apes sees a group of intellectual apes travelling back in time. They arrive on Earth where they are abused by a paranoid military industrial complex which kills them all except for one ape child Caesar.J. Lee Thompson's Conquest of the Planet of the Apes followed. The best sequel in the franchise the film sees a now adult Caesar leading a revolution based on the Watts race riots against a humanity which is attempting to turn apes into slaves.

Next came Battle for the Planet of the Apes again directed by Thompson. Here within a postnuclear society an ageing Caesar struggles to combat ape factions which want to wipe out all of humanity. Caesar in contrast fights for peaceful coexistence. Caesar wins leading to a long period of peace between man and monkey.So each ape film film is built around the conflict between a racially dominant oppressive group and a racially subordinate oppressed group seeking survival harmony or reversal of domination. Each film also presents mediating figures  typically marginalised and at odds with the oppressing group  who intervene in the conflict challenge systems and act as advocates of harmony. The advocates of peace rarely prevail and hostility always results in apocalyptic violence.The ape franchise would be rebooted in 2011 with Rise of the Planet of the Apes. A postracial film Rise's cast is filled with a cocktail of African Americans whites and IndoAmericans. For the first time in the franchise metaphor is replaced by literalism. Here literal apes are literally rebelling against the literal animal cruelty chemical testing directed against them by literal scientists. Typically mis?read in light of postfinancial crisis protests the film ends with apes led by Caesar escaping their cages for the trees of local forests.

In the not too distant future 1991 so don't worry it didn't happen a mysterious disease has wiped out all cats and dogs so apes are kept as replacements pets but are soon found to be more suitable for slave labour and as such are ruthlessly exploited by their human overlords in a gritty dystopian setting. The son of former 'future apes' Zira and Cornelius dubbed Caesar played by Roddy McDowall who previously performed Cornelius as well by his human surrogate father all too small part for Ricardo 'Khan' Montalban finds himself without his protector who is viciously brutalized and killed by the human regime  it's not an all too happy future for humans either  after which he finds himself amongst his fellow simians and becomes their Messiah. Under Caesar's command the apes rise in revolt and violence sweeps the nation as they fight for their freedom and start a conflict that will change the fate of the world. Easily the most controversial and most violent entry into the franchise as the provocative display of abused and chained apes evokes haunting imagery of human slavery based on racial segregation which is of course a parallel that has driven the continuing overall plot since the first film but is most effectively fleshed out here. It is also painfully reminiscent of the race riots of the late sixties and early seventies something the writers sure were aware of. Despite its convincing and intriguing social parallels the fairly limited budget and resulting small scale look of the film hinder the impact of the story on a visual level for looking so cheap. Plus the clear delineation between good apes and bad humans makes for pretty twodimensional oversimplified characterization. The plot was partially appropriated to great acclaim by the latest Planet of the Apes reboot Rise of the Planet of the Apes 2011 thankfully resulting in grander imagery.".

There's one thing I never completely thought about till the last time I saw it only days ago  practically the last moment of the story apart from the crying statue does something that almost deflates the message of these movies  after all the endless strife between the apes and humans in these stories the last thing you see is the little ape jokingly pulling the hair of the little girl. So even in the sequels not just the original which does get credit for this the writers didn't really take the whole thing TOO seriously.".

The money allocated to Leonard Rosenman's impressive score was well spent. The pop singer Paul Williams display a deft touch for acting in his debut.

Some of you might already know this and hence think I'm dumb .. OK others might disagree with me .. also OK but this is intended for those of you who had the same viewpoint on the series as I previously did.I had thought that the films III IV and V had simply explained events prior to the first movie but after seeing Battle again I saw that the past had been changed due to the apes going back in time after the destruction of the earth. Here are my reasons and the evidence grows stronger as episode 3 progresses to episode 5 Episode 3  In the timeline before episode 1 no talking apes had arrived in the 20th century therefore the past has already begun to change. Cornelius claims an ape named Aldo had been the one who first spoke the word 'No' to his masters. He also revealed the plague of cats and dogs was in another century than the 20th I forget which.Episode 4  The plague of cats and dogs has already taken place  the bacteria obviously having been brought back from the future by the 3 apes in the spacecraft. Cornelius' son is the ape to give rise to revolution  not Aldo as he had claimed in part 3.Episode 5  The entire film can basically be forgotten except for the ending. The battle scene is particularly useless having been more like an endofepisode fight from the ATeam rather than a battle for the destiny of a planet. However we end with the statue of the lawgiver as Caesar a chimpanzee and not one of an orangutan as shown in the first two movies. We also see ape and human children sitting side by side as equals which is perhaps the biggest hint.For me this put the series into a new perspective and I appreciate it more now. What had previously appeared to be inconsistencies between episodes turned out to be intended differences.Any comments on the above are most welcome  agree or disagree or just call me stupid for not realising this is blatantly obvious to the rest of you! I apologise in advance for any factual errors I have made due to this being all from memory and no references being consulted.".

It had the lowest budget of all of the films in the series and it painfully shows and looks more like it's a madeforTV movie. In fact it feels almost like a pilot for the Planet of the Apes Television Series.The film begins in the year 2670 and is bookended with John Houston as the revered ape Lawgiver reading from the sacred scrolls like a bedtime storyteller. From here the story is told in flashback and the viewer is left scratching their heads by the befuddling logic. Events not clearly explained are left to the viewer to make assumptions or draw conclusions about the contradictory order of events. It must be assumed that a nuclear war had devastated the Earth immediately after the ape uprising in Conquest and somehow only a decade afterward the ape society had unbelievably evolved their verbal powers of speech and intelligence. These facts are inconsistent with Cornelius' explanation of the apes' evolution in Escape in which he explains that the plague that destroyed all cats and dogs occurred some 200 years later than it did in Conquest and that Aldo was the first ape to utter human speech when he said the word No which was spoken by Lisa in Conquest and that Aldo led the revolt against the humans which was led by Caesar. We can only conclude that the incongruent events in Conquest and Battle are the events of an alternate timeline forged by the creation of the temporal paradox from Cornelius and Zira's arrival in Escape. The apes also adorn costumes similar to the fashions of the ape society from the first film which had evolved over several thousand years but again this is only a decade after their revolt against the humans one explanation could be that since this story is told as a flashback to ape and human children we are seeing it as depicted by their imaginations as a point of reference. MacDonald in this film is not the same MacDonald who was the Governor's Adjutant in Conquest but rather his brother which is confusing since Caesar appeared to have found a human sympathizer and ally in the MacDonald from Conquest and the only reasonable explanation for the deliberate change of character is that MacDonald is played by a different actor this time but if you aren't paying close attention you are likely to miss that inference. Ape City is located in a very lush and hospitable forest area within miles of the inhospitable desert wasteland of the annihilated Forbidden City. Automobiles such as jeeps and school buses still work somehow and were not rendered inoperable by the EMP of the atomic detonation. Radioactive halflife apparently only affects the surviving humans living within the irradiated remains of the Forbidden City and the apes can somehow sustain bombardments of high levels of radioactive fallout for a few hours while they search its archives for a videotape of Cornelius and Zira which also amazingly happened to not be vaporized or magnetically degaussed by the atomic blast. The mutated humans all wear skull caps for the purpose of take your pick A. protecting their craniums from high radiation levels B. to hide the fact that their hair has completely fallen out due to radioactive fallout C. to enhance telepathic reception of their nowsuddenly mutated telekinetic minds or D. All of the above.The newly restored scenes with the human mutants and the AlphaOmega bomb at least help to make some sense of the rather weak narrative and gaps of logic and provide some continuity to the rest of the series. These scenes are significant because it shows the mutants beginning to hone their developing telepathic powers and it establishes the fundamental doctrine of their quasireligious sect that will worship the AlphaOmega bomb in future generations. It almost feels more like a direct prequel to Beneath now. Why this subplot was excised is almost as baffling as the film's logic but one reason perhaps is the fact that the film ends with a more optimistic outlook suggesting that the timeline of events were changed when Caesar united the apes and the humans and that the crisis of Beneath may have been averted but it is left open for the audience to decide from the ambiguous tear of the weeping statue of Caesar suggesting that perhaps the fateful events of the future cannot be avoided after all.Battle is definitely the worst of the five apes films but compared to most lowbudget scifi shlock I've seen it's really not as bad as it's made out to be but judged against the superior standard set precedent by the first film it is a quite a disappointment. In addition to the restored scenes there are few highlights that make the film worth at least a viewing if you have enjoyed watching the other films in this series at all. Of particular interest are the sets of the melted down postapocalyptic Forbidden City that are just visually interesting to look at even if the obvious matte paintings were composited into the background. It gives the film a futurecoda feel in a way that evokes images of James Cameron's The Terminator but predates it over a decade. If nothing else Battle was at least influential in inspiring other science fiction films in the genre and was the template for subsequent franchises and was more than influential to George Lucas and his Star Wars megamerchandising empire that would follow only a few years later and the Planet of the Apes series would forever be buried under its apocalypse and reside in the realm of Saturday afternoon and latenight television broadcasts.".

However there was one final film for the original series to go and they actually managed to come up with a credible reason for a followup. It was NOT so easy to make movie 3 as the Earth had just blown up and no logical reason could resurrect the series so in the 3rd film they came up with a totally illogical reason!.This film was set only a few years after the fourth film CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. Unexpectedly the new society that Caesar set up after the last film was pretty egalitarian and the humans were not all confined to become slavesthough there were a lot of rumblings from the gorillas who for some odd reason carried a grudge after being tortured and enslaved by the humans! One serious flaw with the film though is that although this only takes place perhaps a decade later all the apes are civilized and can talk use guns etc. as well as any of the humans! I am a school teacher and I only PRAY that I get students this smart!! Anyways back to the review. It turns out that although this society is functioning pretty well not all the humans have fallen to the apes. Nope. Ignorant and nihilistic humans STILL hold out hopes of wiping out the basically decent apes and reasserting mankind's hold over the planet. Well without getting into the complex plot the film boils down to a final battle with the bad humans. The apes win but in the process the evilness of the gorillas is exposed as they murder Caesar's son! It seemed the bad gorillas SHOULD have teamed up with the bad humans after all!! The film concludes leaving the viewer to ponder what will become of the perfect ape societywill it actually degenerate to what it would become in movie 1 or would all the positive changes in this movie avert that awful future and the destruction of the Earth?!? I guess we'll never know.The first time I saw this movie I didn't like it very much. However in seeing it again it had a good plot acting and was a worthy conclusion to the series.A few points in conclusion it was cool to see the singer Paul Williams as an ape in this movie it probably took less makeup than usual there was a shortlived TV series that followed and if anyone thinks the remake from 2001 was great is an idiot.".

The central plot revolves around the ancient Ape theory that Ape should not kill Ape just as in real life worlds Humans should not kill Human.

To me it would have been far better if they had never made any sequels the original movie was on a far higher level than the sequels ever aspired to. It was a ci9nematic masterpiece which I can't praise highly enough. I hated Beneath...it was hammy boring and dull with some badly judged humour and really could have been made without any actors in ape makeup just a standard adventure. Escape had its moments veering from cringe inducing slapstick to dark moments of intelligence and Conquest is certainly depressing but badly misguided. Then came Battle. To be honest it looks like a tv movie has no cinematic scale or visual ambition. What it does possess is compassion which the other films lack. It tries to end the series in diminuendo and for me works. The insight into the middle stage between human and ape is fascinating and the gorillas have the menace again they lacked totally in Beneath. The most fascinating aspect is the ape has killed ape subplot which is a great piece of moral soulsearching big budget or not. Lord Of The Flies seems to have invaded the concept somewhere and the movie is pensive and reflective and the ending is gorgeous. The allegorical tone of the first film is returned albeit very heavy handed but the chimp gorilla conflict and the school war games mixtures made for me a very sensible way of closing the book at long last. It's the only sequel I would dash home to watch of them all. I guess you might say they just joined the human race.".

	schema:reviewBody "People have massacred this film criticizing its choppy length its performances and its special effects. But I say bravo to J. Lee Thompson for it the man who failed so miserably at Conquest of the Planet of the Apes.Caesar Roddy McDowall returns as does Lisa Natalie Trundy his chimpanzee wife and Aldo now played by Claude Akins a gungho gorilla who constantly dreams of getting rid of Caesar.

The strangest thing in it is that it is in a way the sequel of what precedes but since it is supposed to be what precedes what was shown at the beginning there is a gap that is ununderstandable. It ends with apes and humans being equal and living together but in the first film one thousand years later the humans had run wild had lost the power to speak and were nothing but fun game for the apes or decoys for the gorilla ape army. In other words the loop does not close we are missing one link and a big one. Too bad this series of five films will have no extra episode to explain the shift. There sure is a remake but that is for tomorrow. Why has that film or those films had such a tremendous success since the Planet of the Apes has become a sibylline and enigmatic motto in the minds of those who believe in the regression of man and in the progress of all animal species? It probably has to do with the period when it was done the last 78 years of the Vietnam war the time of the near impeachment and final resignation of a President the Watergate scandal the doubt and the uncertainty of a giant that had let's say transit problems and could not find the proper coal to pacify it. The questions are serious but the treatment of them is simple direct understandable even by children. It is a series of film done for families and that could be enjoyed including in its simple humane principles without real heavy discussion or thinking. Simple principles of liberty equality pursuit of happiness and life. Simple principles and objectives like education and science and trust. And those who did not like the symbolism of the apes could not even derisively laugh at it because then they would appear narrow minded and bigoted. So they can only make it into a motto that is at least double entendre and has at least double meaning. That's like in the Planet of the Apes with a sneer or a smile a giggle or a laugh and a big slap in the back or a tap on the shoulder and everyone gets the meaning they want in the catchphrase punch line or rebuttal without ever really knowing what is the meaning the person who uttered the sentence actually wanted to mean. That's why it is interesting to watch these films again because they are the lasting testimony to a past period in history and because they are still rather arcane and inscrutable. Enjoy this last episode before the remake and if you have patience get the DVD of extras and watch them all. 126 minutes of documentary.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University Paris 8 Saint Denis University Paris 12 Crteil CEGID".

	schema:reviewBody "A point raised by Caesar's enemy Kolp Darden in a mustachetwirling snidely elegant turn at maddened villainy in this 5th and final Apes film. But a king usually has more than one enemy as Caesar finds to his grief. A predictable and mostly logical followup to the previous Conquest of the Planet of the Apes this one like Beneath the Planet of the Apes stresses scifi action rather than any deep themes related to slavery or culture shock. Several years after a nuclear war we find a surprisingly peaceful yet primitive village occupied by both apes and humans governed by chimp Caesar McDowall who began a revolution in the previous film as a young radical. Now much older  either about 10 or 30 years older depending on various sources  he projects a benign fatherly personality. It's not quite paradise though not the slaves as apes were previously humans have shifted to 2ndclass citizens despite an image of equality and tension escalates due to local bully gorilla Aldo Akins  'call me by my proper rank General huh!'. Then Caesar himself opens the door to other possible problems by visiting a nearby nuked city obviously the same one from the previous film. There the human governor from Conquest... has been replaced by his security chief Kolp who was bad enough as 2nd in command  now he's bored just sifting through the rubble with his few mutated followers  time to work off the doldrums and teach a clever ape how to show respect.This entry is generally regarded as the worst of the 5 films if most fans had to pick one but it's not a complete waste by comparison. There really is a battle at the end a miniwar between the invading mutants and the village  but then the final confrontation between Caesar  Aldo is slow going. This film is almost like a precursor to all of those post holocaust scifi pieces in the eighties Steel Dawn etc.. The biggest weakness is that nothing really new is added to the saga. The new character Virgil Williams for example is a genius orangutan but he's a retread of the genius chimp from Escape... What this film does really is bring things full circle for the 5film saga though not in a very creative way. As with the previous film Conquest... events that should occur over the course of decades or centuries are depicted in the span of days. The filmmakers got all the old costumes from the first 3 films out of mothballs and outfitted the apes here the same way against logic. The mutated humans from the bombed out city are the ancestors of the mutants we've seen in Beneath...  they even show the alphaomega bomb which though almost detonated here remains as is until it supposedly destroys everything in two millennium. However a prologue and epilogue set about 600 years from now with the orangutan Lawgiver Huston shows that the future is not set so now we're left guessing. This movie was followed by the short lived TV series which took place about a thousand years in the future.".

Apes are now the superior race yet rely on them to teach the Apes grammar and such.

A general by the name of Aldo seems to harbor visions of seizing control of the Ape civilization and directing it in a way much different than Caesar.Caesar verbalizes his wish to have heard some words of wisdom from his long deceased parents Cornelius and Zira.  McDonald says it is so since the parents were under surveillance upon their coming to 1970's Earth and that filmed records exist as to the revelations about the future of the Earth. Caesar immediately organizes a party of himself Virgil and McDonald to visit the Forbidden City which is radioactive due to the fallout of the nuclear war to learn about his parents.  They go to the archives and find the records they were seeking.  Yet meanwhile there was a group of survivors that lived in the forbidden city that found out that Caesar was there.  These humans were terribly disfigured due to the vast nuclear fallout.  They recognize Caesar right away and want to gain vengeance for their fate.  Caesar and his entourage flee from the Forbidden City once the Human Mutants go after them.Anything past this will spoil the ending.

There's a forbidden city not too far from here that has an archive and in that archive is some footage of your mom and pop doing some interviews and stuff. Wanna check it out? Caesar Cool let's go! And it's all downhill from there. Two major cities less than a days ride apart and no one knows that the other exists or is populated? Give me a break. When the forbidden city army came rolling out of their ruins in an old dilapidated school bus and a couple of jeeps left over from the old Rat Patrol series I just about keeled over in hysterics. Did those cool goggles man. I suffered so much brain damage from this film that I find it difficult to continue. An armory made of sticks protected by an elderly ape who administers logic tests to separate the riff raff from the honest weapon seeking populace? A mutant club whose only requirement is that you have a scar? Any scar. Anywhere. Any size. And don't forget those ruby goggles. When the mutants first open fire on a pair of apes it reminded me of something out of Monty Python. The shell explodes right between the two guys who are about 6 feet apart and when the smoke clears they're still standing! A quick follow up shot takes care of those pesky apes for good. The battle such as it is is a dismal failure. More of a squad of soldiers trying to secure a choke point than a battle for a planet. Things do go boom there's some dirt flying in the air and a lot of extras running around screaming but that's about it. There's an extremely heavy handed comeuppance of a murderous ape and even a weeping statue at the end but not one shred of redemption for the time you just wasted watching this piece of trash. I can only wonder why Roddy McDowall agreed to participate in this tragedy unless he was forced to do so under contract with penalty of execution by firing squad if he refused. Here's a suggestion Grab your kid's dolls dress 'em up like apes and make your own final ape movie. It's gotta be better than this.".

Sure it's easily the least of the five movies but it's still entertaining and has something to say which is a quality that's usually missing with most fifth entries of a long franchise and definitely in science fiction films in general these days.It's now some years after the events of CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES and we learn that much has happened in the interim most importantly man must have pushed a panic button during the subsequent ape wars as much of the Earth or at least the North American section of it has become radioactive wasteland thanks to the detonation of some kind of bomb. BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES centers on one small community of survivors  who are not necessarily supposed to be considered the entire world population as so many detractors mistake when they like to condemn its small budget  but just a relatively modest group of apes and humans in one specific area who try to rebuild their lives in peace. Can it ever be done?Roddy McDowall returns as Caesar who is more benevolent than he was in CONQUEST but still has trouble completely trusting humans at this point in time  and even as he grows to learn some apes! Probably due to that plague that befell the world decades ago the simians are still increasing in speech and intelligence at an incredible rate. While apes are the dominant species in this particular neighborhood humans are treated with at least a moderate amount of respect except by selfappointed gorilla general Aldo Claude Akins who would prefer to exterminate all of mankind instead of tolerating them.There's still a point to the series although by now it has reached the level of repetition  will man and ape ever be able to survive together as equals? Not only do Aldo and his gorillas despise the humans of their own village but a group of mutated human survivors from the old city are still alive and vow to wage war on Caesar's tranquil little town. It should also be noted that there was a very poignant subplot originally filmed which involved the mutants and their devotion to an AlphaOmega bomb making these beings the likely ancestors of the ones we'd later see in BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES. Without these scenes the film isn't as intelligent as it might have otherwise been and as of this writing the footage has only been made available on a Japanese laserdisc.I think the casting was wonderful this time around. I mean was Claude Akins perfect for a gorilla general or what? And Paul Williams was a natural for his part as Virgil the wise little orangutan. John Huston as the Lawgiver and Lew Ayres as Mandemus were also interesting choices.Yes again the money was still tight for this chapter so those expecting a huge blownout full scale war should be advised that it's more along the lines of ... well a battle. The movie is supposed to take place in a barren scantily populated wasteland why so much more money was thought to be needed under those circumstances is beyond me.As a big fan of the APES films I waited almost 30 years for Twentieth CenturyFox to revisit this series. There were still plenty of possibilities that could have been explored what other forms of life and civilizations still existed in other locations throughout America? Whatever happened to apes and people over in the other countries? Apparently none of that mattered to Fox. Like many I guess they just don't get  this saga. Instead when they finally got around to making another film it was yet another needless reimagining that was rushed out with no idea as to what made these films so engaging to those who liked them in the first place.  out of ".

Regardless I noticed something was missing. I distinctly remember a scene in this film after the apemutant war and after the apes and humans agree on equality in their society that depicted Mendez and the woman of Asian descent in the Forbidden City playing chess. She looks at her watch or a clock and announces that 72 hours have passed and she has not received Kolp's signal. As per Kolp's orders she is now going to launch the nuclear missile at Ape City. Mendez talks her out of it telling her that the missile is the AlphaOmega Bomb and will destroy not just the ape city but the world. He tells her that Kolp got what he asked for and that they should stay together and guard the bomb in peace and thus talks her out of it while laying the groundwork for the cult of mutant bomb worshippers we see in Beneath. This scene has been cropped out for some reason. It's a shame as it really helped with the series' continuity. If any of us are alive in 2067 I'm sure the studio will put it back in for the 100th anniversary slipcased edition they release. Or whenever they think it will be profitable.

Lee Thompson this was the fourth  final sequel to the original Planet of the Apes 1968 recently released on DVD  Bluray in a ten minutes longer than the original theatrical version 'Director's Cut' it's this longer 96 minute version that I will be basing my comments on. The film  it's continuity isn't that great but it's sort of fun in a silly scifi action sort of way although within the space of ten years since Conquest of the Planet of the Apes there's been a nuclear war that has wiped out humanity  the Apes have learned to speak plus the ending in which Ape  human seem to coexist in harmony is definitely at odds with the future that is clearly set out in the original two Planet of the Ape films  maybe it's no great surprise in retrospect that Battle for the Planet of the Apes turned out to be the last one. Although Battle for the Planet of the Apes does alter some continuity it retains some as it sets up the whole mutant human race  the atomic bomb plot from Beneath the Planet of the Apes 1970  it refers to previous character's such as Zira  Cornelius. The film moves along at a decent pace there's some alright if workmanlike action scenes  it's watchable but the dialogue which seems to try  have character's say something profound every time they open their mouth's is badly written. The whole role reversal is here again too as the makers try to point out humanities flaws with the story like the dangers of war  not to put animals in cages  stuff like that.The makeup effects look cheap here as the executives at Twentieth Century Fox kept cutting the budget of each subsequent Planet of the Ape film the original Planet of the Apes had a budget of nearly six million while by the time Battle for the Planet of the Apes was made it had a budget of less than two million. The battle scenes are rather flat  sure there's a few explosions  some gunfire but nothing terribly exciting or particularly well shot.With a supposed budget of about 1800000 this looks alright but nothing amazing. Roddy McDowall again stars but this time as Caesar who is the son of Cornelius who he played in the previous films. Oscar winner John Huston has a cameo while future director John Landis has a small role early on in his career.Battle for the Planet of the Apes isn't a total disaster  if you like the franchise then this is worth seeking out even if your not it does have a few good moments  it entertains although the heavy handed morals can get tiresome as in the rest of the series.".

	schema:headline " And the Oscar for this year's strangest film goes to...";
	schema:reviewBody "'It's All About Love' is a true oddity. It feels almost like someone recorded all the strange ideas that came into their head for a week and chose a common topic i.e. 'Love' and wrote a screenplay from their notes.But that's not to say it's a bad movie.In truth I quite enjoyed it although I came out of it feeling like I'd woken up from a dream or possibly a nightmare.It's quite unsettling.The plot is both incredibly simple and incredibly complexJohn Joaquin Phoenix goes to New York to get a divorce from his famous figure skating wife Elena Claire Danes. While he's there he notices that Elena seems to be in the middle of a vast conspiracy and together they try to escape it rediscovering their love at the same time.The film is set in the near future although it doesn't really need to be. I like the future in this film because it's not radically different except for flying Africans...go figure but feels like twenty odd years from now. In the near future people who are lonely or suffer a great loss will often drop dead. And the people of the near future merely walk over their bodies.John and Elena are Polish although they don't need to be. It adds certain poignancy two foreigners not quite in place in a world that keeps putting them out of place. Joaquin Phoenix and Claire Danes while both very good I think...it's hard to tell in a film as strange as this could possibly have used some accent work. At times they speak with no accent at all and it seems to distract.On that note I would like to point out how brilliant Claire Danes is. Ever since I saw Brokedown Palace I have been astounded by her acting ability although that said she doesn't do heartwrenching crying very well. I won't spoil it but under the circumstances of what happens to her characters she's incredible.Also thrown into the mix is Sean Penn playing John's brother. I honestly couldn't see why he was in the movie except maybe to oversee all the weather changes think a far more subtle low budget Day After Tomorrow with more meaning. For instance it snows in New York in July and there are days when all the fresh water freezes I'm not saying it's a bad point but another end that wasn't loose but still needed tightening.As I mentioned the plot is incredibly complex. It twists a fair bit until it seems to cut all things loose and start a new movie some twenty minutes before the ending. Still another way this movie unsettles me.Visually the film is stunning. It looks like a far more mainstream film than it obviously is. And while the film is beautiful it still feels hard to watch like there's something dreaded under the gloss.If this reads as an ambiguous review that's probably a good thing. I like this movie quite a lot. But I also dislike it. It's easy to see why the DVD cost me 10. I also like the fact that I own this movie before America even get an official release date. As an Australian always open to release dates getting pushed back by three months or movies being on DVD in America for about a year before we even get a theatrical release this gives me a strange sense of superiority.An incredibly strange movie and most certainly not everyone's cup of tea I'll have to be careful of who I recommend this movie to. But see it yourself as it's a movie that deserves an audience just a very select one.710".

	onyx:emotionText "'It's All About Love' is a true oddity. It feels almost like someone recorded all the strange ideas that came into their head for a week and chose a common topic i.e. 'Love' and wrote a screenplay from their notes.But that's not to say it's a bad movie.In truth I quite enjoyed it although I came out of it feeling like I'd woken up from a dream or possibly a nightmare.It's quite unsettling.The plot is both incredibly simple and incredibly complexJohn Joaquin Phoenix goes to New York to get a divorce from his famous figure skating wife Elena Claire Danes. While he's there he notices that Elena seems to be in the middle of a vast conspiracy and together they try to escape it rediscovering their love at the same time.The film is set in the near future although it doesn't really need to be. I like the future in this film because it's not radically different except for flying Africans...go figure but feels like twenty odd years from now. In the near future people who are lonely or suffer a great loss will often drop dead. And the people of the near future merely walk over their bodies.John and Elena are Polish although they don't need to be. It adds certain poignancy two foreigners not quite in place in a world that keeps putting them out of place. Joaquin Phoenix and Claire Danes while both very good I think...it's hard to tell in a film as strange as this could possibly have used some accent work. At times they speak with no accent at all and it seems to distract.On that note I would like to point out how brilliant Claire Danes is. Ever since I saw Brokedown Palace I have been astounded by her acting ability although that said she doesn't do heartwrenching crying very well. I won't spoil it but under the circumstances of what happens to her characters she's incredible.Also thrown into the mix is Sean Penn playing John's brother. I honestly couldn't see why he was in the movie except maybe to oversee all the weather changes think a far more subtle low budget Day After Tomorrow with more meaning. For instance it snows in New York in July and there are days when all the fresh water freezes I'm not saying it's a bad point but another end that wasn't loose but still needed tightening.As I mentioned the plot is incredibly complex. It twists a fair bit until it seems to cut all things loose and start a new movie some twenty minutes before the ending. Still another way this movie unsettles me.Visually the film is stunning. It looks like a far more mainstream film than it obviously is. And while the film is beautiful it still feels hard to watch like there's something dreaded under the gloss.If this reads as an ambiguous review that's probably a good thing. I like this movie quite a lot. But I also dislike it. It's easy to see why the DVD cost me 10. I also like the fact that I own this movie before America even get an official release date.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't think I really spoil the film considering the flying Ugandans are my only direct reference. But just in case...My comments are more general and hopefully helpful if you're thinking about seeing the film. If you're looking for fastpaced action this is too leisurely and curious a pace. If you're not in the mood to be intrigued without explanation then save this one for when you are! I don't know you so I don't know if you'll like it! I can't even say for myself but to have you read my thoughts... I think I liked it.What got me here writing to you is those darned flying Ugandans! Being just a tad OCD I couldn't not read all the comments in hopes of finding some kind of insight on this film and it's peculiar end image....I do recommend you read the director's explanation of this film at www.cinema.com Also quoted in one of the comments. This is a helpful view to keep in mind! I can't say I'm a film buff nor am I as wellread as some of the others who've commented. Just as well here's my 2...THE ACCENT As far as I understand the characters portrayed by Phoenix and Danes are supposed to be Polish. The accent thing is mildly annoying. Only that it caused some struggle in me to understand if the characters were Polish Russian or Americanized Polish etc.THE ACTING Moderate. Difficult to accuse the actors script director etc. It seems to vary with how it's received. And given the bizarre nature of the film no one character struck me as having been BADLY acted.VISUAL ART Definitely! Beautiful and well crafted. Tone rhythm perspective harmony... Very detailed and constructive.DIALOGUE I tend to agree that the dialogue was weak. Mostly because I felt I had to focus so much and barely comprehend! What intrigued me most was how much attention I'd compelled in hopes of discovering... something!FIGURE SKATING I'm a fan. But the entourage is exaggerated. It is an international sport. And it doesn't seem to really be of consequence whether or not it's ever going to be that big of a sport! It's just the way the movie goes. So go with it! Otherwise the lack of athleticism displayed or who'd ever care about figure skating will really get you going!GENRE Certainly I found myself trying to fit the film as it unfolded into a genre I already understood. And I was thwarted at every turn! It seemed a journey that was purely in my mind as well as an emotional exploratory. And I think the idea of printing a dream fits best.MY THOUGHTS This film really gets under your skin yea or nay! Whether you hate it or love it or somewhere in between that fact that you've gone so far as to read this comment already invokes some kind of meaning. Providing you've also seen it! I saw this last night on the Sundance channel. I'd like to see it again to find my opinion. But for now it seems the most settling explanation is that I've just viewed someone else's dream.Dreams often don't make sense to the dreamer but do have some kind of plot as you are dreaming it! No character is immutable. So the weakness of character may be just that... an everchanging character to suit the moment? And dreams are often of the subconscious andor unconscious. Things we have a opinion concern or feelings about but not yet thoughtout. So the anachronistic view feels like fragments of ideas trying to become something effable.I like that it is provoking... thoughts emotions etc. Definitely an interesting topic of conversation on many levels. What you think feel and say are personally revealing if you explore it like a dream. And fun to share especially about those silly scenes and the ideas that just can't be helped.... The best part is how heartily I can laugh at the silly scenes and the collective WHAT? that we all share. I feel the need to know! So those discontinuous points and lapse in plausibility or plain nonsense did bug me. WHY? WHY? WHY? But again as a dream I guess we should be asking ourselves why we have these questions eh?All in all I can't say I'm coming up with much I didn't like. It was darned weird! But I didn't feel like it was a waste of time. I could have switched the channel or turned it off but didn't. The weirdness level was entertaining in itself! Like enjoying your own dream then finding disappointment that you've awaken ...just because! And reading about it was even more fun! The best part is all the intrigue about those flying Ugandans!!! I'll buy it as a dream. If anyone has insights about the flying Ugandans please feel free to share!But based in reality I can't help but wonder why the laws of gravity only affect the people of Uganda and not the objects and animals. Why the Ugandans? Where were the Chinese folks in the world of 2021? What happens when the neverlanding plane flies over this selective zerog area? Every other nonsensical is quite viable in dreamstate. But those tethered flying Ugandans...what does that mean?! Freud? Jung? Anyone?How about Inability to see the global impact via prevention of floating or flying in dreamstate? ...Or those wanting to see truth but are somehow tied to a fictitious or contrived alternate reality? Or perhaps it's the exit button in the dreamstate? Any takers? oI give it 7 out of 10 because I liked it more than I disliked it. A curious nature will tend to like it. If you want an explanation or simple summary you'll likely NOT like it!".

	schema:headline " Did John kill Elena?";
	schema:reviewBody "My second time watching the movie I picked up a lot more than I did the first time. The ending in particular seemed more tragic the second time through because I noticed that John may have been able to save Elena. Maybe not from the apocalypse but from her disease of the heart. I might be seeing hints where none exist however if you pay close attention to the acting and narrative in the film you may notice what I am talking about. Just another warning this part contains huge spoilers. Read this after you see the movie!Evidence that John could have saved ElenaWhen John first meets the clones the one with the knife screams You killed her! This line caught my attention since it could be foreshadowing that he does kill her later in the film. Marciello Sean Penn says on the plane something along the lines of John you can save her. Kiss her John. Could this be hinting that kissing her would cure or ameliorate her heart problems? Relating to the previous comment notice that through their whole trek through the winter forest not once do they kiss. After Michael leaves he dies very quickly in an extremely heavy blizzard. It is clear that what he really dies from is his heart problem. He is cut off from everyone he loves. Elena and John have abandoned him he is rejected by the rest of his family and he is feeling a horrible sense of guilt for his betrayal. After he dies we cut to a scene of Elena and John who are dancing on the ice. They are both happy the scene is serene and the weather is almost perfectly calm. The question then is why didn't Elena and John both perish in the same storm that Michael died in? The reason may be that the storm and cold are somewhat subjective. In other words the storm may vary from person to person depending upon the condition of their heart. It may even be that those dead on the street experienced the storm and cold while others around them were unaffected. When they are dancing on the lake notice that Elena is perfectly happy and energetic one moment but as soon as John lets go of her she looks completely tired and exhausted great acting by Claire!. She then kind of lags behind John all the time that they are walking. They start to become separated and as a result Elena's heart gets worse. This scene if I am correct is a sort of microcosm of the movie itself. They would have been perfectly happy if they would have just stayed there dancing and experiencing love for one another but instead John decides that they need to start going somewhere. It is the embodiment of what Marciello says We should have just stayed by the lake in Poland.We are at the scene were Elena is Dying. We think that she has died but then John cries over her and finally kisses her forehead. She immediately wakes up and says What is happening John. It was heartbreaking to realize but it seemed that her surprise was from her heart getting better! She is at the brink of death and the kiss on the forehead brings her back for a moment. John however does not realize this and tries to comfort her. He props his head up and the connection between them is gone. When he resumes crying over her again she is already dead. Conclusion Once you put together all these subtle hints you have a very interesting and very tragic ending. John might have been able to save her but instead he weakened her heart by sending Michael away and continuing to travel when he should have been giving her love and affection. Even a simple kiss at the last moment might have revitalized her. Even if they were going to die no matter what they would have been much better off spending their last few hours alive with each other rather walking to nowhere. I see their trek through the winter forest as a metaphor for life. We embark upon our own journeys to find such things as fame wealth or status. We may get lost on the way or find that once we get there it is not important. We waste so much time trying to get to these places but yet the time would be so much better spent with those we love. Maybe I am right about John killing Elena maybe I am not. Watch the movie again and judge for yourself. If this movie completely confuses you remember that it is not a movie that should be taken literally. It is a dream and dreams tend to present information in a fragmented and cryptic manner. You may be confused simply because you do not have the right experiences or knowledge in life to interpret this dream. This is a brilliant movie but to recognize it as thus you need to appreciate beauty understand metaphor recognize subtlety and use whatever intelligence you have. In case you cannot do that though ill just tell you right now that it's all about love.".

John might have been able to save her but instead he weakened her heart by sending Michael away and continuing to travel when he should have been giving her love and affection. Even a simple kiss at the last moment might have revitalized her. Even if they were going to die no matter what they would have been much better off spending their last few hours alive with each other rather walking to nowhere. I see their trek through the winter forest as a metaphor for life. We embark upon our own journeys to find such things as fame wealth or status. We may get lost on the way or find that once we get there it is not important. We waste so much time trying to get to these places but yet the time would be so much better spent with those we love. Maybe I am right about John killing Elena maybe I am not. Watch the movie again and judge for yourself. If this movie completely confuses you remember that it is not a movie that should be taken literally. It is a dream and dreams tend to present information in a fragmented and cryptic manner. You may be confused simply because you do not have the right experiences or knowledge in life to interpret this dream. This is a brilliant movie but to recognize it as thus you need to appreciate beauty understand metaphor recognize subtlety and use whatever intelligence you have. In case you cannot do that though ill just tell you right now that it's all about love.";

After I saw it I could understand why the reviewers felt like this but I wholeheartedly disagree with them. This film isn't supposed to be a credible social drama with a probable storyline and believable characters. The nature of this film is light almost ethereal. From start to finish this is a fairytale an intangible voyage through events and interactions with one overshadowing theme It's all about love. I was reminded when I saw this film of the stories of Oscar Wilde they too possess an immaterial poignant view of the fleeting nature of love or happiness for that matter. The air of the film is amplified immensely by the beautiful images and the hauntingly sweet music by Zbiegniew Preisner who has composed the music for many of Kieslowskis films. Especially the huge panoramas in connections with the planes are some of the most beautiful images I have ever seen on film. The film's use of closeups takes a little getting used to but is very effective at communicating the characters' emotions. Among the actors I was especially impressed by Sean Penn who provides a sort of philosophical voiceover to the entire film. Also Joaquin Phoenix was a positive surprise he was much more toned down than I have seen him before. The cast that make up the tiny community around the main character Elena is eminently selected with a wide range of memorable characters. The actors are some of the best supporting actors around. Thomas Vinterberg has made a film that is decidedly different from Festen but in my opinion almost as good. I can't wait to see what his next project will be.".

	schema:headline " Winter in July";
	schema:reviewBody "Strange but in a positive sense was how a friend commented on It's all about Love. Indeed the plot consists of both mysteries as we're used to see from the likes of David Lynch as well as of elements typical of a modern day love story. It is probably the combination of both that makes this film unique in a sense  especially given that both elements are displayed through a say philosophical perspective. We see snow in july coming down on New York Paris Venice we hear just by the way of strange natural occurances in Uganda we see a New York City that slowly fills with corpses with noone taking care or notice and in the end we even to see people fly  they raise up in the air we're told before never to return. The film does not attempt to present a conclusion for this strangeness it rather concentrates on the love story between a surprisingly well playing Joaquin Phoenix and a wonderful Claire Danes. Some small reservations must go to some plot holes that made the storyline less convincing then it could have been. One feel that Sean Penns character is included with great necessarity. Also Preisners soundtrack is a bit too straightforward in unterlining the pictures take for instance a chorus accompanied by small orchestra constantly singing Amore while the protagonists walk through the snow very obviously not knowing where to go and why. Since half a dozen people left the audience way before the end I was able to witness a sort of empirical evidence for the unconvinience of the picture. No doubt it is in total a film as antiHollywood as rarely a love story has been that didn't come from France. And by the way has someone seen a film in recent years where the characters smoked so much than they do here? What is kept in mind most strongly are the final scenes of the film the white bride part it seems conventional at first but remains a finale that will stay with you for a while. It's all about Love has a very descriptive title and those who don't mind being confronted with an unusual and somewhat unpleasant setting for an intelligent tale get an impressive presentation of love not only being the ordinary background that makes characters behave the way they do but of love being the central aspect of physical human existence.".

	schema:headline " The artistic revolution eats its children...";
	schema:reviewBody "I have just watched It's All About Love and while I generally appreciate the recent Danish slew of art movies this was one that just didn't do it for me. I was bored throughout most of it. Parts I got other parts I was very confused by. The whole thing with the world freezing over because of lack of love is clear enough and the point is well taken although nothing much was done with this point besides simply stating it. No remedy was offered. There should have been a way out by letting John and Elena get back together again rediscovering their love but even though this happened the world was apparently still doomed.As for the Elena doppelgangers and their assassination  I just have no idea what that was about. None. Sure some bad greedy people tried to exploit her by finding and training doppelgangers they weren't actually clones were they? which contributed to the diluting of genuine human emotion and identity  but who was the assassin why did he shoot the wrong Elenas and why didn't it make any difference in the end that the real one escaped? And what about the first doppelganger who didn't seem to be the same kind as the ones that were shot? These things I don't understand. And no I didn't quite understand the thing about the flying Ugandans either although I suspect that the ability to fly symbolizes the ability to wonder and see the beauty of the world  which is the attitude that Sean Penn's character chiefly embodies. But he can't save the world either. Do the flying Ugandans represent some last sliver of hope that love can be kept alive? After all the shot of them flying only comes after the rest of the movie has ended... Well I don't know. Even if this is the case it feels hollow and inconsequential.The movie struck me as artistically ambitious but also artistically naive. It kept emphasizing obvious things while at the same time introducing confusing things that didn't make sense. I was apprehensive while watching it waiting for something interesting and fairly sensible to happen but it never did. I was never surprised because weirdness was something I was expecting. But I wanted some kind of possible explanation of the most grating weirdness and I didn't get that.I will say though that unlike some commenters I found the acting to be very good allround and I think the accents worked well. This just couldn't save the underwhelming impact of a strangely structured movie.European art movies often want to be art rather than entertainment not realizing that they could and should be both at the same time. It seems more important for the filmmakers to distance themselves from the Hollywood type of product than to create something that will feel good to the audience while also enlightening them artistically. I have to decry that attitude as stubborn immature puritanical elitist and pseudointellectual  despite the fact that I like a great deal of these movies. The only thing they lack in order to be perfect is proper entertainment value which is another area where It's All About Love falls grievous short. It's goddamn boring. The best art movies are the ones disguised as terrific romps  movies like Matrix The Fifth Element Fight Club O Brother Where Art Thou. Great movies that can be watched over and over giving their underlying messages the maximum opportunity to sink in. Also a good movie must be upbeat. It is not an absolute rule but it is a generally true one. People will eat up the message if they're enjoying watching it and feel good at the end of it. I'm not saying tragedies are bad but they are an art form that primarily belongs in the past. People need to be cheered up in this day and age. Otherwise the descent into the numbing apathy represented by the developing ice age in It's All About Love becomes the most obvious reaction. We don't want downers we want uppers! If you the artists have something important to tell us put it into an entertaining package! If you can't do that maybe you haven't got what it takes to be an artist after all because that's how the most effective art works! Y'all need to study your Shakespeare to see how it's done.My rating for It's All About Love 5 out of 10. It's on to something but ultimately it disappoints.Edit It struck me later that one way in which this movie does make sense is if the ice and cold represent love. It would jibe well with the movie's title and we do see a glass of water freeze over when the characters make love. Based on the way Vinterberg uses symbols in his subsequent movie Dear Wendy it makes sense that he would use artistic devices that reverse our usual perception. If this is the case for It's All About Love then the oncoming ice age actually represents a realm of love descending on the world. Would be nice if that were to be the case!".

	onyx:emotionText "I have just watched It's All About Love and while I generally appreciate the recent Danish slew of art movies this was one that just didn't do it for me. I was bored throughout most of it. Parts I got other parts I was very confused by. The whole thing with the world freezing over because of lack of love is clear enough and the point is well taken although nothing much was done with this point besides simply stating it. No remedy was offered. There should have been a way out by letting John and Elena get back together again rediscovering their love but even though this happened the world was apparently still doomed.As for the Elena doppelgangers and their assassination  I just have no idea what that was about. None. Sure some bad greedy people tried to exploit her by finding and training doppelgangers they weren't actually clones were they? which contributed to the diluting of genuine human emotion and identity  but who was the assassin why did he shoot the wrong Elenas and why didn't it make any difference in the end that the real one escaped? And what about the first doppelganger who didn't seem to be the same kind as the ones that were shot? These things I don't understand. And no I didn't quite understand the thing about the flying Ugandans either although I suspect that the ability to fly symbolizes the ability to wonder and see the beauty of the world  which is the attitude that Sean Penn's character chiefly embodies. But he can't save the world either. Do the flying Ugandans represent some last sliver of hope that love can be kept alive? After all the shot of them flying only comes after the rest of the movie has ended... Well I don't know. Even if this is the case it feels hollow and inconsequential.The movie struck me as artistically ambitious but also artistically naive. It kept emphasizing obvious things while at the same time introducing confusing things that didn't make sense. I was apprehensive while watching it waiting for something interesting and fairly sensible to happen but it never did. I was never surprised because weirdness was something I was expecting. But I wanted some kind of possible explanation of the most grating weirdness and I didn't get that.I will say though that unlike some commenters I found the acting to be very good allround and I think the accents worked well. This just couldn't save the underwhelming impact of a strangely structured movie.European art movies often want to be art rather than entertainment not realizing that they could and should be both at the same time. It seems more important for the filmmakers to distance themselves from the Hollywood type of product than to create something that will feel good to the audience while also enlightening them artistically. I have to decry that attitude as stubborn immature puritanical elitist and pseudointellectual  despite the fact that I like a great deal of these movies. The only thing they lack in order to be perfect is proper entertainment value which is another area where It's All About Love falls grievous short. It's goddamn boring. The best art movies are the ones disguised as terrific romps  movies like Matrix The Fifth Element Fight Club O Brother Where Art Thou. Great movies that can be watched over and over giving their underlying messages the maximum opportunity to sink in. Also a good movie must be upbeat. It is not an absolute rule but it is a generally true one. People will eat up the message if they're enjoying watching it and feel good at the end of it. I'm not saying tragedies are bad but they are an art form that primarily belongs in the past. People need to be cheered up in this day and age. Otherwise the descent into the numbing apathy represented by the developing ice age in It's All About Love becomes the most obvious reaction. We don't want downers we want uppers! If you the artists have something important to tell us put it into an entertaining package! If you can't do that maybe you haven't got what it takes to be an artist after all because that's how the most effective art works! Y'all need to study your Shakespeare to see how it's done.My rating for It's All About Love 5 out of 10. It's on to something but ultimately it disappoints.Edit It struck me later that one way in which this movie does make sense is if the ice and cold represent love. It would jibe well with the movie's title and we do see a glass of water freeze over when the characters make love. Based on the way Vinterberg uses symbols in his subsequent movie Dear Wendy it makes sense that he would use artistic devices that reverse our usual perception. If this is the case for It's All About Love then the oncoming ice age actually represents a realm of love descending on the world. Would be nice if that were to be the case!";

Mr. Morrison is our individual date with death? Why are the Ugandans all floating away? What was the brothers betrayal really about?

'Pointless' 'Weird' 'Strange' the list would continue until I run out of negative expressions.It all starts with a character called John Joaquin Phoenix who flies to New York to meet up with his wife called Elena Claire Danes . The purpose of the meeting is nothing more then to get divorce papers signed. However he is met by two of his wife's entourage and he is taken back to her hotel and is forced to endure a night at the ice skating. His wife is a world famous figure skater last time I looked this sport was as popular as synchronized swimming however for the purposes of the film it's as popular as the world cup and she as a sports personality has world wide fame and recognition that David Beckam would be envious off.Anyway long story short she is well past her sale by date in the sport and her team are replacing her with Elena Clones. Sounds stupid and is. The reason for this is because without her they are all unemployed and unemployable just as they should be as a collective group of actorsJohn is clueless to the entire situation until he meets one of the clones wielding a knife at him and it's only when Elena's Brother called Michael grows a spine and tells John of the Teams plans.As for Sean Penn who plays Johns Brother in the film well I am still trying to understand his part in the overall story in my opinion Sean Penn is one of the worst actors I have ever seen and this justified my opinion further.In conclusion Elena does not die at the hands of her management team rather she opts to die with her husband in the middle of nowhere in freezing conditions so actually opting for a much more painful prolonged death her clones were all shot her Husband John dies as well again freezing to death her brother Michael also dies in the forest but he dies alone. We can only assume and hope that Sean Penn's character dies in the plane he is a passenger off with him ending any possible chance of a sequel.For those who express such a film as ART or creative brilliance you need to lay of the alcohol.".

	schema:reviewBody "A roman negre is a French novel written by a famous author such as Octave Mirbeau who wants  perhaps because it's too personal or else because it's not selfimportant enough to satisfy the rabid litterateurs  to say something that he wouldn't say under his own name. And believe me it's more than possible that von Trier didn't want his own cognomen on a script that includes the line Here with more on the flying Ugandan phenomenon... Twice.Thomas Vinterberg from what I've seen of him is joined at the hip to Von Trier as his prettier younger apprentice. He won his spurs by trudging through a Dogme project on the ohsoserious theme of incest that critics loved only to be blown out of the water by his mentor with his own devious Dogme contribution The Idiots. And he has recently directed his third film Dear Wendy whose screenplay is actually credited to von Trier alone  can you imagine a more thankless job? But after seeing It's All About Love in the theater last year and again on Sundance Channel last night it's equally clear that influenced though he might be by his own personal Dr. Frankenstein Vinterberg's second film is ultimately the only one that is entirely HIS. No matter how much the deus ex machina  deus ex machine gun?  character of Morrison reminds you of the similar hitmanGod figure from Dogville despite the prevalence of a gnostic philosophy that von Trier only recently picked up for his American trilogy and even despite lines like I don't want to be a dog uttered ironically by people who have at that very moment thrown away their souls and become exploitative desperate vicious monsters a la the citizens of Nicole Kidman's least favorite mining community what It's All About Love proves is that there are places Vinterberg can go that von Trier can't namely into the enchanted realm of the CARAXIAN  the beautifully naive and youthfully idealistic despite the prevalent doom and despair. Like Sean Penn says at the end it really is all about love even if that love now is just a memory.People don't seem to get this movie don't seem to get much of anything anymore and every single baffled acidic review on this page makes me jealous because it proves that Vinterberg's report on the state of the world is extremely vital. This is a movie my friends that not getting means you're dead and blind so it's quite imperative that you watch again. There are many ways to prepare yourself. Perhaps the easiest would be to watch its sister films of 2004 Winterbottom's Code 46 and KarWai's 2046  the similar titles are no coincidence  as well as some more mainstream gnostic films about the costs of our profound spiritual crisis like Enduring Love Dogville The Hulk or Spielberg's twin contributions The Terminal and A.I. Or if you really want to suck all the pith out of the thing you could could immerse yourself in Monteverdi and Purcell operas plays by Shakespeare and Maeterlinck and perhaps some stories by Villiers de l'Isle Adam. Meanwhile the more lazy among you you could treat yourself to the Cliff's Notes version in this case the grotesque unreeling saga of Tom Cruise and his robot bride which this movie foreshadows in a way that is thoroughly creepy  indeed IAAL suggests that these relationships lived for the sake of the public eye with its attendant cash value will be the template for all future human interaction.  Sadly all that preparation will be futile if you don't want with all your heart for your nightmare to end. Without some curiosity about your relation to your creator some skepticism regarding technology and science and the will to overcome the fear of death that eventually drives most people into the perverse souldestroying transactions this movie illustrates with such timeless romantic flair It's All About Love will be gobbledygook to you. And so will your life by the way.".

No matter how much the deus ex machina  deus ex machine gun?  character of Morrison reminds you of the similar hitmanGod figure from Dogville despite the prevalence of a gnostic philosophy that von Trier only recently picked up for his American trilogy and even despite lines like I don't want to be a dog uttered ironically by people who have at that very moment thrown away their souls and become exploitative desperate vicious monsters a la the citizens of Nicole Kidman's least favorite mining community what It's All About Love proves is that there are places Vinterberg can go that von Trier can't namely into the enchanted realm of the CARAXIAN  the beautifully naive and youthfully idealistic despite the prevalent doom and despair. Like Sean Penn says at the end it really is all about love even if that love now is just a memory.People don't seem to get this movie don't seem to get much of anything anymore and every single baffled acidic review on this page makes me jealous because it proves that Vinterberg's report on the state of the world is extremely vital. This is a movie my friends that not getting means you're dead and blind so it's quite imperative that you watch again. There are many ways to prepare yourself. Perhaps the easiest would be to watch its sister films of 2004 Winterbottom's Code 46 and KarWai's 2046  the similar titles are no coincidence  as well as some more mainstream gnostic films about the costs of our profound spiritual crisis like Enduring Love Dogville The Hulk or Spielberg's twin contributions The Terminal and A.I. Or if you really want to suck all the pith out of the thing you could could immerse yourself in Monteverdi and Purcell operas plays by Shakespeare and Maeterlinck and perhaps some stories by Villiers de l'Isle Adam. Meanwhile the more lazy among you you could treat yourself to the Cliff's Notes version in this case the grotesque unreeling saga of Tom Cruise and his robot bride which this movie foreshadows in a way that is thoroughly creepy  indeed IAAL suggests that these relationships lived for the sake of the public eye with its attendant cash value will be the template for all future human interaction.  Sadly all that preparation will be futile if you don't want with all your heart for your nightmare to end. Without some curiosity about your relation to your creator some skepticism regarding technology and science and the will to overcome the fear of death that eventually drives most people into the perverse souldestroying transactions this movie illustrates with such timeless romantic flair It's All About Love will be gobbledygook to you. And so will your life by the way.";

	schema:reviewBody "minor spoilers to followThis is quite a difficult movie to describe.It takes place in 2021 but it's not exactly a bright future which is presented here.It's a scifi movie but apart from an aeroplane in the beginning of the movie nothing much looks difficult from what we see today.It's a thriller and it takes a long time before the audience is told what's really going on.It's a romance but it doesn't get romantic until the second half of the movie.To sum it up this movie takes a long time to get going but somehow you're captivated through the entire movie. The 100 minutes seemed to be over VERY fast even though most of the scenes seem much longer than typical scenes from your average Hollywood movie. I'm not sure this is a movie for anyone with a short attention span.I didn't understand Sean Penn's part in the movie  it seemed to be completely cut off from the rest of the movie. The idea of the people in Africa who suddenly was without gravity also seemed a little farfetched and did little more than portray an even more mysterious world.When the movie finished everybody stayed in their seats and nobody said a word for a couple of minutes. I know I was thinking about what I'd just seen and I think the rest of the audience did the same. For me it took a few hours to make most of the pieces fall into place.Right now I'd say 85 out of a possible 10 but this may change when I've had some more time to think about it.".

It is a basically a filmed dream.The director does not condescend to the audience by explaining everything or anything which is probably why it got such bad reviews.From my viewpoint the title explains what is happening in the movie. In this science fiction world love is what holds the world together. Without it the fabric of the world starts falling apart and people drop dead in the street it snows in July and people in Uganda start floating.This is definitely not a film for everybody. But if you are open minded and willing to go along for the ride it is unlike anything you have seen before.If you are looking for a coherent plot and a linear story this film is probably not for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lars von Trier who invented the minimalist film movement Dogme followed up his own Dogme film with a musical. It's a sign that the ideas of the movement sprung from a general interest in how films are made rather than a commitment to minimalism per se and the same thing can also be seen in Thomas Vinterberg's postDogme film 'It's All About Love' which does have a certain minimalist aesthetic but which is made with all of the tools available to the modern filmmaker that the Dogme movement so consciously abandoned. And in spite of it's dreadfully uninspiring title it turns out to be an interesting movie stylised beautifully constructed and engagingly mysterious. Vinterberg proves himself to be a master of mood creating scenes of a tender haunting beauty but backed by a vague sense of menace. But judged purely as a thriller the film is less good because the menace and mystery never coalesce into something more certain what we have here is images of a storyline but no real story things happen in sequence and sometimes we are allowed to understand why but it's unclear that there is a larger whole waiting to be discovered. Instead we are presented with the illusion of fragments beautifully executed and Claire Daines in particular plays her role well but without any necessary visible or invisible connectedness. The overall result could not be called great but it is ambitious distinctive and directed with no little skill.".
