	schema:reviewBody "Winnetou I.When i hear this name some of the nicest childhood memories come rushing back to me. when i first saw this movie at the age of seven or so Winnetou became my hero for years to come. Based on the novels written by Karl May german director Harald Reinl came up with one of the first wild west movies who didnt copy the american movies. The german audience rewarded that and Winnetou I  followed by II and III  became a huge success. Actually it became a huge success all around the world. Nonetheless Winnetou I wasnt Reinls first Winnetou movie. One year earlier he had released the movie Der Schatz im Silbersee which became the most successful movie of the season 6263 beating such movies as James Bond  Dr.No. The story is basically every time the same. The two friends Winnetou and Old Shatterhand try to solve the problems between the red and the white poeple and of course in the end they succeed. Winnetou I is starring Lex Barker in the role of Old Shatterhand and french actor Pierre Brice as Winnetou. They both came up with a very fine performance and especially Pierre Brice who is now 68 stayed winnetou throughout his whole life. He played Winnetou in several sequels and after the Karl May period started to fade he performed this role on several stages in germany. In my opinion the movies are most fun to watch when they remind you of your childhood. When you watch them for the first time as a grown up they may seem a bit too naive and cheesy. But even if you might dislike the movie you simply have to love the soundtrack. I am not joking here!!! German composer Martin Bttcher came up with the best soundtrack ever composed. Forget the Jurassic Park Theme or the Batman Theme. The Winnetou Theme is much better. In the year 1962 the theme stayed at top of the german charts for more than 17 weeks. It is simply breathtaking and works so well with the romantic landscape  the movie was shot in Jugoslavia . Give it a try you wont be disappointed.10 out of 10Hugh Winnetou has spoken!!!".

French actor Pierre Brice is Winnetou good Apache his Indian blood brother. Unlike the cynicism of the Spaghetti Westerns which followed shortly afterwards the German version is backward looking  nostalgic perhaps for the more simplistic and romantic version of the genre common in Hollywood before the psychological complications wrought by the 50's. Thus Shatterhand and Winnetou are more Lone Ranger and Tonto than Trinit and Bambino. The present film is fully equal of its rivals elsewhere on the continent in recreating the old west in mid europe wagon trains marauding indians and all. Winnetou 1 also has the distinction of a marvellous score by Martin Bottcher its sweeping main theme instantly memorable and looks superb in the widescreen transfer. Recent months have seen the release of three or four boxes of the films featuring Winnetou et al with another one including the 1980's TV series also worth investigating.

Now more than 30 years later and with a video copy of the film in my library to look at when in the mood I find this version of Karl May's novel rather quaint and clumsy in terms of scriptscreenplay and certainly out of step with the more popularised versions of the Wild West.However May's portrayal of late 19th century America was always a mixture of well researched facts mingled with high romantic fantasy adventure in the Knights of the Round Table or Star Wars vein. In this regard the film does capture the spirit of Karl May's novels pretty well if rather geared towards an assumed prior knowledge by the audience of the characters and of  May's novels. From today's sophisticated movie audience's perspective this film version of Winnetou I is still noteworthy for its magnificent soundtrack rivaling any John Williams score and for the noble portrayal of the hero by French actor Pierre Brice who made this role his own in numerous sequels and stage shows.".

	schema:reviewBody "To my mind Winnetou I is the second from the best movies about Winnetou after Old Shatterhand Apache's last battle. These movies are different. Winnetou I or Apache's gold is very romantic a nice fairytale about noble and human Indian and his blood brother. It's idealized story far from cruel reality. Old Shatterhand has some similar features but it is more realistic. However I can see both these movies after 40 or 35 years with pleasure despite of the naiveness of both these films as examples of excellent cinema art reminding me about ideals of childhood and youth. Director Harald Reinl is a great master of romantic cinema. This movie is very beautiful with a great deal of poetic. A beauty of nature filmed in Croatia is a background for romantic drama. Two contrasting actors  Pierre Brice Winnetou and Lex Barker Shatterhand  looks excellent together. To my mind this is the best Barker's movie he acts with true passion. Unfortunately he lost it in last Winnetou's movies.. Pierre Brice is very intelligent actor with a good taste and wit some mystery in his noble face. This mystery makes him very attractive. Marie Versini's Nschotschi is the best Indian woman I see in the European westerns. He looks excellent alongside Pierre Brice and his acting is touching. Mario Adorf is very strong as villain Santer Ralf Wolter's comical characterisation is also very good. And music Martin Boettcher is very beautiful. .".

Petersson based on Karl May's work and directed by Harald Reinl a couple years before his Oscar nomination. This film was done over 50 years ago and still you find some cast members still alive such as Mario Adorf or Marie Versini. Lead actor Pierre Brice died earlier this year. Like I already wrote in the title western films and European cinema is always a difficult combination. There are some good examples but sadly despite its popularity this is not one of them. It's been a while since I witness a title character who seemed totally forgettable like Winnetou in this one. Lex Barker does a decent job and certainly elevates the material here. Versini I found totally bland and uninteresting like Brice. Adorf id a truly charismatic actor and he makes up for the fact that his character is really stereotypical in here and wasn't written interestingly at all.As a whole this film delivers adequately for the genre in terms of visuals. Costumes makeup and cinematography are okay but all this is just another example of style over substance. The acting is mediocre overall and the story is probably the film's biggest letdown. The music is okay but sometimes sounds almost too epic for what we see. I believe Reinl is among the best AustrianGerman directors of his era so this is quite a letdown. Still German audiences loved it and really many went to see this movie which was awarded the Golden screen as well. This is certainly also the explanation why there were so many other Winnetou movies or movies based on Karl May's novels. I myself after watching this one have to admit i am not too eager to watch them. Thumbs down for Winnetou Part 1.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am an aircraft mechanic so admittedly I have trouble watching a movie which will undoubtedly abuse reality in terms of physics and aircraft design. I recall seeing previews for this and being stunned at the laughable scenario of an inverted passenger plane. That experience dropped my expectation to essentially zero.When I watched this film I was surprised in two ways. Firstly the scenario was more plausible than I had given it credit. Inverted flight is a problem for most planes because of aerodynamics. And while some aircraft are aerodynamically capable of inverted flight even some passenger planes it is additionally a problem because hydraulic and engine oil systems are often gravity fed. This means that if a plane is able to fly this way most of them won't fly for long before systems begin to fail. The film did a reasonable job of portraying this as the plane was just barely able to sustain level flight with a full pitch down elevator position and displayed low engine oil press warnings which led to engine fire. I suspect the roll maneuver would require more altitude than the film suggests...but otherwise it's not far from what could happen in reality if this was actually attempted. Most engine fire Thandles are designed to instantly shut fuel and bleed air valves for an engine...which doesn't seem to happen here but that was my biggest realism gripe.My second surprise is that this movie has very little to do with aviation. Aviation seems to be the setting for the story but the subject itself is substance abuse. The story could have just as easily been set around a bus driver or a ship captain. Given the fact that aviation was merely a setting for the story I have to give credit to the film makers for paying at least some attention to realism.I thought the story was fascinating. It's the sort of film that requires something of the viewer. You can't watch this without making moral judgements and that process requires each viewer to evaluate how they feel about certain subjects. The story creates just enough moral dilemma to get people thinking and any story that can succeed in that gets a pass from me.".

	schema:headline " Flight is an expert character study";
	schema:reviewBody "Flight takes off with a pulse pounding opening that sets the tone for the movie. However Flight is not an action movie but instead is an indepth character study of an alcoholic. While the film itself is a good story and an interesting analysis of one man's addiction to alcohol the real treasure of Flight is the superb performance from Denzel Washington.In Flight Denzel Washington plays a pilot who must crash land a commercial airliner to save the passengers on board. This may seem like a hero story since Washington was successful in saving the lives of the majority of the passengers. However the results in Washington's toxicology report showed that he had a large amount of alcohol and cocaine in his system. Suddenly this turns into a criminal investigation and Washington is faced with the difficult decision of either accepting he has a problem with drugs and alcohol or spend the rest of his life in prison.Flight is a brilliant character study because throughout the movie you aren't quite sure whether you like Washington or not. The man is a hero but he cannot stop drinking which constantly puts himself and others in danger. The director of Flight Robert Zemeckis Cast Away Forest Gump successfully makes the audience care about a man that should go to prison. Even though Washington's character is constantly letting you down you still find yourself rooting for him. A director that is able to accomplish that feeling within his audience is doing a great job at film making and character development.It is clear that Denzel Washington devoted himself to this character. Every move that Washington made was true and you believed every action his character was doing because Washington was so convincing. This film could have been very boring. After the first half an hour there isn't much action and the story drifts from a plane crash to Washington's struggles with alcohol. This could have been disappointing but instead the performance of Washington is mesmerizing to the point where you are completely drawn into the film. The film didn't need to continue having as much action as the first part of the film the plane crash because watching the development of Washington's character was so interesting.Even though Washington steals the film he is backed up with some very respectable supportive acting. Don Cheadle Hotel Rwanda Ocean's Eleven plays Washington's attorney and delivers some powerful moments in the film. Although no one would ever expect a poor performance from Cheadle. John Goodman Argo The Artist plays the comic relief in Flight. Even though Goodman is only in the film for a short amount of time he delivers some of the best scenes in the movie.Flight may not be as exciting as some of Denzel Washington's recent movies but it is definitely worth the money. The film is a very accurate portrayal of the struggles and despairs of being an alcoholic. With a fine director and an expert lead role along with many great supporting roles Flight is a film that shouldn't be missed. The only minor problem with Flight is that it's a little lengthy when it doesn't need to be. Other than that Flight is a very well made drama. A".

	schema:reviewBody "Flight is the kind of movie that studio marketing departments seem to hate. Watching the trailer it gives the feeling of a lighter film dramatic with some suspense. It does not however indicate that this is an incredibly dark film about the depths and perils of addiction. The trailer gives a completely different idea of what this movie is going to be about but with Denzel Washington's Whip Whitaker doing cocaine about thirty seconds into the runtime one can safely throw away any thoughts they may have had about it.Mr. Washington stars as Captain Whitaker piloting a flight from Florida to Georgia a relatively short flight but when something goes wrong at 30000 feet the quickthinking and talented Whip rolls the plane to pull it out of its dive and ends up crashlanding saving the lives of all but six people onboard the plane. The namesake sequence of the film is probably its best filled with amazing tension and some stellar effects.Washington absolutely shines in this role and being an actor of immeasurable talent there is no question why he is up for an Academy Award for best actor. His acting is the kind of amazing that doesn't even require words near the end of the film his performance is absolutely heartbreaking and Denzel Washington wears it in his face. Sadly the rest of the film outside of scenestealing performances from John Goodman and James Badge Dale isn't really up to par. The film follows Whip's selfdestructive alcoholism as he is caught up in an investigation into the cause of the plane crash friends try to help him and are spurned he is alienated from his family and he finds fleeting comfort in strangers such as Nicole Kelly Reilly.This is where the film runs into problems however. It wastes far too much screen time developing Nicole's character only to drop her off the face of the Earth. She enters Whip's life as a common ally someone battling her own demons and addictions but she is seeking help. She then vanishes from it just as quickly. Her character isn't all that interesting to begin with and the same can be said for most of the rest of the characters and the story in the film they only serve as a backdrop a mirror through which Whip's many many demons are reflected.Flight is unfortunately a film without much of a sense of direction. Robert Zemeckis seems to be all over the place pouring multitudes of attention into Nicole's character the plane crash and Whip battling his demons and it never seems to make up its mind as to what it's about. The film never for a moment questions whether Whip is actually at fault for the plane crash and in fact it was his actions that saved many lives. Maybe it is Washington's poise and gravitas in the scene but it never feels like Whip isn't in control. True that he is drunk and on drugs and has many serious serious problems but saving the lives of ninetysix people himself included wasn't one of them. So while the plane crash story is certainly interesting there's never any doubt about exactly how it is going to play out.Flight could have been a better film if it had capitalized on the success of the tension it so well displayed early during the plane crash. Whip's story his battles with his numerous demons and ultimately his freedom from them are moving and wonderful to watch. If Zemeckis hadn't tried to shoehorn in this ridiculous investigation plot that never really merits any attention it would have been that much better. Washington gives a fivestar performance but the rest of Flight lands at a dismal Three and a half out of Five Stars.Check out my profile for links to my other reviews!".

	schema:headline " Flight brings Denzel back to greatness!";
	schema:reviewBody "Robert Zemeckis' latest film Flight starring Academy Award Winner Denzel Washington is not only thoroughly entertaining and terrifically structured it encompasses a soul that Hollywood hasn't really delivered in quite some time. The film that closed the New York Film Festival is simply one of the best films of the year.Flight tells the story of Whip Whitaker an airline pilot that saves a plane and nearly all its passengers from a certain death. When an investigation is carried out to look into the details of the crash Whip's troubling lifestyle begins to surface. Writer John Latins creates a dynamic and an internal narrative confrontation for viewers to become immersed in a story full of mental struggle. It's a unique and very engaging story that stands as one of season's best efforts.Denzel Washington and not to be taken lightly is fully in the zone and portrays one of his finest screen moments in years. I haven't been this impressed with his abilities as an actor since The Hurricane 1999. He lands solidly in Whip giving us his natural aggression charisma and flaws. Allowing us to travel with Whip on this journey Mr. Washington proves once and for all he is one of the great treasures of American cinema. Denzel gives an access root into the character for all intended purposes a clear understanding of the inner resistance that will not only plague Whip but the movie audience as well.The story doesn't seem like an obvious choice for Robert Zemeckis who has excelled in genres that have provided masterpieces like Forrest Gump 1994 and Cast Away 2000. As the film provides a more dark and jagged approach in his directorial style Zemeckis executes with precision. It's a satisfactory effort from the director who makes his return to live action after a long string of motioncapture efforts. Assisting Washington's bravura performance is Oscarnominee Don Cheadle who teamed up with Denzel in the 90's classic film Devil in a Blue Dress 1995. As the wisecracking lawyer whose own moral values may be tested in exchange for corporate and criminal immunity Cheadle is a relieved presence. In a comedic and nearbrilliant performance John Goodman steals Flight from every actor including Washington in his short twoscene appearances. Goodman continues to show an effortless range even in poor film choices and a confidence that makes him one of the great character actors working today. It's a performance that Oscar should consider on multiple levels. In a heartbreaking turn Kelly Reilly as the drugaddicted Nicole provides an emotional epicenter and boundary that stands as one of Latins' great writing achievements. Reilly is simply marvelous.Continuing to beef up their acting resume the great Bruce Greenwood shines while Brian Geraghty continues to prove he is one of Hollywood's best kept secrets.Composer Alan Silvestri orchestrates an outstanding score that is both melodic and soothing. Cinematographer Don Burgess oncenominated for Forrest Gump gives clean fresh camera lenses look into a shockingly dirty and gritty story. Zemeckis' handle of the astounding opening scenes especially the plane crash is one of the best visual and nail biting moments of the year. Its Zemeckis at his best!Flight is not only one of the best cinematic efforts of the New York Film Festival it stands as a great surprise and entry into the 2012 Oscar season. Denzel Washington is completely Oscarbound but the buck shouldn't stop there a deserved consideration campaign should be given to John Goodman and Kelly Reilly along with screenwriter John Latins. Flight is a homerun!Read More Reviews at The Awards Circuit httpwww.awardscircuit.com".

It's a unique and very engaging story that stands as one of season's best efforts.Denzel Washington and not to be taken lightly is fully in the zone and portrays one of his finest screen moments in years. I haven't been this impressed with his abilities as an actor since The Hurricane 1999. He lands solidly in Whip giving us his natural aggression charisma and flaws. Allowing us to travel with Whip on this journey Mr. Washington proves once and for all he is one of the great treasures of American cinema. Denzel gives an access root into the character for all intended purposes a clear understanding of the inner resistance that will not only plague Whip but the movie audience as well.The story doesn't seem like an obvious choice for Robert Zemeckis who has excelled in genres that have provided masterpieces like Forrest Gump 1994 and Cast Away 2000. As the film provides a more dark and jagged approach in his directorial style Zemeckis executes with precision. It's a satisfactory effort from the director who makes his return to live action after a long string of motioncapture efforts. Assisting Washington's bravura performance is Oscarnominee Don Cheadle who teamed up with Denzel in the 90's classic film Devil in a Blue Dress 1995. As the wisecracking lawyer whose own moral values may be tested in exchange for corporate and criminal immunity Cheadle is a relieved presence. In a comedic and nearbrilliant performance John Goodman steals Flight from every actor including Washington in his short twoscene appearances. Goodman continues to show an effortless range even in poor film choices and a confidence that makes him one of the great character actors working today. It's a performance that Oscar should consider on multiple levels. In a heartbreaking turn Kelly Reilly as the drugaddicted Nicole provides an emotional epicenter and boundary that stands as one of Latins' great writing achievements. Reilly is simply marvelous.Continuing to beef up their acting resume the great Bruce Greenwood shines while Brian Geraghty continues to prove he is one of Hollywood's best kept secrets.Composer Alan Silvestri orchestrates an outstanding score that is both melodic and soothing. Cinematographer Don Burgess oncenominated for Forrest Gump gives clean fresh camera lenses look into a shockingly dirty and gritty story. Zemeckis' handle of the astounding opening scenes especially the plane crash is one of the best visual and nail biting moments of the year. Its Zemeckis at his best!Flight is not only one of the best cinematic efforts of the New York Film Festival it stands as a great surprise and entry into the 2012 Oscar season. Denzel Washington is completely Oscarbound but the buck shouldn't stop there a deserved consideration campaign should be given to John Goodman and Kelly Reilly along with screenwriter John Latins. Flight is a homerun!Read More Reviews at The Awards Circuit httpwww.awardscircuit.com";

In a day and age where almost all Hollywood movies try to thrill us with special effects and gore FLIGHT 'soars' with extraordinary acting and a story that will change lives. I went not knowing really what to expect. A drama about a crashed airplane right? Well this film is much much more. It is truth. Truth about life. Truth about addictions. Denzel Washington does an awesome believable job as an alcoholic airplane captain struggling with his addiction and accusations after the plane crash. John Goodman plays an interesting character and provides some laughs. Without giving too much away I will say that if you like drama movies or Denzel go see it.

	schema:reviewBody "Trailers might lead you to believe this is a film about flying. Or about an amazing flying feat. But it is all about the lead character Captain Whip Whitaker Denzel Washington a man who is a pilot and an alcoholic. The flying and a terrible crash provide background for the story of this man who has struggled with his illness for years.In many ways the story is not that original. We have seen numerous stories about alcoholics and heard reallife testimonies of the behaviors that accompany alcoholism and this film tracks with all of them.It is worth seeing for the brilliant portrayal of Captain Whitaker and the performances of the other actors in the film. Some parts are difficult to watch because the acting is so engaging.I also think the film raises some interesting questions that some viewers may not be willing to acknowledge. If one is an alcoholic is the entire worth of that man nothing more than what his sickness drags him down to? Are we what we do? Can we rise above our neuroses or our worst behaviors? Often we see public figures condemned in media for indiscretions or harmful acts is that then the measure of the man or woman?The film even if judged solely for its dramatic content is worth seeing.".

This script had great potential to produce an often compelling story with fine characters and direction. I'm ignoring the fact that in everyday reality a pilot like Denzel's character would be impossible since professional pilots are subjected to regular drug and alcohol tests. But alas virtually all the reviews and reviewers are blind to the film's fatal flaw.What so terribly wrong here?? In nearly all action films and psychological dramas the writers and director are offered several differentoften competingconclusions the final hook. I watched a film that deserved an 67 for its entire length until the final 15 minutes the scene where Denzel's character breaks down in a sudden fit of moral consternation in the official inquiry. At this point the film suddenly is transformed from a serious drama into a sloppy moralizing MELODRAMA. What a great loss. But Hollywood will out destroying an intrinsically dark tale by providing a redemptive happy ending that is utterly incredible. Of course 90 the audiences will love this but it doesn't change the facts.Think When Denzel's character's interrogator asks the big question in the hearing the real alcoholic he's been in every scene becomes a utterly different person. He can easily avoid blaming the innocent stewardess AND save himself with one answer I don't know. And then repeating it over and over. Exactly what a binge drinker would have doneexcept for Hollywood and HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of dollars at stake at the box office!! Concluding the film with the broken pilot preaching the gospel of AA while gratefully serving his prison term is like stepping into an entirely different fantasy one without credible linkage. Speaking as a professional writer no one who has read great novels and fiction critically can come to any other conclusion.

However even the opening scene starts to fill you in on the main characters intentions and moral standing throughout the film. If it wasn't for Denzel playing Whip his character would have gone nowhere since by all accounts he is a very unlikeable guy. Denzel does bring some warmth and a friendly face to the uncomfortable crass moments of Whip. Finding out this screenplay sat around in Hollywood for awhile until Denzel sparked interest is not really a big surprise. Other than Denzel and a few moments of Goodman's always enjoyable on screen moments this film is flat. It's about a drugalcohol addict hero who never seems to really give us what we want as an audience a moment to cheer for Whip.This film is a bythebook redemption film but done better by Johnny Depp in Blow. The cast sort of just deflates around the script and a lot of unnecessary Jesus moments which start to feel like a hidden agenda for the writers. The female lead a recovering drugporn star?lost her way is also very boring. She offers little to no real connection to the audience only aiding in predictable my life is now saved pictures on Whips jail wall at the end of the film. The film itself is watchable it's not a total failure in the technical aspect. There is a rise and fall and entertaining moments. But it is very boring this is one to watch on Netflix when there is nothing else to do. I would really like to see Denzel in a much more compelling and interesting material. The guy is incredible hence his nomination but very obviously under utilized by this material.".

Though finely acted by Denzel Washington his character has few redeeming qualities and it's flat out hard to root for him even in the clichd ending. I also have a big problem with the stereotyped copilot and his even more blatantly stereotyped wife. The copilot a devout Christian becomes worthless during the crash sequence relying on prayer and basically panicking... meanwhile totally wasted and fried Denzel Washington drunk and high on coke saves the day. Then later in a hospital scene the copilot's Stepfordwifeesque spouse stand by his side never blinks and her only dialog consists of her saying Praise Jesus in a loud monotone every time her husband says something. If minority or gay characters were portrayed as such blatant stereotypes the critics and mainstream media would be up in arms. Other than that Flight is a pretty good movie  well acted and directed and hauntingly realistic. The entire crash sequence is extremely realistic enough so that I guarantee you'll be thinking about it the next time you hit severe turbulence on a trip somewhere. Butbefore seeing it you need to be aware that Flight is not the movie the commercials make you think it is so go in with your eyes open. Oh and another note don't take your kids to see this movie unless exposing them to raunchy language particularly one scene where a drunk and belligerent Washington tells off a recovering addictand full frontal female nudity is OK with you.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film seems to be in as much denial as a raging alcoholic and its clearly trying to preach that drinking is bad. Yet the opening scene we have the Denzel Washington performing a flight maneuver the red baron would be proud of. The praise for his piloting skills comes up in the film as regular as an internet popup. Just so we never forget how good a pilot he is even if drunk!But now here's the money shot he's a junkie and an alcoholic and he was higher than Ozzy Osbourne when saving the plane from crashing to the ground. But the message of the film is drinking is bad oh yes drugs are worse because if you taking them while in control of a vehicle you might exhibited piloting skills Luke and Anakin Skywalker would be proud of. This is kind of strange message because I thought the reason drinking and taking drugs was made illegal while flying and driving is that it impairs your judgment and you are more likely to cause a crash. But in this film universe seems to be the other way round.Anyhow Denzel's character is bad for doing this and the guilt for saving all those lives while higher than a space cadet is too much and he confesses. He then goes to jail but it's a Hollywood Jail where in fact he is happy now since he confessed. What should have happen in the film is that his drinking and drugs caused the crashed and killed passengers. This is real life and the brutal reality of people in responsibility of vehicles or planes while intoxicated. But I guess this is not Hollywood enough.Did nobody in the film think it was weird logic? There's a terrible plane crash people die while a pilot is high on vodka and cocaine yet the cause of the crash is 100 mechanical failure and it's the great piloting skill that prevents further death? This film sends a dangerous message because it sends the message the only think Denzel's character did wrong was get caught. That his piloting skills were in no way impacted during the crash this is a very bad message to send to young people. A very bad film.".

To put it bluntly the main disaster here was the director pulling punches playing it safe. Remarkably the supposed center piece of the movie the crash was actually completely irrelevant to the plot. Think about the setup the pilot was not responsible for the crash and he saved the plane for the most part with very few deaths. The movie took great pains to make it clear how extraordinary this was everyone crashed the plane in simulations etc. Well did the pilot's alcoholism help this or hurt this performance? Simple question but this apparently had nothing to do with the moral point of the movie so somehow his miracle flying and his alcoholism were never considered as related. There could have been many different solutions. E.G. perhaps the pilot missed something obvious in his walk around so he both caused the crash and saved the plane would have preserved the main arc of the story kept the crash at the center of the movie but legitimately brought in the alcoholism. And the ending simply sucked in prison now wiser and honest........sigh boring as was the reconciliation with his son feel good American tripe ending double sigh.".

OK I thought good cast Denzel usually doesn't let me down and waited for more than 100 mins to see if something would actually happen. But nothing... It turns out that the whole theme of the movie was just alcohol abuse. As a south European I always have a hard time understanding whats the problem with alcohol abuse in the US why people cant just enjoy a drink from time to time. On top of that there are some hints of other drugs abuse but it seems that for some reason the producers think that smoking isn't that bad after all I'm a smoker so I can relate to that... LOL.That said the movie is very well made nice photography nice scenes good acting. But 130 something minutes to get to the conclusion that alcohol is bad... well I wouldn't have watched it if only I knew. Pity for the misleading description of the movie.As for the rest some characters don't seem to really have a real impact on the story or the main character. They are just there probably to give a little flavour to an otherwise pointless movie.So I give it a 4 as it doesn't deserve less in my opinion the packaging is very well made. But I really do not see the point of crafting such a huge context just to express this kind of message. The guy could have been a taxi driver. For the sake of clarity in my scale 4 is crap with some merits but not to be suggested to anyone.".

	schema:headline " Washington Carries this Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Imagine reallife hero pilot Sulley Sullenberger with a severe drug  and alcohol problem and doing a few lines prior to taking controls in  the cockpit yet still managing to land his packed airplane with  absolute precision on the Hudson River. Would he still be a hero?  That's the dilemma of the new film Flight which just hit theaters  this week.  This is a difficult movie to sit through. Yet it's tough to decide  which is more gutwrenching  watching a doomed airliner packed full  of passengers buckled down in a nosedive headed for nearcertain death  or the central character played by Denzel Washington whose personal  life is just as out of control.  While Washington's character nicknamed Whip manages to miraculously  maneuver the aircraft towards a crash landing that undoubtedly saves  lives the captain comes under increasing scrutiny once the postcrash  investigation begins. Conducted by the National Transportation Safety  Board NTSB the investigation begins to reveal some troubling  revelations about Whip and his conduct. Every second of the pilot and  crew's lives are scrutinized which uncovers some ugly secrets about  how Whip spends most of his free time. Most of the time his best  friends are named Jim Beam and Jack Daniels with a few lines of  cocaine to add a little spice.  The heroaddict dichotomy is a marvelous dramatic device which helps to  sustain a longerthanaverage 2.5 hour movie. The audience faces a real  conflict here. We don't know whether to cheer for Whip to beat the rap  and move on with his life after all he heroically saved lives or be  exposed as the fraud he is so the healing and recovery process can  begin.  Indeed this film is not so much about the plane crash and aftermath as  it is about addiction and realizing that one has a serious problem.  While the crash scene is one of the most intense such moments ever  recreated on film the film's highest moments of drama actually occurs  in hotel rooms and in front of refrigerators when Whip faces his  toughest choice  whether to drink or not. Most of the time the  bottle wins the war of the inner spirit just as it tragically so often  does with real life alcoholics.  If there's any doubt about Denzel Washington being one of the finest  actors of our generation this should finally settle the issue. His is  a resume filled with high moments  his Academy Award winning  overthetop portrayal of a corrupt cop in Training Day perhaps being  his best work. But this performance is every bit as strong for entirely  different reasons. Washington shows great range in this film  flipflopping between the boozing jetsetting playboy played to  perfection and the sad and lonely loser that deep inside he know he  has become.  It's Washington when he's most vulnerable that carries this film. Just  the right expression at the right time a teardrop in a rare moment  when he lets his guard down or displaying a phony facade of going  through the motions while being stoned and high on the inside  these  are the virtues that only a few actors working today could so  successfully give to an audience. No doubt Washington's role here will  be remembered when Best Actor nominations come out for this year's  Oscars.  Robert Zemickis' direction is also nearperfect. This is often a dark  and depressing movie a sort of Leaving Las Vegas with an airline  pilot in the central sympathetic role. Yet we never get too low even  watching a man hellbent on selfdestruction. Zemickis perhaps best  known for his direction of Forrest Gump handles the material with  great care managing an excellent supporting cast  led by two superb  roles by Bruce Greenwood and Don Cheadle  who serve to change the  mood just when the film seems to become too dark.  There are some scenes and story lines that I found unnecessary. Whip  finds a romantic interest along the way a fellow addict. I had a hard  time buying the notion that a 20year career airline pilot would find  much in common with a very plainlooking heroin addict one step up from  doing back alley tricks as someone to find comfort with . The girl  simply lacks any appeal. To her credit at least she's headed in the  right direction in her recovery while Whip guzzles one beer after  another. But I found her not only to be implausible partner but totally  unnecessary to the story  adding at least 30 minutes to a film that  probably should have capped out at two hours.  The film builds to a fulfilling climax that won't be revealed here.  Some ends are tied up nicely while others remain frayed. Which is all  fine  that's how real life works.  In short this is good film made much better by the wide range of  talent displayed by one of Hollywood's finest actors. Denzel  Washington's performance alone is reason enough to see the film.".

Washington shows great range in this film  flipflopping between the boozing jetsetting playboy played to  perfection and the sad and lonely loser that deep inside he know he  has become.  It's Washington when he's most vulnerable that carries this film. Just  the right expression at the right time a teardrop in a rare moment  when he lets his guard down or displaying a phony facade of going  through the motions while being stoned and high on the inside  these  are the virtues that only a few actors working today could so  successfully give to an audience. No doubt Washington's role here will  be remembered when Best Actor nominations come out for this year's  Oscars.  Robert Zemickis' direction is also nearperfect. This is often a dark  and depressing movie a sort of Leaving Las Vegas with an airline  pilot in the central sympathetic role. Yet we never get too low even  watching a man hellbent on selfdestruction. Zemickis perhaps best  known for his direction of Forrest Gump handles the material with  great care managing an excellent supporting cast  led by two superb  roles by Bruce Greenwood and Don Cheadle  who serve to change the  mood just when the film seems to become too dark.  There are some scenes and story lines that I found unnecessary. Whip  finds a romantic interest along the way a fellow addict. I had a hard  time buying the notion that a 20year career airline pilot would find  much in common with a very plainlooking heroin addict one step up from  doing back alley tricks as someone to find comfort with . The girl  simply lacks any appeal. To her credit at least she's headed in the  right direction in her recovery while Whip guzzles one beer after  another. But I found her not only to be implausible partner but totally  unnecessary to the story  adding at least 30 minutes to a film that  probably should have capped out at two hours.  The film builds to a fulfilling climax that won't be revealed here.  Some ends are tied up nicely while others remain frayed. Which is all  fine  that's how real life works.  In short this is good film made much better by the wide range of  talent displayed by one of Hollywood's finest actors. Denzel  Washington's performance alone is reason enough to see the film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Flight is the story of a commercial pilot Whip Whitaker Denzel Washington who is able to land a defective plane with extraordinary skill maneuvering it into an inverted position in order to slow the decent. We see this inverted flight captured in the trailer but believe it or not this is not the most provocative element of this film. The story is so thought provoking that it will have you walking out of the theater questioning whether or not you could or would choose nobility over selfpreservation. Most of what takes place behind the scenes looming like a predator waiting to strike is the blame game with Whip continuously asserting that no one could have landed that plane except him. That point is supported but it's the collateral damage of his arrogance that is at the forefront of determining liability. The trailer also lets the audience in on the fact that Whip is found to have alcohol in his system as is discussed with Hugh Lang Don Cheadle who is the attorney brought in to defend Whip on behalf of the Pilot's association. Hugh was very straight and very narrow which was the case with most of the characters aside from Whip. It was the dichotomy of Whip's persona so brilliantly conveyed in his mannerisms responses and facial expressions that makes the performance Oscar Golden Globe BET Trumpet Image MTV and any other awards worthy. If Mr. Washington had uttered eight bars I would say he deserves a Hip Hop award or a Grammy he was that convincing. I recognized this person that Mr. Washington portrayed so true to life which is not just a testament to good writing but mostly to the phenomenal acting talent that is Denzel. All the characteristics that made this individual a hero were the same characteristics that could potentially make him infamous. I will say that I as well as many fans am always open to greater insight into who Denzel is however the rear view was totally unnecessary. The film does a great job of telling a story about the human condition nobody is one dimensional and sometimes extreme circumstances make you write yourself a reality check. The question is when you cash that check will you be happy with the results. If you have any fear of flying this is not the movie for you. It will reinforce that fear and possibly cause you to swear off flying altogether. I give this film a green light.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very serious movie. It deals with an issue that is probably more common than any of us who ever fly would probably care to think about  the possibility of alcoholic pilots flying under the influence. There's some potential for this to become a pretty good character study of Whip Whitaker Denzel Washington  the alcoholic pilot. But it really doesn't manage to do that. There's not much in this character to actually study to be honest. Whip is an alcoholic pilot who won't admit that he has a drinking problem and is basically a jerk toward anyone who tries to convince him otherwise. He's not a likable character he's not a character you really spend very much time rooting for. You're happy at the end of the movie when he finally makes his confession to the NTSB hearing and I personally appreciated that at the very end he seemed repentant and cleaned up and was looking for neither sympathy nor excuses even as he sat in prison. But there was a lot between the beginning and the end that really didn't work all that well.I didn't really care for the character of Nicole Kelly Reilly. Actually to be fair it's wasn't that I didn't care for Nicole. My problem was that I didn't see the need for Nicole. Nicole was an alcoholic and drug addict on the road to recovery who hooked up with and started a relationship with Whip. But to what end? Reilly was fine as Nicole but what did the character really add to the movie? I just didn't see it. I didn't much care for the union rep Bruce Greenwood or the union's lawyer Don Cheadle. All they basically managed to do was reinforce stereotypes about both unions and lawyers as they fight to get Whip off the hook even though they know beyond a shadow of a doubt that he had been drinking and that he was a drunk. That's what I want out of a pilot's union and its lawyer  getting the drunk pilot back at the controls of a plane! John Goodman added some basically comic relief to the movie as Harling a cartoonish drugdealer friend of Whip's. I didn't care for the copilot Ken Evans and his obnoxious but surprising unemotional wife Bethany Anne Lind  thank you Jesus repeatedly in monotonous tones who are angry with Whip for the crash which has left the copilot crippled for life but manage to get him into a prayer session. With perhaps the exception of Nicole who was likable but who was extraneous to the story none of them were characters I cared about. And even Whip I didn't care that much about.I was really put off by what will surely become one of the classic ridiculous plot devices in Hollywood history when the night before the NTSB hearing the union gets Whip put up in a hotel with all the alcohol taken out of the fridge and a guard at the door to make sure he doesn't go out for a drink. Unfortunately the door to the adjoining room which was also unfortunately unoccupied was unlocked so Whip could help himself to that fridge with no one knowing and go on a binge. Please. Don't insult my intelligence by stretching things too far. That was dumb.The best part of the movie was the portrayal of the airline crash at the beginning as Whip becomes a hero at first for managing to crashland the plane with only six people being killed. That was very well done very tense and seemed realistic enough to me. After that to be honest this kind of fell apart. 510".

All it was in the movie was the crash and him doing cocaine and drinking. Yawn. I don't get why the copilot's wife in the movie was an annoying religious woman who's only line was praise Jesus!

	schema:reviewBody "I graduated from the Naval Academy in Annapolis MD in 1988. I went to see the movie with my wife an ex Navy Nurse last weekend. We were eager to see the familiar grounds of the Academy and see an accurate depiction of the real Midshipman experience. We're still waiting.Okay by now you've read plenty of comments regarding the plot predictable the acting cardboard etc. As a remake of the whole Officer and a Gentleman theme it's not too bad. The whole poor boy with an attitude bucking the system thing has been done.If you are planning to see the movie hoping it's a realistic depiction of life at the Naval Academy or in the military in generaldon't bother. They actually got a few things surprisingly right and many more things wrong. Therefore I thought I'd give a little insider's look at the nitpicky details.What they got right The uniforms by and large. It's not likely that every single Mid would have scored Expert on their rifle and pistol qualifications but they all seem to have earned those ribbons. BTW Jordanna Brewster's character was a Second Class Midshipman a Junior. Tyrese was as he said a Senior.The rooms pretty close. Actually the showers are in the rooms.The bedspreads Strange but true. Little details like the Plebe sleeping on top of his covers so he won't have to remake the rack.The Plebe Indoctrination The apparently silly memorized responses to questions like How's the Cow? She walks she talks she's full of chalk. The lacteal fluid extracted from the female of the bovine species is prolific to the Nth degree. It's designed to train you to be able to rapidly and accurately memorize complex information strings. Obviously it still works I learned it 22 years ago and still know it verbatim. Marching off demerits yep done it. The chowcalls yelling the menu in the passageway. Cannonballs with Hard Sauce! Yum! Expulsion for an Honor Offense Apparently someone caught lying today would be put on Honor Probation. Twenty years ago anyone violating the Honor Code not concept was separated. Boxing All MALE midshipmen were required to take two semesters of boxing your Plebe and Youngster sophomore years. The boxing coach was excellent. He fit the part very well. There was an open tournament each year but it's held in a big field house not a dark and dusty courtroom set. It's really not that big a deal to most mids.Jumpers People have committed suicide by jumping from windows in Bancroft Hall the residence hall.What They Got Wrong The Academy They found some period buildings in Philly with lots of columns etc. The locations in no way captured the feel of the Academy or the city. Annapolis is a beautiful tourist city and the state capital on the Chesapeake Bay. The nearest shipyard would be in Baltimore and they don't build warships there.The Military Discipline Plebes don't saunter down the Pway hall they march or run. Nobody goes outside in uniform without a cover hat. Most of Huard's responses to his superiors would have gotten him fried. Conversations are not casual and they're usually one way.Hazing Buckets of water at extend arms? Maybe We used rifles. Racist or sexist remarks wouldn't be tolerated. Cole's little sycophantic buddy was an insult to real Midshipmen.The boxing again not that important. Females don't box. Or didn't 20 years ago. Nobody boxes without protective headgearNCAA rules only pro's can be that stupid.Twins one of the best acting jobs and totally unrealistic. There are no fat plebes. You have to be in top shape just to get in there are physicals and athletic evaluations. You eat 4000 to 5000 calories a day during Plebe summer and still lose weight. I lost 10 pounds. Anyone overweight is put on a restricted diet.Midshipman Authority A Firstie regardless of his stripes is not going to be timing the obstacle course and then making separation decisions. A midshipman's training costs hundreds of thousands of dollars only qualified officials will separate someone and only after every attempt at remediation has failed. Bottom line nobody with that low a degree of selfdiscipline will survive to commissioning. You have to want to be there yourself not for someone else.Free Time There isn't any Plebe year. Huard certainly wouldn't have been in the boxing gym after dark alone. or with an upperclass female.Fraternization Jordanna's character as the senior member would know better than to fraternize with kiss a subordinate. He was strictly offlimits until the end of his Plebe Year. It happens but wouldn't be obvious jogging together?Plebes No More WTF was that? Only graduates throw their covers in the air.By the way Wahlburg sp? was a Lieutenant Commander they kept calling him Lieutenant. The list goes on but this is just a small sampling of the accurate and inaccurate points of this forgettable movie. They could have fixed the script gotten competent advisors and made a much better movie without any additional budget. It costs the same to film them doing something right rather than wrong. I can see why the Academy Administration distanced themselves from this project.".

The whole poor boy with an attitude bucking the system thing has been done.If you are planning to see the movie hoping it's a realistic depiction of life at the Naval Academy or in the military in generaldon't bother. They actually got a few things surprisingly right and many more things wrong. Therefore I thought I'd give a little insider's look at the nitpicky details.What they got right The uniforms by and large. It's not likely that every single Mid would have scored Expert on their rifle and pistol qualifications but they all seem to have earned those ribbons. BTW Jordanna Brewster's character was a Second Class Midshipman a Junior. Tyrese was as he said a Senior.The rooms pretty close. Actually the showers are in the rooms.The bedspreads Strange but true. Little details like the Plebe sleeping on top of his covers so he won't have to remake the rack.The Plebe Indoctrination The apparently silly memorized responses to questions like How's the Cow? She walks she talks she's full of chalk. The lacteal fluid extracted from the female of the bovine species is prolific to the Nth degree. It's designed to train you to be able to rapidly and accurately memorize complex information strings. Obviously it still works I learned it 22 years ago and still know it verbatim. Marching off demerits yep done it. The chowcalls yelling the menu in the passageway. Cannonballs with Hard Sauce! Yum! Expulsion for an Honor Offense Apparently someone caught lying today would be put on Honor Probation. Twenty years ago anyone violating the Honor Code not concept was separated. Boxing All MALE midshipmen were required to take two semesters of boxing your Plebe and Youngster sophomore years. The boxing coach was excellent. He fit the part very well. There was an open tournament each year but it's held in a big field house not a dark and dusty courtroom set. It's really not that big a deal to most mids.Jumpers People have committed suicide by jumping from windows in Bancroft Hall the residence hall.What They Got Wrong The Academy They found some period buildings in Philly with lots of columns etc. The locations in no way captured the feel of the Academy or the city. Annapolis is a beautiful tourist city and the state capital on the Chesapeake Bay. The nearest shipyard would be in Baltimore and they don't build warships there.The Military Discipline Plebes don't saunter down the Pway hall they march or run. Nobody goes outside in uniform without a cover hat. Most of Huard's responses to his superiors would have gotten him fried. Conversations are not casual and they're usually one way.Hazing Buckets of water at extend arms? Maybe We used rifles. Racist or sexist remarks wouldn't be tolerated. Cole's little sycophantic buddy was an insult to real Midshipmen.The boxing again not that important. Females don't box. Or didn't 20 years ago. Nobody boxes without protective headgearNCAA rules only pro's can be that stupid.Twins one of the best acting jobs and totally unrealistic. There are no fat plebes. You have to be in top shape just to get in there are physicals and athletic evaluations. You eat 4000 to 5000 calories a day during Plebe summer and still lose weight. I lost 10 pounds. Anyone overweight is put on a restricted diet.Midshipman Authority A Firstie regardless of his stripes is not going to be timing the obstacle course and then making separation decisions. A midshipman's training costs hundreds of thousands of dollars only qualified officials will separate someone and only after every attempt at remediation has failed. Bottom line nobody with that low a degree of selfdiscipline will survive to commissioning. You have to want to be there yourself not for someone else.Free Time There isn't any Plebe year. Huard certainly wouldn't have been in the boxing gym after dark alone. or with an upperclass female.Fraternization Jordanna's character as the senior member would know better than to fraternize with kiss a subordinate. He was strictly offlimits until the end of his Plebe Year. It happens but wouldn't be obvious jogging together?Plebes No More WTF was that? Only graduates throw their covers in the air.By the way Wahlburg sp? was a Lieutenant Commander they kept calling him Lieutenant. The list goes on but this is just a small sampling of the accurate and inaccurate points of this forgettable movie. They could have fixed the script gotten competent advisors and made a much better movie without any additional budget. It costs the same to film them doing something right rather than wrong. I can see why the Academy Administration distanced themselves from this project.";

The film doesn't resemble the trailer enough and I feel that the trailer was deliberately designed to be misleading. There is so much difference I feel defrauded.

None of those things are in the film at all.The entire film centers around a rather lame and phony looking 3 round amateur boxing match at the Academy. That kind of thing should have had it's proper perspective in the career of a Midshipman at Annapolis a very brief and minor one done for diversion from arduous studies. Beyond that this seems to be a collection of gee let's find some pretty looking people and put them in tight uniforms.At least the actors themselves seemed to try and give the audience their money's worth. I think the best performance was by Vicellous Reon Shannon who played a much picked on overweight student. Next was Jordana Brewster who still looked and acted more girlie than your average competent Midshipman. James Franco looked buff in the manner of young Hollywood and did OK with the material he was given but it lacked enough story substance to feel real.In the final analysis serious drawbacks in the film included completely inappropriate depictions of overt and blatant sexism racial discrimination and hazing none of which would be tolerated at all in the modern academy. Including those things constitutes a serious insult to the integrity and honor of men and women in uniform at a time when they are fighting and dying for the cause of freedom around the world.".

I got that but 'Annapolis' is better than my expectations suggested. That's not to say its a good movie it's just not terrible.The reason it is not terrible is a portion of the cast. James Franco manages to overcome his poorly written formulaic lead with his hardedged brand of acting. Vicellous Shannon has an effective supporting role as Twins an overweight black man from Arkansas. His hometown he explains is counting on him to survive and pass the year. This is an unexpectedly touching subplot and I was surprised it worked. Donnie Wahlberg and Chi McBride have good supporting roles and many of the anonymous students are portrayed convincingly.Unfortunately the production is let down by three factors The script Tyrese Gibson and Jordana Brewster. The script is well horrific. While its nice to see military students cuss some of the racist and sexist remarks are extremely out of place. The script is a tireless formula that simply will not go away and I don't think I need to name said formula. Next offender Tyrese Gibson. Tyrese is not a bad actor but the aforementioned terrible script seems to have made him think he needed to imitate R. Lee Ermey. He does this with the subtlety of a jackhammer. Last but not least Jordana Brewster. I simply do not believe for one second she is a Navy Midshipman. The romance between her and Franco is laughinducing and completely unrealistic how many times have I heard military students aren't allowed to fraternize?.While it's not the disaster I expected 'Annapolis' still earns my dislike. There's good stuff but not enough.".

Still Annapolis could have been an entertaining popcorn flick. Unfortunately its dull and very generic. Almost every scene plays like a scene from a better movie. There is no creativity to be found here at all. It's an empty movie and it has very little to offer. The premise may have seemed like a good idea on paper but it sure didn't turn out that way. It's no surprise that it was released in January.The acting is not very good and it brings the film down quite a bit. James Franco is an okay actor but I don't think he's good enough to be a leading man. He just doesn't have what it takes and this film proves it. Jordana Brewster gives an awful performance as Ali. She's very pretty but she can't act at all. Tyrese Gibson can be a good actor when he wants to be like in Four Brothers. Here he gives a bland unconvincing performance and he seemed to be reading from the cue cards the entire time. The rest of the cast isn't very good but it's these three that should have carried the film.There are some good things to be found in Annapolis though. The boxing scenes are actually pretty good. Of course they occur at the end so sitting through the first 80 minutes or so is probably not worth it. There are also a few supporting characters that are interesting like Twins. That's really all the good I can get from this film. The chemistry between Jordana and James just wasn't there. The story wasn't bad just nothing really new. It's a film that's kind of just there. Its not really worth watching but if its on T.V and there's nothing else on then it may not hurt as much as spending 9 in the theater. In the end Annapolis is a bland forgettable film that will be just fine on DVD. Rating 510".

I'm talking about the ships submarines jets helicopters being out to see the ship explosion and such. The only ship you see is the one that is being built and it never even leaves the harbor. I left feeling like they didn't have the budget to finish the movie so they just cut it short. There are no scenes where they are outside the grounds of Annapolis unless you count the bar across the bay. It was a good movie as long as you know what you are expecting. Expect to see boxing scenes as that is the new focus of the movie after they had to cut out all the stuff after they ran out of money. Oh and also the line in the trailer Why are you so hard on him etc. yep CUT!".

I just got out of the theater a half hour ago and I left disappointed because I was expecting to see what was promised in the trailer. I'm talking about the ships submarines jets helicopters being out to see the ship explosion and such. The only ship you see is the one that is being built and it never even leaves the harbor. I left feeling like they didn't have the budget to finish the movie so they just cut it short. There are no scenes where they are outside the grounds of Annapolis unless you count the bar across the bay. It was a good movie as long as you know what you are expecting. Expect to see boxing scenes as that is the new focus of the movie after they had to cut out all the stuff after they ran out of money. Oh and also the line in the trailer Why are you so hard on him etc. yep CUT!";

	schema:reviewBody "Frankly I'm appalled that so many people on here have given this movie such a poor rating. This movie is excellent! It is NOT a documentary therefore it IS fiction. Many of these negative reviews are written by people who are affiliated with the armed forces and are criticizing this movie because of its lack of a factual depiction of life at training facilities. Uhm....hello it's a MOVIE! This is not meant to act as a recruiting film. People who are considering going into the armed forces don't sit there and say to themselves.......Hmmm I really don't know if I'm cut out for this maybe I should rent Annapolis and see what it's 'really' like. Geesh people! It's a fictional film meant to entertain and it definitely delivers. Movies are meant to be a form of escapism. Great movies fully engage you in their world and keep your attention so that you get emotionally involved in the plot and feel as though you are getting to know the characters. This movie does exactly that. A great movie forces you to forget about your own world for approximately 2 hours. During the time I was watching this film I was so fully engrossed in it that not a single thought unrelated to the movie entered my mind. Now that's what I would deem a great movie! Others are most certainly entitled to their own opinion but I would hate for this movie not to receive its due acclaim because others are hung up on the fact that it is not a documentary film depicting what life is like training to become an officer in the armed forces. I am not claiming to know anything about that world but I think in this particular case it helps me to better appreciate this movie for what it is at face value  a fictional film meant to entertain. I was definitely entertained and taken to another world whilst watching this movie. I highly recommend this film!".

James Franco will certainly make a legion of new fans with his heartwarming portrayal of Jake Huard. You can not help but root for him and want him to succeed. Jake is an everyday guy but with movie star looks who desperately wants the acceptance of his father beautifully played by Brian Goodman. Its a back story also shared by another yet totally different character in the film. Tyrese Gibson gives another fine performance. The talented Donnie Wahlberg excels in a relatively small role. What mars the film is a forced love interest with Jordana Brewster who is totally miscast. ANNAPOLIS is a thoroughly enjoyable movie going experience and at under two hours it doesn't overstay its welcome. If you weren't a James Franco fan entering the theater you will be when you leave. You won't be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Annapolis reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.comrating 1.0 out of 4In creating an inspirational film there must be inspiration behind the pen of the writer and also behind the lens of the camera. Annapolis is the laziest of feelgood cinema with each element of its narrative loosely tacked upon the celluloid every line of dialogue following a woefully welltrodden trail of story arcs. The film fails to even decide in its direction stumbling about its indecision on what to pull into focus the Naval Academy or the hypedup boxing tournament. Both stories are tired one from its hammering in the news and the other from its walk around the block in last year's multiplexes. Interest in a patriotic military is low with over 60 of audiences disapproving of the current political spread and as the much talkedabout box office failure of Cinderella Man has indicated audiences are now left cold by boxing films.Maybe Annapolis' release is somehow timely a cinematic opportunity to boost morale among citizens about the situation in Iraq. But the film seems to warily circle the Naval Academy making an effort to avoid blatant stabs at patriotism and not make much rahrah sentiment with its story. And if this all sounds contradictory it's frankly no fault of mine but the fault of the film's. Director Justin Lin Better Luck Tomorrow seems inclined to cover everything up and not allow us to witness its atrocity. Each of the film's ideas is smothered just when they seem poised to bloom but maybe this is because each of Annapolis' ideas has potential for controversy. If Lin were to focus on the students' work at the Academy critics would bemoan the film as gratingly patriotic but if he were to downplay every aspect of the military other critics would call him unAmerican. Instead Lin timidly finds a blurry middleground that satisfies absolutely nothing and results in films that's tired and plain. Annapolis opens promisingly enough in a smoky boxing ring surrounded by metal folding chairs and weary old men. In the ring is Jake Huard James Franco rising from an extreme closeup of his eyes and to his feet from a near knockout. One man slaps the palm of his neighbor deciding now that Jake hasn't a chance. But Jake pulls through and rallies against his opponent resulting in the paid man returning his money to his now smug neighbor. Donnie Wahlberg sits calmly in the audience posture straight as a board's as any respectable Lieutenant Commander's would be. But Jake isn't a boxer instead working as a welder with his father burning away at the Navy's newest cruiser.The day after the fight Wahlberg's Lt. Cmdr. Burton offers him the last remaining spot at the Naval Academy. Jake had applied but been waitlisted and resigned to working with his father. But now at the Academy Jake must succeed to prove to his blankfaced dad that he's worth some pride. The antagonist is his direct superior Cole played by another Blist actor Tyrese Gibson. Cole doesn't speak much but has knack for sneering and flexing his muscles in the ring. Another of his superiors is Ali the plucker of Jake's heartstrings played by Jordana Brewster in an unlikely but smoothly convincing performance. Jake isn't the most subservient of students and lacks in naval trivia and calculus proficiency often resulting in punishment for his entire team. Jake doesn't react well to these reprimands and takes them personally questioning whether or not he ever deserved acceptance to the school at all. This boils down to Jake counting down the days until he can pop Cole in the kisser at the endofyear boxing tournament. In films about teenagers and young adults I often find myself wishing the director had had the nerve to cast actual teenagers in the roles of teenaged characters. But due to financial obligations roles will be forever filled with twentysomething actors playing down to eighteen or fifteen. And with Annapolis despite the story's impotence and story faults numbering more than my fingers can count it would excessively benefit from a cast of upandcoming teenagers. Jake and Ali's relationship would heighten into something risky and vibrantly sexual an eighteen year old fraternizing with his direct superior. And Jake's rivalry with Cole would develop more aggressively adding muscle and feeling to scenes where an eighteen yearold would take the ring with a beefy twentysomething. Even the backandforth shooting of dialogue between Jake and his roommates would take on a new air of reality becoming less of a scripted linereading and more like a few guys sittin' around cracking bad jokes. The rawness of this youth could have even brought Lin's film into satisfying territory where his tepid middleground storytelling might have been eclipsed by some honest character arcs. Instead Annapolis is the uninspired inspirational film a timorous bore of average proportions. It's pointless and full of indecision. Its boxing scenes are apathetic to creativity its romance buoyed by safety restraints and its fatherson sentiment unearned. Sometimes Annapolis reminded me of a Marines TV spot when Lin attempts to hone in on life at the Academy. The scenes are hardrocking montages that work less like plot developing sequences and more like government funded commercials. I kept expecting Jake to stand straight put his hand to his head in salute and for the throaty voice to come over in narration The Few The Proud The Marines. But it never does and when the credits roll we're reminded that this is no innocent plug for the military but one of the most haplessly incapable films we'll see in 2006. www.samseescinema.com".

	schema:reviewBody "When a film is entitled ANNAPOLIS one expects to see something that resembles or in some part reflects the title. Unfortunately this is based on a small twicetold story rendered in what appears to be a Frankenscript made up from parts of other scripts from feature films superior to it. It's a superficial story at that. It's also obvious that the neither writer nor director served in either the US Navy or the USN Marines Division nor apparently bothered to hire a knowledgeable consultant for it lacks authenticity and is marred by technical errors. For example there's a line where Midshipman Cole well played by the striking Tyrese Gibson a former Marine that we later learn will return to the Marines after graduating Annapolis refers to himself as a soldier. This is a rather grinding mistake because no Sailor or Marine ever refers to himself as a soldier even while intoxicated and spouting philosophic euphemisms. It just never happens.Perhaps the most glaring error is the entire writing of the Twins character once again very well played by Vicellous Reon Shannon who is an overweight physically unqualified plebe. In truth the entry examination for Annapolis is done in two parts and one part covers an entire day on physical qualifications that all candidates must pass. Physically unqualified students are never found at the Naval Academy. The part should simply have never been written as it is. The idea itself obviously comes from any number of old boot camp films where it not only happens but where this characterization has long ago become trite.At this writing I do not know why the picture was not made at Annapolis itself but this fact encompasses an entire basket of missed opportunities. If one were to entitle a film ANNAPOLIS the story might have been told similarly to John Ford's THE LONG GRAY LINE 1955 where through the experience of one man we get the emotional impact and historicity of West Point. USNA Annapolis is one of the greatest institutions of the United States having been officially created in 1850. Its grounds and buildings are stunning when one sees the parades of midshipmen pass in review. There is nothing in this film that comes close to illustrating or in any way demonstrating the glory of the Academy. Boxing which is the highlight of this unfortunate film is but a small aspect of life there. Yet the activity eats up the entire conclusion of this film. Better to have named it Rocky's Younger Midshipman Brother.There is one small plus side however the cast is always engaging and talented so what little is there is salvaged by their performances. For those of us who were disappointed by this amateurish nonvisionary production we hope that the film will play well with the younger schoolage audiences. It's not a total loss.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well I guess I'm in a boat going up river once again. I figured Annapolis would not garner top ratings but I fully expected it to at least be better than average and imagine my shock when that wasn't the case!! The film is being absolutely panned and although I managed to find one or two lone reviewers who agreed with me...the majority HATED IT!! What a shame!! I was absolutely riveted and captivated by this powerful film. It wasn't necessarily the performances which could be described as a tiny bit stiff but the mix of Military film inspirational story and boxing film that just kept me absolutely drawn into the story. The romance aspect of it was forced and unnecessary I will agree with many people on that but it didn't take away from the fact that it was a fast paced well made intriguing story about a young man's desire to defeat many odds and become what he always knew he could be.James Franco plays Jake Huard. Huard is a complex character. He's a defeatist to himself quiet a bit of a loner who is estranged from his father whom he works for and lives with but doesn't connect to at all. He feels like nobody supports him or wants him to succeed and yet he feels the draw to be better than what he is. Franco is a great actor. He does a terrific job in the SpiderMan series and was fantastic as James Dean he has a leading man quality in a quiet sort of brooding fashion. His portrayal of Huard is well rounded he's honest and works hard and trust worthy and he looks good. He doesn't quite show the emotion involved in the role to it's extent but he does pretty decently. Jordana Brewster plays his love interest and one of the superior officers Ali. Now her role is mostly pointless and the romance between them is completely unnecessary to the story but it's there and it doesn't particularly get in the way it's just not valid. They have good chemistry together if the story called for it. She's not believable as superior officer and she shows little strength...but she is beautiful...stunning in fact and she's the eye candy for the film in a uniform wearing kind of way. Somehow she becomes his trainer for boxing having never explained why she is such an expert...her character is just kind of there. I don't blame her acting I blame the script for her character. Vicellous Reon Shannon plays Twins roommate to Franco's Huard. He is another of the stories within the story of Annapolis. His character was hailed as hero by his small hometown before he had even decided whether or not he wanted to go. So his inspiration for success is an entire city. Shannon is an intense actor in this film and his character is amazing. He is one of the strongest performances in the film right up to his tragic conclusion to his story. Already a veteran TV actor for many many years if this film had done better it could have seriously put a spotlight on his talent. Tyrese Gibson plays Huard's intense and rather cruel superior officer who he constantly finds himself up against. Gibson seems larger than life on screen and always seem a giant against Franco but they make good enemies and Gibson makes a good bad guy of sorts although he isn't truly a bad guy simply protecting what he loves the marines. Donnie Wahlberg makes a small but important enough performance as the man who recruits Huard to Annapolis Lt. Commander Burton. Wahlberg is an extremely underrated actor who needs a great breakthrough role and I'm always pleased to see him in something I enjoy. The supporting cast is also quite good from beginning to end including performances by Roger Fan who does a great job as the annoying by the book good guy Loo Brian Goodman as Jake's father in an unfortunately small role but extremely similar to his role in Fast and The Furious Tokyo Drift by the same director and Katie Hein as one of the only focused on women in the story. There are certainly some problems with the film I won't deny that. Yes perhaps some of it is rehashed and misrepresented but it's the boxing that makes the film exciting and is also a representation of the battles they face without actually putting them in war time situation. There is a lot of boxing and it's brilliantly choreographed and perfectly executed despite the so called boxing experts on here who say it's not life like. I won't try to explain myself as to why I loved this film...it just had heart it was easy to watch and it uplifted me brought tears to my eyes and I would watch it again and again which is why I slap a perfect score on it. The romance didn't work for me some of the performances were a little dry but for a low budget film costing just over 7 million it had big budget quality and an inspiring story. One of the first lines when Franco arrives at Annapolis is that you don't learn from success you learn from failure and that truth holds throughout the entire film. I encourage anyone out there who wants to see this film not for it's artistic or entertainment merit although I was completely entertained but rather an uplifting good time and a great story then check this one out. Director Justin Lin has now impressed me completely with this outstanding film and The Fast and The Furious Tokyo Drift where he delivered an outstanding story as well. Check this one out...I can't recommend it enough against all others on here!! 1010".

	onyx:emotionText "Well I guess I'm in a boat going up river once again. I figured Annapolis would not garner top ratings but I fully expected it to at least be better than average and imagine my shock when that wasn't the case!! The film is being absolutely panned and although I managed to find one or two lone reviewers who agreed with me...the majority HATED IT!! What a shame!! I was absolutely riveted and captivated by this powerful film. It wasn't necessarily the performances which could be described as a tiny bit stiff but the mix of Military film inspirational story and boxing film that just kept me absolutely drawn into the story. The romance aspect of it was forced and unnecessary I will agree with many people on that but it didn't take away from the fact that it was a fast paced well made intriguing story about a young man's desire to defeat many odds and become what he always knew he could be.James Franco plays Jake Huard. Huard is a complex character. He's a defeatist to himself quiet a bit of a loner who is estranged from his father whom he works for and lives with but doesn't connect to at all. He feels like nobody supports him or wants him to succeed and yet he feels the draw to be better than what he is. Franco is a great actor. He does a terrific job in the SpiderMan series and was fantastic as James Dean he has a leading man quality in a quiet sort of brooding fashion. His portrayal of Huard is well rounded he's honest and works hard and trust worthy and he looks good. He doesn't quite show the emotion involved in the role to it's extent but he does pretty decently. Jordana Brewster plays his love interest and one of the superior officers Ali. Now her role is mostly pointless and the romance between them is completely unnecessary to the story but it's there and it doesn't particularly get in the way it's just not valid. They have good chemistry together if the story called for it. She's not believable as superior officer and she shows little strength...but she is beautiful...stunning in fact and she's the eye candy for the film in a uniform wearing kind of way.

Anna an enormously talented middleaged woman is overlooked while exceptional opportunities come along for a pretty young girl with little to offer but looks and a perky personality who just happens to use Anna to get to the top.The story is supposed to be based on a real person and her experience trying to find work in New York after having been a star in Europe. Kirkland brings this character to life with amazing depth and courage. Although she lost the Oscar that year to the well  deserving Cher for Moonstruck I think if more people had seen this film Kirkland would have walked away with the little gold man that night. I am still inspired by what the film has to say about women in this business who lose opportunities because of ageism. What is it with American producers? I love Judi Dench and Vanessa Redgrave but if they were American women they would never find work! The Hollywood film industry should take a lesson from their European counterparts and use the talented older ladies we have right here!!!

	schema:reviewBody "Unable to sleep late at night I got one of my brother's old VHS tapes and played something called Anna. This 20year old movie made by European artists in America for the independent film company Vestron Pictures starred Sally Kirkland in the Oscarnominated title role as a former Czech movie actress who's now struggling offBroadway as an understudy for seven roles in an arthouse play. Robert Fields plays her writer boyfriend Daniel Steven Gilbornwho I remember as Kevin Arnold's math teacher in The Wonder Yearsher exhusband Tonda and supermodel Paulina Porizkova is KrystynaAnna's protg. When I read the end credits at the last name on the cast list was Francis' daughter Sofia Coppola as Noodle though I don't remember her or the character. Anyway this movie began amusingly enough with Anna suffering an audition reciting a nursery rhyme while standing on one leg and shouting but as the film went on we feel for her as she suffers a breakdown after Krystyna steals Anna's life story for her own as shewith Anna's helprises in stardom. Kirkland deserved her only Academy Award nomination that I felt was even better than the one who actually won in the Best Actress category that year Cher in Moonstruck. Porizkova was also pretty good for her ingnue role as we see her and Kirkland initially bond. Since Vestron no longer exists this movie may be difficult to find now but Anna is definitely worth a look.".

	schema:headline " Anna the actress who would demand a bigger trailer...";
	schema:reviewBody "A drama at its very core Anna displays that genuine truth that all actors age and sometimes fade away. Anna is a character that believes America is her safety net her home and it can do her no wrong  but she refuses to belittle herself to do work she doesn't believe in. She is hardnosed optimistic stubborn and arrogant when it comes to her life yet not afraid to let others in yet drop them at a moments notice. Anna flipflops between personalities which makes this film ideal of an aging star but not idea of the viewing audience. Anna has been praised for its star Sally Kirkland and her ability to get grungy for the role but a month into 2008 Anna does not remain a staple of film culture. It is dated dull and formulaically chaotic.Director Yurek Bogayevicz has a message hidden within Anna about the falsehoods of Czechoslovakia both politically and socially but Kirkland refuses to let them upstage her. Bogayevicz is not afraid to play with the camera to use wooden frames to allow Kirkland to stand out and he is not afraid to lessen the surrounding characters so that when you walk away from the film it is Kirkland you remember. If it isn't obvious this film didn't sit well with me. From the opening of the first act and deep within the second Anna felt like a high school theater production. The characters were nonexistent there was no enlightening prestory and there was no definition of time or place. There was Sally Kirkland stubbornly saying that she is better than the other actresses vying for the same lifestyle that she wants. Randomly she encounters a friend a young girl that has also traveled a long distance to get to America for the glitz and glamour and two of them within the span of 20 minutes build a friendship that could break all walls. It is emotionally boring and unbelievable. Again randomly we meet Anna's boyfriend Daniel played by the weak Robert Fields who brings nothing to the table in terms of definition or character  only to boost the attention onto Kirkland's Anna. Through the course of nearly two hours we watch as more random acts coupled with unnamed characters intertwine together to feebly create a story that is held together by loose threads  and SALLY KIRKLAND. Arg it pains me to continue to say this but Anna could have been a fantastic film had Bogayevicz presented equal time between Anna Daniel and Krystina but instead we are forced into a onesided game where emotional scenes speak louder than plot.Is this where Charlize Theron found inspiration for her beautyless role in Monster or Halle Berry in Monster's Ball? Was Sally Kirkland one of the early actresses discover that by letting themselves go for a character Oscar will shine in their direction? Throughout this film I was disgusted by Kirkland's portrayal of Anna and Bogayevicz's lack of excitement for anything else fluent. Bogayevicz gives us an Anna that doesn't work hard for her parts doesn't care for others and is generally mean spirited  yet we are to feel sympathy for her? Near the beginning of the film she forces what she wants to do onto others and gets upset when she doesn't get her way. Sure aging actresses my have that appeal to them but Kirkland creates a more childish character instead of a mature one. That is where Anna could have improved. If this was a mature Kirkland I would have gobbled it up but this stammering childish Anna was impossible to believe. While my favorite scene was near the end where Anna goes to watch one of her older films playing included is absurd makeout characters and the film burns this scene is also one of my least favorite. Anna has made a phenomenal life for herself creating films and building the dream yet when anyone else wants to enter that spotlight she gets jealous and outraged. This didn't make for a character I wanted to stand behind nor win Oscars. Coupled with the classic 80s background synthesizer the outrageous overthe top wardrobe and the displaced ending where did that come from and what happened??  Anna slipped far in the scope of amazing cinema. It was a showpiece an opportunity for an aging star to yell at the world one more time. In this one it worked but I don't think I will be fooled again.Overall I cannot say that I was impressed with this film. Anna is not a film about an aging film star it is about Sally Kirkland and ONLY Sally Kirkland. Bogayevicz tries to do more with the story but fails either because Kirkland will not allow him or he just realizes that there isn't enough to support a full story. There are one or two decent scenes in this film but nothing that promotes this film as innovative or influential. Bogayevicz did not create a character that audiences would believe tear up for or dedicate a Sunday afternoon with  he created an annoyance. Kirkland wasn't Anna she was an actress playing her a bit overdone and crusty on the sides. Perhaps I missed the scope of this film but what makes films like this work is the cooperation of everyone involved. That wasn't the case here. In Anna Kirkland orders Daniel to act like a dog apparently as a symbolic act and yet during the entire emotional scene I couldn't help but think that was what Kirkland was like to those on the set. She didn't make this into a film she transformed it into her own production and because of it Anna failed. I cannot suggest this to anyone  from one Czech to another  skip it! Grade   out of  for that pesky theater scene that creeped me out".

It didn't win anything though and seems to have been forgotten over the years. Perhaps this is because the public has since found other Swedish films to be more noteworthy in particular the works of Bille August and the later works of Ingmar Bergman.Sad to say because The Emigrants is a film that closely examines two very different cultures in an effective and insightful way. A diverse group of Swedish peasants among them a married couple a priest a prostitute and a young upstart endure backbreaking labor in their homeland to little profit. They decide to move to the states after being influenced by the exaggerated stories spread abroad everyone has more than enough food everyone is filthy rich etc.. The audience sympathizes with them not just because they endure so much in Sweden but also because they believe the stories they hear about frontier life in America. Yes they will obviously have to strive and struggle to survive in their new home but they are all the more admirable because of their adherence to the American dream.The Emigrants is harsh and often unrelenting in the straightforward way it depicts the realities encountered by the Swedish settlers. The scenes where they travel across the ocean in a small cramped and diseased ship are appropriately claustrophobic and terrifying. Later the family at the center of the story threatens to break up when Liv Ullmann's character a fragile young mother loses track of her daughter while hurrying to board a steamboat.Although most of the characters were better developed in the sequel to this film The New Land Troell's story is very moving in its sincere depiction of how outsiders came to this country to pursue their hopes and dreams.".

The scenes where they travel across the ocean in a small cramped and diseased ship are appropriately claustrophobic and terrifying. Later the family at the center of the story threatens to break up when Liv Ullmann's character a fragile young mother loses track of her daughter while hurrying to board a steamboat.Although most of the characters were better developed in the sequel to this film The New Land Troell's story is very moving in its sincere depiction of how outsiders came to this country to pursue their hopes and dreams.";

Even though I haven't read all way through them since 2000 I still appreciate having them in my collection and Grandma even saved me some bucks by letting me inherit her copies. I might also add that these books were among the few ones that her husband my grandfather and my mother's father ever even looked into according to Mum. Vilhelm Moberg sure is one of our greatest writers over here in Sweden of all time. If we move over to the movie it's really good at following the books. I hate it when filmmakers do unnecessary changes in the story when they turn novels into movies. But fortunately Troell actually followed the books really well. And I really understand that Vilhelm Moberg wanted him and no one else to make these novels into movies.The first movie Utvandrarna The emigrants is thus a really great movie adaption of the two novels Utvandrarna The emigrants and Invandrarna The immigrants. It's about how some people from Smland in Sweden decide to emigrate to America in the year 1850. We have Karl Oskar Nilsson who decides to move to America with his wife Kristina and their children and his younger brother Robert. Even though Kristina was reluctant to leave Sweden Karl Oskar convinces her to emigrate after their oldest daughter dies so that the rest of the children can have better lives. Robert is forever marked by how he was treated by his master when he was a farmhand and wants to leave for the free country in the west where servants can't be treated badly. Robert's friend Arvid is accused of having sex with a cow and wants to get away from that nasty rumor and follow Robert to the golden land in the west. Kristina's uncle Danjel and his wife IngaLena has to flee Sweden because of religious reasons. The former prostitute Ulrika and her illegitimate daughter Elin don't have anything to lose either. Jonas Petter a neighbor of Karl Oskar and Kristina just wants to get away from his unhappy marriage. After a hard journey over the Atlantic these people come to Minnesota where there already are a lot of Swedish people.The story is continued in the movie Nybyggarna The new land.".

But using a realistic and not melodramatic approach the film lets us know what the family is struggling with and allows us to understand them.The characters played by Ingmar Bergman regulars Max von Sydow Liv Ullmann and Allan Edwall face poor harvests starvation poverty religious persecution and even false rumours of bestiality. They look to the US as a place where a farmer can become rich with even American slavery looking better than their previous situation. Getting to North America however will take a rough voyage in which our heroes will face disease lice and death and come into psychological conflict with each other. This makes for a strong drama.Surely one of the best foreign films of the 1970s and a great addition to the strong cinematic year 1971 The Emigrants is an understated but still compelling film and I look forward to The Criterion Collection's restoration.".

It premiered in Sweden was shot on locations in Denmark Sweden and USA is the first part of a twopart film which was succeeded by The New Land 1972 and produced by Bengt Forslund. It tells the story about KarlOskar Nilsson who lives on a farm in Ljuders socken Smland Sweden with his father his mother and his brother Robert. When KarlOskar meets seventeenyearold Kristina Johansdotter he falls in love with her and later he marries her. Kristina gives birth to several children and they become a happy family but as time goes by it gets harder and more challenging to run the farm much due to the harvest. After reading an ad in a newspaper about free land in NorthAmerica KarlOskar begins to consider emigrating from Sweden with his family. Acutely and engagingly directed by Jan Troell this period drama set against the backdrop of Sweden during the 1840s and 1850s draws an extensive and gripping portrayal of a group of farmers and Christians who emigrate from their homeland a humane portrayal of a close friendship between two young farmhands and a compassionate portrayal of an evolving relationship between a farmer and is housewife. While notable for its poignant art direction by Swedish production designer P.A. Lundgren 19112002 the distinct cinematography by Jan Troell and the fine costume design by Swedish costume designer UllaBritt Sderlund 19431985 this characterdriven and dialogdriven historic epic where the natural surroundings plays an important and symbolic part examines themes like family relations interpersonal relations friendship poverty courage and dignity.This Swedish production which was a big investment in Swedish cinema at the time depicts several studies of character has a significant atmosphere which is emphasized by the naturalistic milieu depictions and the subtle score by Swedish composer Erik Nordgren 19131992 and is impelled and reinforced by the empathic and involving acting performances by Swedish actors Max von Sydow Allan Edwall 1924 1997 Eddie Axberg and Pierre Lindstedt Swedish actress and singer Monica Zetterlund 19372005 and Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a leading role at the 45th Academy Awards in 1973 marking her as the first Norwegian actress ever to gain an Academy Award nomination.

There is no music at the film's beginning and darn little music throughout. I think that and the pacing were done deliberately in order to emphasize the starkness and blandness of life in rural Sweden in 1844. You see that the folks are simple and their lives hellishly awful...and you see a lot of this awfulness and understand for many at that time period that WAS life. This makes for a wonderful historical and educational film...though NOT a cinematic or especially enjoyable one.

	schema:reviewBody "Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann play a husband and wife who decide to emigrate to America with their family and fellow villagers in the mid19th century. The first part of the film details the challenges these people face that make them want to emigrate in the first place. An oppressive village hierarchy in which all laws and rules of accepted behavior are arbitrated by a selfappointed few as well as conditions that make farming a constant struggle leave them craving the freedoms and fertility of the mythic U.S. The second part of the film is a meticulous recreation of what the actual journey was like including a long segment about the miseries of crossing the Atlantic Ocean including sea sickness and lice and the interminable trek up the Mississippi River to Minnesota once they landed. It's almost impossible to wrap your head around how frightening this entire experience would have been for them. These people knew almost nothing about the world outside of their small Swedish village one young man doesn't even know how the ocean works and thinks they're all going to drown if the water rises and trust themselves to strangers who don't speak their language or really have any reason to look out for their interests. It's a fascinating film and feels more like a documentary than a fictional narrative.Unfortunately the only version I was able to see was the dubbed one shown by TCM. I would have much preferred to see it subtitled so that I could experience von Sydow's and Ullmann's performances as they were meant to be experienced.The Emigrants was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 1971 Academy Awards and then because of Oscar's weird eligibility rules popped up again a year later with four nominations for Best Picture Best Director Jan Troell Best Actress Ullmann and Best Adapted Screenplay. At the time it was only the third foreign language film after Grand Illusion and Z to receive a Best Picture nomination. And the film's sequel The New Land was up for Best Foreign Language Film the same year that The Emigrants was in the Best Picture race. Good couple of years for director Jan Troell.Grade A".

	onyx:emotionText "Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann play a husband and wife who decide to emigrate to America with their family and fellow villagers in the mid19th century. The first part of the film details the challenges these people face that make them want to emigrate in the first place. An oppressive village hierarchy in which all laws and rules of accepted behavior are arbitrated by a selfappointed few as well as conditions that make farming a constant struggle leave them craving the freedoms and fertility of the mythic U.S. The second part of the film is a meticulous recreation of what the actual journey was like including a long segment about the miseries of crossing the Atlantic Ocean including sea sickness and lice and the interminable trek up the Mississippi River to Minnesota once they landed.

The second film follows the family from Sweden to the United States.   The situation for them in the U.S. isn't that much better when they arrive but they have reasonable hope that they will succeed.  Max von Sydow plays the husband Karl Oskar and Liv Ullmann plays his wife Kristina. Both are extraordinarily talented. In addition Von Sydow is handsome and Ullmann is impossibly beautiful.  The remainder of the cast is strong and the acting by the children is wonderful.  These movies will work better on the large screen but we had to settle for the small screen. Both films carry very high IMDb rating of 8.0. I gave each a 10.".

Ms. Headly is not the greatest actress in the world and beside Dreyfuss she's downright embarrassing.  William Macy's character is so cliched that it warrants no further discussion.  The whole subplot with Rowena and her romantic interest in Mr. Holland ran about ten minutes too long.  And the ending bit where the arts funding gets cut seemed a little too political.But overall a great film surely one of Dreyfuss' best and one of my favorite films.I'm a musician.  And I liked it.

	schema:reviewBody "I remember seeing Mr. Holland's Opus for the first time in high school. I liked it then and still do. Films about teaching often involve tough kids and less than ideal teachers among other things.  I have to say this film is an exception. Mr. Holland is an inspiration in so many ways that he does not realize or even want to acknowledge. It is also a story that could have taken place and that some people can relate to.  This is why I enjoyed it so much.Mr. Holland has a dream of composing a very memorable and moving symphony and to ultimately be rich and famous. But working odd jobs in pursuit of his dream doesn't appeal to him. Reluctantly he takes a day job as a high school music teacher to support the family and at first hates it. His students are not motivated to learn through readings and tests and do not respond well to the music of Bach. When he finds they love rock and roll he integrates this into the curriculum much of the disapproval of the administration who believe rock and roll by its very nature leads to a breakdown in discipline. He teaches and mentors many students over the years from a clarinet student who doubts her talent and feels inferior to her musically talented family to a wrestler who becomes a drummer and a talented singer with her eye on him who wants to go to Broadway despite any barriers. Whether or not he knows it Mr. Holland inspires them to do something worthwhile.Despite his love and talent for teaching Mr. Holland cannot develop this same level of rapport and love with his wife Iris and son Cole who is deaf. His desire for Cole to appreciate music is outweighed by Cole's inability to hear and his father's reluctance to help him. Cole learns sign language from his teachers and mother predominantly. Mr. Holland appears to be the kind of person who detests imperfection of any kind and this strains his familial relationships. Gradually though he learns to accept and deal with these challenges and becomes more loving and appreciative. I recommend Mr. Holland's Opus for musicians singers music teachers and really everyone. Enjoy the show!".

The sensitivity and perception of the Director Stephen Herek 101 Dalmatians adds a special touch to the story.Richard Dreyfuss The Goodbye Girl The Competition The American President was  nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe for this role which is my view one of his best performances. He is good in all stages of the different seasons of the life of Mr. Holland.  I seldom cry while watching a movie  but when Mr. Holland enters the school auditorium with grey hair and the entire school is applauding when he retires it makes me cry. I cry every time I watch it  and I can also cry every time I bring it to mind. If I ever get a part where I have to cry all I have to do is to bring back that memory back!  That moment is a combination of my mother a music teacher and my dad aging. There is no greater love than to lay your life for another... When I graduated from college I wrote a letter thanking my parents for the rainy days they had to go to work  and for all the sacrifices they made for me and left it on top of the dining room table so they could find when I was not around.  Needless to say that the entire family cried. That is what that scene means to me. I do not see Mr. Holland as a frustrated composer he was just frustrated because he had other commitments that did not give him the time to compose. Glenne Headly did a great job playing Iris Holland. She has appeared in ER recently. Olympia Dukakis Steel Magnolias plays  Principal Jacobs. It is beautiful when close to her retirement she gives Mr. Holland a gift.  Jean Louisa Kell The Day Lincoln Was Shot is Rowena Morgan who steals the show because she sings beautifully. William H. Macy Fargo plays Vice Principal Wolters who goes insane when he listens popular music coming from Mr. Holland's classroom. Poor Gertrude Lang  Alicia Witt Cybill is trying so hard to get the technique that she forgets about her feelings. I love when she finally gets to feel the piece and lets herself go.Then when she comes back as grown up is very touching. A music teacher having a deaf child is ironic. Mr. Holland  teaching the kids about Beethoven is marvelous!  I love when Cole Anthony Natale II comes back as an adult and participates in the celebration of his dad's retirement and also because he himself is going to teach at the school for the deaf in Washington DC. This movie struck a cord with me because of the music and because of all the elements that were brought into movie and story. I would give it a10  if I could. It is one of my favorite dramas! I am not much of a drama person I prefer comedy but this is a very special drama.".

Despite initially hating his job Holland soon learns to enjoy it and how best to communicate the love of music to his pupils.  We trace his life over 3040years as he has a son with his wife and goes through great emotional times while putting his personal dreams to one side.Although this had sentimental life lesson film' written all over it I still wanted to give it a go and strangely still enjoyed it.  The film is very much a bit of praise for all those who are unsung heroes in there lives and it had the potential to be really sickly sentimental.  Happily a good script manages to avoid this for the majority of the time.The weakness of the film is the fact it that it does try to cover a lifetime and occasionally there isn't enough plot to do that well.  I know it would have been difficult but I do feel that the film could have been either a little tighter or filled to overflowing with plot to make it feel shorter. As it is it is still enjoyable but it does feel a little wandering at times  but I guess that's like life in a way.  When the climax comes though it is hard not to be a little moved by the lesson that the film is teaching us.However the reason for the success of the film is also the reason for it's Oscar nomination  Richard Dreyfuss on good form.  He kept me watching even when the material was stretched.  He is totally believable in the role  for a microcosm of his performance watch his face when the announcement is made about the surprise they have prepared for him  his emotion got me right away!  He deserved his nomination for this as he is captivating over the whole film.  He even ages very convincingly and make up should be congratulated.  However while makeup were concentrating on Dreyfuss they totally forgot about Headly who doesn't age a bit until the final time period apart from looking a bit tired.  She is badly miscast and she doesn't fit the role at all.  Thomas Macy Dukakis and Anderson as the teenage Cole all do well in support  but this is Dreyfuss' movie.Overall I enjoyed this.  I usually struggle with things like this because they pile the sentiment on thick like a daytime TVM.  Happily this script avoids that are the majority of the flaws are compensated for by a strong performance from Dreyfuss.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mr. Holland's Opus is the story of a musician whose passion in life is to compose great music. But in order to provide for his wife and son Glenn Holland must take a post as a high school music teacher which is seemingly the last thing he ever wanted to do. In the thirtyyear period of which this story takes place mid1960s to mid1990s Mr. Holland discovers through his struggles little by little student by student that he indeed has what it takes to become a great teacher and mentor. He applies the entire history of music from Beethoven to Billie Holiday to rockandroll as he expresses it in order to help his students learn to appreciate what music is and what it has to offer to the world. Of course Mr. Holland faces some hard challenges along the way namely the fact that his numerous teaching responsibilities take him away from giving his son who has a ninetypercent hearing loss the attention he desires. In the end when all of the arts programs get dropped from the school curricula Mr. Holland believes that all of his teaching efforts have been for nothing. It is then and only then that he realizes how much of an impact he has actually made on the entire community.The casting of Mr. Holland's Opus is terrific. Richard Dreyfuss was THE actor for the leading role of struggling music teacher Glenn Holland who experiences life with all of its joys and sorrows through music. Glenne Headly is wonderful as Mr. Holland's loving reasoning understanding wife Iris. I highly admire Jay Thomas as phys ed teacher Bill Meister who strikes up a lifetime friendship with Glenn right at the start of Glenn's teaching career. Not to mention Olympia Dukakis in her topnotch portrayal of principal Helen Jacobs William H. Macy as vice principal Gene Wolters Alicia Witt as struggling clarinet student Gertrude Lang Jean Louisa Kelly as the lovely soprano Rowena Morgan and Terrence Howard as athletic stardrumming novice Louis Russ.Here are my personal favorite scenes from this heartwarming film. Mr. Holland shows his first signs of success when he convinces the selfconscious Gertrude Lang that playing music is meant to be enjoyable and is not about notes on a page with this in mind Gertrude shuns her music stand closes her eyes and plays the sunset on her clarinet. Until Rowena Morgan makes her first appearance the various singers who audition for the upcoming Gershwin revue prove themselves amusing in their interpretations of I Got Rhythm. A tense moment in the Hollands' household occurs when their little boy Cole deaf and with virtually no communication skills has difficulty showing his mother what he wants from the cupboard. Rowena sings a beautiful version of Someone to Watch over Me with the orchestra conducted by Mr. Holland on the last night of the Gershwin revue. Shortly after learning that his son is deaf Mr. Holland is almost in tears as he describes to his music appreciation class the agony of Beethoven's deafness. Following the assassination of musician John Lennon Mr. Holland sings a nicely orchestrated version of Lennon's Beautiful Boy and dedicates it to his own son Cole now a teenager Joseph Anderson from then on Glenn shares a much greater rapport with the forgiving Cole. And finally Mr. Holland cannot fight back the tears at his high school's surprise celebration of his thirty years as the music teacher his former student Gertrude Lang now a governor Joanna Gleason makes him aware of all the lives he has touched We are your symphony Mr. Holland. We are the melodies and the notes of your opus and we are the music of your life. Mr. Holland's Opus is a film that I believe offers hope to the many people in this world who are forced to take day jobs for which they have no high regard. As this movie progresses we come to understand how fortunate Glenn Holland's students are to have him for their music teacher.".

	onyx:emotionText "Mr. Holland's Opus is the story of a musician whose passion in life is to compose great music. But in order to provide for his wife and son Glenn Holland must take a post as a high school music teacher which is seemingly the last thing he ever wanted to do. In the thirtyyear period of which this story takes place mid1960s to mid1990s Mr. Holland discovers through his struggles little by little student by student that he indeed has what it takes to become a great teacher and mentor. He applies the entire history of music from Beethoven to Billie Holiday to rockandroll as he expresses it in order to help his students learn to appreciate what music is and what it has to offer to the world. Of course Mr. Holland faces some hard challenges along the way namely the fact that his numerous teaching responsibilities take him away from giving his son who has a ninetypercent hearing loss the attention he desires. In the end when all of the arts programs get dropped from the school curricula Mr. Holland believes that all of his teaching efforts have been for nothing. It is then and only then that he realizes how much of an impact he has actually made on the entire community.The casting of Mr. Holland's Opus is terrific.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a line of the Beatles' song that Mr. Holland sings to his son Cole at a concert. I've seen this movie plenty of times but for the first time I noticed just how well this line resonates in this movie. In fact this line is the basis for the movie and could stand in for the whole movie in a pinch except that we would be missing out on one of the most moving and inspirational films to come out of Hollywood in the past few years.Mr. Holland's Opus is the story of a man who loves music who practically lives and breathes music. We see at the beginning of the film and throughout the rest of it a man who is most passionate when he is within music. When his wife informs him that she is pregnant he likens the feeling to falling in love with John Coltrane's music. When a student complains to him that he knows everything there is to know about music Mr. Holland responds by reminding him that the name of his class is Music Appreciation and explaining forcefully that it doesn't matter how much you know about music if you don't appreciate it.The movie takes Mr. Holland through three decades from the '60s to the mid'90s. In the spirit of nostalgia films like Forrest Gump we are guided through the decades by vignettes of archive footage depicting scenes such as Nixon announcing his resignation Gerald Ford tripping down the stairs and even good old Frankenfurter representing the sexual revolution. As a piece of nostalgia for those times and the days of high school Mr. Holland's Opus works great. As a chronicle of a man's life and the impact he has on others it works even better.This film could have turned into cheap schmaltz but through its cast and a story that reaches wonderful poignancy and honesty at times it manages to represent something so much more than that. Richard Dreyfuss always a natural actor is perfectly real and moving as Glenn Holland. I can't describe his performance in words simply because it deserves to be seen more than just written about. And even though this is basically Dreyfuss's movie the supporting cast makes an impression as well. Glenne Headly as Mr. Holland's wife shows tremendous resilience and emotion as the mother of a disabled child. When she explodes at her husband because of his lack of understanding you explode with her because we believe every word she is saying.I don't know if movies can change lives. I think some have the potential to. I know there are movies that can inspire their audiences to be better people It's a Wonderful Life is one Casablanca is another. While Mr. Holland's Opus does not reach the quality that those two do and who can blame it? it has a similar and near equal impact and that is definitely a compliment. And how perfect a movie about a man who changes lives that can also change lives.".

Holland is an intensely flawed character from the getgo and the reason we cry at the end of this movie isn't because his American Symphony is moving indeed it's nothing more than treacly and clichd but because he has in two decades or so sincerely figured out what's important. He certainly has his moments of sleaziness and selfish behavior but without them the movie wouldn't have a purpose or any real story.This film is about a man's journey late in life which is a journey most of us don't want or need. It is a slow and honorable journey in which he learns a lot about himself and the audience learns to appreciate music and his students' unending charm and talent.Overall an unbelievably wellputtogether film about life and its many unbelievable yet realistic paths.

The film highlights the erosion of creativity within schools the power of art the way these institutions degrade the mind how school syllabuses are subject to budget cuts and outside job demands but mostly it says that no life spent in a worthy pursuit is wasted.Glenn Holland may not have been able to write the magnum opus he dreamt of but he did something equally important.

Glenn's life was a symphony Glenn's existence a piece of music and that the film says is worth celebrating.In other words the film is pure cheese. But if you look past all the sentimentality the heavyhanded tear jerking the film has a worthwhile message. It says that teaching art is one thing but living like an artist and inspiring others to do so is an entirely different thing altogether. It's a love letter to beauty and creativity.Beyond this you have a nice performance by Richard Dreyfuss in the lead and ironically some terrible music throughout.

	schema:reviewBody "This is simply a nice dramatic story of a music teacher's life. Richard Dreyfuss plays the teacher Glenn Holland. It spans 30 years of his career with a tearjerking ending. Endearing characters make it a memorable film.The focus of the story is Dreyfuss and three students he gives special time to over the years. A big subplot involves the teacher and his hearingimpaired son. The students are winningly played by Alicia Witt who plays the sweet girl who goes on to become governor Terrence Howard a really nice kid who gets killed in Viet Nam and Jean Louisa Kelly the last and most memorable student perhaps an extremely talented singer who goes on to a career in New York City.Interwoven are some personal stories particularly with Kelly's character and with fellow teachers Jay Thomas playing the most likable and school administrators Olympia Dukakis and William H. Macy. The most personal of course involves his hotcoldhot relationship with his disabled son played by three different actors as time passes. Glenne Headly meanwhile plays Dreyfuss' wife.As you can see by this cast this is a wellacted movie with the only flaw being the screenwriters unable as Hollywood seems to be to control their political bias by giving unwarranted cheap shots to Republican politicians who are pictured as being against the arts atheist John Lennon almost deified in this film as one of the heroes of the 20th century plus a few more digs and plugs here and there all with the normal Liberal bias.Propagandaaside it's a genuinely nice film about people who succeed through dedication to their professions. The movie seemed to appeal to a wide audience. It's very manipulative but it works. It's also a plug if you will for deaf children and the problems they face and the difficulties parents face in raising a kid with that disability.".

Glenne Headly meanwhile plays Dreyfuss' wife.As you can see by this cast this is a wellacted movie with the only flaw being the screenwriters unable as Hollywood seems to be to control their political bias by giving unwarranted cheap shots to Republican politicians who are pictured as being against the arts atheist John Lennon almost deified in this film as one of the heroes of the 20th century plus a few more digs and plugs here and there all with the normal Liberal bias.Propagandaaside it's a genuinely nice film about people who succeed through dedication to their professions. The movie seemed to appeal to a wide audience. It's very manipulative but it works. It's also a plug if you will for deaf children and the problems they face and the difficulties parents face in raising a kid with that disability.";

From What about Bob? to Mr.Holland's Opus we see his incredible range from drama to comedy. He is one of the great character actors of his generation.Dreyfuss really puts his heart into this performance like when he sings to Cole. You can see the sweat on his brow and although he's no John Lennon I thought his singing was pretty good.Also in this age of techno wizadry you can't always trust what you see on the screen but it looked to me like he was actually playing the piano in which case another facet of this talented man.His character agonizes over a potentital relationship with a beautiful and talented student in a midlife crisis but at the end makes the right decision.And the ending it was so moving that even the cast had tears in their eyes and I somehow don't think that was fake.The timeline of events from the 60's to the 90's was also excellent.Overall a beautiful movie and everyone put in a great performance. I thought it had the right balance without getting overly sentimental and sugar coated and evoked a feeling of the times with the music and settings.I take this movie out and watch it every once in a while.".

	schema:reviewBody "Opus literally means work in Latin. And this affecting tale of a man's life work is one of the best made in recent years.The movie starts in the fall of 1965 when Glenn Holland Richard Dreyfuss starts teaching at John F. Kennedy High School which is in the process of being renamed as he arrives. Mr. Holland was playing keyboards with a band but has tired of touring and wants time to settle down and write his own music. He finds teaching to not be much to his liking at first. The kids aren't interested and he doesn't know how to get through to them. In addition his principal Mrs. Jacobs Olympia Dukakis is always on his back as is the Vice Principal Mr. Wolters William H. Macy. His only friend on the faculty turns out to be the football coach Bill Meister Jay Thomas. His complaints to his wife Iris Glenne Headley are met with sympathy at first but when he learns she is pregnant he realizes that he needs this job to support his soon to be larger family. At that point he commits and becomes an excellent teacher learning how to connect to the kinds of music the kids like and relate it back to the classics he is required to teach. Along the way he reaches several students a young clarinet player Alicia Witt a football player Terrence Howard who learns to play the drums in order to keep his GPA high enough to continue to play  an undertaking done at the request of Meister a gifted young singer Jean Louisa Kelly who longs to make music rather than work in her parents business and who develops a bit of a crush on Mr. Holland. His personal life fares a little less well. His only son Cole Nicholas John Renner Joseph Anderson or Anthony Natale depending on the age is born deaf and he can't share his father's love of music. Or so Mr. Holland thinks until he realizes his frustration has shut his son out of his life. Once again he rises to the challenge. However it is only when the music program is cut from the curriculum and Mr. Holland is forced to retire that he realizes what his true life's work has been.It's a brilliant script. Mr. Holland's passion for life  music his work his family  is wonderfully depicted and contrasted against his own limitations in being able to achieve his goals. When faced with his shortcomings he does something about them and in the end triumphs because of it. And having his former students come back and show him how he has influenced their lives is an especially nice touch.The acting is excellent. Dreyfuss is a skilled actor and he brings a warmth to the part that contrasts nicely with Mr. Holland's less appealing characteristics. Headley gives a sweet performance as a woman who loves her family and stands by them no matter what. The scene where she expresses her frustration at not being able to communicate with her son is especially well done. Thomas puts in a nice turn as the football coach. I'm not a big fan of Macy but he does pretty well as the vice principal. Dukakis is nothing short of fabulous as the principal who decides to mentor Mr. Holland whether he wants her to or not.Yes it's a tear jerker of a movie especially the ending. But it's well worth the sacrifice of Kleenex whether it's the first time or the hundred and first. This is a movie that says yes anyone can make a difference in ways they never dreamed of.".

Its disturbing twist on the American dream may be too difficult for someespecially the very dark endingbut that is part of what makes the film such quality fare. Scott B. Smith's screenplay is tight and flawless. Sam Raimi's inspired direction may finally reveal to the rest of the film industry what fans of the Evil Dead trilogy have known for years that though his tongue is often firmly in his cheek Raimi is a fine and grossly underrated filmmaker. Especially impressive is the way he and cinematographer Alar Kivilo approach the snowcovered landscapes. There is an immensity to the frozen wastelands of the film's crucial scenes that is almost worthy of David Lean. Also commendable is Raimi's skillful use of animals among them crows and foxes for symbolic purposes.But the cast not to be outdone by their crew is equally notable. Billy Bob Thornton gives his best performance to date surpassing even his awardwinning role in Sling Blade. Bill Paxton is phenomenal as a straightlacedfamilyman turned sociopath and Bridget Fonda's convincing portrayal of Paxton's determined wife complements him well.Audiences at the screening I saw were commenting on the film's similarities to Fargo as they exited the theater and seemed to belittle A Simple Plan for its lack of originality. Granted A Simple Plan is not entirely original. There are indeed vague shadows of Fargo as well as Macbeth and Robert Frost among others. But there is no such thing as an entirely original work as great art is made by standing on the shoulders of giants. Make no mistake this is NOT a cheap replay of Fargo. The differences are too numerous to note here but suffice it to say that A Simple Plan is a great work in its own right and deserves to be appreciated as such.".

But that just makes this better replies one of the characters.A Simple Plan stars Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton as two Minnesotan brothers Hank and Jacob who find the money with Jake's friend Lou played by Brent Briscoe.The film is directed by Sam Raimi the creator of the Evil Dead movies and there are some suitably macabre and funny Evil Dead touches to this masterpiece although Raimi doesn't botch A Simple Plan up as he did with Sharon Stone's The Quick And The Dead a couple of years ago. This is a restrained delicate Raimi.A Simple Plan instead is on one plane a wry incisive comment on the human condition but it's also a cautionary tale about the evil good men can do.The characters are fascinating. Paxton as Hank is the brainy one of the three. He's been to college and has a wife Bridget Fonda who's just about to have a baby. Jacob is slow and sad with a big touch of goodness about him. His hair is lank his teeth are dirty he's in his thirties and has never had a girlfriend.Jake gets drunk most days and nights with his boozing friend Lou and both are unemployed. The prospect of a ton of money is as unsettling and exciting to this lot as it would be to any honest person who becomes suddenly very rich unexpectedly and illegally. This find is guaranteed to turn their lives up side down.But things take increasingly violent turns until A Simple Plan has the air of a Shakespearian tragedy solidly biased by Hitchcockian twists. Add to this Raimi's weird sense of humour and a Coen Brothers Fargo like frozen air and you have a superb film that will have you laughing uncomfortably as you ponder the extent to which men and women will go nuts and nasty when greed overcomes them.Quite  rightly both Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton are being touted for big acting awards as a result of their work in this marvellous film.".

Here he puts Hitchcock's methods to good use decades after the master died and creates amounts of suspense that honor his memory. The tension is thick and impossible to ignore. This is exciting and engaging and it's completely realistic down to earth and human to boot. The pace is spoton this never outruns the viewer in spite of being fast and tight and so much of the relationships and past being told to us through hints the behaviour and how situations evolve. More thrillers should be like this. This also qualifies as noir and drama. The acting is beyond reproach there's not a single performance that is lacking and I'd say Paxton does pretty good in a lead role. Kudos to Thornton for not turning his part into a caricature. The writing is excellent. I have not read the novel but I would like to do so. I understand that this isn't entirely as brutal as the book though it is disturbing and at times violent. The cinematography and editing are incredible. There is some strong language in this. The story is magnificent and develops so well throughout. Thank you Sam for making an effort for not just going for the lowest common denominator and for understanding that it was the buildup  not purely the plot twist at the end  that made Alfred and his films such treasure. The DVD holds a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to any fan of the director andor anyone else who helped create it. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Hank Jacob and Lou are out for a ride in Hank's truck when they hit a tree. Walking out into the snow they find a crashed plane in the woods with the pilot dead and a bag of money 4 million.  They decide to keep the money and wait to see if anything is mentioned about it.  However as time passes mistrust and betrayal becomes murder as the original simple plan becomes more and more complex.Sam Rami is a great director albeit more well known for less subtle films than this such as the Evil Dead movies.  However here he shows that he can deal with things that lack in OTT visuals etc but be a good subtle director. The basic story starts simply and gets more convoluted very easily.  The plot twists are never absurd even if they are extreme the way the story builds gradually is one of it's strengths.  The best bit is the way that everything is simple as in the title  the snow makes all the scenes a simple white the relationships are simple and the misunderstandings are straight forward.  This simple nature makes the twists even more powerful as they come in the middle of a normal' situation..The cast are all very good.  Paxton is especially good in the lead as the man who doesn't want to take the money originally who then is forced to take the lead in the actions that need doing to cover the crime.  Thornton is the best  he not even that recognizable and he deals with his role really well. He may be a simpleton but he doesn't make it just a cartoon role.  Briscoe is less well defined and Fonda isn't really key to the plot.  Gary Cole has a small part towards the end and Paxton Snr has a small role.Overall this is very enjoyable.  As a noir it is very different to have it in a Fargo landscape.  Rami's toned down direction is very good and he does very well with the exciting twists and with the emotional sections too.  A different sometimes slow but very enjoyable thriller of greed and mistrust.".

Walking out into the snow they find a crashed plane in the woods with the pilot dead and a bag of money 4 million.  They decide to keep the money and wait to see if anything is mentioned about it.  However as time passes mistrust and betrayal becomes murder as the original simple plan becomes more and more complex.Sam Rami is a great director albeit more well known for less subtle films than this such as the Evil Dead movies.  However here he shows that he can deal with things that lack in OTT visuals etc but be a good subtle director. The basic story starts simply and gets more convoluted very easily.  The plot twists are never absurd even if they are extreme the way the story builds gradually is one of it's strengths.  The best bit is the way that everything is simple as in the title  the snow makes all the scenes a simple white the relationships are simple and the misunderstandings are straight forward.  This simple nature makes the twists even more powerful as they come in the middle of a normal' situation..The cast are all very good.  Paxton is especially good in the lead as the man who doesn't want to take the money originally who then is forced to take the lead in the actions that need doing to cover the crime.  Thornton is the best  he not even that recognizable and he deals with his role really well. He may be a simpleton but he doesn't make it just a cartoon role.  Briscoe is less well defined and Fonda isn't really key to the plot.  Gary Cole has a small part towards the end and Paxton Snr has a small role.Overall this is very enjoyable.  As a noir it is very different to have it in a Fargo landscape.  Rami's toned down direction is very good and he does very well with the exciting twists and with the emotional sections too.  A different sometimes slow but very enjoyable thriller of greed and mistrust.";

	schema:reviewBody "A Simple Plan is a film that had immense critical acclaim yet was in limited release.  I was eagerly looking forward to this films release seeing as I am a huge Bill Paxton fan but why wasn't this film in wide release?  I was living in Toronto at the time and to find this film I had to go downtown to one very small art house theater.  It wasn't at any of the bigger Silver City's.  And that is a disappointment.  Because this film is amazing.  In a way  I can't believe I'm saying this  this film reminds me a bit of Star Wars.  Only in the sense that I think there is enough intrigue and well developed characters that you could have made a trilogy and prequels out of this.  Jacob could have a whole movie made about him.  The characters are that rich.The film starts off with two brothers named Hank and Jacob  Paxton and Thorton  and a friend named Lou Brent Briscoe  chasing their dog into the forest.  As they get deep into the woods they stumble onto a downed plane. It is here they find the money the buried treasure to the tune of about 4 million dollars.  At first they are talking about how rich they are and what they are going to do with the money.  But it is then that Hank says that maybe they should wait a while to see if anyone comes looking for the money before they start to spend it.  After all the plane is snow covered so maybe it has been here for a while so by the end of the winter if no one comes for it they will keep it.  The other two are adamantly against that logic.   This is the American dream  one of them says.   You work for the American dream you don't steal it. Hank replies.  Then of course all hell is about to break loose.Suddenly people that lead their lives without much money are consumed with greed and desperation.  Hank's wife Sarah in a great performance by Bridget Fonda says that she is tired of having to eat dessert at home when they go out for dinner.  She wants to provide a nest egg for their soon to be child. Lou owes money to everybody and wants his share of the money now.  Jacob wants to fix up his dads farm.  The insatiable need for money is driving everyone apart.  It is from here that the plot thickens and it is like the layers of an onion.  Every time you peel one layer back there is another layer to deal with until there is nothing left.  And then what happens?This film works because it has a terrific story but it also works because of the people involved with it.  I will first mention Raimi the man responsible for directing this tangled web.  He masterfully strokes every shot perfectly.  He gets the feel for a small cold winter town and he actually makes you shiver inspite of yourself.  If anyone is a true horror fan they would have known that Raimi had a  hidden  genius.  His Evil Dead films  especially the first one  really showed that he could direct a tight film and he did a masterful job of scaring you.  And that is not easy. There are not many truly scary films out there and Evil Dead is one of them.  Here he finally gets his due.The second person I want to mention is the cinematographer.  This is Alar Kivilo's first real foray into film.  He has worked mostly in TV and for this to be as well photographed as it is is a true credit to his ability. Filming in the snow adds many challenges to this aspect of film and he conquers it beautifully.  There is one scene where there are a few men heading into the woods to find the plane and all we see is their footprints. This scene reminded me of a similar one in Lawrence Of Arabia.  It is executed perfectly and it conveys the feeling of what the scene is supposed to represent.As for the actors involved as I said I am a huge Paxton fan just as anyone is if you like his portrayal of Chet and Hudson.  And he is very good in this film.  He has to play the level headed one of everyone involved and he comes across as the torn voice of reason here.  But as much as I thought he was excellent in this flick I have to say that Billy Bob Thorton blew me away.  You can feel his pain.  You can sense his split loyaltyfriendship and brotherhood.  Everything that we are supposed to see in him we do. He really should have won a best supporting actor this year but he had the deck stacked against him seeing that he already has a statue and James Coburn the veteran that he is has none.  Go figure.  Too many politics in the academy but anyway....This film examines so many human issues and it asks us to make our own decisions along the way.  And the sad reality is maybe we wouldn't make some of the same decisions but maybe we would have made worse ones as well. It is a tough movie to examine and that is what ultimately makes it brilliant. Just on a side note here I just find it amazing how the six degrees of separation works here.  Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thorton have known each other for years and they worked together on a similar character study in One False Move. They also briefly had screen time together in Tombstone.   If you can't figure out who Thornton is in that film try thinking of Johnny Tyler.  He was about 100 pounds heavier than what he is now.   Raimi and Paxton met on the set of Indian Summer. Raimi had a small role as Stick. So it is kind of nice to see loyalty does perhaps still exist in Hollywood. And I am really glad they met and then hooked up for this project.  This is a true definition of a great film.".

Bridget Fonda is remarkable in her Lady Macbethtype role.  She's chilling and convincing as the wife who at firsts thinks the money should be burned than changes her mind.  Bill Paxton plays the 'everyman' who is the smarter of the three men who find the money.  He is incredible and holds this film together.  What makes this movie work is that it forces us to ask ourselves questions about our morality.  Not everyone will like the ending.  I think it is perfect.    Number 2 on my top ten of 1998".

	schema:reviewBody "Three guys stumble onto the wreckage of a small plane that happens to contain a stash of cash. What's interesting here is the men's decisionmaking process as unforeseen events intervene in their plan. As their greed overwhelms the men's ethics and common sense their collective predicament just gets worse and what seemed so simple at first becomes more and more complex. The plot does contain some unexpected twists and turns. But the overall story is made possible only because the men are so stupid.Actually I could not identify with any of them. The Jacob character is totally not consistent from one moment to the next. You get the feeling that his inconsistencies are included as a contrivance to keep the plot moving. Billy Bob's performance renders Jacob annoying and grating after about ten minutes. Bill Paxton seems to be on autopilot through most of the film. And the transformation of Bridget Fonda's character is not the least bit believable.The film's cinematography is competent but conventional. Production design seems low budget to me but maybe it's because the story takes place in a rural setting.A Simple Plan renders greed a lot less glamorous than society makes it out to be.

	onyx:emotionText "Three guys stumble onto the wreckage of a small plane that happens to contain a stash of cash. What's interesting here is the men's decisionmaking process as unforeseen events intervene in their plan. As their greed overwhelms the men's ethics and common sense their collective predicament just gets worse and what seemed so simple at first becomes more and more complex. The plot does contain some unexpected twists and turns. But the overall story is made possible only because the men are so stupid.Actually I could not identify with any of them. The Jacob character is totally not consistent from one moment to the next. You get the feeling that his inconsistencies are included as a contrivance to keep the plot moving. Billy Bob's performance renders Jacob annoying and grating after about ten minutes. Bill Paxton seems to be on autopilot through most of the film. And the transformation of Bridget Fonda's character is not the least bit believable.The film's cinematography is competent but conventional. Production design seems low budget to me but maybe it's because the story takes place in a rural setting.A Simple Plan renders greed a lot less glamorous than society makes it out to be. Perhaps that's the film's saving grace. But the characters are all so simpleminded so dimwitted and their decisionmaking skills so moronic the story is just not very credible.";

	schema:reviewBody "If you found four million dollars would you keep it or turn it in? a  character asks his wife in A Simple Plan which documents the events  of two men who choose to do what everyone always says they wouldn't do  but probably really would if they were given the chance.  What chance? A chance to take four million bucks without anyone  knowing who took it or even that it was taken at all. It's just a  simple plan for a simple event. But simple plans can be disastrous as  A Simple Plan tells us in which two brothers named Hank Bill  Paxton and Jacob Billy Bob Thornton discover a duffel bag full of  4400000 in a crashed plane sitting out in the middle of an abandoned  nature preserve. Do they turn it in? Keep it? In a moment of weakness  they choose to do the latter.  Hank's wife Sarah Bridget Fonda is supportive of their decision.  She even tells Hank to return some of the money to the plane to cover  their tracks. When Hank does this it results in the death of a nosy  neighbor on a snowmobile. Soon this tragic chain of events slides into  even more murder and cover ups as one of Jacob's close friends and his  wife die in short because of Hank and his brother.  The town Chief of Police Carl suspects that something fishy is going  on. And when an FBI agent comes to town searching for the plane Hank  has to face the facts that the man may not be from the FBI but instead  might be one of two brothers whose ransom money was lost in the plane  crash.  The film reminds me of the Coen Brothers' amazing Fargo in many  different ways. Most noticeable is the landscape as well as the  quirkiness of the film that lends a realistic tone to it. Also is the  spiraling downfall of the characters  the events trigger one tragic  circumstance after another eventually turning into murder and  doublecrossing and greed.  Billy Bob Thornton turns in another great performance here as Jacob  the lonely guy who has never kissed a girl but fondly remembers the day  that he held hands with a high school babe. His plan is to buy back the  family farm that his father once maintained. But underneath Jacob's  exterior is a heart with little armor. I feel evil he says to Hank  after lying to the police about the death of his friend.  Hank played by Bill Paxton is the prime example of how greed can  corrupt a man. When they find the money it is Hank's firm belief to  turn in the cash and report the plane to the police. He is convinced to  keep the cash since it's probably dirty drug money. Soon he is the man  who is interested in the money more than anyone else. And by the very  end of the film we realize that sometimes people do the worst things  for something they can never even have.  Paxton is one of our greatest actors his credits ranging back to the  days of The Terminator 1984 and Aliens 1986. He's in most of  James Cameron's films including those two mentioned before and  Titanic and Ghosts of the Abyss. He's not exactly one of mainstream  Hollywood's brightest stars but here he proves that he can turn in a  better performance than some of the highest paid actors cough Tom  Cruise cough in cinema history.  The last fifteen minutes of A Simple Plan are tense exciting and  unnerving. This is the type of movie where the hero knows the bad guy  is next to him leading him towards his own death but can't say  anything because then everyone will know that he committed a crime  himself. He has to pretend that he doesn't know the bad guy is a bad  guy. He has to pretend that everything is all right even when he's  being led into a trap. And when the socalled FBI agent Hank Carl and  Jacob split up in the woods to search for the plane I primed myself  for what was to come.  Is this the type of movie where the hero dies or lives? I won't ruin  the surprise. But I think the ending is entirely more meaningful than  it could have been if Sam Raimi the director had chosen a different  route. This is one of the best films of the past decade and certainly  one of the most important.  4.55 stars.   John Ulmer".

And this is what the folks responsible for this film whom have experience in making mostly genre films have done here. I didn't believe this story for one second throughout the entire film. The characters were amazingly stupid. The McGuffin story was uninspired and filled with plotholes so big that you can fly a jumbo jet through them. And the acting except for BBT was unconvincing certainly Paxton and Fonda playing a couple. Talk about zero chemistry. But what's really annoying about A SIMPLE PLAN is that it's supposed to be a tragedy of sorts and yet the filmmakers obviously didn't want to make the film too gloomy and depressing as to turn off most of the audience. The end product is saddled with a conflicting and contradicting styletone. It plays like a harmless  bland TV movie and yet it strives to be John Sayles or Terence Mallick kind of film with its monolithic seriousness.There's only one word to describe A SIMPLE PLAN labored.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers spoilers spoilers...The first thing that drew my attention about a simple plan 1998 was the director's name Sam Raimi the director of a horror movie which became a cultmovie Evil Dead 1981. With a simple plan it is to believe that he decided not to stay confined to the horror movie but to try his hand at other cinema kinds. He chose wisely. We can sum up this movie often compared with Fargo 1996 a movie by the Coen brothers by this sentence how an important amount of money can put an end to a friendship.Sam Raimi is a brilliant detective movie with allusion to Hitchcock the ravens evoke the ones of the birds. Moreover one of them hurts Bill Paxton at the forehead exactly like Tippi Hendren. There's another reference at Hitchcock the body of the dead pilot may evoke the stuffed old woman in Psycho.The success of a simple plan mainly rests on the actors who are cleverly directed Bill Paxton at first sight appears as the most intelligent gut in the trio he is graduated from university. However I felt that Sam Raimi tried to make his weaknesses appear like for instance his anguished side when things don't go as they were planned he tries with difficulty to keep his head and to make things as right as possible. But Paxton has also an easily influenced side. On that subject Bridget Fonda is probably the most interesting character of all the film. I think Raimi during the movie makes us guess that she wants to keep the money for herself and her husband Hank. Nevertheless we could say that she's the one who makes the plot progress and create the situations. She's the one that gives her husband the information about the plane crash and above all she's the one who advises him about the decisions to make. And Paxton obeys her almost blindly. So we can interpret one the last sequences when Paxton throws all the money into the fire like this he managed to free from his wife's influence.But according to me the actor that dominates the cast is arguably Billy Bob Thornton. Of course he didn't act only in good movies. His previous movie was Armageddon 1998 but when he's directed by a stern filmmaker as Sam Raimi the result is conclusive. He's excellent and sometimes very moving in his role of narrowminded and naive man.There's also an outstanding emphasizing of the landscapes which confer to the movie a certain poetry and especially of the snow. Indeed it can be useful to confuse the issue But look! It's going to snow soon! says Paxton to Fonda after this one put a part of the money back into the plane.This movie is ultimately a success mainly thanks to its actors. Highly recommended.".

	onyx:emotionText "Spoilers spoilers spoilers...The first thing that drew my attention about a simple plan 1998 was the director's name Sam Raimi the director of a horror movie which became a cultmovie Evil Dead 1981. With a simple plan it is to believe that he decided not to stay confined to the horror movie but to try his hand at other cinema kinds. He chose wisely. We can sum up this movie often compared with Fargo 1996 a movie by the Coen brothers by this sentence how an important amount of money can put an end to a friendship.Sam Raimi is a brilliant detective movie with allusion to Hitchcock the ravens evoke the ones of the birds.

I was anxious to see every last one of the them dead by the end. END SPOILERS!!!The movie was far too slow and way too long. Most of the footage of Thornton's character babbling nonstop got on my nerves.

The premise is simple three men discover a crashed aeroplane full of money in the woods and instead of alerting the authorities they make what seems to be the notquitemorallywrong decision to keep the cash for themselves.  Their simple plan is just to keep the money at Hank's house until all is clear. But first one thing goes wrong then another and they find themselves committing crime after crime in a hopeless attempt to cover up the crime before.All the twists and turns and fatal errors are presented with such a dreadful earnestness as if Raimi isn't enjoying the story and doesn't want us to enjoy it either.  Odd that this should be so.  Army of Darkness made just five years earlier was a masterpiece of overthetop glee  a tale of treachery selfishness incompetence and necromancy presented with joyful lipsmacking relish.  Here Raimi goes to the other extreme.  The material demands an arch treatment a sense of humour  I mean yes the cruel twists of fate are tragic but they're funny as well  yet Raimi's direction casts a wet blanket over every scene and it's hard to have any fun.  Something tells me too that the film is too long.  In the hands of say Billy Wilder the film would have been snappier and all the better for it.  Some directors have the ability to keep the camera running on sparse drawnout scenes in such a way as to make them fascinating Raimi on the evidence presented here doesn't.What considerable skills Raimi does have often work against the film rather than for it.  Note the scenes in which people get drunk.  Many directors can present people being drunk Raimi can take is INSIDE their drunkenness  but this was a mistake.  Have you ever been drunk in uncongenial company?  There comes a moment when one suddenly becomes disgusted with everything unable to bear one's drinking partners and more profoundly bored than it is possible to be while sober.  That's what several of the characters feel at certain points and that unfortunately is what we feel too.A noble attempt to tell a good story fitfully successful but it just isn't much fun to watch.".

Junebug does it perfectly.At the base the plot follows newlyweds on their trek to NC from Chicago as the wife Madeline goes to close a deal with an eccentric southern painter. While there they decide to stop in and see her husband George's family who comes form NC originally. He has tried to separate himself from that culture and his family altogether. He has been married for six months and his family were not invited to the wedding and his brother holds strong feelings of jealousy against him. It seems hohum form the plot synopsis but then comes Amy Adams as the brother Johnathan's wife and very pregnant Ashley.Amy Adams is absolutely amazing. She brings a charm and wit to this picture when it seems like it is a bit dreary. Her heartwarming turn as an optimistic and young mother to be with a heart of southern gold is achingly warm and sincere. She alone makes the film a must see as she can force the audience from laughter to tears with the flip of a dime.The direction is poetic and the cinematography allows for an unbelievably laid back southern tone. Nothing about this film is rushed and that makes it so wonderful to behold. Seeing how a family can generally and truly love each other inside and because of cultural and societal norms strive to find ways to show love and respect for each other is achingly sincere. Sometimes you as the audience scream for them to communicate especially the brothers as their strife is never discussed or resolved just tolerated.Overall this film is a great cultural study that goes beyond stereotype to show the love and respect the writer and director have for the material and the people of North Carolina. This is a truly warm and comforting piece of southern pleasure that shines in a pool of darkness that is Sundance 2005.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Art dealer Madeleine Embeth Davidtz never better travels to the South meet an Artist about his weird drawings she decides to visit her husband's family whilst she's at it. He hasn't been in correspondence with them for over three years and why that is is left unrevealed. She meets them  her mother in law Celia Weston father in law Scott Wilson brother in law Benjamin Mckenzie and his perky pregnant wife Ashley Amy Adams. Only Ashley extends a warm welcome as everyone else pronounces Madeleine too clever too pretty and too successful to be considered family. Her visit brings some home truths that the family had been putting off. Or waiting for someone to blame on.There is something about Junebug that will surprise everyone. It's not the weird opening sequence where some men randomly shout into space. It's not the surprise of seeing Schindler's List's Embeth Davitz finally get a film role that she deserves. No it is that you are actually impressed by the acting from The O.C.'s Benjamin Mckenzie shortened to Ben here. As Johnny he is a definite sourpuss rude inattentive to his loving wife but perhaps as the film hints just using his rude exterior to hide a feeling of failure inside. Ben Mackenzie makes his character surprisingly well layered revelling in the quietly sad scenes  he tries to tape a show about meercats for his wife but can't and ends up taking it out on her. As his very different brother Alessandro Nivola is as good in his unaffected cheerfulness. Embeth Davidtz shines too in a different role as Madeleine a woman trying constantly to make a good impression but always failing. Her character is given extra depth during her many scenes during Amy Adams especially in their snug little session over her nails. But the film belongs to Amy Adams the actress that brought the film out of obscurity with her Oscar nomination. In Ashley we find liveliness humour and a soul not to be put out easily. Her love for her underachieving husband is touching and each time he knocks her back she fights back playfully covering up her own insecurities which are all revealed in her tragic hospital scene. It was a performance that could have easily been annoying or repetitive but Ashley's spirit is so free Adams' performance perfectly heartfelt.Not much happens plotwise but Junebug is one of those films that are all the better for it. Director Phil Morrison has expertly created a story with real characters out of the petty everyday things. Although scenes with the Artist feel a little underdone though they also play a part in showing the importance of family. Madeleine's visit proves to be unsuccessful not only because she is disliked by her husband's family but because her actions clumsily reveal things about them things that they'd rather not admit to. That Junebug never properly reaches a conclusion merely adds to the film's sophistication but on my part I probably would have liked to see what happens if Madeline and George went back a year later. Because though Ashley had big dreams the sad fact is that they probably all would have gone unfulfilled. Everyone has aspirations and some people can stand in the way of others.B".

	onyx:emotionText "When Art dealer Madeleine Embeth Davidtz never better travels to the South meet an Artist about his weird drawings she decides to visit her husband's family whilst she's at it. He hasn't been in correspondence with them for over three years and why that is is left unrevealed. She meets them  her mother in law Celia Weston father in law Scott Wilson brother in law Benjamin Mckenzie and his perky pregnant wife Ashley Amy Adams. Only Ashley extends a warm welcome as everyone else pronounces Madeleine too clever too pretty and too successful to be considered family. Her visit brings some home truths that the family had been putting off. Or waiting for someone to blame on.There is something about Junebug that will surprise everyone. It's not the weird opening sequence where some men randomly shout into space. It's not the surprise of seeing Schindler's List's Embeth Davitz finally get a film role that she deserves. No it is that you are actually impressed by the acting from The O.C.'s Benjamin Mckenzie shortened to Ben here. As Johnny he is a definite sourpuss rude inattentive to his loving wife but perhaps as the film hints just using his rude exterior to hide a feeling of failure inside. Ben Mackenzie makes his character surprisingly well layered revelling in the quietly sad scenes  he tries to tape a show about meercats for his wife but can't and ends up taking it out on her. As his very different brother Alessandro Nivola is as good in his unaffected cheerfulness. Embeth Davidtz shines too in a different role as Madeleine a woman trying constantly to make a good impression but always failing. Her character is given extra depth during her many scenes during Amy Adams especially in their snug little session over her nails. But the film belongs to Amy Adams the actress that brought the film out of obscurity with her Oscar nomination. In Ashley we find liveliness humour and a soul not to be put out easily. Her love for her underachieving husband is touching and each time he knocks her back she fights back playfully covering up her own insecurities which are all revealed in her tragic hospital scene.

	schema:reviewBody "Phil Morrison has created a film that is among the best I've seen so far in 2005. He has taken a simple country mousecity mouse tale and given it cosmic implications. It is the story of everyone who grew up in the boonies and then gone on to make it big in the big city. It beautifully portrays the embarrassment you feel about taking a worldly spouse back to your small hometown and its pettiness the smallmindedness and envy of the siblings who never left town or made good the reinvention of one's self when one moves to a big metropolis like Chicago. I did NOT feel the Bible Belt North Carolinians were stereotyped as some viewers have remarked I felt they were all portrayed as real people who simply had a tough time articulating their feelings and who were just SIMPLE people...churchgoers family people who have no complexity of emotions or doubts like city people are wont to have. The actress who played the sisterinlaw was brilliant funny and totally believable the mother was the next Gena Rowlands Alessandro Nivola and the girlfriend were extremely appealing ciphers which they were supposed to be and the unrestrained horror of their having to return to this small Southern town was so palpable that it made watching the film very uncomfortable at times especially if a viewer's own life resembles that of the main characters'. Deliberately underwritten beautifully paced it is one to remember savor and wind up at the Festivals. Bravo!".

	schema:headline " A Prodigal Son Has More Baggage At Home Than He Brings With Him";
	schema:reviewBody "Junebug is a ruefully sweet cleareyed take on the going home genre that usually takes the form of prodigal child returning due to a funeral or serious illness with guilt hanging in the air until it ignites an explosion. Instead debut writer Angus MacLachlan has brought George home to North Carolina as a coincidence of his new wife's job and life has gone on without him and will continue when he's gone again. Debut director Phil Morrison does a lovely job of visually establishing how each person in the family has staked out their physical space and roles within the family even as sounds and light uncomfortably carry through the walls and beyond the rooms. I haven't seen every inch of a normal house used as a movie setting so intensively since The Brothers McMullen complete with blowing up an air mattress in the nursery. Those scenes contrast with how different the family members are outside that house such as the sullen angry brother Benjamin McKenzie perking up comfortably with his fellow warehouse workers and George easily fitting back into a church service. While the usual is to have the spouse's estranged family be colorfully ethnic or straightlaced WASP as a comic contrast a la the Meet the Fockers mode here they are complicated rural folk and are not condescended to even as no good deed goes unpunished. Both sides receive their share of mockery and sympathy from the story everyone's hypocrisy and humanity are revealed and at least two scenes bring tears to the eyes one touching and the other sad. While everyone is speaking English the miscommunications abound though it is a bit heavyhanded to have the Englishbred wife coach the brother on Huckleberry Finn let alone her bizarre negotiations with a probably crazy local artist. Each either takes a comment too literally or misinterprets passive aggressive silences what people don't say comes to be more important than what they do say as even Amy Adams' wonderfully chatty character is warmheartedly mature and caring. The big annoying weakness of the film and keeps it from being a satisfying film is the vague character of the prodigal son. While it seems that his older folk art collecting wife probably lusted after him at first sight because he was the first cute straight guy who walked into her gallery and I assume there is some significance that he buys the painting that doesn't make him happy their quickie marriage seem to be based only on newlywed randiness as everything seems to turn them on. Taking after his father busy woodworking away in the basement he pretty much sloths out in the house or car so it is confusing hypocrisy when he suddenly steps up to the plate in an emergency accuses his wife of not putting family first and then bails on the follow up. Alessandro Nivola well portrays a literal golden boy who is of course his mother's heart's delight and in her eyes can do no wrong even he acknowledges that his new wife is bound to discover his faults though people who have different positions in their families may interpret the sibling behaviors in different ways. But the film only shows us how people react to him and very little about him other than his casual sense of entitlement though the mostly silent guy to guy communication is realistic.Other than one superbly beautiful hymn sung by Nivola he also sang well as rock star in Laurel Canyon the soundtrack does not take the T. Bone Burnett traditional songs approach but instead has a score by Hoboken NJ's own Yo La Tengo that doesn't take sides between the country or the big city.".

	schema:reviewBody "Junebug Reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.comRating 3.5 out of 4There's a magic to Junebug that's nearly impossible to describe with words. To explain it literally would be to describe a slow mundane and worthless story. But of course there's much more to Junebug than a story that's slow mundane and worthless. Iconic independent director Phil Morrison's film takes a patient and immersive look at small town life. There's a profound harmony at work between the characters that from my experience with small town family in relatives' homes seems to be true to reality. All at once each character is happy and unhappy with their situation and with everyone surrounding them. There's pain but within the pain is deeprooted happiness and content. And when a foreigner enters the home as new family we the audience are meant to take the foreigner's perspective.After meeting George Alessandro Nivola at her art gallery's auction Madeleine Embeth Davidtz finds herself married to the man after little over a week. Months later she travels into a rural suburbia of South Carolina to meet with the peculiar and absurdly profound artist David Wark Frank Hoyt Taylor and also to meet for the first time her new family. Unfamiliar with the family's southern lifestyle she enters the house with the open mind unique only to artists. Immediately embraced by the lonely Ashley Amy Adams whose relationship to Johnny Benjamin McKenzie has yielded a seemingly unhappy pregnancy and lonely marriage Madeleine is equally repelled by the mother and leader of the household Peg Celia Weston. Each couple the parents Ashley and Johnny and Madeleine and George sleeps in a separate room divided only by paper thin walls that do little to contain sound making nights into festivals of eavesdropping. The unborn baby Junebug has a room all to herself seeming to hold all hope that is left for happiness in the family. In most films where a foreigner enters a deeprooted household the story usually loses itself with the dramatic changes the foreigner brings. But Phil Morrison thankfully avoids this clich and instead lets our foreigner simply observe. There's actually a sequence dedicated entirely to the observation of each room in the home where we like the foreigner are meant to find all the charming nuances of the house's decoration. Meticulous details are fully realized with the placement of the cigarettes the oddly shaped and colored lampshades the material of the couches and every tiny element of this lifestyle that may be new to all us city folk. The foreigner actually has as little power over the family as the audience does. Instead of her acting as the catalyst for the family's change the title character Junebug who's kicking and growing within Ashley's stomach holds this power. It's an affective storytelling method that allows us to connect with the foreigner Madeleine and consequently find ourselves immersed further into Junebug's intimate tale. In a story as quiet and intimate as Junebug it's imperative that body language plays as much a role as dialogue. The cast must exude emotions past words and extend their skills to inhabit their characters completely. Each actor achieves this rare performance particularly Amy Adams and Benjamin McKenzie playing Ashley and Johnny. Their marriage has a unique understanding to it that's difficult for the audience to grasp until the end. But when we realize their situation the nuances of their performances are blissfully revealed. Conventional laws of cinema rarely allow small town life to be realistically portrayed. The calm resonating harmony that resides in the lifestyle doesn't offer much in the way of excitement. I suppose it requires the confidence of an independent distributor and the eye and pen of a wonderful director and screenwriter. Phil Morrison and Angus MacLachlan's collaboration here with Junebug offers up this unique portrait with nothing but extreme and satisfying clarity. Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com".

The message that you can't go home again is universal but the home to which the main character cannot return is rich with welldefined and believable characters.George Alessandro Nivola a man from North Carolina has moved to Chicago and married Madeleine Embeth Davidtz a sophisticated art gallery owner. She learns from her scouts of an undiscovered primitive artist who lives near George's family. They take this opportunity to drive to North Carolina where Madeleine meets her husband's family for the first time. George's family consists of a strongwilled mother Celia Weston a loving but extremely quiet father Scott Wilson a brooding ne'erdowell younger brother Benjamin McKenzie and a perky notsobright golden hearted sisterinlaw Amy Adams.On the surface nothing separates this film from hundreds of others with the same basic plot line  be they comedies or dramas. What gives it a five star rating is its ability to depict a depth of character and a location too rarely seen in small films.I would not classify this film as a comedydrama. Because I hail from the South the comedy that most critics see in the characters and situations appear just as normal occurrences to me. Of course  as in life  there are moments of humor but what takes place amongst the main characters of this film cannot in any way be considered comedy. This is sad tale of the inability of those who genuinely love and respect each other to communicate those feelings.Even though most of the action revolves around the family I should mention the artist Frank Hoyt Taylor. This man is a real character in every sense of the word. He is a man of apparently limited mental ability who must have been struck in the head early on by a Bible and a huge phallus. You really have to see the work of the artist in order to understand the previous statement. As a matter of fact his paintings might realistically be considered another character in the film.The extras on the DVD added greatly to my enjoyment of this movie. The features about the making of it were short but informative but I liked the deleted scenes even more. I usually can see why scenes have been cut from a film but some of those deleted from Junebug add powerfully to understanding the characters  especially the mother and father. It's worth your time to view these scenes.No matter whether you view Junebug as a comedydrama or as a sad almost tragic drama you'll be rewarded with an insightful and entertaining tale.".

	schema:reviewBody "Junebug is one of the best independent movies that has been released recently. Phil Morrison the director is clearly a new voice in the cinema to be reckoned with. His immensely satisfying Junebug has the power to make the viewer gets absorbed into the drama he presents to his audience. Based on a screen play by Angus MacLachlan the film is a pleasant surprise.If you haven't seen the film perhaps you should stop reading here.At the start of the film we are taken to Madeleine's gallery in Chicago where an art auction is taking place. The lovely Madeleine is seen behind the scenes when she suddenly happens to catch sight of George who happens to be at the event. We are aware of Madeleine's lust for the handsome George and as fate would have it they get married.When Madeleine decides to go to visit one eccentric painter in North Carolina a visit to George's family is in order. The contrast between the worldly Madeleine and her new inlaws is something we realize right away. The mother Peg is a controlling woman who presides over the big household. She is weary of strangers as she perceives Madeleine to be. The father Eugene is a taciturn man who clearly wants to stay away from his wife hiding in the basement where he carves animal figures that we never get to see. Johnny the other son seems to be resentful of his brother for having left home. His wife Ashley is the only person who seems to be happy or at least adjusted to her situation and surroundings.The basic trouble with this family is that they don't communicate. Nothing is ever heard about what has made them grow apart. There is no warmth whatsoever from Peg toward anyone at all. In fact for being this a Christian family they exhibit no kindness toward Madeleine who tries to connect with them to no avail. Johnny misreads his new sisterinlaw's kindness with sexuality which is clearly not the case. It's only Ashley the simple girl with a heart of gold who seems to be having some semblance being well adjusted in spite of the coldness of her new home.Amy Adams and Embeth Davidtz who play Amy and Madeleine respectively give amazing portrayals of these two opposite women. Ms. Adams is one of the best things in the film because she hasn't been touched by whatever is making the rest of the family so miserable. Embeth Davidtz one of the best young actresses working in film and in the theater these days gives a graceful account of Madeleine a woman of a different background who is accepting and wants to be accepted by her new family.The rest of the cast is well balanced. Benjamin McKenzie is seen as the frustrated Johnny who is clearly an unhappy man living with his family. Alessandro Nivola has a great moment when he is asked to sing a hymn at a church gathering. Celia Weston makes Peg into a mystery as we can't conceive her reaction toward the woman who married George and can't accept her. Scott Wilson is the father.Junebug is a film that will stay with the viewer for quite a long time after it's finished. Mr. Morrison makes us get involved in the situation he is presenting for us. Clearly not a film for the great masses but it will gratify fans of this type of indie that shows a director who clearly has things under control and is not afraid to get the viewer involved in the story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Junebug is a great movie mainly because it is one of the few films that blends comedy and drama so well. Easily one of the best Sundance films of recent memory you can't help but be drawn in by Junebug's simple yet alluring story which is aided by excellent performances from Amy Adams and Ben McKenzie.Art gallery owner Madeleine Embeth Davidtz Schindler's List Matilda glimpses a man George Johnsten Alessandro Nivola Jurassic Park III at an art auction and it's love at first sight. The two soon marry and after Madeleine goes to North Carolina to visit a brilliant yet eccentric artist David Wark Frank Hoyt Taylor they decide to make a stop at George's family's house. Here we meet the rest of the cast George's mom and dad Celia Weston and Scott Wilson his gruff and quiet younger brother Johnny Ben McKenzie The O.C. and Johnny's upbeat cute and very pregnant wife Ashley Amy Adams The Wedding Date. What we see throughout is Ashley's immediate liking of Madeleine an increase in the anger and frustration of Johnny and a continued disapproval from George's parents.The movie really draws you in to the lifestyle of a southern family and I know this because I've lived in Florida for 17 years not the beachy part the country part. Those who live like the Johnsten's will completely identify with the characters thus exploiting another charismatic directing technique from the film's director Phil Morrison. That technique is to provide a character that the audience can identify with and that is accomplished everywhere the quiet father the controlling and worrisome mother the gruff and shadowed younger brother the pretty boy older brother the energetic and fun girl and the shy sweet and pretty new lady. All or most of these sorts of people cross a person in everyday life which makes them so much more of an attraction.What really adds even more spice to the chicken is the standout performances from the film's two youngest stars. Amy Adams stands out in every scene she is in. For the first half of the movie which is mostly comedic you can't help but laugh at how sweet thoughtful and harmlessly cute Adams portrays Ashley as. Adams deserves her Oscar nomination 100. Ben McKenzie is a talented actor there's no question to that. But when your only claim to fame is a teenage dramatic soap opera you can't really brag too much. McKenzie lights up the screen as Johnny and delivers a very believable performance as a young man who is unsure about and probably not ready for fatherhood. As Adams takes over the first half of the movie's comedy McKenzie takes the second half of the movie's drama into his hands.The rest of the cast is definitely great and it was nice to see Embeth Davidtz again hadn't seen her since Matilda!. Alessandro Nivola definitely showed a side to his acting ability that really couldn't be seen in Jurassic Park III and he has a bright future ahead of him as well...he reminds me of a younger Ralph Fiennes. Celia Weston and Scott Wilson two seasoned actors of theater and film shine in this as George's parents.Junebug is a wonderful film that has got classic written all over it. Director Phil Morrison has done a great job on this one and the screenplay from first time writer Angus MacLachlan is topnotch. I recommend this to anyone who is ready for a relaxing movie that will definitely be a pleasure to watch.810 spy".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a former Upright Citizens Brigade director Phil Morrison fares much better here than Peyton Reed did with The BreakUp. Morrison shows true heart here with a lot going on as city life clashes with the country. He deftly handles the characters' interactions with each other and the differences that both worlds have on issues such as trust. Whereas Madeleine a world traveler and educated successful woman can have all the trust in the world for her husband's southern family and artist she is courting on business they see her as someone wanting something. They can't trust her because she is an outsider her kindness must be masking some ulterior motive. Embeth Davidtz as Madeleine portrays this conflict perfectly she is a strong person and outgoing to a fault however her touchyfeely attitude is construed as being sexual having a sense of entitlement and betterment to her lesser and a devil in sheeps clothing mantra. Her husband George played with nice duality between old and new world attitudes by Alessandro Nivola knows she is just a nice caring woman but his family is very conservative and not easily swayed to open themselves to strangers.Even though there is not much in the way of plot newly married couple go down to the groom's family's house while the bride tries to secure a lucrative art deal with a painter. While there each side turns the other's life upside down causing a need for change and compromise that just isn't as possible as one might think Chicago and North Carolina are very far apart. This story is just the bottom layer of many as each actor adds nuance and feeling driving every minute to its final conclusion of the couple going back north to their home. Davidtz is stunning as the strongwilled woman who while thinking these simpleminded folk will be easy to mold to her needs discovers it is she who is out of her element and nave to the ways of love and family. Benjamin McKenzie is powerful as the troubled Johnny who is full of both love and resentment for those around him. He knows his limitations and gets angry when others try to better him because he feels condescended to. His stubbornness won't allow anyone to get close to him as any instance of compassion is seen as belittlement. Johnny loves his wife as seen in the meerkat scene yet can't allow her inside his emotions.Frank Hoyt Taylor is great as the link between worlds for Madeleine. He is the real reason she is there as she wants the rights to distribute his Outsider Art crude vulgar yet emotionally powerful paintings of war. Taylor plays him as a simple man slightly touched with dementia yet longing for what he knows. He does not care about the money or the fame he creates for himself and God and that is something a gallery director trying to outbid a NYC establishment can never understand. While Madeleine believes she is going to take care of him in the art world she just can't see that the only way to do that would be to let him alone and leave him to do his work in peace without prying eyes watching. These southerners live for the land and their families not material gains shown most effectively by the father Eugene played by Scott Wilson. He realizes that people aren't what they initially appear to be and has the most open mind to the thought of his son's quick courtship to marriage. Also he knows that some things are sacred to those he can trust like his woodworking skills and his wife's knitting. These are skills on par with Taylor's painting and he doesn't want them to be exploited as he is.The real heart and soul of the film however lies inside Amy Adams' Ashley. She is full of life naivete and love. Her pregnancy is seen by her as the act that will save her troubled husband from the funk he's been in for the past two years. Maybe a little joy is all that is needed for Johnny to once again see the world as good and not a series of hardships that forced him to quit high school and support his spouse. Adams is full of hope and trust for all those that enter her life. She is the only one to see Madeleine as a human being and not a monster trying to ruin what was left of their family. Probably holding the most insight of anyone she carries the rest of the film on her shoulders as well as those of her unborn child. That baby will change everyone for either good or bad. George realizes this and knows that he must stick by his family no matter what happens. He also knows that his wife is not quite able to do that as the educated life she lived has made her somewhat cold to the bigger picture of things. Once the climax surrounding Adams' character is revealed the viewer gets to see what the real makeup of each person truly is.Junebug is a revelation of sorts. One cannot leave the film without having been changed in some small way by the proceedings. Emotions run high and family values are tested. Morrison has crafted a lyrical poem of life with a scarce but powerful palette. Even the tranquility of the trees in the North Carolina backyard is a sight to be ingrained in your consciousness. The quiet holds both joy and pain in its silence.".

Throughout the film there are occasional shots of empty rooms silent streets and dark woods that are at odds with the message conveyed by the action. Generally we are treated to contrasting images a room filled with people is followed by a shot of the same room empty and silent. A church parking lot devoid of people followed by the same scene filled with noise and celebration. The dark woods beyond the deck appear sinister. I got the distinct feeling that the filmmaker wished to suggest that the laughter and interaction of this family was a fragile veneer. Just beneath the surface was a terrible emptiness that could not be disguised by gaudy art wood paneling and the celebration of family rituals. Although the majority of this wonderful film gave a warm and affectionate treatment of this Southern family these brief images of silence and emptiness are like teasing glimpses of the skull beneath the flesh. Did anyone else get the same reaction?".

I thought the film was very funny at timesnot cheap funny but the goofy oops hoofinmouth moments when we try too hard or miss the cues. The look on Madeline's face in the screwdriver conversation! This movie left so much to think about. That is film as art when the conversation with it continues in our heads.";

	schema:reviewBody "None of the first 20 user reviews properly understood this movie.Critical to deducing out what's going on in the plot is of course understanding why the movie is titled as it is ... Junebug. A Junebug appears for a very short time in the middle of summer flits around above the grass reproduces and then disappears until next year. It's just concerned with it's own life finding a mate and having sex.The two visitors George and Madeline are Junebugs. They pop up in the middle of Junebug season in North Carolina to see George's family for a brief visit primarily not to see the relatives but for Madeline to sign up a new painter for her art gallery. They are just like the temporary insect visitors. The fascinating element is that at first Madeline and George appear to be the one's who have it together emotionally speaking. They appear to both express how they feel without problems to be the same on the surface as they are underneath i.e. their real personalities seem to be expressed openly.Whereas when we meet George's family and friends and neighbours in N.C. they seem to be the weirdest bunch of suppressed individuals you could possibly meet! However as the movie progresses you start to realize in the most wonderfully understated way that the opposite is actually the case.Slowly but surely you begin to understand that it is the North Carolinian family and friends who know and understand each other on a level and with a true depth that George and Madeline could only wish for. Some examples? Both George and Madeline smoke cigarettes but both keep it a secret from each other. A very basic element of both their lives is a secret. Madeline doesn't even know that George likes loads of mayonnaise on his sandwiches and that he likes to play road games in the car and that he cheats in the games.George doesn't realize that Madeline isn't as bound up in her career as an art dealer as he suspects instead she becomes emotionally involved in his family's issues and problems. He misunderstands this during the scene in the hospital where he tells her over the phone that family is important. In fact she is more aware of this than he is. During this last scene in the car where they are returning to their Northern city life it is George who says Hey I'm glad to be out of there. Yet it is Madeline who has been more deeply changed and affected by the events she has witnessed among George's family.It is they who turn out to be the Junebugs involved in George's family life for a brief short time and they will probably return the next year for another fleeting flitting visit. Instead it is the family who seemed so out of touch with each other initially who turn out to be the ones with the ongoing commitment to each other through good and bad despite their flaws and problems. The family members are the ones who really understand and communicate with each other on a level that George wants to avoid by leaving again and although Madeline has realized some of this internally she is also leaving to return to her allconsuming career. They both choose to leave real communication behind in N.C. with George's family.There are so many hidden aspects that speak of this underlying plot throughout the movie that I can't mention them all here. But some are George and Madeline's sex life which is graphically portrayed. It seems that they are very much like the Junebugs here to have sex and procreate and then come back to do the same next year. That's all they seem to do true communication is out the window. Another is when Madeline finds Eugene's screwdriver hidden under some furniture just before she is about to leave and go home. It's as if she has finally discovered something about what Eugene is looking for in his life but chooses to flit off after she discovers it. I could go on including the very brief scene of the Junebugs flitting above the grass in the garden but I'll let you find the others yourself.Happy flitting! A true 9 out of 10 movie. Very enjoyable and profound.".

Some viewers look forward to that and are pleased when everything including the kitchen sink is not forced into a script. The strength of this film is the interface between characters. I found them quirkily individual enough to be believable. Amy Adams positively inhabits the role of a strong faithful but childish young mother and her interactions with an intellectual worldly professional sisterinlaw are touching and funny. The interactions between the controlling Southern mother with her silent but wise husband and her redneck son are credible and well enough written. Also there is a somewhat crazy but highly inspired visionary artist....and that is a frightening and accurate portrayal. Unfortunately there are character inconsistencies and the film does seem to linger in the sadder aspects of the story more than I would've liked especially for a movie whose comic bits were so strongly done. It is not a broad comedy but an investigation of goals and faith done through a brilliant cast who make you chuckle. Afterwards the humor and heartache portrayed by Amy Adams' character is so wonderfully written and acted I wished for a whole film just about her.".

And as you ride along w Madeleine and feel the contrast of her worldly experience in this provincial environment you'll connect w these Southern characters and at the same time you'll struggle w this place and particularities of their personalities.And the personalities are the real rave of the film and the acting that brings those characters to you and the depth of those parts. As the plot develops you'll write off some characters only to have them grow on you as you learn more. You'll love someone and then see some aspect of them that breaks your vision of who they are. None of these players are especially famous but all play their parts so perfectly. Madeline and her persistent sunniness is the spotlight that allows you to truly see the other roles. And Amy Adams portrayal of Ashley is particularly incredible... it's not that the character comes across as totally likable it's that she's so real and so rich flaws and all. She's brilliantly attractive and repulsive at the same time... and that may be a fair metaphor for the film in general. There's a push and pull here that is quite compelling and hard to forget.This movie is off the beaten path in it's topic and it's psychology. It is sticking w me like a dream before waking... leaving me with w dramatically intense images that keep the film's quiet mood at play in my mind.I don't think that George Johnsten's North Carolina home is a place I'd actually like to visit but having been there I miss it now.Strange simple film but absolutely worth seeing.".

Yet George at one point remarks to his Chicago wife family is important and that statement is the most powerful in the movie. Although I moved away from North Carolina my heart and my soul have never left that culture as fractured as it is.

In the course of her visit she learns that everyone in her husband's family has an artistic streak which is unremarked but taken for granted her husband sings in church which she never suspected his father does woodwork and so on.The film suggests that in their unhighflown way they may be more at home with themselves than the wife or her husband. The wife being from the city appreciates the country as epitomized in the eccentric's paintings from a perspective unavailable and incomprehensible to its natives and in the end she's desperate to get back to New York. The husband who breaks with her over the primacy of family was the one who left his family in the first placeand is glad to leave again. We're left to muse over who's right or wrong who's being wise or foolish and to conclude that the balance beam hovers somewhere in the middle.At the center of the story is the other daughterinlaw whose name for her unborn child gives the film its title an indefatigable optimist who appears to be all smiles and chatter and inability to think anything but the best of everybody. Amy Adams's performance is one of the best ever recorded on film accurately observed and totally in tune with the character true and comic and touching. The DVD includes excerpts from the actress's audition which show what a clearsighted flexible and disciplined artist she is. She's the heart of the film. In one ambiguous scene the film suggests she isn't so gormless as she acts and in the end when she gives way to darker feelings it implies that starryeyed uplift isn't a birth defect but her chosen road. Adams's playing is beautifulthere's no other word for it.For a woeful contrast compare her in this and in the Disney film Enchanted where she plays something like the same part to see the difference between a fine actor's ability when given full rein and when it has had to be harnessed to the demands of the mass market. Like any good film this one has more in it than a description can do justice to. In it the writer and the director achieved a small masterwork.

One of the most spectacular and renowned conductors of the 1930s Furtwangler's reputation rivalled that of Toscanini's. After the war he was investigated as part of the Allies' deNazification program. In the bombedout Berlin of the immediate postwar period the Allies slowly bring law and order and justice to bear in an occupied Germany. An American Major is given the Furtwangler file and is told to find everything he can and to prosecute the man ruthlessly. Tough and hardnosed Major Steve Arnold sets out to investigate a world of which he knows nothing. Orchestra members vouch for Furtwangler's morality. He did what he could to protect Jewish players from his orchestra. To the Germans deeply respectful of their musical heritage Furtwangler was a demigod to Major Arnold he is just a lying weakwilled Nazi.";

Why did the Americans attack Furtwngler and not von Karajan who was an ardent Nazi? Furtwngler was prevented from conducting in the U.S. while von Karajan was lionized. Perhaps the makers of this film thought that the implications of this were too big to be discussed in the film. I'm sure that they didn't even want to go near the fact that the people who ran the denazification program were Americans with close ties to the Nazis themselves.Also Furtwngler's rationale for staying in Germany was somewhat more philosophical than the film implies. He thought he was defending the legacy of Mozart Beethoven et al against the Nazis and that this was a sacred responsibility. A bit of this comes out in the film but in a superficial way.With respect to the success of the film otherwise Stellan Skarsgaard is excellent as Furtwngler even managing to resemble him somewhat. I think that Harvey Keitel is somewhat hampered by the script  the film would have been more successful if Keitel had come off as more conflicted and less onedimensional. Clearly the director wished to imply that Keitel was conflicted but that as a military man he was required to toe the line  the frequent shots of Army indoctrination films about how bad the Germans were were intended to provide a rationale for Keitel's behavior. But the film would have been more compelling if Keitel were given an opportunity to express more doubts about what he was being asked to do. I also thought that the ending was a bit anticlimactic.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are two constituencies for director Istvan Szabo's Taking Sides a story of famed conductor and not so well known composer Wilhelm Furtwangler's accountability for his actions in Germany and occupied Europe during World War II. One is a relatively small coterie of devoted classical music lovers few of whom are old enough to have ever seen the maestro conduct but who know his penetratingly brilliant conducting through recordings. The larger audience is attracted to unending and largely unresolvable issues of good versus evil and the degree to which one is responsible for the atrocities committed by a society but not by the individual who serves some of its needs.Wilhelm Furtwangler was a worldheralded conductor before World War II. Along with a handful of European podium titans  Mengelberg Walter Klemperer and Toscanini  these men in essence controlled classical music both with regard to concert programming and the rapidly developing technological advances of the phonograph disc.With the rise of fascism some conductors composers and musicians fled the grasp of tyrannous regimes. A few like Toscanini had little choice a beating administered by Italian thugs as payment for his refusing to honor Mussolini from the stage was a fair indication that New York offered better prospects. Walter and Klemperer decamped their careers boosted by their strong antiNazi stances.

Furtwangler may not have known of extermination camps and he certainly hurt no Jews indeed the record is clear that he saved some Jewish musicians as did Mengelberg but he must internally have abhorred the Nazi extinction of music by composers such as Mendelssohn and contemporary composers whose works were denounced as entartete musik degenerate music. And more than a few of the composers in the latter class were murdered during the regime. Furtwangler definitely knew that composers and musicians disappeared with no forwarding addresses.Keitel and Skarsgard act out a morality inquisition that does provoke the viewer to think and question but the ultimate issue should Furtwangler have fled is irritatingly vague. Did Furtwangler take sides in any meaningful sense? Did he stay beyond the point where leaving was an option? Maybe. Can we should we expect composers and conductors to be like Leonard Bernstein outspoken advocates on every issue? Is that fair?German conductors had powerful patrons and without doubt Furtwangler's brilliant conducting served the interests of both the leaders and audiences that hungered through bombings and the approach of defeat for some relief through music. I have a recording of Furtwangler conducting Beethoven's magisterial Ninth Symphony in Berlin where antiaircraft fire and bombs can be heard. What did it take for Londoners and Berliners to listen to great music at their imminent mortal peril? Taking Sides could have explored the almost mystical relationship between Furtwangler and his audiences. It doesn't really do that although the adulation in which he was held is depicted.A very fine biography by Shirakawa The Devil's Musician largely rescues Furtwangler from accusations of sympathy with the Nazi regime and he clearly was a much finer fellow than his young rival Herbert von Karajan. Von Karajan was destined to be a great conductor but he was also a firstclass careerist who joined the Nazi party to advance his prospects and lied about it for years until confronted with the evidence.Anyone seriously interested in classical music during the Third Reich must read Douglas Kater's threevolume wellwritten and extensively researched history of that period. For now Taking Sides is good but not great drama. Selections of music by Bruckner and Beethoven as well as by Glenn Miller and George Gershwin the latter two decidedly not Nazi favorites are prominent. Hopefully the movie will impel those unfamiliar with an unsurpassed interpreter of wonderful music to seek out readily available and gripping recordings.710.".

	onyx:emotionText "There are two constituencies for director Istvan Szabo's Taking Sides a story of famed conductor and not so well known composer Wilhelm Furtwangler's accountability for his actions in Germany and occupied Europe during World War II. One is a relatively small coterie of devoted classical music lovers few of whom are old enough to have ever seen the maestro conduct but who know his penetratingly brilliant conducting through recordings. The larger audience is attracted to unending and largely unresolvable issues of good versus evil and the degree to which one is responsible for the atrocities committed by a society but not by the individual who serves some of its needs.Wilhelm Furtwangler was a worldheralded conductor before World War II. Along with a handful of European podium titans  Mengelberg Walter Klemperer and Toscanini  these men in essence controlled classical music both with regard to concert programming and the rapidly developing technological advances of the phonograph disc.With the rise of fascism some conductors composers and musicians fled the grasp of tyrannous regimes. A few like Toscanini had little choice a beating administered by Italian thugs as payment for his refusing to honor Mussolini from the stage was a fair indication that New York offered better prospects. Walter and Klemperer decamped their careers boosted by their strong antiNazi stances. Mengelberg collaborated essentially ruining his career when victory came his is a complex case still debated.Furtwangler with many opportunities to leave didn't.

	schema:headline " Dressed in a little brief authority";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1946 Wilhelm Furtwngler one of Germany's greatest musicians and the conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic was put on trial before a denazification tribunal even though he was a member of neither the German government nor the Wehrmacht. He was not accused of war crimes indeed he was not accused of any crimes in the normal meaning of the term. He was never a member of the Nazi Party made little secret of his dislike for them and always refused to give the Nazi salute. He assisted several Jewish musicians to leave the country. The Allied authorities however were well aware of the symbolic importance of culture especially music in German life and were determined to land a big fish. Furtwngler was charged with supporting Nazism by remaining in Germany performing at Nazi party functions and with making antiSemitic remarks.Furtwngler was eventually cleared of all these charges and allowed to resume his musical career but even so he still remained suspect in many people's eyes. He was not for example allowed to conduct in America after the war. To me this has always seemed unfair given that there were other eminent musicians who were enthusiastic Nazis such as his younger rival Herbert von Karajan who actually joined the Nazi Party in his native Austria in 1933 at a time when that party was looked on with extreme disfavour by the country's authoritarian but antiNazi government. Even Arturo Toscanini hailed as an antiFascist hero after he left Italy in 1931 was himself once a Fascist who in 1919 stood unsuccessfully as one of the party's parliamentary candidates.Istvan Szabo also directed Mephisto another film about an artist in that case an actor who compromises with the Nazis in order to continue working in Germany. The theme may have some personal relevance for Szabo himself as he worked in Hungary under the Communist regime. Taking Sides based upon Ronald Harwood's stage play imagines Furtwngler's pretrial interrogation by Major Steve Arnold an American officer. Most of the film takes place in Arnold's office an appropriately claustrophobic setting which perhaps betrays its origins in the theatre although we also see shots of the ruins of Berlin outside. There is one very effective scene of a classical concert taking place in a ruined church.Arnold is in many ways unsuitable for the task to which he has been assigned. He is a philistine ignorant of classical music. He refers to Furtwngler as a bandleader and when asked which is his favourite Beethoven symphony replies the eleventh. Upon being told that Beethoven only wrote nine he claims unconvincingly to have been joking. In civilian life he was an insurance investigator and he has some similarities to the cynical character played by Edward G Robinson in Double Indemnity who automatically suspects all insurance claims of being fraudulent. That film is briefly mentioned here. Arnold takes a strong dislike to Furtwngler whom he suspects of being a fraud and a hypocrite and bullies him mercilessly.Furtwngler however does have three surprising allies all of whom have perhaps more cause to hate the Nazis than Arnold does Arnold's Russian counterpart Colonel Dymshitz his young assistant Corporal David Wills ne Weill a German Jew forced to flee to the US from the Nazis and his German secretary Emmi whose father was executed for his part in the plot to overthrow Hitler. Dymshitz unlike Arnold is a music lover although he has seen his homeland devastated by the Nazi invasion he has lived under Stalin and therefore understands the compromises that need to be made with a totalitarian regime. Wills and Emmi take objection to Arnold's bullying of Furtwngler which remind them of Gestapo interrogation tactics.There are two excellent performances in the leading roles. Stellan Skarsgard's Furtwngler is a saddened disillusioned man who has realised too late the evil of which his political masters were capable. Yet he defends his decision to remain in Germany as a champion of the humane enlightened values of high culture at a time when those values were under attack like never before to continue playing the music of Beethoven Mozart and Schubert at a time when the German people most sorely needed to hear it.Harvey Keitel's Arnold is a classic example of the little man given too much power. Perhaps this type was best described by Shakespeare in Measure for Measure the man dressed in a little brief authority who like an angry ape plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven as make the angels weep. Some have complained that Harwood Szabo and Keitel load the dice in Furtwngler's favour by making Arnold too unpleasant. Had he been less obnoxious his debating points might have carried more weight as it is his references to Auschwitz and Buchenwald seem no more than tasteless attempts to use the tragedy of the Holocaust to justify his own arrogance and ruthlessness.In my view however the film does more than examine the moral complexities of Furtwngler's position. It also explores the moral complexities of the Allied position.

	onyx:emotionText "In 1946 Wilhelm Furtwngler one of Germany's greatest musicians and the conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic was put on trial before a denazification tribunal even though he was a member of neither the German government nor the Wehrmacht. He was not accused of war crimes indeed he was not accused of any crimes in the normal meaning of the term. He was never a member of the Nazi Party made little secret of his dislike for them and always refused to give the Nazi salute. He assisted several Jewish musicians to leave the country. The Allied authorities however were well aware of the symbolic importance of culture especially music in German life and were determined to land a big fish. Furtwngler was charged with supporting Nazism by remaining in Germany performing at Nazi party functions and with making antiSemitic remarks.Furtwngler was eventually cleared of all these charges and allowed to resume his musical career but even so he still remained suspect in many people's eyes. He was not for example allowed to conduct in America after the war. To me this has always seemed unfair given that there were other eminent musicians who were enthusiastic Nazis such as his younger rival Herbert von Karajan who actually joined the Nazi Party in his native Austria in 1933 at a time when that party was looked on with extreme disfavour by the country's authoritarian but antiNazi government. Even Arturo Toscanini hailed as an antiFascist hero after he left Italy in 1931 was himself once a Fascist who in 1919 stood unsuccessfully as one of the party's parliamentary candidates.Istvan Szabo also directed Mephisto another film about an artist in that case an actor who compromises with the Nazis in order to continue working in Germany. The theme may have some personal relevance for Szabo himself as he worked in Hungary under the Communist regime. Taking Sides based upon Ronald Harwood's stage play imagines Furtwngler's pretrial interrogation by Major Steve Arnold an American officer. Most of the film takes place in Arnold's office an appropriately claustrophobic setting which perhaps betrays its origins in the theatre although we also see shots of the ruins of Berlin outside. There is one very effective scene of a classical concert taking place in a ruined church.Arnold is in many ways unsuitable for the task to which he has been assigned. He is a philistine ignorant of classical music. He refers to Furtwngler as a bandleader and when asked which is his favourite Beethoven symphony replies the eleventh. Upon being told that Beethoven only wrote nine he claims unconvincingly to have been joking. In civilian life he was an insurance investigator and he has some similarities to the cynical character played by Edward G Robinson in Double Indemnity who automatically suspects all insurance claims of being fraudulent. That film is briefly mentioned here. Arnold takes a strong dislike to Furtwngler whom he suspects of being a fraud and a hypocrite and bullies him mercilessly.Furtwngler however does have three surprising allies all of whom have perhaps more cause to hate the Nazis than Arnold does Arnold's Russian counterpart Colonel Dymshitz his young assistant Corporal David Wills ne Weill a German Jew forced to flee to the US from the Nazis and his German secretary Emmi whose father was executed for his part in the plot to overthrow Hitler. Dymshitz unlike Arnold is a music lover although he has seen his homeland devastated by the Nazi invasion he has lived under Stalin and therefore understands the compromises that need to be made with a totalitarian regime. Wills and Emmi take objection to Arnold's bullying of Furtwngler which remind them of Gestapo interrogation tactics.There are two excellent performances in the leading roles. Stellan Skarsgard's Furtwngler is a saddened disillusioned man who has realised too late the evil of which his political masters were capable. Yet he defends his decision to remain in Germany as a champion of the humane enlightened values of high culture at a time when those values were under attack like never before to continue playing the music of Beethoven Mozart and Schubert at a time when the German people most sorely needed to hear it.Harvey Keitel's Arnold is a classic example of the little man given too much power. Perhaps this type was best described by Shakespeare in Measure for Measure the man dressed in a little brief authority who like an angry ape plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven as make the angels weep. Some have complained that Harwood Szabo and Keitel load the dice in Furtwngler's favour by making Arnold too unpleasant. Had he been less obnoxious his debating points might have carried more weight as it is his references to Auschwitz and Buchenwald seem no more than tasteless attempts to use the tragedy of the Holocaust to justify his own arrogance and ruthlessness.In my view however the film does more than examine the moral complexities of Furtwngler's position. It also explores the moral complexities of the Allied position. The ruins of Berlin remind us of the ruins of other German and Japanese cities such as Dresden and Hiroshima and of the fact that not all wartime acts of brutality were committed by one side. Even those who serve democratic governments can abuse their authority the denazification tribunals in which the defendants had committed no crime but were accused of guilt by association with others and required to prove their innocence can today be seen as a dressrehearsal for McCarthyism. Although the film was made before the outbreak of the Iraq War some may also see parallels with Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay. A firstclass film which asks some troubling questions. 810";

Perhaps the film is correct in implying that Furtwangler did collaborate with the Nazis and unfortunately could not keep the realms of music and politics separate as he would have wished. Perhaps criticizing him for not leaving Germany was unfair. I compare Furtwangler to Richard Wagner. Wagner wrote the most incredibly beautiful music which became the theme music of the Third Reich and was himself a virulent antiSemite.

Harvey Keitel plays an American officer in postWorldWarTwo Germany who is given the job of dealing with Wilhelm Furtwangler perhaps the best classical music conductor in the world. The question is can Furtwangler be associated with the crimes of Nazism? Harvey Keitel and Stellan Skarsgaard give equally riveting performances but Skarsgaard stands out because he depicts a type that films don't often focus on a man so dedicated to his high art that he comes across as an extraterrestial when confronted with concrete concerns. His performance was certainly Oscar worthy.In a scene as heartwrenching as any I've seen in any film Furtwangler attempts to present his carefully prepared philosophy of art. To say that he is rudely interrupted is an understatement. I cried for him and for humanity.Keitel depicts a driven man who wants justice but who arrived too late to exact it. Nazism's victims are already dead. He can't save them. And so he embarks on a Quixotic quest to bring down a man whose relationship to Nazism is questionable.Keitel's character wants desperately for the world to be painted in black and white with heroes on one side and devils  a word he uses  on the other. At a key moment his secretary whose WW II family history is pertinent makes a key disclosure that might have served to widen and deepen his view of the world. But this is a man who does not want a wider or deeper view of the world. He wants justice something others might call revenge.Moritz Bleibtreu Birgit Minichmayr and Ulrich Tukur are poignant heart breaking and thought provoking in smaller roles.Kudos to Ronald Harwood for his merciless script.

Sure we all would like to think we would stand up but faced with the reality would we? We only have to see how propaganda in unjust wars in many countries have shown the populace to follow the sheep mentality because it's not only easy but none of us really want to accept that our country could be embarking on the road of evil.Secondly the way Keitel conducts his interviews surely mirrors the regime that the allied forces have just replaced. When Keitel is given his brief from his commander he is told to find a certain outcome before he has even read the notes on his target to shut up the 'Washington liberals'  but isn't liberalism the very thing that had been missing from Germany under the Nazi regime? Keitel constantly compares legitimate insurance practises with the Nazi style of administration. The conductor asks Keitel why another conductor who was a Nazi Party member was already allowed to work again when he was not and Keitel dismissed his question by simply saying 'but that's not your case'. A chilling example of how much of the modern world works.This film was a warning that we should be very careful not to become that which we loathe when we have the opportunity to change for the better.".

A chilling example of how much of the modern world works.This film was a warning that we should be very careful not to become that which we loathe when we have the opportunity to change for the better.";

Who of us though would have known when or if  to leave our home country?  Easy to judge from outside. Doeas his saving of some a few Jews make up for playing for Hitler and compromising his principles throughout the war?  See the movie and listen to the case for both sides.

I believe that Istvan Sabo made a truly well developed theater piece screened for all times. Harvey's and Stellan's monologues are just cream on the whole post war cake served whatever taste is. What really went beyond control if you ask me is American feature film voice and picture of God judge and jury represented so well by Harvey Keitel.

I guess everybody has to play their roles. Citizens of the country whose ancestors exterminated over 80 million native Americans just to get their land is judging Nazi Germany for exterminating 6 million Jews that were left to die until the interest didn't move their troops to Europe. Officer of the country that killed over 6 million civilians only in Vietnam and Korean war together talks about responsibility of an artist? What about the responsibility of John Wayne glorified figure of the greatest civilian massacre in human history? What about Barry Sadler and Merle Haggard the hippie hater whose music was encouraging US boys to throw napalm over Vietnamese women and children? Is napalm better than gas chambers of the Nazis? And what about Birth of Nation and D.W. Griffith? Isn't he the one of the greatest establishers of American feature film? D.W. Griffith the clan's man ... Well examples are many many of them probably worse than the poor attempt to make a plot for this film as nobody ever trialled these people and on contrary  they have been glorified until today.

It is an interesting period to be talking about particularly when it deals with such a delicate matter as the inquisitions of the people that were suspects of having been members of the Nazi Party. America on one side the nation that wants to capture all the Nazis and Russia that wants to keep the talented ones. In other words the country of Germany stunned by what had been the Nazi period stunned by whatever they had been kept obscure of being screwed from both sides.Here is a film where you can't take sides because the filmmaker takes it for you. Szabo makes it very clear that Dr. Furtwangler is not evil. In fact this is what we think in Music Box by CostaGarvas which is why until the end we must wonder whether Szabo is playing us fooling us in actually believing in the kindness of strangers. And on the other side of the good side is the Harvey Keitel side who makes no gimmicks of the fact that he is playing on the evil tough side.The outcome is not goofy it's cheesy. Us being told that we are wrong. Us being told by European filmmakers that Americans were bold. Of course that is probably true. Perhaps Furtwangler wasn't a buddy of Hitler's. But were the Americans wrong in seeking revenge. under such a dubious and biased ligght we cannot take sides when we are not given an opportunity to take sides. Keitel's Maj. Arnold hates the Nazis not because of what they did but because he is brainwashed. And if that wasn't enough to prove his instability we get his shakiness when he catches his two associates out on a date and he is angry at the fact that the woman didn't pick him.The film plays out more like a stage play than a film. In fact the film is based on a stage play. That wouldn't even be so bad because Skarsgard is really good at playing the guy we must pity and Keitel is really good as playing the guy we must hate. It's all set out for us. The sides have been picked we have been cheated. This is another film where the filmmaker manipulates our thoughts which wouldn't even be so bad. But when the film drags on and is sucked dry of inventiveness as this one it shouldn't be forgiven. In fact the only parts where the film flows are the interrogatory scenes that display Maj. Arnold's rude and aggressive methods that are good at drawing out attention. And Skarsgard is good as the helpless victim.The photography is not perfect strange because he decides not to move the camera itself so much and yet he doesn't take his time to think through the miseenscene. I suppose however that you could be doing worse counting that there is no character in the play that is particularly sexually appealing which is ever so important on the silver screen.WATCH FOR THE MOMENT  When after the second time Skargard's character gets up off his seat. He is angry scared defeated. He has no chance is succeeding. That is a brilliant performance. Too bad it's an easy performance for the rest of the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's probably an exaggeration to describe Audition as extreme its mixture of gore and realism is nowhere near as bad as in say Irrerversible or A Hole In My Heart but that shouldn't sidetrack from what is ultimately a very challenging and unorthodox film. While the idea of a film changing genres midstream is nothing new or radical in itself From Dusk Till Dawn is a good example the way in which Audition suddenly hits you with its own surrealistic brand of Freudian horror is wholly untypical because the change in genre is not just a gimmick likein aforementioned Dusk Till Dawn but is used to directly comment on whatever has preceded it during the storyline.One thing which struck me about Audition is how complete and accomplished it all seems. I say this because most of Takashi Miike's work including films I sincerely enjoyed like Ichi The Killer or Dead Or Alive does appear a bit rushed at times. No doubt this is in part due to Miike's notoriously insane work rate  an average of three films a year  but it makes Audition all the more remarkable. This is in no way meant to downplay Miike's other work it's simply to emphasise the strengths on display with Audition nighflawless acting stunning cinematography a very intelligently and thoughtfully constructed narrative and some of the most memorable albeit disturbing imagery I've ever seen on film.To regard the final third of Audition as a feminist revenge fantasy is true to a degree but I think it's also to oversimplify the more cerebral aspects of the narrative. Graham White made some excellent points in his review of the film here and it's difficult to add anything of substance but I personally interpreted the final third as a physical illustration of the mixture of guilt and fear Aoyama feels towards both his old and new wife guilt at his late wife for remarrying and at Asami for holding a fake audition and furthermore lying to all women involved during the audition a point where Aoyama himself says he feels like some sort of criminal. In any case people who take this film at face value are missing the point because the final third is an extended metaphor even if the myriad of different interpretations we can arrive at illustrates how richly textured the narrative is.Unfortunately the film's ingenuity is often ignored due to its violent content and as a consequence Audition is stuck in a double bind of sorts too violent for serious movie goers and too intellectually challenging for gore fans. This is probably a gross generalisation of its audience but the fact that people constantly bicker about its boring start and it's violent ending while very little attention is paid to the thematic elements of the narrative seems to suggest that this film has largely been misinterpreted in what it actually set out to achieve. Audition does not simply aim to comment on the state of relationships between men and women it also aims to challenge our perception of film genre by playing around with conventions to such an effect that it deliberately shocks and destabilises its audience. Ultimately this is what makes Audition such a challenging movie. We as an audience have become so accustomed to the lazy generic categorisations of movies that when we see a love story we want a romance and when we see horror we want gore. Finding the two mixed up challenges our expectations and demystifies the notion that everything about a film can be summarised by the one genre it's meant to fit into. I hate using the word postmodern but this is what ultimately what this film is since it's very conscious of the conventions it plays with. Furthermore this is not simply a case of romance mixing with horror but also with realism mixing with extended metaphors and the latter eventually taking over the narrative completely  it's very rare that this sort of thing happens in film but needless to say it only adds to the clever originality on display here.If a mainstream audience is willing to dismiss a film as radical and wonderfully uncompromising as this simply because it does not meet their narrow expectations of what films are meant to be and if they are unwilling to embrace a different kind of film making and widen their scope then I expect the fault not to rest with the film itself but with the audience that has rejected it. I for one am glad to have seen it".

Stories not about ghosts but about the simplest of acts are being told with horrific overtones and this is one of the best.Real horror is not about the actual confrontation between the heroheroine and the monster in the attic but about the anticipation leading to that encounter where we see an impending sense of wrongness of something terrible lurking just around the corner that may have an equally horrible gift in tow. Takashi Miike the true star and ringleader of this disturbing foray into terror brings us a deceptively simple setup about a TV producer Aoyama Ryo Ishibashi who is looking for a bride by the use of an ruse an audition for a film. It all has the lighthearted tone of a romantic comedy of manners depicting sexual attitudes in a totally different culture. Once he settles for a shy girl dressed in complete virginal white Asami Eihi Shiina the stage is set for their subsequent meetings as he is drawn closer to her allure despite the fact that her resume has some seemingly glaring holes  people she's been associated with have gone missing. When Aoyama decides to call Asami we're introduced to the most disturbing scene in the movie her empty apartment her figure seen sitting by the phone and a large canvas bag seen near the background. Once the phone rings the canvas bag suddenly jerks Asami coldly smiles a scene that totally switches the romantic tone of the film and makes a screaming left turn into what can only be considered a surrealistic nightmare or a bad acid trip that is devoid of true resolution  by Miike's own words. And by doing so ODISHON becomes Asami's story her reenaction of a trauma inflicted on her by a sick older man with Aoyama as her newest victim.This is definitely a powerful film with layers of subtext and a study on how to create a convincing horror story in which we are the monsters and agents of our own entrapments and that even monsters who reenact their crucial split with reality were themselves once battered children. Of course I would not recommend this as a movie to watch if one is getting to know their date. There is something revolting of not knowing the reason that a flapping disembodied tongue just happens to be in front of the front door of your date's apartment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Arthouse horror flicks are not a very common genre few come to mind except 'Don't Look Now' but Takashi Miike's film 'Audition' is a welcome addition to the canon.  Beautifully shot and orchestrated it is both a subtle personal drama and one of the most genuinely horrifying things I have seen. The early stages of this film resemble a work by Claude Sautet only seen through a Japanese sensibility about the relationship between an older man and a beautiful young woman but there's something slightly discomforting both in the man's definition of the perfect partner and in the person he finds who fulfills it. The story slides into first a mystery and then a full blown horror story the power of which comes from following a very simple golden rule namely make the audience care about the characters first one small needle can be very very scary if you think that it's for real. And by keeping the meaning ambiguous unlike say 'The Shining' with its selfdefeating collapse into hyperbolic mania the film also retains its impact after the initial shock.This sense of ambiguity is also crucial to the film's claims to be something more than simply an unorthodox gorefest.  'Audition' constructs and then deconstructs a certain vision of the world and the horror scenes are only part of this.  The result is utterly beguiling  and one can even see similarities with Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' in 'Audition's' portrayal of a man's complicit relationship with hell.In some ways this is not a universal film and I could not imagine it working in English can you envisage any Western actress speaking the Eihi Shiina's lines with a straight face?.  Whether that's because the film is saying something profound about Japanese culture  or whether the fact that it appears to do so can finesse the issue for foreign audiences I'm not sure.  Dramatically 'Audition' is despite its climax not the best film ever made.  But atmospherically speaking it's a masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are about 15 minutes of Audition that everyone remembers and talks about and about 95 minutes of movie that you'd think didn't even exist if you listened to others' comments. But this is the director's fault when you set out to shock your audience as much as Takashi Miike does in this film you can't blame the audience if all they remember about your film is the shocking part.Which is a shame because Audition is quite a bit more than a mere horror movie. It's really more of a feverish psychological drama along the lines of a David Lynch film. In fact in structure and tone this film reminded me of Lynch's Mulholland Drive and if Lynch didn't have his own unique style and brand of filmmaking I might wonder if he was inspired in part by this film when he made his own.What other comments here have done nicely is summarize what Audition is about. A man Shigeharu Aoyama mourning the loss of his wife looks to find the perfect woman to replace her and he holds bogus auditions for an ostensible film role in order to find her. But the girl who catches his interest Asami Yamazaki turns out to be a much better actress than he bargained for. What other comments DON'T necessarily convey however is how much of this film takes place in the world of dreams and how blurred the line between reality and fantasy is. This dilutes the violence of the film's final moments because there is a strong suggestion that this violence is taking place in the protagonist's nightmares.Is Audition a critique of the confined roles women are forced to inhabit in Japanese society? Is it about Aoyama's guilt in feeling the need for a woman to replace his dead wife? Is it about his fear of finding a girl that actually can replace her thereby diminishing what he had with her? Is the film about the extent to which all relationships are auditions where each person involved makes himherself vulnerable and exposes himherself to acceptance or rejection at the whims of another? A case can be made for its being about all of these things.When the violence comes at the end it's not as graphic as the hype would lead you to believe. Even so I wish Miike hadn't pushed the envelope quite so far. One has to wonder if the emotional impact of the film would have been any less just because the violence was less graphic and I suspect the answer to that is no. The violence feels gratuitous and cheapens slightly everything that comes before it. It mars the film but fortunately it doesn't ruin it.This is far more of a thinking man's film that its reputation would lead you to believe. Those who come to it for the titillating shock of its gore are bound to be disappointed.Grade B".

	schema:headline " Freud would have a fieldday";
	schema:reviewBody "I will not go over plot points already covered in other reviews but rather add another dimension to the discussion of the horror  gore aspect of the movie.  Essentially I agree with the points point forward by the reviewer 'tedg' from Virginia Beach.In my view the horrific and gory scenes of Aoyama being drugged dismembered and so on are all dreamt.  That is everything between Aoyama being covered with a sheet after entering the bed with Asami and his waking up to fetch a glass of water is a dream.  The dream continues after he goes back to bed.To put it simply at the surface level the movie is a psychologically acute and well acted drama about the growing relationship between Asami and Aoyama.  Now just as vintage horror fans will tell you that which is implied is far more subtly terrifying than simple splatter and gore.  The torture and punishment Aoyama undergoes at the hands of Asami is a nightmare firmly rooted in the narrative of the socalled boring buildup to these gutwrenching scenes.An attentive look at the first three quarters of the movie reveals how motifs phrases and the emotional 'baggage' brought by each protagonist to the relationship are reworked in Aoyama's subconscious into a terrifying nightmare.It is to the writer's credit that this nightmare follows dreamlogic in a way that is still cinematic and accessible.  It is a dream which reveals much about the character of Aoyama and nothing at all about Asami.  In fact through the whole film she is more an object of his gaze and interpretation than a subject narrating her own experience.Does this mean that this movie should not be classified as a horror film? In my view it is better seen any only makes sense at the level of an insightful character driven drama about the guiltcomplex of a traditional middleaged man decided upon marrying a younger woman with some baggage of her own.  Her 'baggage' is of course only alluded to but it is enough for Aoyama's imagination to work into a powerful expression of his own fears and sense of guilt.  And likeable as the character of Aoyama is there is enough for his guilt to chew on he has used the an artificial and deceptive 'audition' to find himself a wife.  He was against the idea but talked into it by his coworker.  Is it so strange that his subconscious should reproach him for it?  He is remarrying after the death of his first wife through illness.  Is it so strange that she should reappear in the dream sequence to warn him against Asami?  And Asami herself is somewhat of a mysterious character.  She is marrying a far older man.  Why? And why isn't she already involved with someone.  She has had a difficult upbringing.  What emotional scars might it have left on her?  The character herself so brilliantly acted also conveys a negative 'vibe' in the way some people just seem to do.This is a movie in which the 'male' gaze is very much the primary one. The story is told from his point of view.  But the female has her own revenge. She intrudes through the workings of his subconscious complicated by his doubts and his repressed sense of guilt.  If she must be objectified in the manner she is an unattached female drawn out of a shortlist of viable female candidates and turned into a dutiful wife then she might just become potentially a rather nasty object.  In the strange reverse world of the dream she has become the active subject and he is the drugged and immobile victim of her tortures and punishments.        .Why then is the movie always referred to as a horror film?  In short it needed to be promoted as such to get an audience.  If the reviews here are anything to go by it certainly seems to have been received as such.But it is so much more than a horror flick oneandahalf hours more in fact.  It is NOT a horror film with good characterization but an insightful romantic drama with a violent undertone of personal and cultural repression. In fact I would say that it is unique in standing between the two genres linking the two and transgressing the bounds of both for if horror films are so often characterless splatterfests then romantic dramas are also often guilty of being superficial sugary twaddle.  To see it any other way is to overlook what the film achieves at once so brilliantly and so terrifyingly.  Whether this was a fluke or intended as such can only be answered by the director himself.  I like to think that like Asami this movie can take on a life of its own in the viewer's mind.".

	onyx:emotionText "I will not go over plot points already covered in other reviews but rather add another dimension to the discussion of the horror  gore aspect of the movie.  Essentially I agree with the points point forward by the reviewer 'tedg' from Virginia Beach.In my view the horrific and gory scenes of Aoyama being drugged dismembered and so on are all dreamt.  That is everything between Aoyama being covered with a sheet after entering the bed with Asami and his waking up to fetch a glass of water is a dream.  The dream continues after he goes back to bed.To put it simply at the surface level the movie is a psychologically acute and well acted drama about the growing relationship between Asami and Aoyama.  Now just as vintage horror fans will tell you that which is implied is far more subtly terrifying than simple splatter and gore.  The torture and punishment Aoyama undergoes at the hands of Asami is a nightmare firmly rooted in the narrative of the socalled boring buildup to these gutwrenching scenes.An attentive look at the first three quarters of the movie reveals how motifs phrases and the emotional 'baggage' brought by each protagonist to the relationship are reworked in Aoyama's subconscious into a terrifying nightmare.It is to the writer's credit that this nightmare follows dreamlogic in a way that is still cinematic and accessible.  It is a dream which reveals much about the character of Aoyama and nothing at all about Asami.  In fact through the whole film she is more an object of his gaze and interpretation than a subject narrating her own experience.Does this mean that this movie should not be classified as a horror film?

	schema:reviewBody "Based on a novel by Ryu Murakami director Takashi Miike's Audition is surprisingly deliberate and straightforward for much of its length. It's not a bad film at all but most of it is in the realm of realist drama even becoming something of a romance at one point. There are a few brutal images and scenarios but they arrive primarily towards the end of the film and they tend to be more conceptually disturbing than graphically violent.Audition is the story of Shigeharu Aoyama Ryo Ishibashi who is living alone with his son Shigehiko Tetsu Sawaki after his wife Ryoko Miyuki Matsuda passes away. First egged on by Shigehiko Shigeharu decides to remarry. He enlists the help of a movie producer friend Yasuhisha Yoshikawa Jun Kunimura who devises a scheme well known to pornographershe sets up bogus auditions for a film.Yasuhisha acquires a large number of resumes and headshots for this purpose out of which he asks Shigehiko to choose 30 women to audition. Before the audition day even arrives Shigehiko has his eyes set on one particular woman Asami Yamazaki Eihi Shiina. Asami strikes Yasuhisha as peculiar but Shigehiko has fallen for her and a romance begins. However Yasuhisha turns out to be rightthere is something strange about her as the audience can clearly see due to the fine performance from Shiina. Audition explores Asami's story and her relationship to Shigehiko.It's a good hour at least before anything very out of the ordinary happens in the film and even when that time does arrive the strange occurrences are extremely subtle at first. The pacing and tone of this first half of the film is more similar to Hideo Nakata's style as displayed in films like Ringu 1998 and Dark Water Honogurai mizu no soko kara 2002. This is only the third Miike film I've seen so far I had difficulty tracking them down for purchase or rental before I joined Netflix and the directorial style of Audition was surprising to me. That's because so far every Miike film I've seen has a completely different style the other two I've watched to date are Ichi the Killer Koroshiya 1 and Happiness of the Katakuris Katakurike no kfuku both from 2001.But as a realist drama that ventures into romance and slight mysterythriller territory during its first half Audition is a fine piece of artyou just have to know what to expect. All of Miike's films that I've seen so faras different as they are stylisticallyshare excellent direction. Miike is extremely adept at handling his cast he knows how to get incredible cinematography and he has interestingly varied ways of blocking scenes. Audition has a combination of a voyeur and a psychologically dissociative theme in its cinematography appropriate to the plot. We view quite a few scenes from a distancethe camera is sometimes even placed in a room adjacent to the main action there is a great handheld tracking shot following Shigeharu and Yasuhisha through their office from behind partitions ala James Whale's Frankenstein 1931 an important repeated scene in a restaurant that gives us another psychological angle with significantly altered dialogue is shot at a distance in the dnouement another repeated dialogue scene with shifted meaning is shot from another room and so on.Of course the main attraction for most folks at least in my part of the world is the more mysterious and visceral material that enters in the second half as the majority of Miike fans tend to be horror fans. For awhile Miike Murakami and scriptwriter Daisuke Tengan whom Miike amusingly says must have been on drugs when he wrote Audition because the script was so weirdhe implies that he tried to normalize it a bit play with audience expectations as Audition threatens to become a more standard relationship thriller then a ghost story then a rubber reality film all of these things are implied in turn during one of the best extended sequences of the film and finally we realize that it's more about a psychotic villain. This final revelation leads to the infamous climactic scenes of the film which will test some audience members' constitutions as we venture into more grisly territory accompanied by marvelous hallucinatory sequences. The performances in this section are worthy of a 10 even if as Miike says in his commentary Shiina at least seemed to almost stop performing and simply became the charactera frightening thought particularly for Ishibashi.There are a number of subtexts that one can read into Audition although Miike characteristically for Asian genre cinema stresses an intention of ambiguity. Many read the film as kind of a twisted feminist empowerment fantasy. After all even if Shigeharu did not have the womanizing history and ill intentions for the audition that some characters believe him to have had those beliefs are in line with at least a cynical misogynistic account of the typical motivations. Shigehiko's girlfriend who makes a brief appearance is presented as a counterexample to be surmounted on this reading as she is a traditional token of a more yielding female. Shigeharu's coworker who says she is going to get married is presented as a more implicitly abused counterexample.But the film works on many other levels too no less a very literal one. Although I only thought Audition was a B the letter grade equivalent to my 8 this time around I can easily see my score improving on future viewings when I have more appropriate expectations. If you are a fan of Hideo Nakata's films or even Byeongki Ahn's Phone 2002 which is very similar in tone you shouldn't miss Audition.".

Audition is a truly strange and unique film. Miiki almost effortlessly seems to combine ambiances and elements that you always considered impossible to combine. At several moments during the first hour of the film when the relationship between the two lead characters laboriously develops you really wonder yourself how such a sober and melodramatic love story could possibly transgress into a reputedly shocking horror film but it does!

I definitely also wouldn't advise this film if you already have a phobia for needles.

He could also clearly rely on highly skilled and professional cinematographers editors and production designers. The music is stupendous and the performances of both lead actor Ryo Ishibashi and Eihi Shiina are damn near perfect.

	schema:reviewBody " Spoileresque  It's difficult to know what my reaction to this film is. I have several they're strong and they're pulling me in different directions. Let me explain. This film sets off at a gentle pace. A bereaved husband and father sets out to look for a new wife when his son says he's looking lost. A friend of his in the film industry sets up an 'audition' superficially trying to discover an unknown actress but actually trying to find him the young trained traditional Japanese wife he would like. Just like his previous partner and not at all like those awful young loud girls in bars. He falls for one an exballet dancer forced to give up dancing because of a dodgy hip. But his producer friends thinks something's amiss and he's not wrong...And so the film goes by. The director has said he set out to bore the audience for the first two thirds of the film. The producer in the audition asks one candidate if she has 'seen any films by Tarkovsky'. I'm assuming this is an aside to the audience saying 'yes this is deliberately slow please gently fall asleep in your seats get used to it'. I determined to be stubborn enjoyed it. It sets up the characters well especially the lead. A damaged soul still hurting from the loss. Cajoled into looking to fill that gap by those around him he cheers up. He fishes for her hoping for the big catch. He looks like getting lucky. He dares to have hopes. A new life beckons and slowly builds. I didn't really think it was that slow or boring. But then I like Tarkovsky.The purpose of this alleged boredom of course is that it all ends up with acupuncture nightmares missing persons child abuse and discarded digits all in graphic technicolour terror vision. If you didn't know it was coming you would have ended up with your popcorn all over the person in front of you including the popcorn you were contentedly digesting.It would be easy to read this film as a misandristgynophobic horror. It might be taken as a more specifically culturally Japanese lament for the passing of a way of life a la 'Tokyo Story'. You could note that the jumbled chronology or hallucinatory structure of the horror segment could indicate uncertainty. Did it really happen or are those his fears? You could note that it's his son that kills Asami the traditional albeit psychotic being destroyed by the newer generation. You might think that Asami is a Nemesis born from the violent suppression of women through time.You could do all of these things however I think it's a cut and shunt job. I like both sections on their own but stick 'em together and it feels like I can still see the tape holding the two sets of spliced film stock together. These themes deserve exploration and I'd love to see the missing two halves to the two parts we've seen. Together it's a dislocated joint in my brain albeit a wellexecuted and compelling one.Imagine the sensation if the loss and hope in the first half could have made it through to be confronted by the psychosis and nightmares of the second. Instead they're misplaced somewhere in the confusion of a drugged glass of whisky and the director's desire to stupefy us into submission. Despite Asami's philosophy of getting at reality through pain I don't think this film was painful enough although I can't think of any part of it I didn't like. My reactions to the film may be contrary but they don't hurt enough. Deeper please.".

As the movie progresses it becomes clear that most of them could be viewed as a dream sequence but the problem is not all.When Aoyama gets in bed with Asumi it can be assumed they do what we'd expect them to do and then falls asleep which would allow him the chance to dream which could encompass the entirety of Asami disappearing without a trace meeting the old stepfather going to the shut down restaurant and the surreal torture sequence save for the brief moment where he 'wakes up' to be back in bed with Asumi and goes to the bathroom.This is fine and works with the exception of the foreshadowing clip of Asumi answering the phone call for the second? date where the slave in a bag rolls across the floor and moans. This is before the dream sequence and there is no reason for Aoyama to be hallucinating or dreaming at this point he is just at work and decides to make a phone call on his way out. Also he doesn't seem the least big perturbed by this vivid hallucination he has as they go on a date anyway. The placement of this scene tells us the slave and Asumi's vile intentions are all real.From there you have to assume that it is Asumi's disappearance the crazy old man the slave in a bag and the torture scene that are all real. The 'waking up' in bed with Asumi is a fantasy. This is supported also by Asumi's body language as she undresses her movements are slow and angered and then she returns to her submissive facade as she faces Aoyama again.At that point all of the happenings between when Aoyama gets drugged and hits the floor are hallucinations that just don't happen mixed with the pieces that Asumi told Aoyama while they were going out on dates. For the most part nothing that Aoyama experiences while falling down drugged is new to him or couldn't be pieced together inside his head at that point. Also Aoyama was drugged so Asumi's little speech after her neck was mangled by her final fall could have been hallucinated as well.For the most part however doesn't include that Aoyama vividly hallucinates the slave in a bag while falling down from being drugged. If the slave in a bag exists then he couldn't possibly hallucinate something he has no experience with to that sort of detail. In this description of the progress of events there is no point where Aoyama is introduced to the slave in a bag nor is there time for him to be.That brings us to a binary choice about what to think of this movie Either Aoyama was hallucinating vividly without any precursor of awful things about Asumi that he didn't believe while in no state to do so which entails that Asumi really is just a tortured girl not a sadistic torturess... Or Aoyama vividly dreams something he doesn't know about that actually does exist. This could be either a super lucky guess or some mental link between Aoyama and Asumi or maybe some good old voodoo. This would entail that Asumi actually is the evil torturess really did cut off one of Aoyama's feet and possibly died when she hit the floor after sailing over that flight of stairs.If anyone can piece together the movie so it doesn't have either of these blatant holes in the plot then I'd be happy to go onto a deeper discussion of the meat of the movie.".

It is in fact closer to the more extreme moments of David Cronenberg and the profoundly disturbing movies of Jorg Buttgereit Shinya Tsukamoto and Gaspar Noe. Directed with great flair by Takashi Miike and based on a novel by the amazing Ryu Murakami 'Almost Transparent Blue' and 'Coin Locker Babies' 'Odishon' wipes the floor with Hollywood's recent output of supposedly confronting movies 'American Psycho' 'Boy's Don't Cry' 'Requiem For A Dream' and bythenumbers serial killer thrillers 'Hannibal' 'Kiss The Girls' 'The Cell'etc.. Forget those safe mediocre bores THIS is the real deal!Miike lulls you into a false sense of security with his leisurely storytelling and quiet character development which makes the pay off of the last part of the movie even more shocking and unexpected. Ryo Ishibashi is well cast as the middle aged businessman stuck in a rut and the beautiful Eihi Shiina is absolutely astonishing as the girl of his dreams who turns out to be not QUITE what he expected. The less you know about 'Odishon' the better. If you enjoy extreme movie making at its best you'll go ga ga over this first rate slice of shock cinema. Simply unforgettable.".

I was revolted I was disturbed I was scared.Why is this movie so much better than anything I've seen? Subtlety. This movie makes good use of silence sound effects and off camera action to SUGGEST instead of SHOW you what's happening. It's much more satisfying to watch a movie with this kind of approach than it is to watch people get stabbed with blood spraying all over the place. This movie follows no classic horror movie rules. It's completely original.It's not without its faults of course. The plot is a little strange and as the movie progresses on it sometimes gets a little hard to follow. Some would also argue that the beginning is too long and too heavy but I think this is a perfect and even needed contrast to the crazy goingson that will unfold.This is a fabulous movie.

That he feels deep guilt about his deception is obvious in his dreamhallucination sequence when his secretary appears bemoaning the fact that he had sex with her one time and never called her again a failed audition?and most importantly in his remembrance of Aoyama's perverse stepfather begging her to Dance for me Dance for me when he really wanted to gain sexual gratification from the act. The guilt he bears from these deceptions men foist upon women makes the torturous punishment he has to bear almost justified. I suppose women could feel that dating in itself is a bogus audition with men saying they have one goal while they clearly have another.

Audition begins like some kind of a love story i guess with a little comedy and it keeps going for 1h and 20 minutes almost .bla.bla .bla a widower bla bla meets a woman through an audition bla bla bla she 's weird bla bla he s in love ...Then suddenly the movie cuts.The man has a stupid dream or not  and after another 10 minutes we see him on the floor and the woman cutting his legs and pinning needles into his stomach and eyes yey! then his son comes home the man has another stupid dream or not  the woman sprays his son with something to which his son is obviously immune very lame stuff and his son kills the woman .the police will come and we made another movie ... People see this movie and think this is a good movie because people like movies that give twists and something to think about but Miike is just overdoing it .every movie the same stuff gore and a twist ...audition didn t even have much gore ...Audition didn t have much of anything .Takashi makes 10 films a year so there is nothing deep to find in a movie like this but if you look deep enough you can see smth psychological in two stupid dogs  also . love the genius who just looks to shock you and make you wonder about a movie which is about nothing . IMDb should stop giving all these Japanese movies high grades just because they re Japanese .Shutter is a superb film by the way and so is Oldboy maybe one missed call deserves its grade but Visitor q gozu total bull...and the cherry of failures Audition are ten times overrated".

The plot buildup was too long and frankly I was getting bored to death with how long the movie was taking. Not once during this film did I find myself remotely afraid or freaked out. Everything was plain and boring. I do not understand how so many people enjoyed this movie. Its awful. I do not suggest that anyone else watch this movie. The only thing horrific about it is how stupid it really is. It made no sense at all. I am even more shocked about how some people were scared of the bag. Why? Its just a bag that moves a couple times in the movie. We all know what is in it. So do we really need to be that afraid. I will never watch this movie again and I highly recommend that no one else watch it either.".

	schema:headline " A very difficult movie to get a handle on";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a difficult film on many levels.Describing the plot is difficult for several reasons. One is that I should not give too much away. Another is that the plot is difficult to get a handle on. By the end of the movie we are not sure what is going on. Like Rashomon and La locataire The Tenant by Roman Polanski I don't believe what the camera is telling me.The gist of the plot is that Shigeharu Aoyama played by Ryo Ishibashi has been a widower for seven years and his son has encouraged him to get a girlfriend. The fortyish Aoyama has no idea how to go about it so he talks to his friend Yasuhisa Yoshikawa Jun Kunimura. Yoshikawa is a film or television producer. They concoct a scheme to call in about thirty young women ostensibly to audition for a role. Among the thirty is Asami Yamazaki Eihi Shiina and Aoyama is quite taken with her. He asks her out and the tale spins into a maelstrom. The movie was directed in 1999 by Takashi Miike based on the screenplay by Daisuke Tengan. The movie is set in Japan and some of my confusion is undoubtedly based on my unfamiliarity with that culture. For example Aoyama is the owner of a successful company and one of the women who works there walks him to the elevator to announce her engagement. Aoyama is surprised she's telling him and congratulates her rather awkwardly. She responds awkwardly and he leaves. In another scene it's clear she has some interest in Aoyama but I never figured it out. Her character and reason for being in the film were never resolved as far as I could tell. I have no idea whether Miike was telling his viewers something or not.Some of the time I was reminded of Freud's concepts but I have no clue whether Freud's ideas are cultural and limited to Europeans or whether they would apply to Japanese people as well. Audition starts out as a straightforward flick about a man who loved his wife she died in his arms in the hospital and he raised his son alone. Aoyama and Yoshikawa have a conversation about loneliness in general and the loneliness of the Japanese in particular. Aoyama is urged by his son and by Yoshikawa to get a girlfriend. Yoshikawa's scheme of auditions for a movie strike Aoyama as dishonest and at one point he describes the plan as criminal. It's my understanding that Aoyama feels guilty for deserting his wife even though she's been dead for seven years. And I believe Aoyama feels uncomfortable with Asami's age of 24 at one point he's referred to as an old fool.The problem is that as we are sucked with Aoyama down the whirlpool we can't tell whether the director is lying to us about what's going on. Is Miike commenting on Japanese mores and culture of submissive women Aoyama calls Asami obedient? Or is the movie about Aoyama's guilt over leaving his wife for the much younger woman? In the end because I think Miike misleads us I'm unable to tell. I think Miike intentionally makes the last third or so of the movie ambiguous so feel free to insert your own meaning into the end.".

Missing them probably gave me more of a dreamlike exposure anyway.My take on this movie is that it reads like an ironic Twilight Zone episode. Man seeks to find wife.  He decides to lie about an audition in order to pick up a pretty girl. He seems to find his ideal in Asami when she comes to audition.  His friends think there is something not right with her but he progresses with seeing her. He finds out that she has had a troubled life and that she may or may not be involved with the murder of a record producer who she gave as a reference.  A bit confusing but I suppose this moves the plot along...I could have sworn when he is investigating Asami's life someone says she was killed grusomely...but I am not sure if that was her or someone else...can you see where I am going here?  It is very hard tounderstand. It might be bad translation.Right when he sees Asami as his ideal the magic happens.  He is brought into Asami's world. A world of violence child abuse torture dark rooms and cheese wire. One doesn't know where this dream world stops and ends...images of a man in a bag a ballet teacher being killed Asami as a child and perhaps other women from the man's life flash before his eyes. That is before the pins go in...Audition is a modern morality tale. Asami's character has seen the dark side of life and now in death methinks...but she could be really living...the idea she constantly wears white makes me feel like she is a ghost she has to relive this pain by afflicting it on others. Why? Well because it is irony. The man has lied to try to get a girl and this girl in my opinion has been murdering men who hold auditions only as a casting couch ploy to get girls to sleep with them. Asami doesn't know the main character is a good guy...she can only see the anger and hate she has for such men like her ballet teacher who molested her...this is explained symbolically... and the record producer who broke her heart and probably others who aren't talked about...by the way she speaks there has been a line of them.  The punchline is that the good girl dressed in white is the evil sadist but also a victim of society and the pain of being a woman. Sadly this pain is given to a man who could have loved her. But pain is her language of love. It is her truth the only thing she has. It is now her job to do this to make a point. She isn't psycho by any means...it is her pleasant and shy nature her sanity that makes her torture that more hard to take.I did enjoy that after she cut off one of his feet she threw it against the wall for effect. I mean you shouldn't let a good prop go to waste!The whole movie is cautionary.  Be honest with women or you may get pins deeper deeper in your flesh.  I wouldn't say it is a Fatal Attraction...for one it was a lot more interesting than that film.  That film also had a living wife and kids etc...I don't think it is the same at all...the dreamlike imagery does have a Lynchesque appeal...but I wouldn't go there either...just watch it like it is a dream don't compare it to anything and you shall be fine...for now...What can I say about what was dream and what was real? Maybe all of it was a dream? Or maybe as he is getting tortured it is the man's reflections on his own life...with Asami's life drawn in as she is talking to him and he is going under?  It could be completely symbolic with the bag being control fingers being sex feet being power the tongue being a liar...etc...make your own story...The movie ends without Asami actually being dead...her neck moves in almost a supernatural way more ideas of her being a ghost.

	schema:headline " A lonely widowed man takes his friends advice and agrees to a 'fake' audition to screen for his new wife. Nothing is what is seems.";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie cannot necessarily be categorized as horror in the same vein as Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street I was recommended The Audition as if it were a horror. So at first I was a bit expecting crazed Japanese women running around with steak knives but this is NOT that kind of a film. This is a suspensethriller that is more akin with the nonlinear styles of Tarantino's movies and the same genre as Fatal Attraction and Sleeping with the Enemy.What I really loved about this movie was the carefree innocent sort of way our main character Aoyama behaves. The movie starts off a bit slow paced but the second half of this movie gets darker and darker and the finale is well done. When compared to other femme thrillers like Basic Instinct and Fatal Attraction that the U.S. has made The Audition stands firmly in the lead for this particular style lovebetrayalobsession suspense style.Miike's visual style is varied but fits so well into this movie you forget about looking at camera angles and performances and at least in my case I was carried and mesmerized by the movies.Some may find this movie gruesome it is not gory in the ridiculous 'B' movie blood every way however I found some of the scenes a bit disturbing and painful. It was very easy to sympathize with Aoyama and I thought he was very easy to relate to. Do not over hype yourself for the Audition or any movie really tell yourself this is going to be some dumb boring movie and just relax after watching this movie you will have a lot to talk about.SPOILER Please do not read this unless you have seen the movie. After reading the message boards there are various comments about the movie that I noticed some people did not understand. Also many people seem to misinterpret style and atmosphere as something that is completely unnecessary in a horror movie only thing people want to see in a horror flick is body parts blood and violence with a thin veil of a plot. If that's all you want this is not your movie my friend.The first half of the movie is what Aoyama really saw his loneliness which quickly turns into his hope as he reads Asami's resume. He falls for her without seeing her in other words he sees what he wants to see and nothing else. He dismisses all other potential wife candidates and had pretty much settled on Asami his interview with her reveals he already had fallen in love with the vision of his perfect replacement wife.The conversations he has with Asami are real he ignores all warnings and again he sees only what he wants you to see and in reflection of that the entire first half of the movie plays out like a calm romance melodrama. Certain things make Aoyama suspicious she never gets dropped off at home and he doesn't go to her place. Finally she suddenly leaves him in the hotel Aoyama's loneliness and distraught returns full force and he has to find out what happened to Asami so he tracks down her old dance school and meets what you learn later is her STEPFATHER.He then comes across a bar she used to work at called the Stone Fish a bar owned by Asami's AUNT I suspect that the man who often came to the bar was her UNCLE but it's not certain and it could be that the UNCLE is the RECORD COMPANY AGENT although it's not certain. What is implied is that UNCLE or RECORD COMPANY AGENT told Asami that they loved her. Aoyama gets a shocking glimpse into her life meeting her STEPFATHER and more disturbing information from the man who gives a brief history of the Stone Fish.The final act of this movie is really the revelation Asami breaks into Aoyama's house and poison's his drink with a paralyzing drug. As he falls Aoyama has a surrealistic readNOT LITERAL BUT BASED ON REALITY dream in which he puts it all together. You see the OTHER SIDE of the conversations he has with Asami the disturbing side Aoyama ignores about Asami. Her abuse and her attitude don't fit he then foresees the result of the Stepfather getting his head sawed off. Her torture and screwed up childhood. What happened to her UNCLE or RECORD COMPANY AGENT you never see his face yet he knows he is living in that house as her pet Love only me is Asami's neurotic thought. She killed her AUNT by sawing her to pieces and leaving RECORD AGENT or UNCLE's 3 digits and a tongue at the scene. The reason I think the RECORD AGENT is the UNCLE is because she says the UNCLE was real bad to her and SO WAS HER AUNT. So the scene at the Stone Fish makes more sense if it's revenge against both. In which the UNCLE who probably molested her is now her slave.In the end Aoyama understands that he will share this fate You will love only me she throws this lie he agreed to in his face when she brings up the fact he will always love his son not ONLY HER. She kills his dog another love and make it perfectly clear his son will die and that he will be mutilated and tortured and be her pet forever.Aoyama's 2nd dream is very different from the first that was short and sweet and was simply what Aoyama wished for or wished wasn't happening. He went back to a time when he was happy with Asami had his feet and she tells him she loves him back. That's all he wanted to hear.".

This is a suspensethriller that is more akin with the nonlinear styles of Tarantino's movies and the same genre as Fatal Attraction and Sleeping with the Enemy.What I really loved about this movie was the carefree innocent sort of way our main character Aoyama behaves. The movie starts off a bit slow paced but the second half of this movie gets darker and darker and the finale is well done. When compared to other femme thrillers like Basic Instinct and Fatal Attraction that the U.S. has made The Audition stands firmly in the lead for this particular style lovebetrayalobsession suspense style.Miike's visual style is varied but fits so well into this movie you forget about looking at camera angles and performances and at least in my case I was carried and mesmerized by the movies.Some may find this movie gruesome it is not gory in the ridiculous 'B' movie blood every way however I found some of the scenes a bit disturbing and painful. It was very easy to sympathize with Aoyama and I thought he was very easy to relate to. Do not over hype yourself for the Audition or any movie really tell yourself this is going to be some dumb boring movie and just relax after watching this movie you will have a lot to talk about.SPOILER Please do not read this unless you have seen the movie. After reading the message boards there are various comments about the movie that I noticed some people did not understand. Also many people seem to misinterpret style and atmosphere as something that is completely unnecessary in a horror movie only thing people want to see in a horror flick is body parts blood and violence with a thin veil of a plot. If that's all you want this is not your movie my friend.The first half of the movie is what Aoyama really saw his loneliness which quickly turns into his hope as he reads Asami's resume. He falls for her without seeing her in other words he sees what he wants to see and nothing else. He dismisses all other potential wife candidates and had pretty much settled on Asami his interview with her reveals he already had fallen in love with the vision of his perfect replacement wife.The conversations he has with Asami are real he ignores all warnings and again he sees only what he wants you to see and in reflection of that the entire first half of the movie plays out like a calm romance melodrama. Certain things make Aoyama suspicious she never gets dropped off at home and he doesn't go to her place. Finally she suddenly leaves him in the hotel Aoyama's loneliness and distraught returns full force and he has to find out what happened to Asami so he tracks down her old dance school and meets what you learn later is her STEPFATHER.He then comes across a bar she used to work at called the Stone Fish a bar owned by Asami's AUNT I suspect that the man who often came to the bar was her UNCLE but it's not certain and it could be that the UNCLE is the RECORD COMPANY AGENT although it's not certain. What is implied is that UNCLE or RECORD COMPANY AGENT told Asami that they loved her. Aoyama gets a shocking glimpse into her life meeting her STEPFATHER and more disturbing information from the man who gives a brief history of the Stone Fish.The final act of this movie is really the revelation Asami breaks into Aoyama's house and poison's his drink with a paralyzing drug. As he falls Aoyama has a surrealistic readNOT LITERAL BUT BASED ON REALITY dream in which he puts it all together. You see the OTHER SIDE of the conversations he has with Asami the disturbing side Aoyama ignores about Asami. Her abuse and her attitude don't fit he then foresees the result of the Stepfather getting his head sawed off. Her torture and screwed up childhood. What happened to her UNCLE or RECORD COMPANY AGENT you never see his face yet he knows he is living in that house as her pet Love only me is Asami's neurotic thought. She killed her AUNT by sawing her to pieces and leaving RECORD AGENT or UNCLE's 3 digits and a tongue at the scene. The reason I think the RECORD AGENT is the UNCLE is because she says the UNCLE was real bad to her and SO WAS HER AUNT. So the scene at the Stone Fish makes more sense if it's revenge against both. In which the UNCLE who probably molested her is now her slave.In the end Aoyama understands that he will share this fate You will love only me she throws this lie he agreed to in his face when she brings up the fact he will always love his son not ONLY HER. She kills his dog another love and make it perfectly clear his son will die and that he will be mutilated and tortured and be her pet forever.Aoyama's 2nd dream is very different from the first that was short and sweet and was simply what Aoyama wished for or wished wasn't happening. He went back to a time when he was happy with Asami had his feet and she tells him she loves him back. That's all he wanted to hear.";

You can't compare this one and bring it up to the same level as the Guinea Pigs Films or the other dark underground movies.However what this movie did gave the viewer was fully sympathy for actually two characters one is of course Shigehiko Aoyama the son and the woman at Shigeharu Aoyama's office who was about to married... and here's where i lost the story.First of all who is she? Why does she even mentions her marriage and why does she acting like she does? And why did her role dropped out when you had PLENTY of time in the movie to get us know a bit more about her. The second one is Shigehiko Aoyama. He shows up some few times in the movie and one time with his new friend but that's it. And one heroentrance in the end of the movie. I'd love to know more about his life as well instead of watching minutes long scenes on various restaurants.This is a perfect movie where you have a couple of characters that completely draws the viewers attention away from the main characters and the main story. In general the whole movie is pretty silly where Shigeharu Aoyama going blind for a girl that very clearly seem to not have purified flour in her sack literary as well and where his friend warns him a several times  and as for many characters in this film he just disappearing like fading out from the story until we're left with only the psycho girl the father and the son at the end of the movie. I felt something where missing in this film and there where just too many restaurant shoots which could be left out and instead used to let us know more about the sub characters such as Rie Shigehiko Aoyama and his new friend and the women at the office. To add the last words showing up severed body parts and a guy with missing body parts in a sack is NOT equal to the most violence and disturbing movie ever. Not by far.".

H.P.L.'s short story 'Cool Air' provided some inspiration for one of the film's segments. Lovecraft's stories  notoriously short on dialog and female characters  do not easily lend themselves to direct cinematic adaptation. Consequently Brian Yuzna deserves credit for extracting many essential elements from the Mythos and presenting them in a way contemporary horror audiences can appreciate.

	schema:headline " Not a bad anthology";
	schema:reviewBody "Necronomicon is a horror anthology loosely based on the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Lovecraft regular and Bmovie icon Jeffrey Combs gets to perform as Lovecraft himself in the wraparound story for this movie which involves Lovecraft reading stories from the 'Necronomicon' inside a library.The first story titled The Drowned follows the story of a house in which a man resurrected his dead wife and son with the help of the Necronomicon. This tale is directed by Christophe Gans the same man that went on to direct the French horror hit Brotherhood of the Wolf. This tale is well directed Christophe manages to create the right atmosphere for the house and the special effects are surprisingly well executed especially upon the appearance of the demon god towards the end. Surprisingly it is the story that lets this tale down. After a delightful sequence in which we see an elderly man consumed by the loss of his family throw his bible into the fire and then resurrect his family with the Necronomicon the tale is unable to suitably follow it up and the ending disappoints as it doesn't go anywhere it doesn't have a point to it and it leaves it feeling rather empty.The second tale is without doubt the best of the three and is worth the film's running time on it's own. This tale titled The Cold and based on the Lovecraft story Cool Air follows the story of a reporter that is sent to a woman's house to investigate a series of murders. The lady of the house tells her story of how the murders occurred and through this story a great sense of mystery and intrigue is built up and it makes you want to find out what the truth is behind the events. Unlike the first tale this tale is not skilfully directed and also unlike the first tale it has a story that is more than enough to carry it despite this. This tale also features a predictable but non the less satisfying twist at it's conclusion.The third and final tale of the three titled Whispers is the darkest of the bunch. This tale is about a policewoman that follows a criminal known as The Butcher into an old abandoned house. This story is directed by the accomplished horror director Brian Yuzna whom horror fans will recognise instantly as the producer of the horror classic ReAnimator and the underrated From Beyond as well as the director of both the ReAnimator sequels and the under acclaimed horror gem Return of the Living Dead part 3. His dark and repulsive style is shown abundantly in this tale. Despite its dark and creepiness this is unfortunately the weakest of the three tales. This is a shame because it has a great set up and it does feature some really nice moments such as the brain dead cop and the atmospheric 'cave'. This tale is also the goriest and most horrifying of the three and its lack of a coherent plot is most definitely its downfall.The film is finished off with the conclusion to the wraparound tale which stars Jeffrey Combs. The conclusion feels rather rushed and is something of a ripoff of the ending of the first tale. This is a shame because the film ends on a limp note rather than an exciting one and it therefore doesn't leave a good taste in the viewer's mouth.Necronomicon is not essential viewing or even recommended viewing but if you just want a film that will entertain you for 90 minutes then you could do a lot worse.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lovecraft's stories don't translate well to film. Much of their effect comes from the personal horror the characters feel at what they're seeing and it would take a true filmmaking genius to bring something like that across if such a person has existed they have not taken aim at Lovecraft's works. The other problem is that it's hard to stretch his short stories out into movie length. Those who try usually introduce elements that distract from the true flavor and atmosphere of the stories. Necronomicon falls into that trap despite preserving the short stories as separate segments. The first story which combines elements of The Strange High House in the Mist and The Shadow over Innsmouth among others is the most successful at preserving the evil and terrifying atmosphere of Lovecraft's works. The second is a direct adaptation of Cool Air a story whose one cool concept doesn't adapt well to a segment of this length. The third segment actually based on The Nameless City and not The Whisperer in Darkness as some here have said winds up being a hamhanded gorefest with no finesse and only a casual relationship to Lovecraft's work. It's not as though gore wasn't an element in Lovecraft's stories with characters being torn to ribbons and all but it always takes the form of horrifying and unspeakable things that happen and is never present for cheap thrills' sake as it is here. If you're a fan of Lovecraft's stories you'll probably want to see it. You might not like it very much but you'll want to see it anyway. If you really like cheesy horror films it'll entertain you. But if you want a good horror film or a good adaptation of H.P.Lovecraft's works keep moving.".

	schema:reviewBody "H.P. Lovecraft's gloomy short stories about obsession and the supernatural monsters that lurk all around us unnoticed by society at large naturally lend themselves to a multistoried omnibus fright film format. Well this trio of truly terrifying tales does the master full justice combining both supremely sepulchral midnightinthegraveyard moodiness and jumpoutatyou startling straightforward shocks with often genuinely frightening results.First yarn The Drowned  Wealthy Bruce Payne inherits a crumbling old seaside hotel that unbeknown to Payne has a foul carnivorous demon residing in the murky basement. Directed with exceptional style and grace by Chistopher Gans this particularly chilling humdinger is highlighted by Richard Lynch's touching turn as a bitter man who renounces his faith in God after losing his wife and child in a shipwreck and directtovideo erotic thriller perennial Maria Ford's strikingly eerie ethereal and even strangely sexy cameo as Payne's dead girlfriend who's resurrected as a ghostly pallid mossyhaired zombie.Second vignette The Cold  Sweet young runaway Bess Myer rents a room at a shabby apartment with a lonely reclusive scientist movingly played by David Warner residing on the weirdly freezing top floor. When Myer befriends the sad fragile Warner she learns that he has discovered the secret of immortality which not surprisingly comes at an especially terrible price Warner can only remain alive by constant fresh injections of human spinal fluid! Director Shusuke Kaneko manages to milk considerable poignancy from this haunting parable about the horrible price one must pay for cheating fate coaxing fine supporting performances from Millie Perkins as Warner's protective landlady Gary Graham as Myers' abusive incestuous brute stepbrother and Dennis Christopher as a foolishly snoopy newspaper reporter.Third and most gruesome anecdote Whispers  Gungho female cop Signy Coleman and her more sensible partner Obba Babatunde stumble across the dark dank and forbidding underground lair of these ancient subterranean monsters with a voracious appetite for bone marrow. Director Brian Yunza eschews the spooky atmospherics of the previous segments for a graphically visceral approach that's crudely effective in a gory mondo disgusto gross you out hideous sort of way. Return of the Living Dead 's Don Calfa and Judith Drake are wonderfully quirky as the nutty old couple guardians of the savage flesheating flying beasts who need new victims to keep their race thriving for all eternity.All these stories in and of themselves certainly smoke as does the thankfully solid wraparound narrative starring Lovecraft movie vet Jeffrey ReAnimator From Beyond Combs who's perfectly cast as the author himself who visits a secret library to check out the legendary tome of evil Necronomicon and almost gets killed in the process. Barely recognizable under heavy makeup which makes him resemble a gaunt Bruce Campbell Combs simply shines in a role he was seemingly destined to portray. Moreover the uniformly superb special effects by such dependable artists as Tom Savini Todd Masters and Screaming Mad George are as ghastly and grotesque as they ought to be the splatter is likewise properly revolting and plentiful the tone suitably creepy throughout and most importantly the individual stories ultimately cohere into a provocative and penetrating meditation on man's tenuous hold on reality exposing a scary netherworld that if intruded upon by us stupidly inquisitive mortals can prove to be quite deadly and dangerous.

	schema:reviewBody "Good props good music good scenery good lighting and competent actors with Jeffrey Combs at the helm of the wrap around make this movie worth watching. The main plot is kept delightfully simple  H.P. Lovecraft goes to a monastery library to catch a forbidden glimpse of the Necronomicon. He steals the key to a gated chamber where he finds a safe containing the Necronomicon setting off a mysterious mechanism that apparently locks him inside. He then sits at the table flip open his writing tablet and rather than copying pages he proceeds to write three stories inspired by the fishy effervescence of alien magic contained therein.That's when things get weirder than they already are. Not for the character but for the viewer. The average viewer is not nearly familiar enough with Lovecraft's writings to understand how he portrayed the traditional family unit and therefore how to understand what the movie producers were trying to translate onto film. Family and procreation in Lovecraft stories were at best only relevant in terms of interbreeding with aliens shadow over innsmouth at worse a social mechanism that has the capacity to deevolve humans into violent primates lurking fear. Lovecraft made no bones about it  the family that stays together gets strange together.Without a lens of literary context to see this movie through it's no wonder that it ultimately translates into an antiabortion message. You have one character that is a perpetually pregnant woman and another character that is bargaining to continue her pregnancy to save her own life. Perhaps the producers of this movie should have considered how these elements would affect the female half of the audience rather than just hoping everyone would get it.With that said I have no reason to believe that there is an anti abortion message in this movie particularly since the first story burns a Bible early on. If that doesn't establish where this movie stands in terms of religious values I'm not sure what will. Also a horror movie is probably the worst place to try to send an antiabortion message and certainly not from aliens that drink human bone marrow like a milkshake.I wanted to give this a 10 out of 10 as they did a great job with what they had to work with. However since literary context is necessary I am taking it down a notch since I have to once again encourage people to read Lovecraft to understand what's going on. For me the ideal Lovecraft movie would not only accurately express his literary vision but in such a way that the mainstream audience can understand it too.".

	schema:reviewBody "Loosely based on HP Lovecraft's necronomicon this film follows 3 short stories and a wraparound story. The First story rats in the walls follows a wealthy business man who inherits a mansion only to discover there's a giant tentacled monster living under it. The second The cold is easily the worst of em' all. It follows a Woman who recently moved to Boston only to discover the apartment above holds a nasty secret. The third which I found terrifyingly has a female cop and her partner apprehends a suspect into a factory only to discover something nightmarish waiting for them within. The wraparound story follows HP Lovecraft reading these tales found in the Necronomicon. I have very mixed feelings about this film. While the first one is the most Lovecraftian of them all it was really hard to enjoy it because it plods along quite sluggishly Maybe the fact that I watched the film at three o' clock in the morning contributed to this? despite some very interestinglooking creature effects By Screaming Mad George no less. the second one was hilarious. bad plot bad direction very little suspense Horrible Predictable ending. The only thing noteworthy in this segment is the presence of David Warner Titanicwho as usual gives an excellent performance. Too bad the rest of the segment sucked. The third in my opinion was creepy bizarre and terrifying. Signy Coleman gives an excellent performance as Sarah a female police officer stuck in well uh....hell. Or something like it. Loaded with style gore strong effects Some weak stopmotion notwithstanding and lots os sick and crazy images This is easily the best If least Lovecraftian of the bunch. I was very amused by the wraparound story in which genre favorite Jeffery Combs ReAnimator From Beyond and the Frighteners among other things and a cool effectspacked finale in which a cosmic extradimensional monster bites some poor schmuck's head off which is always entertaining. I Guess the last Segment and the Wraparound story are really the highlights. This film really could have been great if it wasn't for the truly awful second segment. I mean the plot itself had potential but the execution itself sucks due to a doofy screenplay and poor direction from Shusuke Kaneko Who had previously directed nothing but Godzilla and Gamera filmsWhy he was picked to direct I can't say. The performances as I mentioned before were Above Average. Screaming Mad George one of the most talented and underrated effects artists of all time cooks up plenty of gore and creatures many of which are very imaginative The giant oneeyed tentacleflinging monster at the end of the first segment was especially impressive and well realized with the lowbudget the film was clearly made upon. The film is overall decent but the slowmoving first segment and the atrocious second made it much much less entertaining that it could have been. My rating for Necronomicon4.510.".

Loaded with style gore strong effects Some weak stopmotion notwithstanding and lots os sick and crazy images This is easily the best If least Lovecraftian of the bunch. I was very amused by the wraparound story in which genre favorite Jeffery Combs ReAnimator From Beyond and the Frighteners among other things and a cool effectspacked finale in which a cosmic extradimensional monster bites some poor schmuck's head off which is always entertaining. I Guess the last Segment and the Wraparound story are really the highlights. This film really could have been great if it wasn't for the truly awful second segment. I mean the plot itself had potential but the execution itself sucks due to a doofy screenplay and poor direction from Shusuke Kaneko Who had previously directed nothing but Godzilla and Gamera filmsWhy he was picked to direct I can't say. The performances as I mentioned before were Above Average. Screaming Mad George one of the most talented and underrated effects artists of all time cooks up plenty of gore and creatures many of which are very imaginative The giant oneeyed tentacleflinging monster at the end of the first segment was especially impressive and well realized with the lowbudget the film was clearly made upon. The film is overall decent but the slowmoving first segment and the atrocious second made it much much less entertaining that it could have been. My rating for Necronomicon4.510.";

	schema:reviewBody "Lovecraft's and the other writers of the common mythos' work is SO difficult to translate to film. Attempts to illustrate the alludedto but barely observed horror of most of the genre tend to fail because the substance is not generally visual. It is a state of mind. Lovecraft paints a picture of terrified paranoia where the haunted protagonist is alone in what he sees trapped in the inability to communicate the reality of his dire predicament except by rambling about shunned this and forbidden that... It is rarely possible to get inside the head of the victim to see what he sees because stripped of its out of the corner of your eye fleeting impression playing on your mind quality it also tends to get stripped of its horror and become fairly standard Gothic splatter or just camp. Reanimator is a fine case of camp. Dunwich Horror is Gothic..The only superlative translation in my opinion is Dagon a fairly close following of The Shadow Over Innesmouth as I recall. Strangely something that captures the feel rather than any particular plot would be Carpenter's Mouth of Madness... a portrait of a state of mind rather than encounters.I think that Necronomicon  NOT the book of the dead but more properly the book of dead names or a similar near translation  is a film that attempts to look behind the veil rather than standing in a panic contemplating the veil itself. In doing this it runs all sorts of risks and I believe that it largely succeeds. The stories have been discussed enough here but the final buckets of blood and latex offering actually carries the idea with it of the utter alienness that is the horror that Lovecraft perceives. Unfortunately most viewers revulsion will be at the splatter and sticky redness and barriers will go up at yet another bag of sinews chucked around the studio as the automatic filing system kicks in and the brain immediately categorises it with chainsaw massacres and cannibal holocausts and various other films showing interplanetary roadkill or hellraised skintearing as the end point in audience manipulation.If we can bear with the direction a little It's not the Ickiness that revolts us.. it's only a vehicle to carry the REAL horror of complete and utter lostness  the certainty of a destiny that is so awful that it's something that medieval visions of Hell can only vaguely hint at. Lovecraft was genuinely terrified by it and afraid to look at it head on because he believed that it would drive him completely mad... and if we try and do it for him we either miss the point or see smoke and mirrors. Film is not the best medium for this. Literature and maybe music and drama tends to work better but we demand films and the best we get is interpretation that runs the risk of the viewer not getting it. Usually of course the film maker doesn't get it either which is why most Gothic horror becomes so camp translated to screen although this works rather well as entertainment in different ways.Thankyou Hammer.Necronomicon is a brave effort to translate Lovecraft's vision to the screen. It's not perfect by any means but I'm still going to give it 9 for valour".

The wraparound segment has Jeffrey Combs playing Lovecraft. He sneaks his way into the secret room in a library where the Necronomicon is kept and proceeds to read three stories from it. The first story The Drowning has Richard Lynch as a man who kills his wife and son in an accident and proceeds to turn to the elder gods to resurrect them. The second story The Cold has David Warner as a mad scientist who is possibly over 100 years. He falls for young tenant Bess Meyer and reveals his secret of immortality. The third segment Whispers stars Signy Coleman as a cop who follows the man who kidnapped her partner and lover Obba Babatunde into the depths of an old apartment building. All these stories are very goofy but they are when it comes down to it totally freaky. The practical gore effects are superb and are at least on par if not better than the Stuart Gordon Lovecraft adaptations.".

	schema:headline " The Book of the Dead  Care to read?";
	schema:reviewBody "Theoretically speaking this is one horror movie concept that couldn't possibly have gone wrong! Necronomicon is an anthology embracing three lesser known stories at least to me they were lesser known by the legendary novelist H.P. Lovecraft filmed by an interesting variation of directors and moreover linked together through an inventive wraparound story that revolves on Lovecraft himself as played by Jeffrey Combs who else?. Heck even the title vividly speaks to the imagination of us true horror fanatics as surely everyone will recognize the Book of the Dead either from previous Lovecraft adaptationsnovels and if not certainly from Sam Raimi's splatterclassic The Evil Dead. Basically we've got every necessary ingredient to cook up a wondrously delicious horror smrgsbord here but somehow the end result nevertheless left a rather sour aftertaste in my mouth Each and every separate Lovecraft short story is superb and more than often embodies the true definition of sheer genuine  terror but the teleplays are underdeveloped and never fully capture the dark and ominous atmosphere that Lovecraft had in mind when he wrote them. Considering the surreal themes and sinister setting these should have been stories that spontaneously inflict nightmares and cause phobias amongst the viewers but sadly it never comes to that. You feel emotionless the entire time. It's actually hard to explain  Necronomicon seemingly has it all from solid subject matter over stylistic filming aspects onto nauseating gore effects and yet something essential is missing. The wraparound as stated above introduces Lovecraft himself sneaking into a dark  secret library chamber because he heard the place hides a copy of the allegedly mythical book The Necronomicon. With the suspiciously eerie librarians observing his every move Lovecraft reads to us three stories of the macabre. The Necronomicon is simultaneously the leading thread running through the stories as all the protagonists come into contact with the book one way or the other. The first segment has a Swedish heir returning to the ancient family hotel by the seaside. He learns that his ancestor lost his beloved wife and child in a shipwreck but managed to bring them back to life through forces hidden inside the hotel. Since Edward also was responsible for the dead of his girlfriend in a car crash he hopes to discover the secret and bring her back from the other side as well. Obviously not the best of ideas  The Drowned is my personal least favorite story of the three but I do have to acknowledge it's a stylish contribution. Director Christophe Gans Brotherhood of the Wolf takes the maximum out of the marvelous seaside location and the morbid old hotel. The flashback with Richard Lynch as the archetypal sea captain ancestor is masterfully handled as well. However Bruce Payne's stonecold performance as well as the hideously abrupt anticlimax plummet the quality level enormously. The second story entitled The Cold is my choice for best segment. It's about a sleazy journalist who knocks at the door of a large mansion and brutally confronts the lady of the house with the mystery of why so many people vanished after having visited this place. She has no option but to tell him about her mother's acquaintance with the brilliant previous tenant  Dr. Madden  who developed a unique but sinister method for preserving his youth and virility. One slight disadvantage though it requires a lot of human spinal fluid and must remain safeguarded in a cold environment. Personally I'm a sucker for horror stories revolving on the quest for immortality like The Rejuvenator and all the movies about Countess Bathory especially when they feature an outrageously overthetop mad scientist character like David Warner in this case! The Cold has a marvelous storywithinstory structure that nearly isn't confusing as it sounds and benefices from the most properly finished screenplay of all three stories. This is also the only segment that finds the exact right balance between juicy grossout effects and high level of tension. Not bad for a Japanese director that allegedly couldn't speak a word of English on the set! The third and final story has director Brian Yuzna's trademarks all over it. Whispers is an indescribably nasty and sickening illustration of what pure hell is most likely to look like. This segment is lacking substantially but you'll nevertheless stare with your eyes and mouth wide open as it is a nonstop spitfire of pitchdark and ghastly images. Unfortunately they are not really disturbing or scary  just very very unpleasant! Two police officers are chasing a car down to a grim neighborhood and literally end up in a subterranean labyrinth of terror. Words even file to describe the atrocities they encounter there including petrifying elderly folks flying carnivorous demons and extraterrestrial butchers. I like a good portion of gore and bloodshed but this particular segment was quite unbearable. In general Necronomicon is definitely a mixed bag. Those who claim that the 90's only brought forward derivative inferior and non atmospheric horror turkeys should check it out because it's certainly one of the better efforts of the decade. Still like that other 90's Lovecraft adaptation The Resurrected this movie can't hold a candle to some of the earlier  albeit admittedly loosely interpreted  movies based on the writer's repertoire like ReAnimator and From Beyond. I'm sure many people will beg to differ but I think even Lucio Fulci came closer to capturing the real mindset of Lovecraft when he looked for inspiration for City of the Living Dead and House by the Cemetery.".

Lovecraft fans may be delighted by the movie and may recognize some of the stories but that is the only single fact to entice anyone to watch this.

The final moment of the movie would unveil a grim truth probably rendering the protagonists insane. So having set the in my humble opinion optimal lovecraftian movie criteria let's watch Necronomicon! 90 of the movie's budget was probably spent on monster fx  a waste of resources! The acting is not very bright the characters barely believable. As for the stories they're a desecration of all things Lovecraft. Unconnected scenes. Almost completely unrelated to any book and devoid of sense they made me cover my eyes in shame. Someone here's written in a comment that this movie is for Lovecraft fans only. Boy were they wrong! If you're a Lovecraft fan stay away from this movie! Run like it's the Dunwich horror!.

The Film proudly stands along with his other classic such as Seven Samurai Yojimbo Roshomon Sanjuro and the Hidden Fortress. He is a master in the art of filmmaking no one can film an epic battle scene quite like Kurosawa. This is recognized as the most expensive film ever made by Akira Kurosawa it was at that time Japan's most expensive film ever. Being at the age of 75 he still showed us he's one of the best in the business.This movie is about an aging lord head of the Ichimonji family decides to retire and to pass the power to Taro the eldest of his three sons. He will however have to banish Saburo the youngest one who dared to speak the truth to him. Soon the former lord is chased away from the castles of his sons and becomes mad when he understands that one of his sons is trying to kill him. The three brothers are fighting for control of the Kingdom as their lust for power grows every day. Four armies are facing each other on the prairie. Lord Ichimonji's former peaceful kingdom is nothing but a distant memory.Akira Kurosawa redefines what an epic film is with astonishing story telling entirely believable characters and real life battle scenes without the use of Special effectsCGI. He retells the story of King Lear in his own way and no one would recognize that it was actually a adaptation beforehand. But just like Shakespeare there is humor irony death and not a happy ending. Everyone who played a part in the production of this film deserves some kind of recognition. The acting is pretty much excellent and certainly believable.1010 Kurosawa is a Genius".

	schema:headline " The Greatest Shakespeare Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Throughout his career Kurosawa strove to achieve what he called real cinema proclaiming that in all his films there's only three or four minutes of such quality. Many would argue that he was his greatest critic. For if not in Seven Samurai then definitely in Ikiru and if not in High and Low then definitely in Rashomon he must have achieved this plateau of greatness. Well if not in any of his other films then definitely in Ran Kurosawa finally came to the apex of cinematic artistry. With the both lyrical and grandiose tone of its craft its beautifully spare imagery its haunting score by Toru Takemitsu and its lead Tatsuya Nakadai's masterful understated performance Ran is perhaps the most fully realized epic ever made.The tale which is an adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear begins as Lord Hidetora Ichimonji and his court are out hunting. During a break in the hunt Hidetora proclaims his adbication from the hight seat of the Great Lord and bestows his lands unto his three sons dividing them up equally. He declares his oldest to be his successor in power. When his youngest son and one of his faithful nobles express their concerns on this idea Hidetora foolishly banishes them both mistaking their advice as insolence. With this opening scene the peaces are aligned and soon 'chaos' as the film is aptly named will break out throughout the land. From here we see the downfall of Hidetora and all those who surround him. The film retains all the themes of the original play but also thanks to Kurosawa's own input addresses a slew of even more varied ideas. Like Shakespeare Kurosawa is greatly interested in the responsibility of the leader and the hypocrisies and ironies of an autocratic system. The most obvious though not the central theme in the whole film is war and Kurosawa explores this theme to its full extent throughout the film. In perhaps the most grandiose battle scene every filmed he demonstrates the destructive consequences and the paradoxical beauty of conflict.Here Kurosawa implements the camera with masterful skill not once employing the editingphotography tricks and gimmicks so often seen in films even the good ones today. This director has an awareness of the past and the history of film but also the creative spontaneity of a true genius. In Ran he focuses on the more methodically simple yet artistically complex montage of Eisenstein and on the strict compositions of Ozu. He employs the most basic and yet most artistic of techniques. Each shot is planned to precision and each cut is made for a purpose. The coreagraphy and blocking of each scene is simple and powerful and Kurosawa allows the actors to play out these scenes without the intrusion of the camera or the editor. Thus the director prevents the style from eclipsing the already powerful material he has to work with. Simply put Ran is a masterpiece that flows and develops like an opera from its forebodingly peaceful ouverture to its bloody Shakespearean heart until its final quietly subdued and sorrowful denouement.".

However one of his sons sees this as unwise and is banished by his father leaving his two brothers in charge of two of the three castles left in their hands. It isn't long before they are overtaken by greed and eventually betray their father leaving him in the hands of a philosophical jester and a loyal retainer. This betrayal ultimately leads to war dividing the family and driving Hidetora insane.The remarkable script which contains many of my favorite lines from any film still manages to break its way through the confinement of subtitles and reveals itself to be one of the richest Kurosawa ever wrote. He has obviously worked equally hard on the look and feel of the film  the cinematography being excellent example the long continuous shot of Saburo's men charging on horseback across a river.There's also something rather frightening about it that I can't quite put my finger on. The first battle which is the film's turning point is the most horrifying yet strangely beautiful battles ever filmed. A good effect used is the loss of sound with only Toru Takemitsu's haunting score to be heard. The entire battle lasts less than ten minutes and there is no uplifting or bombastic music to be heard but in my opinion it's Ran's finest scene and thus the finest scene ever.What Kurosawa managed to get rather than give though was excellent performances from his actors none more brilliant than Tatsuya Nakadai's Hidetora Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede a woman similar to Lady Macbeth but with a different hidden agenda and the strangelynamed Peter as Kyoami.".

A good effect used is the loss of sound with only Toru Takemitsu's haunting score to be heard. The entire battle lasts less than ten minutes and there is no uplifting or bombastic music to be heard but in my opinion it's Ran's finest scene and thus the finest scene ever.What Kurosawa managed to get rather than give though was excellent performances from his actors none more brilliant than Tatsuya Nakadai's Hidetora Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede a woman similar to Lady Macbeth but with a different hidden agenda and the strangelynamed Peter as Kyoami.";

	schema:headline " My third favorite Kurosawa film deliberately paced not painfully so heavy on tragedy and glorious in overall artistry";
	schema:reviewBody "I would agree with Ebert's review on a point that Akira Kurosawa legendary director of such samurai classics as Seven Samurai Yojimbo Hidden Fortress and Kagemusha as well as human dramas like Rashomon The Lower Depths and Red Beard could really best direct this film in his old age. There's something about his version of the doomed King Lear of Shakespeare his Lord Hidetora Ichimonji that could be truly captured by someone in old age. Not to say that directors can't make great films when they're young or in middle age about a man in the dark days of the golden years About Schmidt Tokyo Story Bob Le Flambeur and Kurosawa's own Ikiru come to mind. But it's clear that Kurosawa must've seen or felt or understood at least an element of Hidetora's character something that goes beyond tragedy that is stuck with all who are mortal. At one point when Hidetora is in a wandering dazed state he says I am lost to which his companioncaretaker Kyoami responds Such is the human condition. Was Kurosawa lost as an artist and filmmaker as he tried to get his epic which at the time of it's filming was the most expensive Japan had seen and got some extra backing from outside European backers off the page and onto celluloid? Hard to say but the end result displays that even in his later days he could create a work so wonderful so sad so brutal and so human that it will remain timeless. If Kurosawa deserves praise for look of the film the pacing the editing every single painstakingly storyboarded painted shot and his direction with the two battle sequences as well as with the quieter more compelling scenes with the actors the man who plays Hidetora deserves some as well like any production of King Lear including Godard's wild treatise with Burgess Meredith in the lead role the actor is as important as the writer. Tatsuya Nakadai who had roles in past Kurosawa films as a young man in Yojimbo the gunslinger and Sanjuro the opponent is aweinspiring. Early in the film after a mindshattering dream his character decides to split up his kingdom unto his three sons Jiro Saburo and getting the first castle and all control Taro he still feels in control and has the look of a Lord with just the right level of stubbornness and unfortunately naivety. Then as everything he owns crumbles before him there is one scene that struck me as remarkable and then for the rest of the film I couldn't take my eyes off of Nakadai whenever he was on screen. It involves the first battle sequence in which one of his son's comes to take over a castle and killing all of Hidetora's men. Look at Nakadai in the scene where he's sitting down stonefaced amid the chaos going on outside and then as he somehow manages to walk out the fellow soldiers making way for him. He then sees one of his sons the betrayer and he doesn't say a word he's already decided that his son Taro has gone too far with his position as he rules over his domain and scares the peasants right out of the picture and he simply walks away as his family continues to crumble under corruption of the mind and heart.It's a sequence like that though where the great Lord makes such a radical change where Kurosawa and Nakadai have some of their greatest time ever on a screen. As the filmmaker treats the battle up to a point like a feudalJapanese version of a Eisenstein battle no talk no sound effects just the eerie sorrowful score here applied by Toru Takemitsu with devastation and visceral nature taken to a poetic thoughtful level the actor's eyes and body language are well indescribable almost. And if Nakadai gives the finest male performance of the film credit is equally due to the pivotal female character Lady Kaede Mieko Harada who is like a Lady Macbeth taken to the next level. This is a character that's seen Lord Ichimonji destroy his castle when she was young and now that she has her sons right in the palm of her hand she'll have her revenge in guise of egofeeding. I may not be able to recommend Ran on one level despite it being on the painter's equivalent of a splendorous seething portrait of royalty. Kurosawa takes his time telling the story and to some it might even feel longer than his epic Seven Samurai. This is a work heavy on emotional nuance on how the characters in particular Hidetora look unto their surroundings how the presence of destruction and war and slayings are traumatic as opposed to being 'cool' in a stylistic way. If you're looking for a slambang action thriller look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a mature film about life death loss and the bonds that are kept within families the mind and how we accept and give forgiveness a blind character named Lord Tsurumaru is stunning from a certain point of view this is it. As well for the Shakespeare fan it's an absolute mustsee and it may even turn some onto Shakespeare's classic due to the fact that this film much like Throne of Blood contains none of the language style used in the source.".

	schema:headline " Greatest rendition of a Shakespearean Epic";
	schema:reviewBody "Ran is probably cinema's greatest rendition of a Shakespearean Epic ironically coming from an oriental filmmaker. Adapted by Kurosawa from Shakespeare's King Lear Ran undoubtedly features amongst the best works of the master auteur. It captures with sheer vividness and surreal resplendence the true essence of human struggle for survival highlighting the cruelties associated with life. Ran is strictly indicative of the sole consistency of life i.e. change an attribute that not only makes the humans vulnerable but also gives them the hope to rise after a fall. The story focuses on a senile warlord who owing to his senescence is rapidly losing his strength and his ferocious grandeur that he had earned through years of relentless savagery and ruthless slaughter ergo he renounces to his three sons hoping them to establish a sort of a triumvirate with the eldest son having a slight edge. His two elder sons accept the proposal with rapturous glee but his youngest son seems bemused and questions the wits of the patriarch for taking the untimely decision. Though arrantly annoyed by his son's audacious defiance he tries to console him only to find him inconsolable. Deeply hurt by his son's impertinence and censure he reluctantly banishes him and enthrones the two elder sons. The rest is rather worth a watch than a read for there is nothing that can better the sumptuous elegance of Ran. The brilliantly captured scenes are breathtaking to say the least especially the war scene that depicts fate casting the final blow to the ruthless reign of the warlord. The brutality and the bloodshed depicted in the very scene can make even a coldblooded appear jittery. Ran portrays the poetic justice in such a relentless and abominable fashion that one can't help but sympathize with the narcissistic warlord who spent his life arrogating and annihilating the innocent souls. The plaintive score gives the movie a much desired tone a mood that not only supports its melancholic backdrop but also immensely adds to its poignant beauty. The final scene featuring the blind boy deeply clutched by his haplessness and gross solitude though doesn't feature an utterance of even a single syllable the playback of the mystical flute makes the scene haunting as well as mesmerising and worth a thousand words. Ran is a classic example of Kurosawa's brilliance and perhaps a consummation of his apotheosis. A must watch for eclectic viewers and admirers of pristine cinema. Highly recommended 1010.".

	schema:headline " Sometimes given sufficient objectives even the people who are closer to you than anyone else can turn against you.";
	schema:reviewBody "In another lengthy samurai epic Akira Kurosawa approaches the boundaries between family members and the damaging affects of one of his rather common themes  reckless ambition. This is very clearly a Kurosawa film a respectable trait that is most clear in the cinematography in which Kurosawa uses many extensive shots with little to no camera movement as well as the common natural setting characterized by the farreaching landscapes of sweeping hillsides. Ran has a fascinating plot about an aging King who considers passing on his empire to his three sons. Lord Hidetora is well into his 70s maybe Kurosawa saw part of himself in this character? and he addresses the fact that he cannot go on ruling forever despite the fact that he fought for his empire for over 50 years. His youngest son disagrees with his proposition of passing on leadership yet maintaining much of his control yet Hidetora nonetheless divides his kingdom into three parts to his sons hoping that they will remain allies. As an incentive he demonstrates with arrows that a single one can be broken easily but three arrows together cannot be broken as easily. The three sons Taro Jiro and Saburo do not agree with Hidetora's philosophy and as new leaders of their respective portions of Lord Hidetora's kingdom they soon begin to fight each other for full leadership. Hidetora is attacked by his own sons and cast out of the kingdom left to wander hopelessly from castle to castle with no one but his goofy jester at his side who stays with the Lord entirely out of duty to him. One of Hidetora's three sons eventually returns and tries to patch up their damaged relationship but before they can do that he gets killed and Hidetora is left alone again and the empire that he worked for during most of his life is left in ruins. As is also common in Kurosawa's films there are a lot of interesting and significant characters in the film that play a substantial role in the story. When we first meet Lady Kaede the woman who was married to Taro but then forced her way into marriage with his younger brother Jiro the new Lord upon Taro's death she is holding a knife to Lord Jiro threatening him with blackmail if he does not accept her as his wife. The first thing that makes her interesting is that her objective in marrying Jiro is to ensure herself a comfortable life and so she can avoid fading into obscurity as the widow of a past Lord. Her blackmail threat has a lot of damaging potential for Jiro and he accepts her as his wife. From the very start of her role in the film her ultimate goal was to bring about the downfall of the kingdom in order to avenge her family who had been killed when Lord Hidetora was in power. This is not expected or even hinted at previously in the film and it gives her character much more depth.There is some great irony in Ran that occurs after Lord Hidetora is banished and is left wandering the endless plains. He and his jester come across a rundown wooden shack at the foot of a hillside and they approach it asking for help and shelter. The occupant after explaining that his home is too poor to offer any shelter turns out to be a man who as a boy had had his eyes gouged out under the orders of Lord Hidetora in exchange for sparing his life. Once the jester and Hidetora are inside the man explains that he will offer hospitality in the only way that Hidetora left him able he will play them music on his flute. In this scene Hidetora is confronted with the terrible suffering which he once imposed and it is horribly ironic that he is forced to take shelter from someone that he once devastatingly mutilated without a second thought. In Ran as was also the case in Kagemusha which is a very similar film in time period and content Kurosawa again employs a subtler style of directing. Again he focuses more on the story than on cinematic trickery and with spectacular results. The extensive use of the motionless camera is stunningly effective but he also uses it in a different way here. Ran opens with a series of stationary shots of a group of horses standing majestically with their riders on the top of a flowing hillside. Virtually the exact same image is shown from a fairly wide variety of different angles and distances indicating the vastness of the plains and the power that these characters hold or will soon hold over them. Again a musical score is entirely absent throughout the vast majority of the film and the same lengthy scenes are employed to a large extent to communicate the story of the film. An example of one of these exceedingly long takes can be seen early in the film when Lord Hidetora first announces his what he intends to do with the leadership of his kingdom. The ending of Ran is definitely realistic for many reasons. There are no myths perpetuated by it close family members do not always stand together even the noblest intentions are not always realized and no one lives happily ever after. Ran is the story of a man in a position of power who makes a trusting decision that backfires devastatingly and the ensuing madness is not altered to make way for a happy ending. It seems that Kurosawa was trying to capture the militarily charged atmosphere that is present in times of war and the things mentioned above are some of the many efforts he made to make it all as real as possible even at the expense of the audience's emotions.".

	onyx:emotionText "In another lengthy samurai epic Akira Kurosawa approaches the boundaries between family members and the damaging affects of one of his rather common themes  reckless ambition. This is very clearly a Kurosawa film a respectable trait that is most clear in the cinematography in which Kurosawa uses many extensive shots with little to no camera movement as well as the common natural setting characterized by the farreaching landscapes of sweeping hillsides. Ran has a fascinating plot about an aging King who considers passing on his empire to his three sons. Lord Hidetora is well into his 70s maybe Kurosawa saw part of himself in this character? and he addresses the fact that he cannot go on ruling forever despite the fact that he fought for his empire for over 50 years. His youngest son disagrees with his proposition of passing on leadership yet maintaining much of his control yet Hidetora nonetheless divides his kingdom into three parts to his sons hoping that they will remain allies. As an incentive he demonstrates with arrows that a single one can be broken easily but three arrows together cannot be broken as easily. The three sons Taro Jiro and Saburo do not agree with Hidetora's philosophy and as new leaders of their respective portions of Lord Hidetora's kingdom they soon begin to fight each other for full leadership. Hidetora is attacked by his own sons and cast out of the kingdom left to wander hopelessly from castle to castle with no one but his goofy jester at his side who stays with the Lord entirely out of duty to him.

	schema:reviewBody "I am not certain but I think Ran was Akira Kurosawa's last big feature. Visually It might be his most distinctive. Being in color opens a lot of doors to cinematography and makes it easier to see how much artistic creativity went into the sets and costumes. There is something else distinctive about Ran. It is his slowest picture. You need extreme patience to make it through this very long movie and you also need to understand the context of the story.Ran is Kurosawa's retelling of Shakespeare's King Lear which many scholars say is his most difficult tragedy. The premise is identical revolving around an old monarch who is ruined by the corruption of his sons after he gives them power and authority. In King Lear they were daughters not sons of course. Ran starts and ends strongly but the problem comes down to a huge plodding middle section. This part of the film will really test your attention span. Kurosawa deliberately makes sure that nothing happens because he wants to evoke one single emotion...isolation. He places his principal character and a couple of others in the middle of nowhere with no story progression music or major dialog. There are perhaps one or even two too many similarly grim scenes.The battles scenes are the biggest in Kurosawa's forty year body of work. Not only do they feature swords and spears but guns cannons and a cast of thousands. The interesting thing about those scenes is that Kurosawa doesn't intend them to be rousing or exciting. Instead there is a strange emotional feeling generated. The most memorable part of Ran is the very last sequence which is visually brilliant and really disturbing. He makes a metaphor about the frailty of humanity by showing a blind man in a very particular place.Ran will leave you thinking long and hard. I have not seen a film like it and I don't think I ever will. It is not my favorite Kurosawa but it is very much worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "He who knows others is wise. He who knows himself is enlightened.  Tao Te ChingRan begins with a gorgeous sequence director Akira Kurosawa treating us to several shots of soldiers on horseback perched like gargoyles on a series of grassy hills. We assume these men are guarding the borders of some ancient Japanese kingdom but it turns out they're running security escort for King Hidetora an elderly warlord who is out hunting with his three sons.The film then quickly becomes a loose retelling of Shakespeare's King Lear Hidetora announcing his retirement and then proceeding to divide his kingdom equally between his three sons. In true Shakespearean fashion Hidetora then stands back and watches with sadness as his spawn squabble and wage war each interested in acquiring more power and respect than the other.But Ran is not simply a threeway battle between sons. One of the things that becomes apparent with repeated viewings are the subtle power plays being made behind the family. For example rival warlords form alliances with the three brothers in an attempt to instigate battles between them and the wife of one brother Lady Kaede moves like a serpent constantly plotting against the King and his sons.Initially we sympathises with King Hidetora. After all the poor guy loses his family and is forced to watch helplessly as his empire crumbles! But gradually we learn more and more about Hidetora's past Kurosawa reveals that Hidetora was himself once a ruthless warlord who destroyed kingdoms and killed thousands. By the film's end we've thus witnessed a grand cycle being reset. Hidetora built his empire through violence and bloodshed and lost it likewise one ruthless King essentially falling whilst another rises to take his place.So Ran which means chaos in Japanese is less about King Hidetora's personal tragedy than it is about human tragedy on a much larger more cosmic scale. Observe how Kurosawa uses various distancing techniques he frequently cuts away to shots of cloud filled skies in an attempt to convey the feeling that we are watching these characters and their petty squabbles from the heavens. With shades of Jancso The Red and White and Kubrick Paths of Glory the sublime Lyndon Kurosawa's camera grants us the vantage point of enlightened Gods.Interestngly Ran's aesthetic style is completely different to much of Kurosawa's early work. Kurosawa's pace is slow his camera rarely moves closeup shots are rare the film's acting is stylized and mannered drawing from Japanese Noh theatre though perhaps also Brecht? and characters are held at a distance. Most find this grating  none of the ingratiating of say a David Lean epic  but this is a more mature deeper and less imitable Kurosawa. Whilst his earlier features have been imitated to death perhaps to the point where they have lost some of their power Ran remains sublime.Gone also are the usual Kurosawan moral platitudes. There is little preaching here and few of the trite moral lessons and dips into sentimentality that mar many of Kurosawa's early films. Indeed it seems that Kurosawa only matured into a serious artist in the years leading up to and after his failed suicide attempt. He achieved a sort of gerotranscendence with his later films shifting to a more transcendent vision of the world. These films thus have a very holistic view of time and space life and death moving away from egocentricism to a more cosmic worldview. Perhaps such an artistic shift was spurred on by Kurosawa's own existential crisis in the early 70s.King Hidetora himself achieves gerotranscendence after a failed suicide. It is then that he stumbles upon a blind man who was once the victim of his past savagery. Forced to directly confront his past his self image no longer based on illusions of heroism and glory Hidetora promptly becomes a tormented spirit. Kurosawa has him wear a white face mask from this point onwards tearing across the landscape like a ghost.Ran ends with a powerful sequence. An army marches in the foreground whilst far in the distance a blind man walks dangerously close to a cliff's edge tentatively tapping away at the earth with his walking cane. The man's walking cane then hits open air he stumbles slightly and the film abruptly ends. Kurosawa's point is clear humanity is blind perpetually on the verge of tumbling down some dark abyss. But note too how the blind man is elevated far above the army down below. He may risk falling but he unlike most in the film has begun his long climb back toward virtue. Ran is packed with similar cleanly drawn metaphors though at times Kurosawa's dialogue is ridiculously direct. Entire sequences of the film spell out Kurosawa's themes character dialogue signposting the director's moral messages at every turn. It's all at times very hokey subtler in Japanese?.Needless to say Kurosawa's compositions and use of colour are dazzling. At times the film seems like a series of landscape paintings and the master's soundtrack is also fairly experimental.Note to younger viewers preconceptions in tow there are no cool samurai battles here only a melancholic battle sequence which Kurosawa shoots without sound. Such sequences are nightmarish rather than gratuitous Kurosawa balking at the horror that other directors salivate over. Ran's stylized acting also takes some getting used to requiring several viewings to fully absorb the film's various character motivations traits names nuances and faces. One character a copy of the court jester in King Lear is particularly annoying until we properly tune in to his role. Like Shakespeare's jester he exists outside the story designed to comment on man's follies.9.510  Despite some heavyhanded dialogue this is arguably Kurosawa's best film and one which rewards or gets richer with repeat viewings something few films genuinely do.".

	schema:headline " Awe Inspiring";
	schema:reviewBody "At the core of this movie there is a long running philosophical question. Certain characters continually question what is happening around them and through these questions the themes of the movie are forthcoming. The most obvious theme is that of war. Here once again Kurosawa reminds us that modern warfare is not a place of honour or duels but massed attacks on faceless enemies shooting each other from a distance. I will discuss the battle scenes later in this review they help us examine the chaos that is again consistent throughout the film. It seems that no one in this movie has any control over the events that are transpiring not even the ultimate manipulator Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede has true control. This lack of control seems to mirror the idea put forward by the only character who is continually able to tell the truth without ramification. Shinnosuke Ikehata credited here as Peter is the fool who says 'Are there no gods... no Buddha? If you exist hear me. You are mischievous and cruel! Are you so bored up there you must crush us like ants? Is it such fun to see men weep?' Even if god exists then the only pleasure he enjoys is watching mankind destroy itself in the chaotic mess that is war. The final scenes see chaos erupt as through the good natured actions of one man 4 armies are dragged into a bloody battle. Which leads us to the idea of futility and death. The pointlessness of life is summed up once again by the fool. 'Man is born crying. When he has cried enough he dies.' Death comes to us all yet it is far bleaker than that. If there is a god then they allow everyone to suffer. Even a noble character like Saburo dies an ignoble and futile death. Everyone within this movie is both hunter and hunted. It is a bleak world indeed.Then we have morality. There are very few 'good' characters here but there are three exceptions to this. Saburo Lord Hidetora's third and youngest son who because of his love and loyalty to his father is unable to not speak out at the foolishness he sees around him which leads to his banishment. Tango a loyal servant to Lord Hidetora who is banished with Saburo but through love for his lord disguises himself so as to stay near him. Finally there is Kyoami the fool. He again is loyal to his Lord however he voices ideas of leaving his side numerous times but again his sense of duty and even affection keep him with his master.The movie itself is near perfect. Stylistically it is almost like watching a play. Both the staging and the style of acting are clearly very influenced by Japanese Noh theatre with the slow and deliberate style of acting used and the masklike appearance of age notable in the make up of Nakadai as the seventy year old Hiderota. Every shot looks like a masterpiece perfectly framed. Kurosawa trained as an artist indeed he painted the storyboard for every shot in the film. The framing is perfect and in most senses the camera does not move at all or if it does it is simply to keep the perfection of the shot intact. Kurosawa was a master film maker this is clear throughout. His confidence with film is breathtaking only a director totally sure in his craft would dare leave the long motionless pauses at the end of almost every scene punctuating what has just happened and allowing the audience to grasp the full implication of the actions taking place.Kurosawa is of course well known for his ability to direct action and this movie recreates war in a way few others have ever managed to do. There are two great battles here one in the middle and one during the end. The final battle is perfectly staged riveting and speaks volumes of the futility that the lust and pride of Jiro Masatoras Hiderotas second son played by Jinpachi Nezu has led to. But for me it is the first battle that is the one of the greatest moments in cinema. Due to council given by a traitor Lord Hidetora has led his household which includes 30 warriors to the castle of the outcast Saburo. It is a trap and Taro Takatora Akira Terao his first son and Jiro strike. What follows is horrific. This is the purist language of movie and a thing of true genius. On the battlefield even in the world of the Samurai there is no honour no real glory only ugliness and death.It is interesting to note that seeing someone actually kill another person in this movie is rare. Considering the acclaim Kurosawa has garnered for the sword fighting sequences in so many of his movies it is interesting to note that not once do you see a sword kill another person on screen. Indeed there are only two times we really witness one person attacking and killing another other than mutual suicide. The first is entirely shown at a massive distance the figures barely distinguishable and the second despite being amazingly gory does not actually show the death itself on camera.Yet with all of this emphasis on framing shot symbolism and colour Kurosawa manages to bring to the screen some of the greatest performances I think I have ever witnessed. I have to cut short my praise of what is a faultless cast and talk about Mieko Harada giving perhaps the finest performance in the movie. Driven by anger and vengeance she becomes something other than human she is some kind of succubus a temptress a foxspirit. Harada is at all times compelling her every movement one of cold perfection and as we hear her silk robes rustling as she glides along the wooden floors we see before us an unforgettable creation of pure evil.".

	onyx:emotionText "At the core of this movie there is a long running philosophical question. Certain characters continually question what is happening around them and through these questions the themes of the movie are forthcoming. The most obvious theme is that of war. Here once again Kurosawa reminds us that modern warfare is not a place of honour or duels but massed attacks on faceless enemies shooting each other from a distance. I will discuss the battle scenes later in this review they help us examine the chaos that is again consistent throughout the film. It seems that no one in this movie has any control over the events that are transpiring not even the ultimate manipulator Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede has true control. This lack of control seems to mirror the idea put forward by the only character who is continually able to tell the truth without ramification. Shinnosuke Ikehata credited here as Peter is the fool who says 'Are there no gods... no Buddha? If you exist hear me. You are mischievous and cruel! Are you so bored up there you must crush us like ants? Is it such fun to see men weep?' Even if god exists then the only pleasure he enjoys is watching mankind destroy itself in the chaotic mess that is war. The final scenes see chaos erupt as through the good natured actions of one man 4 armies are dragged into a bloody battle. Which leads us to the idea of futility and death. The pointlessness of life is summed up once again by the fool. 'Man is born crying. When he has cried enough he dies.' Death comes to us all yet it is far bleaker than that. If there is a god then they allow everyone to suffer. Even a noble character like Saburo dies an ignoble and futile death. Everyone within this movie is both hunter and hunted. It is a bleak world indeed.Then we have morality. There are very few 'good' characters here but there are three exceptions to this.

In this he fails  so many problems here. First Shakespeare wrote plays for a barren stage where the images grow from the mind supported by superrich language and interwoven visual metaphor.

Kurosawa tries it backwards here by placing characters is a vast scheme that came from his own mind offscreen as it were and it doesn't quite work.As it happens Ran's emphasis is on grand motion. Little time is spent on character development except with the scheming wife of the first son a story element that has little Shakespearean counterpart. Lear is a play about demons and leaves the question open as to how many are from opportunistic devilment and which are internally generated. All this is discarded here as well as the Gloucester counterplot. Among the great losses from the source are the continuous examinations of what sight means and what it can conceive. How fertile that would have been as dramatic scaffolding for Kurosawa's vision.There's a problem with language as well. Not knowing Japanese I cannot judge how rich or intricate in metaphor is the film's dialogue. But the sound and dramatic utility of the speech is about as far from Shakespeare as you can get. Shakespeare uses his actors' speech to simultaneously move the dramatic action and to serve as a surrogate for the viewer's mind. Both the story and your own ruminations on the story are contained therein. This depends on a continuous predictable assumed rythmic base which is articulated by a rich consonant based cheating rubato. Japanese consists of staccato vowels that I suspect are overly dramatized in the short blasts we get from these characters. Could hardly be more unShakespearean. I assume there is a Noh legacy being mined here instead which is not available to this western viewer.A side note after seeing these battle scenes you'll never appreciate Speilberg's blatant ripoff in the first part of Sgt Ryan.".

Ran Kurosawa's 1985 film based somewhat on Shakespeare's King Lear is the story of an elderly emperor who hands down his kingdom to the oldest of his three sons. While the oldest and middle son fan over each other saying that they are not deserving etc. it is the youngest who speaks his mind about the subject incurring the wrath of his father and ultimately banishment from the area. Meanwhile the two older sons are making a mess of things with the kingdom leading to wars fratricide and the dismissal of their father even attempting his murder. None of their motives are noble or honorable only avarice and power motivate them leading to tragedy for all.Going into this I knew that this was not going to be a light story by any means. For anyone who has read or is familiar with Lear it is a story that is pretty much slogged through though it is wonderfully told. Ran can pretty much be described the same way. While I certainly appreciated the good acting the unbelievable costumes and the set design as a whole I found myself unable to become engaged in the story. The pacing was extremely slow certainly not an easy thing to deal with during a film that lasts about 2 hours and 40 minutes. Unfortunately for myself at least it is the pacing visuals and story that can really make a foreign film a success for me and I found that Ran only had one compelling element out of the three which managed to save it from being an absolute dud but not enough to make it as awesome as Kurosawa's other films are. And in using the word awesome I really mean the word awe Because of the costumes at times arresting imagery and the ultimate fate of Lady Kaede which bumped up the film by an entire point for me because of its bluntness I'm not completely panning the film. While I feel the film was a bit disappointing I'm more disappointed in myself for not being able to like it as much as I would have wanted since it has had such amazing reviews. But since you can't like them all Ran gets a 510 from me.Shelly".

	schema:reviewBody "Kurosawa had fallen out of favour by this time in his career. Ran had been meticulously storyboarded by the director himself painting colours and conceptualising the masterpiece in his mind years and years before he finally got the funding for what was the most expensive Japanese film at the time. The third and last of his Shakespeares Ran tells the story of the old King Lear figure Hidetora. But there is a key difference Shakespeare never delved into the details of the old king's past conquests and rulings but here Hidetora is painted as a warlike persona brutal and ruthless in his day. Fast forward years and the ageing warlord cannot even commit seppuku with the katana he so once viciously brandished. The opening shots are almost garish in their use of colour. We do not expect the three heralded sons to be kitted out in the bright primaries of red yellow and blue. We get wide shots of the clear blue sky of endless grassy hills from all directions of the four riders as they look each way. Kurosawa's penchant for waiting for the perfect weather conditions pays off because after banishment the clouds suddenly come out and the grass is dull in the billowing wind. When Jiro's crimson army arrives to face Saburo a cloud envelops the plain and again when his envoy rides across the plain bringing with him a false message of truce and an ominous shadow alongside. In 1985 hundreds of extras wait for that ten second shot. And in that harrowing and massive scale clash at the castle the foreshadowed storm finally enters the film and serenades the massacre. It is a magnificent battle scene with many things happening. Kurosawa chose to construct the entire third castle against a muddy hill and places his soldiers against the grimy backdrop intensifying the colours emblazoned onto their uniform which signal their allegiance. His multicam coverage is never more evident here placing cameras inside the battle itself and cutting judiciously to reveal horror after horror a corpse being trampled by galloping horse a solider struggling amongst the lifeless bodies of his comrades another clutching his dismembered limb and that magnificent shot of a crazy Hidetora stumbling into the midst of the battlefield while red and yellow sides watch him intently and the remains of a great castle burn from above. The cameras seldom dolly in Ran they tilt and pan to reveal the action from a objective omniscient view. There are sparse use of closeups. As Ebert says we are like gods witnessing these atrocities of unfathomable nature. The Western orchestration punctuates Takemitsu's Eastern score Kurosawa's divergence from tradition makes it all the more horrifying. Hidetora's ornate costume changes into rags and his face becomes ghostly in his anguish and madness deep gashes and burned eyes the Noh influence stylising his masklike Shiwajo as the weary old man wandering and contemplating his sins. Harada's Lady Kaede is another character of Noh influence. Observe how precise and elegantly she shuffles into the room uses pointed questions to direct Kurogane to murder for her before shutting him out. She drifts down onto the ground crosslegged silent but so evidently displaying her sexual hold over Jiro. She explodes in emotion the insane cackles as she seduces Jiro closing each shoji one by one and in that final moment where she confesses her vengeance and true motive. How long has she held Hidetora's atrocities in her mind? Kurosawa visualises her end in a sudden release of anger and bloodlust no gore but a painterly splash of blood on the back wall. A stark and powerful image. Shakespeare's play is perhaps not as focused as Ran is with its multiple story lines and scattered soliloquies. Kurosawa's screen adaptation conjures images of sheer scale and horror like no theatre stage could. In that final scene a blind Tsurumaru wanders and drops the image of Buddha into irrecoverable ruins. The gods have abandoned all sympathy. The camera paints a picture he will never see a tiny helpless figure dead centre in a desolate hellish world near sunset. Weren't we hunting boar in the idyllic bright hills just moments ago? How finite power is and how even swifter seized power is lost.".

Over 1400 extras were used and a suit of armor had to be made for each. Some 200 horses were used. The stunts also are amazing... there had to be some bones broken when you see these guys falling off their horses at a full run. There's another scene where an infantry soldier tries to get out of the way of a cavalryman thundering toward him and the horse's breast hits him full in the chest sending him flying.There a really memorable scene where Kurosawa has built a 1.5M replica of a castle and burns it to the ground. The sight of the castle fully engulfed and Hidetora walking down the steps in his descent toward madness has to be one of the best alltime film scenes.My only criticism is the length  it lags a couple of times.

	schema:reviewBody "Review in one sentence This movie has zero energy. What follows is my fragmented chronological lambasting of this masterpiece. The characters are cardboard cutouts with very little in terms of actual development. The opening scene begins with an argument between Hidetora and his three sons. It's almost like it assumes retroactive character maturity that was never established to begin with. It would have been nice to see some color in terms of personality with each of these three key players given some screen time before the big fallout. In the seemingly endless line of miscalculations made on the part of our favorite masterful filmmaker Akira Kurosawa AK decides to provide his kind of color  vague oneliners. The pranks of the third son are referenced but we get no actual development of his character he does have one good moment later on. As for the other two sons we don't even get AK's fuzzy caricatures. This viewer was left wholly indifferent by all of these sons and their opaque motivations didn't help matters.Even worse is the portrayal of the vitally important fifth character. In AK's infinite stupidity he chooses to have the key puppetmaster Lady Kaede simply state that her father and brothers were murdered by Hidetora and that her mother committed suicide. There is ample opportunity for a flashback or a lengthy opening historical segment that actually fleshes out her character while allowing the viewer to experience her sorrows directly but AK simply settles for dull monologue by a onedimensional personality. At one point early in the film she's sitting down and simply states that she's happy to be living in her old residence again. It's an utterly robotic emotionless tedious series of statements that are boring as hell. Only AK could portray vengeance in a manner this dull.We get the first battle and see a bunch of generic guys killing each other with no reason to care who actually wins. Some women that we don't know kill themselves along the way. There are some decent visuals though. Not bad but not exactly scintillating.After the battle we get some of the vintage overacting that shows up in most of AK's films. Hidetora goes crazy and frolics in the grasslands. When his two buddies show up to comfort him he stares into space opens his mouth as wide as a Pez dispenser and has a hissy fit while his jester runs around singing. It's a total disaster of dramaticism. But that's not all. Hidetora's buddies carry him to some random shack only to learn that the resident just so happens to be a dude that got his eyes gauged out by Hidetora years ago. Impractical coincidence alert! So what does this blind dude do to the man who handicapped him for life? Does he curse him? Does he lunge at him with a knife? No. He plays a sad flute song. Hidetora then promptly throws himself through a wall. Such a masterful filmmaker AK is.We go back to Lady Kaede who magically goes from stoic carelessness to knifewielding lunatic in 5 seconds flat then takes another turn to hysterical crocodile tears only a few minutes later. Hey AK that flashback would have been REALLY helpful. And do you know what else would have been helpful? A little relationship development between Kaede and the two sons to help the viewer in understanding exactly why these powerful men are wrapped around her little finger. You did have 160 minutes to use here. Why not use them properly for a change? Over 90 minutes in and we finally get a wellwritten moment when a stone foxhead is returned to Lady Kaede. Then again even a broken clock is right twice a day. Of course AK immediately follows this brief success with another laughable attempt at manipulation. The blind dude and his sister who has become a target for assassination are escorted to safety. His sister spots an old castle and tells him about it. He asks where it is. Now any thoughtful sister would give her blind brother some idea of where this castle is. Perhaps she could take his hand and point it in the right direction. Unfortunately this is one of those masterful Akira Kurosawa movies so she simply blurts out Over there! The blind dude turns to the right turns to the left and asks Where? Some sad music accompanies this hopelessly incompetent scene where AK so blatantly reminds the viewer that  yes  the blind dude is in fact BLIND! Good ole AK wanted the viewer to feel sorry for the blind dude so he constructs this ridiculous scene to pile it on. I laughed. The direction here is so terribly amateurish that only fanboys could possibly deny AK's clumsy incompetence.Hidetora gets amnesia and babbles senselessly. Stuff like Who am I? and I'm lost. Such is the human condition replies the jester. Give me a break. In a truly hilarious moment the jester tells Hidetora to simply jump off a cliff if he's so disturbed about everything. Hidetora promptly jumps off a cliff. I laughed. Later on Hidetora suddenly remembers that he has three sons. I'm serious.We get the final battle which is pathetic. First of all the blue samurai army somehow gets their hands on some semiautomatic rifles. What on earth are semiautomatic rifles doing in this period piece? Next the editing is atrocious. The sequence is so badly cut up that one wonders if a young Paul Greengrass was hired as the action director. Third the battle strategies suck. The red army rides around in circles while the blue army shoots them down. Not good.AK finishes things off with his patented overdramaticism. Hidetora even goes so far as to say  out loud no less  Things are getting dark. Wow. Just wow.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie came as a big disappointment to me. I really adore Japanese culture and history and I am a big fan of Asian cinema. I was looking forward to see a film that is considered as a masterpiece by many and has risen to world wide fame.I was surprised to see so many flaws in this film that I don't even know where to start. First of all the movie is far too long and lacks of fluidity. The story is extremely predictable and develops no tension at all. The script is very poor and unoriginal. It steals several ideas from many other theatre plays and movies. One always feels that one has seen the same story elsewhere before and in a much better way. The beginning is overlong and should have been shortened. The middle part with the scenes in the field and the destroyed castle include many lengths. The ending is not well told and finishes too abruptly on the other side.The battle scenes are a complete fail. We see a shot of soldiers shooting in a forest. In the next shot we see five soldiers yelling and falling from the horses to die on the ground. Repeat the two shots five times and this is what the battle scenes of this movie are like. There is no action no aesthetic and no emotion in those scenes. It rather looks like a chess game than a true battle.The dialogues are amongst the poorest ones I have ever witnessed in cinema and I have seen thousand of movies. They are extremely wooden and sometimes so ridiculous that I had to laugh out hard. The scenes including the arrogant philosophical and schizophrenic fool are annoying. When the old lord gets insane and just always says the same couple of sentences throughout the second half of the movie and shares many scenes with the fool the whole thing looks like a parody in form of an old fashioned theatre play for kids. Some intellectual people will now talk about the irony that the fool always tells the truth and switches roles with his master and that the poor old man saved the fool and that this action started all the intrigues but this is no excuse for so many poor and repetitive dialogues.The characters are not credible. The movie tries to include many hints at traditional Japanese culture but these elements are exaggerated and don't seem authentic at all to me. The role of the fool that insults everybody around him but stays extremely faithful to his old master once he has gone insane is ridiculous. A man that shows this kind of disrespect would have been executed in traditional Japan. A woman like Lady Kaede would have never been so successful with her predictable intrigues. Any credible husband or brotherinlaw would have given an order to execute her. The fact that Lady Sue could easily escape from the castle and go to her brother is not credible at all even if she got help. One would have followed and killed her and the traitor that refuses to obey his master and its sisterinlaw would have been executed too. It also seems strange to me that the lord's adviser finally kills Lady Kaede without getting the order by his superior while the lord stands next to him and doesn't react. I'm not an expert of Japanese history but from what I have seen from other movies read from several books known from history lessons and heard from Japanese that I could meet many of these scenes don't seem realistic to me at all if I think about the severe code of honour of this country.After so many negative aspects let's mention some positive things. Even though the characters aren't credible and the dialogues are wooden it's not the mistake by the actors but by the writer and director. The acting itself is well executed and should be praised. It's the only thing that kept me watching this flick until the end. To give you an example the interpretation of Lady Kaede or the annoying fool are well done from an objective point of view.At the time of its creation this movie was Japan's most expensive production ever. Akira Korusawa was a big name and he got some good connections. You can see this by the inclusion of many supportive actors excellent settings and especially many valuable costumes that are created with much detail. The film is quite colourful and beautiful to watch. Only the camera cuts are stiff and some potential is wasted there.Concerning the story even though the whole thing is predictable some of the intrigues are still well done. After a weak start and before a weaker second half of the movie we have around fortyfive minutes or so that are really entertaining and have some plot development. This is the strongest part of the movie.In the end there are some positive points to mention but the weaker ones are in majority. It's definitely not the mistake of the costume makers the actors or the light and sound engineers that do an almost flawless job. It's the fault of the poor writers and the headless director. Shame on you Mister Akira Korusawa. Even a big name can't save this film that must be considered as a failure at the highest level. It's not the worst thing I have seen but still below average. I definitely don't recommend this movie to anybody apart of fans of gorgeous costumes and old fashioned theatre plays.".

I was looking forward to see a film that is considered as a masterpiece by many and has risen to world wide fame.I was surprised to see so many flaws in this film that I don't even know where to start. First of all the movie is far too long and lacks of fluidity. The story is extremely predictable and develops no tension at all. The script is very poor and unoriginal.

	schema:reviewBody "Typically comingofage stories unfold in a predictable fashion kid tentatively ventures into the world beyond the one he knows where he encounters people and things that will change him and his outlook on life forever. It would be easy to dismiss Kill Your Darlings as yet another entry in a tired genre the tale of a poet who finds his voice through a heady cocktail of sex drugs and college. But John Krokidas' debut feature film which takes as its subjects the American poets of the revolutionary Beat Generation fits in so much more as it explores a haunting search for life and legacy that teeters close to the edge of death.Allen Ginsberg Daniel Radcliffe arrives at Columbia University keen to start a life away from the shadow of his famous dad poet Louis Ginsberg David Cross and his mentally unstable mother Jennifer Jason Leigh. He meets the electrifying Lucien Carr Dane DeHaan a rebel radiating so much charisma and ambition that it's easy to forget his lack of actual talent. Lucien brings together the aspiring artists who will soon come to change the literary world with their words Allen William S. Burroughs Ben Foster and Jack Kerouac Jack Huston. As their lives intersect their destinies intertwine tangled up in the form of David Kammerer Michael C. Hall a man hopelessly caught in Lucien's enthralling spell.Krokidas keeps this fascinating brew of hormones hope and horror bubbling throughout effectively nailing the champagne fizz of youth a time when you could do ridiculous things and remember them as romantic and revolutionary. Allen yearns Jack drinks William sucks nitrous oxide into his lungs in a bathtub and Lucien keeps them all spinning. You don't have to know the Beat poets or their work to recognise the fire burning in these young men. Slicing and dicing pages of old classics the boys make their manifesto quite literal they will not rely on or succumb to tradition their work will be conscribed by neither rhyme nor meter.The most intriguing thing about Kill Your Darlings is that it refuses to romanticise this budding intellectual movement. The Beat poets may have become the idols of literary hipsters everywhere but Krokidas takes care to tuck their ingenuity and creativity into the recognisable rhythms of everyday life. Desperate to hang onto Lucien's interest Allen practically stumbles into his own talent. To create magic he jerks off in front of his typewriter or stupidly ties a noose around his neck to come a little closer to death. These young men Krokidas seems to be saying are treading a fine line between inspiration and tomfoolery. It's only when Allen recites a poem  on a moonlit night on a stolen boat  that Lucien is comprehensively struck by his genius as are we.When the film spins into darker more murderous territory it moves from comingofage story to crime thriller  a genre shift that oddly works quite well within the universe established by Krokidas as it allows Allen to contemplate the darker less palatable side of Lucien's volatile personality. But it also becomes that much harder to separate the facts of these characters from Krokidas' fiction. David's tragic obsession with Lucien  one that the film suggests Allen could have shared  finally kicks off a tragic twist of events that unfold in a very particular way in Kill Your Darlings. Arguably Allen ends up in an emotional place in the film that doesn't quite sit right with what actually transpired in real life as told to us by a series of title cards just before the end credits.Less controversial is the young cast all of whom do firstrate work in disentangling the complex web of relationships that exists amongst these characters. Radcliffe is still a mite stiff as an actor but this is his best onscreen performance yet brave bold and proof that he's willing to challenge anyone's ideas of what he can do on screen. DeHaan is a firecracker as the capricious Lucien burning so brightly that it's no wonder the other characters can't tear themselves away from him. Hall gets to sound a note of quiet desolation as David whose infatuation isn't played simply as the unrequited lust of a madman. Only Elizabeth Olsen  as Jack's longsuffering girlfriend  is called upon to play a stereotype.All in all Kill Your Darlings marks an impressive debut for Krokidas. Shaken and stirred with a gloriously jazzy soundtrack and a colour palette that shifts from light to murky in a heartbeat the film practically radiates tension both sexual and intellectual. It might have a little trouble with the facts of the matter but taken on its own merits this is a smart intoxicating look at how adolescent dreams must necessarily give way to the chilling bite of reality.".

	schema:reviewBody "A little over an hourandahalf but seems much longer. Little to no conflict one can care about  Kammerer just pops in and out of the narrative which can't sustain any sense of tension between him and Carr or Ginsberg. The central figures of Burroughs Ginsberg Kerouac and Carr come across as shallow and selfabsorbed. Perhaps at that young age they were but that doesn't make for compelling drama. And the montage surrounding the murder with its heavyhanded penetration imagery is so overthetop obvious to be almost ridiculous. The cinematography is just ugly  I realize the lighting color palette etc. were deliberate artistic choices but it still looks unappealing. The actors do a good job with what they are given Foster as Burroughs is especially good capturing his cadence inflection and mannerisms without descending into mimicry but overall the film is unfocused slack and unpleasant.".

The central figures of Burroughs Ginsberg Kerouac and Carr come across as shallow and selfabsorbed. Perhaps at that young age they were but that doesn't make for compelling drama. And the montage surrounding the murder with its heavyhanded penetration imagery is so overthetop obvious to be almost ridiculous. The cinematography is just ugly  I realize the lighting color palette etc. were deliberate artistic choices but it still looks unappealing. The actors do a good job with what they are given Foster as Burroughs is especially good capturing his cadence inflection and mannerisms without descending into mimicry but overall the film is unfocused slack and unpleasant.";

The film starts off very promisingly depicting Ginsberg's early life at home in Paterson New Jersey and his subsequent career at Columbia University.

The 'official' view as propounded by Professor Stevens John Cullum seems stuffy and oldfashioned.

Matters are not helped by Radcliffe's rather colorless performance as Ginsberg  his expressions rarely change from being rather bemused as what's happening around him. A brave attempt at recreating the values of a previous generation but the director seems to lose the courage of his convictions.".

This isn't it.Kill Your Darlings 2013 is a biographical drama about the early adult years of the beat generation stalwarts Allen Ginsburg 192697 Jack Kerouac 192269 and William Burroughs 191497. For those of you who don't know the details Ginsburg achieved much acclaim for his literary works including a National Book Award for The Fall of America 1974 and a Pulitzer Prize nomination for Poems 19861992 1995. He was famous for his support of homosexuality and his opposition to the Vietnam War. Kerouac is most famous for his classic On The Road 1951 and his later Big Sur 1962. Burroughs was a prolific author Junkie Naked Lunch whose themes of death drugs and homosexuality can be seen in their beginning phases in this film.The whole idea of the beat generation was that if you could dismantle the structure of communication and still have some worth then anything was up for grabs. If poetry could give up rhyme and still have substance then sex could give up its hetero prefix and still have love and society could give up its mores and still find order. To such a message the dull and plodding structure of standard film school does no homage. Nor do the film makers even seem aware of the message of the beat generation putting in scenes of jazz sex drugs and English class without seeming to understand their interrelationships.There is a great story to be told about the beat generation.

	schema:reviewBody "Another lover hits the universe. The circle is broken. But with death comes rebirth. And like all lovers and sad people I am a poet.I knew nothing about Kill Your Darlings going into this movie which means I basically don't know anything about modern American literature because apparently these guys were famous poets that influenced their generation during the 50's with their literary work. Known today as the Beat generation they basically rejected the moral standards imposed at the time and innovated in style while experimenting with drugs and sex. Many films based on their work have been adapted for for the big screen Howl On the Road and Naked Lunch but I haven't seen them so I actually went into this film without knowing anything about these writers. The film serves as an introduction as to how these writers came together and influenced one another during their teenage years and it is told from Allen Ginsberg's point of view. This biographical dramathriller may not be entirely factual but it is still a fascinating story and once the film ended it made me want to know about who these people were. The film's main attraction is the excellent chemistry between Daniel Radcliffe and Dane DeHaan who give excellent performances and after a while you actually forget Radcliffe is Harry Potter. The supporting cast is also strong including Michael C. Hall Ben Foster and Jack Huston. I'm a huge fan of Elizabeth Olsen but in this film her character wasn't given much to work with but it makes sense considering the Beat generation is a male dominated movement. It ended up influencing the hippie movement in the 60's and popular rock bands like The Beatles. This film only focuses on the early stages of their lives but it shows how these artists came to know each other and how Lucien Carr was the most influential figure in their formation.The screenplay was cowritten by director John Krokidas and Austin Bunn focusing on the early stages of Alan Ginsberg's Daniel Radcliffe life as he began studying at Columbia University which shaped his philosophical views on life. The turning point in his life was when he met his classmate Lucien Carr Dane DeHaan who taught him to question the orthodox methods of the school and introduced him to other future icons of the Beat generation William S. Burroughs Ben Foster and Jack Kerouac Jack Huston. Together they would hang out in night clubs exploring new literary ideas and basically rediscovering themselves. They were against moral boundaries and explored with drugs and sex. Alan and some of the others also dealt with their homosexuality while some tried to hide it. Lu also introduced Alan to one of his mentors David Krammerer Michal C. Hall who was obsessed with Lu and ultimately led to a tragic event. The film succeeds mostly because of the great performances from the young cast and because it is actually an intriguing story. John Krokidas isn't a director I was familiar with but he does a decent job with this film. The film does have a believable 40's style and it stays true to the period. It is really well paced as well and it begins to get more interesting once the crime takes place. Unfortunately the film does lack some structure and at times I felt like it was wandering off. The scenes with Allen's mother never were explored much but we understand how it affected his life and his relationship with his father. The characters are sometimes a bit too clever and don't feel real at times. Still I was engaged with this film thanks to the material which is very interesting and I enjoyed the performances very much. The film is ambiguous at times but that is what will leave you thinking and wanting to learn more about these characters at the end. It is all over the place at times but I was drawn in to the story and for a biopic it gets the job done.".

	schema:reviewBody "My review of Kill Your Darlings may be heavily bias because I have read everything I can get my hands on about the relationship between Ginsberg and Carr and I am a beat fan before almost many things. However this film examines Ginsberg Daniel Radcliffe before he began his literary revolution and the character is one I found easy to fall in love with. Radcliffe portrays Ginsberg  with the aid of new comer writer and director John Korkidas  with a playful naive innocence as he approaches love and friendship at Columbia and his relationship between Carr Dane DeHaan is believable from the moment you see them in the same scene. There is an obvious chemistry between DeHaan and Radcliffe that really aids the performance. I have seen this film twice now and upon reflection I enjoyed how the sexuality of the characters was not places heavily on screen despite the homosexuality of Ginsberg being a very key aspect of the films script. The sexual tension between Ginsberg and Carr was handled very well and I was never not intrigued by the compelling dynamic between the two and if anything by the end of the film was more curious about the relationship than I was when I walked into the theater. Jack Huston and Ben Foster give amazing performances despite their lack of character development throughout the film but they never took all of the attention either which I especially enjoyed as it was never a film about just Ginsberg or a film about Kerouac alone as it was about all of the beat writers and the event that begun their revolution as inspirational writers. Micheal C Hall gives an incredible performance however I felt as though I could really see his character of Dexter in the T.V show of the same title shine through his portrayal of Kammerer. This similarity did not hinder the film as a whole but in one particular scene I felt as though I was watching Dexter not Kammerer. The main theme of the movie revolves around 'A Vision' by William Butler Yeats and his idea of life being circular carries deep within viewers as they watch Ginsberg's life 'widen'. This film is a must see for any of you who love the beats or those of you who are inspired by indie films about deeply buried tales.".

I am a homosexual and I did enjoy this one tremendously. Not in so many films that homosexuality serves only as an undertone despite some visualized images of homosexual lovemaking. Absolute love of freedom becomes the overriding theme of this bunch of homosexual artists. I think this film will get all of us closer to a natural treatment of the third sex. Homosexuals would be equaled to heterosexuals when their issue ceases to be an issue for the public at large. The film is not trying to tell the whole story of these artists. Just a very thin slice was chosen to be told and what a slice it was. My country Thailand is still stuck with the 18th Century superhuman theory of politics. All moral codes are determined by how much you love and glorify the king. Nothing else really matters. Even a murder is construed by law as being better than libeling the king his family members and his men. So I understand how it feels to be so free and be met with ultraconservatism at times. Madness can come as a result of being free but the lack of it would drive you insane. Quite a different of psychological episodes. I encourage you to watch this film and do more research about these characters. You will end up knowing a lot more about yourself.".

Much like the work of Lewis Carroll drugs alcohol and culture were catalysts towards the ideology of destroying the old and building the new. The movement itself was a rousing feat with great cultural ramifications. The film itself is a work that sometimes trades in the grainy for flashy rupturing not only the pattern that the authors were trying to break but the whole tone of the film as well.If I pitched you a story about the Beat generation led by Harry Potter the new Harry Osborne a guy from XMen and the guy from Boardwalk Empire with half his face missing I'm sure the reaction would be pretty great. Unfortunately for audiences the subject matter submits to a truly unauthentic lack lustre festival formula and abandons creativeness and a unique vision for a familiar narrative that disregards great historical figures making them caricatures within a lame murdermystery genre film.Daniel Radcliffe plays Allen Ginsberg one of the most famous and recognizable poets in the American culture. Radcliffe continues to shed his 'Hogwarts alumni' image by taking risky unconventional and edgy roles that all share in their seemingly controversial nature. Upon his acceptance and arrival into Columbia University Ginsberg is in search of something offbeat. Ironically enough Ginsberg is lured into the residency of Lucien Carr Dane DeHaan an intoxicated sociopath with an obsession for selfdestruction always curious for the taste of the complicated and unexplainable.Together Carr and Ginsberg start a small revolution in their heads but without so many words. With the help of an unlimited supply of cannabis and some Johnny Walker the two eventually enlist of the help of William Burroughs Ben Foster and a young Jack Kerouac Jack Huston and begin their uprising. Through constant disruptions by the reputation and prestige Columbia University holds so true and dear to its heart the constantly stoned literary bandits are engulfed into a world of lovers obsession and murder intent on revolutionizing literature.Kill Your Darlings starts bold and overwhelming demanding utmost attention. Unfortunately once attention is given the film cannot hold its grip and deliver a rousing culturally relevant story about some of the most influential figures in contemporary literature in the last century. Blending the lines of drug induced fantasy and reality Kill Your Darlings is a story of breaking the formulaic path distrusting all conventional and predictable beats of rhyme and meter but sadly becomes a textbook festival entry with a forgettable conclusion.The term to 'kill your darlings' is one that suggests destroying all the conventions and comforts of the mundane reinventing yourself and throwing inhibition to the wind and finding creativity will inspire instances of utter uniqueness. Kill Your Darlings although sometimes confident is an obsessive and complicated retelling of enigmatic characters placed in a deceitful and overdramatized tragedy of murder. With the rich historical and cultural imprint of these feisty literary pioneers so much of the busy murder antics is clearly overshadowing the brilliant opportunity to showcase the likes of Carr Ginsberg Burroughs and Kerouac.Mixing the potential monologue moments of Weir's 1989 Dead Poets Society with the tone and ambiance of Salle's 2004 masterpiece The Motorcycle Diaries Kill Your Darlings becomes a self inflicted suicide of a film with a tantalizing and promising narrative. Don't get me wrong the performances are top notch DeHaan is magnificent as Carr and Radcliffe is radiant as Ginsberg. However while most of the topbilled cast is ravishing and supporting cast is spot on the film feels drowned in the water with average narrative clichs weighing it down.While the antics of the underbelly of the New York Greenwich Village scene have been explored battered bruised and forever changed by the provocative and decadent Beat Movement Kill Your Darlings remains a tame snippet of the life of these amazing authors and thinkers. Destined to be an example of a complicated festival biography attempt the film will positively spark deep discussion. Kill Your Darlings repeats the initial reaction to Carr's response to Ginsberg's complicated life Perfect. I love complicated. Hopefully next time an autobiographical cinematic take on the origins of the Beat Generation will be less gimmicky and more focused on the howling affect these fascinating individuals had on the world of literature art and our contemporary culture as a whole.".

With the rich historical and cultural imprint of these feisty literary pioneers so much of the busy murder antics is clearly overshadowing the brilliant opportunity to showcase the likes of Carr Ginsberg Burroughs and Kerouac.Mixing the potential monologue moments of Weir's 1989 Dead Poets Society with the tone and ambiance of Salle's 2004 masterpiece The Motorcycle Diaries Kill Your Darlings becomes a self inflicted suicide of a film with a tantalizing and promising narrative. Don't get me wrong the performances are top notch DeHaan is magnificent as Carr and Radcliffe is radiant as Ginsberg. However while most of the topbilled cast is ravishing and supporting cast is spot on the film feels drowned in the water with average narrative clichs weighing it down.While the antics of the underbelly of the New York Greenwich Village scene have been explored battered bruised and forever changed by the provocative and decadent Beat Movement Kill Your Darlings remains a tame snippet of the life of these amazing authors and thinkers. Destined to be an example of a complicated festival biography attempt the film will positively spark deep discussion. Kill Your Darlings repeats the initial reaction to Carr's response to Ginsberg's complicated life Perfect. I love complicated. Hopefully next time an autobiographical cinematic take on the origins of the Beat Generation will be less gimmicky and more focused on the howling affect these fascinating individuals had on the world of literature art and our contemporary culture as a whole.";

	schema:reviewBody "Director and cowriter with Austin Bunn John Krokidas have created an atmospheric visit to the beginnings of one of literary history's great movements  the Beat Generation  and in doing so have carved a fine story that combines not only the rise of the Beats but also examines the slow emergence of recognition of sexual identity crises in both a positive and a critical manner. Cast with a group of very fine actors and accompanied with musical director Nico Muhly's sensitive score that includes the references to Brahms symphonies and trios and transcriptions of themes along with terrific excerpts from Harlem's jazz scene courtesy of Dawn Newman as a jazz singer this film is successful on many levels not the least of which is the reminder of the permanent impact on American literature and sociology imprinted by the likes of Allen Ginsberg Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs. The very sensitive opening sequence appreciated only at film's end sets the dark tone of the film and opens the window to understanding the Beats also called the Libertine Circle by Ginsberg.The time is the mid 1940s and Allen Ginsberg Daniel Radcliff is an English major in Columbia University assigned to be the roommate of Lucien 'Make me cry or make me horny' Carr Dane DeHann who awakens Ginsberg's rebellious self and introduces him to the work of Rimbaud. Dissatisfied by the orthodox attitudes of the school Ginsberg finds himself drawn to iconoclastic colleagues like the egotistical but genius Lucien Carr William S. Burroughs Ben Foster and Jack Kerouac Jack Huston. Together this gang would explore bold new literary ideas that would challenge Columbia University's staid stance and the sensibilities of their time as the future Beat Generation. However for all their creativity their very appetites and choices lead to more serious transgressions that would mark their lives forever. Lucien has been stalked since age 14 by the older gay David Kammerer Michael C. Hall who sees Lucien as his lover but in this version of the story Lucien acted out his same sex proclivities with both Ginsberg and Kerouac. Lucien murders Kammerer and drags his body into the Hudson River recall the opening scene of the film and it is the advice of both Kerouac and Burroughs that leads to the judgment of the questionable verdict. Ginsberg goes on to create 'Howl' and Kerouac moves toward 'On the Road' and Carr becomes a journalist. Despite the at times confusing dichotomy between the murder story and the literary awakening the Beats introduced this is a fascinating depiction of a movement of enormous impact. John Krokidas captures all the essence of the times in the 1940s New York City and his actors  especially Daniel Radcliff  bring this story to life. There is an uncredited role of Lucien Carr's mother superbly played by Kyra Sedgwick and any number of other fleeting bit parts that add to the mystique of the period. Recommended on many levels.".

But Lucien's personal imbroglio with his fervent lover David Kammerer C. Hall a professorturnedjanitor makes everything complicated and eventually the reallife event changes their life path forever. It is director John Krokidas' powerful feature debut affluently submerged into the zeitgeist of the time with the alluring soundtrack and frenetic editing right on the ball it is enthralling for most of its screening time! But a sticky problem is the brazen depiction of the drugdependent inducement for inspiration and other crazy stuff such as asphyxiation attempt although it is not a hagiography but the impact strikes rather strong and it is too real to overlook. Basically it is a straightforward story man A is in love with man B who selfishly considers himself is out of A's league moreover there is a third man C is blindly obsessed with B eventually a destructive denouement is a wakeup call for A so he can withdraw from a nogoodending infatuation and learn his lesson in a hard way. Redcliffe shows off his bent to immerse himself into a diversely challenging adult role and manage to unleash a manifesto declares that the most successful child star of our time is going to be a versatile thespians. As great as Redcliffe the MVP here undeniably is DeHaan whose unconventional charisma is lethally seductive but beguilingly hazardous in the film he is a merciless and contemptible egomaniac a capricious manipulator and a doted kid who is rebelling against the formality but inside is wanting real talent as he revealingly confesses he is only an instigator who can proffer vision for great minds which he can keenly detect that's why Ginsberg Kerouac and Burroughs can all be together in one room he is the magnet the glue the acute discernment is his expertise DeHaan exerts an extraordinary ambiguity into his reasons and actions even in his cruelest scenes we see devil on screen disguised with an innocent mask. A stellar supporting cast including Cross and Jason Leigh as Allen's parents a poet and his mad wife Rasche is the rhetoric dean and Cullum is the established professor with a twist of unexpected sagacity in the coda Kyra Sedgwick is uncredited as Lucien's mother. Huston and Olsen make a bickering couple before Kerouac sails for his ON THE ROAD journey but both underutilized. Michael C. Hall is heartbreakingly poignant in the critical stabbing replay although his character is the biggest flaw in the plot completely onenote and corny he should have been more than a fool in love. Actually the unassuming and unheralded hero is Ben Foster who is so good in dissolving himself into his character his William Burroughs is never showy he is a slowburner it is a great mimicry to say the least one can hardly sense any trace of Foster's own personality in it he is consistently excellent and overtly the best among his peers a true chameleon is waiting for his moment to shine!Both DeHaan and Foster sneak into my yearend top 10 performances DeHaan occupies the bronze presently while Redcliffe misses the rank by just a notch it is a difficult movie for Harry Potter devotees. As a firsttimer Krokidas accomplishes a pretty impressive debut certainly deserves a spot on the watchlist of newdirectorsonthehorizon.".

I enjoy movies that depict a fascinating bit of history that has somehow gone by unnoticed. The main character in this movie is Allen Ginsberg Daniel Radcliffe but the movie revolved around Lucien Carr Dane DeHaan. The plot zeroes in on the crime that played such a big role in their lives and in some of their books.However this movie is really about capturing the zeitgeist and personalities of these largerthanlife figures. For this group Columbia University from 1943 to 1945 was a time and place where poetry and literature mattered. Really REALLY mattered. What I liked in particular was how the film sidestepped all the usual movie conventions about what society was like during the war and shines a spotlight instead on the drugsoaked world of these people. Many movies about the 1940s look rather modern but this movie shows us a strange 1940s New York that seems a world away.This movie is about not much more than a group of gay party kids who have grand antiestablishment notions but are seriously into drugs and get into serious trouble. However the movie has the deliberate pace self awareness seriousness elegiac feel and earnest acting that come with an homage. I'm not knocking the scene at all but I halfexpected religious music to well up when Allen has sex for the first time. The homosexuality was dealt with well in the movie. It's nice to see honest historical depictions of this. Part of the movie is the story of Ginsberg's sexual awakening. Of course I'm also wondering why we need another movie about gays who commit crimes attempt suicide and are unstable and generally unhappy. The movie makes the point that one of the real tragedies here is homophobia David's murder and how easily Lu got off and how Lu spent the rest of his life in the closet.There is a message about love in there reflected in the title. With one or two exceptions I thought the movie was well acted but I'm not sure about the casting. For one thing the actors were too old. Also it was a little difficult to see why everyone was falling for sleeping with or otherwise hanging out with Lu.This is an interesting historical drama. I suspect I would have enjoyed it more if I had ever read any of these writers. I'm afraid that it's still not clear to me why I should. Poetry and literature have its place but do they really matter anymore given the onslaught of visual media and information? Perhaps that's another point of the film. The world has changed so much in seven decades. Why do these minor figures matter? I suppose there is a direct connection between this young men and the blossoming and liberalisation that took place in the 1960s and 1970s. I'm just speculating though.".

	schema:headline " Oddly bloodless but some might well like it";
	schema:reviewBody "The best thought this is 'absolutely amazing' and the worst that 'on so many different levels this movie is stupendously awful'. Actually it is  in my view at least  neither. The thought occurs to me that for whatever reason the sum of the parts don't quite add up to a whole. Kill Your Darlings is oddly bloodless and bland which is something of an irony given that it ends with the stabbing and drowning of one of the characters.Part of the problem for John Krokidas is that one of the central elements of his piece the Beat Generation and its various protagonists  including Jack Kerouac Allen Ginsburg and William Burroughs  are of rather less consequence in the second decade of 21st century than many not least the Beat Generation would like. OK so they caused something of a stir in the Fifties and kicked over the traces in a safe Western world which preferred domesticity and calm after the torrid time of World War II but quite soon the real next generation came along the baby boomers grabbing far more attention and rather tactlessly shuffling the Beats offstage.Then there is the work of the Beats. You might rate it but from what I have read it is all rather silly and trivial. Rebelling against contemporary conformity was their main interest  when is it not for a young generation?  but the poems and prose pieces  or at least those Krokidas chose to include in his film  are pretty trivial silly and often quite bad. Truman Capote who could write dismissed On The Road Kerouac's alleged masterpiece as 'that's not writing that's typing'. Read it or some of it then read some of Capote's work. I think you'll be inclined to agree with the little monster.The pieces of Ginsburg poetry we were presented with sound no more significant than all other trite juvenilia I've come across including my own.

	onyx:emotionText "The best thought this is 'absolutely amazing' and the worst that 'on so many different levels this movie is stupendously awful'. Actually it is  in my view at least  neither. The thought occurs to me that for whatever reason the sum of the parts don't quite add up to a whole. Kill Your Darlings is oddly bloodless and bland which is something of an irony given that it ends with the stabbing and drowning of one of the characters.Part of the problem for John Krokidas is that one of the central elements of his piece the Beat Generation and its various protagonists  including Jack Kerouac Allen Ginsburg and William Burroughs  are of rather less consequence in the second decade of 21st century than many not least the Beat Generation would like. OK so they caused something of a stir in the Fifties and kicked over the traces in a safe Western world which preferred domesticity and calm after the torrid time of World War II but quite soon the real next generation came along the baby boomers grabbing far more attention and rather tactlessly shuffling the Beats offstage.Then there is the work of the Beats. You might rate it but from what I have read it is all rather silly and trivial. Rebelling against contemporary conformity was their main interest  when is it not for a young generation?  but the poems and prose pieces  or at least those Krokidas chose to include in his film  are pretty trivial silly and often quite bad. Truman Capote who could write dismissed On The Road Kerouac's alleged masterpiece as 'that's not writing that's typing'. Read it or some of it then read some of Capote's work. I think you'll be inclined to agree with the little monster.The pieces of Ginsburg poetry we were presented with sound no more significant than all other trite juvenilia I've come across including my own. It's one thing to stick out your tongue at your elders pulls faces and proclaim you are different but quite another to leave behind a body of work of real substance.So Krokidas had  has  problem. Anther difficulty is that despite tremendous performances all round none of the characters is particularly likable. We don't really care about any of them except perhaps Ginsburg's mother.Amazing?

For a brief but scary moment I thought myself sitting in the wrong venue and dejavuing The Perks Of Being A Wallflower a movie highly praised all over but I hated it from the beginning to the very end. I remember that I wanted to walk out at that time but didn't for two reasons. One that I sat in the middle of a row in a fully booked venue. Second that I wondered the whole movie long what it could be that I overlooked knowing its high praises from various reputable sources. Luckily I soon realized that this movie Kill Your Darlings is completely different in spite of the fact that it also follows a university freshman and wouldbe writer. So from the outside my initial fear was justified.Back to the movie at hand Kill Your Darlings succeeded in keeping my attention for the full 104 minutes. The well known fact that writers and in particular poets are whimsical and change moods every other minute is showcased very well by the actors and the story gives them every chance to let us see that they can. It is not easy to tell where the plot is all about and I don't think it is useful to try anyway. Summarizing it can only do injustice to the complex shifting relationships between the main characters. Same injustice will result from throwing plot keywords for example poets alcohol sex betrayal and drugs. By the way one of the keywords on IMDb is also gay relationship a possible showstopper for some feeling uneasy watching gay sex but they can relax there is only one such scene it lasts one minute max and no male genitals are visible.All in all very good script and very well executed with believable casting and acting. After my initial dejavu fear that I was rewatching a movie that I grossly disliked at the time I enjoyed this one very much in spite of the dark understream and the unhappy ending. Maybe that someone having read or even studied the works of these famous writers finds many treasures in this movie that I unknowingly missed. I'm not familiar with their literature a fact of life that cannot be helped not being a native speaker of the English language in school we had to study other writers. For the audience award it ranked 21st with score 4.07 out of 5. I would not be surprised when others in the audience were unfamiliar with these writers too mostly nonnative English speakers just like me but the ultimate score clearly confirms their appreciation anyway for the movie that can stand on its own feet without needing to recognize the text quotes flying around.".

	schema:reviewBody "A film that was expected by many people because of an actor who were getting out of a teenage part that had lasted six or seven years like Daniel Radcliffe or an actor surviving a long series and his own cancer like Michael C. Hall. But as for me the main reason was the subject of that film the birth of the beat generation the meeting of the main protagonists of the beat generation to be and become. We are in 1943 and we meet young students at Columbia University in New York. They are all going to be the writers and poets of that post war lost generation that will beat their guilt out of their minds and beat us down into our own guilt.We all know Allen Ginsberg Jack Kerouac William Burroughs and Lucien Carr. It is true the fifth character of this pentacle David Kammerer is not really known for what he has achieved in his own life what he has left behind under his own name. He just was the English teacher who fell in love with his pupil Lucien Carr who fell in love too but as a teenager who had to grow out of this pubescent love and did not know how to do it especially since David Kammerer did not know he had to yield and step away. Instead of that he followed the young man and haunted him.Our four future poets and writers were all in breaking rules and experimenting all kinds of strange things drugs morphine alcohol of course marihuana but also the excitement and thrill they could get out of violating some good old standards in their society like sexual taboos and rejected sexual orientations. But they all had to break themselves to collide into one another and bruise hurt and even dismantle one another and themselves. It looks as if their future talent had to be born in the blood of a sacrificed innocent man whose sole crime was to love one of them excessively obsessively compulsively. That's the most dramatic and unexplainable fact in their lives and careers. They all needed that death to become. I just hope they were haunted by their guilt till the end of their own lives.Strangely enough their society was lenient even for the actual murderer and that can be explained easily by the fact that David Kammerer was gay and their society at the time was definitely and irredeemably antigay. Lucien Carr could have pleaded non guilty because David Kammerer being a homosexual he had the right to defend his honor and kill him. But Allan Ginsberg definitely and Jack Kerouac more or less not to speak of William Burroughs who was retrieved and taken away by his own father had to tell the truth in a way or another and to let everyone and Lucien Carr first of all know the truth Lucien Carr was in love with David Kammerer which made him a homosexual too. He thus had to accept the verdict of murder in the first degree. And yet he only got eighteen months of probationary detention. Quite cheap for the life of a man even a homosexual!But what remains the real truth for us is that these four poets and writers found their inspiration and force in those mixed orientations and in that crime described in all its ugliness discover the details in the film itself. And we are shown the horror twice plus told about it in full detail one third time along with the first visual demonstration. No way for us not to know the obsessive and compulsive obligation necessity impulse desire and even fascination to commit that murder to kill that man slowly and systematically as some kind of a last final commitment to each other till death them part and death inflicted by the young man to the older man does part them.We will say it is very romantic to find one's artistic inspiration in one's suffering but here that romanticism is sadistic since they find their inspiration in the suffering they inflict onto one another including onto an outsider who tries to stick to their small circle of . . . what can we call them? Friends? I doubt it.The film is packed with fast action rich piles of artifacts and props and the actors are all quite seasoned in their guilt and nonrepentance the nonrepentance of some crocodiles shedding tears on the suffering of others when they only shed tears on their own misery which is no misery at all since anyway they will be able to use their families or their connections to get through. The film does not in any way acclaim applaud and approve of this beat generation but it rather shows how they were lost because they were from more or less well off families they hated it but they used it skillfully in order to avoid punishment or to get a second chance. The only one who really did it with his own hands is Jack Kerouac but he was like the fifth wheel of a wagon the one who took part but did not really belong. But the film also contains some easy symbolism like showing William Burroughs shooting himself with morphine Allen Ginsberg being sexually penetrated by some unknown outsider he had accidentally picked in the street and Lucien Carr repeatedly stabbing David Kammerer. It is easy and it is also farfetched as if drug addiction gay sex and killing a gay partner were the same thing as if gay orientation led necessarily to anal sex shown on the screen a syringe in your arm and a knife in the chest of your lover the three at the same time and in close and dense succession. It even could sound like exposure more than fair presentation. Is the film ambiguous about this beat generation?Dr Jacques COULARDEAU".

Unlike the aforementioned documentary which briefly had dramatizations by Dennis Hopper Johnny Depp and John Turturro this new biopic is very much a movie. Mixing in romance familial impasses and even murder it's still designed to be based on a true story though the artistic license is questionably unrestrained.In 1943 young Allen Ginsberg Daniel Radcliffe of Paterson New Jersey is accepted into Columbia University in New York. In Professor Stevens' poetry class Allen speaks out against tradition and form praising Walt Whitman and his rulebreaking distaste for the fascist notions of meter and rhyme. He attracts the attention of Lucien Carr Dane DeHaan a fellow creative insurgent who introduces the impressionable Ginsberg to writer William Burroughs Ben Foster and former teacher David Kammerer Michael C. Hall. Infatuated with Carr's attitude they begin to form the blueprints for a new kind of progressive anarchical literature. When Lucien also recruits the influential and talented exmerchant marine Jack Kerouac Jack Huston Allen's disorienting romantic relationship with Carr is poised to fall apart.Despite the complicated relationships the conflicts the secrets and the controversial outmoded honor slaying defense routine the film still manages to paint uninteresting depictions of three revolutionary writers. It's as if a borderline inconsequential backstory led up to the maturation of artists whose professional lives would have been far more absorbing in cinematic representations. The audience isn't allowed to gain a sense of who they would become unless they're already familiar with their history. Revealing influences that would typically be immoderate including homosexuality in the '40s attempted suicide institutionalization for schizophrenia and finally manslaughter viewers only see rebellious or troubled youths struggling to survive adolescence  not the commencement of a radically different adoption of values spawned from the contempt of traditional social and political systems.In Kill Your Darlings successful artists can only be manufactured through trauma harrowing situations and derangement of the senses. All three hopeful poets imbibe smoke constantly and experiment with drugs real inspiration it seems must be orchestrated through hallucinogenic outofbody experiences. In an attempt to shatter expectations whether good or bad Ginsberg and his gang transform into rebels outcasts and pranksters. In the context of the picture it never leads to artistry  merely psychologically metamorphic activities that either try the patience or spill into overly sexually graphic territory that will abrasively pull audiences out of the fictionalization.There's far too little of the poetic dialogue that cleverly alludes to Ginsberg's later life and entirely too much intrusive jazz music to denote the time period. The editing is also a bore with its disoriented climax presented at the start before doubling back to play catchup. The casting with its vast assortment of leftover but recognizable character actors Michael C. Hall Ben Foster David Cross Jennifer Jason Leigh Elizabeth Olsen Kyra Sedgwick John Cullum provides minimal amusement but clearly its Daniel Radcliffe's film as he continues to seek out increasingly edgier roles. For this project however he's still the all too familiar bespectacled timid intellect trying futilely to be anything else.The Massie Twins GoneWithTheTwins.com".

He attracts the attention of Lucien Carr Dane DeHaan a fellow creative insurgent who introduces the impressionable Ginsberg to writer William Burroughs Ben Foster and former teacher David Kammerer Michael C. Hall. Infatuated with Carr's attitude they begin to form the blueprints for a new kind of progressive anarchical literature. When Lucien also recruits the influential and talented exmerchant marine Jack Kerouac Jack Huston Allen's disorienting romantic relationship with Carr is poised to fall apart.Despite the complicated relationships the conflicts the secrets and the controversial outmoded honor slaying defense routine the film still manages to paint uninteresting depictions of three revolutionary writers. It's as if a borderline inconsequential backstory led up to the maturation of artists whose professional lives would have been far more absorbing in cinematic representations. The audience isn't allowed to gain a sense of who they would become unless they're already familiar with their history. Revealing influences that would typically be immoderate including homosexuality in the '40s attempted suicide institutionalization for schizophrenia and finally manslaughter viewers only see rebellious or troubled youths struggling to survive adolescence  not the commencement of a radically different adoption of values spawned from the contempt of traditional social and political systems.In Kill Your Darlings successful artists can only be manufactured through trauma harrowing situations and derangement of the senses. All three hopeful poets imbibe smoke constantly and experiment with drugs real inspiration it seems must be orchestrated through hallucinogenic outofbody experiences. In an attempt to shatter expectations whether good or bad Ginsberg and his gang transform into rebels outcasts and pranksters. In the context of the picture it never leads to artistry  merely psychologically metamorphic activities that either try the patience or spill into overly sexually graphic territory that will abrasively pull audiences out of the fictionalization.There's far too little of the poetic dialogue that cleverly alludes to Ginsberg's later life and entirely too much intrusive jazz music to denote the time period. The editing is also a bore with its disoriented climax presented at the start before doubling back to play catchup. The casting with its vast assortment of leftover but recognizable character actors Michael C. Hall Ben Foster David Cross Jennifer Jason Leigh Elizabeth Olsen Kyra Sedgwick John Cullum provides minimal amusement but clearly its Daniel Radcliffe's film as he continues to seek out increasingly edgier roles. For this project however he's still the all too familiar bespectacled timid intellect trying futilely to be anything else.The Massie Twins GoneWithTheTwins.com";

The star of the proceedings however is clearly Davis.

	schema:reviewBody "Filmmaking at its best is what describes THE LITTLE FOXES directed by William Wyler shot by Gregg Toland  he of deep focus fame  adapted from a Lillian Hellman play and with Bette Davis playing a ruthless matriarch with a velvet glove.How far can greed take a person? This seems to be the question lingering over anyone who witnesses the story of the Hubbard's plot to secure money for a cotton mill they plan to run to expand their wealth even more. It's certainly a question that doesn't faze any of the Hubbard siblings  they need 75000 dollars to complete it and will get it one way or another  certainly not Regina Giddens who also intends to use her estranged husband's bonds for this purpose. That she effectively manipulates her daughter Alexandra into bringing him back to the house proves just what she can do to get what she wants and an easy proof is the way she lazily relaxes over the sofa regarding everything with semidroopy eyes knowing full well the extent of what she owns and that it won't take long for her to own even more. That even when he shows signs of failing health she doesn't back down  she will hound him for every penny he's got even if it means letting him die without his medication as she calmly does after a scene of verbal recriminations.A cruel story that never feels preachy THE LITTLE FOXES translates better on the screen than on the page much like THE CHILDREN'S HOUR much to the respect of those who admire Lillian Hellman's plays there are many flaws throughout that seem a little forced in either resolution or nonresolution. The film version goes much deeper in establishing the moral decay of a family while adding another  that of David Hewitt played by Richard Carlson  to give some contrast to the amount of unlikeable characters that populate Hellman's view of 1900's America. Having Toland take full charge of his particular way of composition in service of the story as opposed to style over substance is the key to making this movie and its performances work otherwise it would be just another chamber drama in three acts. His and Wyler's direction allow for every minute detail in Davis' topnotch performance to come through the chilling scene with her sitting in the sofa looking dead ahead as her husband crawls to his death up the stairs is one of remarkable power  more so due to its restraint of emotion as is the final scene when she watches Alexandra leave and retreats from the windows into shadows.There's an interesting similarity in this film and Ingmar Bergman's CRIES AND WHISPERS. Both films had a virtuous person who was near death both films had characters who were essentially monsters flaunting their ugliness to each other each movie had one sympathetic female who walks away from the claustrophobic household and into a better future. Obviously the similarity is thematic siblings as monsters have been seen since Shakespeare but in a time where period dramas relied more on romance and less on the underlying yet savage cruelty people inflict on each other THE LITTLE FOXES is definitely one who has dated well. The only scene which lacks a little punch is the final scene in which Alexandra confronts Regina. It diminishes Alexandra's character somewhat makes her weak but I think also it's the choice Teresa Wright took when applying herself to this role plus it was her first film appearance against none other than Bette Davis in full command of Who she was. Aside from that this is a somewhat difficult yet absorbing drama to watch and after seeing Davis as Regina Giddens it would be hard to see Tallulah conveying Regina's cold cruelty. A great film.".

His and Wyler's direction allow for every minute detail in Davis' topnotch performance to come through the chilling scene with her sitting in the sofa looking dead ahead as her husband crawls to his death up the stairs is one of remarkable power  more so due to its restraint of emotion as is the final scene when she watches Alexandra leave and retreats from the windows into shadows.There's an interesting similarity in this film and Ingmar Bergman's CRIES AND WHISPERS. Both films had a virtuous person who was near death both films had characters who were essentially monsters flaunting their ugliness to each other each movie had one sympathetic female who walks away from the claustrophobic household and into a better future. Obviously the similarity is thematic siblings as monsters have been seen since Shakespeare but in a time where period dramas relied more on romance and less on the underlying yet savage cruelty people inflict on each other THE LITTLE FOXES is definitely one who has dated well. The only scene which lacks a little punch is the final scene in which Alexandra confronts Regina. It diminishes Alexandra's character somewhat makes her weak but I think also it's the choice Teresa Wright took when applying herself to this role plus it was her first film appearance against none other than Bette Davis in full command of Who she was. Aside from that this is a somewhat difficult yet absorbing drama to watch and after seeing Davis as Regina Giddens it would be hard to see Tallulah conveying Regina's cold cruelty. A great film.";

I'll talk about some other thingsBette Davis for me there're no more than 5 actresses which would deserve the title of best actress ever Katharine Hepburn Ingrid Bergman Audrey Hepburn Barbra Stanwyck and of course Bette. She was the best playing evil women heartless unmerciful ones. And there's no doubt that the character of Reggina Gibbens gathers all those characteristics together. The performing of Bette Davis is memorable as expected and the way she says things such as I don't hate you I just feel contempt for you... that are just like a punch in your face. There should be a picture of Mrs. Davis in the dictionaries next to that sentence that says look that kills. Bette Davis was the look that killed. The Film Millimetric it would be a nice word to define the script. Some of the dialogues of Little Foxes are part of the history of cinema especially the ones between Reggina and her husband. The scene in which she watches him have a heartattack is simply devastating. There are lots of long shotsequences that intensify the tension and Wyler's sense of rhythm is something to be shown in Cinema School even nowadays especially nowadays.We got the Gioconda the Baslica of San Pedro in Vatican the Guernica... and we got movies such as The Little Foxes. My rate 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a surprisingly good movie  for me not people who like Bette Davis and melodramas. They got what they hoped for another solid film with her starring in it. I don't particularly care for Davis or soaps but I liked this film and see it more of a straight drama anyway especially because of the crisp dialog.It's a story about money and how to use it or how to acquire more of it through deceit and greed. Davis as Regina Gidden is the most greedy of the Gidden clan vying for more money with her brothers who aren't exactly trustworthy people themselves. Among the three there wasn't anyone to root for since the family shared in their lust for money. Davis does her normal excellent acting job but I enjoyed Charles Dingle as Uncle Ben Hubbard best. I liked his lines more than anyone's and the way he delivered them. Carl Benton Reid played the other greedy Hubbard brother Oscar and Dan Duryea was interesting as Oscar's dumb son 'Leo.Herbert Marshall was good too as Regina's husband Horace. He was an honest principled man and thus the black sheep in that household. Unfortunately he was dying and his death played a big part in this story.The subplot in this tale is the comingofage of Hubbard daughter Alexandra played by Teresa Wright. Her coming of age translates to finally standing up to her domineering mother. Richard Carlson plays her reluctant boyfriend David Hewitt who in the end is won over when Alexandra grows up. So this excellent cast complemented by an outstanding director in William Wyler and worldclass cinematographer Gregg Toland all adds up to a solid memorable film.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is 1905 or so. Ben Hubbard is still apparently head of the Hubbard family. He certainly is the stronger of the two brothers Oscar is now a sullen cypher due to his marriage to chatterbox delicate lady Birdie Bagtry  we later learn that Oscar does not hesitate to slap his poor wife around. Oscar does have a son Leo but Leo has inherited all of his father's youthful stupidity and has none of the smarts that grandfather Marcus and Uncle Ben or even daddy Oscar have. Regina is still in third position  but Ben is aware that if it were a matter of brains she might replace him as she wants to badly. She is married to Horace Giddens the president of the town bank and they have a daughter Alexandra. Unlike the socially challenged and viciously stupid Leo Alexandra has managed to pick up her father's gentle personality and is when he is around quite happy. She also has a boyfriend the local newspaper reporter David Hewlitt Richard Carlson.A northerner Russell Hicks is interested in a scheme the Hubbards have in which they supply him the grown picked and processed cotton in their mills ship them to him and he turns them into cotton clothing and goods. Hicks is really interested but he needs financial reassurance on their parts in a couple of weeks. Ben and Oscar are ready with their money  but Regina is stalling. She explains that she is waiting for Horace who is in poor health  he has a heart condition to return home before she gives their share. For Ben and Oscar figure that it is Horace who will be their partner.This is the beginning of THE LITTLE FOXES. Ben and Oscar Charles Dingle and Carl Benton Reid  both from the Broadway cast are surprised when Horace shows total hostility to the scheme he detests his greedy inlaws and hates the thought of assisting them in anything. Regina tries to reassure them but Ben is not trusting her.The marriage of Horace and Regina is quite dead. We know that Regina loved another John Bagtry but Horace made the mistake of falling for Regina and then marrying her. He has found her icy and unloving and as greedy as her two brothers. The only good thing to come out of the marriage is the birth of his daughter Alexandra who fortunately takes after him. Leo Dan Duryea  also from the original cast turns out to have the key to saving the business deal. He knows that Horace has a set of bearer bonds in his safety deposit box that are meant for Alexandra when she marries. He tells Oscar about these bonds and Oscar relates the news to Ben. The good thing about these bonds is anyone can use them. And it's not difficult to replace them. So Leo after he is shown that he is definitely not going to be a partner in this business deal steals the bonds. Horace should not ask for the bonds soon  shouldn't he?Of course Horace does. But he springs a surprise on Regina which displeases her and leads to their final confrontation a painful and fatal one. Horace hates Ben and Oscar for their opportunistic economics to get to the top on the shoulders of everyone else. He wouldn't help them because he hates their kind who may threaten the country. But he does loathe his wife  and that might change his mind.The film is one of the best filmed plays from Hollywood's Golden Age. Bette Davis' evil Regina has been called a woman in an unearthly mask covering all her emotions to the highpoint of the story  but letting her eyes tell what is in her mind. This film may also be the best dramatic performance by Herbert Marshall although his wronged husband opposite Davis in THE LETTER is close. The four pros from Broadway do wonderfully particularly Dingle who occasionally reveals a playful streak  like a panther toying with it's victims and Duryea as an opportunist who otherwise is quite stupid and vicious. Dingle even boasts that one day he and his type will rule this country in answer in a way to Horace's fears. Reid looks soulless and vindictive and Pauline Collinge as Birdie arouses the audience's sympathy. As for the young lovers Wright gained her first Academy Award nomination in her confrontation scene with Davis and Carlson gains our general approval by demonstrating what should have been done to Leo years earlier.As for the title it comes out of the Old Testament. Oddly enough the actual quote includes the title of another film of the 1940s for our vines have tender grapes.".

Collinge as Aunt Birdie gives a performance equal in merit to Davis's. She gives this woman a crushed soul and breaks our hearts. Marshall with his fine voice and dignified manners is typically appealing understated yet impressive. Duryea is enjoyably hissable.Gregg Toland's deepfocus blackandwhite photography is intensely satisfying throughout no more so than in all those shots of people walking up the staircase with the camera at the top of the stairs. The director William Wyler demonstrates his usual ability to bring cinematic life to stage plays. Lillian Hellman has adapted her own play which is too heavyhanded in its leftist sentiments about money and power but her points about greedy selfish people are nevertheless well taken.

Both have a rather downbeat and moralistic ending but here the sudden end to the story comes as a bit of a disappointment. Too bad that William Wyler didn't stress the loneliness theme of Bette's character to give more strength to the ending that merely shows her watching her daughter walking away from her in the rain with a young man.But aside from the abrupt and rather weak ending this is a magnificent version of the Lillian Hellman stage play. I saw Elizabeth Taylor in a Broadway revival of the show years ago and she left none of the impact that BETTE DAVIS does here. Davis had the benefit of William Wyler's direction as did all other members of the cast.HERBERT MARSHALL is excellent as the only truly decent main character in the story. His performance here is reminiscent of the work he did as Bette's weak husband in THE LETTERbut the scene where she denies him his medicine is as brilliantly played and filmed as any scene in the entire film.TERESA WRIGHT is a bit sugary as the sweet daughter but rises to the final momentsalthough I thought her last confrontation with her mother could have been even more harsh than Wyler permitted it to be. She and Davis were both Oscar nominated but lost to others. This scene loses some of its vitality due to Wright's lowkey playing.All the other performers are more than equal to their tasks and the beautiful deep focus BW photography of Gregg Toland is remarkable and deepens the tone of the story. Charles Dingle stands out particularly in the supporting cast as Bette's conniving brother who is left in the end with nothing but a sense of humor about the outcome. Dan Duryea is convincing as the dumb Leo and Richard Carlson does nicely as Wright's boyfriend who realizes that she has a lot of learning to do about the household before she grows up.Most chilling aspect of the whole film is Bette Davis' towering performance as Reginaperhaps the most realistic of all of her bad roles.But for an even more powerful study of greed I suggest you watch TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE.".

	schema:headline " Davis at Her Evil Best";
	schema:reviewBody "A gleefully macabre and intensely suspenseful movie based on the Lillian Hellman play. Bette Davis sinks her teeth into the role of icy bitch Regina Giddens with such relish that you can practically hear her sighing with satisfaction at getting away from the noble sufferer roles that had so recently made her famous in films like Jezebel and Dark Victory. She's monstrous here as the frigid wife of Herbert Marshall waiting impatiently for him to die so that she can get her talons on his inheritance. A group of conniving brothers are trying to outsmart her and claim the inheritance for themselves but they have no idea who they're dealing with. We ultimately can forgive Davis for her reptilian selfishness because she's driven to it out of survival. If you want to play with the big boys the movie seems to say you have to learn to be one yourself.This is a lesson her sisterinlaw Birdie hasn't learned and as a result is a fluttering neurotic mess of a woman bulldozed by her husband and supreme example of exactly the kind of woman Regina refuses to be. Birdie is played by Patricia Collinge in a devastatingly heartbreaking performance. Just watch her in the scene where her husband slaps her you can almost literally see the life drain out of her as she accepts her misery as a cage from which she doesn't ever really hope or feels she deserves to escape.And as the moral conscience of the film Teresa Wright plays Regina's daughter Alexandra slow to pick up on the treacherous games her own mother is playing.The classic scene in this film is the one in which Regina's husband actually dies. She's sitting feet away from him watching him gasp for breath while refusing to get the medication that could save his life and Davis's creepy empty expression shows us just how little compassion or sympathy or even any emotion other than greed and vengeance remains in this grotesque twisted creature. Marvelous! Grade A".

	onyx:emotionText "A gleefully macabre and intensely suspenseful movie based on the Lillian Hellman play. Bette Davis sinks her teeth into the role of icy bitch Regina Giddens with such relish that you can practically hear her sighing with satisfaction at getting away from the noble sufferer roles that had so recently made her famous in films like Jezebel and Dark Victory. She's monstrous here as the frigid wife of Herbert Marshall waiting impatiently for him to die so that she can get her talons on his inheritance. A group of conniving brothers are trying to outsmart her and claim the inheritance for themselves but they have no idea who they're dealing with. We ultimately can forgive Davis for her reptilian selfishness because she's driven to it out of survival.

It's all overseen by cold cruel Regina Bette Davis who will do anything to get what she wants.Just simply this is great. I was never bored once during the entire 2 hours this ran. I literally couldn't stop watching. The script very close to the play is wonderfulone great line after another. It's also welldirected by William Wylerjust his composition of shots was incredible. Purportedly he put his actors through hell with take after takebut it works. This is a rare movie where ALL the acting is greatnot one bad performance up there. Teresa Wright is a little too whinybut this was her first film. Even Richard Carlson is good! Who ever knew he was so handsome and could act? He was wasted in all those action and scifi pics he did. Davis of course gives the best performance. She obviously relishes playing a totally evil character.This movie has many great moments but for me there are two highlightsCarlson has a GREAT moment where he casually tells off Davis how many actors can stand up to Davisand live? and the last talk between Davis and Herbert Marshall playing her husband. This isn't for everybodywith the exceptions of Carlson Marshall and Wright there isn't one sympathetic character. This may be too cold and cruel for some viewers but I was fascinated throughout. One of Davis' best performances. Don't miss this one! A 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Regardless of any inconsistencies between this and the play The Little Foxes is a cinematic triumph. This film also achieves greatness due in part to the fact that in the early days of cinema film and plays were much more similar mediums. Now it is the plays that are trying to catch up and be more visually involving and trying to compete with what film can do. Upon finding out that the title came from the Song of Solomon my first instinct was that they should have quoted it to start the film. And they did that and the title card insert weren't intrusive at all and helped get the story rolling. The piano reciting and the counting of time one and two and three and four were moved from the end of the play. We do get an immediate feel for all of the characters and I don't think the role of Regina could've been better cast on the other hand the only role in this film that I found miscast was that of Leo. In the play he gave off an aura of quite conniving and nervousness only in the end in the film he's just a bumbling buffoon. He was minor however the creation of the David character seemed to be sort of one man chorus in the beginning lifting from Greek Dramatic tradition it fits well within the context of a small town and we get a sense of who the Hubbard's are without the necessity for a major expository scene. What we get throughout this film aside from brilliant acting is breathtaking cinematography. The set was used to perfection and the combination not only of deep focus photography but of crowded frames with many people in the made it a very involving experience. A sense of depth through the use of obstruction and open doors leading into other areas of the house being visible made the film seem very immediate. Wyler's brilliant directorial effort shines through not only in his framing and photography but in the acting. In one particular scene Birdie Patricia Collinge was sitting in the background through an extensive conversation and she was so still I thought she was a painting. Bette Davis is absolutely fantastic in this film there isn't enough that can be said about her. She's not on screen all the time but her presence is tremendous. Wyler also made sure that she was the one who turned off lights more than once so that she'd be in shadow while the others were in the lights to show that her evil supercedes all other characters in this play. She's also in the shadows at the end when she hears about Zan and Leo and one of the characters only appears as a shadow in a scene. David comes in later and he is used for many things. He's going to be the love interest though he's very underplayed and he will be who Zan runs off with. Due to the fact that there was talk of Leo and Zan being married David also allowed for the audience to breath easier and thinks that he was the only option. The role of the AfricanAmericans is enlarged in this film version. In the beginning there is a scene with the servants by themselves which is not in the play and this is used to represent the Hubbard's evil rather than to do anything to with equality. The AfricanAmericans in this film give very stereotypical performances even though there were some progressive aspects to their characters in this film. First there was the gradation between Cal and the man at the bank and also the fact that Addie got involved in family discussions along with the singing of Negro spirituals. The screenplay is excellent for many reasons. The film also added the use of simultaneous dialogue which is not indicated in the play at all and it was tremendously affective. We also see that Zan has been selected to be the heroine of the film which was the absolute correct choice and she was quite aptly played by Teresa Wright. The use of Leo and Ben shaving to discuss the safety deposit box is a great touch and adds for more interesting photography. There was the use of the medicine bottle cracking to foreshadow Horace's death. I also found that much of the dialogue that I thought sounded awful when I read it sounded excellent when it was performed. A prime example of this was Birdie's 'Hiccups' speech and Regina saying she didn't want her and Zan to be 'Bad Friends.' And some things that should've been dropped were such as the whole scene where Leo is screaming and that whole the bow is in the house thing was very repetitive and the film cut to the chase. There are also great lines that I think were added for the film like 'ain't the facts that are hazy its Leo' and Horace saying to Leo 'Thank you for being so solicitous.' The music was minimal but perfect it was used to underscore the fact that Birdie didn't like Leo. While we don't like any of the characters and when we read it it is kind of flat it gets some emotional value through the music. We also get a great amount of tension when we get the first close up of the film very near the end we see Regina saying What kind of joke are you playing now? when she and Horace are fighting. Then we also get the wonderful scene where we see Better Davis biding her time waiting to cause a scene as her husband stumbles to his death. It's also chilling the way Regina talks business again right after Horace's death.Why mama are you afraid? this line had no impact in the text but works wonderfully in the film we see the standoff and they walk away from each other. Zan and David run off together.".

The conniving Regina decides to send her daughter Alexandra Teresa Wright to fetch her father from a hospital in Baltimore so that she Regina can convince him to invest in her brothers' scheme. Upon his return Horace is very ill but not too ill to refuse to participate in his inlaw's plans. Finally Regina with her back against the wall decides to stop at nothing to get her way resulting in a tragic conclusion for all involved.Recommendations Perfectly directed by William Wyler this film is brilliant from beginning to end. The beautiful black and white Art Direction the crispclean editing and the wonderful score all help to make this movie pitch perfect. Of course it helps that the play's original author adapts her own blistering screenplay to wondrous results. All that said it is the performances of Bette Davis Teresa Wright and Patricia Collinge as the heartbreaking Aunt Birdie that make this film soar. Herbert Marshall Charles Dingle and Carl Benton Reid all give strong supporting performances. Also Richard Carlson as David Hewitt the man who loves Alexandra Dan Duryea as Leo Hubbard the no good nephew of Regina and Horace and Jessica Grayson as Addie the faithful house servant all make their secondary roles utterly memorable.

The story unfolds gradually and even if you don't know the background to the film you are filled in on it in due course.It seems to have been shot on some nonfancy digital cameras. Nevertheless it has a real cinematographic feel to it with cutaway material that transcends its status as Broll footage and becomes a series of vignettes sustained slowpaced studies that are a delight in their own right and perfectly augment the main content which is interviews.The music is beautiful and I note the composer recently received an award for this.What is most striking about the film is the tenderness and humanity of its intervention into the life of its subjects. It brings you totally into their world for the duration of the film  and not just in terms of the broader issues being discussed the everyday small moments that are part of their routine are given great resonance and become imbued with imprint of the past event.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every writer has a story. Something that brought them to who they are and what they do. Sometimes they are really cool stories and sometimes they are not. Other times they are stories that a writer has been so affected by that they just don't talk about it all that much. Never the less it is a story and it is the backbone of what makes them writers. It tends to inform the stories they tell and how they tell it. In some ways you have to have one in order to be a writer. My experience has been that if you don't your stories don't tend to be that interesting. They come off flat and not really worth the time to read which is not to say that you can't find a good story to tell if you work hard enough. Writing just tends to come easier if you have a story that you really need to tell. The story flows better and emotionally connects with people reading it. At least that's been my experience given my own history as a writer.Anne Perry is a writer with a story to tell. Interestingly enough though she seems to avoid talking about it with any great detail. You can find details if you are interested and they are put forward in the documentary about her but it's a difficult topic to hear about. Once you do though you can completely understand why it might be hard to say much about it. A writer internalizes most of their problems and emotions. That is why they tend to write such great stories because what they won't say to a person they will say in the words on the page. It can be buried under a lot of the things the stories they are telling need in order to make it interesting for the reader but they are there if you look hard enough. For Anne Perry it seems that finding that involves reading into the opposite of what she writes about. She is searching for something deep and meaningful in her life and many of her characters apparently reflect that reality but the reason for their search is the real prize of understand her.Ultimately writing is a long and difficult process for everyone. Even for someone who has written 40 books it takes time to make it feel and sound right for the people who might one day read it. This movie is a long and drawn out process but the pay off for lack of a better way to describe it is well worth the time and effort to get through it. Anne Perry  Interiors is a film worth watching for any writer who has ever felt frustrated sitting at a table staring at a blank page or computer screen. For anyone else it's a deep inside look at where the urge to write tends to come from and will give you a deeper understanding of the life of a writer.To check out more of my reviews go herehttpandrewheard.blogspot.ca".

My god yes this movie is Sailor Moon's finest art detail that you'll ever see from the series this is in fact the best art you'll see before Sailor Stars which takes a hit in the art department. The quality here is exceptional. Colors are the best I've ever seen in the series shading is typical Sailor Moon and fans to the series should recognize it from the first series art detail is something out of the third and fourth season but the style of the characters drawn seems to be a combination and throwback to the first season. The movie is hardly realistic as far as design  everything is uberly colored looks like it is basked in pastel lighting and otherwise uber saturated without being overly lighted. Sailor Moon has always been about this and stood out for its art. The only complaint I could say about the character designs it that they seem uberly skinny compared to their television show counterparts  characters look uberly skinny ala anime yet maintain a 'Barbie'ish style design  young ChibiUSA Rini is literally adult proportioned for anime yet still looks like a young kid. Older characters just by four years are suddenlyWhen watching the opening montage it is nice to see the characters in their youth it's a nice change for the characters and fans that have followed the series up until this point. However when finally seeing the movie in the swing of things it becomes apparent what most of the series has been about when it wasn't following suite with 'monster of the day' the series bears reminiscent to old Peanuts style comic strips where characters live their lives and enjoy both the joys and pitfalls of their actions.Pacing of the movie plays out like a well made movie  something of the modern era. It's hard to see until you've seen a modern movie  this movie holds its own in this department. Yet it's old  it doesn't show it  it just looks like a cartoon with a very sharp drawing style and overtly saturated environment of colors. Music is good plays out where it should  and the minimal use of sound effects is tastefully done where due. There is definitely more eye candy and animation going on before there is any sound effects voice acting for my copy was in English but by this point the dub for America has peaked and the characters sound and act how Americans have come to expect.Let's talk about individual characters  each is stylized with a specific style  right down from their wardrobe to their looks. Each character does not have much of a distinct personality but as far as this version is concerned it is reflected more in their attitude and voice acting.Lastly the movie has the typical shoujou transformation sequence. They are adorned like super heroes strangely enough  yet they also look like girls in dresses and tuxedos like a masquerade.The variety show kicks in the minute the outer senshi appear they seem to have lots of acrobatics with a showstopping number in addition. There is little way in the mood of emotional drama though the emotional distress and discomfort of the characters does play out a few times. It's all plot until an evil madwoman appears to use the world as her own tool why she wants to do it isn't really alluded  other than the fact it is nothing short of a battery for her own usage. One of her own henchmen turns on her and proves to be her undoing. The movie alludes to numerous moments between love and friendship and sweet emotions triumphing over all. This is the main theme of the movie.Enter the realm of candy coated dreams a world in which dreams are a false reality and a moon princess intends to stop it. It's only a little over an hour long but wonderfully made for what is presented on screen. I've seen some three hour live action movies that don't go this far and indepth.The evil queen is out to kidnap and steel the dream energy of the next generation of youth and the Sailor Senshi are here to save dreams and put an end to her terrorism. She isn't really out to be a terrorist she just uses terrorist activity to get what she wants  dream energy to fuel her blackhole  essentially a giant battery.Originally posted to Orion Age httpwww.orionphysics.com?p7882.".

It stars Heinz Ruhmann Sigfrit Steiner Siegfried Lowitz Michel Simon and Gert Frobe. Music is by Bruno Canfora and cinematography is by Ernst Bolliger and Heinrich Gartner.When a child is found murdered in the woods Oberleutnant Matthai Ruhmann promises the child's parents he will find the killer.

There's a whole bunch of themes bubbling away in the story all of which are handled superbly by the makers. At its core it's a criminal investigation fuelled by an obsession but morality and mob justice play a big part in proceedings as well.Lashings of intrigue permeate the atmosphere as does a number of suspenseful scenes as the child killer enters the fray and we see him operating his vile shtick. The sequences of him at home a complete milquetoast to a harpy wife simmer away with deadly expectation the acting superb. The psychological studies of the key characters carry considerable weighty merit always niggling away at the audience keeping us hooked to the very last frame.With chills for instance the hand puppet scenes are blood curdling expressionistic touches and a film noir sense of the human condition gone wrong it's a film deserving of a more wider and appreciative audience. Personally I prefer the ending that Durrenmatt rewrote as Das Versprechen the author wasn't happy with Es geschan am hellichten Tag's resolution and that was the ending Penn went for in The Pledge. This is not in the same class as Fritz Lang's M but it deserves to be on the same shelf and that is praise indeed. 810".

At the beginning appears as main suspect an unfortunate vagrant incomparable Michael Simon.

The picture functions on various levels with superb roles nicely played by the entire casting and a wellpaced screenplay that leads to the climax with the presence of the serial killer along with the kid and the possible tragedy . Friedrich Drrenmatt wrote the script while at the same time developing the novel form of the story under the title Das Versprechen . He completed the book after the movie was finished and gave it a different  much darker ending . Its perfect developing resides not in displays of frenzied action and grisly violence like happens in modern cinema  but rather lies about interesting characters and suspenseful happenings . Atmospheric white and black cinematography by Heinrich Guerner and appropriate musical score with thrilling leitmotif by Bruno Cantafora . The motion picture was well written by Ladislao Vadja together with Hans Jacoby and Friedrich Durrenmatt and excellently directed . Vadja was author of magnificent movies  such as  'The miracle of Marcelino'  'Angel passed on Brooklyn'  and 'Uncle Jacinto' . In my opinion this is one of the best films to come out of Europe in the decade of the 50s . If you like thoughtful and brooding films that are exciting and rich pace with rhythm but no displaying a great deal of action  you'll like this one . Other movies about this exciting novel are the followings  'The cold light of day' directed by Rudolf Van Den Berg with Richard E Gant  a German version 1997 directed by Nick Hoffman  and American version 'The pledge' by Sean Penn with Jack Nicholson  Benicio Del Toro and Robin Wright Penn .".

This was remade in 2001 by director Sean Penn with Jack Nicholson in the lead role and with a totally different ending and a more downbeat feel to it. I had already seen it and liked it before I saw this but now I prefer this version. The subject matter may be a bit unsettling to parents but the treatment is first rate and with very believable dubbed American words.

The unrelenting gloom of the film was probably what made it less palpable for audiences at the time of its release. I have to wonder if that atmosphere of despair was taken from the book or simply inserted by Penn in his adaptation of the screenplay.This version from the late 50's is nonetheless a very effective thriller in its own way with great performances and very well directed. Gert Frobe Goldfinger gives a very chilling portrait of the killer while Heinz Ruhmann as Detective Matthai is excellent too and carries the film well.It's simply one of those solid and welldone black and white thrillers from an earlier era that slips under the wire and that should be rediscovered again by contemporary audiences.

	schema:reviewBody "We stand here before one of the most important German speaking movies of the second half of the 20st century one of the first explicit series child killer movies and one of the most frightful ones. It contains a creme De la creme of the best German actors of the fifties. However although the movie plays in Switzerland all Swiss actors speak HighGerman and are without exception in side roles. The male main role of Kommissar Dr. Matthi is played by Heinz Rhmann who was the most popular German actor of the 20st century. The female main role was given by the HungarianCatalan director Lszl Vajda to his girlfriend Mara Rosa Salgado who was dubbed. The fact that not one example of Bndner German is heard in this movie although the series killer lives obviously in Chur the capital of the Grisons is strange. Even stranger is that the only used Bndner German Name Huonder is constantly mispronounced by Max Haufler who should have known it better. However two questions arise First why did the director agree to Rhmann and his scenariowriter to change dramatically the end? In Drrenmatts novel Der Verdacht Schrott is not caught and the movie has therefore a completely different face. Second and more important and hanging together with the first question What is this movie about really? Several times we hear from the mouth of Dr Matthi about the importance of using intution in clearing a criminal case. But why then is it Matthi who in the end is responsible for the suicide of the chapman? Matthi is even fully unable to see his guilt To the question on the next day why the innocent chapman is found hung up in his cell he laconically answers Because he was old sick did not want to go on anymore ... . What is it then that drives Matthi to catch the real killer? Really his pity with the children?  Hardly because his character does know or at least not admit such feelings. As a proof he does not doubt one second about the legitimation of his method when he engages Mrs. Haller and her daughter because he intends to misuse the blond little girl as a guineapig in order to attract Schrott. Not even then when he realizes that the little girl has already escaped several times without him knowing it and when he speaks himself about a miracle that nothing has yet happened he stops his action. This means that Matthi rather accepts the death of the little girl as long as he is just capable of catching the murderer. This is an idea about police work which is practically identical with the idea of the criminal. Admittedly the serious killer stands on the other side of Good and Bad than Matthi but somebody who is intending to take the loss of the girl in order to solve his case is sotosay the twin of the criminal the line between Good and Bad getting almost nonexistent.".

	schema:reviewBody "Der Verdacht The Suspicion by Friedrich Drrenmatt is one of my favourite plays and even books. Packed with suspense it provides deep insights into the relations between crime justice and revenge. The book makes a point of not ending like a normal crime story with the inspector apprehending the criminal. In the book the monster gets away and his hunter becomes corrupted and mired. The movie is clearly less bold much more middleoftheroad and ends almost happily. It's well made very well acted featuring three heavyweights of German postwar cinema Heinz Rhmann Siegfried Lowitz and Gerd Frbe and overall watchable but it's not anywhere near as bold or good as the book.Both book and film deal with sexual child abuse which in this form was a novelty at the time. Unfortunately it reinforces the stereotype of children being threatened by the evil uncle i. e. a preying stranger while by far the most sexual abuse to children is committed not by strangers but by people known to the children  male relatives teachers priests etc. Also the perpetrator is not a pedophile per se but driven to his acts by a dominating wife cherchez la femme.The movie is also an interesting document of the social mores at the time. Although he's innocent and does the right thing by reporting the crime the vagabond I suspect he's meant to be a Jenischer i. e. someone who's living like a gypsy but isn't one ethnically garners no sympathies whatsoever. Society is cold and uncaring they only want a scapegoat. They're happy to see the vagabond die they wanted to see him lynched in the first place. The way children are displayed as living in a Freudian dream world is also interesting.".

	schema:reviewBody "Es geschah am hellichten Tag or It Happened in Broad Daylight is a German 95minute blackandwhite film from the late 1950s so this one will have its 60th anniversary soon. It was directed by Ladislao Aajda who also adapted Friedrich Drrenmatt's novel with Drrenmatt himself for the screen. Today this one is seen as one of Germany's finest films especially in terms of crime drama. Heinz Rhmann is almost in every scene from start to finish and he was nominated for a German Film Award for his portrayal here. Same goes for Gert Froebe who has considerably less screentime though and does pretty much not appear at all in the first half of the film. This one is really all about the main character's a police detective's relationship with his employer and also about a man who was arrested despite being innocent.For Froebe his villain role here may have been one of the main reasons who he got cast in his careerdefining role as Auric Goldfinger so even if he lost the German Film Award just like Rhmann it was a very important film for him. Rhmann in his mid 50s here was mostly known in German for the comedy films he made earlier in his career that made him a big star but here he shows us that he also definitely has the talent for darker more gritty films. It was quite fun to watch him with the serious material in here. Overall this was a quite good watch in terms of story performances and atmosphere. I think you may want to check this one out. Thumbs up for Es geschah am hellichten Tag and I see the film was popular enough that they made a sequel several decades later shortly after Rhmann's death with Joachim Krl playing the main character but I have not seen that one. And there are more sequels from outside Germany. But this one here is the original. Go see it.".

This is seriously seriously unethical behavior especially if one takes into account the fact that both the little girl and her mother regard the police inspector as their kindly benefactor. The movie does not fully explore the moral or rather immoral weight and ramifications of this act. Problem two concerns the psychological evolution of the retired police inspector. When the movie starts the inspector is shown as a pretty decent policeman  not a saint perhaps nor a bundle of laughs but certainly someone with a working conscience and a sense of right and wrong. This in other words is a man who knows there are certain lines one should not cross. Later on the same man tethers a goat  child to a tree which is a hideously transgressive act. So where does this ruthlessness or cruelty or callousness or blindness or fanaticism or... come from ? Why and how does the man give himself permission to behave like this ?

	schema:reviewBody "Let me just start by saying that as a young woman I was taken by surprise by the film and even shocked at times but I felt that the film had a very powerful impact. An impact that has nothing to do with pedophilia. Well at least not for me. The plot involves Fabrizio his dog and Laura a young teen that is madly in love with him. After meeting him a year ago she returns to him during the summer months. Fabrizio chooses to live his life as a king in the forest and delights in taunting and tormenting young Laura. Honestly there were moments when I wanted to strangle this actor but that was the intention of the director. Fabrizio enjoys mentally abusing Laura as well as treating her like a prisoner. When Laura and Fabrizio climb the Blue Mountain one afternoon Fabrizio decides that he wants to rule the forgotten city and needs a queen. However young Laura will not do because she must return to her parents at night instead of staying by his side. Clearly Fabrizio is letting the Peter Pan syndrome get to him a bit too much... The two young teens share a fairly graphic first sexual encounter one that made me feel a bit uncomfortable I must admit but Fabrizio's morbid behavior toward Laura is even more disturbing after they make love for the first time. One day the duo meet Sylvia a young teen that lives in a house outside the forest. Unlike Laura Sylvia is very arrogant and pampered looking. However I feel that Laura was by far lovelier. Fabrizio being angered by Laura tells her that he will forgive her if she gets Sylvia to join their games. Thus she does as he commands and Sylvia and Fabrizio become partners in crime. They are both as cruel as the other and delight in tormenting Laura in the most hideous ways. I almost had to stop the movie at times because I was so upset by their actions. The scene were Sylvia and Fabrizio hunt Laura like an animal is very very disturbing. Naturally Sylvia and Fabrizio fall in love and delight in a good amount of sexual play. Yes other moments that made me uncomfortable but they are very true of today's teenagers. In the end Sylvia tells Fabrizio that she cannot remain as his queen and must return to school. This fatal admission leads to a tragic ending...The film is very very beautifully made but also very disturbing and depressing. It reminded me of a Grimm's fairy tale for adults. Have you ever read any of those? Also it has similarities to Lord of the Flies as well. I purchased the German XRated DVD release of the film and am very pleased to say that it is uncut. I can completely understand why the film was heavily censored andor banned however as a young woman I can also see the truth in the film. Teenagers are not as innocent as they are often believed and this film is just an example of reality. What bothered me beyond the sexuality was the violence. Seeing poor Laura be the butt of Sylvia and Fabrizio's cruel punishment was almost too much to watch...I highly recommend on its artistic and emotional basis.".

	onyx:emotionText "Let me just start by saying that as a young woman I was taken by surprise by the film and even shocked at times but I felt that the film had a very powerful impact. An impact that has nothing to do with pedophilia. Well at least not for me. The plot involves Fabrizio his dog and Laura a young teen that is madly in love with him. After meeting him a year ago she returns to him during the summer months. Fabrizio chooses to live his life as a king in the forest and delights in taunting and tormenting young Laura. Honestly there were moments when I wanted to strangle this actor but that was the intention of the director. Fabrizio enjoys mentally abusing Laura as well as treating her like a prisoner. When Laura and Fabrizio climb the Blue Mountain one afternoon Fabrizio decides that he wants to rule the forgotten city and needs a queen. However young Laura will not do because she must return to her parents at night instead of staying by his side. Clearly Fabrizio is letting the Peter Pan syndrome get to him a bit too much... The two young teens share a fairly graphic first sexual encounter one that made me feel a bit uncomfortable I must admit but Fabrizio's morbid behavior toward Laura is even more disturbing after they make love for the first time. One day the duo meet Sylvia a young teen that lives in a house outside the forest. Unlike Laura Sylvia is very arrogant and pampered looking. However I feel that Laura was by far lovelier. Fabrizio being angered by Laura tells her that he will forgive her if she gets Sylvia to join their games. Thus she does as he commands and Sylvia and Fabrizio become partners in crime.

	schema:reviewBody "Generally speaking Maladolescenza is NOT my kind of movie. Being a fan of Hunt for Red October The Final Countdown and the like it was rather unusual for me to come across a movie such as Maladolescenza much less order it. The DVD arrived last week and I have watched the movie twice since then. I am still stunned by it.BEGIN SPOILER The movie is about three teenagers who spend their summer vacation together in the mountains of Austria ?. Laura Lara Wendel a 12 year old girl is helplessly in love with Fabrizio Martin Loeb an older boy who lives in the area where she is on vacation. She tries everything to get him to answer her love but Fabrizio somehow gets a kick out of mentally and physically tormenting Laura. Her love for him lets her endure the pain he inflicts on her. However events spiral out of control after Fabrizio and Laura encounter Sylvia Eva Ionesco who is on vacation in the same area.Sylvia is every bit as cruel as Fabrizio and both take great pleasure in tormenting Laura in every way possible the Hideandseek scene as well as the Pitscene being the two most extreme scenes that come to mind. As the summer draws to a close Fabrizio tries to convince Sylvia to remain. She refuses and on their last day together the drama reaches a murderous climaxSPOILER END This movie is definitely a masterpiece. Granted it shows its age in the props and the style the characters dress. Still it is a beautiful picture with very atmospheric camera work and a fitting soundtrack that ranges from beautiful to unnerving even disturbing Watch for the German traditional while Laura is being hunted by Sylvia and Fabrizio.The three kids that I mentioned above in the plot are the only characters in this movie. They have to carry the whole movie which makes their performance even more impressive. Lara Wendel is great in her portrayal of Laura the innocent naive 12year old. You just can't help but feel sorry for the poor little thing. Eva Ionesco while being a beautiful girl plays the part of the arrogant cruel manipulative Sylvia with perfection although even her facade cracks during the last 10 minutes. As for Martin Loeb I did not like him from the very start which means that his portrayal of the sadistic punk is good as well although I still think he is the weakest member of the cast. Don't get me wrong I am commenting on their acting capabilities not on the nude scenes in the movie. These kids were great actors for their age.When Maladolescenza came out it was decried as child pornography almost immediately and the film was banned or heavily cut in many countries.After watching this movie I understood why it is one of the most controversial ones around. The theme of cruelty between kids and the sexual awakening of adolescents is very dangerous territory to tread on. Still it shows that adolescents and teenagers are not the innocent angels that many adults like to think they are as I had to find out the hard way and it does so very well. As for the child porn allegations A German legal board reevaluated this movie this year concluding that it contains no illegal or criminal material.All in all a very controversial cruel but also very beautiful movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie's fame makes people neglect its other contents. Questions about disturbing nudity mean closing eyes to avoid really disturbing questions and messages of the movie. Maladolescenza offers a dark bleak unpolished and sadly realistic picture of growing up of the age that adults consider most beautiful years in whole life either forgetting their youth suppressing their memories the way people often do or maybe indeed being so lucky to have a childhood of dreams.And Maladolescenza is a dreamlike movie a fairy tale that shows how easy can dreams become a nightmare how close are fairy tales to horror. But it also confirms that never during whole human's life this extremes get so close as during school years.Placing the movie in a inexpressibly beautiful nature is an ingenious decision. Such an ambient can hardly fail. Mission Blue Lagoon Six Days Seven Nights Picnic at Hanging Rock... but all these locations are rather exotic Maladolescenza was filmed in the heart of Europe though plot is carefully sited out of place and time showing that beauty is all around if you just look for it. But it creates a contrast.Apart from the first scene a weird one but a hint of Fabrizio's personality the movie starts rather slowly looking as a Saturday morning family movie. The idea to introduce only three characters appears to be effective  no one influences the kids what makes the movie message even more disturbing this shows what kids are no one forces them to do what they do. Especially Fabrizio who lives in forest seems not to have much contact with rest of the world his cruelty is immanent essential. Sylvia is not much different though she is a product of civilization she not only joins Fabrizio's behaving but induces more creative way of torture gained in our modern human world. We can imagine her doing everything to be with most popular boy in the class then with best sportsman in the school later maybe with some popstar...Finally Laura. The opposite character played by Lara Wendel who came from nowhere. While Ionesco was already a famous photo model  her acting can be annoyingly stilted but fits into Sylvia's character  and Loeb played main role in Mes petites amoreuses Lara is almost a newbie in movies as Laura is a newbie in teenadulthood. But unlike Sylvia she is shy obeys parent's orders being home on time and they trust her letting her be away from home whole day. A perfect victim for bullying.So this movie makes one of the best analyzes of bullying ever made on screen. A surprise for 70's because the amount of this problem was recognized recently. Some movies dealt with bullying but hardly ever in such a pure form until Larry Clark's Kids his Bully though using that word deals with consequences of bullying in young adults who still keep the same interpersonal relations. Only Scandinavians who at least in movies understand children as if they had invented them dare to handle it either as subplots or even main plots Rubber Tarzan Det skaldede spogelse Saning eller konsekvens.... In other cinematographies victims of bullying are usually characters made to laugh at as if they deserved their fate Back to Future where Marty reverses the situation what is unbelievable for real victim..Laura needs Fabrizio. She is lonely. This lonely forest is so uninhabited that she has no other peers. She grew up with Fabrizio and tolerates the changes he is going through. Believing it is only a passing period she accepts her role afraid she would be rejected otherwise. And here we see the difference between bullying and torturing or simple violence Laura isn't running away or avoiding perpetrators e.g. Iluzija Bluebird Fre stormen she constantly returns day after day hoping that things will become as they were before. But they never do. This obedience of the victim feeds bully's strength his feeling of power grows. Sexuality in the movie is not an expression of love as some comments say but it is also not a rape as some others suggest. It is just the way victim is proving her loyalty and obedience.. In the beginning of the movie there is curiosity peeking normal for the age but once when bullyvictim relation is established it affects the sexuality as well. Sylvia who knows the real life better than Fabrizio and Laura noticed or was told already that people mostly females can control others mostly males by proper use of sex. Fabrizio fell in trap and Sylvia mixing the developing adolescentadult sexuality and still existing child cruelty starts an avalanche that leads to tragedy.For Laura this is not just one bad summer. Remember how she was happy to meet Fabrizio. She doesn't ever mention and never misses anything from outer world. Probably she hasn't good experiences there either it's easy to assume she's been bullied in school too  victims are special type of children and bullies will always recognize them. And now the only safe and beautiful place became equal or even worse than her everyday world. The only true and gentle friend became equal or worse than the others. It's not hard to trace this fate to psychic disorders or suicides so frequent in teenage years.People who are easily offended whose attitudes don't allow them to watch certain content shouldn't give a try to this movie. But they still shouldn't blame it for being shallow worthless just because of things they've heard about it. The best way of checking is certainly watching and it could be more useful for people who work with children teachers psychologists social workers counselors and for victims of bullying to understand why they couldn't help themselves... though a question why no one else didn't help them always stays unanswered.".

Because of its depictions of children in sexual situations however it has been banned in many countries most recently in Germany in 2006. While I'm not entirely clear about the purpose and intent of the director I did not find it to be any more salacious than the films of Larry Clark and even more beautifully realized and honest. Please be advised however that Maladolescenza is a very disturbing film and is not recommended for those offended by cruelty to animals in this case  a bird or children presented in the nude and in threatening situations.Set to an original score by Pippo Caruso based on medieval songs and dances the film takes place in a brooding forest that holds the ruins of an ancient city. There are only three actors in the film and they deliver memorable performances. Two adolescents Fabrizio Martin Loeb and Laura Lara Wendel live close to the edge of the forest and spend their summer holidays playing together as they have for many years. 12year old Laura is in love with Fabrizio and teases him sexually but he responds only by taunting and frightening her. Like most bullies however he knows just when to let up in order to reassure his victim and give her a false sense of security. When the two discover the mysterious old city Fabrizio declares himself to be king but in order for Laura to be queen she must first be able to win the cruel tests he has devised.Among these are having a snake thrown on top of you as you lay on the ground and being chased by a snarling dog through the woods. Laura like many willing victims proclaims her trust in Fabrizio in spite of his sadism and his killing of her pet bird. When they at last make love together however it is done with tenderness and the film shows Fabrizio as good hearted when it suits his own purposes. When a new 13year old girl Sylvia Eva Ionesco joins the group on the invitation of two friends things do not work to Laura's advantage. Sylvia unlike Laura is manipulative and cold and soon she and Fabrizio join forces to humiliate and frighten Laura at one time compelling her to run through the woods while they shoot bows and arrows at her while wearing terrifying masks.Realizing that Fabrizio and Sylvia have fallen for each other Laura heartbreakingly begins to dress and act like Sylvia to win back Fabrizio's affection but without success. As the summer nears an end Fabrizio is determined that Sylvia will never leave him alone and the result is a senseless tragedy that could have been easily averted. Although the setting is idyllic under the skillful direction of Pier Murgia Maladolescenza maintains a constant atmosphere of impending threat. While the story can be seen as a metaphor for the confusing currents of puberty it can also be interpreted as symbolic of the loss of innocence and the misdirection of sexual energy into avenues of power and domination perhaps an underlying theme in the history of the Third Reich.".

	schema:reviewBody "I own this movie  am proud of it. I live in the good old USA and had to buy my copy in Europe so i could get it uncut the full 93 min version. This movie may be very controversial but anybody who can't see past the nudity is very closed minded. This movie is a brilliant piece of art. The forest alone is worth a million words not to menchine the story. I'm 19 and had a difficult upbringing especially in junior high but this movie nails it the emotions and feelings that i had as a preteen and young teen. I praise this movie for exploring this difficult transition from childhood to adulthood. Anybody who would call this movie pornography is ignorant as far as i'm concerned at most maybe you could argue that it is mild erotica but even that is a stretch. When are people going to realize that nudity does not equal pornography and love making does not always equal sex. Anyway i have to put in my vote as one of the best coming of age movies that i have ever seen a 910. I have seen a lot of movies spending a lot of my winters watching movie after movie I'm a huge movie buff and through my experience i have found that European movies tend to be a lot more honest about feelings love and life in general then do US movies where ratings are based on sex and violence. This movie remains a favorite of mine to this day on how brutally honest it protrays this adolescent transition. A must see for anyone who loves art or who is struggling through adolescence.".

	schema:headline " Hey put some clothes on!";
	schema:reviewBody "Heading into Maladolescenza I was only aware that it was a flick that had young actors getting nekkid. And boy howdy did they! But besides the little bums this flick was surprisingly wellmade and had a plethora of messages to be taken from it.The story revolves a young boy Fabrizio and girl Lara who met the past summer vacation and decided to continue their summer vacations together from here on out. Since the last vacation together they've both changed. Especially the young boy. Instead of innocence and play ruling the day it's quite obvious his hormones are getting the better of him. This is all quite confusing to Lara but since she has grown so fond of Fabrizio she decides to play along. The story takes a different turn when another little girl Silvia shows up which ends up making life even harder for poor Lara. Firstly Maladolescenza is an extremely thoughtprovoking movie. You have young teens stripping their clothes and doing some pretty heavy petting. For anyone who has a real clue this isn't anything out of the norm. Ever watch Maury? Sheeit. Anyways besides getting over the butthole in your face the story has other messages being presented. From parenting issues to loss of innocence loneliness to delusion and more than anything bullying.Going through some of the comments on here I've seen people burst out saying it's pure child porn. In all honesty it could be used for that. It's got little kids naked. Strap a heartrate monitor on a pedophile and I'm sure that it'll explode. With that said I also read that someone said it was tame....what the hell are you watching? How many flicks with adolescent nudity have you seen? Get with it.Ignore and look past all the hype you've heard of it being called nothing but child porn and watch a film that deals with child innocence and bullying on levels that are rarely seen. Recommended for serious and openminded filmgoers.".

The character of Eva Silvia does not evolve to the very end of the film and already appears very versed in the erotic arts  there is no coming of age for her she is a very vain young girl who is already aware of her sexual charms but ultimately is just used and ends the film crying like the little girl she really still is. The boy is an utterly despicable bully while Laura comes across as a very naive and weak victim.".

	schema:headline " Shocking and powerful tale about preteen cruelty";
	schema:reviewBody "Don't let the controversy fools you. Let me tell you this movie has a lot more than nude scenes. Actually it has a VERY DEEP meaning It's a perfect tale visually beautiful and with a great score.This is one of those rare films you want to stop in the first minutes because what is shown goes beyond you but for some reason you keep watching. It leaves a mark on you. This film is not for everybody not recommended for those close minded conservative people who think kids are completely innocent creatures with no sexual desire no bad intentions no nothing. I mean you have to admit they are human beings too. Then you will be able to see what is in the core of this tale.The story is about 3 adolescents who spend their holidays in a forest. I can't help finding these 3 characters highly stereotypical but this is necessary. Actually this is how the film works because you can find these stereotypes in almost every personLaura Lara Wendel 12 the lovely sensitive and naive girl who is in love with someone who doesn't love her back the girl who will do ANYTHING to be with the others even if that means to be humiliated to death.Fabrizio Martin Loeb 18 the screwedup boy who controls other people deliberately using his strength and selfconfidence superiority the selfish boy who doesn't give a damn for anybody the guy who is bad and enjoy it.Silvia Eva Ionesco 11 the dream blonde coming from outer space the arrogant and malicious girl who is aware of her extreme beauty and will use it to manipulate other people.The acting could have been better but if you have in count these 3 kids were the only characters who carried the entire movie on their shoulders they were great. Personally I think it could have been better to get a younger actor for the Fabrizio character someone closer to the girls age. By the way from these characters Silvia is maybe the least important but on the other hand it is the only one who keeps its feet on the ground. Silvia is not so innocent as Laura and neither so nuts as Fabrizio.I will not extend too much about the story since other posters have commented enough but basically Fabrizio and Silvia spend all their days making fun of Laura and tormenting her through cruel games until the point of risking her life. Just to mention a couple the scene where Laura is tied and with a snake crawling over her and the scene where she is being hunted by the other two bullies using REAL arrows! There are also cruel scenes with animals. All these scenes are raw graphic and really disturbing way more disturbing than the sex scenes most people talk.As for the sex scenes actually most of them are precisely to show the cruelty of Fabrizio and Silvia towards Laura and not to show sex itself. Since Laura loves the boy Silvia and Fabrizio make love not only to enjoy themselves but to torture poor Laura. This movie has been banned in some locations considered as child pornography while actually it is not. Yes I admit the sex scenes are disturbing and could have been done not so graphically but they are not pornographic. They appear nude but you will not see genital joint closeups erections things you would expect in a real XXX film and their movesposes are clumsy because they are unexperienced and obviously not doing it for real. The boldest thing you see is two kids lying down nude one on the other and rubbing or a kiss near the female pubic area. Most of all is left to your mind out of camera frame. Even kisses in mouth are simulated with the position of the heads. In fact this film is not even erotic because the sex scenes are made in a kind of an angelical dream not trying to arouse the audience.Sadly many people cannot see beyond those sex scenes and are not able to discover the real meaning of the story the real evil teenagers can be. Even some covers I have seen of this film make you think wrongly that this is a shallow erotic film. Actually this is a story about cruelty. You will feel sorry for Laura because she is the target she is the third party she is the one who always takes the back seat and is being hated with no reasons. But somehow near the end she is cruel too hiding something important.But I will stop spoiling. If you have the possibility give this film a try because it really worths it. In fact I could even say the story is good for teens maybe not the film because it is very graphic but the story itself teaches you a lot about life and why we are so cruel as adults. After all we all were children once.".

And it couldn't get proper appreciation because the mutilated theatrical release version was a great nothing with most of the essential scenesSPOILEReven the murder at the endEND SPOILER having been cut out. When I saw it first in 1977 it practically left no impression on me whatsoever whereas the uncut version left me completely speechless and unsettled about just how evil it is. Even though it is beautifully photographed has a fantastic score and is extremely well acted by the three young actors it is by now means pleasant to watch. It is a movie that you will often think about long after you have seen it. This one will really haunt you take my word for it! Just a word on the DVD edition that seems to be the only source for the integral version. The releasing company cannot be praised enough for making this film now accessible after 27 years but they could have done a better job with the anamorphic transfer. They could have cleaned the film of disturbing artefacts and they should have been more careful with the English subtitles for the original Italian version. Apparently they have translated the German dialog book because there are things translated in the subtitles that are not said and things that are said are not translated! It is a total mess! And at the end when Fabrizio sits silently on a rock in the caveSPOILERafter just having murdered Sylvia and having sent Laura away I repeat sitting there in complete silence after having committed the murder the subtitles translate the silence telling us that it was a hot summer the two girls were the first love I had and I have never seen them again!!! The German version has a voiceover telling even more precisely that the murdered girl is now a highschool teacher! Such a complete nonsense but clear if you know that the murder scene had been completely omitted in the theatrical release version and that this was the incredibly cheesy original theatrical ending with the voice over narration suggesting that they had just left for home after their vacation in the mountains!END SPOILERThe releasing company should really have made the subtitles according to the spoken word and not according to the German dialog book!

	schema:reviewBody "I really don't know how to judge MALADOLESCENZA. Of course there is huge controversy surrounding the material shown and for good reason. The relatively explicit sexualization of underage actors is going to be a point of contention for many viewers. Being a hardline antichild pornography advocate myself it's hard to dismiss the explicit nudity and sexuality portrayed in this film. But as someone that takes a strong stance against childexploitation  do I consider this film kiddieporn? I have to honestly say no. Does it cross the line of good taste? Yes. Is there any artisticmerit in this film? Again yes. I haven't been this torn by a film in a long time...Note that I saw the film with no subtitles or dubs so I may have missed a bit in translation but the basic storyline concerns a young boy and girl who begin coming into their own against the backdrop of an adultless forest. After their first sexual encounter another young girl enters the picture that is a bit of a controlfreak and the boy and the newgirl begin tormenting the oldgirl by hurting her feelings in every way possible while still pretending to be her friend...Personally I can understand the controversy surrounding MALADOLESCENZA but I can't honestly view the film as a piece of child pornography. I think that it's a harsh comingofage tale that deals with adolescent sexuality in an uncompromising and realistic and even often beautiful manner. I wasn't much older or more experienced than the actors in this film when I had my first sexual encounter  so I can relate to the film on a nostalgic level. Is it unnecessarily graphic  yes. I think that the same story could have been told with less nudity and sexualization but it may not have had the same impact had those scenes been cut. I've seen many films that blur the lines between art and sleaze and MALADOLESCENZA is one of the few that I truly found noteworthy. I think that along with the works of such directors as Larry KIDS KEN PARK Clark  MALADOLESCENZA is a film that will probably be too harsh for mainstream viewing  but I still found it to be hauntingly beautiful yet strangely disturbing at the same time...810".

I haven't been this torn by a film in a long time...Note that I saw the film with no subtitles or dubs so I may have missed a bit in translation but the basic storyline concerns a young boy and girl who begin coming into their own against the backdrop of an adultless forest. After their first sexual encounter another young girl enters the picture that is a bit of a controlfreak and the boy and the newgirl begin tormenting the oldgirl by hurting her feelings in every way possible while still pretending to be her friend...Personally I can understand the controversy surrounding MALADOLESCENZA but I can't honestly view the film as a piece of child pornography. I think that it's a harsh comingofage tale that deals with adolescent sexuality in an uncompromising and realistic and even often beautiful manner. I wasn't much older or more experienced than the actors in this film when I had my first sexual encounter  so I can relate to the film on a nostalgic level. Is it unnecessarily graphic  yes. I think that the same story could have been told with less nudity and sexualization but it may not have had the same impact had those scenes been cut. I've seen many films that blur the lines between art and sleaze and MALADOLESCENZA is one of the few that I truly found noteworthy. I think that along with the works of such directors as Larry KIDS KEN PARK Clark  MALADOLESCENZA is a film that will probably be too harsh for mainstream viewing  but I still found it to be hauntingly beautiful yet strangely disturbing at the same time...810";

	schema:reviewBody "Once in a great while a film comes along that is so unique and controversial that one must take notice. Maladolescenza is such a film. A powerful study of that specific time in life when one is still a child but just at the threshold of becoming an adult. Laura is around 12 years old hopelessly in love with Fabrizio a boy a few years her senior. It is summer and the two spend their days in a fairytalelike forest where Fabrizio imagines himself King looking for his Queen that will stay by his side for all time. Even though he treats her savagely she wants to stay with him. Of course she must return to her home in the evenings. Watching the way Fabrizio terrorizes this sweet girl is not easy. The film takes this route for a while with only these two characters present. The character of Laura is established as the victim And Fabrizio is the abusive and controlling bully. Then one day another little girl appears. The dolllike Sylvia is stereotypically beautiful and just too glamourous and sexual for a twelve year old. So much so that it is downright creepy. Sylvia is also arrogant and incredibly vicious in the way that only girls of this age can be. It seems that Fabrizio has met his match in Sylvia and when the two of them join forces the result is utterly sinister. Together they begin a campaign of sheer terror against the hapless Laura who just doesn't get the reason for all the cruelty. And when given the chance to walk away from the increasingly painful situation she doesn't do it choosing instead to stay most likely out of the desperate need to belong and to be accepted by her peers. Laura must stand by and watch the boy she loves have sex with the spiteful Sylvia in one of the films most shocking scenes as Sylvia asks in a sugary sweet voice Don't you wish that it could be you?. In another equally disturbing scene the pair torture and kill a bird by shooting arrows through the creature while again Laura watches in silent horror. More disturbing still is that the scene is not simulated. One thing that makes the film so powerful is the way it constantly swings back and forth between scenes very beautiful such as the kids playing and laughing as pretty music plays before the scenes change into horror. Throughout the film I kept remembering another film similar in theme Lord of the Flies another film which deals with the dark side of children. However Maladolescenza goes further into the theme examining the absolute horror of innocent evil. It is filled with so much disturbing imagery that I was tempted to turn it off. However that would have been impossible The film is morbidly fascinating strangely hypnotic. Notorious for it's depictions of graphic sex and deservedly so. The nudity is explicit and there is not one sex scene that plays without some undercurrent of violence and hostility. The whole thing is violent from start to finish but the violence is mostly in the psychological mind games and power struggles within the group. In one scene the muchabused Laura puts on the pretty dress of Sylvia while the girl is off with Fabrizio and admires herself in a gold mirror also belonging to Sylvia. She poses herself in the same arrogant way wanting so much to be strong to be in the other girls place. Needless to say the film ends in an equally tragic and horrific way. I wanted to dislike this film but it's power cannot be denied. I don't know anything about the filmmaker or what his intentions were. Was he some twisted pervert or a man with a truly dark and brilliant vision? Who knows? I guess the only thing that matters here is the end result a film of extreme power and insight and beauty. Maladolescenza seems to have a profound message concerning the painful experiences of youth. It understands what it is like for a boy Fabrizio's age to be consumed with the conflicting and overwhelming feelings of love lust hate insecurity and terror at the thought of being left alone. I doubt there will ever be another film quite like this unique work. Certainly a milestone in underground cinema that will unfortunately only be seen by a very select few.".

As far as I know the director was never invited to explain what he intended while doing this one. They were very busy inviting him for prosecution... All in all it's not a great movie but is hard to forget once you give it a try due to the haunting atmospherics and perhaps the sexual content like in those old pastoral poems I mentioned before.

I have read elsewhere that it has no plot the acting is poor etc. Remember this was filmed in 1976 and you cannot escape the fact that they are child actors  A subject of great debate when it comes to this film. Essentially this is about all the crazy feelings that can be present during puberty. There is love hate cruelty yearning and ultimately realisation and understanding. Personally I think the actors Lara Wendel and Martin Loeb did a very fine job. Eva Ionesco? I think she may have been there for other reasons. There are some relatively explicit scenes in this film and the viewer should keep in mind that these girls were eleven years old at the time. Although they deal with it in quite an adult manner well it didn't need to be graphic and it is plainly wrong. Martin Loeb plays Fabrizio in my opinion borderline insane. He plays it very well. Lara Wendel plays Laura who is infatuated with Fabrizio she may even believe that she loves him. She brings the softer more caring character to the film. Fabrizio plays some very cruel mind games with her for the most part but there are a few occasions where he almost seems to have feelings for her. Anyway she eventually gives herself to him in a none too romantic situation but true to life is it for anyone first time? It is awkward and fumbling. Then we have the arrival of Sylvia Eva Ionesco. Fabrizio is attracted to her and it seems he has almost met his match in the somewhat aloof and equally cruel Sylvia. The treatment of Laura deteriorates further until Sylvia grows bored of it all at the Summer's end. Fabrizio has other ideas though and this leads to tragedy.".

Laura and Fabrizio explore the forest and discover high in the wooded hills a ruined magic town. Laura is eager to see him after a year apart and she notes he has changed he's sullen and withdrawn and increasingly given to teasing and tormenting her. The sexual tension between them is complicated by Laura's desperate wish to please him and his pleasure in denying her any sort of satisfaction even conversation or a modest kiss.

This gets still worse when he discovers Sylvia in some ways Laura's opposite confident blonde mean and fearless. She and Fabrizio torment Laura some more in increasingly cruel ways threatening to banish her frightening her shooting arrows at her pretending to throw her from a cliff making her serve them and forcing her to watch them have sex. Fabrizio seems to get steadily worse obsessed with living in the forest imploring Sylvia to stay with him.

The movie looks wonderful with gorgeous photography of woods and meadows and ruins and the three young actors are very nice to look at. Wendel is softlooking anxious expectant longingshe's the best actor among them. Loeb is not a petulant adolescent but he seems dissatisfied with things any boy his age would celebrate forever. Ionesco is an odd mixture of radiance and plainness her golden hair all cloudlike and her skin fine but her face is also rather ordinary looking from certain angles and there's something almost unformed and childlike about it though her ease before the camera makes it difficult to spot she was the favourite model for her mother a famous photographer.

	schema:reviewBody "Pier Giuseppe Murgia's Maladolescenza or 'Spielen wir Lieben' caused a great deal of controversy on its 1977 release which is understandable and yet frustrating as the film in itself has a lot more going for it than the media at the time may have picked up on. The acting is strong all round especially from Eva Ionesco the plot is interesting and the characters are welldefined.The film centres around two children Laura and Fabrizio who meet up on holiday every year at the same place. This time they meet however both are reaching the age where sexual awareness creeps in and therein lies the crux of the film. Laura dotes on Fabrizio yet he is distant cold and often downright rude. The two spend time playing in the woods together eventually stumbling upon a deserted 'town' in the forest beneath which is a cave. Fabrizio persuades Laura to have sex with him in this cave. Afterwards he continues to treat Laura poorly yet she cannot seem to leave him alone.Soon after Fabrizio meets another young girl Silvia and the two also form a sexual relationship along with bullying and taunting Laura at one stage chasing her while firing arrows at her. I don't want to give any more of the story away so I'll leave it there.The film in itself had the potential to be an excellent look into the awkwardness of adolescence yet for me it falls short. This is partly due to the sex scenes. While some are tasteful and help to advance the story others are especially towards the end of the film overplayed gratuitous and seedy. I can see how some were necessary for the development of the story but the later shots are uncomfortably lingering with some shots replayed for no apparent reason. It serves to cheapen what could have been a very powerful and innovative approach to a highly taboo subject. As it is I can't help feeling that a little less would have meant a whole lot more.The characters themselves are very interesting. The differences between the two girls are marked Laura starts out with a very young approach to life and ends up the most grownup of the three. Silvia on the other hand enters the film with a very adult demeanour yet has collapsed into prepubescent frailty by the end of the film. Fabrizio seems highly unlikeable and selfassured for the first twothirds of the film yet by the end he is revealed as lonely and desperate which perhaps gives some reasoning to his actions. There are questions which were raised for me such as why Laura continues to go to play with Fabrizio and Silvia after their terrible treatment of her and why she is so attached to Fabrizio in the first place especially as he is neither kind nor friendly to her at any stage in the film. Even at the end she still proclaims she would do anything for him which could be looked at as the folly of youthful love but I feel a better development would have been her rejecting Fabrizio in realisation that he is trapped in loneliness a very fitting punishment for the acts he carried out against her. The locations for the film are beautiful and the direction is well handled. The soundtrack had some cringeworthy moments but no worse or better than most Italian movies of the 70s. Allinall if you are looking for a challenging film and don't mind putting in a little effort there is a lot of food for thought to be had in this film. I so desperately wanted to rate it higher than a 6 but due to the overstatement of the sex scenes the tone became cheap towards the end which diluted the strong start for me. This isn't to say this film is unwatchable quite the opposite but what could if handled carefully and sensitively have been a masterpiece is unfortunately condemned to be considered a cheap attempt at commercialising child pornography. This is a shame as the themes of adolescent politics are ideas we can all relate to and this film could have explored them a lot more intelligently were it not focusing its attention on the baser side of teenage life.".

Maladolescenza never did. In 2002 there was a movie Ken Park that was discussed and been cut due the fact that adolescents were naked in the movie and Adam Chubbuck was in a controversial shot on the cover that was released. But the film wasn't banned because they were over 18 years old. Back in the seventies and especially at the end of that era everything could be done. The rise of the slashers the glory days of sexploitation and the 42nd sleaze. But one thing people couldn't stand the use or abuse of children. They still should be innocent. But some flicks dared the viewer to watch something different. In 1975 The Psychopath came out a story about a looney children's television show host taking revenge when 'his kids' were punished from their parents shown on screen. Beatings with a belt what was normal in the seventies was shown. The movie never got a proper release. 1976 took it a bit further Assault on Precinct 13 came out a girl is shot in her face by an ice cream man. That scene had to been cut out nowadays it's funny in some way then it was a real shocker. 1989 brought us Beware Children at Play. Children are killing adults but the adults take their revenge by killing the children. Never got a proper release and it was spit out by the journalists. But sometimes their was that special one 1976 France brought us Une Vraie Jeune Fille. Charlotte Alexandra played a 14 year old girl going on holiday on a farm with her uncle and aunt. Being bored she starts to exploit her body. One scene was much spoken about she experiments with a worm running on her private parts. The movie was banned but is now available uncut. The age of Charlotte at the time being was never known but she must have been around her twenties. The only thing known was that she was born at the end of the fifties. So she was an adult. One year later GermanItalie brought us Maladolescenza. Again a story about a boy living in his own world and exploiting young girls to examen histheir bodies. Once it was known that it all was shown in an explicit way the movie became banned. There was nudity in it from the two girls only 13 and 11 years old showing their private parts and breasts. The only versions that were available was a cut version of 77 minutes not the full 90 minutes. But the movie had a problem showing young girls explicit it was an ideal movie for pedophiles. Well sought by them all copies were destroyed but of course some people had the full uncut versions. It was almost unavailable full uncut until in 2006 Andreas Bethmann brought out the full uncut on his X Rated Kult label as Spielen Wir Liebe only to be sold in Germany of course that didn't work out and it was banned again. in some countries people went to jail just by buying this flick. There is a lot said about this flick is it childpornography or not. Just let me tell that it was an official release and the two girls were never forced to undress. But still nowadays the word pedophile is a hot item and the movie is still banned. Even on ebay it is on the banned item list. Sometimes it pops up under Spielen Wir Liebe or Puppy Love. And guess what it goes for a lot of money. So far no retailer dares to sell it. Probeply the most hard to get item on the net and at Conventions. All I want to say if you can get a full uncut try to go back in those days were everything was possible. And still their will be voyeurs and pedo's searching for it but it isn't that if you watch a horror you become a killer that if you watch this one that you will go hunting innocent children.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has so much to say about important issues and does it so well in many ways that I really do want to believe it was conceived as a serious work of art and not as a sop to the dirty raincoat brigade. I've read all the reviews here by its stalwart defenders who argue a good case for a unique film but I remain to be fully convinced.Did the production team deliberately court controversy by using so much child nudity or were they genuinely taken aback by the reaction to its release? Western Europe in the 1970s was pretty liberal about such things and still is by American standards thank God! but even so the boundaries of mainstream films must have been pushed back quite a bit with Maladolescenza. Arguing that so much footage of pubescent sex was essential to the artistic integrity of the whole would have been difficult even then. Nowadays the film couldn't possibly be made which is probably a good thing overall simply because in my view young children should not be sexualised for the benefit of adults. However in the case of Maladolescenza although the girl actors were only 11 or 12 I think you would find it pretty difficult to assert that they were exploited or harmed in any way judging from a cursory look at their filmographies though I am open to persuasion otherwise by anyone who really knows.So what we have is a curiosity from another age and it's really rather good. The controversy over its content which has made it so notorious and which attracted my attention in the first place and no doubt many others' will rage forever but beyond all that it's a pretty convincing study of adolescent torment and suffering. The locations are stunning and the three young actors are quite beautiful highlighting all the more the psychological and physical torture they inflict on each other which is achingly well portrayed and well acted. The film is shocking in its portrayal of children's cruelty more so than any other I can think of even Lord of the Flies. This is clearly deliberate yet the shock value is compounded by the sex scenes  also intentional of course but necessary to the whole? Sex is clearly integral to the power games being played out by the kids and again this is a convincing aspect of the plot as a whole. Kids really do behave like that you deny it at your peril and a shiver went down my spine as I recalled my own youth  so the film worked in this way for me. It's challenging and that's good. I just recoil a little from seeing so much young flesh in such sexual situations. There's nothing wrong with nudity yes even child nudity and nothing wrong with sex but combine the two and you cross the line at some point and I think this film does even though it's tastefully done and certainly not what I'd call child porn. That's my take on it from my English standpoint. But sorry righteous Christians and outraged moralists I don't reckon I'll burn in hell for watching and enjoying it and I'd far rather live in a society that permits eccentricities like this than your prurient paradise.So yes it's uncomfortable and challenging viewing on many levels and on these terms the film is undoubtedly successful. It obviously sickens the prudish and although I can understand why that actually contributes to its appeal for me. Ban it? Never! You don't have to watch it and neither do I but I am strangely attracted by its power and sheer oddity. Flaws yes plenty of course it's no masterpiece. The ending is daft for one the dog pretty pointless for another when it's around which is not much. There also seem to be one or two nonsequiturs in the narrative flow which may suggest some hasty editing some sources give the original film length as 117 or 127 minutes whereas the uncut version generally in circulation today only runs to around 91 minutes. But hopefully it will survive as a controversial cult classic for those of us with a taste for the weird and a reminder of better times when the sight of a naked child did not automatically lead to mass hysteria from the selfrighteous moral brigade across the pond.Overall verdict  Great no. Darned good yes. Shocking oh yes. Just don't try and do it again!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a story about three young kids two girls Lara and Sylvia 12 and one boy Fabrizio 18 who have some very interesting and intense personal interactions during a summer vacation. They are the only characters in the movie. The setting is a remote forested and hillymountainous area adjacent to a very small community.Lara met Fabrizio for the first time the previous summer. She has been looking forward to seeing him again. They had agreed to meet again and Lara had wondered if Fabrizio would forget.When they meet and get some things they stashed away the previous summer Lara notices that Fabrizio has changed seemingly a bit more distant and different in some way and he keeps looking at her in a different way he notices her budding sexuality. She sort of feels a little bit differently about him too but thinks it's a good feeling. And she feels that he can see right into her and knows what she is thinking which somewhat unnerves her.But Fabrizio also seems to have turned meaner and more abrupt towards Lara first being nice and then pushing her away. He wants her to play some of the games and fun things and then he wants her to get lost and not bother him. She alternates between being happy having fun to crying and wondering what's going on. It's confusing for Lara but she likes him regardless.After several days they go into a cave they found. Fabrizio wants to explore it but Lara is afraid. After traveling a ways in Fabrizio pretends to be lost not able to find his way out. Lara is scared and cold. Fabrizio comforts and holds her backing up to the wall of the cave. They both slowly sink down to the ground Lara remaining in Fabrizo's embrace. After a moment Fabrizio starts removing her jacket and reaches for the buttons on her blouse. She asks what he's doing. He says he wants to see her body. Saying nothing more she acquiesces and gazes intently into his eyes while he proceeds to remove her blouse. He removes all her clothes and then gently rubs his hands over her breasts and caresses them while she gently gasps and breathes erratically. He removes his clothes and she says to be gentle with her. He assures her that he will. Before he has intercourse with her he goes down on her. Lara says it feels warm and good. Frabrizio then moves himself on top of Lara and has intercourse. At first she says it hurts but quickly gets over that and is shown rubbing Fabrizio's hair and enjoying his lovemaking. Shortly afterward it fades out of their lovemaking scene.That is probably the gentlest and sweetest scene of all the nudesexual scenes because of the superb acting and the showing of emotions and facial expressions during lovemaking. It shows Fabrizio at his gentlest as opposed to other times. So there is a contrast with Fabrizio seemingly from one moment to the next and one time to another time.Sylvia is the stranger there not having been there the prior year and Fabrizio wants to know who she is when he sees her for the first time. Lara is a beautiful girl and while Sylvia is also she is stunningly so a beautiful looking blond with long hair. However right away Sylvia is shown to be a very stuck up and selfassured girl at least on the surface. Lara is a sweet and innocent girl while Sylvia appears to be neither.Fabrizio gets Lara to convince Sylvia to play with them when he finds he can't persuade Sylvia. He does this by pretending to be mad at Lara about something which is common with him and then saying that he'll forgive her if she gets Sylvia to play with them.Lara does convince Sylvia and almost immediately Sylvia displaces Lara in terms of Fabrizio's attentions. The abrupt and mean streak that Fabrizio has is accentuated by the stuckup and selfassured nature of Sylvia and they both turn on Lara and make her life miserable first being friends and then making her a slave to their whims and wishes. Lara endures it patiently although crying at times while she still has feelings for Fabrizio. We can see the look on Lara's face at times either disappointed or sad or stunned or frightened  all because of the games that Fabrizio and Sylvia play on her. Lara even has her doubts about herself but still remains steadfastly in love with Fabrizio even while constantly hurt.One absolutely shocking moment for Lara and for the audience is when Lara stumbles upon Fabrizio and Sylvia both of them completely nude and playing around with each other. Lara is stunned absolutely stunned as she had been with Fabrizio just like that in the cave. Both Fabrizio and Sylvia show no shame or remorse or contrition but absolutely boast in showing off to Lara what they are doing making this all the more stunning and shocking.Sylvia looks at Lara with a very proud look saying that she knows that Lara wishes she were with Fabrizio like she is at that very moment and with glaring eyes towards Lara grabs Fabrizio's head and pushes it down to her vagina and lays back down to enjoy herself. Lara is shocked stunned and extremely hurt all of which you can see on her face. She turns to walk off but Fabrizio commands her to stay and sit just a few feet from them and watch them. Lara obeys and sits down. Fabrizio then proceeds to have intercourse with Sylvia with Lara a mere few feet away watching. Both Sylvia and Fabrizio look over at Lara occasionally to make sure she's watching and sneer at her.The scene changes with Lara leaning her head towards a tree and quietly sobbing.more if I can post later...".

The abrupt and mean streak that Fabrizio has is accentuated by the stuckup and selfassured nature of Sylvia and they both turn on Lara and make her life miserable first being friends and then making her a slave to their whims and wishes. Lara endures it patiently although crying at times while she still has feelings for Fabrizio. We can see the look on Lara's face at times either disappointed or sad or stunned or frightened  all because of the games that Fabrizio and Sylvia play on her. Lara even has her doubts about herself but still remains steadfastly in love with Fabrizio even while constantly hurt.One absolutely shocking moment for Lara and for the audience is when Lara stumbles upon Fabrizio and Sylvia both of them completely nude and playing around with each other. Lara is stunned absolutely stunned as she had been with Fabrizio just like that in the cave. Both Fabrizio and Sylvia show no shame or remorse or contrition but absolutely boast in showing off to Lara what they are doing making this all the more stunning and shocking.Sylvia looks at Lara with a very proud look saying that she knows that Lara wishes she were with Fabrizio like she is at that very moment and with glaring eyes towards Lara grabs Fabrizio's head and pushes it down to her vagina and lays back down to enjoy herself. Lara is shocked stunned and extremely hurt all of which you can see on her face. She turns to walk off but Fabrizio commands her to stay and sit just a few feet from them and watch them. Lara obeys and sits down. Fabrizio then proceeds to have intercourse with Sylvia with Lara a mere few feet away watching. Both Sylvia and Fabrizio look over at Lara occasionally to make sure she's watching and sneer at her.The scene changes with Lara leaning her head towards a tree and quietly sobbing.more if I can post later...";

Together the Sonderkommandos struggled to organize the only armed revolt that would ever take place at Auschwitz. As the rebellion is about to commence a group from the unit discovers a 14yearold girl who has miraculously survived a gassing.

	schema:reviewBody "Many Holocaust films present the ethical dilemna of trying to stay alive at the cost of allowing others to die or even sending others to their death. A few films might focus on the dreaded Kapos in the camps  or on the elitist Jewish Council members who helped organize the transport groups  or on the musiciansperformers who entertained the Nazis  all of whom hoped that they would be allowed to survived.  But this film focuses on the Sonderkommandos  the special workers  who ushered Jewish victims to the gas chambers and burned the bodies.  They too hoped to survive.  But they must have known that they were going to be murdered eventually if only because they had become the most dangerous witnesses to the cold Nazi horror.  And the film begins by informing us that these groups of Sonderkommandos were never allowed to live longer than four months.There are several reasons you must see this film.  First it is based on the diary of Dr. Miklos Nyiszli a Hungarian Jew chosen by Josef Mengele to be the head pathologist at Auschwitz.  And it dramaticizes the true attempt by Sonderkommandos to destroy the Auschwitz gas chambers.Second it focuses on ethical dilemnas faced by Dr. Nyiszli and the various Sonderkommandos who are trying to save themselves their families or ... just someone ... anyone.  To say that these men were coopted by the Nazis is to ignore the horror of the coercion debasement and dehumanization that the Nazis inflicted  not only on their prisoners but upon themselves. One can imagine that some Sonderkommandos were selfish  just as some Kapos were cruel and some doctors who assisted the Nazis were accomplices.  But the question remains  what would you have done in the face of such coercion and duress?Third the film  based on Tim Blake Nelson's play  is not the typical Holocaust film.  There is very little redeeming behavior.  There is no uplifting ending.  The grey zone of moral ambiguity is presented as a cold unfeeling horrifying place  where you are damned if you do and damned if you don't  which means that they are all damned!  For the first third of the film the script is obtuse confusing and disconnecting  as it should be considering that we may as well be taking the point of view of someone who just arrived on a train and entered the gates of hell.  How can any of this make sense?  In the opening scene the Doctor is asked to save the life of a Jew who attempted suicide.  How absurd can that be  to save the life of someone who will sooner rather than later be murdered by the Nazis anyway?!In conclusion the playfilm contains dialogue and scenes that are memorable.  This is one of my favorites.  One Jewish leader is demanding that they destroy the gas chambers as soon as possible.  But another Jewish leader is still planning on escape arguing that he has every right to expect to live.  The first leader replies something to the effect that after what he has seen and done he does not want to live!Today is Holocaust Memorial Day April 18 2004.  Last night after seeing a Holocaust documentary on Kurt Gerron Prisoner of Paradise a friend of mine asked me what I would have done?  I told her that it would depend on whom I was caring for  my wife and my daughters  my parents.  It was then that I realized that I would have probably done everything that every Jew did during the Holocaust.  I would have tried to save myself and my family.  I would have abandoned others  even betrayed others.  I would have killed.  I would have fought the Nazis.  And I would have probably been killed for it.  I would have despaired  tried suicide  become depressed useless to everyone.  I don't think I would have survived.  I think the only question in that regard  and it shows how irrelevant the question really is  is how soon would I have died.  That is why I remember Holocaust Memorial Day  so that I will never forget  and I can help work towards a time when such a hell will not occur in Europe in Africa in the Middle East in the US ... anywhere.".

Never forget that Auschwitz is where the rule of law decency and normality ceased to apply. This movie will not make you feel good so don't expect it too...it is not its intent to present a happy victorious story. Its intent is to show those who have not lived through or visited Auschwitz just a small part of the horror of everyday existence the juxtaposition of what may be right and what you would do for another day of life. Having seen the cells in Block XI having seen the womens camp having stood in the remaining gas chamber and crematoria at Auschwitz I I can assure you that this movie does its best to do justice to the memory of those who died.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the second film from writerdirectoractor Tim Blake Nelson to disappear into film limbo. Known for his leading role in O Brother Where Art Thou he also wrote and directed O which was shelved after the Columbine massacre. It has taken 3 years for The Grey Zone to arrive on Australian shores and it has now gone straight to video. This is a great shame as this is a stunning film worthy of far more attention. It is the true story of the Sonderkommando groups in Auschwitz the most infamous of all Nazi concentration camps. The Sonderkommandos were Jewish prisoners who volunteered to work on the gas chambers and furnaces in exchange for better treatment and extended life. No team ever lasted more than 4 months and would themselves be added to the groups herded into the gas chamber by the next sonderkommando group. This is the tale of the 12th group who used their position to revolt against the Nazis and blow up the two primary gas chambersfurnaces. There are many flaws within the film the dialogue feels too much like a play which makes the discussions somewhat static everybody has an American accent except for Harvey Keitel who somehow manages to sound like Mel Brooks impersonating a German and the details of how they select Sonderkommandos and their lifestyles are not very well dealt with. However these faults do very little to diminish the power of this film. For above all else this is a story that not only succeeds in answering the question of why Jews would volunteer for such a duty but also allows the viewer a stunning and horrifying look into human psychology and the politics of oppression. While a film like Schindler's List allows us a broader view of the overall situation it failed to truly give any insight into the individuals who allowed the machines of war to keep operating. How could people not rise up and at least to try fight knowing they were going to die anyway? The Grey Zone gives the viewer a very clear and very painful view of the weakness within humanity of how humans allow themselves to be convinced that everything will be ok no matter what evidence we have in front of us. In telling the story of the one uprising to occur within the most destructive of all concentration camps we get to show the good in man and the evil. And in this the film succeeds above many other films and is worthy of praise far surpassing the melodramatic tripe that Hollywood usually tries to feed us in regards to the second world war. And in our current political climate it is more important than ever to understand how easily we fall back on our ability to turn a blind eye and believe the lies that even our next door neighbour will tell us.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had a hard time getting to sleep after watching The Grey Zone. It is the darkest film I have ever seen. It is a stark contrast to Schindler's List in the fact that it is focused on the experience of the great majority of the people who were sent to the death camps and died. Nobody helped them. It is also raw in its presentation of the gas chambers crematoria and the Sonderkommandos Jews who volunteered to do the dirty work of processing the people who arrived at the camps and then their dead bodies afterwards in exchange for a few more months of life.That takes nothing away from the extraordinary Schindler's List as it is very important to show the deeds of people like Oskar Schindler. His story and the story of many others like him is also true. In my opinion watching both films makes for an effective portrayal of the Holocaust on film and an exploration of the nature of evil and humanity.Although the Grey Zone is a bleak story of utter human depravity the darkness is not total. In an extraordinary turn of events that actually happened in October 1944 the very people who at first abandoned their morality to keep themselves alive threw the Nazis' deal back in their faces and sacrificed themselves taking a part of the Auschwitz death factory with them. Their actions suggest that even though it flickers the eternal flame that makes us greater than what we may appear to be is always present within.".

	schema:headline " The ultimate picture about the Holocaust a true horror movie and a true ten!";
	schema:reviewBody "During the last days of World War II as the soviets' bombs explode closer and closer as the days go by the routine of concentration camp Awschwitz follows its course and represents the focus of this picture the atmosphere of dread and death inhabiting the heavy air the work inside the crematorium the random executions of men women and childrenand the drama of the Jewish sonderkommando a group formed by prisoners who in exchange of better food and clothes helped their tormentors in the systematic of death inside the camps guiding the new arrived prisoners through the corridors that lead to the gas chambers and the disposal of the bodies after wards just to be killed some time latter. Let me just say this right from the get go The Grey Zone is the finest ultimate grittiest portrayal of the Holocaust in all its ugliness and horror. On the fact that The Grey Zone is highly underrated and little known is a complete mystery for me. Where Schindler's List bravely portrayed the dark events that went around in Germany circa 1940's it was built towards the light towards an uplifting ending where hope prevails and courageous acts save the day. The Grey Zone instead offers no hope or alternative nor uplifting ways nor any of the characters show any noble redeeming actions towards their fellow inmates. Ultimately it's about survival and how we get our morals lost so easily when the instinct to stay alive kicks in. The Grey Zone's ugliness packs one hard punch  never in any other movie death was shown in such a realistic brutal light. You actually fell you're inside the corridors of the crematorium it's like you're trapped inside these tiny claustrophobic gas chambers it's like the putrid smell of the dead yellow corpses piled up on the floor and the dread gets under your skin and stays there for days.Tim Blake Nelson was at the helm of The Grey Zone and what a masterful filmmaker Mr. Nelson is...The sense of dread and dark tonalities of The Grey Zone put David Cronenberg to the shame. It should be regarded not as a movie but as an experience.The script is tight and sober reminded me of David Mamet in his most inspiring moments regarding the dialogs and the exchanges between the characters. The photography and art department deserve praise Awschwitz was worse than hell and people who visit these old concentration camps tend to say that after wards they fell this aura of pain and sadness. With Tim Blake Nelson's picture although you're not physically there The Grey Zone works as a tour through this place worse than hell. It is as creepy as the creepiest film can get trust me.Performances here are all top notch and career defining. What really hurts is that The Grey Zone didn't get its deserved attention because it poignantly proved what some movie stars are capable of given the right material David Arquette an actor known for light comedies is strikingly magnetic as the most fragile mentally weakened sonderkommando and his scenes are nothing short than harrowing and visceral. The moment when he is confronted by a newcomer prisoner about to be guided to the gas chamber is the stuff of cinematic history in terms of acting as Arquette tells his lies you'll be guided to the bath and soon will be reunited with your family and so on this scared newcomer realizing his fate confronts him and says It's a lie I can't believe it's Jews doing this job!I'm going to die but I'm going to live longer than you ever will you're dead already!! the desperate prisoner shouts at Arquette and then Arquette loses his head and attacks this man to death breaking his skull with punches and kicks not really moved by angriness but by sorrow and pain to recognize the awfulness of the truth spit on his face  yes even him Arquette can't believe he is doing this and the outlet of such sorrow comes into the forms of him losing his head and degrading and smashing a fellow Jew's skull to the death. Such a scary harrowing movie moment... Mira Sorvino was a joy and be prepared you won't recognize her at first. The depths this wonderful actress went to create her character in a realistic light should be applauded. Mrs. Sorvino was highly commended for her work in Woody Allen's 1995 movie but her performance in The Grey Zone rises above her other work that's the picture Mrs. Sorvino should be recognized and awarded for.The other members of the cast have my respect but I wanted to specifically point the performances of Sorvino and Arquette as the picture's true highlight in terms of acting. It was a crime that Lions Gate didn't work hard to promote this powerful material. The Grey Zone is a must see and a must have a tour de force with performances for the ages and top notch cinematic achievements in every single department. A true ten as exciting as films can get!!".

The moment when he is confronted by a newcomer prisoner about to be guided to the gas chamber is the stuff of cinematic history in terms of acting as Arquette tells his lies you'll be guided to the bath and soon will be reunited with your family and so on this scared newcomer realizing his fate confronts him and says It's a lie I can't believe it's Jews doing this job!I'm going to die but I'm going to live longer than you ever will you're dead already!! the desperate prisoner shouts at Arquette and then Arquette loses his head and attacks this man to death breaking his skull with punches and kicks not really moved by angriness but by sorrow and pain to recognize the awfulness of the truth spit on his face  yes even him Arquette can't believe he is doing this and the outlet of such sorrow comes into the forms of him losing his head and degrading and smashing a fellow Jew's skull to the death. Such a scary harrowing movie moment... Mira Sorvino was a joy and be prepared you won't recognize her at first. The depths this wonderful actress went to create her character in a realistic light should be applauded. Mrs. Sorvino was highly commended for her work in Woody Allen's 1995 movie but her performance in The Grey Zone rises above her other work that's the picture Mrs. Sorvino should be recognized and awarded for.The other members of the cast have my respect but I wanted to specifically point the performances of Sorvino and Arquette as the picture's true highlight in terms of acting. It was a crime that Lions Gate didn't work hard to promote this powerful material. The Grey Zone is a must see and a must have a tour de force with performances for the ages and top notch cinematic achievements in every single department. A true ten as exciting as films can get!!";

Good cast with Harvey Keitel Mira Sorvino Steve Buscemi and an impressive performance for a change by David Arquette. Arquette chose a very serious rolea Jewish prisoner at a Nazi concentration camp and played it off well.This is based on a true story about a group of Jewish concentration camp inmates at Auschwitz that plan on smuggling in dynamite to blow up one of the crematoriums. Their plan gets discovered by the SS and killings and torture run rampant to try and get them to confess and give details of their plans. A teenage girl happens to survive one of the gassings and the camp inmates become obsessed with saving her even though it could be at the expense of many lives.  There were some people that saw this movie because they couldn't get in to see Frida. Some people had no idea what this movie was about before they saw it. Some people asked me before it started and I told them and they still chose to stay. If you are a history buff and like Holocaust movies and want to see a true story told through the eyes of the writers you might like this movie but be prepared to see endless killings working around a decent script that could have been better written. However if you can appreciate the fact that the makers are trying to educate people on the Holocaust and bring to light just how cruel and horrible Hitler's Third Reich was the movie is sad depressing but does have some educational value. Not every single Jew willingly accepted what was going to happen to them a few tried to rebel and that's why this story was told.Not very easy on the eyes bring the Kleenex and watch with shock as one of history's most horrible atrocities is brought to the screen.710.".

It is not meant to be a tearjerker or a film on the level of Schindler's List especially since it does not tell the same story. What it does tell is the brutal reality of the only armed revolt staged by the Jews in Birkenau the extermination camp attached to Auschwitz. The Sonderkommando Special Detail were the prisoners that were forced to assist in the annihilation of their own people by taking the bodies from the gas chambers to the crematoria. In order to keep their crimes against humanity a secret the SS liquidated each Sonderkommando every six weeks. This is the story of a group that stashed away weapons and explosives and revolted just before they were scheduled to be liquidated.After having read Eyewitness Auschwitz written by a member of the Sonderkommando and Auschwitz A Doctor's Eyewitness Account by the completely selfabsorbed doctor in reality not the movie upon which this film is based I'm glad this project was undertaken. It is a wellmade movie that tries to portray too many of the complicated issues that involved with the subject. It has received some harsh criticism especially by some who claim to be interested in the subject but obviously missed many points in the movie. Since I don't know of any other films about the revolt of the twelfth Sonderkommando of Birkenau I think this one is very good.One final note Some people seem to think that the title refers to some moral dilemma faced by the characters. While that certainly was an issue for some who were there and while the movie title may convey a double meaning the main reason Birkenau was referred to as the Grey Zone was due to the coating of ash from burned human corpses that covered everything including those who lived and worked there. It was on the ground on the buildings and on their clothing. They literally ate and breathed it 24 hours a day.".

The true story was one that I wasn't familiar with the rebellion of a group of Jews at a Nazi concentration camp. The jacket of the DVD placed the focus of the movie on the rebellion but that was a bit misleading. The bulk of the story had much more to do with the mindset of collaboration than with the rebellion which really received very little focus until the end of the movie.In this film we learn about the Sonderkommandos  groups of Jews who helped the Nazis maintain order at the concentration camps in exchange for a few extra privileges and a few extra months of life. The look at the mindset of collaboration was fascinating. The sonderkommandos are  understandably  looked down on by the rest of the Jews the sonderkommandos themselves have some definite moral qualms about their work and  in spite of their own collaboration with the Nazis  they are definitely antagonistic toward Dr. Nyiszli Allan Corduner a Jewish doctor who gets even more privileges by cooperating in Nazi medical experiments on some of the captives. They're Jews who just don't fit in with the victims of the Holocaust although they too will become its victims and yet even though they help the Nazis they obviously don't fit in to that circle either. Their existence was lived in a true grey zone in other words. This is a troubling story in many ways as surely any movie about the Holocaust should be! with some scenes being quite graphic.And yet somehow the  movie didn't keep me glued to the screen. It was interesting but really not more than that and I had hoped to learn more about the rebellion itself which was passed over rather quickly I thought. For those interested in the subject it's worth watching but certainly not a masterpiece.610".

Inevitably such a subject matter raises the question of to what lengths the viewer would go in order to stay alive and the cost to the people who found themselves capable of colluding with their captors. When one new arrival to Auschwitz ferried straight from the train to the shower's changing room loudly challenges Hoffman David Arquette over his and his friend's breezy instructions to remember the number of the hook on which they hang their clothes so that they can find them after the shower Hoffman beats him to a bloody pulp  as if for forcing him to confront what he is doing to his people. Despite this the performances are subdued for the most part the prisoner's attitudes to their situation almost matteroffact. Given fine food and alcohol in payment for their work they live in ivory towers that have been stained by human ashes.The survival of a young girl after showering in the Nazi's deadly gas just as the men are preparing to stage their revolt triggers an emotional crisis amongst the members of the unit with some insisting she be killed for their protection and others demanding she be allowed to live. They face a dilemma that is mirrored by those of the German soldiers who mill around the girl uncertainly after the protesters have all been killed. There is a line beyond which even those who have grown almost inhumanly inured to killing will hesitate to step. The girl alone and defenceless unlike the masses herded into the showers forces them to put a face to their victims and ejects them from their oddly cocooned existence.The film is an adaptation of a stage play apparently and this fact is evident in the dialogue which sometimes seems unreal as if the speakers are somehow detached from the emotions they are supposed to be feeling. This may be deliberate another example of the tamping down of their true emotions but its sometimes distracting. Despite this the performances are good especially that of Harvey Keitel who seems to grow into the part of the German officer who knows he has lost touch with everything that made him human.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a horrible shallow manipulative movie.  Tim Blake Nelson is good at playing the goofy stupid guys and the way this movie is directed you'd think that maybe it's less of an act that you thought.  When adapting any play to the big screen occasionally one can run into the problem of wordiness and scenes that go on too long.  Every scene in this movie goes on waaay too long and every conversation is painfully stretched to the breaking point.  And the dialogue itself which due to the extremely constructed interruptions from one character on to another always seems to be artificial even though ironically Tim wanted to use the effect to create realism.  The dialogue and the scenes are sloppily written and incredibly unsubtle and on the nose.  The characters are made to sound like Mamet creations but the writer here only shows his pretension and his lack of talent.  And overall the worst thing about this movie is the fact that it uses violence in the movie to manipulate and to exploit the people. After every very long boring scene between two guys usually one of which is Harvey Keitel doing the most embarrassing German accent one is likely to ever hear there is a violent scene.  The violent scene may be Jews going into the showers a Jew being beaten for his watch Jews being lines up and shot etc.  If one looks at the movie they'll see that these scenes were put into the film so that the viewer would sympathize with the film and perhaps forget about the intensely boring scene that preceded this one.  These violent scenes only want you to believe that this is a better film than it actually is and it stoops to the lowest level to do so.  It's not surprising that Nelson says there was no violence or anything in his stage play this explains why these scenes seem so tacked on.  And when the film is just about to end before you can think of how unaffecting and poorly done it was we get an extraordinarily sentimental intensely manipulative voiceover of a dead Holocaust girl describing what it was like to have her body burned to dust inside the ovens.  This is pandering filmmaking.  If I made a short film about a learning disabled boy had him get shot in the head and then had a voiceover in which he cries I didn't want to die I wasn't too smart but I never wanted this to happen.  Where's my mommy I'm scared mommy'  The audience would be affected but this is exploitative and horrible manipulative filmmaking.  This is what Tim Blake Nelson does here with of all things the Holocaust.  It's a shame because it seems like the actual story of The Grey Zone had something important to say.  It's too bad that Tim Blake Nelson read the book before a better more honest director could have a chance.".

There were many themes that really demanded they be fleshed out the intense animosities between some of the different nationalities how the whole sabotage plot got started the whole briberysmuggling thing that went on to get around the guards etc. but were not addressed in any detail.  Only the incident with the girl who survived the gassing was addressed in any detail. Yet that entire incident seemed somewhat out of place when you saw how the key characters interacted with the doomed Jews and their very clear realization of their own impending deaths.  There were some real stories to be told in this film to put it mildly.  They just weren't told.I guess I'd give it a rating of 23 out of 5.  It certainly was visually compelling.  I think if they had really told the story of the planned sabotage attempt from start to finish allowing us to learn about the characters as we went through this film may have really succeeded.  I know many people really diminish Steven Spielberg's work because it popularizes material that might warrant a more critical examination. But the man knows how to tell a storyhold your attention and leave a memory. It's been years since Schindler's List but I still have some very vivid memories of that film that resonated.

That's the fault of the script taken from David Mamet's play and other eyewitness sourcesbut the acting is excellent.And yet it does manage to convey just how those prison camps used other prisoners to operate the gas chambers to carry out the deed with false promisesJust be sure to remember where you hook the clothes so you can pick up your belongings when you leaveand the backbreaking jobs of loading trucks with dead bodies and depositing them on chutes that go directly into a blazing furnace. Amid all this various stories are entwined involving the petty quarrels among the men assigned to these tasks so they could prolong their own lives for at least four months of assured survival.The story involving a girl who does not die during the twentyminute gassing and is then revived and how the men argue over how to protect her from further harm is intense and touching in that it shows the humanity that is still in their souls. Her story and how it ends is one of the film's most memorable and touching elements.This is more of an in depth look at the final solution than any other recent films dealing with the extermination of Jews has ever been with the exception of SCHINDLER'S LIST and THE PIANIST in which the accent was more on the triumph of the human spirit and a much broader view of the war itself in epic mode.This is a darker intimate look at the actual operation of the camps as experienced by a handful of prisonersthe brutality the torture and raises the question how far would you go to survive? It also shows how not all the Jews were as passive about their fate as some have claimed often opposing the Nazi officers and paying for it with their lives.In the hands of a greater director it might have been an even more impressive film than it is so that I'm unable to place it in the same class with the two films mentioned above. The cast is uniformly good but HARVEY KEITEL is outstanding as an SS Commander keeping strict tabs on the camp's hardworking doctor.In its own way it's just as important. Young students of history would be well advised to view this one for a better understanding of how the final solution was supposed to occur and the methods used to carry out an enormous project known as the holocaust.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the wake of World War I German film was sharply influenced by expressionism an arts movement which is less concerned with imitating reality than in using design to reflect psychology and emotion. THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI brought the style to the screen in 1919 and throughout the 1920s many directors would create projects under its influence.German director Paul Leni 18851929 was one suchand although he is best recalled for his later Hollywood films most notably the stylish THE CAT AND THE CANARY the 1924 German WAXWORKS shows him very near the peak of gifts. It is also very clearly an homage of sorts to THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI not only would Leni cast two of that film's actors in major roles he drew from the film's style for both sets and cinematography.WAXWORKS is an anthology film a collection of stories bound together by a running thread. A young writer William Dieterle is employed by a carnival sideshow wax museum to write stories about several of their figures a Baghdad Caliph Ivan the Terrible and Spring Heeled Jack. As he writes the film segues into the story the writer invents.The longest of the three stories concerns Harun al Raschid a Caliph of Baghdad who falls in love with a baker's wifeand then seeks to take her for his own. Featuring the celebrated Emil Jannings as the Caliph the episode is a mixture of light comedy and Arabian Nights fantasy particularly noted for the greatly stylized sets that recall the earlier CALIGARI and THE GOLEM to somewhat softer effect. It also offers the very rare opportunity to see Jannings famed for his dramatic roles in comic mode and he proves equally adept with this bit of fluff as with his more serious work.The second episode is a fantasy suggested by Russian ruler Ivan the Terrible who delights in poisoning prisoners but finds himself fearful of his highly gifted poisonmixer. Ivan is played by Conrad Veidt who appeared as the murderous Cesare in CALIGARI one of Germany's most popular actors of the silent screen Veidt was also noted for his gift at playing insanity and his Ivan is the very incarnation of madness. As in the earlier episode the sets are also fantastic although perhaps not so obviously so.Fine though the first two sequences are it is really the last that is most famous and justly so. Here Leni sets the story against the carnival itself and presents it in grotesque dreamlike images that very deliberately recall CALIGARI moreover he casts actor William Dieterle who played Caligari himself as a menacing killer who slowly stalks his terrified victims. The killer is referred to as both Spring Heeled Jack and Jack the Ripper clearly however he is more akin to the latter. The cinematography in this sequence is particularly fine using multiple exposures in a way that foreshadows Leni's stylish THE CAT AND THE CANARY.In an overall sense WAXWORKS is quite fine and were it not for the fact the final sequence is so short I would easily give it a full five stars. The Kino DVD also offers a very good transfer complete with original tinting unfortunately however it offers no bonus material except a Leni shortan unexpected but mildly interesting filmed crossword puzzle. Although some may find the anthology nature of the film a bit offputting silent fans will likely love WAXWORKS from start to finish.GFT Amazon Reviewer".

	onyx:emotionText "In the wake of World War I German film was sharply influenced by expressionism an arts movement which is less concerned with imitating reality than in using design to reflect psychology and emotion. THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI brought the style to the screen in 1919 and throughout the 1920s many directors would create projects under its influence.German director Paul Leni 18851929 was one suchand although he is best recalled for his later Hollywood films most notably the stylish THE CAT AND THE CANARY the 1924 German WAXWORKS shows him very near the peak of gifts. It is also very clearly an homage of sorts to THE CABINET OF DR.

The first part about Haroun al Rashid played by Emil Jannings is very humorous and funny as well with well written plot. The second part about Ivan the Terrible played by Conrad Veidt is in contrast very dark and depressing. In my humble opinion it is much better than Eisenstein's movie which also steals shamelessly from it for sure Veidt is better than Cherkasov. The third story is something really weird it starts and suddenly ends like the crew ran out of money.So a lot of humour in the first part a lot of Russian gothic  in the second part good acting good plot great sets  if you like silent movies especially expressionist silent movies don't miss this one!P.S. If you like silent movies and still haven't seen Cabinet of Doctor Kaligari and Nosferatu symphony of horror see them first  they are better than Waxworks!".

The expressionistic stylization in the film is obviously influenced by Caligari and a few references to that film reinforces that beginning with the title. The literal translation of Das Wachsfigurenkabinett is The Wax Figures Cabinetthe keyword being cabinet. Additionally the frame narrative is purposefully set at a carnival although a more dimensional one than the stage setting in Caligari.The narrative structure is closer to Fritz Lang's Destiny 1921 with the framing of three odd stories. Waxworks has the clever device of a writer of the inner stories in the framing story. And the three biggest stars of Weimer cinema Emil Jannings Conrad Veidt and Werner Krauss play the historical villains and waxworks come alive in the inner stories. For the three stories a different expressionistic technique dominates each relating to and enhancing their respective themes. In the Harus al Raschid narrative featuring Jannings it's the sets Paul Leni's sphere with oddly shaped architecture more akin to Caligari' than Baghdad. Especially nice is the staircase set. Rather than the horrific dreamlike abstraction of Caligari however the sets are delightfully peculiar as is Jannings and the silly story. Lowkey lighting dominates the Ivan the Terrible episode featuring a darkly paranoid Veidt and the multiple exposure kaleidoscope imagery places Krauss's stalking serial killer everywhere.A clever film and Leni and the other filmmakers seem to have had fun with it which crosses over to viewers but beyond that it's rather lackluster not emotionally engaging as Destiny nor stunningly fresh as Caligari.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's only when you begin to delve deeper into works of German Expressionism that you can appreciate how important and influential a film was 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari 1920.' It demonstrated to filmmakers and audiences that cinema is an inherently artificial medium and so rather than striving for realism films should emphasise the fake and fantastic elements of their story. Though Frenchman Georges Mlis had first struck on this idea at the turn of the twentieth century it was Robert Wiene's creative horror film that established German Expressionism as the defining artistic style of the 1920s securing postWar Germany as cinema's most prominent innovator and paving the way for directors F.W. Murnau Fritz Lang and Paul Leni each of whom were later coaxed to Hollywood to share their expertise. The hand of 'Caligari' is evident throughout 'Das Wachsfigurenkabinett  Waxworks 1924' a fantasyhorror that is framed around a young writer's attempt to concoct thrilling tales to accompany three carnival waxwork characters  Harun al Raschid Ivan the Terrible and Jack the Ripper.Three names come to mind more readily than most when one considers silent German actors Conrad Veidt 'The Man Who Laughs 1928' Werner Krauss 'Herr Tartff 1925' and of course Emil Jannings 'Faust 1926'. It's no surprise that both Veidt and Krauss had achieved their stardom with 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' four years earlier and the parallels between that film and 'Waxworks' stretch much further than the mere casting decisions. The film codirected by Paul Leni and Leo Birinsky employs grosslyexaggerated art direction the sets designed by Leni himself and Helmar Lerski's imaginativelywarped cinematography to highlight the fantasy in each story even though there are very few elements that would ordinarily be considered fantastic. Emil Jannings plays the rotund Harun al Raschid the fifth Abbasid Caliph with a loathsome repugnance that gradually gives way to a certain likability. When his intentions towards the beautiful Maimune Olga Belajeff are shown to be friendly rather than sexual he becomes an affable and cartoonish oaf.This segment is followed by the story of Ivan the Terrible Conrad Veidt who is driven to madness by the trickle of sand through an hourglass every falling grain bringing him closer to demise. Veidt plays the cruel Grand Prince of Moscow with a wideeyed craziness that calls to mind the intense acting style of fellowGerman Klaus Kinski. One of the earliest portrayals of Ivan the Terrible this segment no doubt influenced Sergei Eisenstein when he directed 'Ivan the Terrible Part I and II 1944.' The final story definitely the scariest of the three concerns Jack the Ripper  also referred to as the mythical SpringHeeled Jack for some reason perhaps due to a translation error. Though it barely runs for five minutes I found my heart genuinely thumping as Jack Werner Krauss stalked through the dreamlike haze of Luna Park as the young writer William Dieterle and his girl Olga Belajeff flee from his multiple eerie shadows every step leading them eversocloser to the cold glint of his knife.The framing device around which 'Waxworks' revolves unavoidably leads to a distracting unevenness of tone the atmosphere fluctuating between lighthearted comedy and gruelling horror. Also rather frustrating is the fact that Jannings' segment while certainly entertaining at a satisfactory level is afforded so much screentime and yet Krauss' Jack the Ripper killingspree is wrapped up in a matter of minutes. Since a fourth character tale about Rinaldo Rinaldini was scrapped due to budget constraints I suspect that funding also played a role in reducing the third act. However much of an oddity it might be 'Waxworks' is nevertheless a visual marvel and no shortage of imagination has been expended on the strange and exciting set and costume designs. The film certainly impressed studios in Hollywood for director Paul Leni was subsequently lured to the United States to continue his career after which he notably directed 'The Cat and the Canary 1927' and 'The Man Who Laughs 1928' before his premature death in 1929.".

The last sequence with SpringHeeled Jack comes the closest to producing real fear and it's just unfortunate that it was not more fully developed.The biggest strength of Waxworks is its settings which establish the right atmosphere and lend an aura of the bizarre that helps the stories to be more convincing.

It's a very creative and interesting concept also of course really when considering that this movie got made in 1924.In order to keep all of the stories still somewhat connected and make the movie more coherent as a whole all of the stories feature the two actors William Dieterle and Olga Belajeff each time in different roles. But when you have 2 stories of about halve an hour and then another one of just 5 minutes can you still really call this movie a coherent one? It can be presumed that budgeting reasons was the reason why the last story of the movie is so much shorter. It was originally even planned to shoot a fourth story about Rinaldo Rinaldini. The character can still be seen at the start of movie standing between the other waxed characters. Even though all stories are different and set in completely different time periods they still have the same overall style over it which still is a reason why this movie still feels like a whole one.All the episodes are good looking but the stories for it aren't always that interesting. Basically since it at times it kind of dragging and despite some early action and adventure elements the movie still is sort of a lackluster. Well lacklusting perhaps isn't the right way to describe it. It's more that it's not really engaging enough at all times.But of course the looks and style of the movie compensate a lot. This is a real expressionistic German movie with some fantastic distinctive expressionistic sets. That alone already makes this movie for the lovers of German expressionistic style an absolute mustsee.It's absolutely a great fact that this movie features Emil Jannings Conrad Veidt and Werner Krauss who were really the biggest best known and best German actors of their time. The movie also features William Dieterle who later gained more fame as a director of movies such as The Life of Emile Zola and the 1939 version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame with Charles Laughton.It's basically a fun entertaining movie from the early '20's that is truly worth watching for plenty of reasons.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "As it happens this is yet another faux horror film from director Paul Leni  but then it's mentioned in every book on the genre I have so this common misconception has probably more to do with the authors than with the films themselves having been sold back in the day as such! Anyway this factor had certainly marked my initial viewing of the film  which again I had found rather disappointing a second look reaps rewards in that it can be taken for what it is  and not for what it's been played up to be over the years!

What he doesn't know is that the figure in the Caliph's bed is made of wax he cuts the hand and takes it to his wife who is concealing the real Caliph inside her husband's oven! pursued by the palace guards the wife then pulls a magic trick by 'summoning' the Caliph intact  but asks the latter to reward her husband by making him his personal baker! The sets designed by Leni himself for this episode are spectacular and they're made even more arresting by being filtered through the director's Expressionist sensibilities  so that everything appears distorted and generally exaggerated. This entire Arabian Nights setup apparently inspired Douglas Fairbanks to make THE THIEF OF BAGDAD 1924 and Kino provides a brief clip from that film for the sake of comparison.The second episode  dealing with Czarist Russia at the time of Ivan The Terrible embodied as a neurotic by Conrad Veidt in a performance that anticipates the intense acting style that Klaus Kinski would come to be known for!  is the best despite its extremely slow pace. Interestingly the stylized look of this section of the film also foreshadows Sergei Eisenstein's awesome twopart version made some 20 years later which even adopts the ruse of having Ivan change places with a subordinate in order to dodge an assassination attempt. The romantic leads of the first story who are actually those of the linking narrative  Dieterle being the young writer and Belaieff the daughter of fairground owner John Gottowt return here as a couple whose wedding is disrupted by Veidt who takes a liking to the girl and has her abducted to his lair. The plot is resolved when Ivan's poisonmixer this is how the Czar dispatches his enemies is imprisoned by his own increasingly paranoid ruler but the former takes his revenge by inscribing Ivan's name on a sandglass  the marker that a new victim has been poisoned and has an hour to live  after which the Czar driven insane keeps turning the hourglass upside down in a desperate attempt to buy himself a little more time...! Again apart from Veidt himself the sets are the main thing here the generally grim tone of this episode makes it borderline horror which is only really achieved by the third  and regrettably shortest  segment.The Jack The Ripper story if so it can be called actually ties in with the linking narrative as the writer is stalked in the fairground tent itself by the knifewielding maniac incarnated by the resident villain of the German Expressionist movement Werner Krauss I say incarnated because the character isn't developed in any way given that the episode lasts for barely 5 minutes surely the horror fan's biggest bone of contention with this entertaining superproduction  still the vision of his menacing shadowy figure superimposed magnified and replicated all over the place is extremely effective and one of the undeniable highlights of the entire film.The restored print of WAXWORKS presented here includes several tinted sequences which though nicely done draw too much attention to themselves and worse tend to obscure some of the details in the image!".

The young writer and the showman's daughter  Frau Olga Belejeff  link the three different episodes.The three episodes are stylistically and technically very different from each other and certainly Herr Leni explored his most imaginative resources and fond subjects  oneiric dcors connected with fantastic subjects  using them appropriately to fit the characteristics of the story depicted in the episode in question.The first one which relates the story of the satyr and easygoing Caliph of Bagdad features the beautiful and evocative dcors that apprehend the necessary mood for an episode in which humour and parody over the iconic Western view of an idealized Arab atmosphere. The classic adventures that inspired them is in the air benefiting the episode with such exaggerated tastes which are absolutely charming Herr Jannings certainly enjoys a lot such parody role.The second episode depicts Ivan the terrible as a merciless monarch who ruled the Russian empire with an iron fist by subjecting the citizens to severe cruelty. This time Herr Leni combine drama with fantastic elements achieving a bizarre and disturbing atmosphere. Again a superb actor as it happened in the preceding episode steals the picture thanks to his magnetic and fascinating presence.Once again the dcors are outstanding although this time Herr Leni uses these in a conventional way. That is to say in order to illustrate in a careful and more realistic way the characteristics of the Russian empire of the time the German director leaves the most fantastic aspects of the story for the torture chamber sequences and its terrible ending.The third episode is Expressionism at its best or maybe this Herr Graf should say that is a homage to Expressionism on the other hand the same that happens with the other two episodes in where the main subject are treated in a hyperbolic stylistic way .This time the imaginative writer has a terrible nightmare in which he is chased by Spring Heeled Jack. Herr Leni takes advantage of such an oneiric atmosphere in an episode that technically is more complex than the other two. He uses double exposures and special effects in a continuous nightmarish sequence in which quintessential Expressionism is displayed in an effective and accomplished way.Das Wachsfigurenkabinett is certainly a condensed version of Herr Leni's artistic achievements. It's an excellent example of his many skillful virtues and stylistic resources stamped with his particular and fascinating own imaginary.And now if you'll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must remove in a Teutonic way the depilatory wax from the whole body of one of this Herr Graf's rich heiress.".

I hope people know that Ivan the Terrible did not get obsessed with an hour glass and that Jack the Ripper never killed men. But heck who knows?

	schema:reviewBody "In the 1920s the German film industry was one of the best producers of films in the worldmaking many films that were about as good as anything coming out of Hollywood. Because of this I had relatively high expectations for this film. Sadly however despite this and a wonderful idea for a movie Waxworks turned out to be at best a mediocre filmmostly because it was written so poorly and the stories all were so unsatisfying.The idea behind Waxworks is that the owner of some wax figures wants a writer to come up with some great stories about each of his three figures in order to lure in the public. This anthology notion is pretty good...but the execution left so much to be desired.The first story is about a Caliph in ancient times and this story is by far the longest of the three. It seems that this Caliph has fallen for the baker's wife and he sneaks in to make love to her. At the same time the baker is sneaking in to the nearby palace to steal the Caliph's magic ring. Unable to get it off the hand easily he chops off the Caliph's arm! Oddly the Caliph just lays therebut at the same time he IS at the baker's housewhat gives? This Middle Eastern set is interesting because some of the artistic style looks almost like a book by Dr. Seuss. Unfortunately the story itself isn't particularly interesting even if it starred the worldfamous Emil Jannings. Sadly it's the best of the three.The second story is about Ivan the Terrible. Oddly the sets are VERY tinyalmost claustrophobic. And the story about Ivan poison and madness just isn't interesting in the least.The final about Spring Heeled Jack wasn't great but at least it was visually arresting. That's because like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari it's a wonderful example of German Expressionismwith its crazy art style. It's all supposed to be a dream so it makes sense that that they used this weird look.Overall the film looks pretty cool but the stories just bored me to death. I sure expected better writing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Das Wachsfigurenkabinett or Waxworks is a German silent film from 1924 so over 90 years old by now. Apparently several versions exist as the runtime is sometimes stated slightly over 60 minutes while the version I watched had a little bit more then 80 minutes. In retrospective I have to say I'd have preferred the 60minute version. Birinsky Leni and especially writer Galeen have worked on some pretty famous films from that era but their collaboration here did not result in anything memorable. I thought the production values looked pretty weak here for the most part and this already destroyed every chance at a good horror movie because it is so essential for the genre especially as they could not make up for it via great dialogue for example. The copy I watched was not of great quality but I guess that's not the filmmakers' fault. At least I have seen stuff from decades earlier that was more refined. So despite the inclusion of some pretty big names this one here was a disappointment. I do not recommend watching it.".

So the wax statues of Harun al Raschid Ivan the Terrible and Jack the Ripper do not come to life for real only in the stories which are written and told by William Dieterle to his employee Olga Belajeff. Both of them play various roles in the 3 stories. The best story I thought was the first about the baker in the Far East who thought he had chopped of the arm of the sultan. I thought it was clever and humorous. The second story is about Ivan the Terrible is a lot darker but not so well executed seems rather rushed. Conrad Veidt though is perfectly cast in this role. I have seen him also in Orlacs Hnde and Cabinet of Dr. Caligari really fine actor. The last story is too short and silly to rate. Good idea but I had preferred if they stuck to 1 story and made it more horror.".

The hired writer or Poet William Dieterle then creates fictional stories for three of the wax figures Haroun al Raschid Ivan the Terrible and Jack the Ripper.The writer places himself and the owner's lovely daughter who does little more than smile through the whole film into his fictional scripts. And so what we get is a trio of short stories about these three historical figures with the writer as a central character.The first story about Haroun al Raschid Emil Jannings consumes about half of the film's runtime. The second story runs about thirty minutes. And the third story about Jack the Ripper is mostly just an afterthought.The poet role Dieterle is fine. But the role played by Jannings is horrid he's like something out of a nightmare. His bizarre clothing combined with bizarre facial expressions create a character that is quite repellent. Sans grotesque mustache at times he resembles an inebriated fat old woman. This character is the most memorable image I have of this film and it is not favorable.Visuals are almost as bizarre ... heavy shadows and though technically in BW hues range from brownish to greenish to bluish and even lavender in a few scenes. Shapes of dwellings trend round and resemble stereotyped imperial places in Russia. Acting is horridly melodramatic.Viewers need to give very old films a lot of latitude. But Waxworks doesn't work for me even making allowances for its age. Other films of the silent era are better.".

	schema:headline " A slight disappointment given the promise shown by the final story";
	schema:reviewBody "When a young writer William Dieterle sees an advert in the paper requesting somebody with a big imagination he takes the job and finds himself in a wax museum where the owner asks him to write stories about his three finest works. His models are of Harun alRashid Ivan the Terrible and SpringHeeled Jack and when Harun's arm accidentally drops off the writer's imagination starts to wander and he sets about telling his fantastical tales.Although in essence a horror film Waxworks is more of an anthology film juggling genres and tones to fit the mood of the individual piece. While this can be an inventive and successful approach Creepshow 1982 for example it can also damage a film's flow if not carefully constructed risking leaving one story in another's shadow if they also vary in quality. Waxworks suffers for this unfortunately mainly due to the unevenness in the stories' running times and the sudden shifts in tone. The stories increase in quality as the film goes on which is a good thing but in the case of Waxworks it leaves a disappointing taste in the mouth given the running time of the final piece is within the blink of an eye.The first story has German silent screen legend Emil Jannings playing Harun alRashid who is informed by his adviser that the most beautiful woman he has ever seen played by Olga Belajeff is married to a baker in the city. Rashid goes to win the love of the beauty but she has set her husband Dieterle off to prove himself as a man by stealing the wishing ring from Rashid. Taking a fantasy approach this story also has a sprinkling of comedy. Jannings if a colossal beast as you would expect and brings his dramatic chops to a rarelyseen comedic role. Yet this section drags and the beautiful expressionist sets don't manage to save it from becoming a silly pantomime.Another German silent icon Conrad Veidt plays Ivan the Terrible in the second section which focuses on Ivan's insane obsession with his potion maker who can seemingly strike death upon anyone he chooses. It has all the wideeye operatic tones of Sergei Eisenstein's own Ivan adaptations with Veidt proving the perfect candidate for Ivan's descent into complete madness. And the final story sees the writer fall asleep at his desk and begin a creepy dream about being stalked by a killer Werner Krauss in the streets. It is the final story that remains the most impressive but sadly only lasts about four minutes.Weimar Germany brought some of the greatest screen icons and most innovative directors in cinema history to the fore during the free spirited expressionist movement and although by 1924 the movement was fading away Waxworks has some fine examples. The winding claustrophobic staircases of the city streets in the first story evoke the most popular film of the movement The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari 1920 and in a way Waxworks almost feels like a homage to Robert Wiene's masterpiece employing Krauss who played the titular character and Veidt who both starred. There is certainly a lot to admire here from a visual standpoint but even three silent screen giants can't save it from being a slight disappointment given the promise shown in the final story.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

In fact I noticed that the baker in the first segment is named Assad years before the name became associated with Syria's ruling family.So if you intend to see the movie you would probably just do best to watch only the segments about Rashid and Ivan. Lacking the thoughtprovoking expressionism of Nosferatu and the epic grandeur of Metropolis the movie falls a little flat but isn't terrible by any stretch.

Albert Finney as Daddy Warbucks was wonderful!  He had that stern 'businesslike' attitude which grew into heartfelt love for this little redheaded orphan girl.  Carol Burnett was awesome as the lady who ran the orphanage.  She started out gruff and tumble and drunk but as it turns out she really has a love for these orphans.There is NO comparison to the newest version.  I can't see anyone else playing these parts better than Quinn Burnett and Finney.  It just isn't the same.  If you want a beautiful musical with fun loving attributes please see this movie!!!   Your children will love you for it.Highly Recommended".

As is Aileen Quinn as little orphan Annie. In fact the entire cast are brilliant. Annie is by far one of the best films I have ever seen. One of my favourite parts is the bit where they come in from the movies and Grace and Daddy Warbucks put Annie to bed while she's sleeping.

You definitely have to watch this from the point of view as a child with so many family films out today I know this might be hard when their goal has been to entertain everyone.  I loved all the performances in it from Albert Finney to Carol Burnett and Tim Curry.  My most favorite Huston film is The Misfits but don't expect that from this film which I think alot of people are doing.  As most directors age they tend to get soft in their filmmaking as their hunger is replaced with complacency but this film isn't as bad as some people describe it. It's a musical it was made in the 80's and it's primarily for kids. Compared to other movies made in that time period this one is actually quite good.  And although I've only seen parts of the newer one made by Disney this one seems alot more mature and crafted and not so candycoated.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on a comic strip original written by Harold Gray. Annie Soon became a sensation that turned into a Broadway musical. It was a huge hit so Thomas Meehan had the idea to write a book on the musical and received the tony award for the Best Book of a Musical in 1977. The play ran on Broadway for nearly six years opening in 1977.Annie was set in 1933 during the Great Depression. The Leading cast included Aileen Quinn as Annie Albert Finney as Daddy Oliver Warbucks Ann Reinking as Grace Farrell Warbucks' assistant. Miss Hannigan Played by Carol Burnett and her brother Rooster Hannigan Tim Curry. Bernadette Peters Played by Lily St. Regis and Geoffrey Holder as Punjab. This movie is considered an adventure comedy because of Annie's search for her parents and the encounters that she faces throughout the movie. Annie is an eleven year old orphan during the 1930's. She is very adventurous and tries to escape many times from her orphanage where she lives with the other orphan girls.Their caretaker Miss Hannigan is very mean and treats the girls badly. One day while the girls are cleaning the house Annie hides in the laundry basket and is taken outside to The laundryman who take the sheets and dry cleans them. While Annie is out in the world she see a dog that some boys are picking so she goes and helps. While a Policeman is watching her for a distance she is caught and brought back to the orphanage. Soon after Grace Farrell Warbucks assistance comes to the orphanage to take an orphan to stay with his for a week and she chooses Annie. Annie and Mr. Warbucks get along very well. Until Warbucks wants to adopt her and she shows him the locket and note her parents wrote to her saying that they would come back to get her. Warbucks decides that he will help her find her parents and reward the parents 50000 dollars for coming and taking Annie home. But the people who show up and seem to be her parents turn everything upside down and and things take a crazy twist. spoiler alert The costumes in the movie are good at telling the differences between social classes in the 1930's. The clothes of the poor at the time were dirty old and ripped in some places. When you see Grace Farrell she is dressed very nice as she comes out of the car in front of the orphanage and you are able to see the differences between how rich people dressed and how poor people were dressed.This shows you how hard it was during the great depression. For lower class people who had little or no money. The movie's costume designer does a good job creating images of the hardships that these people went through during the movie. You really feel connected to the movie through the characters clothes. The set design was very well done. It was very elaborate and had many details to show the life of the characters. You were able to tell a lot about the kids from the orphanage where everything was very dirty and old. It wasn't kept in good conditions because they didn't that the time or money. You were able to tell that they did not have enough money and were very poor. Then you have Mr. Warbucks home. It was very big beautiful everything was new and kept very clean and tidy. The clothes were new and expensive and kept very well. you could tell that a lot of work was put into the set design so that the audience could get the full effect of the movie. It helped them feel the character's pain happiness sorrow and anger. My overall opinion of the film was good. I thought the quality of the film was well made. The singing and dancing was well rehearsed and you could tell they put a lot of time into the choreography and practice. The acting was believable when the characters faced a problem in the movie you felt it also.I recommend that people who have not seen the movie should see it because it is a classic movie that will make you laugh and cry.

	schema:headline " It could have been a lot worse it could have been a bit better";
	schema:reviewBody "Under John Huston's direction Annie cannot be accused of manipulating your heartstrings. But when you consider the storyline you feel like it should. Instead it is a bit understated some people are moved by it and others who perhaps don't like musicals in the first place are left cold. My response was in the middle Annie is entertaining but not moving. What's right All of the acting is excellent especially Albert Finney as Daddy Warbucks who accomplishes the difficult feat of recreating an ancient cartoon character. If judged by its retaining the character of the old Little Orphan Annie newspaper cartoon strip the movie succeeds. It is generally difficult to bring a modern Broadway musical to the screen but Vincent Canby in his New York Times review says he didn't much like the stage version and the movie is better. The producer Ray Stark didn't like the Broadway version either. I think Aileen Quinn gets it right not too polished to seem implausible but delivers the lovable perkiness the role calls for. Carol Burnett rises above her television persona to do some real acting  sort of. None of these roles calls for naturalistic acting although Ann Reinking's performance comes the closest. These are roles that have their roots in a cartoon strip not a great novel. As presented this works fine in a musical in part because Huston doesn't overdo it With a less subtle director this could have been a very expensive flop. And there are some genuinely funny scenesparticularly from Burnette and the radio show. The limiting factors are the story and the music which are good but not great a point made by Roger Ebert with whom I often disagree but this time his review gets it right Despite these limitations the movie is still pleasantly entertaining.The movie Annie inevitably gets compared to is Oliver! In some ways Annie works better as a musical precisely because it is so rooted in pure fantasy. You can't help feeling something is lost in Oliver! by moving the gritty realism of the original Charles Dickens into a cotton candy fantasy musical. If Annie is cotton candy well what else was the cartoon strip? But in both Oliver! and Annie the depth of emotion the stories suggest is missing. The message of Annie is surprisingly contemporary to America 30 years later of Annie opening the heart of Daddy Warbucks of FDR drafting him to organize his New Deal jobs programs. Spoiler alertAs to the ending I really wish the Carol Burnett character had been fired or led off in handcuffs. But I guess Annie herself was not mean spirited so forgiveness was more appropriate. We could learn a lot from Annie which I suppose is the whole point of the story. I recommend watching Annie not only because it is enjoyable but also for cultural literacy because there are so many references to it in other movies. And don't miss the legendary Ray Bolger as the radio sound effects man tap dancing with his hands!".

	onyx:emotionText "Under John Huston's direction Annie cannot be accused of manipulating your heartstrings. But when you consider the storyline you feel like it should. Instead it is a bit understated some people are moved by it and others who perhaps don't like musicals in the first place are left cold. My response was in the middle Annie is entertaining but not moving. What's right All of the acting is excellent especially Albert Finney as Daddy Warbucks who accomplishes the difficult feat of recreating an ancient cartoon character. If judged by its retaining the character of the old Little Orphan Annie newspaper cartoon strip the movie succeeds. It is generally difficult to bring a modern Broadway musical to the screen but Vincent Canby in his New York Times review says he didn't much like the stage version and the movie is better. The producer Ray Stark didn't like the Broadway version either. I think Aileen Quinn gets it right not too polished to seem implausible but delivers the lovable perkiness the role calls for. Carol Burnett rises above her television persona to do some real acting  sort of. None of these roles calls for naturalistic acting although Ann Reinking's performance comes the closest. These are roles that have their roots in a cartoon strip not a great novel.

I don't mind them but musicals are never my first choice. Although I am a big Oliver fan.Annie was a nice film about a little orphan who is in a horrible orphanage and tried to get away to find her real parents. One day a lady comes to the orphanage and takes Annie for 1 week to live in a huge mansion with a billionaire... he is only allowing this for his image as it makes everyone think he cares.Now as you can expect from any musical except Sweeney Todd the acting was not that good. Especially by Annie. But the bad acting didn't ruin the movie. The songs were very catchy and there were obviously a couple of very famous songs too.The cast was quite impressive...Albert Finney was quite funny in the movie playing the billionaire Oliver Warbucks. I also thought that Carol Burnett was very funny as the evil woman running the orphanage. The best role though has to go to Tim Curry. He plays a great character and as always does a fantastic job. The surprise appearance was from Geoffrey Holder... I mainly know him from Live and Let Die One of my favourite Bond films where he plays Baron Samedi... in Annie he plays Punjab. Not his best role but still quite good.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Even though the acting was not up to scratch i can still see why this film is locked into a lot of peoples hearts. Very entertaining.For more of my reviews please like my Facebook pagehttpswww.facebook.compagesOrdinaryPersonMovie Reviews456572047728204?refhl".

She is a legitimate Shirley Temple clone.Albert Finney also is enjoyable as Daddy Warbucks although he does get a bit too loud at times. The little girls in the orphanage are talented good singers and dancers. Their songanddance numbers are more entertaining than the adult's. Some of the latter's could have been left out although there is a great Busby Berkeleytype number when the adults and kids all go to the movies. The period  around 1932  is pretty to view with nice sets. This is a big budget film and it shows....and the ending is nice.THE BAD  Carol Burnett is really annoying to watch not because she plays the villain but because of her abrasive voice and her pronounced Gd exclamations. Speaking of the latter Tim Curry yells out a GD which has no place in a family film like this. Interesting also to note that unlike the Temple movies the only religion given credence here is Buddhism as Geoffrey Holder plays a Buddhist with supernatural powers. Give me a break! This is so typical of today's films. And another with that theme of course Democrat Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor are portrayed as extremely caring wonderful people while Finney is the gruff Republican.OVERALL  Quinn and Finney are so good that they far outweigh Burnett's negative traits and make this a good film to own.".

All of my girls love Annie but this version only they don't care for the remakes. Annie is a classic movie that I am honored to share with my girls today! I have never loved a movie as much as this one. I went through 4 VHS tapes and now own the DVD of Annie. It has stood the test of time. I will not be surprised to see it last another 20 years. I do agree with the omission of Tomorrow it should have been a main part of the show. Albert Finney was great as Daddy Warbucks. I wonder what Grace Farrell is doing now. I tried looking for info on the kids especially Molly I thought she was adorable it seems like the kids aren't acting anymore. Aileen Quinn was the best choice for Annie in my opinion.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though this film of the musical Annie has often been criticized for a number of  reasons it is hardly the worst screen adaptation of a stage musical the utterly  grotesque 1974 film of Mame takes that dishonor. This film is not nearly as bad  as people have said. Though not necessarily a great film it is a good film with a  number of strengths. The film's strongest asset is definitely its cast the highlight of which being Carol  Burnett a treat to watch as Miss Hannigan. Newcomer Aileen Quinn plays a charming Annie Albert Finney makes a wholly convincing Daddy Warbucks and Ann  Reinking gives a winning performance as his assistant Grace Farrell. At the film's core is a heartwarming if somewhat sentimental story set in the  Depression backed by most of Charles Strouse and Martin Charnin's unforgettable  score. Six of the play's songs are dropped and five new ones have been written.  The best of them is the humorous Sign' between Burnett and Finney. The largescale Busby Berkeleyesque Let's Go to the Movies' though it's a nice  song and a spectacular number it threatens to slow down the picture and is thus  a bit of a weak spot. It is a forgivable one though. A song called Dumb Dog' whose melody is taken from the onenight wonder A Broadway Musical replaces Tomorrow' in its proper place in the story which is a  loss. The reprise of the song Sandy' works better. The fifth new song a swinger called We Got Annie' is a highly listenable reworking of a song cut from the stage play. Director John Huston a choice that confounded many in Hollywood directs the film  with competence though it's not a personal film for him. Most of the credit for  putting the production together goes to producer Ray Stark. He assembles a production crew that works together to create a visually splendid film with beautiful period sets. The film's production is indeed extravagant even by Hollywood standards but only once or twice does it go over the top as in the end  of the picture. The film as a whole is an engagingly oldfashioned musical spectacle with enough  wit charm and genuine warmth to offset its core sentimentality and occasional  excess. Though it doesn't follow the stage version to the letter it still works  pretty well. Score 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Crash Davis loves baseball more than it loves him. He believes in the game. He deserves to be in the show but he isn't and never will be. But still he plays on dutifully and to a certain extent joyfully. Better to play crappy Aball than sell shoes.That for me is the central theme of this film. It is all summed up when Crash tells Nuke the wild young star pitcher You don't respect yourself. That's your problem. You don't respect the game. That's my problem.Take a player that passionate and a youngster that annoying add in a sexy yet maternal fan and you have great comedy. Bull Durham works scene after scene because the film never forgets that baseball is what binds all the characters together.Tim Robbins is nothing short of brilliant and Nuke Laloosh the rising star youngster who walks 18 batters and strikes out 18 batters in his first minor league appearance  both league records. But Nuke is caught up in his fat contract his Porsche and his endless parade of women. Baseball is a sideline. Eventually Crash's mentoring begins to pay off until he finally realizes that winning is like you know better than losing!The love triangle between Annie Susan Sarandon Crash and Nuke is wonderful and funny but it mainly provides us with set up for the baseball scenes like when Sarandon convinces Nuke to wear women's underwear while he pitches. Or my favourite scene when Annie and Crash take batting practise together Annie dressed like she is ready for a wedding but determined to correct Crash's swing. Crash is determined to take Annie home. They flirt and practice batting in one of the best prolonged foreplay scenes ever filmed.The ending is satisfying but the real depth of this film is harmony that the game brings to the characters.  out of .".

	onyx:emotionText "Crash Davis loves baseball more than it loves him. He believes in the game. He deserves to be in the show but he isn't and never will be. But still he plays on dutifully and to a certain extent joyfully. Better to play crappy Aball than sell shoes.That for me is the central theme of this film. It is all summed up when Crash tells Nuke the wild young star pitcher You don't respect yourself. That's your problem. You don't respect the game. That's my problem.Take a player that passionate and a youngster that annoying add in a sexy yet maternal fan and you have great comedy. Bull Durham works scene after scene because the film never forgets that baseball is what binds all the characters together.Tim Robbins is nothing short of brilliant and Nuke Laloosh the rising star youngster who walks 18 batters and strikes out 18 batters in his first minor league appearance  both league records. But Nuke is caught up in his fat contract his Porsche and his endless parade of women. Baseball is a sideline. Eventually Crash's mentoring begins to pay off until he finally realizes that winning is like you know better than losing!The love triangle between Annie Susan Sarandon Crash and Nuke is wonderful and funny but it mainly provides us with set up for the baseball scenes like when Sarandon convinces Nuke to wear women's underwear while he pitches. Or my favourite scene when Annie and Crash take batting practise together Annie dressed like she is ready for a wedding but determined to correct Crash's swing. Crash is determined to take Annie home. They flirt and practice batting in one of the best prolonged foreplay scenes ever filmed.The ending is satisfying but the real depth of this film is harmony that the game brings to the characters.  out of .";

	schema:reviewBody "Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon.I thought I read the book or at least I dreamed it but this is NOT adapted from something by Larry McMurtry although it sure seems like it oughta be. It is one hell of a funny crafty too real for life kind of movie. The brilliant script full of clever oneliners was written by Ron Shelton White Men Can't Jump 1992 who actually played minor league ball in the Orioles farm system. Shelton also directed and did a bangup job. This is a funny movie that is really funny.What I recalled when I found out this wasn't from Larry McMurtry was a baseball novel for juniors that I had read when I was a kid about a crafty veteran minor league catcher who had once made it to the big leagues but got beaned and never got over it always bailing out from an inside curve ball. This was in the days before batting helmets. He fell back to the minors and went from team to team and town to town hitting a ton until somebody figured out that his knees would buckle if you brushed him back a bit and then he'd have to move on. Kevin Costner's part reminds me of that guy without the beaning phobia. Susan Sarandon plays Annie Savoy a baseball groupie in her sexual prime who likes to read poetry and give the players hitting advice. She is just wonderful as she plays sexy mom to the boys a new one every summer just so she can avoid any kind of real relationship or commitment. And so along comes Crash Davis Kevin Costner one of the more underrated and less flashy stars of our time playing an itinerant catcher who has managed to hit nearly 300 minor league home runs. He is tough and savvy and once made it to the Show for 21 days. Tim Robbins plays Ebby Calvin Nuke Meat LaLoosh a not too bright wildarmed phenom who needs more than a little guidance. He gets a lot from both Crash and Annie who are intent on schooling him in their differing expertise. Nuke is just the hunk Annie needs to keep her from falling in love with Crash but...well this is a romantic comedy so you can be sure that love will find a way.The baseball shtick and the interior dialogues of Robbins and Costner during the games Why's he want the heat? I wanna throw the deuce... And Don't think ... Get that...woman out of your headTime out! are really funny and the bit where Robbins shakes him off and Costner as an object lesson for his young pitcher tells the batter what's coming next allowing the batter to hit it out of the park or onto the Bull Durham sign to win a free steak dinneris this genuine Americana or what? are a crack up. But also great are the scenes with Sarandon as she philosophizes I believe in the Church of Baseball and wisecracks her way through the boys of summer especially the scene where she ties Nuke up in bed and reads him some Walt Whitman. Now THAT really tires the boy out! Another great scene is on the bus when Crash lets the other players know that he once made it to the bigs where ...you hit white balls for batting practice and the ballparks are like cathedrals. Beautiful.Best deadpan oneliner is when Crash catches Nuke in the locker room trying to adjust the panty hose girdle that Annie has talked him into wearing under his uniform The rose goes in the front big guy.By the way the great rock and roll soundtrack includes the galvanizing baseball song BrownEyed Handsome Man by John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival fame. Or maybe the title's In Center Field Put me in coach. I'm ready to play today in center field.It's a shame that Shelton did not win the Oscar for this script it's really that good. Ronald Bass won for Rain Man. The characters are just fascinating and full of life and not just the three leads. The bit players are funny too including the hardtalking middlebrained manager the mindless pattering coaches the sweet young groupie girl who makes it with all the players as fast as she can. Even the team clown is good.The irreverent characterizations the sweet story the realistic atmosphere of baseball in small town America only slightly burlesqued and some fine acting all rolled together make this one highly diverting little film actually one of the best baseball films ever made. See this with your best babe. She'll like it as much as you.".

There's all the love in the world for this great American pastime but there's also some interesting and literate discussions going on all the time in this smart and witty comedy as well as some memorable characters whom we like and find easy to watch.Kevin Costner plays Crash Davis a veteran minor league catcher who's hired by the Durham Bulls to act as a mentor to their new pitcher Ebby LaLoosh Tim Robbins. Ebby is in need of some direction as he may be truly talented but has ego and discipline problems. At the same time sexy Annie Savoy Susan Sarandon the Bulls' loyal groupie takes an interest in Ebby as she makes a habit of hooking up with one young player every season and helping the man to mature. Naturally some sparks fly as the two guys both get attracted to Annie.Writer  director Ron Shelton truly knows the territory having been a minor league baseball player himself although he doesn't in truth feature a lot of game action. His dialogue is often very funny and often very profane. A lot of humour comes from Annies' manipulation of the naive Ebby whom she nicknames Nuke and has him do things like wear a garter thinking this will improve his game. And while the film does get serious at times it never becomes too maudlin. As was said previously the attraction comes from watching three intriguing characters and three fine performances. With fine support by Trey Wilson and Robert Wuhl Costner Sarandon and Robbins make the most of the material. There's also some endearing goofiness from the reallife Clown Prince of Baseball a man named Max Patkin. And to top it all off there are some very sexy scenes in this thing especially towards the end. All in all this likable story has a little something for everybody and is well worth a viewing.Eight out of 10.".

The struggle between men and women teacher and student and different personalities in a work environment. The parallels between all of life and this movie are great. The baseball is even better.

Raw talent sometimes is more plentiful than brains. Tim Robbins is a young pitcher Nuke LaLoosh needing a lot of instruction if he is to make it to the bigs. Aging catcher Crash Davis played by Kevin Costner is assigned to the team to whip the youngster into shape. The team's number one groupie played by Susan Sarandon wraps both players around her little finger.Hilarious situations and the lighter side of baseball. This movie made me a Sarandon fan. Robert Wuhl and Trey Wilson provide backup.".

However there are exceptions to most things and that's the case here and Major League because it's not really a baseball story.....just a tale about lowlife people. It's no surprise that Susan Sarandon Tim Robbins and Kevin Costner play the leading roles in this sleazy film. It goes right along with their reallife backgrounds especially Sarandon and Robbins. Soo....instead of an oldfashioned nice sports story or a clean comedy about baseball all you get is sleazy dialogue about a female owner of a team whose sole aim is to jump in bed with this promising rookie. And promising doesn't mean his baseball talent. The sport takes a back seat to sex in this movie plain and simple. The dialog is very profane filled with blasphemy and all of that seems to be the real focus of this film nothing else. It's almost like an in joke among these elitist Hollywood people who made this. I am sorry that Costner who does have some reverence for the game and knows how to play it lowered himself to play this role. Making fun of baseball or its owners or players is fine  but this is just belowthebelt humor and not really very funny. This movie is praised way more than it's deserved to be.".

Annie Savoy does the best monologue ever known to my ears her comparsions of baseball to a religion speak deeply into my heart because I have been a fan since I can remember and I will be until the day I die. The Annie character is also an interesting twist on the necessity of a female figure to calm down too much boiling testosterone.MLB players like Milton Bradley need an Annie Savoy  unfortunetely they apparently do not yet I hope these tortured souls of MLB will someday find an Annie or at least watch this movie so chairs stop flying into the stands at MLB parks and these guys can get back to the real business of just playing the game.If you are a serious baseball fan this is a must see if you're clueless or just don't get the draw of not just the game but of honest Americana  don't bother maybe at least try to figure it out.".

Except Costner refuses to compete  and now his assignment of getting star pitcher Robbins to buckle down and concentrate on Baseball is made much harder...It starts well with Sarandon's voiceover making these big promises to liken baseball to sex and religion with a church choir playing in the background as the camera looks at various shrines in her room. I was so excited seeing this that when the movie turned out to be just another love triangle losingteamtriumphs sports movie I was very disappointed.There is still sex and superstition in it but the film doesn't really fulfill its promise to demonstrate to me how baseball could be a religion to anybody except the players. Here's why1 The only two nonplayer characters we meet are a slut who sleeps with all and any of the players and Susan Sarandon who only sleeps with one player a season and is always in the power position so she's more like a sexual predator. In introducing actual sex the screenwriters have made it impossible for us to see how baseball could compare. We get the sense that sleeping with the men and watching them play baseball are two completely different interests for these women.2 The story is too smallscale to fulfill Sarandon's promises. We never get these global grande feeling that baseball means more than just hitting balls and boredom. We only experience these few characters.3 The other reason its not very effective is the screenplay is not wellfocused. It meanders all over the place  giving us nondescript scenes of baseball travelling on the road.4 Costner's storyline is almost forgotten. Its just badly written. He never goes out of his way to pull Robbins in line because the love triangle interferes.5 They pretty much assume that just showing us some Baseball will make us moan with ecstacy  but you pretty much need to already bring a love of Baseball to this flick to do that.25".

	schema:reviewBody "In Durham North Carolina the minor league baseball team the Durham Bulls are having a horrible season. However things may be looking up for the team as they have signed a promising rookie pitcher Ebby Calvin LaLoosh Tim Robbins.The team hires a catcher by the name of Crash Davis Kevin Costner who is nearing the end of his professional baseball career in the minors in a career that included three weeks in the major leagues or the show as it is known in the minors to teach the rookie. LaLoosh also gets some coaching by wellknown groupie Annie Savoy Susan Sarandon who hooks up with a player for the season which many consider a good thing due to her unusual coaching ways in the sport she legitimately loves.Although Annie has picked LaLoosh whom she gives the nickname Nuke to it is getting quite obvious that she is falling for Crash who is pretty much her intellectual equal.Now the two have to battle over the same player as they try not to act on their attraction for one another.This is suppose to be a comedy right? Well where were the laughs? I didn't laugh at all at any of the jokes. I probably only slightly chuckled at a couple of jokes through the entire movie. The jokes fell completely flat in this movie.Another thing I noticed in this movie is that it lagged the entire length of the film. The movie is very slow and pretty boring. Part of the bordom is thanks to the supporting cast.The supporting cast is completely boring. Not one advance the story nor do they add to the movie. In fact the supporting cast subplots do not go anywhere at all. They aren't even developed as much as the three main characters Nuke Annie and Crash.In fact the main characters chemistry wasn't that great. Although the performers were good in their roles there was very little spark between them. I also thought that they had their moments together.If I'm not mistaken this is the movie where Sarandon and Robbins became an item. I felt that their onscreen chemistry was a bit weak especially when she started going after Crash. And I felt no romantic spark between Annie and Crash. I also found the music was pretty boring. Most of the songs were a little old to the point that the youngest members of the adult audience would not know them. I found that the music didn't really enhance the scenes at all.I was also unimpressed with the sets used in the movie. Annie's home was filled with junk and had way too much of it. I was also disappointed in the baseball scenes.The scenes on the diamond were just OK. Some had Crash teach Nuke some lessons while some were just game play. I was not impressed with the game play scenes. None of the plays were too exciting and just didn't do anything to the movie except remind you that this is a movie surrounding a minor league baseball season.This movie is not for children especially young ones. There is a lot of sexuallyoriented language and some sexual situations. There is some sexual innuendo as well.I've read that this movie is one of the greatest sports movies of all time. However it appeared that baseball was not that major in the story itself.Even the wardrobes were pretty boring. I really could not tell when this movie was suppose to take place. Annie's outfits looked to be about 30 years older than the rest of the cast's outfits.In my opinion this is certainly not the classic sports movie that people say it is. I found it boring and suggest that you see it on regular TV where it is edited for content and time aloud. You won't miss too much.".

	schema:reviewBody "What is Bull Durham about? On the surface it's about baseball the love joy pain and madness of baseball. But it's really about life. The baseball team are the Durham Bulls a variation on the title a minor league North Carolina team who aren't very good.The 3 central characters of the film are Crash Davis Annie Savoy and Ebbie Calvin 'Nuke' LaLoosh played respectively by Kevin Costner Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins in a triumvirate of truly focused convincing memorable performances. All 3 actors imbibe their characters with humanity and unique qualities. They all pair off at different times in the film and have a variety of memorable interactions and discussions. ANNIE AND NUKE Annie chooses every season to 'pair up' with one of the players and it comes down to Crash the catcher and Nuke the pitcher. Annie 'chooses' Nuke but mainly because Crash 'rejects' her. Annie and Nuke share a set of hilarious scenes together. Annie much older than Nuke uses him to satisfy her sexual desires and need to stay and feel young and vibrant. Also she is helping him with his pitching. But there is also a maternal instinct that kicks in. It's obvious that Sarandon Annie and Robbins Nuke offscreen relationship contributed to their onscreen chemistry.NUKE AND CRASH Crash is literally traded to the Bulls engineered by the team manager so that he can mentor Nuke's pitching thus preparing him for the major leagues. Crash is a veteran with a lot of experience and advice that Nuke can use but Nuke doesn't always listen so Crash has to constantly teach him lessons and reminds him who's boss. Crash and Nuke have a big brotherlittle brother relationship with Crash doling out advice but also there is 'sibling' rivalry because of Annie. Crash sees the greatness in Nuke's pitching and is living his dream through Nuke. If Nuke makes it to the majors he'll know that he made it too. Their last scene together is the most touching moment in the film. Costner and Robbins convey a real funny male bonding relationship that is a special part of the film.CRASH AND ANNIE And now to the creme de la creme! The piesta de resistance! The pairing to end all pairings! Crash and Annie! It's always hard to see what is really going on when you first see a film but when I saw this film 20 years ago I really kind of knew how it was going to end with Crash and Annie but didn't really appreciate at the time how it got there. After watching the film again over the years I really see the true magic of the CrashAnnie relationship. It's got to be the most fun I've ever had waiting for 2 characters to get together in a film. It's obvious from the beginning even when she's playing her baseball groupie games that Annie wants Crash from the start. You can see it in the way she looks at him when she first sees him. It's love at first sight. Of course we find out how she feels later in the film but it's obvious she wanted him from the start. You can feel the sexual tension and desire in all of Crash and Annie's scenes together even when they are playing word games and seemingly don't want each other. When they finally do get together it is one of the rawest hottest sexiest series of scenes ever put to the screen so be warned! Costner and Sarandon as Crash and Annie can lay claim to having provided the viewer with the sexiest scenes recorded in film history. The look that they give each other when both finally realize that they have each other is almost as hot as the series of scenes succeeding this. The way that Crash looks at Annie is the way a woman wants a man to look at her when he wants her and the way Annie looks at Crash is the way a man wants a woman to look at him when she wants him even though the average guy supposedly doesn't really care. But for Annie Crash isn't the average guy not just some seasonal fling who she can forget about later. Crash for her is THE ONE a man who shares all her interests reading philosophy old music and of course baseball. And for Crash Annie is the person he's been waiting for all his life who saves him at just the right time when he's approaching middle age and realizing that he's at a crossroads in his life. She gives him something to live for and continue on. Their final scenes together are truly special. The irony is that if they had gotten together from the beginning I don't think they would have ended up together because they needed to learn about and really size up each other to make sure that they were meant to be.Of course the brilliance of the film is not only these 3 characters but also the way that it chooses not to glamorize or glorify baseball but rather let baseball play second fiddle to the real story of the film life itself. There's a lot of great dialogue and funny scenes with other characters as well. The scene with all the baseball players and coach on the mound talking about 'wedding gifts' is classic! Wonder if this happens in the majors! But a lot of the baseball moments still feel and seem realistic Crash mentally 'talking' to himself while trying to get a hit off a pesky pitcher Nuke literally talking to himself while trying not to think so much while pitching Crash using his veteran savvy as a catcher to throw off batters to get them to strike out. So what is Bull Durham? Well in order it's...1...a love story 2...about relationships 3...about midlife crises 4...about life itself 5...about baseball".

I believe Ron Shelton wrote a screenplay based upon his experiences in the minor leagues and feel the balance between baseball as a fun game and as a businessjob were overall solid.Here's my main problem with the film  the character of Annie is ultimately a selfrighteous manipulative whore. While Susan Sarandon is a talented actress I don't feel her character portrayed passionate fans of baseball in a positive light. I did appreciate that by the end of the film she was going to retire from her life of bedroom spring training but her character lacked one of two things either she was too stupid to be the literary scholar she proposed herself to be or she was too smart to be the baseball tramp she reveled in. I find it hard to believe that her screw a ballplayer mentality was anything less than selfrighteous notches in the bedpost so she could pat herself on the back later. She used the ballplayers for sport and fun as Kevin Costner's character noted as men she could control and bully. A comparable male character would be vilified for years as a sexual predator and masochistic abuser yet we are supposed to laugh when it's done as a woman? Kevin Costner gave a solid performance as the wise end of career catcher but the friendships he appeared to have gained in the sport over the years were rarely displayed.The character Tim Robbins portrayed was basically a dumb albeit talented jock. He wasn't smart enough to know he was being used and was essentially a cardboard cutout of a novice player with talent but no brains. Considering the rest of the players got very little screen time it's hard to comment on them except for the religious ballplayer who married Susan Sarandon's slutintraining. I can accept it as an unlikely scenario in a comedy but it's the only malefemale relationship I could allow to slide by since the woman wasn't developed as a character very fully.Overall I found the game of baseball handled in a good and serious manner befitting the thousands of players currently working in the minor leagues but the portrayal of Annie as a savior and helper of one player per season was despicable via her manipulative use of sex and need for control. Having said that I'm glad that in Ron Shelton's future films particularly Tin Cup he was able to address the complications of the professional athlete's psyche via the use of professional help Rene Russo's character. Bull Durham ultimately was an exercise in how a selfrighteous controlling nymphomaniac baseball fan gets her jollies. How is that entertaining as the cornerstone of a film? Based upon her character I am unable to recommend this film.".

At times the protagonists' embarrassment before the camera is palpable. Many scenes involving the couple seem posed and the main incident involving Norman's sled breaking through the ice the reenactment of what may or may not be a true episode is not convincing. Voiceover representing the inner voice is omnipresent. One is left to wonder whether excellent actors would not have played Norman and May Loo more convincingly than they themselves. The documentary character of the movie might have remained partly intact the director having resorted to constructs several times. Even so the narrative arc remains fairly shallow.This is a movie without apparent violence. Yet violence is subliminally present it is after all the violence of the logging companies against nature's treasures which trigger the film's central action Norman's move to less disequilibrated territory. One strongly senses the violence of advancing alldevouring modern society. This film could not be more different from the 'classic' trapper movies like Jeremiah Johnson' .For having succeeded with this nonviolent portrait of violence and for having dared the climate and returned with such magnificent photography Le Dernier Trappeur deserves 810.".

The movie portrays the harshness of life in the wild and documents a lifestyle that is soon to be extinguished by the ever expanding modernization.

	schema:headline " Where are the First Nations?";
	schema:reviewBody "I agree this film is worth viewing for the gorgeous images of nature. However there are several aspects that make me wonder.How can it happen that the trapper never meets any First Nations people in particular Northern Athabaskan people apart from his wife? If that is merely due to low population density how can it happen that he never thinks or speaks about them in particular considering how much he's worried about the role of man as part of nature as a respectful partner of nature and the danger that man might stop playing that role? There are many First Nations in North America striving hard to live a lifestyle respectful of nature and they are far from giving up on it even though their Nations have been under dire pressure from Europeanstyle civilization for generations. As opposed to our two trappers in the film there are many young people among them actually First Nations populations in North America tend to be growing today.I can't understand why the filmmakers chose to keep that topic dead quiet in particular considering that more than one First Nation is mentioned during the end credits of the film so it does appear they used indigenous knowledge and help in making the film. It seems disrespectful to me and filled with bitter irony to make a film claiming that nature needs man for its equilibrium and then represent man as a white trapper not once mentioning First Nations... Certainly not all white people are evil and First Nations are not simply noble savages but the general tendency is that white hunters have not been all that helpful to the equilibrium of nature in North America and First Nations have greatly suffered from it. A white trapper using First Nations for nothing except getting a much younger wife to serve him is even worse than the average racist clich...Besides i have to support the observation by hsilberstein1 that the behavior of the trapper makes you wonder. I admit i lived in cities all my life so i may not be very qualified to judge backcountry survival skills but i have done a lot of alpine mountaineering in my life and i have done a number of multiday hikes in the outback in Canada in bear country some of them solo. In addition to the dubious scenes listed by hsilberstein1 there are several more where he behaves in ways that even i with my limited experience can easily recognize as needlessly asking for trouble. Among the worst is his encounter with the adult brown bear. He surprises a huge Grizzly at close range and the animal is obviously deeply scared by the man It gets up on its hind legs and bares his fangs which a Grizzly usually only does when feeling threatened. What does the trapper do? He utters no word. In such a situation it is imperative to start speaking no matter what in a low monotonous voice like when consoling a child. He does not move at all. In such a situation it is imperative to slowly back away without turning around and without stumbling. He does not slowly raise his arms to appear larger. He does not pick up his dog thus risking that it might run away or that it might even make a rush at the bear or that the bear might choose to try and catch it. Instead he challenges the already upset bear by staring at him for a considerable time right into his eyes. He is indeed lucky to get away with that absurd almost suicidal behavior. Kudos to that bear for keeping his cold blood anyway and doing the reasonable thing just leaving the scene all the same. Given numerous instances of such strange behavior i doubt this film has much merit as a documentary.".

If that is merely due to low population density how can it happen that he never thinks or speaks about them in particular considering how much he's worried about the role of man as part of nature as a respectful partner of nature and the danger that man might stop playing that role? There are many First Nations in North America striving hard to live a lifestyle respectful of nature and they are far from giving up on it even though their Nations have been under dire pressure from Europeanstyle civilization for generations. As opposed to our two trappers in the film there are many young people among them actually First Nations populations in North America tend to be growing today.I can't understand why the filmmakers chose to keep that topic dead quiet in particular considering that more than one First Nation is mentioned during the end credits of the film so it does appear they used indigenous knowledge and help in making the film. It seems disrespectful to me and filled with bitter irony to make a film claiming that nature needs man for its equilibrium and then represent man as a white trapper not once mentioning First Nations... Certainly not all white people are evil and First Nations are not simply noble savages but the general tendency is that white hunters have not been all that helpful to the equilibrium of nature in North America and First Nations have greatly suffered from it. A white trapper using First Nations for nothing except getting a much younger wife to serve him is even worse than the average racist clich...Besides i have to support the observation by hsilberstein1 that the behavior of the trapper makes you wonder. I admit i lived in cities all my life so i may not be very qualified to judge backcountry survival skills but i have done a lot of alpine mountaineering in my life and i have done a number of multiday hikes in the outback in Canada in bear country some of them solo. In addition to the dubious scenes listed by hsilberstein1 there are several more where he behaves in ways that even i with my limited experience can easily recognize as needlessly asking for trouble. Among the worst is his encounter with the adult brown bear. He surprises a huge Grizzly at close range and the animal is obviously deeply scared by the man It gets up on its hind legs and bares his fangs which a Grizzly usually only does when feeling threatened. What does the trapper do? He utters no word. In such a situation it is imperative to start speaking no matter what in a low monotonous voice like when consoling a child. He does not move at all. In such a situation it is imperative to slowly back away without turning around and without stumbling. He does not slowly raise his arms to appear larger. He does not pick up his dog thus risking that it might run away or that it might even make a rush at the bear or that the bear might choose to try and catch it. Instead he challenges the already upset bear by staring at him for a considerable time right into his eyes. He is indeed lucky to get away with that absurd almost suicidal behavior. Kudos to that bear for keeping his cold blood anyway and doing the reasonable thing just leaving the scene all the same. Given numerous instances of such strange behavior i doubt this film has much merit as a documentary.";

I wondered how many sled dogs were actually injured in the making of this film.I really liked the trapper's native wife and wish she had a bigger role in the film. She was a very interesting character but she basically just step and fetched for the trapper all day long. The trapper had a gorgeous canoe and great dogs too.The film is basically about a bunch of old guys who don't want to leave the wilderness. However judging by all the trouble they get into I think it is high time they move to a retirement community with safe activities overlooking the mountains!".

	schema:reviewBody "Of all the films that make me laugh out loud Katzelmacher is probably the blackest. How else to justify the enjoyable quality of a movie in which almost all the characters if not human scum act that way most of the time. Make no mistake the young Fassbinder knew exactly what he was doing when he made this early brilliant piece. Every shot has been planned with a single mindedness that enhances the meaningfulness of his exploration of xenophobia and its causes in dissatisfaction with financial circumstances and unfulfilled human relationships. Some eight or so young people of mixed sex pass their time in mainly useless activities. When they are not having it off with one another generally in a lacklustre way or playing cards in the local caf they spend the time lounging about in the street outside an apartment building their apartness from each other expressed in the horizontal line they form as they lean against a railing generally staring towards the camera. The building behind is not a slum. It could be a middle class dwelling in any town. The white wall behind is punctuated by windows with flower boxes. This and other settings are never sordid merely dull. Inside buildings by seldom moving the camera reflects the inertia of these aimless people. For the first third of the film nothing much happens. Then there is the sudden entry of a young Greek worker played by Fassbinder himself to ignite the latent xenophobic prejudices of the rest of the cast. They wind each other up by exaggerating all those qualities they feel the Greek might have including being a rapist and worst of all a communist. The men need little to start them off once they learn from one who shares a lodging with the Greek that he has a bigger dick than the rest of them. For the women it is the unfounded rape allegation that sparks indignation and a call for vigilante violence. At the same time as being enormously funny this part of the film in its depiction of xenophobia as the product of ignorance is hammered home with ferocious integrity. Perhaps the most original touch is the punctuation of the action at various points with brief sequences in which different pairs of characters stroll very slowly between the same two rows of garages to the accompaniment of a badly overpedalled performance of a piano Schubert waltz. Their laconic comments have the function of a kind of Greek chorus binding the film together in a curiously subtle way. If you are looking for an early Fassbinder gem Katzelmacher is the one I would recommend.".

They treat each other like garbage though they are too lazy to do any real damage. However when a Greek immigrant rents an apartment from one of them their cruelty becomes more and more tangible.

The men call him a communist behind his back and then right to his face as he speaks almost no German. When the Greek actually begins dating one of them played by Fassbinder's most beloved actress Hanna Schygulla their threats no longer remain merely threats. It's a great story really and if done in Fassbinder's more honed melodrama style one of the most unique directorial voices we'll ever hear it could have been a great film. But in this early stage this was his second feature film Fassbinder was more of an avantguard artist striving towards Brecht I suppose and maybe looking towards the French New Wave. The results are mixed but mostly leaning towards the annoying side. The film plays like a 90 minute Calvin Klein ad with the camera lingering too long on motionless disinterested performers. One of the better scenes has one of the actresses singing an American song in a delightfully amateurish manner while dancing. Somehow this is very beautiful. There is a repeated scene where two characters will walk forward on the same street arm in arm with soft piano music in the background the only extradiagetic music in the film. This gimmick didn't work very well. While there are some beautiful bits of the film  besides the aforementioned dance the relationship between Fassbinder and Schygulla is rather gentle and melancholy  it pretty much fails.

	schema:reviewBody "I think in big parts the film is about dynamics. Different couples with different dynamics. One couple in which the man treats his woman harshly one in which he treats her more tenderly until he is eager for more money and one in which the woman has the upper hand in the household apparently because she brings home the money. Yet they all seem to be in love with their partner and they are all friends with each other.Money also plays an important role overall. Those who have money are more oppressive and dominating. As if having money gives one more of a right to tell your partner what he or she should do in things that have nothing to do with money. Two of the men consider doing something illegal that should bring big bucks. This was the cause for some quarrels with their women who found the idea appealing but didn't want to risk it. We never learn what it was they had planned and eventually they dropped the idea. But the relationships with their women were hurt permanently by this dispute.Everyone seemed to have sex with everyone except the ugly woman without being much of an issue but hey it was 1969. In fact it only was an issue when one of the women demanded money for it. It made her a whore but the other women doing it for free didn't make them whores. Except for maybe the woman who was said to have sex with the guestworker from Greece.The scenes of always two different characters walking with the melancholic music I understood this way that the two people talk differently to each other when they are among themselves. Always more tender no matter which two people it were. But once there are at least three people the dynamics change for the worse.At the beginning I found the film quite alien because of the apparent disjointness of the scenes but the better I knew the characters the more drawn in I was and I soon started to get something out of most scenes. It was also alien because I was not used to the way they talk. Pretty stagy in pronunciation and phrasing. This could possibly be contributed to the fact that the cast and writerdirector Fassbinder all came from theater with little film experience at that point.There was no sense of time. It just goes from one conversation to another. From the dialogue you could gather that a lot of time passed overall but it isn't really important to know how much. It was just important for the movie so to not have the plot stagnating to see different sides of the characters. Although it could also be argued again that you don't get a sense of time passing because Fassbinder didn't yet know any better since he was rather new to the medium of film.".

	onyx:emotionText "I think in big parts the film is about dynamics. Different couples with different dynamics. One couple in which the man treats his woman harshly one in which he treats her more tenderly until he is eager for more money and one in which the woman has the upper hand in the household apparently because she brings home the money. Yet they all seem to be in love with their partner and they are all friends with each other.Money also plays an important role overall. Those who have money are more oppressive and dominating. As if having money gives one more of a right to tell your partner what he or she should do in things that have nothing to do with money. Two of the men consider doing something illegal that should bring big bucks. This was the cause for some quarrels with their women who found the idea appealing but didn't want to risk it.

It struck me that RWF filmed all of these scenes one after the other in keeping with the motto of their clan of actors Cheaper Faster Better. or something like that. If you notice there's the same car parked in the background and it appears the scenes were all shot about the same time of day. Next! The Peer Raben waltz is so beautiful.

	schema:reviewBody "And with that description I also include myself. Katzelmacher is an early career work by German writer and director Rainer Werner Fassbinder. He was in his early 20s still when he made this one and you see by the fact that it is in blackandwhite that it's from early in his career one of his first two full feature films. The cast includes a handful of actors that he worked with on a regular basis most of all the really young Hanna Schygulla. It's a West German production and of course in German language. Here we have a film that will have its 50th anniversary soon. It runs for approximately 90 minutes and thus is among Fassbinder's shorter works. But I also feel it is among his more difficult to access. I struggled with caring for the characters at all possibly because the focus is entirely on the dialogues here and very rarely only on what the characters are doing. It's all about the talk. One major plot point is how they deal with a Greek immigrant which makes it a pretty current issue too how they talk without respect about him on some occasions but try to get together with him when they are alone with him. I am talking about the women of course. The Greek guy is played by Fassbinder himself and he is once again a scene stealer. His scenes were the best of the entire film. This movie received a great deal of awards recognition and it was a major success for Fassbinder especially with the German Film Awards almost half a century later. But like I said it's a very bleak sterile movie that is certainly not for everybody possibly not the best choice to start getting into Fassbinder.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's not that much plot to Katzelmacher but it's interesting the way it is. We're kind of looking at the late 60's German equivalent of what we might've seen in the 90's with certain movies Clerks the Linklater efforts Kids where we just see people hanging out and talking but never about things that will really change their lives or affect them. This is accurate to disaffected youth though Fassbinder makes it a little sexually charged here and there  nothing explicit but there are some relationships that have fits and starts mostly fits  and a 'new' person. A Greek man comes as a newcomer and he's not really welcome. This makes up the conflict though it doesn't seem that way at first.It's tough to fully recall why the group turns on this Greek guy  maybe he said something or did something that made them turn or it was his funny accent or way of speaking I certainly remember the latter as it was one of those things that stuck out  but the point is clear. Alienation drives so many of Fassbinder's story and it's not simply the characters but the style itself here that gives off an alienating vibe. We see many shots that are just static on these guys Fassbinder being one of them in the cast hanging around sitting down smoking talking aimless and then it'll cut to a shot of two women walking and talking in an apartment complex and these are the only shots where music comes up the same tinny piano music by the way. It's in this atmosphere in black and white no less that things that look AND feel the same all the time can get disrupted by just one character.I don't know if this is really among the director's best and it's best I think to look at it as an early experiment. Certainly things he's dealing with here he'd explore throughout the rest of his career. It's not particularly engaging in the way of ABC unfold. You're just watching this very slow moving car wreck that's unfolding in a way that doesn't seem like it. Again akin to one of those lowkey character studies that would pop up in American independent cinema decades later. But it is interesting for what it is especially if you can be open to its intended aim of being about aimlessness and the way that underneath that is a lot of darkness.".

Vittorio Gassman serves as a double agent who does the kidnapping and the Americans come to the 'rescue' and the scientist is eternally grateful. This first episode lives up to the title.A clue that takes us into the other is found in the first and second stories. In the second one two nuclear powered submarines are on top secret maneuvers in the Gulf of Aden and French Intelligence takes this story as Bourvil foils a plot to take them out by a pair of double agents working for his country's spy service. Comic actor Bourvil proves surprisingly adept at a role with few laughs.The third episode is the weakest. It has little dialog but when Henry Fonda opens his mouth he sounds no more convincing as a deep cover CIA agent than he did as a Russian in War And Peace. This one is a no frills espionage film and the life of a spy certainly isn't what Ian Flemming made it out to be. It's been little seen since it's initial release and for completists of the work of Henry Fonda and Robert Ryan that is a pity. The overall narrative between the three stories is structured nicely and the players even the terribly miscast Fonda all deliver sincere performances.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been reading the comments page in a somewhat bemused fashion.  It seems to be divided between people who don't like the movie because it's not enough like the original graphic novel and people who don't like it because they've never heard of half of the characters that are members of the League.  The latter seems to me to be an unutterably silly reason for disliking a film.  Does nobody read the classics anymore?  Nobody reads Oscar Wilde Bram Stoker Robert Louis Stevenson Jules Verne H.G. Wells or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?  I find that difficult to believe.  As to the formernot enough like the graphic novel in other wordsjust how in the heck can a screenwriter accommodate the dark and twisted visions of Alan Moore in a twohour Hollywood movie anyway?     I don't believe that one can compare anything written by Alan Moore to what ends up on the screen being ostensibly based on the graphic novel. The same applies to FROM HELL which is another one most people pan and one which I think is underappreciated even though the style is breathtaking.  I don't even want to think about the reaction that will ensue once THE WATCHMEN comes out!       What seems to have been missed by most people is that this movie is about style as opposed to substance.  It's based on a graphic novel.  That's a fancy way of saying it's based on a comic book.  On that level the film succeeds admirably.  The characters are archetypes of their literary forbears.  They aren't supposed to be strictly speaking human.  Of course the plot is grandiose impractical and overthetop.  Hello?  Aren't most comic books like that?  Good heavens isn't most of STAR WARS?     I don't claim that this is a masterpiece.  I do claim that's it's fun to watch if one approaches it with a willing suspension of disbelief.  For a couple of bucks shelled out at the DVD rental shop it takes one to a different world for close to two hours.  On that level it's worth a rental. It's also worth a rental once one watches the movie to listen to the commentary from various actors and to realize just how well these socalled unknowns do assorted accents that aren't even close to their own.  Plus the golfing anecdotes are amusing.  And I don't even like golfing.     This ain't CASABLANCA.  Nor is it TITANIC for which I eternally thank the gods.  Now THERE was an overhyped piece of inaccurate trash that pretended to be history but I digress.  But it's kind of fun anyway as long as one doesn't take it too seriously.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was badly criticised by many critics and fans... I don't believe that the movie's quality was 'low' but i detect two reasons1. 'what? automobiles submarines rockets tanks automatic rifles explosions that sank Venice? all those in 1899? no way!'OK those people maybe don't know that the movie is based on a comic book!! The comic book is fantasy it is in an alternate JulesVernelike universe where all fiction was real... That book and this movie belong to the genre 'Steampunk' a movement that is interested in presenting an alternate Victorian age with an extraevolved steam driven science that never actually existed. IF you read the comic you will see that a bridge that connects England and France technology made by Tesla and Edison zeppelins airships antigravity devices... some of these are indeed mentioned in science fiction works of that time and since the comic is set in that kind of universe then all these are real.The book and the movie don't want to convince you that these events actually happened in 1899. The movie doesn't want to tell you that Venice was halfsunk by an explosion and was later rebuilt. It is just another universe an alternate reality... it's fantasy!there have been some Steampunk movies and were never considered serious for example Van Helsing and Wild Wild West. They were too much too unreal... but if you accept that they happen in a Steampunk universe you will enjoy themi suggest you make a search for 'Steampunk' online.. Wikipedia is a good startnow to the other reason2. 'LXG is not faithful to the comic book'no it wasn't but they didn't want to adapt THE book into a movie! can someone who watched Spiderman 2 tell me on WHICH issue of the spiderman comic book series that movie was adapted?Spiderman 1 and 2 and all the comicbook movies are not trying to adapt a certain issue of the Spidey series into a movie they try to compress some events and characters from Spidey's universe and present them combined on screeni don't think that LXG was less faithful to the comic book than Spiderman or Batman were to their respective originals... LXG wanted to tell a story that happened in a universe similar to that of the 'League' comic book not a certain story of the series..i hope that if all could understand this they would enjoy this movie as it really should be enjoyed".

	schema:headline " A film that deserved a better fate";
	schema:reviewBody "Many times film have such bad vibes during production that they are rumored to be a terrible mess before they have a chance to premiere.  Some films that suffered this fate during filming were The Godfather and Titanic.  Both turned out to be box office bonanzas and the trouble they had making it to the big screen was quickly forgotten. Then there are films like Valley of the Dolls and Myra Breckinridge which were legendary for their on the set squabbles and dissension among cast members.  The end product of both of those productions were films that should have won awards for being the ultimate in cinema stinkers.  In 2003 we are given The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen which had already become legendary for it's problems between director Stephen Norrington and lead actor Sean Connery. Add to that such disasters as a flood wiping out production in Prague and you have a nation full of critics ready to pounce.  And film critics being what they are in not wanting to waste an opportunity pounce they did making it one of the worst reviewed films in the past year.  Add to that the fact that Fox made the mistake of pitting it against Pirates of the Caribbean in it's opening weekend and it you have the makings of a box office disaster. Did League deserve it?  No it's a film that in my opinion is fun highly watchable and deserved none of the over the top blasting it took from some critics.  Maybe if it had come out after Gigli many would have looked more kindly on it.League has an extraordinary premise for a fantasyadventure film. The idea of using legendary figures from literary fiction to combat a madman The Fantom who is out to destroy the world is much more original than the sequel based films such as Tomb Raider and Terminator 3 that we were subjected to this summer.  League is based on a comic book series that I have not read nor if I had would not use as a comparison.  Our team of intrepid super heroes consists of Alan Quartermain Sean Connery Captain Nemo Naseeruddin Shah a now vampiress Mina Harker Peta Wilson The Invisible Man Tony Curran Dorian Gray Stuart Townsend Tom Sawyer Shane West and Dr JekyllMr. Hyde Jason Flyming.  The cast does an excellent job of bringing each character to life.  Connery has been highly criticized for his portrayal of Quartermain but for those who cannot appreciate his presence I suggest you try watching Richard Chamberlain in the same role in his two films.  That'll teach you.  Peta Wilson gives Mina Harker a strong seductive personality that reeks of sexual tension.  Stuart Townsend manages to make Dorian Gray the most watchable of the characters by surrounding the character in an aura filled with flair and Mystery.  Jason Flyming brings a new characterization of a tormented Dr. Jekyll who as Mr. Hyde is transformed into a creature Bruce Banner would be proud of.  Shane West exudes a boyish charm as Tom Sawyer befitting his character.  Though seldom seen except in covering makeup Tony Curran manages to give the Invisible Man an unmistakable personality.  If there was a flaw in the casting I would have to say it was Shah as Captain Nemo.  His characterization is for the most part one note and empty devoid of personality.The story moves along at a nice even pace.  It quickly introduces the characters so that we are able to get to know their personalities then moves ahead with the action. Writer James Robinson and director Norrington make equal use of each of the characters abilities so that none of their talents are wasted.  The production design set decoration and art direction are all top notch giving us a dark and brooding turn of the century look we haven't seen before.  There are the usual minor plot holes and flaws one could find if they took the time to study this film but films like this weren't made for film class.  For that you watch Citizen Kane.  Films like League are made for an audience to have a good time while loading up on the popcorn and soda and nothing more.  And I did have a good time.  After the critical blasting League took in the press I steered clear of it for quite a while.  Fortunately several months later I gave it a chance and am certainly glad I did.  I suggest you do the same.My Grade B".

This is a fun escapist fantasy and all of my favorite literary characters are in great form. I had a truly wonderful time watching LXG.

While there were major differences between the characters and the books they were taken from for the most part it was like seeing old friends i knew what the various characters would do becuase they kept the proper personalities.  I even figured out who the villian was because I noticed one of the major works of victorian literature that was missing from the movie. And you do not need to have read all of these books to understand the movie but there is a bit of a lack of character developement that you may find but my friends who hadn't done the reading also enjoyed the movie.It has great visual effects some really good action sequences and a really nice looking car.  Oh if you know anything about these characters and other victorian books see if you can catch the little references they toss.  I recomend this movie for someone who wants a good adventure movie.".

And you do not need to have read all of these books to understand the movie but there is a bit of a lack of character developement that you may find but my friends who hadn't done the reading also enjoyed the movie.It has great visual effects some really good action sequences and a really nice looking car.  Oh if you know anything about these characters and other victorian books see if you can catch the little references they toss.  I recomend this movie for someone who wants a good adventure movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "Sean Connery is a very distinguished actor. He has appeared in several great films spanning decades. He was the original 007 James Bond and has since made his mark on the American Cinema. His way or presenting a line is uncanny. Connery is a real hero. His character Allan Quartermain is no different.The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen shows the world during the turn of the century 1900. The dawn of a new era is about to begin as the world changes into the industrial mechanized age. New technologies are being developed and Europe is gripped with terror. The man known as The Fantom is toying with England and Germnay starting what seems like a war between the two. Desperate times call for desperate measures. Allan Quartermain is picked to lead a team of select individuals on an expedition to find and stop The Fantom. Allan is teamed up with Captain Nemo Naseeruddin Shah Mina Harker Peta Wilson Tom Sawyer Shane West Dorian Grey Stuart Townsend Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde Jason Flemyng and Rodney Skinner known as The Invisible Man Tony Curran.This movie features a team of famous characters of literature that suit this period. The idea for the film is very ingenious. Most movies of heroes and people with special talents center around figures from today not from yesterday. Although some of the characters might not be recognizable to children they don't really have to know about them. This isn't the best kids movie with scenes of intense action and some not too pleasant graphics Dr Jekyll to Mr. Hyde transformation. This movie could have been so much more. For some reason it just didn't click. The cast does an OK job of bringing these characters to life but there was room for improvement. Sometimes the effects overtake the story and bring down the whole movie.It is an enjoyable movie but isn't for everyone. It's a good adventure and a decent picture all together. It's nothing to special but it doesn't hurt to watch. Connery is good as the aging Quartermain and with the fatherson relationship with West there is more to just the cat and mouse adventure. LXG is a pleasant film that could have been truly extraordinary.".

When was the last time you saw a movie with an attractive woman and the sex angle wasn't played up?she kept her clothes on?  Mina Harker is important as a character not as a sexpot.  Points to the director.The same actually extends to other characters.  They are people rather than just cutouts used to further the plot with the exception of the invisible manbut then they cut his role because to expand it might have meant following Alan Moore closely and making him a rapista move that they just weren't quite ready to go for in a PG13 movie apparently. Hyde is genuinely creepy.  Nemo is authentic.  Far more authentic than any other movie adaptation of 1000 Leagues Under the Sea.  Dorian Gray is terrifically portrayed although the whole 'face the painting' noncontinuity really was poor why not just have her stab the painting?But bottom line all the characters were true to the books.  The dialogue wasn't forced nothing was forced down your throat.  Some people complained that the plot was 'hard to follow' do these same people complain when an action film beats you over the head with its plot?  Finally a director who understands subtlety and how to lead a plot so it comes out naturally and they complain!  Bah!And the plot is complex believe me.  More complex than it appears.  The way it is naturally expanded and the way it flows may fool you into accepting it as simple even dead but it is not.  The richness of the deception the horrible betrayal which should be obvious to anyone with more than a passing knowledge of the classics from which these characters comeit all comes together to suddenly make sense.  Suddenly scenes that were strange scenes that seemed heroic even the slightly romantic scenes become different.  Creepy.The action is terrific and the music is haunting.  My only complaint is that the movie was too short.  Another ten minutes establishing M another ten minutes of interaction between these complex and rich characters...alas.My only hope is a bevy of sequels.  Characters and universe's this rich and complex deserve sequels.9 out of 10 stars only because it was too short and they toned down the darkness a little bit for the PG13 audience".

While i would not recommend it as a must see movie I certainly didn't find it to be a waste of my time. Sure some plot points could have been developed morebetter but hey I didn't walk in expecting Shakespeare.  Though I haven't read the graphic novel on which the film is based I have read that both the graphic novel and the movie take place in a reality alternate from both out history and our literary canons which means that even though Stoker never wrote Mina as turning into a vampire it's okay for LXG to take the license to do so. And so on and so forth.Yes it would have been nice to see Connery make his character a little more swashbuckling. But maybe that was the writing.  I almost loathe watching anything with Peta Wilson but i found here surprisingly interesting in this movie.  In fact other than Tom Sawyer's character seeming a bit incomprehensible I think the other Leaguers were pretty interesting.  But what was the deal with the bad guy M? I thought his M.O. was even more pointless and less fleshedout out than any of the flattest Bond villains I've had the displeasure of seeing.  It was just a badly written character.Just a word or two about the Mr. Hyde FX the CGI wizards of the Hulk could take a clue. Sure both characters were CGI rendered but Mr. Hyde's size carried a credible degree of mass and weight whereas the Hulk often moved as if massless making him seem too two dimensional.All in all I give the movie a respectable 610.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was one of my most anticipated movies.  I love Connery and the premise of this was great.  A Indiana Jones setting for adventure six great characters from classic fiction and a good story.Somehow these elements were lost in the presentation.  The story is supposedly based on a graphic novel comic book by Alan Moore but the departures from the original story are too numerous.  Sadly not only the storyline is abandoned but the style and flair is as well.The entire movie is far too dark.  I'm so tired of dark and atmospheric becoming just a vehicle for covering up lousy sets and fx.  The action sequences are fake and choppy as the director decides on fast editing rather than skilled choreography.This is a period piece set in 1899 but there are a lot of continuity errors.  They refer to the car as a car for example though they didn't know what it was.For his part Connery does fine.  But he really always does.  Connery doesn't really act he's simply himself each time.  Thus you won't see much difference between James Bond and Allan Quatermain.  You will see a huge difference however in the quality of the Connery Bond movies and LXE.The other characters were fun at times but they either ended up underused poorly portrayed or just odd.Wilson's Harker character was very confusing.  Was she a vampire?  If so what of the old mythos about not being out in sunlight?  She walks around on the deck of the Nautilus in broad daylight.  Not sure where all the bats came from either particularly in the Arctic.I liked Dr. Jekyll best I suppose.  However his character left a lot to be desired as well.  He comments early after Mr. Hyde saves the Nautilus not to make a saint out of a sinner yet the movie does just that.  Hyde is never portrayed as vicious or evil.  He's either running frightened of Connery's gun or eagerly lending his hand to the good guys.  Uhhh...Tom Sawyer as an American Secret Service agent.  Nah didn't really work. Dorian Gray was a waste as well.  A deep character that they didn't bother exploring at all.  Nemo was terribly underused.In better hands this would have been a much better movie.  It had a lot of things going for it in casting plot and premise... but they made it stale and flat.  Too bad.5 out of 10.".

It had a lot of things going for it in casting plot and premise... but they made it stale and flat.  Too bad.5 out of 10.";

Mr. Hyde looks like a cousin to the Hulk Dorian Gray is an immortal? but the movie itself looks great there are plenty of incredible special effects and surprisingly some bad ones and it moves so quickly that you really don't have time to stop and think about it.  Just ignore logic plot and characterizations lean back and let the movie sweep over you.  There's a fight or action scene every 5 or 10 minutes or soyou won't be bored.All the acting is pretty goodConnery is excellent as always as Quatermain and Peta Wilson makes a very sexy vampire.  The only bad acting comes surprisingly from two good actorsStuart Townsend is very dull as Dorian Grey and Shane West is way out of his league as Tom Sawyer.  The scenes between him and Connery are almost embarassing to watchConnery is acting rings around him.Sois it a good movie?  No but it is an enjoyable one.

I have now seen the film and am not just relieved but elated.  Yes there are departures from Moore's work but that's to be expected and is certainly not uncommon look at the SpiderMan and XMen movies if you don't believe me.  However the general spirit of the comic is retained and the personalities of the characters in the film are with only a couple of understandable exceptions deadon in line with those of the book.  Not only that but the movie does a perfect job of capturing the oldfashioned futuristic feel of Moore's work from the settings to the technology.  In fact my only complaint is that a little too much screen time was devoted to Quatermain Sean Connery at the expense of the other charactersa pity as each one of them with the possible exception of Sawyer truly is extraordinary and very much worth exploring indepth.Overall I found this film cool quirky and utterly enjoyable.".

Even though many hate this movie for making the whole concept more family oriented it is the main reason that this movie is so hated at times.

Titzie an aspiring actress and Ibo's German girlfriend finds she's pregnant. Ibo is uncertain about fatherhood  compounded by his father's disowning him for getting a German girl pregnant  so Titzie sends him packing. He makes attempts at getting it right but as the birth approaches he's still not ready. In the background are three thugs in search of good tripe soup and a CapuletMontegue feud between the kebab joint and a Greek taverna across the street. Can Ibo be the glove upon that hand?";

But in the whole mix you've got tradition family values a Kebab shop and a Greek taverna kung fu and William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. In a way the film is a modern RJ...but it would paradoxically be unfair to label it only as such as it is much more. More than an amusing gettogether of events and characters and more than a social satire. It's a film with soul and most importantly it's original an authentic in both storyline and plot as well as presentation. In addition to this the characters are extremely likable although they aren't always played at what I felt could have been their maximum potential. But ultimately that doesn't even matter.Because with all these elements cleverly and humorously brought together the Kebab Connection may well be a small milestone in German comedy. It's worthy all the way. If it hadn't been what would that say about faith?".

One of the motifs I found to be most striking was the sort of comingofage. The audience can root for Ibo the main character because he is portrayed as morally good and we follow him in his pursuit of responsibility and worthiness of a child and Titzi. The motif of cosmopolitanism and the blending of cultures was approached in a lighthearted manor. We see Ibo's struggle to please his father who is both supportive of Titzi and rejecting to Ibo. The efforts Ibo makes to please Titzi including lessening his societally deemed masculinity is refreshing because it is not accompanied by a complete loss of his Turkish culture it was important for the cosmopolitan discourse for him to not lose his Turkish culture as a result of integration. The most interesting aspect I found in Kebab Connection was the film team's use of film inside the film. The use of Ibo's commercials in plot development and exposure of the underlying story to other characters is very clever. The second way the filminfilm technique was used was to show the internal discourse within Ibo. I feel that this is often a great challenge of directors to discretely show the thought progression of the characters. I felt when watching that this internal peek was effective in both making Ibo more likable and it made it easier for me to root for him and allowing the audience to follow his development.

It's very enjoyable and succeeds in communicating a positive social message about intercultural harmony.Ibo initially avoids his responsibilities as an expecting father in a western society that strives for gender equality. His behavior exemplifies the stereotypical Turkish father unwilling to assume some of the duties associated with the traditionally feminine role of raising children. While he eventually mans up and commits to being a good father the film gets laughs from poking fun at his struggle to do so. For example he lets a stroller purchased by his pregnant girlfriend roll down a hill to avoid being seen with it. Another interesting characteristic of the film is Ibo's lack of a strong Turkish of German identity. Contrary to what one might expect in a film dealing with TurkishGerman cultural differences Ibo's greatest cultural identification seems to be with Hollywood Kung Fu films. Ibo is a Kung Fu film fanatic and the commercials created by Ibo shown in the film are affectionate parodies of the genre employing its conventions to sell fast food.

	schema:headline " The best German film about a Turkish man who wants to make the first German martial arts epic!";
	schema:reviewBody "Okay. I'll admit that this is probably the only German film about a Turkish man wanting to make a martial arts epic...or at least the only one I've seen! But it is quite enjoyable and sillyand worth your time.Before I get to the review the history teacher in me wants to point out to the nonGerman viewers out there that Germans of Turkish extraction are very commonand make up one of the largest minority groups in the country probably the largest. So seeing a film about Turks in Germany is a natural. And for those who don't realize it OFTEN Turks and Greeks do NOT get alongthey have a long and tumultuous history together and this will help you understand some of the antipathy in the film between the two restaurant owners.Ibrahim is a strange young man. He is a very talented director of commercials for his uncle's Turkish restaurant. But they are NOT typical commercialsthey are like minimartial arts filmscomplete with wirefu and stuntsall to advertise for a sandwich shop!! The customers love the ads and life looks very promising for this odd filmmaker. However he also is VERY immaturevery. And when his girlfriend Titzi becomes pregnant he seems about as happy as a cannibal who is given tofu! Naturally Titzi is very upsetas are Ibrahim's parents who naturally want him to marry a Turkish lady. Can all this get sorted out?! And what of his uncle's competitor across the street? Can this Greek restaurant owner convince Ibrahim to make some ads for him as well? And are any film producers crazy enough to give the guy a chance at directing a feature film? I liked this filmit was quirky and funny. So why do I give it a 7 and not something higher? Well Ibrahim is a jerk and VERY immatureso much so that although you might like him in some ways it's also easy to dislike him. Seeing his lack of commitment to the pregnant girlfriend is pretty sadand makes it hard to like him. This is a serious problem in a romanticcomedy! But on balance the good still outweighs the bad and the film is well worth your time.".

	onyx:emotionText "Okay. I'll admit that this is probably the only German film about a Turkish man wanting to make a martial arts epic...or at least the only one I've seen! But it is quite enjoyable and sillyand worth your time.Before I get to the review the history teacher in me wants to point out to the nonGerman viewers out there that Germans of Turkish extraction are very commonand make up one of the largest minority groups in the country probably the largest. So seeing a film about Turks in Germany is a natural. And for those who don't realize it OFTEN Turks and Greeks do NOT get alongthey have a long and tumultuous history together and this will help you understand some of the antipathy in the film between the two restaurant owners.Ibrahim is a strange young man. He is a very talented director of commercials for his uncle's Turkish restaurant. But they are NOT typical commercialsthey are like minimartial arts filmscomplete with wirefu and stuntsall to advertise for a sandwich shop!! The customers love the ads and life looks very promising for this odd filmmaker. However he also is VERY immaturevery. And when his girlfriend Titzi becomes pregnant he seems about as happy as a cannibal who is given tofu! Naturally Titzi is very upsetas are Ibrahim's parents who naturally want him to marry a Turkish lady. Can all this get sorted out?! And what of his uncle's competitor across the street? Can this Greek restaurant owner convince Ibrahim to make some ads for him as well? And are any film producers crazy enough to give the guy a chance at directing a feature film? I liked this filmit was quirky and funny. So why do I give it a 7 and not something higher? Well Ibrahim is a jerk and VERY immatureso much so that although you might like him in some ways it's also easy to dislike him. Seeing his lack of commitment to the pregnant girlfriend is pretty sadand makes it hard to like him. This is a serious problem in a romanticcomedy! But on balance the good still outweighs the bad and the film is well worth your time.";

Occasionally though we do see one that peeks are interests and gives us more than we expected. This is exactly how I felt about Kebab Connection.The movie is somewhat of a mixed bag when it comes to narrative. It falls somewhere between comedy action and social drama leading to an interesting variety of scenes. We have emotional moments between protagonist Ibo Denis Moschitto and his family Ibo's struggle to grow up and become mature enough for his upcoming role as a father witty dialogue with some slapstick comedy tossed in and that's all topped off by the sporadic kung fu tossed into the film.The film follows Ibo as he strives to follow his dream and become the first director of a German produced kung fu film. After directing two wildly popular commercials for his uncle's kebab restaurant Ibo finally sees a chance at achieving his dream. Ibo faces many challenges along the way such as impregnating his girlfriend and dealing with the many problems his family create as well. Through all of this we see Ibo struggle with his maturity and self image as he must face the problems he has in order to keep his family and fulfill his dream.While Kebab Connection certainly isn't any blockbuster film it was an enjoyable watch for me at least. If you have some free time maybe give it a watch you'll get a few good laughs in as well as some enjoyable feel good moments as well.".

His father is played very good by Gven Kirac also very believable and authentic and no clich type like Hasan Ali Mete's performance of Ibo's uncle. Nora Tschirner is without a doubt extremely beautiful but her acting is more than boring and so is her character in the movie. When the first half is over it's getting pretty bad. The whole babystuff is pathetic and exaggerated. Only total stupidos will see this as funny. Than you're asking yourself the whole time why the hell everything is that complicated why Ibo cannot meet Titzi anymore. It's meant to be romantic and tragic at this part but it just doesn't work! A good director would have sensed that but Anno Saul obviously lost the overview on the story. It's just scene after scene after scene without dramaturgy or any empathy.

	schema:reviewBody "To begin with the end note When the anonymous memoir adapted here 'Anonyma  Eine Frau in Berlin' was published in Switzerland in 1959 it was greeted with such outrage among Germans the author allowed no further editions she of course never revealed her name. Here we are fifty years later and the material is still incendiary and hard to get your head around. It concerns events that are unspeakable and incomprehensible.As played by the strikingly handsome elegant Nina Hoss Anonyma is an ash blond who can wear odds and ends as if they were couturier fashions a journalist fluent in French and Russian at home in Paris and London who comes back from assignment to be in the Fhrer's capital for the final victory she still believes in. The Third Reich for her and her pals seems a time of freshness and energy for Germany. The war is just a blip on the horizon soon to be done with. She parties with fellow supporters of the Fatherland's great endeavor who toast the troops and boast that the buffoonish Russians will fall by the wayside. They don't and when they invade Berlin and begin the wholesale raping of the German women she chooses to mete out her favors selectively for her own protection and that of her neighbors in the apartment building. This is the story of how that happens.When Berlin crumbles apartment dwellers are hiding in the basement like ghosts then like condemned men and women given an uneasy reprieve they return to living in the remnants of apartments. Anonyma moves in with a group of others in a large flat and turns over the studio she occupied with her absent soldier boyfriend Gerd August Diehl for whom she keeps a diary of what happens to an unrepentantly Nazi young woman and the adolescent German soldier boyfriend she hides Sebastian Urzendowsky who is armed. This unwise gesture is the pistol we know will go off eventually endangering everybody.The film shows only two public events the invasion and the official German declaration that the Germans have surrendered Berlin. The period in between is the main focus of the diary and the film. It's not specified but it was about three months.The film focuses on a handful of neighbors who include  two lively sisters Joerdis Triebel Rosalie Thomass a strongwilled widow Irm Hermann an elderly bookseller Katharina Blaschke a liquor dealer Maria Hartmann a pair of lesbian lovers Sandra Hueller Isabell Gerschke a refugee girl in hiding Anne Kanis and a stolid octogenarian Erni Mangold. And there are more not to mention a half dozen clearly defined Russians including the high ranking officer's Mongolian guard.It's a bit difficult to keep track of all these and Woman in Berlin is best at making us feel close to the narrator and conveying a sense of the chaos and uncertainty when the invasion and the raping begin. There seems to be no control. It's hard to see that anything is going on. The Russians are just there wandering free and brutalizing the German women. When these women meet the question they ask each other is not whether but How often? Anonyma sleeps with various Russians willingly and not. Protesting the violations and seeking a protective officer she first becomes involved with Anatol Roman Gribkov a pretty frivolous man who turns out to be not a career soldier but a dairyman. He comes and goes and is no real help. She calls him a gypsy. Then she finds a battalion commander Major Rybkin the excellent charismatic Yevgeni Sidikhin who is unresponsive when she confronts him boldly in front of a lot of Russian soldiers and then comes around to find her. Unlike the Germans she says later in her diary which we see her constantly scribbling in pencil the Russians appreciate an educated woman.A strength of the film is that it alternates naturally between noise and violence drunken celebration when Russians and Germans fraternize in the big apartment and love which has lost its usual meaning but lingers on. These extremes never seem overwrought or manipulative. Here's a time when in a film the fact that nothing makes sense makes sense. The protagonist recognizes that in the eyes of many she is now a whore but she questions what a whore is. Marguerite Duras' screenplay for 'Hiroshima Mon Amour' is poetic and overwrought ut in its rhythmic repetitions it strongly conveys a sense of the aftermath of trauma isn't found in the somewhat overlong 'Woman in Berlin' which is simply about the confusion of daytosurvival in a world where morality is turned on its head. As Anonyma knew however and as we see in the film the defeated must capitulate or die and the invaders have suffered horribly too. One young soldier reconts in Russian demanding that she translate to all present how invading Germans brutally slaughtered all the children in his village while he watched. Even Andreij's wife has been killed by the Germans. And the film shows the range of the then Russian people the Ukrainians Caucasians Mongols who are to be the Soviet Union.Though reviewers and commentators seem to think they know what all this material means and proclaim judgments if not on the protagonist on the filmmaker this is primarily an example of Germans taking hard looks at repressed material that formerly was too ugly to examine. This isn't an impassioned indictment or defense but a movie that uses an extraordinary diary only published in Germany in 2003 to present an admirably complex picture of a crazy time. If it is both remarkable in its focus and at times quite old fashioned in its methods that's as good a way as any to get things across. The result is both specific and widereaching because there's ample time to ponder a basic issue for civilians in wartime what does it cost you to survive?".

	schema:reviewBody "ANONYMA  EINE FRAU IN BERLIN A Woman In Berlin is the painfully sensitive title of this exquisite film from writerdirector Max Frberbck based on a once occult book by 'Anonyma' that has become a recent bestseller in Germany. It has the courage to tell the story of what it was like in Berlin as World War II was ending  the time of the Russian siege of the city just before and just after Hitler committed suicide ending the horror of the Nazi regime. While many films have been made about the German populace and how they coped with the fall of their 'great Third Reich' country that was to rule the planet few have been able to allow the audience to understand the brutalities of war on the people of Germany in so direct a fashion. It is a film that will haunt the viewer for a long time a film that will restore some dignity to the German people who lived through it not being part of Hitler's madness but being trapped in the ugliness that followed his fall. Anonyma Nina Hoss is a journalist a pretty woman living in the cellars and other hiding places while the Russians took over Berlin. She helps her fellow survivors of the bombing of Berlin struggling for food and protection. The Russian soldiers still angry with the gnawing hatred for the Germans from the Siege of Leningrad and the loathing of anything that exists in Hitler's Berlin drink heavily and seek out the women from hiding to satisfy their insatiable lust. 'Berlin is a German whorehouse' and all women from children to youngsters to elderly fraus are continually raped and beaten as part of the victors' rage. Anonyma speaks several languages including Russian and decides her only hope for survival is to align with the Commander of the troops Major Andreij Rybkin Yevgeni Sidikhin believing that if she becomes his concubine she will be safe from the random raping by the rest of the soldiers. Their liaisons become more than outlets for the Major and the two gradually bond despite the horrors outside their rendezvous. They survive. Hitler commits suicide and the war is over and the two face the reality of returning to their previous prewar lives...or can they? Nina Hoss is brilliant in this difficult role and though the script allows her little to say she conveys so much through her expressions that words are nearly unnecessary. Likewise Yevgeni Sidikhin captures the dichotomy of emotional response his character must display finding just the right balance between the conquering Russian soldier and the compassionate and vulnerable lover. The cinematography by Benedict Neuenfels captures the devastation not only of the buildings but also of the emotions of both sides of the participating groups and Zbigniew Preisner is responsible for the musical score that adds immeasurably to the drama. This is one of the great German films that took many years of maturing to make. It should be seen. Grady Harp".

The acting performances are spoton. This has some marvelous little touches and details and it is historically accurate. The characters are complex and psychologically credible. This is immensely wellproduced. The camerawork and editing put you right in the situation when this fits and is in general expertly done. This has extraordinary lighting. There are a few light portions that keep it from being all sadwithout it taking away from how touching and engaging the rest of it is. It is tense and unpleasant when it means to be albeit it isn't outright depressing. The atmosphere is built up well. There is a bit of moderate sexuality nudity of both genders brutal violence and disturbing content in this. The DVD comes with a trailer for this and ones for other films.

	schema:reviewBody "'A Woman in Berlin' is set in the last days of World War II as the Soviet Army wreaks vengeance upon the German civilian population following their invasion of the German capital. The main recipient of the soldiers' wrath are the women of Berlin who they end up raping in great numbers. The focus of the movie is one woman Anonyma who attempts to survive in the midst of great degradation and humiliation. 'A Woman in Berlin' is based on the a truelife anonymous diary which was published in West Germany in 1959. At that time the diary created a scandal where the German public could not accept the graphic descriptions of women as rape victims. The author withdrew her work from publication for approximately four decades until it was republished and accepted by a new generation of Germans.At the beginning of the film in a flashback we see Anonyma in her earlier life as a journalist and unrepentant supporter of the Nazi cause. After the Soviet invasion Anonyma takes refuge in an apartment building where she's given shelter by an older woman. In one harrowing scene after another the brutish Russian soldiers raid the apartment building and seek out their female victims. Some women are dragged off the street and raped in dark hallways or alleyways. Unlike the other residents of her building Anonyma speaks Russian and at first attempts to appeal to someone in charge to stop the brutality. When she approaches one officer and asks to speak to someone in charge he asks who do you want to speak towe're all commanders here. When she finally gets to speak to an officer he asks her why she's so upset indifferently and nonchalantly pointing out that the rapes only take a few minutes.After Anonyma is raped herself she's determined not to be violated again. She first seeks out a lower ranking soldier Anatol as a protector but then moves on to Major Andrei Rybkin who is educated like her and they end up forming a bond together. Meanwhile as the Russian Army gains more control the residents of the apartment building begin forming more of a relationship with their occupiers. The Russians come off as more complex as they first appear especially in regards to their interactions with the apartment residents.The dtente between the two groups is shattered when a Russian soldier discovers that a young woman a Nazi sympathizer has been shielding a young German Solder who is in possession of a gun and a hand grenade. The Russian solder throws the German over the stairway landing and he plunges to his death stories below. When Anonyma admits that she was aware that the couple had been hiding in the attic the Major refuses to bring her up on charges. The Major is castigated by his men and eventually he is removed from his command and either sent to Siberia or executed it's not clear what is his exact fate.The film ends when Anonyma's soldierboyfriend returns from the front and she gives him her diary to read she has been addressing it to him all along. The boyfriend wants nothing to do with Anonyma as he ashamed that she was raped. The implication is that she allowed herself to be subjected to the humiliation and is now forever a 'marked woman'. The boyfriend takes off leaving Anonyma to fend for herself. I question how the boyfriend could have ended up back home without being taken into custody by the Russians who were rounding up all exsoldiers and shipping them off to imprisonment in the Soviet Union.'A Woman in Berlin' commendably handles the rape scenes in a matteroffact way. There is nothing salacious about these depictions as the focus is more on how the women maintain their dignity in the face of all the depravity. Oftentimes the women use humor to brunt the feelings of pain and humiliationother times they express detached objectivity one woman greets a friend on the street and asks how many?The film does suggest a number of times that there is a reason for the Russian soldiers' brutish behavior. A German woman tells another that had the Russians did what our soldiers did to them we would all be dead by now. In another good scene Anonyma is called upon to translate a Russian soldier's account of the massacre of his family by Germans. And finally it's revealed that Andrei's own wife was killed by German soldiers. Still some kind of prologue at the beginning of the film chronicling the extent the German atrocities committed against the Russian population would have put things more in its proper context. While the rape of German women by the Russian soldiers was deplorable the film could have made the soldiers' motivations for doing so more understandable.'A Woman in Berlin' is a bit long and sometimes it's difficult to follow everything that's happening. All in all this is an admirable film depicting a little talked about period in history with verisimilitude and insight.".

While the rape of German women by the Russian soldiers was deplorable the film could have made the soldiers' motivations for doing so more understandable.'A Woman in Berlin' is a bit long and sometimes it's difficult to follow everything that's happening. All in all this is an admirable film depicting a little talked about period in history with verisimilitude and insight.";

	schema:reviewBody "A Woman in Berlin 2008Imagine the horrors of women caught in a large city during the chaos of war with occupying troops storming your apartment building day after day. Well think again. It isn't imaginable. I think even people who live through such things and we are talking Berlin 1945 for this movie the truth is something that is pushed away. Because even watching a moviea movie!of these events is unbearable.Not that the movie is unwatchable. Just the opposite. It's beautifully made seeming to parallel that other recent German movie about the last days of the Nazi reign Downfall 2004. But unlike that movie this isn't about political history or the history of war or even the dramatization of historical figures as real people. This is a personal story centering around one woman played by Nina Hoss and about the repeated rape and abuse of women by the Russian troops for days and weeks on end. There was no escape no power to complain to no justice anywhere anywhere not German or Russian or even American assuming they were any better a mile or two away.The movie is based on a book Anonyma by a woman whose identity is not revealed if it is even known this was her protection even after death. The movie suffers now and then from a sameness a steady pounding beginning to end. The parade of horrors is continuous even as relationships develop and the first wave of anarchistic occupiers shifts to more entrenched troops and some general partying. You do cling to some semblance of progression or of events to stand out from the others but it's mostly about horribleness. But maybe that's the way it should be. It was an endless nightmare on every level even if you they these women survive. In some ways the end of the war is more believably insane here than in Downfall even though they are in many ways comparable movies comparable moments. Such an array or gritty believable acting and sets you won't find often. And thankfully even the sentimental aspects are handled without swelling music and other cinematic tricks found too often this side of the Atlantic.One last point whatever you think of the Germans and WWII here is yet another kind of national acknowledgment and for many soulsearching. This is a German film. The Russians don't come off great for sure but the Germans are clearly at fault and are shown that way and shown as responsible for even greater crimes. There's no glossing over any of it. Watch this movie. It won't be fun but it'll be stirring and important.".

	schema:headline " Good war movie touching a delicate subject matter";
	schema:reviewBody "A well made German movie that touches with frankness a very delicate historical subject the mass rape of German women by Soviet soldiers during and after the Battle of Berlin. The movie which has a good historical reconstruction of the times is based on the memories of a woman who choose to publish the book anonymously. After her death it was revealed that she was a relatively well to do minor functionary in the Nazi propaganda ministry. She knew several languages including Russian and was well traveled. Her book was first published in the 1950s in Germany but its frank portrayal of the sexual relations between the Germans and the Russians shocked many at the time who felt it besmirched German women. Also I suppose some people were afraid the book could be accused of Nazi revisionism. As a result the book languished in obscurity for many decades afterward and it was only republished with great public success in 2003 well after the Cold war ended and the author died.According to the movie the Russians engaged in rape not because they were sadistic very few of them are portrayed this way but because they have a very natural urge for sex and they had few available Russian women around among the troops. In this the movie disagrees with the feminist adage that rape is not about sex but about power. The Russian soldiers were so starved of sex that they even rape older German women in their 60s or even 70s. As shown in this film German women at first were obviously shocked at being raped but later would more or less adapt to the situation and even joke about it and seek powerful Russians as lovers to protect themselves from mass rapes by drunken lowly soldiers. The protagonist here seeks as a lover a Russian commander that seems to be quite a decent fellow but who would eventually find there are problems in getting too near to her.I think that in general the movie is quite fair in its portrayal of the Russians troops. This doesn't mean that if the movie is ever shown in Russia I seriously doubt that the audience would feel very comfortable in the portrayal of their countrymen most of the Soviet soldiers appear here as loud brash vulgar many times drunk. But they are not portrayed as sadistic. Personally I don't think one can make a moral equivalence between the rape of German women which is obviously reprehensible and the genocidal behavior of the German army in the Eastern front during World War II killing millions of innocent Jews and Slavs the movie should have mentioned more about the latter I think. That objection aside this is a fine movie.".

Wiki The controversial German movie is about the women who survived the war by working as captivate prostitutes for the Russians. Just like every war all the men were killed and women were tortured and captured by the occupiers. The starting of the movie is really nice as how it shows how people have to go through and live through once Russians won over Germany. The women whose husbands were Nazi were bound to be raped and tortured by the occupiers. The performances by all the German actor and actresses and especially Nina Hoss August Diehl  Evgeniy Sidikhin are admirable. Because the performances in these hard hitting movies makes you believe the situation. The beginning of the movie really good but the movie falls when they start showing the romance between German woman and the Red Army commander it slowed down the phase.

Ignore the historical revisionist reviews in these pages. Here's a summary of what to expect in this movie.As a movie It's an interesting plot with characters that are only partially developed. What dominates is the settingBerlin in Spring of 1945. The intrigue of the movie is the setting the war the meeting of the different peoples Germans and Russians. It's worth watching for that.As history It does present a story that needs to be toldthe rape of the German women by the Russians. Rape is prevalent in war all nations were guilty of rape on the part of their men but what the Russians did to the German women is beyond compare. There are a lot of reasons for that but you won't discover those in the movie. You'll need to read the book for that.As a movie based on a book What a great disappointment. The richness of the book is the perspective given by this author her insights into war and people and her writing. Very nicely done. The movie on the other hand focuses only on the action. A very complex diary is distilled down to some very basic themes in the movie war is bad people do bad things in war love crosses boundaries. Spoiler Alert The keeper of this diary is portrayed as falling for her Russian friend. That is not the case in the book. She is simply trying to survive a situation the men of Germany and Russia placed her in. The true drama in the book revolves around the choices she must make to survive. Also the movie character addresses her diary to her fiance Gerd. Not so in the book. She is her own person and not the woman waiting for her man.Bottom line read the book but watch the movie if you can't read itjust keep in mind that this is not the real story.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a great film. It tells the story of the eponanonymous protagonist who both witnessed and endured the rape of Berlin in a very personal manner. And yet the film manages not to be too depressing until the very end thanks in no small part to the assured acting skills of Nina Hoss. She conveys an unbreakable spirit and intelligence despite having so little dialogue in the film. And yes she did make me wonder what would I do in her shoes. Having watched it I also feel strangely empowered about rape. Anonyma's story seems to validate that there is always more than one way to deal with a desperate situation.I am a tad shocked that the story of these women was silenced for so long but knowing what I do of the German people I suppose I shouldn't be surprised  stoicism plays a huge role in their public life. Yet apparently 10000 women died 'just' from being raped during this period of German history. It's a sobering statistic and one which makes a mockery of the assertion of the Russian commander who early on in the film implies that STIs are the greatest threat women face from his soldiers. Like rapists everywhere they seem blissfully oblivious to the physical and psychological costs of their abuses and are correctly portrayed in the film as phallically obsessed emotionally retarded cowards. It's important to remember that the average age of their victims was 16. The majority of these girls and young women were children at the start of the war and had no say in the actions of their government which was at any rate a misogynistic dictatorship. There has been a lot of discussion around what this film is saying about wartime rape. Were these women making concessions with the enemy or were they enduring a relentless onslaught of sexual violence in the best way that they could? The film explores both possibilities. It also makes it clear that there is not one answer for every woman in the film some of the victims lose their minds and end up killing themselves or others others find a sugardaddy in the Russian army who gives them 'gifts' in exchange for protection or at the very least less violent sex.Personally I see this film as a story about the way in which women cope with unimaginable unjustifiable violence from their other halves. The scene that sums up the madness of their situation is when the 'girls' get together for drinks and joke about being attacked by Russian soldiers. Beneath the smiles and laughter you can see hear and even FEEL that something is falling apart inside them. That they are on the verge of hysterics. I sincerely hope that viewers didn't wrongly interpret this scene to mean that women think rape is funny because to me it was very obvious that it had the opposite meaning. A cunning and subtle move on the part of the director who never underestimates his audience. I sincerely feel for the women who remained in Berlin during this time and so should every human being with a conscience. They didn't have choices they were trapped in an occupied city with no way out and very few habitable buildings. The only supply of food and necessities came through the very men who were raping them. The Allied nations were well aware of the situation and did not intervene for nearly a year because they felt that raping Germans boosted morale sorry to be so blunt but there was an actual quote to that effect from the American military. It's an all too familiar story and one that has been played out in war torn countries right up until this day Bosnia the Congo etc. So it boggles the mind that it's taken so long to make a film about the subject. I guess that just goes to show how maledominated the film industry really is!!In one scene Anonyma confronts a major and asks him to do something to stop the rape of Berlin women. He replies Who should I protect? My people or yours? My answer to that question would have been 'You should protect the women and the unarmed civilians whom you're fighting to free.' After all the whole point of overthrowing Hitler was to gain freedom for everyone or so the Allies said. In reality the fall of Berlin became a pitched battle in the war of men versus women. Eine Frau in Berlin paints a grim picture of what the world might look like if the men were triumphant.".

It also makes it clear that there is not one answer for every woman in the film some of the victims lose their minds and end up killing themselves or others others find a sugardaddy in the Russian army who gives them 'gifts' in exchange for protection or at the very least less violent sex.Personally I see this film as a story about the way in which women cope with unimaginable unjustifiable violence from their other halves. The scene that sums up the madness of their situation is when the 'girls' get together for drinks and joke about being attacked by Russian soldiers. Beneath the smiles and laughter you can see hear and even FEEL that something is falling apart inside them. That they are on the verge of hysterics. I sincerely hope that viewers didn't wrongly interpret this scene to mean that women think rape is funny because to me it was very obvious that it had the opposite meaning. A cunning and subtle move on the part of the director who never underestimates his audience. I sincerely feel for the women who remained in Berlin during this time and so should every human being with a conscience. They didn't have choices they were trapped in an occupied city with no way out and very few habitable buildings. The only supply of food and necessities came through the very men who were raping them. The Allied nations were well aware of the situation and did not intervene for nearly a year because they felt that raping Germans boosted morale sorry to be so blunt but there was an actual quote to that effect from the American military. It's an all too familiar story and one that has been played out in war torn countries right up until this day Bosnia the Congo etc. So it boggles the mind that it's taken so long to make a film about the subject. I guess that just goes to show how maledominated the film industry really is!!In one scene Anonyma confronts a major and asks him to do something to stop the rape of Berlin women. He replies Who should I protect? My people or yours? My answer to that question would have been 'You should protect the women and the unarmed civilians whom you're fighting to free.' After all the whole point of overthrowing Hitler was to gain freedom for everyone or so the Allies said. In reality the fall of Berlin became a pitched battle in the war of men versus women. Eine Frau in Berlin paints a grim picture of what the world might look like if the men were triumphant.";

	schema:reviewBody "I had already submitted a review of this movie earlier but as it may have seemed misleading for some people I thought I should rephrase it.First of all I'd like to congratulate to Glock22 for his review The Germans are pathetic 25 February 2011 who summarized the problematic parts within the movie very well. This movie comes 2nd on the self blame list of Germans the 1st one is Stalingrad in case you are wondering. The main problem with the movie is that it's actually a quasi love story  instead of a war drama  between a German woman and a Russian major. It's something that was quite unlikely to have happened if not impossible at all. So instead of the facts it shows us an example that probably never happened I know the movie is based on a diary but it sill doesn't make it authentic. At the beginning the movie focuses on the rape itself because that's what happened when the Soviet Army occupied a town or settlement  a gang rape that lasted for several days until they left the area. Then of course a new wave of soldiers came and the whole process started all over again. There were also lootings and murders which aren't really emphasized in the movie. The movie fails to mention that several thousands of women died during the rapes in horrendous ways their back broken beaten or tortured death and also children were involved amongst the victims  sometimes not above the age of 9. It wasn't a rare example when the mother and the daughter were raped at the same time by these soldiers.To me the scenes where German women are joking about how many soldiers had raped them seemed very unnatural morbid and improper. I can't really imagine anyone could be making fun about this. The scene where they celebrate and dance together with the Soviet soldiers provoked similar feelings. The reason why I found these unnatural is maybe because in Hungary  where the same things happened as in Germany and Austria  the women who were raped often committed suicide after they had been raped because of shame self blame and moral issues. In those years for a woman to sleep with a man who wasn't her husband meant terrible shame not to mention that rape could hardly be called sleeping. Sadly in Hungary there are people also who still call the Soviets liberators and never think of the hundreds of thousands of women who were raped humiliated and sometimes killed.What the movie shows well is when the Soviet officers show no concern when they hear about the rape cases. Usually they said it helped the soldiers to cool off to let out the steam. Now that's true. Question is who is going to give compensation to these people and to those who have been taken to Siberia to work in labour camps  if a woman was really unlucky she was robbed raped and then taken to a labour camp where she died? Seemingly everyone has forgotten about them.If you are looking for true facts historically accurate emotions and situations from the invaded Germany from the end of WW II then avoid this movie. Instead go and read a book about it from a Hungarian author Alaine Polcz  who had also experienced the liberation A Wartime Memoir Asszony a Fronton  in Hungarian. There's another movie that deals with the topic and is much more authentic therefore much more disturbing Joy Division 2006.Only if you do not care about true historical facts and would like to see an unlikely story taking place in Berlin at the end of WW II should you watch this movie.".

I was 20 years old and I lived with my mother and sister... I liked him but he never approached me. He followed me when I was sick with pneumonia. He laughed a lot which helped to free us from fear.

She joined to watch and disappeared about half an hour into the movie. Germans at the time thought of Russians as brutal subhumans and that was part of the justification for conquering  enslaving them so that the more deserving master race could take over their lands. Looks like some still have that attitude. My mother does not nor do most of her friends who also experienced the war from various parts of Berlin and Germany. Sure rapes did happen but not to the extent that this movie portrays where every day consisted endless Russian abuses. My mother was not raped once nor any of her friends. The Russian soldiers were human  some good some bad  no different than any other human beings. She tells the story of an extremely drunk Russian soldier invading the basement they were hiding in as their first contact. Yes he did drag a woman off into the corner no doubt a terrifying experience. But then before he could do any damage he fell asleep  started snoring.".

Germans at the time thought of Russians as brutal subhumans and that was part of the justification for conquering  enslaving them so that the more deserving master race could take over their lands. Looks like some still have that attitude. My mother does not nor do most of her friends who also experienced the war from various parts of Berlin and Germany. Sure rapes did happen but not to the extent that this movie portrays where every day consisted endless Russian abuses. My mother was not raped once nor any of her friends. The Russian soldiers were human  some good some bad  no different than any other human beings. She tells the story of an extremely drunk Russian soldier invading the basement they were hiding in as their first contact. Yes he did drag a woman off into the corner no doubt a terrifying experience. But then before he could do any damage he fell asleep  started snoring.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a fine film. There's nothing great about it but it recounts the story of Marta Hillers well. A victimized woman she wrote about her experiences and now these have been made into a film with an obvious German bend. The performances are fine though I wasn't convinced by the portrayal of Russians and even some Germans. The Germans like other Westerners just don't know what Russians are really like  how they talk behave or what they do. Like other war films this one shows how difficult war can be for an individual. And like other Western war films of recent years this one has been made to raise awareness of a subject most importantly an antiRussian subject. I'm not going to beat around the bush  this is in part a propaganda film. Not a very offensive one but it aims to show that Germans have suffered at the hands of the Russians. What's more disturbing is that Russophobes Neonazis Euro and Western propagandists use this antiRussian fare and add their lies about the Russians. These characters in the West are the result of more than half a century of offensive antiRussian propaganda. The fact that some German women were raped by some soldiers of the Red Army isn't a secret. The reason why it's being brought up now is for propaganda and psychological purposes. History is being rewritten in the West and the antiRussian project has been active for decades anyway. A great country is being portrayed as the lowest in history. I can't really do anything against the monstrous superbloc called the West but I can contribute the truth. I'm not an antiGerman but here are the facts if Nazi Germany and her several allies had won the war against the Soviet Union then Soviet people would have been enslaved and possibly exterminated by the Germans. The Russian nation would have been destroyed and the Nazis plus other Westerners would have been happy. However the Soviet Union won the war and thus Germany was divided by the allies. The war resulted in 9 million German deaths and after the Cold War ended Germany was reunified. Unfortunately the Soviet Union dissolved and bloodsucking America can now wage her endless wars with Germany as an ally. Thanks to some cunning economic support from Uncle Sam Germany is now one of the richest countries in the world. The Soviet Union also provided support for East Germany but this has been conveniently forgotten. Because of the West Russia's future seems grim so it seems that a part of what Adolf Hitler wanted has been achieved. I'm not sure about Germany's future but for now things aren't bad at all for her. As it stands this film is a fine telling of a somewhat nationalist woman but given the complexities of war and the fact that the Battle of Berlin is one of the bloodiest battles in history I find this film severely lacking in perspective.".

Film costs millions to make. BankersFinanciers are not going to finance films where they teach working class people their own history. Period. The film doesn't work on a historical level nor as an artistic cinematic endeavor.From the point of view of history Many family members  neighbors lived in Nazi Germany. This story is purely fictional. Were there any Russian soldiers who raped German women? Of course. American soldiers who raped German women? Of course. In fact some women are being raped as we speak whether on the streets of New York City Rome or China. The relevant question to ask was whether the Soviet government ever encouraged or legalized rape during WW2? The answer is Absolutely not! Let's look at the time period World War 2 was coming to an end and all of Eastern Europe went socialist. France Italy Germany and Greece were also going to go socialist. The Finance Bankers of the US and Great Britain wanted to stop this from happening. Thus the Marshall Plan was created. It was a battle between the East and West for the hearts and minds of not only the East Germans but the Central Europeans. If Russian soldiers were raping millions of East German women as this film falsely show why did East Germany become socialist and remain socialist for over 40 years? Why are East Germans particularly East German women protesting by the hundreds of thousands to restore socialism there? From the prospective of artistic endeavor Because a film may have been created as a piece of propaganda doesn't mean the production values need to be low are unwatchable. Regardless of how I feel about Nazi Germany many of their film productions like Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will were masterpieces of their time that still resonant to today's audience. Lousy direction abysmal acting horrible cinematography and poor script make this film unwatchable. The cinematography is shot in an almost gray pallor. Why? I don't know. Was the world black and white before 1960? The script and dialogue is silly and vulgar beyond belief. I'm ashamed and my German Protestant Family would have been even more ashamed. To give just one of several examples An old lady willingly raped repeatedly by Russian soldiers comments how Russian men love having sex with her because as she depicts with her hand her vagina is small like a pea unlike Ukrainian women who have vaginas the size of grapefruits. First why would any young soldier let alone many want to rape ugly old women old enough to be their grandmother? It's ridiculous! More over the overt racism against Ukrainian women is offensive and the dialogue just plain smut. Women didn't speak like this when I was a young woman in NYC in the 1990's and they for sure didn't speak this way in sexually repressed postwar Germany.One last thing before I end my review A relevant question to ask is why certain films are financed and not others? This was a film destined to flop at the box office so why would Bankers finance bombs ? Simple This was the period when Austerity began and workers throughout Europe were having their worker rights' destroyed pensions decimated and so on. The film's purpose is to make people doubt the possibility that a better alternative is possible so people continue to accept the tyranny of the RobberBaron Finance Capitalists 1. By demonizing the Soviet Union the 1 is trying to indoctrinate into the population that all alternatives are worse. 1 StarRotten. Pure trash if it would have been created to be trashy Europorn it would have been less trashy.".

The film presents in a riveting manner the moment when the Soviet forces entered Berlin in the final stage of World War II. The atrocities committed by the Soviets especially in the rape of women in Berlin are well chronicled. But this film places a face on the tragic developments as recounted by the anonymous diarist.The film graphically conveys the brutality inflicted on civilians especially the women as the Soviet army awaits the arrival of the allies of England and America from the west. The time seems endless as the Soviets are awaiting the unified effort to deliver the knockout punch to the Reichstag.Nina Hoss gives a complex and multilayered performance as the anonymous journalist and Eugeny Sidikhim is the dutybound yet vulnerable commanding officer Andrej Rybkin with whom Anonyma has an affair. The film is careful to demonstrate the Anonyma's choice to develop her relationship with Andrej was purely based on survival. She made a conscious decision to exercise the limited amount of free will in her grasp to at least choose her partner. The film gives a fascinating portrayal of how their relationship develops.The film may be excessive in its lengthy for such a a drama that is essentially focused on one main relationship. For a film that ran over two hours some of the secondary characters could have been developed more completely.It is shocking to contemplate there there was outrage in Germany when the diary was published in 1959. Incredibly Anonyma was seen as a collaborator with the Soviets at the height of the Cold War. It is a credit to director Max Frberbck did not let this important memoir die but brought in back to life in this moving and uncompromising film version. Bravo!".

And just like that one we also have mostly strong female characters in this movie here and there is again a World War II background. Unfortunately I personally did not feel as if there was anything really new here anything that has not been done already in this uncountable number of German films centered around the days of war.And my appreciation for lead actress Nina Hoss goes south pretty quickly too. While I initially enjoyed her the first couple times I saw her I must say by now she does not bring any new nuances to the characters she plays and it is almost always the exact same we see from her in terms of mannerisms and details. She may be good in picking characters that fit her but there is really nothing that makes a difference in her performances anymore really. It surprises me to see she is one of Germany's most famous in the United States at this point. There are more deserving actresses out there. The cast here features some more wellknown names such as Jrdis Triebel Juliane Khler August Diehl Sandra Hller and Sebastian Urzendowsky who I still cannot see an ounce of talent in.Finally I want to say that I do not recommend seeing this film. The rating here on IMDb is certainly way too high. It is not a bad film by any means and there are some fine scenes that stay memorable but it just isn't enough for a runtime over 130 minutes. And honestly I must say as hard as Frberbck tried eventually I did not really care for any of the characters or women in this film and how their fate evolved while events unfolded. Thumbs down. There are many superior German films about World War II. The music in here is nice but it's also not original so no credit to the makers from this movie other than for chossing it.".

I do have to agree with my son though that it's best to watch this movie with subtitles rather than dubbing. Dubbing cannot capture the same character qualities as the original and often very witty Japanese dialogue does.".

	schema:headline " The movie is much like the OVA";
	schema:reviewBody "This is quite an interesting show basically going along the lines of the OVA rather then the TV show. You know the one with the really scantily clad Naga the Serpent. Now though I really don't like Naga I do like the movies plot. This story has Lina heading to an elf town and defeating a demon. It would be no different then any other episode except this is when she is first introduced to the sword of light.Naga is a really stupid woman who couldn't even tell when someone is actually a bandit. Sometimes I think the only reason they brought her in is to make a reason for Lina to go the island where the story takes place. The bandits are extremely stupid and I have to say they didn't show any thought in creating them. All the teams seem to be families. Other enemies seem to do long winded explanations on what there diabolical plans are before they even fight Lina Of course I don't understand how everyone knows her on the island as well but that's another story. Other characters seem as though they were quickly put together and given stupid names.Sadly most of the show does have a rather 'filler' feeling about it. The ending was rather anticlimatic only about 10 minutes of the long movie so it feels bland in that aspect. I may have loved the journey but the finish line felt like it was lacking.The artwork shows its age rather nicely actually. It means that the show might look rather old but it to me it's almost a classic. The style while slightly rough has a lot of detail in the backgrounds and even in some characters that move around. The monsters are a little generic but extremely detailed in how they move and attack. They must have put a decent amount of money into this when it was made.The English voices are sometimes OK though a couple of the girls voices sound like they are straining there voice but it doesn't get to bad. Lina really sounds whinny Cynthia Martinez makes her sound like she is on the verge of losing her voice most of the time for how high pitched she is. Phil Ross on the other hand makes a great Rowdy and David Bell does do a really good of Young Rowdy making them seem like they really could have been the same voice. Again I wasn't keen on Naga's stupid laugh. I can give props to Kelly Manison for doing a pretty good job on the voice though for playing a rather annoying character to begin with anyway. The script though is sometimes cheesy and sometimes rather cleaver with the jokes. It made the show stand out in that fashion. I do have some problems with the dub in that once in a while they throw a curve ball into the mix like having the demon cry out Sylvester's saying from Looney Toons or some other parody. It may work in some extent for American watchers but for those that look for a closer dubbing this is not one. I'm also not into the change that they did to the signature spells that Lina has.It's sad whenever I have to review a show that I like and it falls short. Sadly I can't give this a 5 star rating but it is worth watching if you like a bit of comedy or the normal TV and OVA shows of slayers. Plus as said in the description this does actually link to Gourry Gabriev from the TV show so its kind of funny seeing the link.".

I would've been 13 at the time I recalled that trailer and song and found the whole film available on YouTube to watch. It was amazing  met my expectations! Beautiful main characters good humor exciting action welladded drama...The English dub was excellent as well. Cynthia Martinez really brings out Lina Inverse's fiestiness while I expected Naga to sound more seductive I appreciated the haughtiness to her voice brought by Kelly Manison. Upon my first viewing I was wondering if these characters given by their names were really meant to be European and also if Naga's laugh sounds like the original Japanese. It turned out I might as well be right!I also learned afterwards that this is based on an anime series. Thankfully you don't even need to watch it first in order to understand this. It's short sweet and stands as its own. And if it wasn't for The Motion Picture I wouldn't have checked out and fallen in love with the Slayers show.I went through a period of time when I was obsessed with the theme Midnight Blue by Megumi Hayashibara Lina's original voice actress. I'd listen to it endlessly much to the annoyance of my family!I love this movie so much I added it to my Christmas list in 2015 and got it on DVD in the mail.".

I had always meant to though since I'd learned from other fans that it was a great series. Last week I noticed this tape was available for rent at the video store. I eagerly picked it up........And was VERY disappointed. I thought that this movie was just plain awful. It was neither funny nor containing any shred of an interesting plot. On top of my list of problems with this movieI found the dialogue to be irritating though the humor found in the Slayers series might rely on campiness so I might have missed the pointthe characters annoying with personality traits that are barely interestinga rather dumb plot why exactly DO Lina and Naga team up anyway?. I will admit that the 'breast enlargement' subplot made me smirk as did the breastbouncing bit in the castle midway through the flick but a quest for a bigger bust does NOT make for a good movie when that's all that's going for itand the battle scenes almost put me to sleep. Lina and Naga just fire off spell after spell after spell  whoopee ding. There was no sense of challenge or suspensedanger of the protagonists losing the magic fights.Sorry to those who enjoyed this though I'll be darned if I can figure out how you did but this movie wasn't worth the free rental coupon I used to get it. 'Slayers The Motion Picture' wasn't as bad as the first 'Sorcerer Hunters' video or that loathsome 'Battle Arena Toshinden' movie but it wasn't too far behind in my book.I won't be giving up on the 'Slayers' series  maybe 'Next' or 'Try' or the originals will float my boat. But it'll be a cold day in hell before this turkey winds up in my anime collection.Try the Project AKo series instead.".

I enjoyed this movie very much because of the gritty realism Mr. Russell uses in this one. Theresa Russell is excellent as the whore who gives us an insider's view of the world of lowclass prostitution. It's no the glamorous life as most of the women who fall prey to the oldest profession. Women so desperate to make a living turn to an easy way of making quick cash. Many of them are strung out on drugs milked for every cent by their pimps or wind up in jail. Too bad this movie is all but forgotten. Whilst movies like Pretty Woman show us the bright side of prostitution Whore shows us it's true dark self.I found this movie to be very interesting. It took a lot of courage for Mr. Russell to make such an noncommercial film. If it were available on D.V.D. it would be a part of my collection. Maybe one day it'll get it's due. Followed by an unrelated sequel.Highly recommended.Check out Ken Russell's bit role as the high class waiter.".

The cartoonish satirical bent the film has in the face of its horrific situations is exactly what makes it so brilliant. What was so awful about Pretty Woman was the commodification of prostitution as something glamorous fulfilling and rewarding pablum to be swallowed by American masses. Whore's success depends less on the performances and direction and more on the viewer's willingness to think. The ideology that Ken Russell has placed on the material is unmistakable and renders everything else about the film meaningless. It really comes down to the viewerIf you are intelligent enough as a viewer to read the subtext you either agree with it or you don't. Personally I love everything about it from Teresa Russell's sarcastic bombastic careerwrecking performance to the simple joy of seeing Antonio Fargas on screen again Whore is a great intelligent film worth repeated viewings. The real tragedy is that this will be Ken Russell's last great film. He has lived long enough to see his wonderful style get railroaded into softcore porn and madeforcable scifi. The world would be a better place if he had been bestowed with the same luck as Paul Verhoeven.".

Come on people this is the real deal here and these are a lot of the realities of prostitution. It isn't pretty is it? How much value is attached to the life of a prostitute? Ask the King County sheriff's Department and the Seattle Police they allowed the Green River killer to runriot for 20 years.I consider this a pretty pure film for Ken Russell and a pretty compassionate statement FOR the victims of prostitution. Legalization is wisely advocated and we even get a few of the arguments from the pimp himself what some of the drawbacks would be. Prostitution is illegal for means of social control period. Watch this film and you will understand that Mr. Russell is a GENUINE Christian with a heartafter all Jesus consorted with such people didn't he? They need our help and our compassion which is the maintheme of the film.Of course Ken Russell also enjoys the inherent bawdiness of the materialathand or he wouldn't be Ken Russell! The dialog is a dream and David Mamet's playsscreenplays would be a good analogy. It's also clear that a lot of the dialog came from real prostitutes and their stories. While some have commented on the lowbudget look of the film I don't think that this is accurate. It looks pretty slick cinematographywise and the acting by Theresa Russell norelation to the writerdirector is astonishing. She is easily one of the greatest actresses of her generation. She's also incredibly powerful in projecting her sexuality as an actor which is pretty rare.Only Kathleen Turner stands as her equal.So if you enjoyed Crimes of Passion nearly as much as I did a masterpiece this will be a wonderful companionfilm for you dear viewers. You either love or hate Ken Russell and he has always been my favorite form of a highstress personality endurancetest. Most tend to fail this test but it takes allkinds doesn't it? Once it hits DVD it will finally be able to be fullyassessed. That it shines so brightly on my unratedVHScopy is testament to its brilliance and the genius of Ken Russell. A message to be heeded on the world's oldestprofession. Puritans takeheed. It shouldn't be a problem to say it. Give this man money to make another film!".

It sounds silly but I notice these things when watching films. That was the most unauthentic part of this film noticing how perfect she looked.From viewing documentaries depicting real life prostitutes HBO's series about hookers in the Bronx those women were rough....missing teeth barely literate etc and other movies depicting the horrors of prostitution we all know they usually don't look as good as Ms. Russell does in this film....unless they are call girls. Call girls aren't as abused as street hookers they usually have a decent and comfortable place to be with their clients.Most street whores have drug problems even if they don't that rough 'street life' certainly takes a toll on ones looks. I saw none of that in Theresa's character. She looked young and vibrant! Nevertheless she gave a great performance given the below par script she was given to work with. I also enjoyed the 'Alfie' speakingintothecamera style and the antiPretty Woman message. Anyone who thinks prostitution is in any way 'glamourous' well they need to read a bit more about the seedy demeaning aspects of that life. Then go back to school to get a decent education so they can get a normal job. There are no free rides pardon the pun in that world.Good performances all around. Though it would have been nice to see Antonio Vargas play a different character other than a wacky street person at least he wasn't a pimp!".

It's not for everyone but I found it to be a good character study with humor sex and all the other elements of fun sleaze that make a Ken Russell film so much raunchy fun.  I like the character of Rasta and I haven't liked Ms. Russell in another movie before or since.  Porn star Ginger Lynn Allen does a cameo as does cult actor Jack Nance.  Go see 'Whore'.  Even if you can't say it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Russell's often cited perfect retort to Pretty Woman deals with a Los Angeles streetwalker and her myriad of seedy misadventures as a woman of the night...and day. Based from a stage play it pretty much works like that but basically set outdoors. Russell Theresa that is directs monologues at the camera in between interaction with various figures in her life. Be it her Brooks Brothers pimp who looks more like a yuppie banker or a pair of dopey foreigners she comingles with. Odd that Russell the director would choose not one but two men of faraway descent for the female Russell to play off of. The first being what seems to be a Jamaican though played by AfricanAmerican actor Fargas for midnight chats and a clichd Arab who says cutesy things like Will you be doing it without a rubber thing?. Russell's story darts about in different fashions from flashbacks to inthemoment pickups from customers. At one point director Russell even cuts to the pimp cruising the streets and waxing philosophical to the camera as well. Those expecting something gratuitous to munch popcorn to need to look elsewhere. Whoring is not glamorized here with gang rapes slashed hookers and hateful tricks full of salty language. Once in a while director Russell lightens things up with throwaway gags no pun including a comical caning and a shoefetish nutbar who even comes with a small script. Physically Russell is an effective choice for Liz perhaps a little too pretty but does sport a big butt and a few extra pounds. What distracts more is Russell's exceedingly uneven performance one of the more mixed I've ever seen. Crossing an Elvira voice with a jr. high intellect she captures your attention though not always winningly. Part of the problem is the alltooapparent dubbing of her voice for the street scenes. In order to remove the horns and whooshing of cars her rereading of lines is sometimes painful to listen to. Her quieter moments of preprostitution life work better she being portrayed more as innocent and naive. Along with those scenes being shot indoors. The film sometimes lapses into inappropriate satire or bawdiness then will slug you with broken fingers and slashed throats. It doesn't always work but holds your attention. Sort of a reworking of Russell's far superior 1984 work Crimes of Passion with the same wiseassed hooker approach. Though that film was more straightforward and a had a threecharacter triangle of obsession marital commentary and redemption. Here the femme Russell is pretty much by herself leading a more onenote lifestyle. Seek out Crimes for the better movie seek out Whore for a gritty reality check.".

Rasta Antonio Fargas pops up from time to time to inexplicably help her.This was made in response to Pretty Woman which actually made prostitution look glamorous. Director Ken Russell had trouble getting funding for thisno actress would take the role and the title alone scared away investors. Finally Theresa Russell no relation agreed to do it but he still had trouble getting funds. The movie was cheaply made and it shows in some of the sets. It also prevents Russell from any overindulgences which are usually the highlights of his films. It comes off cinematically kind of muted.The acting carries this. Theresa is a great actressshe pulls off the role showing the humor and pain in equal doses. Also she has quite a few long monologues which she pulls off without a hitch. Mouton is also good as her slimy pimp and it's always good to see Fargas in anything although his character makes no sense.The screenplay is greatit doesn't shy away from any of the realities of prostitution and is quite graphic. Nothing is really shown but the descriptions and sounds make it quite clear what's going on. It does fall apart at the end leaving a conclusion that was totally unbelievable. Some posters have complained that Russell is too glamorous to be a prostitute. That's truebut who wants to watch a movie with a real prostitute who aren't exactly attractive and are in terrible shape? Also there are a few cute references to earlier Russell films hereone movie theatre is playing Lair of the White Worm and another is playing a porno film starring China Blue the character Kathleen Turner played in his Crimes of Passion.I saw this originally in 1991 in a theatre in it's NC17 version. The one I saw on cable was R rated and dreadfully edited. The cuts are obvious and in one stupid moment a word is bleeped out ????. It still works as an R rated but try to find the uncut version. Good movie but the low budget hurts.".

Even the name of the film  WHORE disappears into the hole the large capitals becoming ever  diminished as they disappear into the tunnel!  The monologue addressing the camera stuff is presumably straight  from Alfie a film that Loach is probably quite familiar with.

The monologue addressing the camera stuff is presumably straight  from Alfie a film that Loach is probably quite familiar with. Perhaps  the whole film is a woman's revenge on the misogynous Alfie Michael  Caine!  Good viewing.";

	schema:reviewBody "Good old Ken Russell  The glorious days of Savage Messiah and The Devils were obviously long gone in the early 90's but still he was always up for directing a controversial and provocative motion picture. I read in several articles and interviews that Whore was primarily intended as a harsh and confronting response to the Julia Roberts comedy Pretty Woman which depicts prostitution as a carefree and happy happy joy joy profession. Of course everybody already knows that the job of a prostitute includes more than just sleeping with Richard Gere but Russell nonetheless insisted on dedicating a full movie based on this reality lesson. Whore is one part gripping docudrama and one part clichd venting but the overall impression it leaves is a positive and lasting one. Theresa Russell is excellent as Liz and since she speaks most of her monologues straight into a camera the viewer becomes irreversibly involved in her daily routines of abuse humiliation danger fear indescribably odd fetishes and general bullying. Whilst on the constant lookout for her relentless pimp Liz lectures about what she does and doesn't tolerate from customers tells lovely anecdotes about her wackiest clients like an elderly man who only gets off when she hits him with his own cane! and openly mentions the rookie mistakes that gradually turned her into the nihilistic and cynic woman she is now. Multiple sequences are unfortunately dreadful clichs like a failed marriage and the cute son Liz was forced to abandon or just plain weird the reoccurring meetings with the semispiritual Rasta guy. Strangely enough  but perhaps typical for Ken Russell  our director interlards the most involving moments of sincere human tenderness with revolting footage of the pimp also facing the camera and proudly talking about his spirit of enterprise and generally discriminating opinion on women. Whore tends to get a bit monotonous and repetitive but thankfully it's not too long and occasionally it too obviously shows the script is adapted from a stage play. And perhaps the biggest problem of the film might be that the subject matter actually TOO realistic to be a genuine Russell success formula. Those who're familiar with the man's repertoire know that he's at his absolute finest when adding grotesquely surreal plot material and visually imaginative gimmicks to a rudimentary concept. The everyday life of a prostitute simply doesn't lend itself to a lot of creative and artsy expanding and for Russell this is definitely a shortcoming. Notwithstanding the brutal approach and rather repellent promotional elements the blunt title the tagline This is no bedtime story Whore is a unique and compelling drama worth tracking down.".

Theresa Russell portrays Liz as bluntly honest nononsense about her job and what comes with the territory of being a hooker. She seems a bit uneducated and a tad obnoxious but at the same time you can't take your eyes of her because you never know what is about to come spewing out. Antonio Fargas portrays Rasta a street denizen for whom becomes someone for Liz to lean on and eventually her protector as it seems Blake could kill her at any time. We see in one of several past vignettes explained to the camerausa device director uses to optimum effect..this will either be a charm or annoyance to the viewerby Liz what violence can happen when an employee of his gets out of hand..a hooker gets her stomach slit open and nearly bleeds to death. We also see that even having a friend to chat with seems forbidden as Liz has a forming relationship with a bisexual named KatieLiz Moreheadfor whose life is threatened by Blake. Blake is such a mean coldblooded bastard he threatens to hook Liz's son when he comes of age.The film is set up as a means for a hooker to speak candidly about what it's like being a whore. We see Liz working those who stop off to check her out and even see one or two possible clients getting a chance at a good time. One client gets so worked up his heart stops! The film doesn't seem to judge Liz but the profession and it's disadvantages. Be warnedthe film is sexually explicit and profane from the moment we're introduced to Liz until the fadeout. I think either you will find Russell's performance grating and terrible or very watchable. I think Theresa is terrific capturing a character who really fell off the side of the tracks and is trying to confront what her choice of profession has done to herloss of her child to adoption the joyless task of getting men off etc. I will agree with many that Ken Russell's film is a mixed bag often drifting from comedy into tragedy but I myself just don't see how a woman like this' story could be told any other way.".

Antonio Fargas portrays Rasta a street denizen for whom becomes someone for Liz to lean on and eventually her protector as it seems Blake could kill her at any time. We see in one of several past vignettes explained to the camerausa device director uses to optimum effect..this will either be a charm or annoyance to the viewerby Liz what violence can happen when an employee of his gets out of hand..a hooker gets her stomach slit open and nearly bleeds to death. We also see that even having a friend to chat with seems forbidden as Liz has a forming relationship with a bisexual named KatieLiz Moreheadfor whose life is threatened by Blake. Blake is such a mean coldblooded bastard he threatens to hook Liz's son when he comes of age.The film is set up as a means for a hooker to speak candidly about what it's like being a whore. We see Liz working those who stop off to check her out and even see one or two possible clients getting a chance at a good time. One client gets so worked up his heart stops! The film doesn't seem to judge Liz but the profession and it's disadvantages. Be warnedthe film is sexually explicit and profane from the moment we're introduced to Liz until the fadeout. I think either you will find Russell's performance grating and terrible or very watchable. I think Theresa is terrific capturing a character who really fell off the side of the tracks and is trying to confront what her choice of profession has done to herloss of her child to adoption the joyless task of getting men off etc. I will agree with many that Ken Russell's film is a mixed bag often drifting from comedy into tragedy but I myself just don't see how a woman like this' story could be told any other way.";

Those who question the school's code become outcasts such as Bennet and Judd unless they are 'useful' in some way  ie when Judd is needed to prevent an unpopular boy becoming head of house.One important fact I noticed is that you hardly ever see a master in the school and you never see the boys in lessons this shows Eton not as merely a school but as a microcosm of society with its own specific hierarchy.There is interesting character development Bennett initially a philanderer who takes nothing seriously eventually realises that he is a confirmed homosexual and begins to understand Judd's vision of a perfect society possible through communism 'not heaven on earth but earth on earth  a just earth'Similarly Judd realises that sometimes it is necessary to sacrifice one's principles for the greater good.There is a lot about this film that is hackneyed  the bullying sadistic prefects the angelic boys with floppy fringes singing chapel anthems the stock rebellious phrases etc and I won't even mention Guy Bennet's ludicrous oldman makeupbut overall it is a beautiful piece of cinematography with some good acting from the young Mr Everett and Mr Firth.".

	schema:headline " Ambition vs. Principles  which would you choose?";
	schema:reviewBody "Forget the premise that homosexuality was the reason Burgess became a spy... a dubious conclusion. This movie is about ambition and how far one is willing to sacrifice one's principles to achieve it. The premise is explicitly stated in the opening frames with the voiceover from the aged Guy Bennett fictionalized Burgess You've no idea what life in England in the 1930s was like. Treason and loyalty... they're all relative you know. Treason to what? Loyalty to whom? That's what matters.It is the 1930s in a famous public school in England. Rupert Everett is the star turn as homosexual Guy Bennett who longs to become a God head boy as a senior Colin Firth plays the supporting role of his best friend Tommy Judd a devout Communist. It was the first film for each actor and they're both terrific right out of the box. While Guy RE is selfconsciously theatrical he refers grandly to a tumescent archway the dialogue between the two roommates is simple and real. In one scene Guy puts a quick move on Tommy CF. He comes up behind Tommy puts one hand over his eyes to pull his head back and with the other rapidly starts unbuttoning Tommy's pajama shirt.G Alone at last! T boredamused Get OFF. G I'll get you one day. T No you won't. G Yes I will. Everyone gives in in the end. It's Bennett's Law. T I won't give in. G Well you're not normal. later G The reason everyone gives in in the end is they get lonely doing it on their own. They long for company. T Well I don't. Not your sort anyway. G insisting That's why my mother is marrying this awful Colonel person. T It couldn't just possibly be that she loves him? G Out of the question. He's got one of those awful little mustaches. Ghastly. Almost as much of a loather as my father was. T amused You mean even you would draw the line? G Don't be revolting. He's a grownup. T Of course. And it's all just a passing phase. G Exactly. Just like you being a Communist. T sarcastic Ha ha. G pause Judd T Hmm? G You and your usherette  T What about her? G Is it really so different? T From what? G BOYS. T Well how would I know? I've only ever had a girl.The whole scene takes place as the boys are changing the linens on their bunks going down to the laundry room folding sheets getting new ones. It's a great understated scene. Tommy Judd is calmly not threatened by Guy's flamboyance and homosexuality. What resonates throughout the movie is the feeling of genuineness and honesty between these two in a cavernous school where everything is about power leverage and bullying.The struggles in the movie concern ambition vs. principles. Guy is determined to be a God. Will Tommy sacrifice his principles for his friend's ambition? Will he sacrifice them simply for his friend? Meanwhile will Guy sacrifice his boyfriend for his own ambition?T I can't do it. I just cannot be a prefect. G Why not? T I do have my reputation you know. G snorts Your what? T I'm a school joke I quite realize that. But I am don't you think a respected joke? I do at least stick to my principles. People appreciate that. I abandon them now and he winds himself up into a passionate speech about how people will think he's a fake Communists are fake and Stalin's a fake! He's almost in tears  and then the head boy comes and he has to dive under a table he and Guy are out of bed after hours! Finally G speaking of the head boy My God that man is really cracking up. T Liberals always do under pressure. G You know you're a really hard man Tommy. T I've no time for him. He just wants a nice easy life and a nice easy conscience. And he's got no right to either.There are a lot more great exchanges. G sarcastically about Communism Heaven on Earth? T calmly Earth on earth. A just earth.The friendship between Guy Bennett and Tommy Judd seems far more touching and real  far more the heart of the movie  than the sketchedin affair between Guy and James Harcourt the character played by Cary Elwes.The whole production is filled with dewy beautiful boys starting with Everett who at 24 is painfully gorgeous with his big eyes and ripe petulant mouth. Firth at 23 has the sweetness of youth but otherwise is allowed to appear rather skinny and plain. No eyebrows hair standing on end and 1930s round spectacles. But his eyes glow with intensity and commitment. You totally believe his passion. Very tough to believe it was his first time in front of a camera.The movie itself is far from perfect. Some might think it slow and rather precious. But the messages about ambition and loyalty are timeless and the EverettFirth scenes are wonderful.".

	onyx:emotionText "Forget the premise that homosexuality was the reason Burgess became a spy... a dubious conclusion. This movie is about ambition and how far one is willing to sacrifice one's principles to achieve it. The premise is explicitly stated in the opening frames with the voiceover from the aged Guy Bennett fictionalized Burgess You've no idea what life in England in the 1930s was like. Treason and loyalty... they're all relative you know. Treason to what? Loyalty to whom? That's what matters.It is the 1930s in a famous public school in England. Rupert Everett is the star turn as homosexual Guy Bennett who longs to become a God head boy as a senior Colin Firth plays the supporting role of his best friend Tommy Judd a devout Communist. It was the first film for each actor and they're both terrific right out of the box. While Guy RE is selfconsciously theatrical he refers grandly to a tumescent archway the dialogue between the two roommates is simple and real. In one scene Guy puts a quick move on Tommy CF. He comes up behind Tommy puts one hand over his eyes to pull his head back and with the other rapidly starts unbuttoning Tommy's pajama shirt.G Alone at last! T boredamused Get OFF. G I'll get you one day. T No you won't. G Yes I will. Everyone gives in in the end. It's Bennett's Law. T I won't give in. G Well you're not normal. later G The reason everyone gives in in the end is they get lonely doing it on their own. They long for company. T Well I don't. Not your sort anyway. G insisting That's why my mother is marrying this awful Colonel person. T It couldn't just possibly be that she loves him? G Out of the question. He's got one of those awful little mustaches. Ghastly. Almost as much of a loather as my father was. T amused You mean even you would draw the line? G Don't be revolting. He's a grownup. T Of course. And it's all just a passing phase. G Exactly. Just like you being a Communist. T sarcastic Ha ha. G pause Judd T Hmm? G You and your usherette  T What about her? G Is it really so different? T From what? G BOYS. T Well how would I know? I've only ever had a girl.The whole scene takes place as the boys are changing the linens on their bunks going down to the laundry room folding sheets getting new ones. It's a great understated scene. Tommy Judd is calmly not threatened by Guy's flamboyance and homosexuality. What resonates throughout the movie is the feeling of genuineness and honesty between these two in a cavernous school where everything is about power leverage and bullying.The struggles in the movie concern ambition vs. principles. Guy is determined to be a God. Will Tommy sacrifice his principles for his friend's ambition? Will he sacrifice them simply for his friend? Meanwhile will Guy sacrifice his boyfriend for his own ambition?T I can't do it. I just cannot be a prefect. G Why not? T I do have my reputation you know. G snorts Your what? T I'm a school joke I quite realize that. But I am don't you think a respected joke? I do at least stick to my principles. People appreciate that. I abandon them now and he winds himself up into a passionate speech about how people will think he's a fake Communists are fake and Stalin's a fake! He's almost in tears  and then the head boy comes and he has to dive under a table he and Guy are out of bed after hours! Finally G speaking of the head boy My God that man is really cracking up. T Liberals always do under pressure. G You know you're a really hard man Tommy. T I've no time for him. He just wants a nice easy life and a nice easy conscience. And he's got no right to either.There are a lot more great exchanges. G sarcastically about Communism Heaven on Earth? T calmly Earth on earth. A just earth.The friendship between Guy Bennett and Tommy Judd seems far more touching and real  far more the heart of the movie  than the sketchedin affair between Guy and James Harcourt the character played by Cary Elwes.The whole production is filled with dewy beautiful boys starting with Everett who at 24 is painfully gorgeous with his big eyes and ripe petulant mouth. Firth at 23 has the sweetness of youth but otherwise is allowed to appear rather skinny and plain. No eyebrows hair standing on end and 1930s round spectacles. But his eyes glow with intensity and commitment. You totally believe his passion. Very tough to believe it was his first time in front of a camera.The movie itself is far from perfect. Some might think it slow and rather precious. But the messages about ambition and loyalty are timeless and the EverettFirth scenes are wonderful.";

	schema:headline " Transferred Nationalism";
	schema:reviewBody "Although the closing titles contain the standard all characters are fictitious disclaimer the scriptwriter Julian Mitchell has never denied that his main character Guy Bennett is a thinlydisguised portrait of Guy Burgess one of the notorious Cambridge spy ring who acted for Soviet Russia. The film is mostly set in an English public school during the 1930s based on Eton where Burgess was educated. What shocked British society most about the spy ring was not so much the treachery of its members as the fact that most of them were from welloff Establishment families and educated at the country's most prestigious schools.At the heart of the film is the friendship between Bennett and another student Tommy Judd. Although they are very different in personality they are drawn to one another because both in their own way are rebels against the system. Judd a committed Marxist is a rebel with a cause who despises the school and all it stands for. Bennett is a rebel without a cause whose attitudes are rather contradictory. He can see the absurdity and hypocrisy of the public school system and of the Establishment in general but still wants to benefit from that system. His greatest ambition is to become a god school slang for a senior prefect regarded as the school's social elite. Much of the plot revolves around the machinations of various senior pupils to achieve this coveted distinction Judd is virtually alone in disdaining it. At this stage Bennett is not actually a Communist when Judd quotes Lenin's attack on Karl Kautsky spouting a lot of Marxist jargon in the process Bennett replies Oh that's bad! but in a sarcastic tone of voice which implies that he neither knows nor cares what Judd is talking about.Bennett is also trying to come to terms with his homosexuality. He is engaged in a sexual relationship with another boy James Harcourt and there are indications that he has engaged in similar behaviour with others. The school's attitude to homosexuality in fact is fairly schizophrenic. Bennett and Harcourt are by no means the only pupils involved in gay relationships indeed another boy in Bennett's house has recently committed suicide after being caught in flagrante with his lover by a teacher. The greatest concern however of the staff and most of the prefects is the need to avoid scandal gay relationships are quietly tolerated provided they are kept discreet. When one prefect Fowler attempts to crack down on homosexuality motivated by Puritanical religious zeal he makes himself very unpopular with his fellows who fear that he might uncover things best left hidden. Bennett represents a challenge to this system of organised hypocrisy not because he is gay but because he is temperamentally incapable of discretion. The greatest sin is to get caught because that would force the authorities to take action they would prefer to avoid.If scandal does leak out the authorities prefer to insist that the boys were merely experimenting or going through a youthful phase. Even the otherwise nonconformist Judd takes this line. Unlike some of his colleagues he is firmly heterosexual and regards homosexuality with bemused incomprehension.

The film's implication in fact is that BennettBurgess spied for the Russians not because he was a convinced Communist but as an act of revenge against the British Establishment for rejecting him on account of his sexual orientation.

In 1984 controversy over the spy ring was still raging. Leftists who might under other circumstances have been sympathetic to Communism savagely attacked the spies as prize examples of upperclass treachery and corruption whereas some rightists most notoriously Peregrine Worsthorne attempted to defend them on the grounds that loyalty to one's beliefs could be more important than loyalty to one's country.Since the end of the Cold Way we no longer care as much about the Cambridge Spies as we once did which may explain why Another Country can seem unfashionable these days. It is however a very good film distinguished by an excellent performance from a young Colin Firth as Judd surprisingly likable despite his extremist views and an even better one from Rupert Everett as the floppyhaired nonchalantly rebellious yet secretly vulnerable Bennett. It also has a lot to say about matters of perennial importance loyalty to country loyalty to friends political idealism and the rights of sexual minorities. An intriguing and thoughtprovoking film. 810".

	onyx:emotionText "Although the closing titles contain the standard all characters are fictitious disclaimer the scriptwriter Julian Mitchell has never denied that his main character Guy Bennett is a thinlydisguised portrait of Guy Burgess one of the notorious Cambridge spy ring who acted for Soviet Russia. The film is mostly set in an English public school during the 1930s based on Eton where Burgess was educated. What shocked British society most about the spy ring was not so much the treachery of its members as the fact that most of them were from welloff Establishment families and educated at the country's most prestigious schools.At the heart of the film is the friendship between Bennett and another student Tommy Judd. Although they are very different in personality they are drawn to one another because both in their own way are rebels against the system. Judd a committed Marxist is a rebel with a cause who despises the school and all it stands for. Bennett is a rebel without a cause whose attitudes are rather contradictory. He can see the absurdity and hypocrisy of the public school system and of the Establishment in general but still wants to benefit from that system. His greatest ambition is to become a god school slang for a senior prefect regarded as the school's social elite. Much of the plot revolves around the machinations of various senior pupils to achieve this coveted distinction Judd is virtually alone in disdaining it. At this stage Bennett is not actually a Communist when Judd quotes Lenin's attack on Karl Kautsky spouting a lot of Marxist jargon in the process Bennett replies Oh that's bad! but in a sarcastic tone of voice which implies that he neither knows nor cares what Judd is talking about.Bennett is also trying to come to terms with his homosexuality. He is engaged in a sexual relationship with another boy James Harcourt and there are indications that he has engaged in similar behaviour with others. The school's attitude to homosexuality in fact is fairly schizophrenic. Bennett and Harcourt are by no means the only pupils involved in gay relationships indeed another boy in Bennett's house has recently committed suicide after being caught in flagrante with his lover by a teacher. The greatest concern however of the staff and most of the prefects is the need to avoid scandal gay relationships are quietly tolerated provided they are kept discreet. When one prefect Fowler attempts to crack down on homosexuality motivated by Puritanical religious zeal he makes himself very unpopular with his fellows who fear that he might uncover things best left hidden. Bennett represents a challenge to this system of organised hypocrisy not because he is gay but because he is temperamentally incapable of discretion. The greatest sin is to get caught because that would force the authorities to take action they would prefer to avoid.If scandal does leak out the authorities prefer to insist that the boys were merely experimenting or going through a youthful phase. Even the otherwise nonconformist Judd takes this line. Unlike some of his colleagues he is firmly heterosexual and regards homosexuality with bemused incomprehension. Bennett however realises that being gay is an inescapable part of who he is not a mere passing fad and that he will never love women. The film's implication in fact is that BennettBurgess spied for the Russians not because he was a convinced Communist but as an act of revenge against the British Establishment for rejecting him on account of his sexual orientation. He never asked himself whether his sexuality would be any more acceptable to the Soviet Establishment than it was to the British one.

This is a highly moving expose of the supposed teenage school days of infamous spy Guy Burgess is rich deep and luxurious. It is aesthetically pleasing with authentic although slightly mixed locations and the moody atmospherics employed heighten the enjoyment factor no end. The running undercurrents of class breeding expectation and tradition are the key features of this moving and entertaining story showing the underbelly of a traditionally British educational establishment.Rupert Everett stars as both an old Guy Bennett in a small apartment in snowy cold Moscow recounting his school days to a young female writer as well as the fresh faced young man he was in 1931. His performance bristles with the authenticity of class and ability. He is perfect as the too clever by half and defiantly too clever for his own good schoolboy Guy heading toward his last year of school hoping to receive the adulation and power of school god. Such dizzy heights seem well within his grasp after all this is what his entire school days have been building up to plus it's the level his ancestry achieved in generations gone by. His best friend is the broodingly attractive Marx reading communist loving Tommy Judd played with skill and passion by the young Colin Firth already demonstrating the skills that have taken him to the very top of the British acting profession. Guy and Tommy are friends mainly because they are on the outside of the establishment in that they simply don't follow the accepted norms of behaviour. Guy simply for his open homosexuality and Judd for his communist Marxist leanings and beliefs. Their friendship is one of surprising depths based on mutual respect and affection a respect that would later have farreaching implications. The public school setting of the 1930's could really be anywhere in the United Kingdom and at any decade of the last one hundred and fifty years or so such is the timeless charm of tradition still played out in many schools up and down the country to this day. A master on his way somewhere hears a noise and stumbled upon Martineau an endearingly cute blonde haired lad and a boy from another house engaged on a sexual act in one of the school changing rooms. It is a mutual act which we are lead to believe is commonplace in the darker places of a school of this type and time and is usually ignored a blind eye turned to it. However there are no blind eyes when it comes to the masters and Martineau faces expulsion for the most scandalous of reasons a fate he just cannot allow to endure. Thus the poor troubled boy takes his own life in the school chapel.Master and pupils alike are aghast at this course of action and they must pull together to prevent a scandal striking at the school for all their sakes they pull ranks and tighten the positions and time to rule with a rod of steel. What follows is essentially a powerbased annihilation of homosexuality that may or may not be prevalent in each house of the school. Bennett who is rather more open than most about his preference is subject to increased scrutiny and investigation. The unspoken message seems to be that no gay boy will be allowed as a school god it is a simple as that. No commies and no queers.....

Though the movie moves very slowly and has little action I still enjoyed the ambiance and the gorgeous scenery in and around Oxford. Everett and Firth are amazingly young and give excellent performances. It is interesting to note a youthful Earl Spencer playing one of the students good job! and some filming was even done at Althorp the Spencer home.On the downside the story fails to fully explain why Guy became a Russian spy and his old man hair and makeup are truly ridiculous but I still recommend the movie as an enjoyable look at traditional school life.".

	schema:reviewBody "When 'Another Country' first appeared in the '80s I watched it over and over loving the settings and the acting. Now 20 years on I have just acquired the DVD and have had to alter my original enthusiasm to a milder level of enjoyment... and an added irritation and impatience with the subject matter.What set my teeth against this film most recently was listening to the adolescent and emptyheaded commentary by Rupert Everett as interviewed in one of the special features on the DVD release. Looking at his feet as he speaks he drawls out something to the effect that life in England in the 30s was horrible. Really? I thought. I suppose life anywhere at anytime is always horrible for someone but most people seem to rub along quite nicely thank you very much. That train of thought got me onto the nature of rebels and causes and so on. Yes for homosexuals England was a harsh place to be with its brutal laws against such private behavior something that is always a danger when huge governmental systems get lawcrazy. But most homosexual men managed to have a good time and hold down decent careers a conclusion reached as a result of reading a great deal of historical biography from English men and women of the 20th century both gay and straight. Of course those people who managed to work within the system at the time would nowadays be dismissed as copouts by those in the gay community who willfully get in peoples' faces about their personal sexual preference. But not all gay people feel the need to air their personal behavior in public. But to return to the film I concluded that Guy Bennett Everett was simply a spoiled overindulged prat that's English for brat who would not curb his footinmouth problem with discretion and wisely keep his personal sexual preferences to himself as did most other people in that situation at the time.The English public school system was indeed a tough experience as I gather and prone to a militaristic and dutiful code of behavior that we today would find totally unacceptable for better or worse... that is arguable. But people at that time at least in the ruling classes felt it their duty to put country ahead of themselves and knuckled under to the system. We don't understand that now being a more selfindulgent and immature society.'Another Country' is the story of rebels without a cause or at least rebels with a questionable cause based on questionable motivations. That is where I have lost patience with this once highly revered film. It is still beautiful to watch however. The cinematography is superb as is the music and the acting. As a period piece showing the inner workings of a place like Eton College it is fascinating. The script such as it is is excellent. The most involving aspect of the story is the relationship between Guy and James Harcourt Cary Elwes who become lovers though this part of the whole story is touched on lightly and never becomes salacious or overegged as gay themed films are now.I still like this film well enough but it has not come down the twenty years since its creation with much grace or dignity. Colin Firth's character Tommy Judd was always tiresome with his endless communist tirades and pontificating but over time ironically his performance holds up the best. Other facets of his character once past his worship of Stalin and Lenin such as his un swerving adherence to an idealistic vision have come into focus more clearly and keeps the film from becoming just a mushy love story tagging around behind the flimsy excuse for Guy Bennett's treason against the country that gave him everything he had. Still worth a looksee but not the masterpiece I once thought it was.".

	onyx:emotionText "When 'Another Country' first appeared in the '80s I watched it over and over loving the settings and the acting. Now 20 years on I have just acquired the DVD and have had to alter my original enthusiasm to a milder level of enjoyment... and an added irritation and impatience with the subject matter.What set my teeth against this film most recently was listening to the adolescent and emptyheaded commentary by Rupert Everett as interviewed in one of the special features on the DVD release. Looking at his feet as he speaks he drawls out something to the effect that life in England in the 30s was horrible. Really? I thought. I suppose life anywhere at anytime is always horrible for someone but most people seem to rub along quite nicely thank you very much. That train of thought got me onto the nature of rebels and causes and so on. Yes for homosexuals England was a harsh place to be with its brutal laws against such private behavior something that is always a danger when huge governmental systems get lawcrazy. But most homosexual men managed to have a good time and hold down decent careers a conclusion reached as a result of reading a great deal of historical biography from English men and women of the 20th century both gay and straight. Of course those people who managed to work within the system at the time would nowadays be dismissed as copouts by those in the gay community who willfully get in peoples' faces about their personal sexual preference. But not all gay people feel the need to air their personal behavior in public. But to return to the film I concluded that Guy Bennett Everett was simply a spoiled overindulged prat that's English for brat who would not curb his footinmouth problem with discretion and wisely keep his personal sexual preferences to himself as did most other people in that situation at the time.The English public school system was indeed a tough experience as I gather and prone to a militaristic and dutiful code of behavior that we today would find totally unacceptable for better or worse... that is arguable. But people at that time at least in the ruling classes felt it their duty to put country ahead of themselves and knuckled under to the system. We don't understand that now being a more selfindulgent and immature society.'Another Country' is the story of rebels without a cause or at least rebels with a questionable cause based on questionable motivations. That is where I have lost patience with this once highly revered film. It is still beautiful to watch however. The cinematography is superb as is the music and the acting. As a period piece showing the inner workings of a place like Eton College it is fascinating. The script such as it is is excellent.

I decided to feel my way blindly through it and did so happily as I'm a fan of Firth's work. I'm happy to say it exceeded any expectations I could have had and that it's one of those impressionable movies you think about for weeks. I never had seen Rupert Everett act in anything so he was a new face to me. I found his character to be compelling and quite loved the way he made him charming and witty but brilliant and beautiful too. Two of the best dialogues delivered in the movie were by Everett and he delivered them with so much passion I almost cried. The thing I loved the most about this movie was the friendship shared between Judd and Bennett. While most incredibly unlike Judd and Bennett were united in their charm and their difference. Judd a young communist and Bennett an openly gay man in a society so punishable of such acts. I found the relationship to be refreshing. The way Judd discredited Bennett's emotion as something unserious in one scene and the way Bennett lashed at him and told him how unfair it was that he did that was perhaps my favorite part. Both Firth and Everett delievered astounding performances for people that young and I'm surprised this didn't propel Firth into stardom before Pride and Prejudice did. I absolutely recommend this to anyone interested in films like Maurice or Call Me By Your Name and only wish that it had more popularity Another Country certainly is a hidden gem.".

We have new 'spies' and their stories to get excited about.All four or five spies have an interesting story to tell and to this day it is difficult to establish quite why the products of England's privileged class should have decided to bite the hand which fed them. Blunt certainly will have wanted to undo his past if only because the social position he attained as Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures was one which the old queen enjoyed a great deal. Philby seems since his childhood in India where until the age of five he spoke both English and Urdu fluently and daily played with the children of his parents servants to have suffered from a kind of split personality  I don't mean that in any medical sense  and had no difficulty hobnobbing with wealthy colleagues down in the club before meeting his controller and sending other colleagues to certain death. He was said to have been a real charmer so perhaps he was simply a sociopath who could not empathise.Anther Country is about Guy Burgess also like Blunt homosexual and if you don't know much about him the film's rather too neat explanation of why he became a traitor seems a tad glib. But in fact Burgess was nothing if not superficial. He seems to have been the least ideologically inspired of the Cambridge Four and being a huge drinker was a constant source of concern to the others and his Soviet controllers that he would while drunk give the game away.He and McLean were the first to break cover and head for Soviet Russia when it seemed likely that McLean a diplomat in Britain's Washington embassy was about to be unmasked. It has often been suggested that Burgess need not have fled no one was onto him and his treachery was only discovered once he had hightailed it to Moscow.Some even suggest that he fully expected to return to Britain though what he thought might be made of his actions back in London only the Lord knows. Certainly he didn't take to Moscow life and according to Wikipedia had all his clothes tailored in London's Savile Row and shipped to him in Moscow.The other notable aspect of Another Country is its portrayal of life at an English public school the name helpfully for Americans we give some of our private schools. The film takes place in the Thirties so I can't comment on whether aspects of such a school are exaggerated. But I attended a Roman Catholic public school as a boarder for five years in the Sixties and I can confirm that many of the absurdities prevailed as did the rigid hierarchy of boys. We were still being caned for the silliest of reasons  though we called it being beaten  though in the more enlightened Sixties this could no longer be done by prefects.The film takes place in the summer term when the air was sufficient balmy for the boys to take midnight walks or meet for midnight trysts. I remember many pleasant afternoons lying in the sunshine under a tree doing nothing but gazing through the leaves into a blue sky. But I also remember the sheer misery of having to bathe and shower in cold water  not for any character building but because the school was too tightfisted to get the hot water system modernised and repaired. I remember the goddam awful pigswill which we were served up as 'food' and the almost frightening speed with which violence could erupt for no very good reason. Oh and I also remember all the talk of 'minnows' and boys that someone 'fancied' though not of it thank God came my way.So I suspect Another Country holds a certain attraction for its portrayal of the kind of life lived at such a school although a portrayal now long outdated  corporal punishment is no longer legal at any school. The story is rather slight the boys rather too articulate speaking as they do as characters might in a play or a film. Or perhaps as I am now well beyond the age they were I simply can't remember how young folk talk and talked.The explanation as to what decided Guy BurgessBennett to choose the dark side and betray his country  because he had been cheated out of the bauble he craved more than any other  was perhaps a touch to pat. There again the real Guy Burgess was such a loose cannon who didn't seem to believe much for very long anyway perhaps it really was like that. The film is perhaps best viewed as a wellmade period piece.".

Having seen the high budget yawnfest Transformers I can actually say that given the current state of big budget science fiction this is a refreshing if a bit leftfield approach to the genre.Evidently my companion viewers in the cinema a small group of guys were not getting as much out of the deeply troubled love story that forms the basis of the plot and they made their discontent very audible to my irritation.In brief not a film for everyone but if you're in the mood for an introspective slowburner and you've got the patience for it this film will prove a rewarding experience".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. An award winning film at Sundance this one seems to carry the same polarizing effect that Tree of Life does. The reviews and comments have been discordant and contentious. After sitting through a QA with Mike Cahill cowriter director and Brit Marling cowriter star I am guessing they are taking great pride in the lovehate responses. Their film was designed to take you deep ... make you think and selfanalyze. This is not a fluffy Owen Wilson romcom. Explaining what it is well that's a challenge.The story begins with Rhoda Brit Marling out for a night of partying. We learn she has been accepted to M.I.T. and that she is quite the space and astronomy lover. Her very poor decision to drive home after drinking results in a horrific accident that changes her life and that of a young family. At the same time scientists discover another Earth has been hiding on the other side of the sun. Flash forward four years as Rhoda is released from prison.She is a broken spirit whose bright future has been dashed. She tracks down the man who survived the crash she caused and has every intention of apologizing. Instead she cleans his house. She finds John William Mapother has dropped out of society and found numbness in the bottle.I won't say more about the story because it is really something to watch unfold. What I will say is that I found the advertisements to be somewhat misleading. This is not a scifi film per se. Sure the second earth brings about numerous questions concerning the other us. What would we say? How would we react? Have I done better there than here? But that is actually an underlying element to this story ... always present in our thoughts and those of Rhoda. Instead this film is a psychological drama. And a dark one at that.You will recognize William Mapother The Grudge Lost who plays John. He has a regular guy look to him and stretches well from happiness to depression to once again showing a spark. Brit Marling is one you don't know but will soon enough. She is an amazing presence on screen and avoids the Hollywood acting crutches. She plays Rhoda as the damaged confused creature she is in the story. Very well done.A couple of other interesting notes include Kumar Pallana The Royal Tenenbaumsas Purdeep. With minimal screen time his character provides Rhoda with a lesson she needs. There is also a scene where John plays a saw as a musical instrument. The sound is amazing and the music is actually from Natalia Paruz who is knows as the saw lady. Other music in the film is outstanding and courtesy of Fall on Your Sword. Very unique but a perfect fit for the film.".

I mean we all can enjoy vampire and zombie movies right? Is any movie any better than Let the Right One In? I saw this movie last night in Brookline Mass at a QA preview with director writers and an actor  all combined in two lovely people. No one in our sophisticated audience that included a CETI scientist cared enough about the laws of physics problems to mention them in the question period. All we cared about were the endearing characters the music both acoustic and visual the plot developments the shocking climaxes the compelling emotional plausibility. The movie is not about anything as terrestrial as gravity. In the world of this movie something has happened to upset some kind of cosmic symmetry and the other earth has appeared from a parallel universe. I do wish some character or other had dispelled the physics with I don't know why our orbits are not affected. But the metaphor works as a way to discuss looking at oneself. It really does not matter. The acting is perfect the camerawork perfectly beautiful the plot deeply affecting with wonderful surprises.".

Then it keeps coming closer is soon apparently our same planet dubbed Earth II. The internal and emotionally scarred center of the film however is Rhoda Brit Marling who is just released from prison four years later after being convicted of vehicular manslaughter. As a 17 year old girl who just got accepted to MIT she drove drunk hit a car with a family in it and killed the pregnant wife and five year old boy.

Her family wants her to resume her life where she left off but her psyche will not allow that. So begins a deeply philosophical exploration on regret guilt forms of forgiveness and compassion all while a new mirrorimaged planet is coming closer and closer. Did Rhoda commit the same mistake on Earth II? Is that family torn apart or still together on that new planet? These and a host of other theories and possibilities are tossed around for the audience concerning not only a mirror planet but about past events and moving forward.In real life Brit Marling graduated from Georgetown with and economics degree and instead of pursuing a banking career with Goldman Sachs an offer she turned down took off for Hollywood. She was only offered smaller roles in cheap horror flicks. So instead of demeaning herself in garbage like that she sat down with the eventual director Mike Cahill and wrote her own script. Brilliant move. It was a much harder road to travel to write her own script and then get it picked up by Fox Searchlight who bought the distribution rights at Sundance but she pulled it off. It really is a breath of fresh air to see a film like this learn its back story and become immersed in it as opposed to whatever the most recent superhero movie is.".

	schema:reviewBody "O wad some Power the gift tae gie us to see oursels as ithers see us!  Robert Burns Beginning as a blue speck in the far distant horizon in four years a new planet resembling Earth has moved into our solar system creating a hovering phantomlike globe in the sky that puzzles scientists and laymen alike but brings a feeling of wonder to the night sky. Winner of the Alfred P. Sloan Feature Film and the Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival Mike Cahill's lowbudget film Another Earth is a quietly beautiful meditation on guilt redemption and second chances. Though it has some implausible elements it is so skillfully written and performed that these elements seem irrelevant. Cahill demonstrates that science fiction movies do not have to have blaring music unending frenzy CGI effects or ugly and violent monsters to successfully capture our imagination.The premise of the film is that the new planet is an exact mirror of the Earth containing a duplicate version of ourselves who mirror our earthly circumstances. Cahill's main focus however is not the new planet but the attachment between two damaged individuals who begin to bring each other back to life after a devastating incident that forever scarred their lives. As the film opens Rhoda Williams Brit Marling a bright 17year old unsteady after a night of celebrating her acceptance into MIT drives her car through a red light putting composer John Burroughs William Mapother in a coma and killing his pregnant wife and their young son.The film then jumps ahead four years when the still guiltridden and morose Rhoda is released from prison and tries to set her life in order moving back with her parents Kim Jordan Baker and Robert Flint Beverage and her brother Jeff Robin Taylor. Though she had planned on studying Astrophysics the only job she can now get is working as a high school janitor a job where she keeps to herself without much interaction with others. When she sees John placing a toy robot at the site of the accident on a whim she goes to his house pretending to be a maid offering a free trial for a cleaning service oddly called Maid in Heaven. In the back of her mind however is finding a way to release her inner torment. Fascinated with this sullen but obviously highly intelligent woman John takes her up on her offer and asks her to come back each week to clean his house. At first uncommunicative both verbally and emotionally the two alienated people slowly begin opening up to each other a little bit more each week. Though Rhoda eventually plans to tell John that she was responsible for the accident that killed his family their visits seem to bring them to a new awakening of what is possible in their life and she repeatedly postpones her confession.After listening to TV broadcasts talking constantly about the possibility that your identical twin on Earth 2 might be a happier and more satisfied version of you Rhoda enters a contest to become the first voyager to visit the other Earth. Astonishingly she wins first prize after a heart rendering essay describing the reasons she wants to go. At first pleading with her not to go through with it John's attitude is changed drastically after she reveals her complicity in the fatal accident a scene that leads to a startling and unpredictable conclusion.Supported by the ethereal sounds of the group Fall on Your Sword Another Earth engenders powerful performances that deserve recognition at awards time. Marling who also cowrote the film gives an intense and moving performance that brings her character fully to life. Though the film misses an important teachable moment near the end it is a quietly powerful work of art that suggests that truth lays more in inner than in outer space and that the biggest world to conquer is the one that is right before our eyes. As author Marcel Proust put it The real voyage of discovery lies in not seeing new landscapes but in having new eyes.".

It's not that great. It's not scifi. If you're thinking of another movie to compare this to no matter what you pick this one'll fall terribly short. To the facts Brit cowrote the movie she's gorgeous. I probably would've given up halfway if it wasn't for the mysteriousness she portrays. That face gawd! Made on a shoestring budget. Heck Brit had to do her costar's makeup in between shots. This is a movie made with passion and a lot of faith that they'd done good stuff. Well let me sorta paint my experience watching 'Another Earth'. Glued to my seat for an hour and a half almost as if this was a thriller? I'm serious. Captivated by the gorgeous shots of 'earth 2'. Waiting for the little streams of info being released ever so stringently  the announcement on the radio as they discover earth 2 and a whole bunch more. I've already mentioned how captivating Brit is. What? No Scifi? There's definitely food for the scifi enthusiast. The premise comes from a mixture of newage string theory of the multiverse kind. The ending'll have you wondering about Einsteinian spacetime implications. The core of the movie is largely philosophical. Forgiveness. Rebirth. etc. Kept me struggling throughout with my emotions about the main character. Past the acting. How much forgiveness can the viewer unleash? And is it justified? Chill out leave your expectations at the door. You may not like it. It's slow. It demands your attention so keep away from the caffeine. You might not feel the same way about Brit though. She's gorgeous. She really is. It's just a wellmade passionfilled indieflick. It's got some gorgeous imagery. The atmosphere constantly thick with color and emotion. This review's gone on way too long. Indie flick of the year? Gets my vote. Who cares? Oh BTW its possible your friends'll hate you for recommending this. Especially if they're the kind that finds it hard to appreciate photography artsy stuff maybe and don't have much patience you know generally. So there ya go one final reason for you to dig this flick. The fact that you like it  yeah it'll be one of those things you look back on and say 'Hey I really am different. I appreciate interesting deep stuff. I'm like an artist philosopher or something. neat!'. Holy hell. What? Is that really why I...".

Especially if they're the kind that finds it hard to appreciate photography artsy stuff maybe and don't have much patience you know generally. So there ya go one final reason for you to dig this flick. The fact that you like it  yeah it'll be one of those things you look back on and say 'Hey I really am different. I appreciate interesting deep stuff. I'm like an artist philosopher or something. neat!'. Holy hell. What? Is that really why I...";

	schema:reviewBody "Spoiler Alert!!! This comment is for those who have already seen the movie as my comments mainly pertain to the last scene.It would seem that most viewers didn't get something I just automatically figured out during the course of the movie...and this thing has to do with the broken synchronicity. Earth 1 and Earth 2 didn't just automatically start to become different something had to break synchronicity and those differences would only occur with the two planets interaction and then have to domino or butterfly effect from there. When she was driving in her car looking up to see the blue dot in the sky her double was doing the same thing. But the other planet was not a mirror image it was a duplicate so unlike in a mirror where when you raise your right hand you see your reflection raising its left hand what she saw was more like looking into a rorrim which is a type of mirror where things are not reversed so you actually see things as others would be looking at you and seeing things...the print of a book you are holding up to a rorrim isn't reversed and you can still easily read it and so on. When the blue dot was first noticed and the disc jockey was announcing it she looked up into the sky and her body double was also looking up but exactly where that blue dot was in the sky was different for the two of them. So given her body double's different positioning of her head her different angle of viewing she noticed the other car in time to brake or swerve and miss it. Similarly when Dr. Joan Tallis was on live TV making live radio contact at first she thought she was getting feedback because in reply to anything she said she was hearing the other Joan Tallis who was broadcasting the exact same radio message to her. This was a frustration for her until something different about the radio waves traveling through space meant that one of them would hear something differently and respond differently so that instead of just saying the same thing to each other at the same time back and forth one of them somehow responded differently Hello? Hello? as they undoubtedly had heard something different or failed to hear something because it was blocked by interference. Then their synchronicity was broken enough in that small way for the two of them to actually have a conversation and undoubtedly television viewers on Earth 2 might have experienced a small break in synchronicity as their Joan Tallis was answering the question about what she bought at the space store in Cape Canaveral so the viewers on Earth 2 didn't have their Joan Tallis holding up the words space strawberries on her yellow pad to possibly provoke the obvious reaction that Rhonda's brother on Earth 1 was having. And obviously Rhonda 2's brother didn't have a sister who went to prison so very likely in that family's life along with Rhonda 2's friends at MIT quite a bit of synchronicity had been broken by then. So the Rhonda 2 didn't crash did go to MIT did study astronomy or astrophysics which was her area of interest and won the contest for other reasons probably just for being a motivated MIT graduate student specializing in space and astronomy. She had nobody to consider giving up her space flight to since she didn't kill anybody's family. John Burroughs undoubtedly joined his family now having two fathers only one being slightly banged up and with minor head injury issues. This was already a question in my mind and in other viewers' minds whether by looking up at the sky at different angles the two Rhondas had broken synchronicity enough to where one of them had swerved and missed hitting the other car. The final scene didn't raise any questions at all rather it quickly and refreshingly answered the really biggest question that viewers who got it were already asking themselves and wondering about. For me that final scene was a magical and beautiful moment but not wonderful at all as it replied to all the wonder by answering every question and tyingup all the loose ends of the story very well at least as far as the story line was dealing with. Of course to follow the story one had to at least suspend belief enough to not stray from the story wondering about things like whether the two planets would be experiencing tsunami tides because of their gravitational pulls and such etc. There was no moral difference between the two Rhondas it's not that one of them decided to go the party and drink while the other didn't they were the same person they were the same drunk just one was a drunk trying to look at a blue dot in the sky over here while the other was a drunk trying to look at a blue dot in the sky over there. Face to face they should realize that were the same person until then only one like most drunk drivers just didn't end up in an accident by mere chance just dumb luck and nothing else.I just thought it was a wonderful movie and the final scene answered that wonderful with a terrific happy ending. The two Rhonda's certainly have a lot of catching up to do and undoubtedly John and Rhonda are the only people who ended up on the same planet as their other selves and the other shuttle passengers certainly arrived to notice little or no difference with the planet they left probably feeling more like returning astronauts than true space explorers. The Rhonda 1 and John 1 switch proved to be an additional but major break in synchronicity for the two Earths.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are more than a couple of things going on here. For the casual viewer this may be invisible to the naked eye. Having said that if you pay a little attention you will not only comprehend its core message you will begin to truly appreciate the concept behind its making. Do not be thrown off by its subtle science fiction elements. If you find yourself questioning its genre the actual story lies firmly wedged between drama and art. For this reviewer the scifi aspect stands as a metaphor that powers the film's message.17 year old Rhoda Williams Brit Marling has just been accepted into MIT Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her celebration is shortlived when after a night of partying crashes her car into a vehicle driven by John Burroughs' William Mapother instantly killing his wife and son. Although Rhoda appears to be intoxicated her distraction comes from a radio broadcast stating the discovery of a planet that closely resembles Earth. Four years later Rhoda is released from prison her spirit broken and dreams shattered she takes up a janitor's position at a local school. At this point there are various theories about the other planet. When contact is made it is established that the other planet is in fact a mirror Earth having entered our solar system from a parallel dimension. Preparations are made to travel to the other Earth and Rhoda participates in a competition to become one of the first civilians to accompany astronauts to the approaching mirror Earth. After cleaning the school for some time Rhoda approaches John with the intention of apologizing for her carelessness but loses her nerve and poses as a maidtoorder cleaner. A music professor at Yale John has become an alcoholic with disregard for his profession ever since the accident. He buys into Rhoda's pretence and has her clean his house once a week. In time she helps him overcome his grief but never discloses who she really is. Just when they seem to be drawn to each other Rhoda wins the competition to travel to the other Earth. She must now decide between confronting her demons and telling John the truth or escape her past and start a new life on the other Earth. Until this point the story unfolds remarkably in an easy to watch evenly paced narrative. As a viewer I was captivated right from the start. Cowritten by Marling and director Mike Cahill the screenplay has impeccable character detail relating to ample areas that allow us to probe within our own faults and limitations. As the lead character Rhoda Williams is a bright individual with an even brighter future who throws it all away with just one stupid mistake. How many of us can look within ourselves and honestly claim that we have never made a mistake worth regretting? If you can raise a hand to that question then you must be a renowned hero or one very selfrighteous individual. Cahill's biggest accomplishment is in Rhoda's character study An intelligent and ambitious teenager reduced to a confused and troubled adult but a wiser one having learnt from her mistake. In giving life to this character Marling is flawless and ironically powerful as a helpless woman fallen from grace. After this movie I can only expect that we are about to see a lot more of Marling in the years to come. William Mapother as John is almost as inspiring as a man who has lost everything but the heart to recovery. With nothing to lose it is always easy to give up on life but Mapother does an exceptional turn around with John and gives closure to his character. Kumar Pallana has very few scenes in this movie but plays a vital role in mentoring Rhoda into redemption. He does this without much dialogue but with uncanny screen charisma. As a debut directorial Cahill also gets top credit for the picture postcard cinematography. Beautiful would be an understatement. We have cinematography dependent films with similar themes in GATTACA and SOLARIS but nothing compares to the way Cahill renders his landscape in this movie. Also noteworthy is the pulsating score used sparingly but effectively. Additionally there is a scene on how to make music using a tool that is usually annoying to the ear. Amazing! For a shoestring budget this film did not win two awards at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival by potluck. That alone should silence haters for questioning the film's scientific logic or lack of. This is not about conquering another planet done to death! or alien invasions. It is about redemption through selfdiscovery and reinvention of one's self esteem by learning from the past and learning to let go of the past. It is about looking at a mirror image of one's self as opposed to assuming everything is perfect. For a drama this film is as beautiful as it is poetic. Just don't expect any eyepopping special effects. There are tons of other movies catering to that need.".

In the local case the girl got away scotfree. This movie's protagonist not only doesn't get away unscathed she struggles in an utterly humane way to overcome her guilt. For that Brit Marling is an exquisite choice of actress who held my attention and sympathy throughout. All the more impressive because she shared writing credits with the director Cahill.This is an artful if bare bones film that you will forgive for having to resort to fantasy to make its points.

	schema:reviewBody "I have listed this as a spoiler just in case although I provide no details regarding the outcome of the film. I merely hint at things.I went into Another Earth with hopes of finding something unique. After all the trailer log line and tasteful stills all pointed to the idea that Mike Cahill's pet project was something different than what I was used to.I was mistaken. Badly so.Disappointment cannot even begin to convey my feelings towards this film. The most heartbreaking aspect of Another Earth is that it fails to deliver an emotional payoff despite consistently setting up emotionalanchored scenarios. Rhoda Brit Marling hits and kills the child and wife of John Burroughs William Mapother. She sees the bodies and CUT! we jump to four years later to find her back with the family whom I might add seem bizarrely awkward around their daughter. She was in jail not Siberia for the last four years. Did no one ever think to put visitor hours to good use?. We don't see the real emotional impact of her mistake because she comes home a living zombie empty quiet deadpan and flat out boring.Which leads me to another problem depressed people don't have Legobrick personalities. And if they do they don't star as lead characters in films unless we're talking Twilight. Cahill seems to believe the only way to convey guilt is to make Rhoda an unkempt rag doll with an expressionless face. To him having her stare off into space for thirty seconds shows just how emotionally deep her problems run. For us in the audience it means it's time to check our watches.The silence in the film and there's a LOT of it doesn't tell us anything about Rhoda. Instead it acts as a precursor to a lot of overly artsy shots that make you think about how much color correction they did in post. In fact this entire film could run as a series of photographic stills after all it seems to care more about how pretty Earth 2 looks into the sky than the emotional struggles of the girl standing beneath it.Dialogue is contrived painfully so. If you've watched even one Hollywood film you can probably guess each and every line before it's said. Things fall in a predictable fashion and characters flip flop personalities depending on what the plot calls for. There are numerous points over which characters throw massive fits only to dismiss the same problem a scene later.And then of course there's the blatant unrealism of it all. No I'm not talking about Earth 2. I can suspend my disbelief for that. What I'm talking about is the set up between Rhoda and John. Despite what John's been through he's not an idiot it shouldn't take him an hour and ten minutes to figure out Rhoda's not who she says she is.Another Earth expects you to ignore basic logic in order to swallow even the most simple of moments. It interprets suspension of disbelief as meaning you can't judge this film because it's artsy. This film lacks the depth it so desperately attempts to flaunt. It comes off cheesy pretentious shallow and selfobsessed. Characters pinball through events and come out as empty as they started. The ones that do change do so without any real good reason. There's no pleasure to be had in watching this film unless you absolutely love staring at empty motiveless images and characters for long periods of time. But if that's the case I recommend watching a Discovery Channel doc. At least you'll be learning something.To conclude Another Earth is a complete waste for anyone looking to enjoy themselves. It delivers nothing in exchange for your time and money and expects you to come out praising it for its unique delivery. Do your eyes wallet and gas tank a favor and avoid.".

This movie has so many holes that I wish the writers would have received some notes because nothing in this film makes sense. Problem one The other Earth has been hidden behind the sun that's why we couldn't see it all these years we have been exploring the cosmos? Makes no sense. Planting this other planet in our solar system was a huge mistake. Problem two It takes four years to contact and travel to the other Earth when it is ten times bigger in the sky then our own moon? Makes no sense. It does not take four years to travel to the moon and we have been doing it since 1969. Problem three Brit Marling's character's name was not revealed to William Mapother's because she was a minor? She was a senior in high school and off to MIT so I don't think she would be a minor and even if she was I'm sure the victim of the accident would be in the trial and see her face. You can ask the audience to take one leap of faith but not multiple ones. If this movie had just been a film about star crossed lovers it would've been much better off. The scifi element is completely unnecessary and treats the audience like morons and William Mapother is no leading man. He is super creepy. The secondary actors were sub par. Mr Littlejeans from Royal Tenenbaums makes an appearance that is just laughable. There is random voiceover from a character that is not relevant to the film. You don't even find out who it is until late in the third act. I'm sure there are people that are going to disagree with my review and that is fine but for anyone who is a scifi fan looking for a scifi movie this is not for you. The best scifi film I have seen at Sundance was Primer and I highly recommend that over this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another Earth is a combination of irritating predictability of storytelling and imaginative genre hybridisation which makes big promises but fails to fully deliver. The director Mike Cahill uses a car crash as a central plot device and right after start falls into a major clich which was so tirelessly exploited in the past by directors like Alfonso Gonzales Innaritu who based 2 of his films on a very similar idea. The young girl who causes a car accident and kills the main character's family seeks redemption and forgiveness and slowly falls in love with the man. But who can blame her? Both characters have their demons but are so likable we all feel that they deserve to achieve what they set out for. The man should get his family back and the girl should be finally forgiven  which all fulfils in the end. What saves the drama from being a complete overkill is the sciencefiction plot line that runs parallel to dramatic struggle of the couple of protagonists. At the moment of the accident scientists make a discovery of another Earth that appears in the distance. The discovery echoes hope that the other world might still have the lives of the loved ones that the main character lost in the beginning of the film. The scene when a governor communicates with the exact same copy of herself living on the other planet is one of the most intriguing of the entire film. It elevates a somewhat lame story to a whole new level of possible outcomes asking questions about the meaning of life and escaping ones destiny. Sadly the director articulates these philosophical matters very softly and fills his story with unnecessary love tale and ends with a cliffhanger which makes us go 'What the hell?' rather than 'Wow!'Still as Another Earth is Cahill's first feature film he should be given a bit of credit for making a wholesome solid plot. Hopefully in his feature he will take risks more courageously as there is a lot of potential in the way he ties indie film with the school of existentialism.".

The premise of this movie is interesting yet most if not all of the glaring problems of that premise are not addressed.

Also take into consideration the number of times we see a contradiction between the location of Earth 1's illumination source Sun and Earth 2's which are notably different in several scenes. Now I realize that a suspension of some disbelief is required for the enjoyment of fictional stories but the gaping chasms that my disbelief was required to span were simply preposterous. I had to rewatch several scenes to convince myself that I had not fallen asleep thereby missing important content that might explain some of the film's gaps in it's own storyline.Sometimes I can't help but wonder if the IMDb's rating system is easily hacked or not subject to a large enough number of reviews to earn a rating.

	schema:headline " This was the worst movie I have seen in the longest time. I actually signed up to let everyone know.";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't even know where to begin however I have to start somewhere...Let's start with the IMDb rating. Somehow it managed to receive a 7 Rating. A 7 IMDb? Really?! You gave this movie a 7?!?! This was one of the worst movies in all of film history. Without question. How is it even remotely possible that this movie received any rating above a 3? It was so terrible I couldn't even finish it. I finish EVERY movie and that's goes to show you how awful it was. I stopped it halfway and decided to go back to it later on after feeling bad about not giving it a chance. I said to myself Well I started it and just like every other movie I at least have to give it the benefit of the doubt by finishing it. This lasted me maybe another 15 minutes until it was completely ruined by the most obscene segment of the entire movie. Suddenly out of no where Rhoda stands facing a wall throws off her shirt John walks over they start kissing. Then this completely random passionate love making scene ensues. I laughed out loud literally. It was a complete WTF YOU HAVE TO BE JOKING! moment. Firstly it doesn't fit at all in the movie. Let alone in any of the scenes. The movie doesn't take that course. It doesn't even have the time to develop to take that course. Secondly it's disgusting. Why you ask? Brit Marling looks like she's fifteen. William Mapother looks like your typical 50something year old guy. It's not a pretty sight to see it has pedophilia written all over it. It's so out of place it instantly brings me back to the following question. A 7? Really IMDb a  7? Moving along...In all honesty the movie really is great concept. I like the parallel universe quantum mechanic ideas that are thrown around. Yet the biggest problem the movie faces is that these notions they aren't really divulged into at all in this movie. It's sort of a side story. It's there The other Earth. There are scenes that infrequently appear that are related to Earth 2. Nevertheless it has absolutely nothing to do with the main story line. Let's get into that a little bit the main story. The most unrealistic plot I've ever seen. Now this has nothing to do with the parallel Earth theories. They are very realistic actually almost factual at this point in time because of the Drake Equation and Quantum Physics. My problem is with the actual story line. You know the one that would never actually happen and really makes no sense. Rhoda for some odd reason develops this sick obsession with the person's life she destroyed. It's not a let me go apologize to free my conscience obsession the obsession being the guilt you are left with for taking a person's life on accident. Instead it's I'm going to get to know this person for some reason. Not tell him who I am clean his house  him and well that's about as far as I got into the movie because I couldn't take the senselessness any longer. She goes over there and pretends to be a part of some maid service. Cleaning his house for free? Yeah that will pay off the debt that you owe him for destroying his family. Yeah cleaning his house for free will bring back his wife and son. Yeah ing him will bring back those cherished moments he shared with his wife and child. I'm hoping you detect my sarcasm if it's not flagrant enough. In all honesty that's what you have to look forward to in this movie. Forget the fact that you think you are going to watch a movie that actually is based on its synopsis. It's not. It's almost like the people who were involved in making this movie couldn't make up their minds on what type of a movie they wanted to develop. Do I want to make a SciFi movie? Do I want to make an Indie movie? Do I want a Drama? Do I want a Love Story? No instead I want all of those genres in one big giant cluster of a movie that is thrown together goes nowhere and is all over the place. That's the end result. Poorly executed everything.Let's talk about the music dreadful. No I'm being generous atrocious. I enjoy classical music. This instead was like you gave a toddler a violin and said Ok start making music! Not to mention IT'S THE SAME ANNOYING SOUND IN EVERY SCENE. It's like they ran out of money for a soundtrack and said Ok let's wing it. Go grab Bob from the back and give him this violin. Record him playing. That will be our soundtrack...Now the acting. The acting quality was the equivalent of that on General Hospital. No I'm wrong again they might actually be better on that show. Only thing is there is barely any dialog in the entire movie. Most scenes are quite vapid meaningless transitions. That about sums up the movie utter trash. Don't waste your time if you have even half a brain. If you have no brain you might enjoy it like the people on this website. Maybe there is a parallel Earth where this movie never made it to release. Maybe there is a parallel Earth where this movie got its deserved rating of a 1. All we can do is wonder...".

	onyx:emotionText "I don't even know where to begin however I have to start somewhere...Let's start with the IMDb rating. Somehow it managed to receive a 7 Rating. A 7 IMDb? Really?! You gave this movie a 7?!?! This was one of the worst movies in all of film history. Without question. How is it even remotely possible that this movie received any rating above a 3? It was so terrible I couldn't even finish it. I finish EVERY movie and that's goes to show you how awful it was. I stopped it halfway and decided to go back to it later on after feeling bad about not giving it a chance. I said to myself Well I started it and just like every other movie I at least have to give it the benefit of the doubt by finishing it. This lasted me maybe another 15 minutes until it was completely ruined by the most obscene segment of the entire movie. Suddenly out of no where Rhoda stands facing a wall throws off her shirt John walks over they start kissing. Then this completely random passionate love making scene ensues. I laughed out loud literally. It was a complete WTF YOU HAVE TO BE JOKING! moment. Firstly it doesn't fit at all in the movie. Let alone in any of the scenes. The movie doesn't take that course. It doesn't even have the time to develop to take that course. Secondly it's disgusting. Why you ask? Brit Marling looks like she's fifteen. William Mapother looks like your typical 50something year old guy. It's not a pretty sight to see it has pedophilia written all over it. It's so out of place it instantly brings me back to the following question. A 7? Really IMDb a  7? Moving along...In all honesty the movie really is great concept. I like the parallel universe quantum mechanic ideas that are thrown around. Yet the biggest problem the movie faces is that these notions they aren't really divulged into at all in this movie. It's sort of a side story. It's there The other Earth. There are scenes that infrequently appear that are related to Earth 2. Nevertheless it has absolutely nothing to do with the main story line. Let's get into that a little bit the main story. The most unrealistic plot I've ever seen. Now this has nothing to do with the parallel Earth theories. They are very realistic actually almost factual at this point in time because of the Drake Equation and Quantum Physics. My problem is with the actual story line. You know the one that would never actually happen and really makes no sense. Rhoda for some odd reason develops this sick obsession with the person's life she destroyed. It's not a let me go apologize to free my conscience obsession the obsession being the guilt you are left with for taking a person's life on accident. Instead it's I'm going to get to know this person for some reason. Not tell him who I am clean his house  him and well that's about as far as I got into the movie because I couldn't take the senselessness any longer. She goes over there and pretends to be a part of some maid service. Cleaning his house for free? Yeah that will pay off the debt that you owe him for destroying his family. Yeah cleaning his house for free will bring back his wife and son. Yeah ing him will bring back those cherished moments he shared with his wife and child. I'm hoping you detect my sarcasm if it's not flagrant enough. In all honesty that's what you have to look forward to in this movie. Forget the fact that you think you are going to watch a movie that actually is based on its synopsis. It's not. It's almost like the people who were involved in making this movie couldn't make up their minds on what type of a movie they wanted to develop. Do I want to make a SciFi movie? Do I want to make an Indie movie? Do I want a Drama? Do I want a Love Story?

	schema:reviewBody "Just what is it about indie science fiction that is so fascinating? Maybe it's the idea that great effects are done on a small budget. Or maybe it's the simple fact that it's indie filmmaking. Regardless of pretense or the filmmaker's confinements indie movies of the lesser genres action horror scifi etc. almost always impress Another Earth being no exception to this general rule.Another Earth marks a marvelous turn that most scifi movie writers are too scared to take and that is into the realm of a character drama. Mike Cahill's thoughtprovoking debut as director and writer and cinematographer and editor is a risky venture but it almost always works. Unfortunately Cahill has concocted a premise that is too interesting for his small pensive movie but the beautiful Brit Marling makes it possible to ignore most of the film's most glaring issues as she sweeps the audience away with her acting.It's best to go into Another Earth without any outside knowledge but if you've come to this page you probably know too much already. Here is your chance to leave before I begin with story details...Still with me? Good. Another Earth is centered around Rhoda Williams Brit Marling an MIT student who becomes frenzied after she finds out that scientists have discovered a planet nicknamed Earth 2. Earth 2 is the same in composition as our earth however the problem is that Earth 2 has suddenly moved from behind the sun and into view in our night sky. Rhoda drunkenly leaves a party and drives away only to accidentally hit another family's car while she is stargazing. The mother and child are killed the father William Mapother on the other hand is left in a coma. Four years later Rhoda is released from jail and the father awakens from his coma. It's up to Rhoda to find the courage to apologize and right what she has done wrong.Visually Another Earth is an impressive film. There's a constant reminder that the film is independentCahill is forced to rely on grainy handheld shots for some of the film's most beautiful momentsand yet it's very welldone for a film that supposedly cost 150000 to make. Cahill returns to his roots in filming sharks and jellyfish for National Geographic by giving the human form a feeling of mystique. There are quite a few shots of Rhoda walking in slowmotion Earth 2 looming in the background. But it's all worth it the viewer is constantly introduced to the world's cruelty and ugliness but Cahill has somehow made it serene and strangely inviting.Whether or not Another Earth could have possibly held together without great actors is something that should be called into question. Brit Marling gives the performance that every actress wants to give. She adds a seemingly impossible amount of depth to the character of Rhoda. We feel her pain constantly and it's all thanks to Marling. Marling is worthy of a Best Actress nomination for her work in Another Earth. Although William Mapother is not to be ignored either. Maybe you've seen him on Lost when he played Ethan however here he doesn't play a baddie. He's honest and human in his sliceoflife performance.Another Earth isn't perfect in fact it's far from it. The interesting ideas of two earths a whole new you and fear of doppelgangers is underused if not absent entirely. The ending is without a doubt science fiction at its best however it's really the only scene in the movie that is pure scifi. The ending could be a twist but I'm not going to call it that because the ending is just as subtle as the rest of the movie. Nevertheless it packs a punch. Cahill should feature the same premise in his next film but this time he should entertain all the special effects that everyone wanted to see in this one.At the Sundance Film Festival this year Another Earth won the Alfred P. Sloan Prize an award given to the film that best portrays a scifi story. There may not have been many movies at Sundance that could have qualified but there's no question that Another Earth deserved. Cahill's first movie is quiet wellmade and has the makings of an indie classic. Brit Marling and William Mapother's chemistry perfectly fits Cahill's excellent script causing the audience to ponder What if...? for the entire movie. It's mystifying science fiction the kind without explosions and the kind without little green men. And Cahill proves that this this lofi destructive and emotionally tense meditation may be the best kind of science fiction.".

Sure it's not for the weak of heart or the religious fundamentalist but who cares? It's good dirty fun about love sex desire and friendship. Sure it's a fantasy world with understanding parents hot teachers no homophobia and true love but that was my favorite thing about the movie. Also loved the cameos from Graham Norton Richard Hatch Scott Thompson and many others. I shall never look at Graham Norton the same way. See this movie it's totally great...".

And no not because it is gross and not because there is too much sex but because there is not one single funny moment in the entire movie. I sat there stupefied  too inert to turn the damned thing off. I saw Todd Stephens' Edge of Seventeen and OK it was kind of amateurish but it had a good heart. This movie has nothing but kind of cute guys. That's it. And I agree with other posters that much of the parody is or should be extremely offensive to gays or lesbians or Asians or really most anyone. And it doesn't even show that much skin despite what other reviewers have said. It is not full of frontal nudity  it has a single closeup of Richard Hatch's johnson.Friends recommended this movie and maybe it's better seen in a theater full of people rather than rented and seen at home as I did but the laughter would be by association rather than anything genuinely funny in the movie. I also watched Little Miss Sunshine on DVD at home and it had me laughing out loud.Run as far away as you can from this movie. Rent something by John Waters. Anything. Amazingly incredibly bad.".

The talent of Lypsinka was absolutely wasted here in this pile of waste. I watched this in a theatre of about ten other people and there was very little laughter throughout what seemed like an eternity dragging on. I would not only not recommend anyone seeing it but I would recommend anyone to act as if this politically incorrect godawful film never existed. Was it trying to make a political statement? Was it parodying American Pie? Was it parodying itself? Was it trying to be a poor man's John Walters uh if that's even possible.

So now we have some lame filmmakers who not only go an emulate these brainless hetero teen movies but they make them into basic softcore gay sex porn with a bunch of really lowbrow dumb gay jokes that even the stupidest straight person could probably come up with.

There is nothing American Conservative about this move it has a fresh crisp feeling to it the footage is fantastic. The humor and the jokes are over the top well unless you can't tolerate full frontal nudity open discussion about all kinds of sex from carrots to Belgian Chocolate you will find out what this is. One thing is for sure the religious right and the conservative wing of the world will scream if they see this move. But they don't have to. We all have a choice. And with that being said if you want to get a laughter or better said an evening of laughter go see this movie when it opens up on July 28. It is said there will be a Blockbuster version of it but honestly there will be nothing left once censorship strikes. This movie is a blast! Wow! ....and no one paid me to say this!".

Jarod Jonathan Chase seems to have little trouble attracting studs like Beau studly James Getzlaff and Griff Mitch Morris is stricken with the hunky stripper Angel the ever so buff Darryl Stephens. Each young man finds the trail to loss of virginity a trial but it all comes together 'in the end'.Films like this are tough to pull off audiences think they will be offended by the fairly frank and inside jokes.

Its a kind of weird parody of American Pie but the humor is much more rude than necessary I think. I don't mind the gay people but that movie is not for everyone. American Pie has rude humor but much more closer to the teenager's problemsYup the sex in early ages is a kind of problem This one has funny moments too but I will not allow my kid to see this one. My wife did not like what she saw in the first 10 minutes and went out of the room. Because of a strange curiosity Im about to see the whole movie. May be somewhere deep inside Im gay ?!?  If I was gay that movie would offend me. Its kind of gross the moment with the vegetables in the beginning of the movie. Not every gay people are such grotesques as the main heroes in the movie. Lesbians are not necessary big fat girls. So I find that movie as offense for gay people and for everyone who wants to have a good time never mind the sexual orientation. A gay comedy  a perfect gay comedy is The Birdcage thats my opinion. California is the other pole of the genre. So I think that is important not the subject of the movie but the way it is shown. As a father of son I would not recommend him to watch this one. Might be funny but offensive. Correct me if Im wrong  may be Im not familiar with the problems of gay people but I think that this one does not represent the real problems and not everyone gay will be charmed to see this.Today is 28november. I've read almost every comment about that movie. And I find that people who define themselves as gay are totally amazed with this piece of misunderstanding. Well people if you wanted a gay movie then buy yourself a gay adult movie. This one is a kind of that especially with the picture of a man with a whole arm up his rear... or a photo of the man with the erected penis. What of these suppose to be funny ? I have laughed so much in American Pie when the main hero laid the pie. It was funny  really funny because of the problem with losing of the virginity. I could imagine that boys and girls who find themselves as gay has a very hard period the define themselves as gay and to expose themselves as gay. This one is probably really hard. But there has to be limitations the scene with the mouse behind was totally disgusting and absolutely NOT FUNNY. The scene with Butt Plugs and other kind of stuff with the relations father  son was NOT FUNNY at all. In American Pie the father of the boy shows understanding of the problem but there was a funny moment of the embarrassment. This scene does not has this spirit at all. So I am agree with brandon2084 Not funny sex was distracting humor had no witcleverness. Stolen ideaAmerican Pie Distracting sex No humor. Total CRAP.".

	schema:reviewBody "ANOTHER GAY MOVIE must represent some sort of milestone  and nadir  in gay cinema. For the longest time gay themes were rare in movies and if dealt with at all homosexuality was suggested SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER hidden in subtext REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE or a subject of secondary concern KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN. When homosexuality came to the forefront there had to be a reason to justify the matter to teach a lesson about AIDS PHILADELPHIA to deliver a heavyhanded social commentary MAKING LOVE or to wallow in camp in order to rub queer culture in straight America's face THE RITZ THE BIRDCAGE JEFFERY etc.. The point is that a gay movie however you define the term had to serve a purpose because the opportunity to show gay life was so rare that filmmakers couldn't dare waste it. ANOTHER GAY MOVIE shows we have reached a time when such an opportunity can be wasted here is a movie with no motive no message no point. It just wants to entertain  and the fact that it doesn't even do that reveals that even a wasted opportunity can be wasted. The film's generic title implies that we have also reached a point where gay cinema is so plentiful that there are ample clichs to both justify making a movie selfsatire and to give it a generic title as in SCARY MOVIE NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE DATE MOVIE and even MOVIE MOVIE. And though that may be true you couldn't tell it from this film which despite the misleading title is not really about gay cinema or gay life or even a gay lifestyle. Though ANOTHER GAY MOVIE will mostly attract gay audiences it is homophobic in the worst way imaginable it uses the standard straightboy coming of age premise purely as an excuse for making gays once again the butt of all the jokes. The snide little homophobic slurs that were once used as hurtful asides now make up the entire film. Worse than merely being a straight movie in gay drag it is an antigay movie in gay drag. For reasons that aren't clear ANOTHER GAY MOVIE strives to be a gay version of the horny teenager movie a coming of age tale which has always been a purely heterosexual genre. From PORKY'S to AMERlCAN PIE the focus of such films has always been the sexual humiliation of young American males punishing boys for well being boys. Such films are always seen as being sexist  antiwoman  because they tend to objectify females but it is always the guys who bare the brunt of the real abuse. Such films may seem amoral yet they're really condescendingly moralistic seeing sex as being basically dirty. Their message seems to be that sex is natural but degrading  human but animalistic. These unsophisticated lowbrow films sell sex while showing nothing but contempt for the very people who come to them in the hopes of enjoying the sex. Why any gay film would shoot so low for inspiration is a mystery but that is AGM's sorrowful aim. The film features three tired stereotypes from the horny teenager genre  the boastful jock the knowitall nerd and the sexobsessed boynextdoor. The fourth musketeer in the group is an overthetop sissyboy of the FABulous sort whose grating presence is annoying even in genuine gay movies. These four clich characters are justgraduated openly gay high school boys who vow to each other to lose their virginity before college. In horny teenager fashion this sets each up for humiliation only changing the sexual orientations from straight to gay. Different cruel jokes  same cheesy punch lines.As unbelievable as the notion that these handsome young men can't find sex partners is the idea that these types gay or straight would be hanging together at school or any place else on earth. This is further tested by the addition of a fifth wheel a loudmouth slob of a butchlesbian whose overt masculinity is supposed to underscore just what little sissies the male characters are. The assumption that all gay people are buddies is just one of the film's minor inscrutable bigotries. But then the whole film exists in a strange fairyland where everyone is gay and obsessed with sex homophobia doesn't exist and no one notices that Mom is a guy in drag. The four main actors  Michael Carbonaro boynextdoor Jonah Blechman sissy Jonathan Chase jock and Mitch Morris nerd  at least bravely face each degrading situation with good grace doing what they can with terrible creepy material. It's difficult to admire their work here but they are personable enough that you hope they have the talent to overcome this embarrassment. Let's generously assume they just desperately needed the money. There is far less reason to be charitable with director and cowriter Todd Stephens who is best known for making the 1998 film EDGE OF SEVENTEEN a wellreceived and sweet little coming of age drama  which come to think of it had all the gay clichs that should have been in this film if it indeed had been about being gay. Watching this film is like watching a black comedian telling racist jokes he is supposed to be in on the joke rather than the butt of it but whether the joke is funny or not it is still laced with hate. And though it is all supposed to show just how absurd the images are like most lame satire the jokes reinforce rather than challenge. This film doesn't even qualify as being campy. Camp is a vaguely defined term but certainly its hallmark is its joyous selfmockery. Camp can be naughty and it can be dangerous but it is not mean. ANOTHER GAY MOVIE is just mean  and petty and shallow it has no right to use the word gay in any of its forms.".

I had never seen a movie with characters so fake and vain. it was just a camera going after some actors doing aimless and boring acts WHICH WERE SUPPOSED TO MAKE US LAUGH. the plot was so shallow and nonsense that words are unable to describe! after all what do u expect from a movie who tries to be the gay version of American pie and even copies some of its scenes exactly as the original? If you want to see a serious movie a good movie a gay themed movie or just a funny movie this is DEFINITELY not the choice.".

Anyone who knows me know that I adore awful cinema and Stephens' previous film the touching dramedy Gypsy 83 ranks among my alltime favorites. So when a friend recommended this I was excited about it... until I actually saw it.As pointed out here before unlike Another Teen Movie this one really only spoofs one film the first American Pie which I think is incredibly overrated but not without its charm  and actually it's less of a spoof than a ripoff. The leads are charismatic but they can't overcome the many shortcomings of the script. The grossouts are grossouts for the sake of being gross not for humor secondary characters go nowhere a blind chick Mommy Dearest bad clichs and stereotypes abound and the main characters get stuck in seemingly random painfully unfunny situations. The only storyline that really has any charmmerit revolves around two friends who come finally to the realization that they're in love with one another. Yes there's a couple frontal shots nothing special and a lot of bare rears but they only enforce the awful gay stereotypes. Well directed well acted for the most part but juvenile inanely moronic utter dreck.I hope Stephens goes back to dramedies where his films seem to be wellreceived Edge of 17 Gypsy 83 because he obviously doesn't know how to handle flatout comedy. And as for the many guys who seem to identify with this film what exactly are you smoking?".

This review is based on the DVDThis gay sendup of teen movies notably American Pie is an unclever uninspired road accident of a film. Its mere 90 minutes pass in what seems like hours as one unfunny gaginducing gag follows another. Character development doesn't need be subtle in such films but you should at least be able to tell the characters apart which the friend I saw this with had trouble doing. There are a few good laughs all at least halfway through the film and even a couple of sweet tender moments. But they're not worth hunting for amid the wreckage.To use a euphemism from the film this is a steaming piece of Belgian chocolate... probably even for fans of broad crude parodies or that genre of comedies in which actors in their twenties play teenagers trying to lose their virginity. It features several talented people who I hope will continue to find gainful employment in vehicles worthier of their time and ours.".

Why put stereotypical Asians with awful bad accents in the movie ? As a joke ? It's obviously contrived and perpetuates stereotypes of AsianAmericans. There's also a retarted bedroom scene where a major character wears a kimono and immediately starts taking incredibly small steps.B. The makeup and hair styles of one of the main characters looked like they were trying to be edgey even though it failed miserably. The makeup comes across as a drag queen who obviously was stuck in the 90's raver culture. If they wanted that major character to be the femmy fashionista. Put the character in some gucci  prada  miu miu apparell and call it a day.C. The typical latino character who barely gets any action. Ontop of that he's also a stripper. I'm sure he was put in for the token black guy.Honestly. The production value of the movie is halfdecent. I think the part where the film failed miserably was in the actors who don't even look like highschool students and the script. The oneliners weren't funny. The twists to the plot were obvious and contrite.I just find this movie to be repulsive selfhating and racist.If the movie was going to make fun of minorities women blind girlfriends fat people crazy butch lesbians femmy boys gay top's that are secretly bottoms incest sextoys oversized dildo's water sports scat poppers leather sex with Richard Hatch and an Asian girl that can barely speak English well they failed miserably. It's not like South Park. Watch another movie.The only great thing about the movie was its title.The super butch lesbian character definitely had her slight moments.".

The humor is sick beyond belief and there are constant scenes of sexual humiliation of the most disgusting kind. More than once I seriously considered leaving. I realize there IS an audience for this type of movieI guess I'm not it. To make it worse all these characters are fairly likable and seeing them constantly being humiliated or suffering severe pain and abuse especially Andy is not my idea of fun. There's also a fat aggressive terribly stereotyped lesbian in this who I seriously wanted to shut up. To make matters worse the actors REALLY overact shamelessly sometimes and jokes about NAMBLA are NOT funny. The few funny parts have take offs on Carrie and Mommie Dearest and the film DOES look good...but I was mostly appalled by what I saw. I give it a 1 but this DOES have an audience. Proceed at your own risk. BTW it's not rated but would get an NC17 QUICKLYthere is plenty of male nudity in this.".

Now if you note the continuity here as in American Pie you can watch that some scenes are exactly in its base the same thing. The characters here is four guys One lead Andy Wilson Michael Carbonaro one nerd Griff Mitch Norris one straightlike Jarod Jonathan Chase and a effeminate one Nico Jonah Blechman as i understand he work too in Luster a film of Everett Lewis. The guys want bring and In spite they don't want to accept it receive in sex. They want their first time. And more when Fluffer the experimented lesbian  Ashlie Atkinson  gives to them the lesson of success. The other characters can be easily noted quickly The closeted bisexual father of Andy his Mommie Dearest That was funny. The sexual fantasy of Andy his teacher A surprise to see Graham Norton here. Bonnie Nico's mom. Angel a striptease teacher who is in loved of Griff and the guy want to have sex with Jarod. This are at least the most important characters for the movie and is at the same time a good proof of how the gay stereotypes in movies go on in middle of social messages of equality and respect for gay people. Im sure that this is a gay movie made of gay people or at least a part of it and is surprising but this movie could be come a kind of funny but at the same time i hope that is not my impression but i see it so offensive.If we can called that follows the same tradition of Scary Movies and obviously of the Another movie ... kind started i think by Not Another Teen Movie the spoof here works too with the dirty things mixed then with the American Pie gags. But here and that was the problem of American Pie too is that the character's sexuality is humiliated in different funny ways. Now the problem that have Another Gay Movie is that i think goes to far thing that American Pie doesn't commits and for worse is not a message of tolerance at all just for the stereotypes. I well known that the Scary Movies count with this silly some time dirty jokes classic of spoof that was developed thanks for Airplane!. The difference is that at least Scary Movie concern is about scary movies. Then we can say that the concern of Another Gay Movie is about gay movies but i don't see it the point. First of all horror genre have different marks through movie history and Scary movie want to spoof all that errors that have in it ilogicity of its plots or its characters gay movies are based in real people who deserves respect as the rest. Now the Scary Movies Althoug there's some better horror spoof like Pandemonium or High Anxiety or even the gay spoof Creatires from the Pink Lagoon could work better as many others spoof scary movies very well Airplane! spoof accident films as The Naked Gun series do with cop movies thats very fine. This movie could spoof the different gay movies but when you see it its clear that don't. Obviously the plot is defined by the gay stereotypes. Sincerely i don't think that is a thing of proud.So Another Gay Movie is a great acceptance comedy just because is like American Pie a straight one. Well then at least for me made something different. The thing is that they picture the gay world most important things are beauty and sex. Unfortunately this is a point that at least this movie get because it's true but is not another reason to laugh. For the rest different exaggerated sexual issues coprophilia and airs of pedophilia and zoophilia are the content of the jokes. And for last the boys dreams in his first times we witness almost everything even just for a note a double penetration. So this is a funny movie anyway the jokes Oh! Come on are just jokes this is not serious film yes of course then the thing of values and respect for difference is just a joke too isn't? Another Gay Movie show to us that. At least is shown to us that gay world then is not so gay as it seems and this could be a good thing just if the film never want to laugh with this.Thats it Another Gay Movie teach me that. Teach us that hot guys like for example that muscle and hot stud called Matthew Rush as i guess a gay porn star that appeared in a lot of Falcon gay porn movies. Damn that was a hot guy dancing in the classic gay music but you hear it talk and it seem to hear that kind of vanity guys who only cares about sex their penis size and how their loved to give and bring at least that was a thing that Another Gay Movie teach me and that is a thing that probably i going to remember anytime i watch one of those Falcon videos.Sorry for the mistakes ... well if there any.".

	schema:reviewBody "Louis de Funs was one of the funniest French comic actors and none of those on the scene today can even compare with him. Many of his films made in the 1960's and 70's are evergreens of French comedy and remain popular even today. Hibernatus is one of the best together with Rabbi Jacob La Grande Vadrouille and Le Corniaud The Sucker. The script lively the film only 78 mins long and Claude Gensac as his long standing ma biche ! is magnificent. The film is basically about De Funes's wife's grandfather who is found frozen in the ice and comes back to life with his family in 1969 ! All surroundings are made to look oldyworldy so that he may think he is still in 1905. All this gives rise to some comic situations where De Funs has to disguise himself first as the grandfather's father and then as suitor to his mother. Without going any more into the detail of the plot one can say that it is highly amusing and entertaining. It has recently been issued on DVD in France with very good picture quality and French Subtitles together with several other famous de Funs comedies such as La Folie des Grandeurs Oscar L'Homme Orchestre ..............".

Many French films of the 1960s would have been boring and unsuccessful without him.The story of this movie was surely not tailormade for Louis. It wouldn't need him Louis is only an additional bonus here. Hibernatus is an absurd little comedy based on a completely crazy idea. A man is found alive in the ice after sixtyfive years and in order to spare him the shock of waking up in a completely different world the whole town is dressed like in 1905. Louis de Funs' family takes over responsibility for the man and of course Louis is the one who suffers because of that.The film is very short and I suppose it shouldn't be longer. It has many funny moments apart from the basically great idea. Playful creative sweet.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1905 an explorer named Paul Fournier is accidentally frozen during an expedition in the North Pole and is kept in the ice for 65 years sleeping over two world wars the nuclear age and the first man on the moon. He's finally defrosted in 1970 in semivegetative state but as his health improves comes the necessity to spare Fournier a shellshocking revelation. So in the name of science and the tremendous implications of hibernation for the space program scientists and the French government agree that no one should inform Fournier about his hibernation. for the moment.Fournier must believe he is still in 1905. But this is where it gets tricky he also happens to be the grandfather of a rich businessman's wife who makes a matter of honor to retrieve her ancestor from the cold claws of science. The woman is Edme Fournier and she's the spouse of Hubert de Tartas and both are played by the eternal couple of French comedy Louis de Funs and Claude Gensac.And by the way this review is dedicated to the memory of one of the most delightful faces of French big screen the eternal 'ma biche' of French cinema Claude Gensac who sadly passed away a few days ago. She often complained about her typecasting she was certainly more than De Funs's wife on the screen she was like a romantic sidekick. And her pairing with De Funs unveiled her catching joviality her soexpressive blue eyes and her wonderful comical timing. She was the perfect straight man to her husband's antics the zen 'yin' to his tempestuous 'yang'. Rest in peace Mrs. Gensac. And now let's get back to the movie. The premise of a man who must think he's still in the Belle Epoque is the stuff funny and intelligent comedies are made on. And just when the Tartas and the physician played by Michael Lonsdale decide to keep Fournier in his family property and with the financial help of the government relook the whole village people and vehicles included into something made in the 1900's this is the kind of speculative creativity that would remind modern audience of The Truman Show although it carries the mark of the director who'd make the original Birdcage a few years later. And there's nothing funnier in a comedy than people pretending to be in a specific situation as long as they play it straight the problem here is that the comical premise of the film is almost spoiled by the predictable tantrums of De Funs.This makes Hibernatus a unique case as it's perhaps the only De Funs movie that could have done better without De Funs I don't mean in terms of boxoffice because the film performed well but the story deserved a more nuanced treatment to be a masterpiece. Instead it's one of the 'lesser' De Funs films. I feel like blaspheming but this is not a comment on his performance but the way it parasites the whole premise. When you have people trying to ease a young man's feeling by making believe he's in 1905 you expect situations that will confront him to the manners and ways of the people of the early 70's you expect contrasts being drawn by tricky conversation and situations. And given how Fournier is young handsome and chivalrous with ladies and marvelously played by Bernard Alane there was a potential overshadowed by De Funs' persona unless the setup started early enough to let the other characters have their share of memorable moments.Indeed I remember when I first saw the film it took a surprisingly long amount of time to get to the setup. Watching it again I thought it took forever to get to the point. There's a whole sequence involving the kidnapping of Fournier's body a helicopter and car chase Edme getting high on oxygen a hiding in a monastery and after many ridiculous and overthetop disguises and sight gags it ends with a touching eye contact between Paul and her granddaughter who conveniently looks like his mother and then he asks his mother to go home then the scientist realizes Fournier will be better off with them. Now why not getting to that part when Hubert and his wife came to the hospital in the first place? That would have been a nice touching moment giving more room for the 1900's plot line far more interesting than the whole kidnapping 'filler' sequence.Instead between Paul's entrance and the final revelation you don't have more than twenty minutes and it's like all the elements of the story are abruptly solved in a messed up climax Hubert's son Didier played by Oliver de Funs doesn't look like he's having fun at all and the only time he laughs is because of some lousy editing during the introductory scene. And the romance between Paul and Didier's sweetheart the daughter of Hubert's business partner is treated in a rather abrupt way. Even the poor Paul Preboist as the goofy butler doesn't get enough screen time to showcase his comedic talent. Still there's one thing left from the film and that belonged to De Funs' greatest moments the revelation about the mother's identity a whole speech culminating with a crazy dance and a repeated line that explains why out of all the female names they chose Edme. This is the film's highlight but it would have been more rewarding had the film been mostly set in the house like Edouard Molinaro's previous success Oscar.Hibernatus had the concept but not the treatment. It also belongs to the kind of film De Funs made before his stroke and that saw the culmination of his crazy mimics. But this is perhaps the only time it undermined a film rather than elevated it. Still it's a classic French comedy in its own right.".

The hibernatus really appears during the second half of the movie and the interview of the actor 30 years later available on the bonus helps soften his character. Moreover De Funes steals the show as always and has the genius to turn bad guys into memorable characters.As I underlined in other reviews a truly good comedy surprises you at each viewing because you can't remember all the funny moments. This is also the case here.In comparison with today movies its short length 80 min is appreciable because it's fast paced and has no time out.".

Soon after the death of Mina the Sewards call her father Dr. Abraham Van Helsing to come to their home. As Lucy falls deeper under the spell of the Count Dr. Van Helsing almost immediately comes to understand that his daughter fell prey to a vampire and discovers the culprit to be none other than the Count himself.

	schema:reviewBody "For years I've listened to horror fans talk trash about the 1979 Dracula. It's not faithful to the book they'd complain it's not scary it's only made for the sake of middleaged ladies who fancy Frank Langella etc. etc.Well I'm happy to report that the horror fans are way off base this time. This Dracula is a classy creepy and sometimes downright exciting production. Sure the script doesn't follow the events of the book exactly  the whole thing takes place in England!  but it makes the most of its limitations so to speak.Langella makes a very classy Dracula. He apparently refused to wear fangs or demon eyes for the role focusing instead on making the count more human  not to mention arrogant intelligent and I suppose sexy for me and other guy viewers though the eye candy in this movie is Kate Nelligan. Perhaps Langella is a little too normal and his big hair is slightly amusing but on the whole I think he plays the role with dignity inhabiting Dracula in a far more convincing way than the likes of Gary Oldman.The rest of the cast is pretty good too. Nelligan makes a lovely capable heroine and Trevor Eve is an OK if underused Jonathan Harker. Laurence Olivier's Van Helsing is a lot better than most people say he is  he comes across as smart brave and an overall worthy opponent for Dracula. Reviewers tend to mock his Dutch accent but I don't get too wrapped up in stuff like that it sounds fine to me. I certainly think the cast here is much better than the parade of wooden actors and crazy hams in the Coppola version.I like the production values of this film too. The special effects are mostly photographic tricks but they look cool and they aren't overbearing like modern CGI effects. The sets and locations are attractive though the designers went a bit overboard with the Gothic ruin of Carfax Abbey probably because they wanted to make it a substitute for the absent Castle Dracula. And of course the eerie John Williams score is a treat and rightly praised by most critics.Another plus is that the movie features a number of very powerful scenes  I love Dracula's confrontation with Van Helsing in the study and the terrifying moment when Van Helsing encounters his vampire daughter in the mine shaft. Creepy stuff no wonder this movie freaked me out when I was a kid! On the downside I found Dr. Seward as played by Donald Pleasence slightly too grotesque and lame to be believed. And as usual for these Dracula adaptations Renfield seemed borderline extraneous. The plotting flakes apart a bit at the end too with the car chase scene coming across as silly  and what exactly does the final image in the film mean? It's slightly too enigmatic for my tastes. I am supposed to be rooting for Dracula to survive or something?Still this is one of the better Draculas. The 1977 BBC version is more faithful and probably better. But this is arguably the best adaptation of the story to come out of Hollywood.".

The fine supporting cast includes Trevor Eve Donald Pleasence and a wealth of familiar British character actors Tony Haygarth Teddy Turner Sylvester McCoy etc. alongside Canadian actress Kate Nelligan giving a finelytuned performance as a potential bride of Dracula.

	schema:reviewBody "It is surprising to me that given the popular and critical praise so many mediocre vampire movies have received this includes the badly dated Hammer flicks this movie is often dismissed as minor and forgettable. While it is true that the definitive version is still Coppola's 1992 film this overlooked gem deserves much more attention and praise than it currently gets.It was possibly the first vampire movie to play up the romantic and sexual implications of the vampire legend while at the same time remaining faithful to the underlying idea of Stoker's novel that is a fight between good and evil. It is worth pointing out that the film depicts count Dracula as a good looking seductive and charming aristocrat rather than an impulsive bloodthirsty creature. He is a broody lonely character seeking for a female partner with whom share his everlasting loneliness something he seems to find in the form of Lucy Seward an independent and strongwilled Victorian lady.But the fact that this Dracula has a romantic strain to him does not conceal his ultimately evil nature. He consciously seduces and attacks ill defenseless Mina just for the excitement of it. When Dr Van Helsing meets her at the graveyard galleries she is no longer that frail but charming girl but a deathlypaleputrid disgusting figure. That is what Dracula's hobby implies.Badham does an excellent job. He effectively uses Gothic imagery and low key lightning to create an eerie and slightly surreal atmosphere.But what really stands out in this version is the cast. Everyone fits their role perfectly.Langella plays a seductive count. Olivierinspired by Cushing's performance in 1958 Dracula puts in a riveting performance as a frail tortured Van Helsing with an emotional stake in the story pun intended. Kate Nelligan a fine Canadian supporting actressalso starring in Eye of the Needle delivers a fresh performance. Even Harker's character  which is usually the main casting weakness when it comes to Dracula movies is quite well handled here played by an actor with the right appearance.There are minor flaws the most important of them being a lack of screen time devoted to the romance and a muddled color scheme but this film is nevertheless worth a look an engaging retelling of the classic horror tale with a poetic broody edge to it.".

Also the character of Renfield is much more of a sympathetic creature in this version. This production as was the 1931 Universal version was taken by the Hamilton dean play with quite a few script additions. And I agree with the young woman who said that she could understand how this Dracula with his oozing sensuality could so easily draw women to him. Of all the screen Draculas Langella is the one with the most sex appeal. Finally to round out the charms of this film is the fantastic sound score created by John Williams.

But Frank Langella's exquisite performance was a new twist on the horrid vengeful bloodsucker from the classic Stoker novel.For over two decades women have found Langella's portrayal to be the most erotic sexy and desirable by comparison because of his physique masculinity voice and natural charisma. In fact to me  Frank Langella ISWAS Dracula not just an actor who played the role.But I wholly credit the film makers for opting to steer THIS film into a more romantic passionate sexual approach. With the dozens of DRACULA films producedthe flavor does begin to stagnate. After all how many other Dracula films have flopped? Not just due to the poor casting bad direction or writing either. A film goer can only stand to see exact or similar performances for so longremember the FRIDAY THE 13TH series?Also the special effects used in this film were very impressive for 1979. Most of the Draculawolf morph scenes were pulled off convincing as was the Draculabat changes during the VANHELSING  HARKER  DRACULA scene at Carfax Abbey. I was duly impressed by the 'invisible man' door opening effect after Lucy's seduction when DRACULA pays VANHELSING a surprise visit ...I did not hear you come in Count...In addition Frank Langella's natural astigmatism or dancing eyes only completed an intensifying dramatic effect that no effort of modern technology could possibly recreate.MOVING ON TO THE FILM  what woman doesn't dream of being kissed as Dracula kisses Lucy during you know what scene I'm talking about. At first they are standing atop the balcony commenting about the children of the night. Well Dracula would have swept me off my feet too! And then later in the bedroom scene when Dracula seduces Lucywell what more can I say?Stepping backward if you please to the intermediate Seward Dinner' following the opening scene when Count Dracula finally makes his first bold appearance. I felt as though I were actually watching the drama unfold on a live stage in front of me!Yes Hollywood has been producing DRACULA films for nearly a century. However the film producers really put the monster in a whole new more human perspective  as only Frank Langella could do  with perfection.In fact it was Langella's stunning OffBroadway performance that sparked the film maker's idea to adapt this script to the big screen.Alongside a stellar cast of fine performances from Nelligan and veterans Olivier and Sutherland this film deeply portrays DRACULA at first as an alluring romantic sexy suave Monarch. But then gradually untwists to reveal the true lusting hideous destructive 'creature of the night'.That's my say for nowPeanut".

However the film producers really put the monster in a whole new more human perspective  as only Frank Langella could do  with perfection.In fact it was Langella's stunning OffBroadway performance that sparked the film maker's idea to adapt this script to the big screen.Alongside a stellar cast of fine performances from Nelligan and veterans Olivier and Sutherland this film deeply portrays DRACULA at first as an alluring romantic sexy suave Monarch. But then gradually untwists to reveal the true lusting hideous destructive 'creature of the night'.That's my say for nowPeanut";

	schema:headline " A Gothic masterpiece. The quintessential vampire movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "After so many years Lugosi's performance of Dracula wilts into camp and the overblown Coppola version while visually stimulating comes across as so much hyperbole. Oldman was brilliant but a few of his lines were poorly delivered almost laughably so.But Langella was the master of all vampires. His performance reels with sexual presence and a charm and sophistication that renders all other Dracula movies null and void. And why not? He had countless performances on Broadway to perfect his character and perfect it he did. He insisted on touches such as never wearing fangs or never appearing with blood on his face that added class to the vampire legend and places this version a cut above the rest.Kate Nelligan Prince of Tides was so young and beautiful then and it was easy to believe that she could inspire a love that could transcend death and time. Olivier was already a ghost and many of the scenes that involved activity no more strenuous than walking actually had to be shot with a stand in. It is rumored that Sir Larry's performance was so frail that impressionist Rich Little actually had to be called in to dub some of Olivier's lines as he had done for David Niven in his final Pink Panther film because the originals were virtually unintelligible given the poor health of the actors. The brooding and regal score by John Williams drives the movie quite nicely. The film was edited by John Bloom who a couple of years later would edit The French Lieutenant's Woman with a similar feel and shot by Gil Taylor who shot among other greats the original Star Wars. Stoker would have been proud of the final result particularly so with Langella's masterful and groundbreaking performance that launched a career. Dracula is a Gothic masterpiece that has never been given its due.In 2004 director Badham decided to release a version in which the color had been drained from the movie in much the same way as its central character drained color blood and life from his victims perhaps an intentional comparison. The making of featurette is delightful and producer Mirisch's hilarious tongue in cheek observation of the holy water effect has already been misquoted by earnest IMDb reviewers. The remake is nice but it was gilding the lily. And although the film was indeed improved by this modification it had already surpassed any of its would be peers and remains the quintessential vampire movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure why but when people discuss Dracula films Frank Langella is often looked over. He's my personal favorite Dracula to me at least he captures everything that Dracula is supposed to be. In the book he doesn't have an accent he's just a charming gentleman who happens to be a monster that will turn on you and destroy anything that will get in his path of what he wants. So what makes this Dracula so different from the previous two? The first Dracula played by Bela was suave but he was bent on making others into his slave. The second Dracula played by Christopher Lee was charming but a true monster in every sense of the word as well as a sexual predator. Frank Langella brings class charm chills and oozes sex appeal. He's the first real romantic Dracula who doesn't just bite the cutest girl next to him but actually falls in love with someone. It's one of the rare times where we look at Dracula not just as a monster but that he was human once and he still has emotions perhaps never lost from his mortal life. Good actors and a chilling atmosphere gives this Dracula something special and that should be looked at more often.Count Dracula arrives from Transylvania to England one night through ship. Mina Van Helsing who is visiting her friend Lucy Seward discovers Dracula's body after his ship has run aground. After praising her as his Savior the Count visits Mina and her friends at the household of Lucy's father Dr. Jack Seward whose mansion also serves as the local asylum. At dinner he proves to be a charming guest and leaves a strong impression on the hosts Lucy especially. Less charmed by this handsome Romanian count is Jonathan Harker Lucy's fianc. Dracula later reveals his true nature as he descends upon Mina to drink her blood. The following morning Lucy finds Mina awake in bed struggling for breath. At a loss for the cause of death Dr. Seward calls for Mina's father Professor Abraham Van Helsing. Van Helsing suspects what might have killed his daughter a vampire. Seward and Van Helsing investigate their suspicions and discover a makeshift tunnel within Mina's coffin which leads to the local mines. It is there that they encounter the ghastly form of an undead Mina and it is up to a distraught Van Helsing to destroy what remains of his own daughter. Lucy meanwhile has been summoned to Carfax Abbey Dracula's new home and soon she reveals herself to be in love with this foreign prince and openly offers herself to him as his bride. Now the men are determined to save her from Dracula before losing her forever like Mina.My one complaint about the film is that it is dated with the weird James Bond like style of the love scene between Lucy and Dracula. It's very odd and not well placed with the style of the film. Lucy and Mina's names being switched didn't bother me at all they're still part of the story. Honestly I gave up a Dracula movie being 100 faithful to the novel years ago it's just not going to happen at least for a while. Dracula does not have fangs in this film but Frank's performance is still very chilling and hypnotic. Mina as a vampire was just horrifying and gave me nightmares as a child. While the film could be considered slow paced I still love this movie. I was watching the making of this film and the director mentioned how Dracula wasn't taken so seriously because that year Love at first Bite was also released a clever parody on Dracula that I also happen to love but that's sad that this Dracula has always been over looked. It's a very good movie and incredibly under rated. Come on we have Frank Langella Laurence Olivier and Donald Pleasence you can't do any better than that.910".

	schema:reviewBody "Now I'm going to forward a controversial comment. This is the BEST adaptation of Dracula yet seen and miles better than Coppola's version.I liked this adaptation because it was a subtle take on the old legend needing neither the overblown pretension of Coppola's rather lurid and purpleprosy presentation nor the schlocky elements of the Hammer versions as good as they are.Frank Langella really was the definitive Count. He carried the role off with charm and calculation making him far more rounded a character than Oldman did but maybe not with the poignancy. What makes the difference though is that Langella gets firstclass backup while with the exception of Anthony Hopkins Oldman was left on his own by the woodenly gruesome performances of the supporting cast Wynona Ryder and especially Keanu Reeves were the chief culprits here. Kate Nelligan Sir Larry and Donald Pleasance were in fine form and Trevor Eve made more of the Jonathan Harker character than Reeves ever could. Jan Francis made a believably frail Mina.What really makes this film so good though is the superbly Gothic atmosphere. The set for the Count's castle was suitably creepy and the cinematography added to the feel of the period. Technically Badham's version shows how much has now been lost by the reliance on CGI and digital addons.That this Dracula takes it's cue from the stage adaptation rather than Stoker's original book adds a welcome element of variety. So what if it's not faithful? Does it matter? Very few films these days have this level of class and genuine skill injected into them. John Badham's version has been criminally underrated for years and slagged off by far too many illinformed pedants. Judge for yourself. Maybe you will disagree about which adaptation is best but  pound to a penny you won't regret watching it.".

	schema:headline " Not for those seeking the sameold same old.";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me ramble a bit here Personally I'm a bit offended when I hear people describe this version of Dracula as nothing more than an on screen Harlequin romance. One wonders if the individual speaking those words has ever read one of those trashy novels.What the director manages in this movie is to present us with instead of a flat out gory horror movie a psychological look into what is truly horrible. Here we have for all intents and purposes an alien the last of his kind so he says desperately clinging to life. The viewer is intended to empathize with him.Even in his cool refined gentlemanly state there is a sense of Dracula's urgency. He has to breed offspring which if you read preStoker actual vampire lore is mentioned and common not only could vampires have sex and reproduce they could also reproduce with humans. In fact one of the ways a male vampire could be spotted to be such would be opening the coffin and finding the corpse sprouting a chubby. in whatever manner he can he has to. His people are gone. In a way this makes the human characters in the story more horrible than Dracula it would be akin to the last tiger being hunted down for being a tiger and desperately attempting to make other tigers.It is this predatory vitality that Langella communicates beautifully in this film. All the other male characters are ineffectual aged insane or duplicitous Harker though they are not played badly Dracula himself stands as sort of a dark mirror of them all and yet with virtues none of the other males possess. In a way the death of Dracula at the end is the death of the primal man. All that is left in the wake is the modern man the duplicitous and shallow Harker... and the hope of the primal man's return the cape floating away on the wind.Lucy is right Dracula is the saddest and kindest of all the men there. He could have murdered everyone and taken what he wanted he demonstrates such powers that I can believe him to be completely able to do such a thing. He can slaughter an entire ship's crew of healthy strapping men how are lunatics two old doctors and a solicitor going to stand up to him if he really wanted to kill them? He's already been invited he could have destroyed them all at any conceivable time... but he did not. He was a gentleman. It is this nobility which none of the men including Van Helsing remember the line about sacrilege? possess that ends up destroying him. He gives them all chances to look the other way he does not want to hurt them. In fact the times Dracula kills in this movie are few. He kills to preserve his own existence which all of us would do to feed which we all again do even vegetarians to change enabling procreation also important and he kills those who betray him and endanger him Renfield the driver of the cart who was trying to slow the horses.No I think the reason this selection doesn't appeal to most isn't the romance though that is what's usually blamed  it is the uncomfortable feeling put forth by the instances I described above that Humanity holds the real monsters for various reasons.And that brings us to Mina. Mina was not crazy and monstrous because she was a vampire. Nor was she crazed because she was already insane before being tainted like Renfield. Lucy and Dracula also prove to us that it is quite easy to be sane and be a vampire. Mina at least in this version appears to be insane because she awoke inside a coffin in the dark and had to claw her way out. Anyone who has ever read an account of being entombed alive and then having to dig one's way out knows that this can and does drive people to madness. How much worse would it be to suddenly discover on top of that that you are no longer human? As far as her reflecting in water vampires DO reflect in water according to folklore. They do not reflect in mirrors because once upon a time mirrors were actually silvered a mixture of mercury and silver if I remember correctly and silver and undead do not mix well. The double destruction stake to paralyze then heart removal is also mentioned in folklore and is not unusual in the slightest.In all I believe this needs to be taken as a psychological piece of social commentary more than a romance or a true adaptation of Stoker's work even then that's up for grabs. I've read the book myself many times and my interpretation of it is quite different than what would be expected as 'standard'.

	onyx:emotionText "Let me ramble a bit here Personally I'm a bit offended when I hear people describe this version of Dracula as nothing more than an on screen Harlequin romance. One wonders if the individual speaking those words has ever read one of those trashy novels.What the director manages in this movie is to present us with instead of a flat out gory horror movie a psychological look into what is truly horrible. Here we have for all intents and purposes an alien the last of his kind so he says desperately clinging to life. The viewer is intended to empathize with him.Even in his cool refined gentlemanly state there is a sense of Dracula's urgency. He has to breed offspring which if you read preStoker actual vampire lore is mentioned and common not only could vampires have sex and reproduce they could also reproduce with humans. In fact one of the ways a male vampire could be spotted to be such would be opening the coffin and finding the corpse sprouting a chubby. in whatever manner he can he has to. His people are gone. In a way this makes the human characters in the story more horrible than Dracula it would be akin to the last tiger being hunted down for being a tiger and desperately attempting to make other tigers.It is this predatory vitality that Langella communicates beautifully in this film. All the other male characters are ineffectual aged insane or duplicitous Harker though they are not played badly Dracula himself stands as sort of a dark mirror of them all and yet with virtues none of the other males possess. In a way the death of Dracula at the end is the death of the primal man. All that is left in the wake is the modern man the duplicitous and shallow Harker... and the hope of the primal man's return the cape floating away on the wind.Lucy is right Dracula is the saddest and kindest of all the men there. He could have murdered everyone and taken what he wanted he demonstrates such powers that I can believe him to be completely able to do such a thing. He can slaughter an entire ship's crew of healthy strapping men how are lunatics two old doctors and a solicitor going to stand up to him if he really wanted to kill them? He's already been invited he could have destroyed them all at any conceivable time... but he did not. He was a gentleman. It is this nobility which none of the men including Van Helsing remember the line about sacrilege? possess that ends up destroying him. He gives them all chances to look the other way he does not want to hurt them. In fact the times Dracula kills in this movie are few. He kills to preserve his own existence which all of us would do to feed which we all again do even vegetarians to change enabling procreation also important and he kills those who betray him and endanger him Renfield the driver of the cart who was trying to slow the horses.No I think the reason this selection doesn't appeal to most isn't the romance though that is what's usually blamed  it is the uncomfortable feeling put forth by the instances I described above that Humanity holds the real monsters for various reasons.And that brings us to Mina. Mina was not crazy and monstrous because she was a vampire. Nor was she crazed because she was already insane before being tainted like Renfield. Lucy and Dracula also prove to us that it is quite easy to be sane and be a vampire. Mina at least in this version appears to be insane because she awoke inside a coffin in the dark and had to claw her way out. Anyone who has ever read an account of being entombed alive and then having to dig one's way out knows that this can and does drive people to madness. How much worse would it be to suddenly discover on top of that that you are no longer human? As far as her reflecting in water vampires DO reflect in water according to folklore. They do not reflect in mirrors because once upon a time mirrors were actually silvered a mixture of mercury and silver if I remember correctly and silver and undead do not mix well. The double destruction stake to paralyze then heart removal is also mentioned in folklore and is not unusual in the slightest.In all I believe this needs to be taken as a psychological piece of social commentary more than a romance or a true adaptation of Stoker's work even then that's up for grabs. I've read the book myself many times and my interpretation of it is quite different than what would be expected as 'standard'. To call it a Harlequin Romance seems a blanket statement not at all suited for the overall depth of the piece it is a work of horror but I believe it is the horror for mankind's destruction of its own sense of mystery rather than the campy gore slash fest normally associated with that title. I highly recommend it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Fresh from directing Saturday Night Fever John Badham here tries to give the Dracula story a stylish makeover. However in taking this fantastic tale of terror and smearing it with romance elegance and charm Badham has stripped the concept of its horror and its spooky atmosphere. Of all the Dracula films ever made this one might well have the best photography but it also has probably the worst chill factor. I've seen U rated movies scarier than this. That probably explains why the film divides critics so much  there are those who rate it highly because of its sumptuous style while others come away bitterly disappointed as a result of its total disregard for the horror side of the story. I must admit I'm not a great fan of this version  I'm a contentoverstyle man and this one just doesn't deliver for me.There's little point going into detail about the plot. Bram Stoker's story has been read and dramatised so many times that everyone knows how it goes. However this version makes some changes to the source novel it is based actually on a stage play by Balderston and Deane. For instance Van Helsing is not merely a vampire expert he is also the father of one of Dracula's earliest victims. Dracula himself is a sexy charming societygentleman as opposed to a reclusive mysterious and creepy figure. These little changes freshen up the plot a little but are not in any other way beneficial to the film.Performancewise the film is variable. Frank Langella plays Dracula quite well he'd had plenty of practise after performing the role for months on Broadway Donald Pleasance is great as Dr. Seward Trevor Eve seems stiff and unconvincing as Jonathan Harker and Laurence Olivier overacts hideously as Van Helsing. At this point of his career Olivier was going through a phase of uncontrolled hammy displays see The Betsy Inchon The Jazz Singer and Clash of the Titans to see what I mean. One has to wonder if someone a little more restrained  say John Mills or James Mason  might have made a better Van Helsing in 1979. There's great cinematography by Gilbert Taylor making this a film most assuredly intended for the wide screen and John Williams adds another memorable score to his list of impeccable film music from the '70s.Dracula is an OK film loved by some detested by others but it really needed more attention to the frightening aspects. After all a greatlooking horror film is rather a pointless thing if it lacks the ability to spook your mind or jolt you out of your seat.".

Olivier is over the top as Dracula's virtuous enemy. I am not sure this was the author's intention but it is a powerful tool when an actor like Olivier is introduced in the 2nd half. Comic relief is well placed. Donald Pleasence is always eating.These are two of the greatest things I can say about this masterpiece. 1 The movie is terrifying without a huge amount of blood or effects. Even the characters do not raise their voices much. BUT the intensity of the situations and dialogues is what can strike fear into us. 2 Like the heroes in Charles Dickens' books Olivier Eve and Pleasence are NOT supermen. They are regular people who rise to face and defeat an evil presence in their setting. The end is done with superb skill. The conversations stop and the final fight begins. Even the symphony music for the end credits seems to flatter this end well. This is one of those rare movies that I CAN NOT say enough good things about.

	schema:headline " A dark sensual and brilliant version of a horror classic";
	schema:reviewBody "I love Bram Stoker's Dracula. Not only is it one of my favourite books its one of the few classic horror novels that remains both gripping and scary. Over the years it has been adapted more times directly or indirectly than pretty much any other book and I've seen most of them from the fantastic Herzog's Nosferatu to the good but flawed Coppolas version the bloodily entertaining most of Hammer's efforts and the shockingly bad Blood for Dracula Dracula 2000 and Blade Trinity are the standouts here. In terms of my personal preference I think Herzog's version of Nosferatu is my favourite I far prefer it to the original while my favourite Count is Christopher Lee.It seems weird then that I've never seen this film though that probably can be attributed to both the fact that it's hardly ever shown on TV and the fact that reviews tend to emphasise the romantic aspects of the film making it sound sufficiently like an Anne Rice novel for me to have very little interest in it. Actually this appraisal is quite quite wrong as Badham's film is as much about dark Gothic horror as it is about sex much as Stoker's original novel is.In fact this is a very dark and fullblooded approach to the much recounted tale which strips down the novel to its iconic bits then proceeds like a blooddrinking throattearing juggernaut to its violent conclusion. Opening with the shipwreck of the Demeter in Whitby sailors ripped to pieces by a mysterious evil as the storm lashes against them inmates of Dr Seward's asylum screaming like wild animals and the sickly Mina unaccountably swapped for Lucy discovers a lone survivor the rakish Count Dracula on the beach. After recovering the Count kills Mina and then turns his attention to corrupting Lucy instead...The film is romantic but it is foremost a Gothic piece a dark twisted tale in which love and death are intertwined as much a kind of Wuthering Heights as a Dracula. Moments of utmost grisly horror are dotted throughout particularly when the vampire hunters encounter the hideous creature that Mina has become in the caves beneath the graveyard or the final battle with the count.It should be noted that the set design direction and cinematography are excellent from the cobweb caked ruins of Dracula's castle to the nightmare of Seward's asylum Badham creates a nightmarish almost Dickensian Victorian setting which utilises some beautiful Cornish coastal landscape. slightly puzzling to be honest as its supposed to be Whitby and looks absolutely nothing like it. I'm curious why they didn't just shoot it in Whitby especially as it is very proud of its Dracula connection and still looks creepy and Victorian. The cinematography is great as well with some really lush Technicolour scenes that recall Terence Fisher's work for Hammer which I would argue is a clear aesthetic influence but because of the superior script and acting it all comes off much better.There are some liberties taken with the novel such as confining the action to Whitby and trimming the number of characters but that doesn't really matter as all the important elements are there and the tone of the original work is totally nailed with the contrasting Freudian and Jungian interpretations of Dracula as both a symbol of sex and death and a symbol of rebirth given full development and exploration by the ambitious script.The cast is also very good Langella portrays the count as a kind of rakish figure who can alternate between sexy and sinister and probably is the best Dracula since Lee while he is offered excellent support by Donald Pleasance as an oddball Dr Seward Tony Haygarth as a brutish Renfield and Trevor Eve as an exasperated Jonathan Harker. Oddly the weakest link in the cast is Olivier as Van Helsing who puts on a stupid accent and hams it up atrociously.Overall though this is a terrific version of the oft recounted tale suffusing rich Gothic imagery with a dark sensuality. Nosferatu aside this is certainly the best adaptation of Dracula that I have seen.".

	schema:headline " This one is called the romanticized version but seemed horror at its core";
	schema:reviewBody "I had never seen this version of Dracula but I had heard things about it. Apparently I still haven't seen the version most people remember as it was filmed in more vibrant colors than what I had gotten with my DVD that I happened to stumble upon and decided to buy. This version of Dracula I rather enjoyed more so than the 1992 version I liked that one too. This one was said to be the more romanticized Dracula but I think the 92 version was the one that was a bit too romantic. Here people's throats get ripped out right from the get go and there are cool scenes of undead creatures residing under the cemetery. Sure Frank Langella's Dracula is a bit of a smooth talker but at his core is a darkness and arrogance that feels that the men have no power to stop him as he takes the women from their lives and threatens to end their pitiful existence. There are things that are changed from the novel but I do not find a problem with that in fact it made for a surprise as I thought Mina was going to be the object of Dracula's desire. This one did Van Helsing a bit differently too as the cast of this one did a great job for the most part.The story has a ship trying to get rid of one of its boxes of cargo. Surprise it gets stuck and one of the crew's throat is ripped out. The residents of a mental asylum are restless and Mina goes out and finds a man who has seemingly survived a terrible boat crash. Seems his name is Count Dracula and he is soon invited to dine at the doctor in charge of the mental asylum Seward. He arrives and seems very polite and charming and he is not there five minutes before putting the moves on both ladies present. There is something dark about him and why try to hide it he is going to try to have some blood.The cast sets this Dracula apart as Frank Langella does a great job as the count though Christopher Lee is my favorite all time Dracula. He was a monster plain and simple while in this one he is a charmer with a darkness about him. I read where Langella's eyes have a hard time focusing and in scenes I saw them moving but I did not know of this condition so I just assumed he was doing it purposely as it actually made his stare more unsettling. Laurence Olivier plays Van Helsing and he is rather good like Cushing best but I like how he was presented here. He was a father who had lost his daughter and he wanted his revenge. They did a much better job making he and Dracula enemies than they did in the 92 version. However I thought Donald Pleasence as Doctor Jack Seward was a more interesting character than Van Helsing. a bit of an odd man who was very helpful as he saved Van Helsing and Johnathon Harker! I read where he turned down the role of Van Helsing because he felt it was too close to Dr. Loomis but the character he did choose ran the mental institution. Johnathon Harker was okay they usually miscast the character and here is no exception. I did not think he did as bad as others do but he was a bit weak. The two girls were okay too neither really exploding on screen though.So all in all a rather good retelling of the Dracula story. Granted it does deviate from the book and while I wish they had just gone all out and made Dracula the monster he is I still found this portrayal interesting. The movie ends on an ambiguous note that could have lead to a sequel which never occurred which is probably for the best as it is not too long after this film that Langella kind of aged quickly. Who knows? Perhaps he was Dracula and the sun he was exposed to at the end aged him quickly or something. Seriously I had never seen Langella look this young on screen and I had seen him in movies from the 80's! All in all a rather good Dracula film that you can really sink your teeth into...and yes I went there!".

	schema:headline " The Romantic Dracula";
	schema:reviewBody "I wanted to restore the character as a pure romantic dignified and elegant man one who really does want to find one special woman. And as most women want to find one special man... if you're lucky enough ever to have that in your life you realize how much better it is than anything else.  Frank LangellaThat essentially is the crux of this adaptation of Dracula. No it is not entirely accurate to the book. It is not even somewhat accurate to the book. It barely resembles the book except in the names of the characters and even those have been changed around and the fact that the Count is in fact a vampire. And don't get me wrong I love the book for its subtleties and for providing a fascinating glimpse into a Victorian mindset through its symbolism but only one Dracula movie stands out for me and this is it. It is a shame in some regards that the film has become dated that it was moved into the Edwardian era instead of remaining Victorian and did not land a bigger budget because frankly without some of the cheesy special effects and 70's style of film making it would improve greatly. I am well aware of its faults even known to make intentional fun at them but it's true I simply love it.Prior to taking on this role Langella was performing the same character on stage on Broadway and creating a sensation. Women simply loved him. I actually knew a woman who used to work in the theater and she said she has never seen such a reaction in a female audience before or since those performances. Langella had such tremendous stage presence that most of the women in the audience were madly in love with him before the end of the first act. The movie gives us a taste of this because Langella embodies something very few men possess  natural sensuality. It's never forced it's never aggressive it's never overbearing or overtly sexual it's demure eroticism underneath a cravat. He is one of the most elegant men I have ever seen the kind where you are consciously aware of him in a room even if he is not the central focus of the camera. It is Langella that makes the film  without him for all intensive purposes it would be rubbish a forgettable foray into the lackluster productions that marked the latter half of the 1970's.Langella approached the project differently from any actor before or since  he wanted to make the Count a lonely individual who arrives in England suspecting nothing will change that he will remain indifferent and amused by mere mortals and instead is powerfully drawn to a woman. It is love that ensnares him and makes him careless while at the same time Lucy discovers an intensity a gentlemanly quality a charm in him that is absent from her aggressive suitor. There's no sensitivity in Jonathan no lingering caresses which is not the case with Dracula. The Count makes it all about her and that makes all the difference.It's an unusual film in certain regards since it does make the audience naturally side with him but also does not shy away from enforcing the view that Dracula is indeed evil. He is responsible for death and insanity. He does represent sin and temptation but at the same time when his end comes about we are sad. We are angry. We do not want to see him suffer like that. Not that beautiful charming mildmannered Count who well just has this tiny flaw of being a vampire. It's forgivable... isn't it? What I like about this film is that it intentionally appeals to women by respecting their boundaries. It's tasteful. There is a little bit of gore true but the overall approach is unique and tinged with romanticism. Dracula never reveals fangs. He never has blood on his mouth. The love scene is not explicit and contains nothing to detract from its emotional connection. I saw it for the first time at age seventeen and have seen it hundreds of times in the years since. It is not an awardwinning film but it doesn't have to be it makes me delightfully happy and that's all that matters.".

One problem for me as with ConanDoyle's Hound of the Baskervilles is that the book's plot which was perfectly OK was messed around with. I've never seen Dracula or The Hound done with integrity on the screen. Why change names? Why expand the plot to include peripheral characters? While Frank Langella's performance is wonderful they had to do it again. They had to mess with the women. They did away with all kinds of elements. I know it's based on a state play I actually saw the Broadway production but why is there a need to mess with success. Of course since I loved many of the others I forgive them for this. I'm hoping that before I'm gone someone will take on the task of a reasonable adaptation of Stoker's book. The Gary Oldman had the title but once again didn't follow through.".

	schema:headline " Mike Leigh turns the trivial into the truly tragic";
	schema:reviewBody "Mike Leigh's latest film Another Year follows the story of a happily married couple approaching their retirement years. Their warm relationship offers them security as the the film progresses. Their friends and family by contrast all struggle to some extent with unhappiness and a sense that their best years may be behind them.The film is a story of ageing the small events that can make life either comforting or unbearable and the refuge that companionship can offer.Rut Sheen's role as Gerri is superb. Her open welcoming face invites her friend and colleague Mary played by Lesley Manville to open up to her about her drunken fears of where her life is leading. Jim Broadbent's Tom is charming and selfeffacing confident in his own happiness yet nonplussed at the failure of his friend Ken  Peter Wight  to come to terms with growing old.The film dwells on the small predominantly nonverbal signals that reveal emotional and social insecurity. Leigh's direction reminds us that the sharpest insights into character lie in moments where we think we at our most concealed. Faces betray what we wish were kept private  at moments where verbal communication fails physical expression lights up hidden fears passions failings and desires.Leigh treats all his characters with a certain dignity  whilst there are moments where we are encouraged to laugh at their social inadequacies for the most part we suffer along with them knowing that their experiences are all too near reality to take lightly. We encourage Tom and Gerri to keep supporting their despairing friends yet knowing at the same time that their married happiness can only serve to mock their friends' lonely lives further. The four strictly partitioned seasons of the film point towards a growing anxiety that it may in fact be too late for these lost characters. The cyclical nature of the structure suggests that there is no real remedy for those left unloved and lonely at the film's conclusion.From the opening scene where a woman silently struggles to recollect the happiest moment in her life to the point when the dialogue slowly fades away to leave Mary isolated and forlorn we cannot help but be both enchanted and dismayed by the emotional honesty of Mike Leigh's characters. This is what sets out the director as a truly gifted artist  his ability to heighten the routine into the dramatic and to make the trivial truly tragic.".

	schema:headline " Another existentialist classic by Mike Leigh";
	schema:reviewBody "Tom and Gerri Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen the couple at the centre of Mike Leigh's latest existential piece couldn't be more unlike the cartoon characters who share their names. Together for several decades their love for each other has only grown. I wouldn't complain if my marriage looked like theirs when I'm in my 50s.When he isn't working as a geologist and she isn't counselling people they spend their time providing solace to those who need it  Ken Peter Wight a straighttalking John Smithsdrinking Yorkshireman Ronnie David Bradley Tom's laconic brother whose wife has just died and most of all Mary Lesley Manville a jittery colleague of Gerri's in the middle of a midlife crisis. It is Mary who dominates the film and who most elicits our empathy. She is without love and possibly even without the hope of love. It is genuinely painful to see her disintegrate scene by scene. As another year in Tom and Gerri's life unfolds we see nothing particularly fascinating happen. They tend to their allotment they invite people to their house for food and company and they reminisce about their experiences. Nothing could be more trivial right? Wrong. This film is about growing old and making the right choices as one gets to old age. Above all it's about recognising that happiness is less a right than an aspiration.The word 'integrity' comes to mind when I think of Mike Leigh. Who else could convince actors to sign up to films where there was no script to begin with? Throughout his career he has eschewed the Hollywood system and has done things his own way 'Given the choice of Hollywood or poking steel pins in my eyes I'd prefer steel pins'. An audience member expostulated at the end 'That wasn't very uplifting'. She's correct but Leigh doesn't offer folly or fantasy. He's a truthseeking social observer and commentator. What's also appealing about Leigh is that he doesn't spoonfeed his audience. His films compel the watcher to debate what they have seen and draw their own conclusions. Why should films give us answers? I was moved by this film like no other in recent memory. One moment I was laughing uncontrollably the next I was holding back tears. The film emphasises a sad fact for some people things don't always go according to plan. Sometimes we're just plain unlucky. And that's life.www.scottishreview.net".

Thank God for films which refuse to pander to us while we munch expectantly on our popcorn.This film does NOT offer an uplifting story or even a plot or special effects or a happy ending. Follow the signs to Men In Black instead. Another Year is slow it's sad even depressing and it reeks of personal desperation. But I think it is a hugely underrated gem of a film... if you're prepared to put in the work. It is simultaneously a celebration of fine acting craft and a test of the audience's interpretative skill.It's difficult to think of a more astonishing performance than Lesley Manville as Mary hers is a slow  excruciating descent from navet  painful insecurity to abject exhausted desolation from which we don't expect her to return no matter how much we hope that she will. Her final scene is as haunting and heartbreaking as any which you're likely to see. We know that her hell is probably of her own doing but it doesn't prevent our pity of her.The central characters Tom  Gerri are generally considered happy and towards whom unfulfilled family and friends gravitate as if Tom  Gerri's union was life's ideal for happiness. However this 'ideal' is shown up by the absence of any obvious elation joy or excitement in Tom  Gerri 's lives and we are similarly responsive to their characters we neither like nor dislike them because their happiness seems attractive to others only as a foil to risky failure not as something to genuinely aspire to. I think Mike Leigh presents us with several questions and human hypocrisies Mary's disgust at fellow lost soul Ken is surely a subconscious terror of her own similar failures and Gerri's general benevolence towards longtime friend Mary is exposed as mockery and patronisation when she's in private. Had Mary's  Ken's situations been rescued by the arrival of their respective loves on white horses we may well have been celebrating the exhilaration of love discovered after life's tumultuous rollercoaster. Then the colourless contentment  smugness which Tom  Gerri offer up as life's nirvana would've been relegated to lastresort mediocrity.".

The latter comment may prove hard to understand if you're not British and that's just like the film Marmite is a British spread made from yeast extract with a loveitorhateit umamisavourysalty flavour. Another Year deals with a particularly British form of social breakdown and emotional constipation.In Britain from the 40s to the 70s there was widespread use of an exam system called the 11. Up until the age of 1112 students were schooled together after that point students considered to have more potential by the standards of the 11 examinations were streamed separately in Grammar Schools prepared for success whilst those below the boundary line were sent to Secondary Modern Schools where the focus was much more on practical education bricklaying home economics woodwork etc. The legacy of this system has been huge social resentment. There is a feeling in Another Year that the system is back in the form of university education. With the UK attempting to educate 50 of the secondary school student population to university level a socially engineered bifurcation to haves and havenots is being created once again.All of the characters in the film are from working class backgrounds and yet the fortunes that life has graced them with are distinctly uneven they have gone in different directions absent any idea of a shared experience that may have been the rock of previous generations of Britons. Graduates Tom and Gerri pun intended have fulfilling careers heartfelt love for one another high incomes and have had the opportunity to travel widely. Tom's brother and Gerri's friend Mary are aging and alone undereducated lacking in the kind of accomplishments that are social currency living with hurt and in Mary's case desperation. The message is not all one way old friend of the family Ken is also a graduate and yet has not managed to find a place in life either.Scenes in the movie almost exclusively concern Tom and Gerri's catering to this group of friends and family. They deal with the misfortunes of this circle with a mixture of humour irony good cooking and alcohol but mostly conceal their compassion and are helpless onlookers.The mating game is key here the unwedded 40s exist in a state of unsalved distress futureless scrapped. Even 30yearold Joe functional graduate wellemployed and witty has struggled to find someone to be with. A notable absence in the movie is a sense of solidarity community public events shared lives and shared values. There's an illiquidity in the relationships marketplace a lack of feeling and connection all leading to a general anomie and social constipation.However painful the lives of Ken and Mary are the film gives occasional glimpses of far more infernal lives lower circles of hell where dissatisfaction has paralysed characters with rage or utter resignation. Anything more than a glimpse would have made the film unwatchable.Gone are the days when WWII veterans would whimper their way through nighttimes of posttraumatic hallucination for forty years without mentioning it to a soul however the British stiff upper lip still remains as a guiding principle in this movie. There is still very much the assumption that one should keep one's private hell to oneself or else outsource emotion to a therapist.What may be controversial in the film is the way you look at how Tom and Gerri treat Mary. A German lady in the audience voiced her opinion to Mike Leigh that the way they treated her was to look down on her and that she felt this was inappropriate. Mike Leigh responded that the lady felt like this because she was a German and Germans did not understand irony. Maybe I suffer from the same problem because I for one felt that Mary was treated as little more than a baby and with a certain hauteur armslength love. I think people who are lonely need to feel useful. Mary for example was never allowed to help with anything though this does not excuse her at times appalling behaviour depression makes people selfish however I feel it necessary to point out as well that someone who is drowning in a river and calling for a life ring is also being selfish in the same way and I think metaphorically the position is very similar.Dour joyless watching maybe one for the Cabinet to watch after the example of the film La Haine which concentrated on French malaise and was screened in front of the French cabinet at the instigation of Prime Minister Alain Jupp.".

	schema:reviewBody "On the surface this is a movie about the day to day life of an elderly happily married couple Tom and Gerri their son and friends among them Mary and Ken. All seems well in suburban London until that very last shot of the film a most disturbing scene the climax of the movie.We see Mary at the kitchen table of her friends and as the conversation passes her by she realizes she doesn't matter to them any more. Worse we see it dawning on her that she may never have mattered to them at all in their relationship of 20 years. The comparison with her car is inevitable a vehicle that should have brought her a sense of freedom but turned out to be a lemon if ever there was one. As another commenter wrote it is a scene of exceptional cruelty. Can I nominate Ms Manville for an Oscar please ? How could this insincerity this notsomild form of wickedness persist over such a long time ? Perhaps it has something to do with the British fondness of manners but I think it has to do with work more specifically in Tom and Gerri's case with having a profession being a professional.A professional is someone who is applying a set of rules an algorithm to a standard input to produce a standard output. What distinguishes a professional from a craftsman is that the input rules and output are so complex that they defy supervision. Tom and Gerri are professionals and what they are doing is extending their professional attitude to their personal lives. Their relationship with Mary is professional. Their marriage is dealt with professionally. Their marital bliss is ultimately based on their contentment with the standardized output it produces. Tomatoes anyone ?Contrast this with Ken and Mary. Ken is an alcoholic in bad physical shape. He was once handsome however and has a good heart. His problem is that he questions the meaning of his job which in his case seems to amount to questioning the meaning of his life. And then there is Mary. Her goal in life is Love not work thereby committing the ultimate sin not making work your life goal that is.Two scenes illustrate the stranglehold work has on our lives and the importance of it for the movie's theme I think. In the first an Asian couple is visiting Joe an old man threatened with eviction and a young woman acting as his interpreter her ability to help the old man however limited to the duration of her lunch break. In the second Carl arrives too late for his mother's funeral having been stuck in a traffic jam. The funeral couldn't be postponed however another one was already waiting.So are Tom and Gerri right ? At the dinner table Tom is telling of how he and Gerri met by chance on their first day in university. This detail hints at the internal inconsistency of their way of life. And of course right at the beginning of the movie there is this session of Gerri with the sleepless patient an Everywoman. It shows her utterly failing in her role of counselor her very profession.Mary is indeed looking for love in all the wrong places. At the end of the film you realize that despite all appearances Tom  Gerri's was such a place.".

All seems well in suburban London until that very last shot of the film a most disturbing scene the climax of the movie.We see Mary at the kitchen table of her friends and as the conversation passes her by she realizes she doesn't matter to them any more. Worse we see it dawning on her that she may never have mattered to them at all in their relationship of 20 years. The comparison with her car is inevitable a vehicle that should have brought her a sense of freedom but turned out to be a lemon if ever there was one.

	schema:reviewBody "Lesley Manville as Mary truly deserves the Best Actor Oscar for her perfectly nuanced scary and convincing portrayal of a woman on the brink of personal desperation due to her many life mistakes and to her extremely fragile emotional nature that served to spiral her further and further down toward mental illness with every romantic disappointment and life mistake she made. Honestly I do not think Meryl Streep could have played this role as well. Lesley was that great in it. An astounding performance and so touching as you felt every pain Mary felt due to Lesley's spoton interpretation of her character's neediness and weaknesses and what they cost her.This film tells a storyby the 4 seasonsof a year in the lives of a UK couple and their friends. Mary is a secretarial coworker and friend of Gerri a professional counselor and the sweet wife of her wellrumpled and very likable engineergeologist husband Tomyes Tom and Gerri. Mary is the woman we all know at some time or another in our lives.... a woman too attractive to always be alone but always is alone after every failed attempt at a relationship always suffering badly from each failure to find what she wants so badly.Not much of an intricate plot here as in all Mike Leigh films but the story was such an absorbing and typical Mike Leigh take on the daytoday happenings in the ordinary and everyday lives of a normal UK couple and some atrisk friends. Tom and Gerri were the couple with these friends in various states of decline and they always tried hard through their gentle patience understanding and humor to help them and always be there for them. Ruth Sheen and the great Tom Broadbent played the wifehusband roles to perfection and were so loving likable and comfortable with each other and with friends that you wished you had them for your own friends. Wonderful portrayals both.See this film for engaging personal interaction and for the best acting performance of 2010 but be prepared for your own uncomfortable and awkward feelings throughout due to Mary's many sufferings and how her endless tales of them affected herlongsufferingfriends. It was a truly human story sometimes warm and funny sometimes pathetic and difficult to watch but at the end you knew you had seen acting greatness.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. How DARE he? Mike Leigh is such a noncompliant filmmaker. He just refuses to follow the rules ... and film goers are the benefactors of his daring. Mind you his daring is not in the regards of special effects stunt work or trick photography. No sir. His daring is with the subject theme tone and characters. He is ... GASP ... unafraid of real people! If you have seen Mr. Leigh's work in HappyGoLucky or Vera Drake you understand that his films can be simplistic on the surface while carrying multiple layers of commentary and observations. He also has the classic British sense of humor in that very few punchlines exist. Instead the humor comes in allowing the viewer to recognize the characters as someone they know or God forbid even their own self! Mr. Leigh has a history of making films without a script ... only broad based outlines for the characters. The actors then work to fill in the details of the individuals which in turn forms a story. This explains why the story does not follow the traditional arc. In fact the story has no real beginning or ending. What we see are the interactions of people who are friends relatives coworkers acquaintances and strangers. The foundation of the film as well as the foundation for most of the other characters in the film is the happily married couple of Tom and Gerri played by the terrific Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen. This is a couple who not only love and respect each other but also enjoy being together. Their friends and family come in and out of their lives but their bond is strong.Key amongst this group is their friend and Gerri's coworker Mary Lesley Manville. Mary is someone we all recognize. She is single not getting any younger desperately trying to avoid loneliness too often with a bottle masking her fear through fake excitement and latched onto the security blanket offered by Tom and Gerri's friendship.When family friend Ken Peter Wight makes a move on Mary she shuns him because of his lack of perfection. She always thinks she can do better. When she begins fixating on Tom and Gerri's son Joe Oliver Maltman we really feel her pain but just want to slap some sense into her. The relationships all take a hit when Mary shows up for dinner and is introduced to Joe's new girlfriend ... a wonderfully charming and talented Katie Karina Fernandez. Mary acts the selfish fool and it drives a wedge between she and Gerri. There is even a line of dialogue earlier on ... never come between a mother and her son! Another character we are witness to includes the great Imelda Staunton as a depressed middleaged woman who comes to Gerri for professional guidance. We also meet David Bradley as Tom's older brother Ronnie whose wife has recently passed.All of these situations and personalities are balanced by Tom and Gerri as they provide a stable environment ... it's as if they are a fountain of sanity from which everyone wishes to drink. As an added touch none of the characters are Hollywood beauties. Broadbent and Ms. Sheen would never be mistaken for Brad and Angelina. Rather they are more likely to look like someone you know ... and better yet their characters live like people you WANT to know. So again I ask ... How dare he?".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie touches upon current sociological and psychological conditions that result to alienation and loneliness. The theme repeats itself on the problematic characters of a group of friends in their 50s namely Ken and Mary as well as Tom's brother. They all resort to alcohol but that is the side effect of their problem not the root cause. There is an unfortunate equation between single people and despair. This bias is expressed also in the story of the couple's son who seems to worry during the time he is single and who 'has it made' once he finds a girl who assumes his parents' acceptance and friendship admits she is starving to people she just met no manners and licks her fingers no manners. Meanwhile Tom and Gerry are the voice of reason and somehow I felt they were also Mike Leigh's voice. Of course as others here have mentioned their portrayal may not be seen as virtuous as I have perceived it. There is a certain coldness within their kindness about them just as cold as the way the priest received the latecoming son of the deceased woman at the funeral. Mary who is at the centre of the film is a pile of trouble. She is turned down by Tom and Gerry's ugly son and Tom's socially handicapped brother only to get attention from fat and alcoholic Ken. In a desperate move to celebrate her independent life rather than mourn for her loneliness she buys a car but that only becomes a source of more trouble. As if Leigh wants to tell us that no car can give her the happy life of a married couple who live in harmony cultivating their veggies. The question that floats in the air can be whether her unbalanced character has caused her loneliness or vice versa. What keeps this film together are the masterful indoor scenes the convincing dialogues and the top notch acting. Careful considerations have been made in how people act in their everyday lives and that has been extraordinarily engaging.".

What makes the twist is something written in a different review and which is apparently a Continental European viewpoint if I must believe Mr. Leigh. The minor flaw of this film is that Tom and Gerri hardly develop and if they do it really is downwards as  when you leave the theatre  you are left with some questions as to whether they really are as warm and supportive as they appear prima facie. Why are all their friends alcoholic losers? And why are they so supportive yet so aloof? We found a few scenes that show how Tom and Gerri feel about Mary a shoein for any award because of the slightly overthetop nail biter performance by Lesley Manville. Their friends really make them feel better about themselves. Whatever may be of this Continental take it is a tremendously enjoyable movie as always.".

	schema:reviewBody "Trying to catch up with the Oscar nominees has been a disappointment. I can't see anything substantial about the 'great movies' of 2010. So a little movie like Another Year is a rare blessing.British filmmaker Mike Leigh and his ensemble of veteran actors  Jim Broadbent Ruth Sheen Lesley Manville Peter Wight David Bradley Imelda Staunton Philip Davis  get together for one of Leigh's improvised screenplays full of naturalistic dialogue and the result is a powerful drama sprinkled with a healthy dose of humour about loneliness alienation sadness the emptiness of modern life and that hard to explain feeling of being trapped in a room without doors every day of your life.Another Year is a triumph of acting and writing. All the actors perfect in their roles deliver mesmerising performances. This is the ensemble movie of the year  forget The Social Network or The King's Speech. Whether it be Martin Savage who bursts into the movie with the power of a tsunami and electrifies the screen with a performance burning with anger and aggression for a handful of minutes or Lesley Manville who's the centre of the movie draining herself out of energy like a power battery little by little as her character's life becomes progressively worse and she gets more desperate the movie never fails to personify the excellence of acting.The story divided by the seasons takes place over the course of a whole year and concerns the middle class couple of Tom and Gerri and the dysfunctional depressed people who orbit around them  coworkers old friends relatives. Welladjusted welloff happy they're like a rock of stability and counsellors to others. They organise barbecues in the garden cook for friends listen to their problems. Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen slip effortlessly into their roles radiating joy serenity and patience.The movie however would be dull if it were just about happy people. The underside of all this happiness is that it attracts the misery of others. Many people always in trouble slip in and out of their lives the old friend Ken Peter Wight who can't accept aging and the new generation supplanting his their distant son Jerry Oliver Maltman Tom's brother Ronnie David Bradley whose loss of his wife has left him sort of numbed. And then there's Mary Lesley Manville the emotionallydraining friend whose craving for attention and nurture leads to some of the tensest and most embarrassing moments in the history of recent dramas.At the start of the movie Imelda Staunton in a short but amazing performance plays an unhappy woman talking to a counsellor on a happiness scale of one to ten she doesn't hesitate to give it one she can't explain why she only knows that nothing changes and she can't remember any happy memory in her life. Without stating it this is the direction Mary is heading for.I think cinema in 2010 has created few characters as fascinating and complex as Mary. When she first enters the screen she looks like she's plugged to a nuclear power station  she just goes on and on and on and on without running out of energy a chatterbox to end them all. But this is all illusion. She talks because she fears silence the emptiness. She doesn't have much of a life she only knows Tom and Gerri she prowls bars looking for men she drinks a lot and she's decided to buy a car possibly because like drinking it fills her life with a semblance of substance. Her wearied face with its sunken eyes has sadness and fear carved deep to the bones. I've never seen Lesley Manville in a movie before I just know that for two hours I believed there was a miserable woman called Mary in London probably contemplating suicide. This is the beauty of the movie it makes the viewer imagine things that aren't there. Manville impersonates her character so well she gives it so many ticks and mannerisms the life of her character extends outside the screen I can still imagine her living now that the movie is over. The character is fascinating but Leigh also made an excellent decision to give it to Manville.The dialogue also serves this movie very well. Possibly the best scene in the movie is the awkward scene when Mary meets Joe's new girlfriend. In a previous scene Mary had made very obvious advances to him. When she meets Katie Karina Fernandez all her resentment spills out in the form of double entendres incomprehensible to Katie but obvious to Joe and his family. The tension just keeps rising and rising becoming unbearable but there's no respite for the viewer it keeps going and it's funny and brutally sad at the same time.Mike Leigh received a welldeserved Oscar nomination for the screenplay. He won't win of course but his loss won't feel as unfair as the snub Lesley Manville got. In a year when an overrated Natalie Portman is set out to win an Oscar for a mediocre performance that ticks off all the boxes on a long list of clichs about tormented geniuses coping with madness it's a delight to watch Manville truly embodying loneliness and unsurpassable despair. Perhaps it was too raw too realistic for audiences to digest. The caricatural Nina of Black Swan is definitely easier to cope with and we can even get aroused by her. Movies like Another Year easily get lost in the confusion of vapid press releases viral marketing and controversy. I'm not so deluded to think that time will restore it to its proper place in film history. I just hope that amidst all the noise generated by hype the people who can enjoy a movie like this discover it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The plot and character details are outlined elsewhere. This film is a superficial view of deeply unhappysuperficial people whose reasons for deep unhappiness are unexplored and unresolved. Since we learn almost nothing about these people and they certainly seem to learn nothing about themselves it is worst sin of all boring.The emotional centerhole of this film is Gerri the counselor whose inadequacy ineffectiveness is highlighted by an early scene with a potential patient the actress Emelda Staunton a working class person who presents with depression. After an introductory session it seems highly unlikely that Staunton will ever return since Gerri makes no connection to her which is the theme of the entire movie. Notably for a real therapist the first order of business besides making a connection is to determine Staunton's suicide risk which seems considerable she is asking for sleeping pills and suggesting that sleep is the answer for her problems. Avoiding the real larger problems is also a theme of this movie. We then see Gerri as the enabler for the alcoholic Mary a secretary at her work who she has known for 20 years. They go out to drink after work occasionally where Mary's drinking is not subtle. It becomes apparent that Mary has had a series of spectacularly inappropriate failed romantic relationships including one with a married man and during the movie an attempt at relationships with Gerri's son 20 or so years her junior and Tom's brother whose wife has just died. No effort is made in the movie to understand where this behavior comes from. Remarkably Gerri only suggests therapy for these destructive behaviors after Mary's behavior threatens Gerri in her family. Other developments show Tom and Gerri don't really care for Mary at all and probably never have. It is the ultimate irony that it is Gerri who tells Mary she needs to take responsibility for her actions when it is Gerri who needs to take responsibility for her own actions.Tom and Gerri's relationship is quite solid if smug and is apparently the main draw for the movie as a whole but in many ways is a clich of male female roles Tom being the technical sort and Gerri being in the helper professions. Tom gets away with being emotionally clueless. When asked by Gerri what to do with Mary his reply is that if Gerri doesn't know how could he. Tom's two brothers seem to be the logical extension of his cluelessness. Ronnie is essentially catatonic and totally estranged from his only son while another brother who we only see briefly is called a jerk even by Tom. There is no explanation for any of this.Joe the perfect son works as a lawyer for the poor where his condescension to his clients is equally striking. Joe and his new girlfriend Katie's relationship seems designed to parody his parents relationship. While there seems to be the implication of a close relationship of Joe with his parents in fact he kept the existence of his girlfriend from them for three months suggesting a substantial distance the girl friend had no problem telling her parents. His introduction of her to them is bizarre having her literally jump out at them from behind a doorway more or less the physical equivalent of springing her on them after three months. The parents take this entirely in stride and seem to think nothing of this trivializing what they have been waiting for for who knows how long. We see no discussion among Tom and Gerri what this might mean for them as a family or how this makes them feel. This serves to emphasize the distance the film has from the actual characters.Over and over again Tom or Gerri ask how are you when it is completely obvious that the person to whom this is addressed is collapsing.All in all a series of poorly connected people with no insights or resolution. If that is what you want here it is.".

She was jealous when the happy couple showed affection to each other. Or when the son brought a brand new girlfriend. Isn't jealousy a lack of something that one does not have?

	schema:reviewBody "Many many years ago as a young single woman I saw a counselor who helped me and who I thought of as a friend. When I married my husband I invited her to the wedding. She declined telling me our relationship was professional only. So when at the end of this movie the therapist Gerri tells the disturbed Mary who thought she was a friend of 20 years duration to see a therapist I had a different reaction to this movie than many others.This movie about the happy middleclass couple Tom and Gerri is more a cautionary tale that friends are not the same as family and that therapy and friendship evidently cannot mix. The therapist Gerri's friend Mary is a middleaged lonely depressed coworker who has been a frequent visitor to Tom and Gerri's home for 20 years. There are jokes that she was an auntie to the 30yearold son who in an excruciating episode she drunkenly hits on. When she encounters the truth that the son has a girlfriend Mary is inappropriate and rude. Even worse she is revealed as of a lower professional caste from the girlfriend who rather irritatingly fits in beautifully with the middleclass professions of Tom and Gerri.So Mary is a family auntie no longer and we learn in the final segment that she has not seen Gerri for some time outside work since the episode with the girlfriend. When she shows up at the house uninvited Gerri and Tom are surprised to see her. We see them staring at her through the sitting room door and I thought the expressions on their faces was so cold and even chilling. These were not the faces of friends who would normally be concerned for a friend who has come to them because of some trouble. This is when I first realized that the friendship of Tom and Gerri for Mary was only an illusion that to them Mary was just a person who had drifted into their orbit but who was welcome only when invited. Gerri tells Mary that Mary has let her down and that Gerri has had to put family first. She tells Mary that Mary should seek professional therapy for her problems. This speech is delivered in a professional voice. Gerri who is supposed to be warm and nurturing is cold to Mary as cold as she was in her counseling session with Imelda Staunton which starts the movie.At the same time Tom's brother Ronnie who has been widowed has not been seen at all during the prior year and has not even been mentioned. But he was invited to stay he is family. In the end at the final dinner the camera works its way slowly around the table. The talk among Tom Gerry their son Joe and his girlfriend Katie is jovial and cheerful and I would think unbearable for someone who has just days earlier lost his spouse. The camera hits Ronnie who is still nearly catatonic. And finally the camera focuses on Mary. You see on her face that she has realized that she is not part of the family she is not the auntie nor even really welcome.This movie I think is remarkable for eliciting so many responses.".

When she shows up at the house uninvited Gerri and Tom are surprised to see her. We see them staring at her through the sitting room door and I thought the expressions on their faces was so cold and even chilling. These were not the faces of friends who would normally be concerned for a friend who has come to them because of some trouble. This is when I first realized that the friendship of Tom and Gerri for Mary was only an illusion that to them Mary was just a person who had drifted into their orbit but who was welcome only when invited. Gerri tells Mary that Mary has let her down and that Gerri has had to put family first. She tells Mary that Mary should seek professional therapy for her problems. This speech is delivered in a professional voice. Gerri who is supposed to be warm and nurturing is cold to Mary as cold as she was in her counseling session with Imelda Staunton which starts the movie.At the same time Tom's brother Ronnie who has been widowed has not been seen at all during the prior year and has not even been mentioned. But he was invited to stay he is family. In the end at the final dinner the camera works its way slowly around the table. The talk among Tom Gerry their son Joe and his girlfriend Katie is jovial and cheerful and I would think unbearable for someone who has just days earlier lost his spouse. The camera hits Ronnie who is still nearly catatonic. And finally the camera focuses on Mary. You see on her face that she has realized that she is not part of the family she is not the auntie nor even really welcome.This movie I think is remarkable for eliciting so many responses.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was one of the most depressing films I've ever seen and I can relate to it after living 2 years in sad England. Contrary to what many people around the world think  British society is highly dysfunctional depressed lonely lacking in emotions cold insensitive and angry. This film depicts all of that. There is an old English couple who are together after years of being Married but they are awfully Boring people.... they have a son who looks like a potato and has no personality... and all the other characters in the movie are faaaar toooo depressing to even mention. Sadly  this is very true about modern British society  and I really feel that Britain is the most depressed ugly nation in the world. Compared to France  Britain is socially backward inept and full of loneliness and this movie successfully shows all that on the Big screen. Moreover Britain is UGLY  and the people are ugly  their ugliness stems not from their race but rather from their diet and depression caused by loneliness.It's funny but I compare this film to another recently released french movie  My afternoons with Margueritte  which was full of emotions warmth drama and beauty... and that is France for you. Even the poor in France are more human than any British  who have all become very cold insensitive people with no connections with their families society or friends if they even have any. There is no sense of community left in Britain  and it's become like this greedy money obsessed nation where people don't care for each other or for normal human relations. Another Year also shows the reality of family relations in the UK  a son is late for his mother's funeral and doesn't really give a damn anyway  his father lost his wife but seems lost himself...the day she dies he wants to drink beer instead of tea....these are all real situations in everyday life within British society. The little bit of multiculturalism in UK has made it somewhat colourful and interesting  and if it hadn't been for that I would have killed myself in this depressing country after a month of living here. The movie should have been named  Another Sad Year in Britain.".

	schema:reviewBody "First a confession I don't enjoy watching Mike Leigh films. For me they're a bit of an ordeal rather than a pleasant night out. 'Another Year' was no exception but it certainly made me think...Imagine you're looking at a picture one in which there's a wealth of painstakingly drawn detail. For the sake of argument let's call it 'The gulf between tolerance and understanding' A family is gathered around a table in a large suburban kitchen. They're clearly happy and comfortable all are laughing and chatting together a man and woman nearing retirement and a younger couple holding hands lovingly. From the clothes they wear and the surroundings you'd struggle to place the date it could be any time in the last forty years.In their midst are two others. A man gaunt and unkempt his grey moustache and fingers tinged yellow with tobacco and a middleaged woman one hand clasped around an empty wine glass as she fumbles for a nearby bottle with the other. Both stare from the picture unsmiling and trancelike clearly apart from the family scene playing out around them.What thoughts and emotions would the artist of the picture be trying to convey? Well work that out and you may be on your way to understanding this film of which this is the closing shot.The film begins in a similar vein with a woman that hasn't slept properly for a year her look also vacant and haunted. She doesn't drink has seemingly no means of escape from what's troubling her and can't remember when she was last happy. A doctor asks her questions trying to find out why she can't sleep and the story begins. It's a scene that needs to be watched very carefully without it the point of the film may be lost.Another Year closer to the grave? Or 'what have we done? Another Year over' Lennon My feelings are that the latter is pretty close the central characters have grown comfortably numb in their middle class lives pottering in their vegetable patch and commuting to work. They both seem blissfully in control selfsufficient free from stress and unhappiness or perhaps they've always managed to skilfully avoid it? During the course of the film though we also see the sad lives of others their friends family and associates people who could do with their advice and involvement. Is it given? I refer you back to the picture. You guess.As the closing credits roll perhaps we should all know what's keeping the woman awake?".

It's always good to see Calvin Lockhart working and I have a soft spot for Ram John Holder and his 'Black London Blues' but Leo the Last is buried by its pacing and an absolutely horrendous score by Fred Myrow who went on to better work in Soylent Green and the Phantasm series.

	schema:reviewBody "Frank Capra made a sort of little film in 1933 little in that it starred then upandcoming Barbara Stanwyck the future iconic star of Double Indemnity and The Furies had only been in a few films before and that it dealt with a topic that was very touchy to attempt for in 1933 only Griffith before had tried to deal with some kind of interracial bonding andor sexual tension between white and Chinese people on screen at least to my knowledge. What ended up working in favor for Capra with his story and what makes it still work today still despite the creaky bits of racist dialog i.e. Chinaman is repeated throughout by the supposedly tolerant missionary Megan Davis is the script. This has excellent dialog and a potent message about trying to make a difference to make some sort of change where things are perhaps in simplification hey it's Capra about the same as they've been for 2000 years.It's a message that infers some tendencies to prejudices on both sides of the white welleducated woman who sees to do good wherever she can and the stalwart General who will try to impress and act cordial around the lady but mostly because he wants to have his way which may be with her. The story itself sounds kind of typical probably because by today's standards it is Megan Davis has just come to China to do missionary work but is caught in the midst of a bad civil war going on and after a tumultuous battle she gets caught up in in the streets and is knocked out is taken into the 'care' of General Yen Nils Asther no not Chinese apparently but does so good a job as to not notice too much. She cannot leave his custody at his palace because of the battling blocking up the train tracks and has to stick tight... in the span of a week she tries to spare a life of a spy and almost falls for Yen or maybe more than almost.It's actually the one complicated and really exacting thing in this production is seeing Asther and Stanwyck on screen. I'm not sure if the latter gave quite a great performance but for what she's given she elevates it into a sternfaced but kindhearted portrayal of a woman caught in an untenable situation and Asther gives as good as he can by bypassing the obvious pitfall of stereotyping by making Yen a very human figure. He's a man of class and taste but also tradition and with that typical doubleedged sword of being ruthless with slaughter and elegant in decorum and in attitude. Somehow Capra is able to garner very good work from them with a story that in the wrong hands could become the most hamfisted thing on the planet.Luckily not only is Capra uncompromising in dealing with the issues at hand both upfront and underlying in terms of race and ethnicity and just the clashing of cultures but in technical terms with the bits of battle scenes the shootout late in the film at the train station is breathtaking for 1933 and pretty good for today and it shows a director so confident in his craft that he could be ready for better things. It might be dated... actually it is dated. But for any and all faults it's a picture made with surprising sensitivity and compassion for all its characters and it doesn't stick to clichs just for the sake of it  it's a solid drama without much pretension save for a dream sequence that's actually hallucinatory in the best way.".

	schema:reviewBody "After the collapse of the Monarchy of China  the Manchu Dynasty in 1912  various warlords with their private armies and areas of control were temporarily dominant. So in the film's beginning we are introduced to the chaos in Chinese cities that resulted from intense fighting between factions. During a powerful rainstorm Megan Davis Barbara Stanwyck meets General Yen Nils Asther briefly after her rickshaw driver is run down by his automobile. Miss Davis is on her way to a marriage with a Protestant churchman Dr. Robert Strike Gavin Gordon in Shanghai. But Bob finds out that there are children to be rescued at St. Andrew's Orphanage in Chapei. At the reception the minister demonstrates his priorities he tells Megan that he wants to briefly delay the marriage and work quickly to save the children. They travel to General Yen's HQ to get the necessary travel pass to Chapei. Yen thinks that Bob is stupid to defer his marriage to an attractive woman and thus gives him a worthless document that mocks Bob. Thus Bob and Megan have difficulty in removing the orphaned Asian and Caucasian children. In the chaos and fighting they become separated but Megan gets rescued by Yen who places her in a bedroom on his troop train. Later while asleep in his palace she is awakened by a firing squad the general is eliminating his enemies. As Megan is horrified Yen philosophizes that it is better to die quickly then slowly starve to death as he has no rice to feed his prisoners. Out of deference to Megan he has the surviving prisoners moved but only to be executed out of earshot. Megan calls him a yellow swine. Yen's reaction is passive. In conversation with his financial adviser Jones Walter Connolly Yen says he plans on keeping Megan in custody. When Jones responds that she is white Yen replies That's all right. I have no prejudice against her color. Jones retorts Well it's no skin off my nose. While in custody Megan tries to bribe Yen's concubine MahLi Toshia Mori to get a message to Bob. But MahLi is treacherous She takes Megan's payment a ring but hides the message. Before the halfway mark of the movie there is a fascinating dream sequence. In it Yen is a Chinese caricaturemonster who breaks down Megan's bedroom door to get at her. But she is rescued by a masked man who knocks the monster out flat. When she unmasks her hero she discovers that it is  Yen the rescuer! They kiss and caress as Megan is awakened by Yen dressed in traditional Chinese clothing. Skeptical of missionaries Yen asks her if she knows anything of Chinese artistic culture poetry music painting. Of course she knows nothing as she has only been in China for a few days. The general reminds her to accept his dinner invitation Megan rejected previous ones. Meanwhile Megan has noticed that MahLi is courted by Chinese Captain Li Richard Loo Yen's aide. At dinner Jones talks too much. A war profiteer he has been a master at gaining money from the provincials for the general at no small profit for himself. That does not matter to Yen as long as the goals of the two men are congruent. Meanwhile Yen removes MahLi's jade bracelets and rings and presents them to Megan who refuses them. Although they are forced upon her Megan returns them to MahLi who Yen has discovered has been betraying military secrets to his enemies. Megan successfully pleads for MahLi's life but by doing so becomes Yen's willful hostage.But MahLi is habitually disloyal. There is a short but thrilling action scene when two trains are parked parallel. A signal is made and a company of soldiers hiding in the gondola car of one open fire at the other Yen's money train. The shots are returned but Yen's forces are overcome as his enemies drive the train away. MahLi has again betrayed Yen to his enemy General Feng and has duped Megan. Without money Yen's soldiers begin deserting him his spacious palace becomes empty. More than fifteen minutes of movie time is focused on the pragmatic general's last day. With hope lost Yen has to drink the bitter tea but he dies in the arms of Megan. Megan and Jones sail back to Shanghai. Nils Asther the only nonAsian to play an oriental in this film has a tremendously strong screen presence. As General Yen he plays his role with dignity and intelligence and is mannerly. Barbara Stanwyck was usually good Stella Dallas Double Indemnity Walk on the Wild Side The Big Valley. Toshia Mori a JapaneseAmerican played her Chinese character well. She had some movie roles in the 1920s and 1930s. Walter Connolly as Jones is a sufficient oily profiteer who cares only for his master money!Frank Capra one of America's greatest directors is noted for well crafted movies and impeccable set designs note Yen's palace even with lower budgets. He was masterful in visual geometry and at using light and shadow for setting mood. Capra's gifts extended to action sets and character development. Although a Sicilian immigrant he lived the American dream and thus his successful movies often focused on idealistic Americana. Three times Columbia's great director won an Academy Award for Best Movie in the 1930s in 1939 he was chosen the top Hollywood director by Time Magazine. It was only after World War II when a deflated public became skeptical and so his It's a Wonderful Life 1946 was not initially appreciated.

	onyx:emotionText "After the collapse of the Monarchy of China  the Manchu Dynasty in 1912  various warlords with their private armies and areas of control were temporarily dominant. So in the film's beginning we are introduced to the chaos in Chinese cities that resulted from intense fighting between factions. During a powerful rainstorm Megan Davis Barbara Stanwyck meets General Yen Nils Asther briefly after her rickshaw driver is run down by his automobile. Miss Davis is on her way to a marriage with a Protestant churchman Dr. Robert Strike Gavin Gordon in Shanghai. But Bob finds out that there are children to be rescued at St. Andrew's Orphanage in Chapei. At the reception the minister demonstrates his priorities he tells Megan that he wants to briefly delay the marriage and work quickly to save the children. They travel to General Yen's HQ to get the necessary travel pass to Chapei. Yen thinks that Bob is stupid to defer his marriage to an attractive woman and thus gives him a worthless document that mocks Bob. Thus Bob and Megan have difficulty in removing the orphaned Asian and Caucasian children. In the chaos and fighting they become separated but Megan gets rescued by Yen who places her in a bedroom on his troop train. Later while asleep in his palace she is awakened by a firing squad the general is eliminating his enemies. As Megan is horrified Yen philosophizes that it is better to die quickly then slowly starve to death as he has no rice to feed his prisoners.

	schema:reviewBody "I would describe this film as sumptuous erotic sophisticated and emotionally complex. It is a 1933 Frank Capra film about a love affair between a Christian missionary's fiance and an educated Chinese warlord a film which broke the taboo against depicting interracial relationships just prior to the introduction of the reactionary Hayes code in Hollywood.As a work of film craftsmanship and artistry it is just breathtaking  starting with the initial scenes of chaos in the midst of a bombing raid where Megan Davis Barbara Stanwyk makes her first impression on General Yen through a small act of kindness. The crowd scenes are masterfully directed and the photography positively glows. Later on watch the superimposition of images as they gradually hover around Megan's face suggesting a dream state. Then in the train compartment the three main characters are assembled  Megan General Yen and Yen's concubine MahLi. Without a word being spoken the camera prowls among the three characters catching every little nuance of the eyes and body language as they react to one another. It is very intimate  almost uncomfortably so  and very dramatic. There is a dream sequence of Megan's later in the film too. I will not spoil it for you but it is provocative and jawdropping and it must have caused gasps in the audience back in 1933.The film is somewhat a psychological dance among the main characters. None of them is quite who they seem to be or even who they think they are. As General Yen's fortunes decline Megan's dearly held Christian beliefs seem overwhelmed by a tragic set of events that she has no control over but which she is inexorably a part of. Even when she is compelled to bargain for the Christian ideal of mercy Yen is stung fearing he is being taken by a missionary type while loving said missionary type so passionately. Nils Asther's performance as Yen is at this point heartbreaking.It has been commented that several Chinese in the Christian household at the beginning of the film appear in shadow and are depicted as sinister. That is not my take on it at all. If anything this film is antiracist .Those Chinese servants in shadows are depicted as being practically invisible to the whites at the party  people you snap your fingers at if you want an horsd'oeuvre or the piano played. David Lean did something similar in A Passage to India decades later. Toshia Mori as MahLi plays a fullydeveloped character and adds considerable weight to the authenticity of the movie. Oh and Walter Connolly as the resident white scumbag fatuous as he may sound delivers a lot of wisdom and expert postulating particularly at the end. He's a oneman Greek chorus.".

Not only does the film boast of superb production values a firstclass script  excellent performances but it enwraps its audience in a sensual romance which rewards intelligent viewing while offering a liberal dash of preCode sensibilities. Miscegenation so soon to become absolutely taboo in Hollywood here is made palatable  attractive indeed reasonable the natural outcome of passions molded by tumultuous times.Although billed second Nils Asther takes acting honors in the title role. A matinee idol during silent days Asther found it difficult to find good roles in talking pictures hampered by his exotic looks which made him hard to cast to his advantage. But with BITTER TEA he found the role of a lifetime. Although tall  Swedish he completely inhabits the skin of his Asian character making the General at once believable  sympathetic. His every movement shift of the eyes even the way he chews his food are all part of his persona. Nearly forgotten now Asther shows with this one performance what he was capable of achieving.As the missionary captive Barbara Stanwyck gives the kind of competent skillful  engaging interpretation which she would bring to all of her roles over the course of several decades. Capra's favorite actress the dramatic flames she lights are an intriguing counterpoint to the repressed emotions of Asther's Yen.Loud brash Walter Connolly as the General's financial advisor makes a good contrast to Asther his plainspoken character often gives voice to what the others are thinking. Lovely Toshi Mori graces the role of the General's unfaithful concubine. A young Richard Loo is her secret lover.Movie mavens will recognize Clara Blandick in the role of the feisty missionary hostess at the beginning of the film  Willie Fung as the rebel train engineer both uncredited.While meant to be funny and introduce the plot the opening scenes are a bit unfair to Western missionaries in China portraying them as rather fatuous repressed  gossipy. By in large missionaries lived lives full of selfsacrifice  devotion. In return not a few were rewarded with penury and an early grave. That today the Underground Church' in China numbers many millions of Christian believers stands as a witness to the faithfulness of these good people.The era of the Chinese warlord  such as General Yen in the film  was brief but colorful and extremely violent. The Qing dynasty China's last was overthrown in 1911 and the Republic of China was formed. Its despotic president Yan Shihkai relied more on military force than democratic principles to maintain his authority over China's vast stretches  huge population. Upon his death in 1916 the country was thrown into confusion  chaos with numerous military officers  powerful bandit kings all using their armies to control districts and even whole provinces constantly warring with each other amid a swirling sea of everchanging alliances and bitter feuds. Foreign powers Soviet Russia Imperial Japan  Great Britain only made matters worse by supporting various factions. It was the ordinary Chinese citizen who suffered most with the depredations of war's brutality  the inevitable famines rained upon them.

I was especially astonished by Nils Asther's portrayal of the General and I'm not sure I've seen him in anything else. It was a hypnotic performance as good a job of acting as has ever been put on the Silver Screen. The film was early Stanwyck but she was as good as ever and coupled with Asther they worked magic.The picture has been reviewed about 50 times now and everyone recaps the plot. It's enough to say it is possibly Capra's best effort. I thought the pace of the film compared to Lost Horizon the action and energy of the opening scenes and then the placid unfolding of the main story which in both cases turns out to be a love story  and then the knockout ending. Also noteworthy are the spectacular sets and the shimmering immaculate photography. I saw it at Cinevent Columbus O. 513.".

	schema:reviewBody "Definitely the most UnCapra film that the director ever made. It's a shame he never did anything near as good or interesting after because Yen is pretty amazing. A young Barbara Stanwyck is the fianc of an American missionary who is rescued from Chinese Civil War violence by the notorious warlord General Yen Nils Asther extraordinary. He takes her back to his huge palace and soon Stanwyck realizes he does not wish for her ever to leave. She finds herself being drawn to the mysterious Yen against her will a man who is both shocking in his cold cruelness ordering the execution of men in his palace groundsand yet fascinating in his cultured seductive manner. The film is best known for being a remarkable Precode attempt at showing a forbidden romance between an Eastern man and a Western woman but it has many other subtle layers too. Yen seems to be playing power games with Megan encounters that become increasingly charged as the film progresses. Megan's ingrained Christian attitudes and her Western beliefs are constantly challenged by Yen. The most talkedabout scene in the film is of course the remarkable dream sequence where Megan's subconscious attraction to Yen is obvious. It's an incredibly sensual scene and film. The atmosphere created by Capra and photographer Joseph Walker is astonishing and frame after frame is beautiful. Nils Asther's performance is remarkable and he inhabits his role so completely that we almost forget he is a Swede merely playing at being Chinese.".

	schema:headline " Unique Capra film";
	schema:reviewBody "Unusual strange interesting intriguing offbeat surreal unique film so atypical of Capra's acknowledged style that one truly regrets that he never made a film of this sort afterwards in his career.For sure a product of the more permissive PreCode era 19301934 it couldn't have been filmed under the Production Code's strict rules the only suggestion of miscegenation would have risen too many brows during its enforcement.I must say though that I have the impression that I saw an edited or censored version of the official release since the DVD I watched is of British origin it's not yet available on DVD in the USA and apparently the outofprint VHS American edition is 5 or 6 minutes longer. Well it shouldn't surprise me since this film was banned in England for many years reportedly for its miscegenation subject a delicate matter for the British Empire in those years.This fantastic tale of a Chinese Warlord's Nils Asther infatuation with an American Woman Stanwyck who's engaged to a missionary is charged with sensuality erotic imagery and sexual tension by early 1930s standards between the two leading players.Asther gives an intense credible portrayal and is simply mesmerizing as the Warlord in spite of the fact that he was actually Swedish. Stanwyck is aptly helpless confused and vulnerable as the heroine. It's also a pleasure to see Walter Connolly in a different role as an amoral entrepreneur. Toshia Mori is deliciously evil as Asther's doublecrossing mistress.This film demonstrates that the Occidentals at least up to that time still did not fully appreciate and understand Oriental Cultures dismissing its people as cruel and savage.Beautiful sets and dcors.".

Well it shouldn't surprise me since this film was banned in England for many years reportedly for its miscegenation subject a delicate matter for the British Empire in those years.This fantastic tale of a Chinese Warlord's Nils Asther infatuation with an American Woman Stanwyck who's engaged to a missionary is charged with sensuality erotic imagery and sexual tension by early 1930s standards between the two leading players.Asther gives an intense credible portrayal and is simply mesmerizing as the Warlord in spite of the fact that he was actually Swedish. Stanwyck is aptly helpless confused and vulnerable as the heroine. It's also a pleasure to see Walter Connolly in a different role as an amoral entrepreneur. Toshia Mori is deliciously evil as Asther's doublecrossing mistress.This film demonstrates that the Occidentals at least up to that time still did not fully appreciate and understand Oriental Cultures dismissing its people as cruel and savage.Beautiful sets and dcors.";

Before they even marry they are separated during an evacuation and Davis finds herself in the hands of warlord General Yen Nils Asther . Yen at first mocks Davis but soon finds himself falling heavily for her.The Bitter Tea of General Yen is filled with characters making bad decisions. Davis and Strike are nearly killed due to their naive condescension and trusting Megan is betrayed twice by her maid with huge consequence. General Yen cold and cruel as he may be also succumbs in his case to incurable romanticism. Only Jones Walter Connolly the arms dealer is grounded in reality to the dire situation that faces them.Director Capra ably provides scenes of both chaos  refugee evacuations night battles  and tranquility in the idyllic setting of Yen's compound palace where the General sets about seducing Megan with delicate charm while firing squads outside in the courtyard dispatch his enemy. Capra also finds time to get some satiric shots in at Western superiority and hypocrisy but it is the sexual tension between the leads that is at the center of Yen.Megan's ambiguity is excellently conveyed by Stanwyck's actions and immature responses to the different world she finds herself. She's totally out of her element and her western ways are constantly checkmated by Yen. As Yen Nils Asther cuts a dashing figure as the highly cultured warlord. He's cruel by occupation but sensitive in nature especially around women as Jones informs us and it ultimately brings about his ruin. His scenes with Stanwyck resonate with cultural clash and erotic implication and Capra ups the ante even further with a Freudian dream that Megan has. Capra went on to make more famous and bigger films but he would never approach the eroticism or cynicism that this provocative thirties work offered causing me to wonder if success took some of the edge out of him..".

I don't know if the original story was much different but even being preCode this film would be shot much differently nowadays  unfortunately of course! It appears to be just as hung up about love between the races as any other Golden Age movie was except the tale's conclusion is more open to interpretation and franker in its portrayal. But even that was spoiled by Walter Connolly's Jerry Springer type moral ramblings at the end as solace for any outraged whites.It's a murky atmospheric lustrous in the romantic arclight absorbing 83 minute journey through a rather horrible world populated by semi human beings  naturally Western wars are so much more civilised affairs. Throughout Stanwyck does her best and looks her best too no wonder Gen Yen fell for her! I hope modern Scandanavians don't feel too humiliated by Nils Asther playing a Chinaman though  v.v. As a non practising Christian I didn't take offence at the criticism levelled at Christianity's manifold moral ambiguities  but enough of all that!A wonderful film to sink into every few years not only for the story but also the gleaming photography the visual composition of the scene near the end where Yen is brewing the tea of the title is so achingly beautiful that it brings the tears to my eyes as I think about it! But remember it was made in 1932 so if you don't like shiny charming creakers it's probably not your cup of tea.".

	schema:reviewBody "Years ago I tried watching it off partway through the film because I thought that the casting of Nils Asther as General Yen was ridiculous and rather insensitive since he looks about as Chinese as Nipsy Russell. However on a second viewing I found that the movie STILL had a lot going for it. Plus like it or not casting Westerners in leading roles of Asian characters was the norm in the 1930s and 40sthere's no getting past this with only a very few exceptions.What did I like about the film? Well first off despite being made in Hollywood Columbia did an exceptional job in getting the look correct. Very impressive sets costumes and convincing battle scenes all indicate that this was a top project for a studio which at the time was definitely a secondtier company. Heck MGM and Warner would have been proud to make a movie that looked this goodand they were the big money studios. It certainly was a pretty film to look at and lovely cinematography sure helped as well.Second while the movie has some silly stereotypes in a way it is also very modern compared to other pictures of the day. It dares to consider the possibility of interracial love something banned when the new Production Code was put in place the following year and despite initially come off as a demon General Yen was quite decent and civilized in his own manner. He definitely was NOT some onedimensional Asian caricaturehaving greater depth than you'd usually find in nonWhite characters of the day.Finally while odd and fully of bizarre twists the plot really was pretty exciting and romantic. I especially loved the silly but majorly cool dream that Barbara Stanwyck had soon after Yen took her into protective custody! So if you are looking for an unusual pretty and very interesting film from Hollywood's golden era then look no further. This is quite an unusual film and you won't soon forget it.By the way after watching this film try SHANGHAI EXPRESS. While many of the plot elements are similar notice how different Warner Oland's Chinese warlord character differs from Nils Asther'sthere is quite the contrast.".

Read at your own risk!Anyone expecting to see something shocking from this precode film  The Bitter Tea of General Yen  is going to be disappointed. Miscegenation is not an issue today so most people will miss out on the big scandal! However it was a big thing back in the 30s and after the code came into full force a romantic relationship between an American and a Chinese man was unthinkable in a Hollywood film. This film is rather a mixed bag when it comes to racism. It starts out rather judgmental about the Chinese people but slowly our heroine starts to realize that there is more than one kind of logic. One of the best examples is when general Yen kills the prisoners because he has no food to feed them. Surely it is better to kill them than let them starve? And later Yen says something to Megan the audience is most likely to agree with You are afraid of death as you're afraid of life! We know he is right and by that time we want Megan to understand that she might have been wrong all the time. We've fallen for Yen as hard as Megan has. That is the genius of Frank Capra and the writers of this film. They make us fall for a man who is a mass murderer and a kidnapper. Megan and the viewers are all suffering from a Stockholm syndrome... or did we just let our guard  and our prejudice down? If the latter is what happened to you while watching this film then you know why this is a great and one of Capra's best. I wonder why it is not better know...".

This film is rather a mixed bag when it comes to racism. It starts out rather judgmental about the Chinese people but slowly our heroine starts to realize that there is more than one kind of logic. One of the best examples is when general Yen kills the prisoners because he has no food to feed them. Surely it is better to kill them than let them starve? And later Yen says something to Megan the audience is most likely to agree with You are afraid of death as you're afraid of life! We know he is right and by that time we want Megan to understand that she might have been wrong all the time. We've fallen for Yen as hard as Megan has. That is the genius of Frank Capra and the writers of this film. They make us fall for a man who is a mass murderer and a kidnapper. Megan and the viewers are all suffering from a Stockholm syndrome... or did we just let our guard  and our prejudice down? If the latter is what happened to you while watching this film then you know why this is a great and one of Capra's best. I wonder why it is not better know...";

What I didn't expect was how well made this film was.Normally with these old 30's dramas you get decent actors and a decent storyline with an average script. The actors have to keep up the paces to make the film work. This is not the case with this film. I was really surprised at the quality of every aspect of this film.The star of this film is not Barbara Stanwyck. Although most would think by her name alone it would be but she's very ordinary in this one. A lot of her 30's stuff is Joe basic average. The star of this is Nils Asther. He is an absolute chameleon in this. The makeup he has is so convincing you'll look twice. Even though you can hear his Swedish accent come through you can still see how good his attempt at Chinese was. This film was his absolute pinnacle.The action scenes are done very very well. The shootout close to the end and the sequence early on in the orphanage are really very convincing. I'm just amazed at how well this film holds up even in this day and time.This film is known for one thing and one thing only and that's the interracial overtones it has. I'm here to tell you folks it's so mild it didn't even come into play for my viewing. I mean it's there but the story really is about the downfall of a ruthless Chinese General. He's blindsided by the American girl he keeps hostage and his attempts to woo her.The ending though reminds me of a very similar film from around the same year...The Barbarian. Both have a very ridiculous ending. It doesn't fit with how Stanwyck played the character. I guess that's what the author of the book intended. Always confuses me how here and there back in the day at how Hollywood throws these curve ball films in to make America think about interracial issues. What's makes me laugh is does anyone remember back then any stars actually doing what they portray? There's no way they thought this would be a financial success back then with this subject matter.All this being said this is a really fine effort. Just a very well made and engrossing film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frank Capra good director as he was was ruthless in his ambition and selfpromotion. He began rather clumsily as a showy visual director. He quickly realised however that he would get more kudos by refining and restraining his technique. By 1933 he had gained a substantial reputation and enough weight at Columbia studios to push for his own projects. He decided what he would like next was an Academy Award and thus plumped for this sweeping love story set in foreign climes conspicuously lavish and actionfilled in the cashstrapped early 30s especially by the standards of poverty row studio Columbia. Surely he no doubt thought this would strike Oscar gold.Carpa chose for his star the rising and now very bankable Barbara Stanwyck. Stanwyck's greatest asset it seems was her ability to show great emotion even fiery rage without once slipping into hammy hysterics. She is all cool passion and it is very effective here. Nils Asther in the title role is very good too. He is a little theatrical and stylised in his gesture and mannerisms but like Stanwyck he is calm and restrained and certainly resists any temptation to turn the Mandarin general into a crude stereotype. And yet he is full of character. There's one great moment where he stuffs an unwanted cigarette into the mouth of a guard without even looking round as casually as if the man was an ashtray. Importantly Stanwyck and Asther have great chemistry and the performances all round are very fine.Carpa himself is obviously trying hard to load the picture with style and atmosphere with moody lighting and a roving camera. One of his best techniques seems to have been perfected here and that is his one of having the camera amidst a group of people like an imaginary extra person on the set. A really excellent example of this is in the first scene where the pastor makes his speech. The camera stays fixed while a number of other silhouetted figures stop to listen. This has the dual function of making us feel like we are part of this community and of drawing attention to the man and his words. The shot is punctuated by a neat whip pan into a closeup of a Chinese man's face. There is a feeling however that Capra is trying to turn every moment into a climax and pretty soon the exquisite shot compositions and endless whip pans start to dull in effect. The dream sequence in particular could have been a little less heavyhanded.All in all Capra has made a decent little film here. Minimal lighting and a tight editing pattern has cunningly disguised what is actually rather a low budgeted affair. Eerie sound design contributes a lot to the mysterious oriental feel. But in spite of all the director's best intentions The Bitter Tea of General Yen was a flop which received exactly zero Oscar nominations. Ironically while today some may object to Asther performing in yellowface at the time it was frowned upon for its positive portrayal of interracial love. It is also ironic that despite all his hopes being pinned on this one a different Capra movie Lady for a Day was nominated for Best Picture and Best Director. Lady for a Day is far less ostentatious but it is a lot more like the homely heartwarming fare for which Capra would later be known. Was Lady for a Day really better received because it was up Capra's street so to speak? Or did Capra deliberately rebrand himself in the mould of his first Oscar success?".

Nevertheless Barbara finds a lot that's intriguing about Asther.There is a less than flattering view of the white people here but not the usual criminal lowlifes who profit from war in China. It's the missionaries here with a sense of superior culture that comes in for criticism. Highly unusual and way ahead of its time for a movie theme.

Asther reacts the same way Yul Brynner did when Tuptim found him so nonappealing a question of vanity and pride more than of the heart.The interracial theme and the ideas way ahead of their time did not augur well for The Bitter Tea Of General Yen.

	schema:reviewBody "It's a pity Barbara Stanwyck looks so much like a young Margaret Thatcher Britain's 'Iron Lady' prime minister during the 1980s. Stanwyck's performance includes some of the selfrighteous polemic that Thatcher was famous for as well. Today's audiences will be forgiven for seeing Stanwyck as a rather prime and prissy Hollywood star who nevertheless is quite alluring. Her performance here is no exception to that rule.Straight off the ship in a precommunist Shanghai Megan Davis played by Stanwyck arrives in China to marry her missionary sweetheart and convert the heathen millions to Christianity. Will she succeed or fail at her quest after the marriage is postponed due to civil war and she is taken captive by the ruthless warlord General Yen Nils Asther? Some have called this Frank Capra picture disturbing and it is certainly unusual. The plot although including some wellfilmed action sequences if you look beyond some of the rather flimsy low budget sets is largely a psychological one playing out relentlessly to the bitter end.While the film stereotypes the Chinese MahLi Yen's mistress is played beautifully by the 21 yearold JapaneseAmerican Toshia Mori. She displays a timeless oriental beauty and economy on screen that has not aged at all in over seventy years. Indeed Mori turns in arguably the best performance in the entire picture although Stanwyck has a far harder role to play  which she does admirably. Jones Walter Connolly as a mercenary American in some respects prefigures the Rick character in Casablanca some nine years later sans to all appearances anyhow any moral scruples whatsoever.It looks like Stanwyck used a standin for the nude bath sequence but this is no fleshpot picture everything's filmed in a restrained style. However it's doubtful that the theme could have been tackled quite this way even five years later as it predates the censorship clampdown that was just around the corner which helped set in stone many Hollywood conventions.As with any picture from this era it is important to view it as a product of its age. In that context the film still plays well. Its heavyhanded dealing with ethnicity might disturb some modern audiences You're dealing with a white woman here! Jones advises Yen. Stanwyck is stunning  but paradoxically not in the soft focus shots finely madeup and in splendid costumes. Rather she reveals a raw energy in the few sharp bold closeups we get of her scattered throughout the film.Sure its pure melodrama hence the soft focus 'weepy' shots but it's played out on a psychological level. In this respect the film is decades ahead of its time. Filmically it was still close enough to the days of the golden silents to share many of the conventions of that age. An interesting exercise for anyone already familiar with the film is to watch with no sound. Does the film still work viewed that way? You decide!That the sound gave some challenges can be evidenced. Take for example a relatively unimportant sequence where Stanwyck and Connolly walk from one room to another deep in conversation. It appears to have been one long sound take but half way through someone perhaps missed a line or a mic dropped into the frame. Whatever the reason there's a jumpcut to a sameangle slightly closer shot midsentence with perfect lipsync. Then a little later another cut back to what could well be the original tracking shot  although possibly it's three takes spliced together. Nevertheless the sequence works and although technically we are seeing visual jump cuts the sound and action is matched so perfectly that they are not noticeable. Such quirks are well worth study by film students one reason why I consider viewing early Hollywood is so vital.Consider the movingtrain sequence which is carriedoff excellently. We have the train sounds in the background coming to the point where one wonders if there's a fault on the soundtrack. It becomes rather irritating which ironically is why it works so well. In later pictures we get the 'clickityclack' in the first shot and then down and under once the dialogue starts. This was probably a 'live' effect and not dubbed in later it certainly would have been the easiest way to get it in the can once the sound levels were established.This sequence is remarkable in another way as well. We actually have realistic movement on the set. Stanwyck's body as she lies on a couch is quite clearly quivering as the train races along the tracks. Why later films almost always show train carriages with everything bolted down solid and a slightly jumpy back projection is puzzling certainly a Hollywood convention that never worked. Later directors should have paid closer attention to Bitter Tea on first release but that might have been beneath their dignity since it was produced by despised Columbia Pictures on a tight budget.There's a religious context to the movie although it is not altogether clearly thoughtout or realised. There's a Buddhist temple sequence  a necessary plotpoint  but none inside a church. Stanwyck as the chainsmoking missionary is not above preaching and delivers some memorable lines You can always do so much more with mercy than you can with murder she proclaims following with an indirect reference to Jesus' sacrifice on the cross for mankind. Later she pleads I want you to think of all those things and then forgive But that's about as theological as the film gets. Can Megan Davis live up to the high ideals that she preaches? That's the big question the movie asks. And it's the crucial issue that General Yen stakes his life upon.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was clearly a rather high budget film for 1933 and interestingly was the first film shown at the new Radio City Music Hall. Directed by Frank Capra it is a precode film so there are some risqu scenes...well done. Its main distinction however is that it was one of the first movies to deal with interracial sexual attraction. Unfortunately it was before its time...it was a box office failure although in recent years it has been uniformly praised.Barbara Stanwyck and Gavin Gordon a missionary are preparing to marry in China. But the Chinese Civil War intervenes when they rush off just before their wedding to rescue some orphans. They become separated great crowd scenes and Stanwyck is rescued...or is it kidnapped...by warlord General Yen Nils Asther a European actor. Stanwyck awakens to find herself in Yen's sumptuous summer palace. She witnesses a mass execution ordered by Yen writes letters to her fianc that are never delivered and because she is thought to be dead he holds her against her will...well sort of because she has erotic dreams about General Yen wonderfully creative fantasy sequence. Stanwyck meets Yen's financial adviser  American Walter Connolly. It turns out however that the general's concubine is actually a spy and she is sentenced to death. Stanwyck pleads for her life and Yen agrees to spare her in order to keep Stanwyck. The general's army deserts him but Stanwyck goes to him willingly as Yen prepares to drink poisoned tea hence the title. And what happens??? You'll have to watch the film to find out. It's simply too stunning to tell you.There are 3 primary actors of interest here. The primary star is Barbara Stanwyck who is superb. I've recently watched several of her early films and I have been very impressed. Although I had heard the name I was not familiar with Nils Asther and after watching him here where he successfully plays an Asian man I hope to see more of his work. Walter Connolly  Yen's Western adviser  usually plays comedies but this is a serious role for him and he plays it very well.Highly recommended and you may even want it on your DVD shelf.".

Before they can be married they have to save orphans left in an orphanage some distance from Snanghai. While there the couple get separated and Megan ends up a guest of a General Yen whom she had actually met earlier. She also meets his mistress MahLi Mori with whom she becomes close. General Yen is attracted to Megan and she to him  both attracted and repelled  and when MahLi is accused of selling secrets to the enemy Megan begs that her life be spared.This is such an unusual film for Frank Capra and such an unusual film period. It was banned in England because of miscegenation even though the main characters are actually played by white people Nils Asther being Swedish. This is precode and the Hayes code really clamped down in the U.S. Anna May Wong was problematic casting for The Good Earth and Dragon Seed and therefore wasn't cast because she could not appear opposite a white man. Featuring an interracial couple even if they were playing the same race likely would mean the movie would be rejected by many theater chains in regions in which antiAsian prejudice was particularly severe. The new Motion Picture Production Code of 1934 pandering to segregationists forbade filmmakers from portraying miscegenation in a positive light. Casting a ChineseAmerican opposite a Caucasian might be construed as promoting miscegenation.The film is very atmospheric sexually charged and beautifully acted by the leads. It was particularly a tour de force for Asther though his career eventually fizzled. Walter Connelly plays a different kind of character a tough American siding with General Yen.Well worth seeing for its place in history as well as for Stanwyck and Asther.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frank Capra made an artistic masterpiece in The Bitter Tea of General Yen but it didn't make money. So a year later with Columbia near bankruptcy Capra made a smash hit It Happened One Night and saved the studio. So Capra makes more hits and some reviewers here act like he sold out. I wonder which films they saw?Actually Bitter Tea foreshadows themes that we will see in most of Capra's films the powerful vs. the powerless money and how it corrupts idealism and the obstacles to its realization. Capra was ahead of his time with many of his movies often outraging the establishment. This was obvious in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington but also in Meet John Doe which features a remarkably Rupert Murdochlike villain and The State of the Union which was 20 years ahead of The Candidate.Bitter Tea must also have been outrageously ahead of its time offending Christians and Americans not to mention Chinese. The cinematography by Joseph Walker is unusually beautiful and polished for 1933. But as he would work on most of Capra's movies this does not make Bitter Tea exceptional beyond that the print may have been better preserved than some. I find it strange that some would call this movie dated. The setting of 1930s civil war China is dated but not the movie. I could imagine this movie remade by Steven Spielberg today with modern equipment and he wouldn't need to change much.But what is so remarkable about Bitter Tea is the literary richness of the story. What we have here is the ideas of Nicolo Machiavelli in movie form. It is the story of the prince who has power and ideals but must also be prepared to wield naked power to achieve his goals. And it is the story of the naive unarmed prophet who has ideals but no power and no understanding of the worldly mechanisms for achieving those ideals. Those who have read and understood Machiavelli will understand this film.This is a must see film for fans of Frank Capra I've seen 11 of his films. If you get this far you might want to read Capra's autobiography where he talks about the film. Spoiler alertThe result is that the naive missionary unintentionally wrecks the plans of the general whom she learns too late might have accomplished great things.I love the ending. The Christian missionary vows she will never leave General Yen's side for the rest of his life. He promptly drinks poison. The ending a suicide was surely one reason this film wasn't the box office success Capra hoped for. I've seen many smart aleck critics say John Doe should have jumped on Christmas and I've tried to imagine how this would have made Meet John Doe a better movie. Capra had already tried the suicide ending and it was the right ending for Bitter Tea. But it would have been the wrong ending for Meet John Doe.".

Lee Thompson came out in 1986 with the actionerdark comedy 'Murphy's Law' whose texture is almost the complete opposite of DW3. While still carrying its fair share of sex violence and overall bad taste 'Murphy's Law' is a lighthearted film by comparison and makes neat changes to Bronson's onscreen persona.In a workmanlike script by Gail Morgan Hickman of TV's 'The Equalizer' Bronson reprises his earlier cop roles as Jack Murphy a Los Angeles detective who is going to pieces after breaking up with his sexstarved wife. Murphy is a heavy drinker who struggles to get out of bed in the morning when he does manage to rise he argues with other detectives on the force and nags his ex Angel Topkins who has begun stripping at a local nightclub.To fulfill Murphy's Law  if anything can go wrong it will  the justice system has released Joan Freeman Carrie Snodgress a psychopath whom Murphy arrested for murder ten years before. Deadset on revenge Freeman returns to knock off everyone linked to her case including Murphy and his acquaintances. Sure enough Murphy is collared for the death of his exwife and finds himself in lockup with Arabella McGee Kathleen Wilhoite a foulmouthed young woman whom he just arrested for driving off with his car. Handcuffed to one another he manages to take McGee hostage and escape from jail. The bulk of 'Murphy's Law' follows Murphy and McGee in their search for the real killer ticking off an alreadylivid mob boss Richard Romanus in the process.Like other Bronson films from the 80s 'Murphy's Law' doesn't boast Oscarworthy scriptwriting acting or technical work. The film is geared towards an average Bronson connoisseur with Charles quietly sweeping out the trash. But 'Murphy's Law' isn't without heart Bronson looks very human with a healthy amount of vulnerability. In what other 80s film does Bronson get arrested bleed pass out have a concussion make a friend and even sit down for a sandwich?Bronson and Kathleen Wilhoite don't have chemistry per se but to watch an odd friendship develop between Murphy and McGee is entertaining in itself. Although Wilhoite is given a ridiculous number of swear words to toss around jock itch and camel crotch are two good ones McGee still comes off as lovable a girl you'd actually love to hang around and steal cars with. Carrie Snodgress balances the humor of Murphy and McGee with an intense performance as the killer. The supporting cast including Robert F. Lyons Bill Henderson and Richard Romanus is quite good although Romanus is guilty of overacting in certain scenes as mob head Frank Vincenzo.Compared to J. Lee Thompson's other films of the decade 'Murphy's Law' is above average technically. The film was decently edited by his son Peter and Charles Simmons although you should watch Vincenzo's robe during the hooker scene and crisp cinematography was supplied by Alex Phillips Jr. another Thompson mainstay. Of disappointing quality is the music by Marc Donahue and Valentine McCallum which is synthesized and very repetitive. Wilhoite sings the more pleasing end theme.Highly recommended for action fans and a must for Bronson collectors 'Murphy's Law' is available on DVD from MGM Home Entertainment in dual widescreen and standard format with threelanguage subtitles. To my surprise the digital transfer is excellent showing crystalclear visuals and almost no grain. Murphy's theatrical trailer is included as an extra which looks shopworn and has Bronson saying Don't mess with Jack Murphy. Fill in the blank yourself.After 'Murphy's Law' Bronson and Thompson hit a dry spell with 'Death Wish 4' and 'Messenger of Death.' They ended their collaboration in 1989 with the engaging 'Kinjite Forbidden Subjects' Thompson's last film as a director. Bronson's wife Jill Ireland incidentally coproduced 'Murphy' with Pancho Kohner. out of 4".

It seems as though somebody is getting revenge on Bronson and his cronies for an unfortunate incident that had happened years prior. Very well done movie I thought at times it was a little cheesy I keep forgetting that this flick was from 1986. Not bad at all. Definitely a rating or two or three higher than Director Thompson and Bronsons next film combo 'Death Wish 4  The Crackdown'. It is worth a viewing. 7 out of 10 stars will definitely do.".

It seems as though somebody is getting revenge on Bronson and his cronies for an unfortunate incident that had happened years prior. Very well done movie I thought at times it was a little cheesy I keep forgetting that this flick was from 1986. Not bad at all. Definitely a rating or two or three higher than Director Thompson and Bronsons next film combo 'Death Wish 4  The Crackdown'. It is worth a viewing. 7 out of 10 stars will definitely do.";

Her face her dialogues her look were really FRIGHTENING. They certainly found the actress for the job. No doubt they wouldn't make films like that today since we are now living under the yoke of political correctness !

When you went to see his films you didn't go to see him do Shakespeare or Tennessee Williams you went to see him blow scum away and he always delivered. I think he had a higher body count then Clint Eastwood. Murphy's Law is probably the closest thing he ever did to a comedy. He and Kathleen Wilhoite made a good team as a foul mouthed street girl and a drunken framed for murder cop on the run. Wilhoite has to set some kind of a record in this film for the most swear words the most imaginative swear words. Bronson is stony faced as usual but that was just him. I like the scene where he plays Russian Roulette on that one mobster he literally catches him with his pants down. Jack Murphy is a burnt out drunk but you still feel for him. The only thing I couldn't figure out is why he didn't show them that bump on the back of his head after those guys killed his ex wife and tried to make it look like he did it? Lapse of logic there. The jail break and helicopter scene are the best part of the film as is the final shootout. Carrie Snodgrass is wonderful as the female psychopath and I love this exchange she has with Bronson You go to hell!...Ladies first!. Bronson was never really able to have another hit as big as Death Wish who could top that?. However this film is worth a look after all in how many films does the hero throw his groceries at the bad guys and get kneed in the cojones by the heroine? Look for 1940s gangster star Lawrence Tierney in a cameo.".

However Jack seizes upon an opportunity breaking out of prison while handcuffed shades of The Defiant Ones to a foul mouthed car thief Arabella McGee scene stealing Kathleen Wilhoite.With this team you expect some pretty straightforward and effectively sleazy entertainment. It's fairly violent as well as exploitative ever delectable Angel Tompkins as Jacks' exwife Jan plays a stripper and shows off some of the goods. Gail Morgan Hickmans' story is diverting throwing in a subplot involving a mobster named Frank Vincenzo Richard Romanus and creating a reasonable body count.What gives this otherwise formulaic scenario a shot in the arm is the give and take between Bronson and the sexy husky voiced Wilhoite. She's constantly firing off insults at him. While they were much more profane in the original script Wilhoites' oneliners are still ridiculously funny. And you can see that Bronson is having some fun with this premise. It's not often that he had a full blown sidekick in one of his vehicles.Other familiar faces that turn up include Robert F.

It is somewhat novel that our vengeance crazed villain is female and Snodgress is just fine as the kind of psycho who's well aware that they're a psycho.Capped off by a finale that offers up some fairly good suspense and a typically amusing Bronson quip.Wilhoite gets an introducing credit although she'd actually made her film debut in Private School three years previous. She also belts out the theme song over the end credits.Seven out of 10.".

Fantastic showdown anyway a lot better than in those more recent critically highly acclaimed crime movies I saw during the last 10 years. Hey you harsh critics what's wrong with this one? Murphys Law has a solid plot which is much better than most of those useless complicated stories of contemporary hightechproductions.

The scenes between Bronson and Kathleen Wilhoite are fun to watch exactly HOW many words of insult does Wilhoite come up with in this movie? and Carrie Snodgress is downright scary as a female psycho. Her opening scene with Bmoviestar legend Lawrence Tierney is chilling. To top it all of Bronson get to deliver a reeeaaally cool line before he blows away one of the badguys at the end. Nobody says the Fword like Charles Bronson that's for sure.Only one quibble the score the songs not included. It's like the composer walked out on the project and they had to do with some low budget prerecorded stuff. It's just awful how the music sometimes just seem to loop for two minutes and then tone down in a second when a phone rings or a line is spoken. I hope someone was fired for this.But asides from the soundtrack this really is one of Charles Bronson's best of the 1980's together with The Evil That Men Do and Death Hunt. If you're not a fan of Bronson I guess that's not saying much but if you DO like him you can not miss Murphy's Law!".

	schema:reviewBody "Murphy's Law If anything could possibly go wrong it will. Murphy's Second Law Don't mess with Jack Murphy. Substitute the usual word for 'mess.' Murphy's Law is a lot better than some people would have you believe. Yeah yeah it's a Charles Bronson film from the Eighties a period when a lot of film enthusiasts sniffed that Bronson was little more than a stuffed dummy who phoned in his performances. Bronson is one of those actors who make condescension drip from the lips of some cineastes. Charles Bronson was no typical Hollywood actor. He didn't have to be. With that wornout weary tough face he could set a scene just by being there. Bronson was Bronson and we knew the kind of taciturn honest relentless character he'd be. Bronson was a private man kept to himself was realistic about his talents and proud enough to deliver the goods. With all that said you either kind of like his star movies or at least some of them or you kind of don't. Murphy's Law is one I like. Jack Murphy is a police detective on the downslide. His wife a stacked stripper at a gentlemen's club who fancies herself a dancer has just divorced him. Murphy doesn't want to let her go drinks himself into a stupor most nights and shows up for work with stains on his rumpled suit and bad breath. Then his wife is killed and he's arrested for her murder. Jack Murphy knows he must find out who the real murderer is so he breaks out of jail. While he tries to identify the killer the killer bumps off one person after another who helps Murphy or who was associated with him. Early in the movie we know who the killer is this is no spoiler a psycho named Joan Freeman Carrie Snodgrass. Murphy put her behind bars ten years ago and now she's out. She's ready for some wet revenge. She leaves corpses in her wake. She pumps iron with a vengeance. She smokes. She's also handy with a garrote a cross bow and a pistol. Never never take a bath with her. With just this as a plot Murphy's Law might have been an efficient violent and reasonably entertaining Bronson movie. What I like about it is the gimmick  the relationship between Murphy and a foulmouthed young thief named Arabella McGee played by Kathleen Wilhoit. Murphy had been handcuffed to Arabella at the stationhouse after he was arrested. When he broke out he had to take her along with him. A movie clich? Sure. I think it works because of Murphy's tough stoicism and Arabella's creative and energetic profanity. There's nice chemistry between Bronson and Wilhoit. Wilhoit looks more like a tomboy than a cutesy starlet more a gamin rough around the edges. She's a good actress and holds her own with Bronson's screen charisma. When the handcuffs finally come off thanks to Arabella's lock picking skills she decides to stick around with Murphy. If he can clear his name he'll clear hers as being an accomplice in the escape. And off they go with Murphy now fighting a threefront war. Freeman is after him. A cop who hates his guts is after him. And a mob smoothie he beat up is after him. The climax is a rough battle between Murphy and Freeman in a dark gloomy building already loaded with some of her corpses. Arabella proves useful. Murphy proves capable.".

But Jack not only has the killer to occupy his mind he also has the mob hoping to bring him down as well.Murphy's Law is a very enjoyable and tidy thriller it finds Charles Bronson in a role that requires a cool veneer that he delivers is something of a given to this particular viewer but the unflustered nature of the character actually lifts this film above many of Bronson's other 80s efforts. The plot is simple and some of the dialogue comes heavy with a slice of cheese but the set pieces stand up and here we have a female villain worthy of the title. Carrie Snodgress is the lady in question and although underused because of Murphy's other plot strands she puts gusto and menace into the role of the vengeful Joan Freeman. A running plot strand involving Murphy and Kathleen Wilhoite's youthful and foul mouthed Arabella McGee only hinders the film instead of enhancing it tho the simmering sexual tension between the two does makes for an intriguing arc and it definitely helps the film's finale deliver the goods with added impact. Perhaps I'm being over biased towards Bronson?

He gets handcuffed to the dirtymouthed street thief he caught earlier. By chance they both manage to escape and Murphy goes after the real killer to only find out he's the one being preyed upon by the mafia and psychotic murderer.This tough guy image really works for Charles Bronson and makes any standard revenge story compelling. In it's defence this Bronson vehicle produced by Cannon might be routine but Gail Morgan Hickman's above average screenplay has plenty going on and throws our way a few effective surprises. The strategic story is grounded by its hard as nails approach where the sombre and seedy urban atmosphere can be a brutal smack in the guts. Even the humour has that dark touch but what did get tiresome was the constant pottylanguage and banter erupting from Kathleen Wilhoite's explosively charming character. Did it grate! The compulsively uneven but hardbitten script keeps on the move and can draw tension but never goes in to much depth of the characters and situations. What begins interestingly enough changes course for a buddy story with awkward attempts of humour and nastiness. In parts it kinda reminded me of Eastwood's superior action film The Gauntlet 1977.J. Lee Thompson's efficient direction is sharply observed and packs grittiness but really lacked the avid jolts. The professional camera work visually gets amongst the dirt but can provide some airy scope. The crisp sounding music score is very well balanced. A weary looking Bronson might look like he's slumming it in but his lowscale turn works accordingly and keeps you hanging on. Kathleen Wilhoite's lively chemistry with Bronson wasn't bad. Carrie Snodgress neatly goes about her psychotic part with utter coldness and Richard Romanus is perfectly cast as a seamy mobster.

One thing leads to another Bronson is framed for the murder of his ex wife and boyfriend and goes on the lamb stuck with a rather annoying punked out female character who at least has some funny dialogue. Soon Bronson's friends and some others are killed leading him to who the real killer is and Bronson must face her...yes a scary female killer in the final showdown. This is one of Bronsons better films. Who wants to see great acting with Bronson I want to see scum get blown away and this movie delivers it. I would say there was more then enough action and bit story to keep people happy. Along with that there is plenty of bad language and vile comments for entertainment value. Look for Bronson in the police station when he nails the other cop in the face great moment. Much of the movie Bronson is stuck with a girl named Arabella who has one of the foulest mouths one will come across who's gets to trash everyone she comes in contact with. Needless to say I didn't need to even see a hint of a love connection between the two. Bronson is way old and she is ugly so luckily that was not pursued in depth. Overall I enjoyed this movie although it does not have the action level of Death Wish 3 it packs enough of a punch for a Bronson fan. Overall 8 out of 10 stars. Don't mess With Bronson!".

She plays a young car thief who gets mixed up with Bronson and comes close to spoiling the movie thankfully there is still enough action going on that I'm willing to ignore her and call this a good film of its type.  out of ";

One of several collaborations between Bronson and director J Lee Thompson. Meanspirited and violent MURPHY'S LAW gets its laughs come from the unlikely partnership of Murphy and Arabella who become friendly as they attempt to evade law enforcement while trying to clear Jack's name.

Many might get a kick out of Wilhoite's smart aleck mouth as she spouts foul gibberish such as Eat boogers Watch out snotrag and penis envy towards those who get on her bad side.

Being from Austria myself you often get confronted with Schiele and Klimt  especially in Vienna to a point where you're basically sick of it. Because of that I never got to fully appreciate these two artists until much later. This movie did help me to appreciate the artwork more. I was able to see this movie at the premiere in Austria when it came out and haven't seen it since then though I would like to and I had to think about it many times since then. I can imagine that the reason many people didn't like this movie was because it's not what they expected. If you want to see a straight forward biographical accurate movie about the life of Gustav Klimt then this movie isn't for you. The basic premise is that Gustav Klimt is lying on his death bed and in a manner of flashbacks you get to see random scenes about a fictitious story revolving around a mysterious woman. Blinded by the fever the scenes appear surreal and deliver a feeling similar to what you may feel upon viewing Klimt's artwork. There's no straight plot following this movie and the real Klimt may not have been the way he appears in the movie but that was never intended anyway. What this movie does is brilliantly deliver an atmosphere very fitting to the Wiener Moderne. The very important Kaffeehaus Kultur at the time where intellectuals of Vienna spent the entire day in coffee houses is portrayed very precisely as well. I also think that Malkovich and Nikolai Kinski seem to be a near perfect cast for Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele. Anyway if you've read this review and get the feeling that this movie is not for you then don't watch it. But if you're intrigued by what you've read then by all means go see this movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "Well when I looked on IMDb for reviews on KLIMT a film I've seen and loved twice first in a longer theatre version now on DVD I didn't expect for a second that so many people hated it! On the 8 reviews on display there is only one to hail the film as a major work. So I feel I have to contribute and agree with my fellow Frenchman on that one. KLIMT is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It's original it's fresh it's bold and courageous it's incredibly beautiful to look at the music is exceptional and I have no complaints about the actors. Honestly I feel this movie is a great achievement for Raoul Ruiz. It's definitely not a biopic it's not even a biography it's more of a deep peek into Klimt's world a bit like David Cronenberg's NAKED LUNCH was an immersion into the William Burroughs' universe. And the peek's a peak. To me it's a film about freedom and a love letter to a time long gone when art mattered and life mattered. The women are incredibly beautiful Malkovich is believable as always in this kind of role which seems to bring about the best he's got to offer  like in PORTRAIT OF A LADY and DANGEROUS LIAISONS he's witty humorous and troubled and of course Young Kinski was an inspired choice to play Schiele. Well the criticisms seem to be about the film not being informative on Klimt's life. Come on! What do you expect from a film? It is a work of art not meant to prevent you from reading! So Klimt's life has been told elsewhere I guess. I don't know a thing about Klimt myself except having seen and been impressed by some of his paintings but the film completely captivated me. I feel everything here is like the director intended it to be and the choices Ruiz made are coherent throughout. Plus it's the best evocation of an era I have ever witnessed with it's been said before gorgeous costumes and locations and I've been watching three films a day for fifteen years. To conclude I'd say the film maybe takes Klimt's character as a pretext maybe Ruiz wouldn't agree to really tell us other things about life death art and mostly freedom. It also reminded me somehow in spirit if not much else of some of Jess Franco's best 70's movies also displaying a contagious feeling of freedom I would very much like to know if Ruiz would agree with that as one of Franco's actors is in KLIMT  Herbert Fux. Thanks a lot for a rare film that will stay close to my heart for years to come.".

	schema:reviewBody "The only thing that kept me in my seat after 2030 minutes of watching 'Klimt' was that I was too near the middle of the row to leave without making a fuss. However a quick look around me revealed more dozers whisperers shufflers and people with either stupefied or plain bored faces than I have ever seen.Why? In a few words this film is pretentiousness trying to play sophistication clogfooted hamminess trying to play world weariness gaucheness trying to play 'shocking' quirky 'cleverness' trying to play depth. John Malkovich's role was about as threedimensional as a flake of peeled varnish. Was Klimt really a deadeyed deadpan wimp who finished every sentence by showing 'bunny teeth' and who felt the need to overcompensate for being pathetic through occasional bouts of utterly hammy laughable violence on streets ankle deep in salt and endless humorless sexual encounters? Perhaps the only understanding the producer showed of the audience is their profound disinclination to have to witness someone as fundamentally unsexy engaged in such. Don't expect to get any insights into Klimt past what you could read on Wikipedia. About the only thing that warrants the use of the artist's name as the title is the occasional appearance of gold leaf egg whites lips and black lace. Apart from that it may as well be called 'Let's Go Loony with a Bland Old Fkwit'.The delivery was stilted the acting was twee and some of the devices used e.g. spinning the camera round and round the subject to create a dizzying background vortex were way too conscious  not to mention simply annoying. There were many scenes where you really felt as if your sensibilities not in the prudish sense just as in what passes score and what doesn't as well as intelligence were being roundly assaulted in a totally crass and meaningless way. Two examples that come to mind are the ranting dribbling raver and Klimt's ludicrously distressed mother and Ooh mom's at it  s'pose I'd better join in too sister. It was like watching a town hall production by people who don't get out enough.Shame on everyone involved in this movie. I have never been more disappointed at the cinema. It lacked any humanity it was wooden and unconvincing. It is pernicious as a credible plea for censorship. I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because if nothing else to a certain extent you have to admire gall.So do not waste your money on this film ... and whatever you do  DO NOT TAKE A DATE!".

	schema:headline " A MASTERPIECE! if one knows Klimt well but confusing otherwise";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a superb movie IF and this is a big if one is already familiar with the life and work of Gustav Klimt. This movie was intended as an art house film and was never meant to be a major theatrical release. However even for an art house film it is rather specialized in how it portrays Gustav Klimt and if one is not familiar with this artist and Vienna at the turn of the 20th century then this film is quite confusing and vague the quantity and quality of female imagery notwithstanding. Despite its very specialized nature some major stars are in this film though only one is an American and even he lives and works mainly in Europe. That star is John Malkovich who is in the title role. Malkovich gives a fine job though he does not resemble Klimt as closely as some other actors who have portrayed Klimt in the past most notably August Schmolzer in Bride of the Wind. The only other actor in this film that may be recognized by Americans is Saffron Burrows who portrays his great love interest. Her role is fictional but serves as a continuity thread through this film which depicts in an allegorical manner his career and life from 1900 when Klimt won a gold medal at the great Paris Exposition to 1918 when he died.The other actors are notable European actors whose works have generally not been seen in the United States. The notable German actress Veronica Ferres portrays Emily Floge Klimt's lifelong companion. Again unless you are familiar with the life of Klimt the role of Floge in this movie is very difficult to understand. And it is never explained in the movie. Basically Klimt and Floge were inlaws by the marriage of Gustav's brother to Emily's sister. The seemed to never have been lovers but the unmarried Emily seems to have been a wife as well as business partner to Gustav in every other respect. It was a complex relationship and Ferres explains in a side featurette The Making of Klimt the difficulty of showing this relationship. The Austrian actress Aglaia Szyszkowitz portrays Mizzi a model who bore two kids for Klimt of which one is shown his son Gustav. He never married her and the movie implies that he saw his kids only occasionally without financially supporting them in any noticeable manner. In real life Klimt did financially support his children by this woman. Of note is that the nickname for Emily Floge was Middi and the pronunciation of the two names is very similar adding to the already considerable confusion.The movie does portray Klimt in a negative manner concerning his offspring. He acknowledged paternity of four children and the movies deals with the other two as well as the two of Mizzi. Those children are dealt with almost as afterthoughts and one is positively embarrassing perhaps the ultimate embarrassment. In reality Klimt probably had many more kids and this concern is mentioned briefly in the film. The film is certainly critical of Klimt in this regard as well as his attitude towards women in general. There are some historical inaccuracies in this film such as a nurse in a Vienna hospital in early 1918 who has a VERY obvious British accent. This is highly unlikely to say the least to have been the case considering that the Austrians were in war with the British at that point but overall the historical settings and costumes are well researched. The movie overall is well researched but again quite confusing to somebody who is not very familiar with the life of this genius. I recommend that anybody who wants to see the film to first read up and look at the artworks of Klimt. Then the film will make sense and be seen as the superb achievement it is.".

It acts as if it was a biopic but in fact it is only one type of film a Raoul Ruiz movie. Ruiz takes up an idea and explores it visually and intellectually. Then he reverses it. He explores the relation between the idea and its opposite. Then he takes that relation and looks at its reversal... and so on there's always order but it's always tangled. It's cerebral but also surreal and playful. The film is among others about looking at movies and looking at paintings. Is art a functional depiction of the world as one character holds  does it work like a mirror? People who criticize this film for not being historically accurate seem to think so  implying that they don't like Klimt as his paintings were not particularly realistic either. Or is art like the other side of a coin a complementary reality to the one we experience daily? This is one central question of this film that shows a lot of mirrors and coins. In a painting or a movie a mirror image looks just as real as a filmed or painted object. Ruiz follows up on this observation. That is why there are so many doubles in the film. Klimt never knows if the woman he desires most is the original or a double. What does that mean for his feelings? He also meets his own double and beats him up. Then there are coins to denote oppositions. When he first visits that woman a servant flips a coin and Klimt meets her in front of mirrors. On another visit another servant flips a coin and this time Klimt steps beyond the mirror. The doublings and imaginations seem to increase exponentially in this film. You can look at yourself and you can be looked at. Klimt glances into a microscope and asks This is me? He visits a brothel where all the girls wear mustaches and enters a cage with a Gorilla mask on  the man who creates highbrow spectacles turns himself into a lowbrow entertainment. Yes it makes sense and yes it's hilarious. Not many period biopics make you laugh that much. This is also something not too many people seem to notice This film is funny. Fun is when opposites crash into each other and Ruiz knows that. I really enjoyed this one.".

I simply didn't understand the point of this movie. If one wants to find out more about Gustav Klimt's life THIS IS NOT THE BEST WAY to do it.Pre death hallucinations!?

There comes in fact the real point of the plot and the subtlety of the scenario if you are not 100 concentrated you will lose the tiny little string that attach this fine and intelligent story. Young Kinski is amazing as Egon Schile what a role Mr Malkovich is Klimt somewhere but the choice of young Kinski was terribly good because he physically looks like Schile.

Fascinating. We're also treated to scenes in which Klimt takes part in unexplained bouts of boxing in the middle of the street and in which he repeatedly talks to an Austrian government official who it turns out is actually invisible and just a figment of the artist's imagination. Oh and Klimt also visits a brothel where he dresses up as a monkey and where the prostitutes wear fake moustaches. If Klimt's story isn't worth telling then why bother? And if a film had to be made couldn't the filmmakers have produced something at the very least coherent? This is the kind of movie which gives biopics a bad name.

And I don't think it was because German was their first language and they didn't get the dialog...there wasn't all that much of it worth getting. What had we been subjected to? seemed to be a common thread of the lobby conversation I could pick up.I could only think how the Austrian culture ministry must be regretting the millions of Euro they contributed to this portrait of what comes across as a thoroughly insufferable national icon. After seeing this film they are probably thankful that many of the great Klimts in the Belvedere have been packed off to California and hope the artist himself could reclaim citizenship in that part of the world.

Take some public money from a European government select a writerdirector known principally if at all for his foreignlanguage films and assemble a cast of one American star and an assortment of European actors. Scramble and serve in a handful of continental cinemas that need films on the cheap.Raoul Ruiz's biopic of Gustav Klimt feels like what it is  a polyglot project made to please a national government rather than a cinema audience. It is by turns boring uninformative poorly acted directionless nonsensical and crass. John Malkovich in the role of the titular Austrian artist spends the vast majority of the film looking bored or dead perhaps appropriately since the translated script portrays Klimt as a worldweary man condemned to a creeping death by his syphilitic encounters with prostitutes.Other characters dart in and out of his life with befuddling rapidity either making imperious statements that are in no way profound or laughing at things that aren't funny. They also appear to be mounted on lazy Susans as one of Ruiz's irritating motifs is to wheel the camera around his actors so that the background is a dizzying whirl. This like his other themes breaking mirrors and requests for water are so heavyhanded that you wonder if his inspiration was an essay written by a teenage history of art student.The film is also kneedeep in absurdity only some of which is intentional. Klimt has two ludicrously staged fist fights on the streets of Vienna and there is one dreadful scene in which an unexplained stranger is meant to be doing shadow puppetry. It is difficult to suspend disbelief as the prancing figure on the screen is clearly not the man's waggling fingers but Saffron Burrows's backlit silhouette. Malkovich is obliged to play along however and slithers around in front of it casting no shadow of his own.Arguably the worst scene features Klimt chatting to Egon Schiele in a bar as the lights go out and a crazed tramp enters apparently to act out a piece of performance art about war. Schiele leaves in plain view and yet at their next meeting Klimt exclaims What happened to you? You disappeared. Bags of fullfrontal nudity and occasionally brave efforts at acting fail to disguise a film that ultimately tells us little about its subject or his art. He was we are told foulmouthed delusional and constantly thirsty. I'm not even convinced this is accurate. It is a film that desperately wants to be Amadeus but ends up being like Jefferson in Paris. Pointless and contrived this is Europud at its worst.".

There's no middle familiarity with him. Either you know him deeply you wrap your life where he has or you miss the passion. You think him dull.

Love must be dissymmetric. Narrative to have power must be a bit jagged inside where you want to go.I admit I think Malkovich was a bad choice. He really can be dull.

That an artist is selfcentered selfdestructive selfinvolved should always be selfevident. That came through clearly in the film. If the multitudinous and pulchritudinous naked women say anything it should suggest that Klimt is dying at a relatively young age of syphilis. The syphilis may have affected his brainhence he speaks to people who are not present. I don't know by the by whether Klimt did in fact die afflicted with syphilis the biggest defect of this approach to film biography is the reliance of the viewer to interpret accurately what is going on. A reliance best notwell to be relied on.So the movie presents an impression of the artist being an impression of being an artist. Not especially helpful if you have no idea of what is going on with the artist.Alas most movies about artists are less than stellar. There are those who hate Amadeus or Immortal Beloved for the same reasons they hate this move the technique of the film is nothing more than a celebration of film technique and not an exposition on the artist. Maybe FRIDA was one of the more successful films about an artist and exposition of the artist that does not fall into technique.If you have a need for movies that are linear than you may not like this if you don't mind the Fellini Saytryricon approach to movies then this may be the movie for you.

	schema:headline " Old saddle old gold";
	schema:reviewBody "I find The Train Robbers to be a surprisingly underappreciated western. The more times I see it the more I appreciate it myself. Sure the feel and the look may be oldfashioned for its time but I don't care. Kennedy Wayne and the rest of the group have obviously settled to make a fine basic western romp not a newstyled masterpiece and have reached the goal with very satisfying results. There can be seen a few little touches of Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West' the first scene of Ben Johnson waiting at the train station Siegel's 'Two Mules for Sister Sara' a sister Saratype treatment of the female character or Hill's 'Butch Cassidy  the Sundance Kid' the pursuing gang of riders. It also brings to mind Peckinpah's 'Ride the High Country'. But after these slight touches it's always back to the good old' Wayne stuff and I have nothing to complain about that.With the music underlining heavily the handsome photography makes some highly iconic and beautiful pictures. There are frames that look a lot like classic western paintings. The nature and the people are seen beautifully during the long ride through deserts rivers and storms. Sometimes it almost feels like watching 'Easy Rider' of the Wayne generation on horses. Let's go to Mexico.The action works fine like it always does when these old times film pros have been on the job. The men might be saddleweary but still gutsy enough and well worn like good saddle leather. You can tell the experience and good times as well from their voices. There is also a lot of warmth shining out of them specially from Wayne's side. AnnMargret has no real competition being the only woman in the picture. Besides sticking out from the right places she holds up pretty well especially with Wayne who easily blew other actors aside with his strong presence on the screen.With appropriately ironic note to its end the whole raid for the lost gold serves as a very good early seventies western and a decent one in Wayne's canon.".

	onyx:emotionText "I find The Train Robbers to be a surprisingly underappreciated western. The more times I see it the more I appreciate it myself. Sure the feel and the look may be oldfashioned for its time but I don't care. Kennedy Wayne and the rest of the group have obviously settled to make a fine basic western romp not a newstyled masterpiece and have reached the goal with very satisfying results. There can be seen a few little touches of Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West' the first scene of Ben Johnson waiting at the train station Siegel's 'Two Mules for Sister Sara' a sister Saratype treatment of the female character or Hill's 'Butch Cassidy  the Sundance Kid' the pursuing gang of riders. It also brings to mind Peckinpah's 'Ride the High Country'. But after these slight touches it's always back to the good old' Wayne stuff and I have nothing to complain about that.With the music underlining heavily the handsome photography makes some highly iconic and beautiful pictures. There are frames that look a lot like classic western paintings. The nature and the people are seen beautifully during the long ride through deserts rivers and storms. Sometimes it almost feels like watching 'Easy Rider' of the Wayne generation on horses. Let's go to Mexico.The action works fine like it always does when these old times film pros have been on the job. The men might be saddleweary but still gutsy enough and well worn like good saddle leather. You can tell the experience and good times as well from their voices. There is also a lot of warmth shining out of them specially from Wayne's side. AnnMargret has no real competition being the only woman in the picture.

	schema:reviewBody "I was in college when I first saw THE TRAIN ROBBERS. I was already a die hard John Wayne fan. I followed his later career with great interest. Since due to the political climate of the day one was not the most popular individual on a campus declaring the fact that you liked this star's work. I didn't simply declare this fact. I shouted it from the rooftops. I dragged all my friends to see this picture because I felt it both reflected the best of Duke's earlier work and still stayed consistent with the aging hero he was portraying. Burt Kennedy's lean and taut script reminded me of the best of his work on the Randolph Scott and Budd Boetticher westerns of the fifties. The simple yarn of AnnMargret hiring John Wayne and his crew of Ben Johnson Rod TaylorChristopher George Jerry Gatlin and Bobby Vinton to recover half a million dollars in stolen gold is very simple in it's directness. They are are gunmen who just stay on the right side of the law. If they were japanese they could almost be described as landless sellswords or ronin. They exist simply from job to job. The status quo for Lane John Wayne's character is changed by the presence of the woman. Mrs. Lowe He finds himself sexually attracted to Mrs. Lane a woman young enough to be his daughter yet still capable of reminding him of the things he's lost in his life.AnnMargret's character is curious about Lane who won't or more importantly can't talk about himself. Ben Johnson's character Jesse fills in the the necessary exposition but never tells more than he immediately has to. Burt Kennedy also plays with his audience. In BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID George Roy Hill has his leads chased by faceless men that they eventually are able to identify. In THE TRAIN ROBBERS our crew is chased by nameless men we never get to identify people who remain throughout the film as a constant unknown quantity. This is a situation I don't recall ever seeing before in an A grade Wayne western. There is a scene toward the end of the film where Mrs. Lowe makes an overture to Lane which he reluctantly rejects. He feels he is too old to have feelings of this nature. The film starts to proceed to what might be considered a predictable conclusion. Burt Kennedy does not oblige. He gives us a surprise ending that totally satisfies on each and every viewing. There are other considerable assets to this project. Dominic Frontiere's score is a rouser. The opening of the film and the first fifteen minutes contain no score at all. All of a sudden we have an expansive score on the par with Alfred Newman's HOW THE WEST WAS WON or Jerome Moross's THE BIG COUNTRY. The only other score Mr. Frontiere ever delivered on a par with this film was Ted Post's HANG'EM HIGH. The other major contributor to this project was William H Clothier superb cinematography. This was the last of his 17 collaborations with the Duke and no movie ever looked cleaner or sharper. I know this film has many detractors. Everyone is entitled to his opinion but I feel this is on the high end of Duke's later work. As for Burt Kennedy I feel he delivered a movie even Howard Hawks would have liked to claim as his own.".

	schema:headline " Wayne  AnnMargret Long chase in the Mexican desert for 500000 million in gold";
	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1973 and written  directed by Burt Kennedy The Train Robbers stars John Wayne as Lane a former Civil War officer who enlists a couple of his old subordinates Ben Johnson  Rod Taylor and a few younger gunfighters e.g. Christopher George  Bobby Vinton to help a widow AnnMargret obtain a hidden cache of gold to honor her family's name. They travel 200 miles from West Texas into the Mexican desert while being chased by a gang who also wants the money not to mention a mysterious man who has his own agenda Ricardo Montalban. While I relish this Western it does have its flaws. The story is wholly contrived and contains a couple questionable dialogues not to mention the yeah right activities of the Montalban character. But I've seen way worse Westerns the overrated The Searchers 1956 comes to mind. If you like authentic breathtaking Southwestern vistas notable Western music reminiscent of How the West was Won a triedandtrue cast including cutie AnnMargret and desert adventure marked by a long chase with numerous campingout scenes almost a survival movie not to mention an exceptional centerpiece set featuring a dilapidated abandoned train in the desert and a quality surprise ending you can't go wrong with The Train Robbers. The magnificent Western cinematography is particularly notable Myriad frames from practically every sequence could be used as awesome Western art. Then there's the fact that this is essentially a Western road movie albeit without the road you could call it a trail movie. On top of this you get some dialogue exchanges that are nigh iconic for the Western genre. For instance we've all seen those Westerns where the aging protagonist and a female half his age fall in love and ride off into the sunset but there's a scene in The Train Robbers where the hot widow reveals her attraction to the agedbutcommanding Lane wherein he frankly informs her I got a saddle that's older than you are Mrs. Lowe. This of course swiftly douses any romantic sparks. Some criticize that the title is misleading but it's applicable in three ways 1. Mr. Lowe robbed a train of 500000 in gold before the movie begins 2. Lane  his team rob the abandoned train in the desert and 3. when the group decide to chase the train at the end one of them specifies that he's going to rob a train! As for the cavil that there's no central villain and that the gang chasing the protagonists are faceless gunfodder while this is true you have to respect the film for saying Villain villain? We don't need no stinking villain. Besides there IS a villain in the predominant cast. A conman IS a villain albeit with a smile and charm. The ending reveals all and those who complain about the lack of a key antagonist are doofuses who can't see the forest for the trees.For those who scratch their heads at various elements of the plot just connect the dots from the various dialogues and it makes sense. It's all there. I admit that The Train Robbers is palpably flawed for the reasons cited earlier. If the filmmakers would've just taken a little more time and spent a little more money to work out the kinks it could've been a latterday Wayne Western on the level of True Grit 1969 The Cowboys 1972 and Rooster Cogburn 1975. Still its highlights make it not far off it's an entertaining cult Western. The film runs 92 minutes and was shot in Durango Sonora  Chihuahua Mexico and Yuma Arizona.GRADE B".

I don't believe I had noticed him before and more often he is a stunt man a breed I have unlimited admiration for but in The Train Robbers he has a strong part. Watch him in his closeups He is a by gosh actor strong but underplaying like the greats. This is an excellent performance!Bobby Vinton was one of the teen idols or former teen idols frequently popping up in John Wayne films but his performance in this probably surpasses any of the others. Watching him in The Train Robbers all I can say is Wow. He should have many more acting parts. Just a superb performance here.Chris George here Christopher George is another I think should be much more highly regarded and remembered. He was another superlative actor and his 57 credits is far too few for a man of his talent. I was once kissed by his gorgeous and also talented actress wife Lynda Day George but I had admired him even before that.Rod Taylor should have been cast with John Wayne more often. He could carry a movie by himself with his looks and ability but he stood tall with the Duke and with that wonderful Ben Johnson who was one of the greatest characters the movies ever had even if a time or two he should have turned down the role.Ann Margret had several good scenes but her first great one well all she had to do was walk outside and stand there throwing her jacket over her shoulder. She was just perfect for a partner to John Wayne.Then in one other when she has joined the men in fighting off the bandits the silent visual exchange with the John Wayne character is just perfect in the acting and the directing and the photography.Burt Kennedy has probably never turned in better work which he also wrote and wrote well and his cinematographer Bill Clothier was a perfect partner.Finally the music by Dominic Frontiere was also perfect accompaniment to this totally enjoyable movie. A friend another John Wayne fan gave me a DVD with The Train Robbers and Tall in the Saddle and I will be able to watch again and again.I highly recommend this film.".

The fact that the movie has less action that you'd think it takes about an hour for the first real action sequence to occur probably also hurt its appeal. But seen today more than forty years later the movie has a lot of appeal. John Wayne may be older and slower than he was in the 1950s and 1960s but he still commands the screen pretty well and comes across as very likable. Writerdirector Burt Kennedy keeps the movie moving fairly well despite the lack of action as well as a lack of tension there is no doubt that the protagonists will prevail. The movie also looks pretty good with professional photography and some visually striking backdrops. While the movie may come across as old fashioned a lot of the time it is without doubt entertaining.

	schema:reviewBody "John Wayne and voluptuous AnnMargret costar in writer  director Burt Kennedy's The Train Robbers a rambunctious western shoot'em up about a notorious outlaw's widow who hires the Duke to recover a halfamillion in stolen gold from her husband's last holdup. She wants the money returned to Wells Fargo so she can clear her husband's name. Wayne summons his trusty old saddle pals Rod Taylor Ben Johnson and Bobby Vinton to accompany him on this perilous journey. Taylor brings along a couple of young gunmen Christopher George and Jerry Gatlin to find the buried treasure. No sooner has Wayne AnnMargret and company saddled up and crossed the border into Mexico to find the fortune in gold than a train load of gunslingers show up and pursue them. Meanwhile lurking on the fringes of the action is an enigmatic but elegantlyattired cigarsmoking hombre who never loses sight of them. Our heroes meet at a lonely railway station in Liberty Texas rather like the depot in Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West. The small town appears empty. The wind blows across the boardwalk at the hotel and sways the rocking chairs back and forth. A metal sign buckles in the breeze. Jesse Ben Johnson of Rio Grande awaits the arrival of Lane John Wayne on a train that was due in the day before and everybody is astonished when Mrs. Lowe AnnMargret of Viva Las Vegas gets off the train with Lane. Jesse and Grady Rod Taylor of Dark of the Sun remember Lane as bullheaded and they discover to their relief that he hasn't changed an iota. Later we learn that Jesse and Grady served together under Lane in the Union Army during the American Civil War where they endured their baptism under fire at Vicksburg. Life for these three has been going up one hill of adversity after another. Feisty Calhoun stands up to Lane and Lane wallops Grady. Grady thinks that Lane ought to be happy that Calhoun stood up to him but Lane wants men who will stand alongside him not against him. Calhoun demands to know what they are getting themselves into and Lane observes that they are doing what any hired gun does . . . risking their lives. Earlier before Lane and Mrs. Lowe got off the train Grady told Jesse that he has shown up for the job simply because it amounted to something to do.After initial misgivings about endangering a woman on a long ride through the desert Lane and company head out. Before they leave the station Lane boils Mrs. Lowe's shirt so that her late husband's pallbearers won't mistake her as a man and try to shoot her. An army of twenty gunmenwe never see these guys up closeshadow our heroes across the parched terrain to the accompaniment of Rat Patrol composer Dominic Frontiere's giddyup score that signals the change of locale when everybody plunges across the Rio Grande into old Mexico. Along the way during several campfire scenes we learn more about our heroes. Eventually the feuding between Calhoun and Lane ends and they become friends. Finally our heroes find the railroad train in the middle of the Mexican desert. They dig into the boiler and find the gold but they aren't about to go anywhere because that ubiquitous army of gunmen that has been trailing them arrives. As our heroes fortify themselves for the ensuing gun battle Jesse and Grady swap memorable but pithy dialogue. Don't get old Grady warns Jesse you'll live to regret it. The twenty gunmen attack them but our heroes emerge unscathed largely becausein Lane's wordsthey could shoot worth a damn. Our heroes head back across the border but the remaining gunmen beat them back to Liberty and prepare a reception for them. Everything ends with a bangup shootout at the railway station where Lane met Jesse and Calhoun. Our heroes virtually blow the town to bits with dynamite so they can defeat the villains. During this fracas Mrs. Lowe pulls a fast one on our heroes in what constitutes an O'Henry reversal. The welldressed stranger Ricardo Montalban of Star Trek The Wrath of Khan turns out to be a Pinkerton detective who has been on Mrs. Lowe for five years. He explains that she was never married and that Lowe died with a bullet in the back in the bordello where Mrs. Lowe worked. She reveals that Mrs. Lowe's name is Lily. Our heroes scramble after the departing train that carries the pseudo Mrs. Lowe and the gold.Burt Kennedy got his start writing laconic but entertaining oaters for director Budd Boetticher in the 1950s. Wayne's film production company Batjac produced many of Boetticher's existential westerns so it is no surprise that Kennedy went on to pen westerns for Wayne. The first collaboration between Wayne and Kennedy was the superlative The War Wagon. Mind you The Train Robbers isn't half as exhilarating as The War Wagon but this nifty little sagebrusher never runs out of steam and the dialogue is fun to hear. Rod Taylor is nothing short of brilliant as Wayne and Johnson's friend. Okay all the characters are pretty much stereotypical and of them gets so much as a scratch. Wayne plays his usual stalwart hero and leathery Ben Johnson is his wise sidekick. Naturally AnnMargret is a feast for the eyes. The scene where Wayne tries to get her drunk so she will reveal the whereabouts of the gold is amusing. Later when she comes onto Wayne he deflects her amorous advances with the line M'am I've got a saddle older than you. Although it is painfully predictable from fadein to fadeout The Train Robbers qualifies as a ripsnorting adventure that benefits immeasurably from veteran Wayne lenser William H. Clothier's gorgeous widescreen photography. John Wayne fans will enjoy this familiar but engaging western.".

	onyx:emotionText "John Wayne and voluptuous AnnMargret costar in writer  director Burt Kennedy's The Train Robbers a rambunctious western shoot'em up about a notorious outlaw's widow who hires the Duke to recover a halfamillion in stolen gold from her husband's last holdup. She wants the money returned to Wells Fargo so she can clear her husband's name. Wayne summons his trusty old saddle pals Rod Taylor Ben Johnson and Bobby Vinton to accompany him on this perilous journey. Taylor brings along a couple of young gunmen Christopher George and Jerry Gatlin to find the buried treasure. No sooner has Wayne AnnMargret and company saddled up and crossed the border into Mexico to find the fortune in gold than a train load of gunslingers show up and pursue them. Meanwhile lurking on the fringes of the action is an enigmatic but elegantlyattired cigarsmoking hombre who never loses sight of them. Our heroes meet at a lonely railway station in Liberty Texas rather like the depot in Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West. The small town appears empty. The wind blows across the boardwalk at the hotel and sways the rocking chairs back and forth. A metal sign buckles in the breeze. Jesse Ben Johnson of Rio Grande awaits the arrival of Lane John Wayne on a train that was due in the day before and everybody is astonished when Mrs. Lowe AnnMargret of Viva Las Vegas gets off the train with Lane. Jesse and Grady Rod Taylor of Dark of the Sun remember Lane as bullheaded and they discover to their relief that he hasn't changed an iota. Later we learn that Jesse and Grady served together under Lane in the Union Army during the American Civil War where they endured their baptism under fire at Vicksburg. Life for these three has been going up one hill of adversity after another. Feisty Calhoun stands up to Lane and Lane wallops Grady. Grady thinks that Lane ought to be happy that Calhoun stood up to him but Lane wants men who will stand alongside him not against him. Calhoun demands to know what they are getting themselves into and Lane observes that they are doing what any hired gun does . . . risking their lives. Earlier before Lane and Mrs. Lowe got off the train Grady told Jesse that he has shown up for the job simply because it amounted to something to do.After initial misgivings about endangering a woman on a long ride through the desert Lane and company head out. Before they leave the station Lane boils Mrs. Lowe's shirt so that her late husband's pallbearers won't mistake her as a man and try to shoot her. An army of twenty gunmenwe never see these guys up closeshadow our heroes across the parched terrain to the accompaniment of Rat Patrol composer Dominic Frontiere's giddyup score that signals the change of locale when everybody plunges across the Rio Grande into old Mexico. Along the way during several campfire scenes we learn more about our heroes. Eventually the feuding between Calhoun and Lane ends and they become friends. Finally our heroes find the railroad train in the middle of the Mexican desert. They dig into the boiler and find the gold but they aren't about to go anywhere because that ubiquitous army of gunmen that has been trailing them arrives. As our heroes fortify themselves for the ensuing gun battle Jesse and Grady swap memorable but pithy dialogue. Don't get old Grady warns Jesse you'll live to regret it. The twenty gunmen attack them but our heroes emerge unscathed largely becausein Lane's wordsthey could shoot worth a damn. Our heroes head back across the border but the remaining gunmen beat them back to Liberty and prepare a reception for them. Everything ends with a bangup shootout at the railway station where Lane met Jesse and Calhoun. Our heroes virtually blow the town to bits with dynamite so they can defeat the villains. During this fracas Mrs. Lowe pulls a fast one on our heroes in what constitutes an O'Henry reversal. The welldressed stranger Ricardo Montalban of Star Trek The Wrath of Khan turns out to be a Pinkerton detective who has been on Mrs. Lowe for five years. He explains that she was never married and that Lowe died with a bullet in the back in the bordello where Mrs. Lowe worked. She reveals that Mrs. Lowe's name is Lily. Our heroes scramble after the departing train that carries the pseudo Mrs. Lowe and the gold.Burt Kennedy got his start writing laconic but entertaining oaters for director Budd Boetticher in the 1950s. Wayne's film production company Batjac produced many of Boetticher's existential westerns so it is no surprise that Kennedy went on to pen westerns for Wayne. The first collaboration between Wayne and Kennedy was the superlative The War Wagon. Mind you The Train Robbers isn't half as exhilarating as The War Wagon but this nifty little sagebrusher never runs out of steam and the dialogue is fun to hear. Rod Taylor is nothing short of brilliant as Wayne and Johnson's friend. Okay all the characters are pretty much stereotypical and of them gets so much as a scratch. Wayne plays his usual stalwart hero and leathery Ben Johnson is his wise sidekick. Naturally AnnMargret is a feast for the eyes. The scene where Wayne tries to get her drunk so she will reveal the whereabouts of the gold is amusing. Later when she comes onto Wayne he deflects her amorous advances with the line M'am I've got a saddle older than you. Although it is painfully predictable from fadein to fadeout The Train Robbers qualifies as a ripsnorting adventure that benefits immeasurably from veteran Wayne lenser William H. Clothier's gorgeous widescreen photography. John Wayne fans will enjoy this familiar but engaging western.";

It stars John Wayne AnnMargret Rod Taylor Ben Johnson Christopher George Bobby Vinton Jerry Gatlin and Ricardo Montalban. Music is by Dominic Frontiere and cinematography by William H. Clothier.Mrs. Lowe Margret hires Lane Wayne and his assembled crew to retrieve half a million U.S. dollars that her late husband stole during a train robbery.

However there's also a considerably large posse out searching for the gold and who is the strange man travelling alone observing things from afar? A TechnicolorPanavision production filmed out of Durango in Mexico The Train Robbers is small in plot but huge in entertaining heart. Stunningly photographed by the magnificent Clothier director and writer Kennedy blends action suspense and comedy as he straight out focuses on characterisations. With under ten speaking parts in the piece and man made property kept to a minimum it's very much a pared down production. But this in no way hurts the film in fact it's refreshing to see such an airy Oater one that is made in the 70s but feels very much like a throwback to the 50s production line of Westerns.The town of Liberty Texas forms the starting point for the movie a near ghost town of a place the arrival of the train bringing Mrs. Lowe and Lane feels like an intruder and accentuates the sparseness that will dictate the tone of the movie. Once the group head out into the wilderness it becomes about conversations and characters reacting to revelations born out by those chats. In the distance are the heavy numbered posse out for the gold as well but we only glimpse them like they are ghosts of the terrain they themselves intruding on the Lane group who as the journey unfolds start to bond and learn about life and each other.Once the group locate the site of the stolen gold it allows Kennedy and Clothier the chance to showcase some more striking imagery. Here out in the sand swept desert is what ultimately looks like a locomotive graveyard  the image is strong and it also signals the point where the film goes up a gear and the action enters the fray. All dusty paths then lead to an explosive finale and even as the dust settles we get a narrative twist that's very very cheeky. The cast are having fun and hats off to Margret who manages to let her Mrs. Lowe character be more than just a honeypot in the middle of mucho machismo.I love The Train Robbers I really do it's beautiful to look at and features cast and characters that are so easy to warm to. Sure there's flaws and it's routine and hardly treads new ground at a time when the Western was on its knees and struggling to stand up. But it's made with love and respect for those genre fans willing to whisk themselves back to the harmless days of the Western. Those moaning about The Duke's girth are very much missing the point of it all. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "The film western had already been beaten dead for US audiences by the endless stream of television westerns. The vicious surrealism of the spaghetti western had essentially overwhelmed the clichs of Hollywood. What's a film maker to do? Clint Eastwood successfully made postwesterns by following the cynical mysterious worldweary character he originated in the Leone films. What did everyone else do? Here's an example.The film starts with a modest imitation of the masterful opening sequence of Leone's Once upon a Time in the West while some characters wait for Wayne to arrive on a train. When Wayne finally appears the film switches back into Hollywood style. The dialog is largely by the book and the characters are about as interesting as any you would find in an average TV western. The photography is very good but it can't make up for the fact that at least 20 minutes of the film are long boring scenes of John Wayne and his pals riding around on horses against spectacular vistas. Sometimes they are being followed by a mysterious group of hooligans who pass the same vistas same camera shot!The first 20 minutes of the film has no music but when Mr. Frontiere's orchestra kicks in during those boring horse riding sequences we are treated to bombastic western clich music. Frontiere did some really good soundtracks elsewhere but this pales against much of Ennio Morricone's spaghetti western soundtracks.To the film's credit there are some good sequences and dialog. The scene with a crashed train that's half buried in the desert is neat. And the last scene in the film is funny almost makes up for the rest of the film. This could have been good but it would have had to be done in the 1950's when the western wasn't so pickled.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is another old John Wayne classic that despite being a bit of an oldie is still so much fun to watch. Being made as late as 1973 it is one of the later works of John Wayne. I quite like these later works where he is often playing a grumpy old hero.This movie is a good classical old western with a decent enough chunk of humor. It starts off fairly hilarious when Lane punches his friend for bringing a guy along who could not take orders. The continued muttering and bickering between Lane and his two old warbuddies is one of the things that makes this movie so fun to watch.The story is a fairly simple one. A widow of a bank robber hires Lane and his friends to track down half a million in gold that said widow's husband stole and hid. Naturally there are other parties searching for the gold. The entire movie centers around Lane  Co though with the other parties just being kind of around which is perhaps a bit unusual. Apart from a few closeups of a Pinkerton agent played by Ricardo Montalban who of course will always be Khan for us scifi fans and who has no major part to play until the end we never really see the bad guys in any detail. They are just a bunch of men on horses riding over the country side or shooting at our heroes.As is often the case with American western movies the landscape and scenery is also a contributing factor to the enjoyment of the movie. The choice of the abandoned train wreck in the desert was an interesting a bit unusual and visually pleasing one. I have to say that the town where the train arrived with Lane and where the final fight took place was a wee bit disappointing though.It looked like three scattered houses and a water tower.The ending was just as hilarious as the beginning. Actually more so. I just loved it when Lane rode after the train and in answer to his friends question explained that he was going to rob a train.This was some very enjoyable 90 minutes indeed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Widow AnnMargret hires John Wayne and his gang to go into Mexico and recover some gold stolen by her late husband. In the '60s and '70s John Wayne's movies featured him acting opposite an assortment of actors he had seldom if ever acted with before. This includes older stars who for one reason or another had never appeared in a Wayne film in the glory days as well as newer stars. Most of this is because Duke's old friends had either died retired or just gotten too old to play most of the roles in his films. You do have Ben Johnson here and he's solid but you also have AnnMargret Rod Taylor Christopher George Ricardo Montalban and Bobby Vinton. Gone are the days of Ward Bond and John Qualen. All of these actors do fine but none match Duke's screen presence. This was often the case in his later years where he had to carry the movies himself.AnnMargret's young enough to be Duke's granddaughter so the thought of them having a romance is pretty gross. Thankfully the movie never goes there beyond an amusing scene where Duke turns her down. It goes without saying she's beautiful and sexy as usual. Director Burt Kennedy was no fool and in one scene where she has to change into some jeans the camera lingers on her backside like a Levi's commercial. Speaking of Kennedy what was with all the horse riding footage? Did he have to fill time? Anyway it's light on action but pleasant overall. A decent timekiller.".

The chemistry is good but that's only part of it. In my review of The Comancheros I mentioned that Wayne and Stuart Whitman's chemistry was excellent and it carried the film. But there was a LOT more action in The Comancheros than in The Train Robbers. It's only 90 minutes and that is short for a feature film by 1973. There is a real explosive climax with the nameless faceless villains that have been pursuing the group at the end. And Ricardo Montalban's Pinkerton man at the end really gives an unexpected twist to the proceedings. That was pure Burt Kennedy.I think most fans of John Wayne will be disappointed in this one.".

Rita Hayworth is for me the most beautiful of all Hollywood actresses and the role of Carmen fitted her like a glove. a good movie...a little fake scenery that we could spot but fell greatly to my expectations but please don't be so hard on Glenn ford...he did a good job and his teaming with miss Hayworth will never tarnish.";

	schema:reviewBody "There are times when RITA HAYWORTH with her flashing eyes heady mane of tresses and way with castanets and Spanish dances amply fills the role of Carmen in THE LOVES OF CARMEN. She captures the flirtatious moods and stormy temperament without any trouble at all and yet somehow every ravishing closeup reminds us that she has just been all glammed up by the makeup artist every brush on her lips and hair and brows just given the royal Hollywood glamor treatment. Her glamor is so distracting that it renders her Carmen unrealistic even though she certainly has the temperament to go with the part.GLENN FORD is somber stalwart and rugged enough as Don Jose but it doesn't seem like ideal casting. He looks uncomfortable in much of the early footage and only comes to life when he has killed a man and must spend the rest of the film on flight as a bandit and desperado in the rugged mountains. His performance strengthens and his lovehate relationship with Carmen is for the most part quite believable.But some pseudoSpanish music in the background score with a hint of Bizet would have been a wise approach to scoring the film. And giving Rita more than a couple of fiery dances would have been a smarter idea. As it is her dancing moments are when she most completely captures the spirit of Carmen.It's entertaining in a lumbering sort of waynot exactly the most well paced version of the story. Hayworth is gorgeous to look at with a peaches and cream complexion that fairly glows in Technicolor but all of her closeups remind us that she is The Love Goddess being given the high gloss glamor treatment by the studio that made her a star.But reservations aside for fans of Hayworth and Ford this is a must see.".

She became a Princess and lived one wild jet setting life. She was queen of the tabloids back then.Carmen as done by Hayworth is beautiful fascinating and frightening. Scary in the way she just uses abuses and discards the male of the species. It's the perfect Rita Hayworth role for those demanding to see in my opinion the greatest sex goddess the cinema ever produced.The reason that The Loves of Carmen is not a classic is the horrible miscasting of Glenn Ford as Don Jose. Try as he might Glenn Ford comes off about as Latin as Curt Jurgens. Ford had the same problem when he was cast in Rudolph Valentino's role in the remake of The Four Horseman of the Apocalypse. Tyrone Power worked well opposite Rita in Blood and Sand but he was at the wrong studio. And it would have to have been the pre World War II Power. Someone like Farley Granger who could have suggested a callow youth might have been better.Rita cast Ford in the part partly for reasons of friendship partly because it cost nothing extra because Glenn was under contract to Columbia as she was and partly due to the big box office they became because of Gilda two years earlier. When Rita did return to the screen after her marriage to Aly Khan was over Ford appeared opposite her in Affair in Trinidad which was far better suited to his image. I won't go into the plot because the Bizet Opera and the musical Carmen Jones has made it all so familiar. Let's just say that between Hayworth's amorality and Ford's hormones it ends in tragedy for both.The rest of the cast does just fine. Note the good performances of Arnold Moss as Ford's commanding officer Victor Jory as the gypsy bandit leader Margaret Wycherly as the old gypsy woman who foretells the future for all. Most of all Luther Adler who is a cynical observer of all around him from Jory's band of thieves.But as in another Columbia classic The Loves of Carmen could have been a contender.".

Barbara Stanwyck only killed two men in Double Indemnity  she's a piker compared to Rita who gets two husbands killed along with Ford's commanding officer and other sundry victims after Ford becomes an outlaw. She's the definition of femme fatale.Overall I prefer Carmen Jones because of the music plus Dorothy Dandridge is almost as hot as Rita. Gilda may be Rita's defining role but this movie shows she can carry a movie and Glen Ford by herself. From the first shot of her on the ledge to the end when she dies from Ford's knife she is the definition of a movie star. Shot in glorious Technicolor you can't take your eyes off Rita and when she's off screen you just tap your toes waiting for her to return.Ford's wooden acting style is too underplayed here  it's an opera for goodness sake not film noir. His style was fine for Gilda but here you need someone with more of an overwrought flourish. I never saw the thunderbolt hit him when he encounters Carmen.Watch this movie if you want to see how a real cinematic sex symbol can carry a film something Marilyn Monroe never did. You can watch this with the sound muted and still feel Rita making this melodrama worth your time. She accounts for 8 stars by herself with the other star going to the great Technicolor cinematography. Had the dialog been better or the other acting more than pedestrian it would have earned a 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Loves Of Carmen 1948 Starring Rita Haywoth Glenn Ford John Baragrey Victor Jory Ron Randell Luther Adler Joseph Buloff Arnold Moss Margaret Wycherly Bernard Nedell Treveor Bardette George Bell Florence Auer Alma Beltran Lulu Mae Bohrman Nina Campana Jose Cansino Vernon Cansino Al Caruso Wally Cassell Lucille Charles Dolores Corral Tony Dante Peter Cusanelli Jerry De Castro Rosita Delva Lala Detolly Claire Du Brey Juan Duval Joaquin Elizondo Angela Gomez Jerry Fitzell Lupe Gonzales Barbara Hayden Eula MOrgan Paul Marion David Ortega Kate Drain Lawson....Director Charles Vidor Screenplay Helen Deutsch.Everyone has to die. And what a nicer way than to die of love.......The thing about director Charles Vidor's 1948 film The Loves of Carmen is this this is not the beloved Georges Bizet opera Carmen many know and love and certainly not a film adaptation of the dark 19th century French novella by Prosper Merimee from which the opera is drawn despite the writing credit given to Merimee in the film. This is pure Hollywood and pure Rita Hayworth at the top of her game doing her thing as the temptress sex icon for which she was known. By 1948 Rita Hayworth was an established Hollywood star. Her particular sex appeal came before Marilyn Monroe ever had a Seven Year Itch and after Clara Bow was The It Girl. She had done several films in the 30's but none of these brought her fame until she appeared in the 1946 classic Gilda. She was married to the great Orson Welles by the time she appeared in The Lady From Shanghai 1949. In this film she portrays the Spanish Gypsy Carmen who seduces the sensitive soldier Don Jose. Because she is faithless and is attracted to a more likeminded affluent bullfighter who can offer her a life of pleasure she provokes Jose's jealous fury which results in his murdering her. You know the story. It is the same old story sung in Bizet's opera. Some tiny motifs from that opera remain here such as the flower she gives to Jose the Lillas Pastias tavern scene the bullfight arena exterior and the smuggler's camp by the mountain passages. But even if this film attempts to evoke the original opera this film is not true to the Merimee novella it claims to be adapted from because it lacks the chilling and dark intensity of that work which has Carmen being more of a kind of tragic passionate lunatic than Don Jose. This is a familiar story given the old grand Hollywood treatment. It was filmed in Technicolor a rarity in those blackand white days because only the most expensive and major productions were made in color. Supporting roles played by Victor Jory Gone With The Wind Arnold Moss Ron Randell Joseph Buloff and Margaret Wycherley are welldone if a little too Western in their delivery. Wycherley plays the old Gypsy witch and the other men are all thieves and smugglers who associate with Carmen. The breathtaking scenes of snowy mountains dangerous passages stage coach robbery the streets of Seville dancing girls in colorful skirts and castanets and the bullfight arena are all part of a glorious panorama of old Spain that only Hollywood could recreate. At times because of the several fight scenes between the men and the stage coach attacks the film almost becomes a Western type adventure. Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford have definite chemistry. There's a sexual tension in that Don Jose wants to dominate the untamed Carmen but fails to do so and this is something only hinted at in the opera. I found that Glenn Ford a big Western star was right on target as the possessive jealous Jose who had never been that way before he met Carmen. Ford has a sensitive looking face but he has a strong beefy body that makes Jose a mixture of a sensitive lover and strong jealous type. His scenes with Haywoth brim with magnetism. But for all the good work Miss Hayworth has done in other films she is not an amazing Carmen. First of all she is too American for the part of a Spanishborn Gypsy. Haywoth learned a few Spanish words even sings a Spanish song danced in the traditional folk dances but her 40's hairstyle and attitude is not suited to the part of a liberated but tortured troubled 19th century Gypsy. She remains flat and never delves into the inner nature and psyche of Carmen. I found it hard to believe her as Carmen. Other than that the film looks great. Great Cinematography by William Snyder fine costumes by Jean Louis and music which seems to pay homage to Bizet and Spanish music by Mario CastelnuovoTedesco. Another great element about this film is the use of authentic SpanishMexican actors in bit partsbrief speaking roles creating a more lifelike Spain. And that black cat which gave Carmen all her bad luck running by the steps at the end is a nice touch if a little too on the nose. If you like Rita Hayworth this is a movie that only furthered her career in Hollywood and one that audiences back then truly enjoyed.".

And what a nicer way than to die of love.......The thing about director Charles Vidor's 1948 film The Loves of Carmen is this this is not the beloved Georges Bizet opera Carmen many know and love and certainly not a film adaptation of the dark 19th century French novella by Prosper Merimee from which the opera is drawn despite the writing credit given to Merimee in the film. This is pure Hollywood and pure Rita Hayworth at the top of her game doing her thing as the temptress sex icon for which she was known. By 1948 Rita Hayworth was an established Hollywood star. Her particular sex appeal came before Marilyn Monroe ever had a Seven Year Itch and after Clara Bow was The It Girl. She had done several films in the 30's but none of these brought her fame until she appeared in the 1946 classic Gilda. She was married to the great Orson Welles by the time she appeared in The Lady From Shanghai 1949. In this film she portrays the Spanish Gypsy Carmen who seduces the sensitive soldier Don Jose. Because she is faithless and is attracted to a more likeminded affluent bullfighter who can offer her a life of pleasure she provokes Jose's jealous fury which results in his murdering her. You know the story. It is the same old story sung in Bizet's opera. Some tiny motifs from that opera remain here such as the flower she gives to Jose the Lillas Pastias tavern scene the bullfight arena exterior and the smuggler's camp by the mountain passages. But even if this film attempts to evoke the original opera this film is not true to the Merimee novella it claims to be adapted from because it lacks the chilling and dark intensity of that work which has Carmen being more of a kind of tragic passionate lunatic than Don Jose. This is a familiar story given the old grand Hollywood treatment. It was filmed in Technicolor a rarity in those blackand white days because only the most expensive and major productions were made in color. Supporting roles played by Victor Jory Gone With The Wind Arnold Moss Ron Randell Joseph Buloff and Margaret Wycherley are welldone if a little too Western in their delivery. Wycherley plays the old Gypsy witch and the other men are all thieves and smugglers who associate with Carmen. The breathtaking scenes of snowy mountains dangerous passages stage coach robbery the streets of Seville dancing girls in colorful skirts and castanets and the bullfight arena are all part of a glorious panorama of old Spain that only Hollywood could recreate. At times because of the several fight scenes between the men and the stage coach attacks the film almost becomes a Western type adventure. Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford have definite chemistry. There's a sexual tension in that Don Jose wants to dominate the untamed Carmen but fails to do so and this is something only hinted at in the opera. I found that Glenn Ford a big Western star was right on target as the possessive jealous Jose who had never been that way before he met Carmen. Ford has a sensitive looking face but he has a strong beefy body that makes Jose a mixture of a sensitive lover and strong jealous type. His scenes with Haywoth brim with magnetism. But for all the good work Miss Hayworth has done in other films she is not an amazing Carmen. First of all she is too American for the part of a Spanishborn Gypsy. Haywoth learned a few Spanish words even sings a Spanish song danced in the traditional folk dances but her 40's hairstyle and attitude is not suited to the part of a liberated but tortured troubled 19th century Gypsy. She remains flat and never delves into the inner nature and psyche of Carmen. I found it hard to believe her as Carmen. Other than that the film looks great. Great Cinematography by William Snyder fine costumes by Jean Louis and music which seems to pay homage to Bizet and Spanish music by Mario CastelnuovoTedesco. Another great element about this film is the use of authentic SpanishMexican actors in bit partsbrief speaking roles creating a more lifelike Spain. And that black cat which gave Carmen all her bad luck running by the steps at the end is a nice touch if a little too on the nose. If you like Rita Hayworth this is a movie that only furthered her career in Hollywood and one that audiences back then truly enjoyed.";

There was much publicity surrounding the political thriller as it shot in Africa masquerading as Haiti and the fact that Taylor accepted half her usual salary and took second billing behind Burton kept gossips wagging for months she reportedly only took the part out of fear of being replaced with Sophia Loren.

Although the film is never quite as interesting or as suspenseful as it could have been I dare say that THE COMEDIANS probably plays a great deal better today without the heavy expectations of the time surrounding it.Graham Greene does a respectable job of paring down his complex novel for the screen and director Glenville keeps the film moving at a reasonable pace in spite of its lengthy runtime of 150 minutes. The film is always interesting and occasionally gripping although Greene and Glenville keep the audience at a relative distance which prevents the picture from striking as hard as it could have. Burton is in good form and Alec Guinness Paul Ford and Lillian Gish all turn in top notch support only Peter Ustinov feels under utilized. Unfortunately Taylor is dreadfully miscast as a German military wife  complete with a woefully unconvincing accent  and her illfitting presence creates several lulls in the film as the number of scenes between her character and Burton's character are increased in order to give the diva her proper screen time which hampers a few long stretches of the film and slightly undermines what could have been a firstrate effort.".

At the time Haiti was mired in the worst poverty on this side of the globe with the overwhelmingly brutal dictatorship of Papa Doc Duvalier. Duvalier and his family are gone now but the brutality and poverty remain.The title from the original Graham Greene novel refers to the various white people here who are very different but who handle what they see in Haiti by making a lot of bad jokes. Whatever else this is The Comedians is not a comedy.Burton and Taylor play the owner of a hotel in PortAuPrince and she is the wife of an ambassador from some foreign country unnamed. They're having an affair she's married to Peter Ustinov. Paul Ford and Lillian Gish are a husband and wife and he once ran for president on the Vegetarian Party ticket. He wants to start a business a vegetarian resort of sorts. These two are totally clueless but so are the Haitians they deal with they actually treat Ford like a big deal.Alec Guinness plays a part similar to the part David Niven had in Separate Tables he's an arms dealer who's been dealing with someone now out of favor with the regime. But while at first he's clapped in prison Guinness makes a deal with another faction who think he's a big deal with his heralded background of being a war hero in the Burmese campaign in World War II. If you've seen Separate Tables than you can equate Guinness with Niven.These name players however take a back seat to some of the black performers in The Comedians. Roscoe Lee Browne Cicely Tyson Gloria Foster Georg Stanford Brown all are different types of Haitians from different levels of society there. But the guy to really watch is Raymond St. Jacques. As a captain in Duvalier's police he is one truly malevolent being. St. Jacques steals all the scenes he's in.Of course Papa Doc didn't allow The Comedians to be shot in Haiti but the country of Dahomey one of the new African Republics served well as a place with a poverty level similar to Papa Doc's little satrapy. The Comedians which was not a big hit at the time is maybe more relevant today as we can see things there without the filter of the Cold War between two superpowers.Liz and Dick did a good one here one for the ages.".

There is an acclaimed novelist whose novel this was adapted from an exciting premise British expatriates in Haiti brutally ruled by the brutal and eccentric Papa Doc Duvliar's get caught up in political oppression and rebellion an starstudded ensemble cast and exotic locations. So why does it fall so flat? Part of the problem is that it the film is overlong lasting for around two and a half hours. The result is a story which moves very slowly with a lot of excess chat. Also there is too much emphasis on the dreary soap opera love triangle of the three main characters Richard Burton Elizabeth Taylor and Peter Ustinov. The Burton character a cynical hotel owner of British decent is obviously copied on the Humphrey Bogard character in Cassablanca. The film also fails to take advantage of the official oppression and corruption which is the cause of the country's problems. There is little sense of danger until the last half hour and even then the action is sporadic. There is also a failure to take advantage of the locations. The film was shot in Benin an African country which isn't a convincing substitute for Haiti though there was obviously no way this could have been shot in Haiti itself. But the photography is pretty ordinary. There are a few good scenes including a voodoo ceremony and a shootout in a cemetery. Also some supporting characters are actually rather interesting helped by fine performances by James Earl Jones as a surgeon who supports the rebels and Raymond St. Jacques as a sinister police commander who tortures and murders people as casually as most people would order a takeout lunch. Unfortunately but most of the film is a case of missed opportunities. It's passable but overlong and never worthy of the talent that went into it.".

The film was shot in Benin an African country which isn't a convincing substitute for Haiti though there was obviously no way this could have been shot in Haiti itself. But the photography is pretty ordinary. There are a few good scenes including a voodoo ceremony and a shootout in a cemetery. Also some supporting characters are actually rather interesting helped by fine performances by James Earl Jones as a surgeon who supports the rebels and Raymond St. Jacques as a sinister police commander who tortures and murders people as casually as most people would order a takeout lunch. Unfortunately but most of the film is a case of missed opportunities. It's passable but overlong and never worthy of the talent that went into it.";

	schema:reviewBody "When I bought The Comedians in DVD I had never heard before of that movie although I am a fan of the cinema of the specific era. Moreover it surprised me I didn't know anything about a film with such an excellent cast it isn't easy to find Burton Taylor Guinness Ustinov Gish and Ford in the same movie. And there was something else it was based on a novel and written for the screen by an author whose work I admire Graham Greene. Therefore I was curious to find out why a movie with so many virtues flopped and was so soon forgotten. After watching it I understood The Comedians is a movie that was made for the general audience a film that should be fun fast and easy to digest a typical Hollywood epic. However it contains none of the classic ingredients a it isn't fun it is a serious political drama with a deeply British cynical and black humour b it is not melodramatic enough and the love story between Burton and Taylor evolves quite unorthodoxically without any clichs c it isn't fast at all it's almost three hours without impressive action scenes and much  quite sophisticated  dialogue d it isn't easy to digest it is a sad and bitter movie with an ambiguous ending. These are the reasons why The Comedians flopped but they are also the reasons that make the film exceptionally interesting. Set in Tahiti during the dictatorship of Francois Duvalier Papa Doc an ideal location for Graham Greene's stories it demonstrates the cruelty of the regime through the story of 6 Westerners and some locals in the background. It is a big flawless production providing food for thought accompanied by excellent cinematography professional directing and a slow but strong and memorable scenario. The claustrophobic atmosphere of the brutal dictatorship is exceptional the actors give magnificent performances and it is also one of the few films that end without an answer without a typical happy or tragic ending. I recommend it to viewers that enjoy films that provide more than a pleasant evening.".

There is almost an unrecognizable James Earl Jones whose fabulous voice is overshadowed in this film by those of Burton and the suave Guinness.I have no faith in faith rants Brown Burton the antihero of the filma typical Greene character compare with Greene's 'The Burntout case'. Cynicism is turned into comedy. The splashes of Catholic motifs made in passing reference defrocked priest hark back to Burton's earlier role in Night of Iguana. Guinness' reference to looking like a Lawrence of Arabia recalls his own role as Prince Faisal in Lean's movie. Not having read Greene's book I am not sure whether Greene introduced these clever details into the script to suit the actors or whether the details had previously existed in the book.The gradual unmasking of the Major Guinness is a treat creatively captured by Glenville and Greene. The final speech made by Burton to his group of ragged rebels seem to have a common comic thread with George Clooney's speech to his soldiers towards the end of the recent Mallick's The Thin Red Line.Ustinov's diplomat and Taylor's vulnerable diplomat's wife who admits to her lover that he is the fourth adventure are both comediansGreene's likable misfits who cannot change their destiny and are strangely reconciled to accept their inevitable end. All the four main characters are prepared for their destiny they have designed for themselves as a consequence of previous actions in life. The closing shot of the film is a shot of a suggestive blue sky redeeming the foibles of the comedians on terra firma.I admit that when I saw the film some 20 years ago I did not appreciate the film as I do now. I was missing the forest for the trees. This film does not belong to Burton Taylor Guinness Ustinov Jones or Lillian Gish. It belongs to Greene Glenville and the French cinematographer Henri Decae. I do not imply that Burton was not goodbut George C Scott said one should evaluate a performance by remembering the character more than the actor. It is in that context that I remember the four main characters. Burton's kisses are different here than say in Boom or Cleopatraonly to add detail to the character. Taylor is strangely subdued only to add power to her smoldering role. Guinness gradual unmasking is pathetic yet endearing only to add more substance to the character. Decae's camera captures details that shockse.g. empty drawers in desks to collect bribes public executions of rebels watched by school kids... I am surprised that this film to my limited knowledge has never been taken seriously for what it offersa superb script commendable acting good direction and some fine camerawork.".

Based on a Graham Greene novel it's about the political atmosphere in Haiti while under French rule. It was a box office flop in 1967 and is pretty much forgotten today.That's sad because this is an important film. Since the departure of Duvalier the film has the added historical value it didn't have in 1967. It is another entry in the canon of TaylorBurton collaborations. It also may be the only film in which Alec Guinness Peter Ustinov Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton all appear in together. Plus how can you trash a film that flaunts its' Haiti exteriors so joyfully?The vast Panavision photography will be lost on TV screens especially in the horrific pan and scan format. The best way to see this film is on a big screen and even that may be impossible these days. The title will confuse many most will think it's about comedians in a comedy club but it does have a hidden subtext these people are comedians in a sense. They kid each other endlessly to avoid reality. In that context The Comedians succeeds. It could benefit from some trimming but that's a small complaint. I can't think of anyone else who would even attempt to make such a challenging film in such a chaotic climate.12 out of 4 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "Haiti has been suffering like no other part of the world for decades. The Comedians takes aim at one of its most awful periods the late1960s misrule of Papa Doc Duvalier. The heart is in the right place but the film suffers from its commitment to bear witness to unrelieved misery and hopelessness at the expense of story or believable characterization.Brown Richard Burton is trying futilely to offload his Haitian hotel and make a clean break from a life spent in furtive sex with Martha Pineda Elizabeth Taylor wife of a foreign ambassador Peter Ustinov. Brown doesn't care about politics but politics has a way of caring about him. Soon he finds himself pressed for help by noble rebels fighting a hopeless cause as well as a shady arms salesman Alec Guinness who bites off more than he can chew.One of the more misleadingly titled films ever The Comedians has barely a laugh on offer except for the risible sight of Guinness in drag and blackface somehow sneaking past a couple of suspicious black policemen. Its dire tone is a weight and so is its 150minute running time. With such a great cast and a script by Graham Greene adapted from his own novel the film is never a complete bore but it doesn't engage either. As other reviewers here note it comes off as a kind of muddy replay of Casablanca without that classic's snappy dialogue or sense of hope.Burton and Taylor were of course the couple of the moment when The Comedians came out and the film plays to this shamelessly. The film's first half focuses on their pathetic relationship. Burton's Brown is so jealous of Martha he can't even bear the thought of her spending time with her husband and son. Martha struggles with his growling idiocy because well she's Taylor and he's Burton and it's what audiences were supposed to have wanted.He seems to be coasting on his sullen broody charm while she wrestles with a dicey accent and lack of motivation. Poor Ustinov is reduced to a few moments of coweyed impotent sympathy. At least the film looks great thanks to Henri Deca's sharp cinematography and the sundrenched splendor of Dahomey today Benin which stands in for Haiti rather well. Director Peter Glenville likes too much shots of people talking to each other for long stretches but he works in some sharp transitions which cut the torpor factor down somewhat.The main problem with the film is Greene. He does change the story up some from the novel but leaves in a silly subplot about a couple staying at Brown's hotel who plan to export their vegetarian ideals to Haiti This could be the beginning of our greatest achievement Greene has the husband say to the wife as they step off their ship apropos of nothing only to discover Haiti is a place where dreams go to die. Paul Ford and Lillian Gish add luster to the sterling cast but they slow down the story for more grief about poor Haiti a point the film presses at every turn.Graham also saddles his cast with some bad lines in furtherance of this point. Haiti means hate hate! yells one grieving widow when her husband's body is stolen by some Tontons Macoutes. He lives for them and they die for him Brown muses about Papa Doc.Guinness's character H. O. Jones is another odd duck. If you can't be good be careful he tells Brown at the outset before proceeding to be neither. We discover in time that he's a bit of a fraud as well as a cheat yet for a globetrotting bounder he has no apparent survival skills other than calling on Brown to bail him out on the basis of their shared Englishness. When he begins to win Martha's affections Brown naturally finds new cause for his jealousy.The best part of the movie like others say here is a scene late in the movie where Brown and Jones have a hearttoheart and Jones shows real remorse over a misspent life. Here both actors manage some memorable work and Glenville also keeps things interesting in an understated way by making us wonder about Brown's motives which involves some clever misdirection. It's not quite enough to save the film but it makes it feel like less of a waste.Roscoe Lee Browne and Raymond St. Jacques are also notable in minor roles Browne so minor as a journalist you might miss him except for the way he seems to gracefully speak for a better Haiti without committing himself to anything dangerous. St. Jacques with his crisp bearing and hard glare steals every scene he's in as a nasty captain Concesseur so much so you wish Greene gave him a bit of ambiguity. Instead he just kills a lot and tells Brown white people disgust him because their skin reminds him of a toad's belly.You get the point long ago. Haiti is a bad place. Unfortunately The Comedians never advances much from that position and the result is too often labored if never entirely as hopeless as its message.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie many years ago and it left me cold. When it came up again on cable the combination of the stellar cast  Alec Guinness Richard Burton Peter Ustinov Peter Ford Lillian Gish James Earl Jones Liz Taylor  and a script based on a Graham Greene novel prompted me to give it a second look. Maybe because I'm a lot older now I can appreciate its many qualities. Graham Greene's cynical postCatholic sensibility is clearly in evidence here. The production qualities are high and the story line is engaging. The portrayal of the misery of Haiti and the terror of the Duvalier government with its tontons macoutes secret police is chilling. It is still true today that if you look up Third World Hell Hole in your Funk  Wagnalls there will be a picture of Haiti. The characters are welldrawn. Burton's character Brown  who seems to be missing a first name  is a sardonic cynical and jaded hotel owner who puts one in mind of Rick in Casablanca. His character transformation involving the shedding of his cynicism is very effectively portrayed. Mr.  Mrs. Smith Ford  Gish might have been portrayed to be the slightly silly and naive characters they appear to be but in the end they demonstrate a touching bravery and idealism. The weak spot here is Elizabeth Taylor's Martha Pineda. Her attempt as an ambassador's European wife at an accent is simply ridiculous ranging from French sorta to British to German kinda depending on the scene.

	onyx:emotionText "I saw this movie many years ago and it left me cold. When it came up again on cable the combination of the stellar cast  Alec Guinness Richard Burton Peter Ustinov Peter Ford Lillian Gish James Earl Jones Liz Taylor  and a script based on a Graham Greene novel prompted me to give it a second look. Maybe because I'm a lot older now I can appreciate its many qualities. Graham Greene's cynical postCatholic sensibility is clearly in evidence here. The production qualities are high and the story line is engaging. The portrayal of the misery of Haiti and the terror of the Duvalier government with its tontons macoutes secret police is chilling. It is still true today that if you look up Third World Hell Hole in your Funk  Wagnalls there will be a picture of Haiti. The characters are welldrawn. Burton's character Brown  who seems to be missing a first name  is a sardonic cynical and jaded hotel owner who puts one in mind of Rick in Casablanca. His character transformation involving the shedding of his cynicism is very effectively portrayed. Mr.  Mrs. Smith Ford  Gish might have been portrayed to be the slightly silly and naive characters they appear to be but in the end they demonstrate a touching bravery and idealism. The weak spot here is Elizabeth Taylor's Martha Pineda. Her attempt as an ambassador's European wife at an accent is simply ridiculous ranging from French sorta to British to German kinda depending on the scene. In addition the film makers decided that extra dollops of Rich and Liz's lovemaking scenes would be an added draw not a good idea as they slow down the action and force us to endure listening to Taylor. It's a long movie but it keeps us going to its tragic finale.";

	schema:reviewBody "Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor find themselves together just a year after arguably their best film together Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? Sadly The Comedians is not one of the best films they ever made as a pair nor is it one of the best film adaptations of a Graham Greene novel even though Greene himself penned the screenplay. There are still pleasures to be had from a viewing of The Comedians such as some very strong acting and amazing photography by the great Henri Decae. Plus of course the film is set in a time and place that have been very rarely visited in cinematic terms so the political turmoil of 1960s Haiti lends the film a sense of freshness. Alas the story takes too long to unfold and is done is such a lowkey style that it frequently lapses into tedium. No Graham Greene story should ever be looked upon as tedious.A disillusioned white hotelier named Brown Richard Burton returns to PortauPrince Haiti to save his troubled hotel business. But the ruthless regime of Papa Doc Duvalier has strangled the life out of Haiti and Brown finds himself returning to a country in dire political turmoil. As he steps off the boat Brown witnesses a British visitor named Jones Alec Guiness being seized by officials and dragged away to be beaten. Then a dead body turns up in his hotel swimming pool  a local politician who has made a drunken rant against Papa Doc's regime and been killed by the Tonton Haitian secret police. Brown is determined to keep out of the political troubles but events conspire to drag him into the struggle. The deterioration of his affair with married woman Martha Pineda Elizabeth Taylor has Brown looking for adventure perhaps to impress her but more likely to find something to fill the void in his life when they inevitably break up. He helps the British guy Jones who introduces himself as a soldieroffortunearms dealer and seems to be playing the Haitian government soldiers off against the island's guerillas. Jones is eventually exposed as a compulsive liar a 'nobody' without a shred of military experience. His tall tales have put him in a real dilemma  Papa Doc's men want him dead because they perceive him as a threat the guerrillas want him to supply them with arms something he can't do in their fight for freedom! Brown's involvement with Jones drags him deeper into the struggle forcing him to take a political standpoint and face up to his inner demons.The Comedians suffers from a lot of interrelated subplots that don't work cinematically. In the book these subplots added layers to the story but on film they slow down an already heavygoing narrative making it very hard to plough through the movie. A good example of this is the American couple played by Paul Ford and Lillian Gish  key players in the novel but so peripheral in the film that they might as well have been omitted for the sake of narrative drive. Taylor is also flawed in this film  she flits in and outs of accents her love scenes with Burton seem stifled and her character makes no sense. Burton and Guiness emerge with the acting honours here especially in the fabulously acted scene where Jones confesses his various lies and connivances. The film has memorable music by Laurence Rosenthal and looks terrific throughout thanks to the aforementioned Henri Decae cinematography. But Peter Glenville's direction is remarkably staid and seems virtually at odds with the powerful and urgent themes than underpin the story. Worth a look but it's unlikely you'll come back to the film once you've satisfied your curiosity.".

The lives of the people in Haiti during the regime of President Papa Doc Duvalier are explored through the presence of half a dozen outsiders who find the culture there as strange as most viewers will. Richard Burton plays a Welsh hotel owner who returns to find the government under Duvalier's control and political turmoil for many. He is surrounded by a cast of major stars in secondary roles which includes his reallife wife Elizabeth Taylor as his married mistress Peter Ustinov as Taylor's ambassador husband Alec Guennis as a British Major seemingly in cahoots with the president and for comedy relief the team of Paul Ford and Lillian Gish as a former presidential candidate and his flighty nosy wife. To play the Haitans some of America's best black theatrical actors were cast and they include Cicely Tyson James Earl Jones Roscoe Lee Browne and Raymond St. Jacques. In spite of the presence of all of these stars the film is entirely too long with its focus on details that would fit perfectly into a travelogue but will seem bizarre to standard audiences.Those expecting a LizDick movie will be truly disappointed Her role is superfluous to the plot other than to give Burton a love interest. Lillian Gish's Billie Burke like matron makes references to fellow silent star John Barrymore who allegedly stayed in Burton's hotel. After being paired with Shirley Booth in The Matchmaker Hermoine Gingold in The Music Man and Maureen O'Sullivan in Never Too Late comic character actor Paul Ford adds Gish to his list of eccentric costars. In a sense this seems more the type of movie that Otto Preminger was directing in the mid to late 1960's with its off the wall casting bizarre plot lines and racial tensions. At least with Preminger you could count on a little camp. Sadly that's missing here. Whats not missing is boredom.".

First off I've only seen two movies set in Haiti this one and White Zombie was Live and Let Die in Haiti? that would be three than. So of the movies about Haiti this is the only one that actually addresses life there. I've actually got some relatives that live there and I tell myself when I think of them there is no freakin way I'm ever living in Haiti I don't care how much of a king I'd be there is no freakin way. Was the movie a truthful account? God I hope not but having traveled all over the place something tells me there is probably a lot more truth here than fiction. I've read some reviews here about this being a very boring flick a disaster etc etc well let me just sum up some of the scenes and if that sounds boring than go back to CGI land where you belong. First it looked like a real chicken that this Voodoo priest bites the head off and that looked like real chicken blood squirting from it. Second I know the effect looked a little cheesy but I rarely ever see peoples neck's slit open like James Earl Jones's is in this movie. So you could say that the atmosphere that these whites in Haiti were living in was just a little precarious wouldn't you? I currently live and walk among vast hordes of natives and often am the only white around and occasionally I'll think of a bad situation of me trying to escape a mob so I really was drawn into this flick as Burton stays around because he has nothing else to go to he just stays in this hell. It was just the madness of it all that I found so entertaining and kept me watching than you throw in the 2 graphic especially for the middle 60's! scenes of the chicken and slit throat I was really impressed! If you watching for Liz than you will be disappointed but the scene where Burton tries to get some in her house with her husband downstairs was a good exchange. I think some of these reviews are coming from this bitterness that despite all the advances the world has made you still have a whole hell of a lot of crap holes around the world many with blacks as the majority sad to say and they don't like that being portrayed on film. Add to that a far left couple of characters that are so righteous and disillusioned by pouring money into a vegetarian city that goes nowhere but soaks them of their money and I can see where some who support all that peace and love jive would hate this flick. I like the way the ending is left to us to wonder of Burton's fate I would have hoped he hiked over to the other side of the island and gotten out of that hell hole called Haiti. Good to watch at least once.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Glenville's fondness for TVstyle closeups seems deliberately designed to emphasize the inadequacies in Elizabeth Taylor's performance. The scenes between Taylor and Burton are particularly slow and tedious. At least two of their clinches have even been stepprinted to make them run longer! When they have a chance to strut their stuff the support players fare much better. True they all have far more interesting material to work with although Elizabeth even manages to make one of her scenes with Peter Ustinov boring. Fortunately Guinness delivers one of his best performances. Lillian Gish and Paul Ford are along mainly for laughs and exit halfway through. After their departure the film literally staggers to an inconclusive and unsatisfying conclusion. An effective use of natural locations is about the only strong feature in this dull uninteresting longwinded effort.".

I enjoy watching the onscreen romance between the Burton and Taylor knowing that off screen they were also in love. The movie is a prime time movie even competing with today's movies. The biggest problems with this movie is that it is too long and too predictable. The movie is a bit slow at many points. However I still enjoy watching and listening to the stars in the film.

Meanwhile  the trio is enlisted in a bunch of reapers who go to the Castilian lands to reap under a shimmer sun . Unfortunately  Andrea soon falls in love with the snitch .This is nice picture with good production design by Enrique Alarcn  colorful cinematography by Mario Pacheco and decent interpretations . Bardem's conceptual and political audacity as well as the social critique result to be very evident in this film . Including brief social remarks and social criticism about strikes  unemployment  labouring exploitation  among others . Being first movie from Spain to be nominated for an academy award for Best Foreign Language Film. After national and international hit smashes Muerte De Un Ciclista 55 and Calle Mayor 56  it lets Bardem to write and direct his most ambitious picture   La Venganza or Vengeance . However  resulting in a good film but inferior than precedent ones . Bardem's main purport was to develop the national reconciliation issue  supported by the Communist Party  but the Franquist censorship coerces him and Juan Antonio has to change many things  spoiling his aims . As Bardem has to modify the followings  The original title Los Segadores or The harvesters  so that it was similar to Catalan hymn Els Segadors and the first script was set in 1958  it was changed in 1931 to avoid political intention . This is an ItalianSpanish coproduction  though in Italy was delivered on 1241960 . The main cast is formed by a trio of famous actors  giving passable interpretations as Jorge Mistral  Raf Vallone  though mediocre acting by Carmen Sevilla as a sister of an ex con . Support cast is frankly well  including prestigious secondaries such as Fernando Rey Manuel Alexandre  Jose Prada  Angel Alvarez  Jose Riesgo  Conchita Bautista  Jose Marco Davo  Xan Das Bolas  Rafael Bardem  among others . Furthermore  some ItalianFranch players as Arnaldo Foa  and Louis Seigner .Well produced by Manuel J. Goyanes and powerful producer Cesreo Gonzlez from Suevia Films . Being professionally directed by Juan Antonio Bardem  though it has some flaws  dated elements and doctrinaire style . Bardem deservedly considered one of the best filmmakers of the Spanish cinema . Bardem was a good filmmaker and older brother of Pilar Bardem and son of notorious actors as Rafael Bardem and Matilde Muoz Sampedro . Furthermore  he is uncle of Oscarized Javier Bardem  Carlos Bardem  Mnica Bardem and father of Miguel Bardem . Bardem was an outspoken critic of the Franco regime his political views prevented him from gaining a diploma from the Spanish cinema institute in 1947 . Thereafter he worked as a critic and finally broke into films as writerdirector  being his film debut Esa Pareja Feliz 1951 codirected by Luis Garcia Berlanga . He  subsequently  made Comicos1953 about stage world  a feeling comedy  Felices Pascuas54 and the too much acclaimed Death of a cyclist or Muerte De un Ciclista 1955 about an adultery and its fateful consequences  which won the 1956 Cannes International Critics Award . Other classic films he wrote or directed are the followings  Bienvenido Mr. Marshall codirected by Luis Garcia Berlanga  Sonatas 59 based on Ramn Del Valle Inclan  a rural drama  La Venganza 57  Nunca Pasa Nada63 an ambitious portrayal of provincial life that failed in box office  among others . And  of course  Calle Mayor based on Carlos Arniches's La Seorita Trevelez  it resulted to be the best one  it was voted ninth best Spanish film by professionals and critics in 1996 Spanish cinema centenary and being prized in Festival Of Venice . He had to fight the censorship which didn't admit the some engaging scenes and obligated a determined ending . During the start of filming  student protests in Madrid led to the arrest of director Juan Antonio Bardem a communist in the city of Palencia and carried out by the Brigada Politica Social . He was jailed for a few days and released on the condition that he could not talk about his personal life or beliefs during interviews related to the film . After Bardem's jailing and release he decided to stop early filming in Palencia and shot the remaining of the movie in other cities . The big hit Los Pianos Mecanicos with an international cast led him to European coproductions such as the Wartime  Ultimo Dia De Guerra68 with George Maharis  the Jules Verne adventure La Isla Misteriosa 72 with Omar Shariff  the Giallos Corrupcin De Chris Miller 72 and El Poder Del Deseo 75 with Marisol  Jean Seberg and the Sara Montiel vehicle Varietes70 . With democracy founding  Bardem made again political cinema  such as Siete Dias Enero 78 about Atocha massacre  La Advertencia82 and his final film was Resultado Final97 with Mar Flores . And especially his successful TV adaptation Lorca  La Muerte De Un poeta1987 . La Venganza  rating  Acceptable and passable  essential and indispensable seeing for Spanish cinema fans . Well worth watching .".

He was jailed for a few days and released on the condition that he could not talk about his personal life or beliefs during interviews related to the film . After Bardem's jailing and release he decided to stop early filming in Palencia and shot the remaining of the movie in other cities .

We have all seen these films that boast big names but somehow never fully follow through. Freeway is nothing of the kind. It is a carefully written and delivered retelling of one of our most beloved fairy tales with a extremely dark twist.Reece Witherspoon preLegally Blonde gives a performance that surprised me. I did not realize that she was so capable of bringing this character to life. Her counterpart the illustrious 'Wolf' played by 80s child Keifer Sutherland is yet another powerful force in this film. The two of them nearly carry this film on their shoulders. This is one of those perfect examples of a film that did not have much publicity after its release but has since then obtained 'cult' status through avid viewer's word of mouth. This is definitely a film for all movie critics film buffs and fanatics to gaze at just once. I know there were some poor reviews when it was first released but I am sure that a second viewing would bring this gem back to life.I would also like to add that director Matthew Bright is a film genius. He successfully took a very wholesome and good natured story or that we think and transforms it into the fearsome dark story that it should be. Our society has the consistency of taking dark elements and transforming them into stories for our children. A wolf eats a grandmother in this story  how happy and uplifting is that? I applaud Bright for taking this story and transforming it into a modern day fairy tale. It is gripping fascinating and downright beautiful.If you enjoyed Natural Born Killers and was hoping for a nicer twist this film is your answer. I also suggest that if you couldn't get enough of Freeway that you try to get your hands on the very rare Freeway 2 Confessions of a Trickbaby.

Reminiscent of the films of John Waters it's a satire of such unfunny things as serial killings drug abuse prostitution sexual abuse of underage children prison life random acts of violence and suicide. Like the best Waters Matthew Bright finds the pathos in all of these things shaping the movie into a nihilistic comedy.Reese Witherspoon is absolutely marvelous as her character Vanessa Lutz a sharpwitted white trash girl who makes the best out of every situation she finds herself in. Her mother is a drugaddled prostitute. Her stepfather is a jobless sexually abusive moron who also hits the pipe. Vanessa herself has a history of being in trouble with the law and has trouble reading but she's far from stupid. We never once doubt that she will prevail no matter how desperate her situation becomes. Vanessa is forced to make a move one day when her parents are arrested and a social worker plans on sending Vanessa to another foster home. Unable to face that prospect she gives her social worker the slip and hits the road to search for her grandmother who she has never met and who is not even aware of Vanessa's existence. Vanessa's life takes a detour when her car breaks down and she is picked up by Kiefer Sutherland. She does not know that he is the I5 Killer a pathetic but cunning serial murderer who preys on young women he plucks from the freeway. Unfortunately for him he comes up against the wrong victim when he targets Vanessa. The rest of the story is best left unsaid although Roger Ebert gave away most of the plot in his review of the film from 1996 don't ya just love when he does that?. Bright actually references John Waters several times first by inserting a brief passage that features the opening theme from Pink Flamingos and also by making a plot point out of the fact that Vanessa who is white has a thing for black guys much like Penny Pingleton in Hairspray. The dialogue is often outrageous too. But unlike Waters' early films Freeway is technically wellmade and structurally better. It also features a number of terrific cameos and roles including Brooke Shields as Sutherland's snooty blissfully ignorant wife.Fans of offbeat movies in general might really love Freeway while others should probably approach it with a strong stomach.".

The performance delivered by Reese Witherspoon was not only great it was startlingly great and the best thing I've seen her do. Each turn in the story hit me like a slap in the face each new character was like a gift but Reese Witherspoon playing the queen of trailer park trash was done like a symphony. Fantastic!";

	schema:headline " I don't think this is how The Brothers Grimm envisioned Little Red Riding Hood...";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on the classic Grimm Brothers tale Little Red Riding Hood Freeway is the disjointed and frankly weird odyssey following a young girl on the way to her grandmother's home. The film begins much like any other hitchhiking film with a young girl being picked up by a slightly sinister driver. However you won't be able to predict where it's going to go from there as Freeway continually puts its characters in absurd situations and delivers the unexpected. The plot doesn't exactly adhere to the story of Little Red Riding Hood and after the basics have been laid down it's basically anyone's game right down to the gripping and hilarious climax. The film sees Reese Witherspoon's juvenile delinquent being picked up by Kiefer Sutherland's child psychologist after fleeing from her home when her mother and step father are arrested. After telling the psychologist of her relationship with her step father she soon realises that he's enjoying what she's saying a little too much and it's not long before she asks him if he's the infamous I5 killer and he doesn't do anything to convince her he's not...Freeway doesn't introduce any characters that are particularly likable and all are guilty to a degree. Most audience members will be on the side of Witherspoon's character as although she certainly has personality problems she's great fun to watch and her twisted logic isn't usually far from being spot on! Witherspoon got one of her best roles in this film and really does carry it despite her young age. Kiefer Sutherland stars alongside her and it's rather odd seeing him in the psycho role after getting so used to him being Jack Bauer in 24. He does do it great however. Perhaps the best thing about this film is the pitch black humour that goes hand in hand brilliantly with the absurdity of the piece. The plot is really freewheeling and the film jumps from road thriller to prison drama to the court room in the blink of an eye and this helps to ensure that the audience is always kept on their toes. This film won't appeal to people that don't like their movies to be pitch black and unpleasant but anyone who enjoys a good does of absurdity shouldn't hesitate to track this film down!".

Her Vanessa Lutz is brazen coarse violent manipulative and seemingly doomed no matter which way she turns. But at the end of the day of every day she remains her own person and nothing can intimidate or stop her. Witherspoon seems to live and breathe this demanding role with never a hint of 'acting a part'  which is to say she is doing some very fine acting indeed. Vanessa Lutz is a role like Forrest Gump though even more challenging where one tiny step out of character would spoil the whole thing. But Miss Witherspoon never misses.Plus it was great to see Kiefer Sutherland play a smarmy goodytwoshoes psychopathic villain. Much more fun than his trained chipmunk limpwrist tendentiousness in 24. I have seen no evidence that this man can actually act but he really does not need to here. When he first appeared on screen I thought 'Oh no this movie's over.' But soon I discovered to my delight that he he had been cast precisely for his pathetic loser quality.For some reason IMDB classifies Freeway as a 'crimedrama' which mostly misses the point. It is a diabolical black comedy with lots of violent action some of it realistic but most of it wonderfully absurd. All in all it earns a solid 810 for being funny and satisfying a movie which I would happily watch again.".

Setting off to visit her grandmother she agrees to a lift from the kind and well spoken Bob Wolverton Sutherland only to find that he's not as nice as she first thought. He in turn is in for a big surprise himself since Vanessa is more than capable of looking after herself.Twisted and richly humorous Matthew Bright's movie oozes originality and quite frankly deserves to be better appreciated never mind better known! Going into it for a first time completely oblivious to its structure will arguably aid the experience. Suffice to say that the less known about it prior to viewing it the better. All I have to say is that it's violent sweary and contains very sexually explicit dialogue so if those things are likely to offend then perhaps stay away from it. But what if I offer up that those things are dealt with a satirical bent? That the tough scenes and some of them are very tough are basis to a caustic narrative about social hypocrisy and the often stupidity of the law? Interested? You should be because once viewed you're unlikely to forget it. It's no surprise to see Oliver Stone's name etched onto the production credits since this very much feels like a dirty second cousin to his Natural Born Killers. I'd argue that here we have the better acted film with Witherspoon and Sutherland giving virtuoso performances with admirable support coming from the likes of Bodison Shields and Murphy.One of the most undervalued film's of the 90s?

For its time it is a HUGE eyeopener and an outstanding attempt to recreate the fairy tale in a suburban fashion. It is simply riveting and very satisfying in terms of plot action and character. I have never seen Reese Witherspoon kick so much ass ever. I don't understand why she didn't get any Oscar buzz for this one. This performance completely tops her part in Walk the Line. She is more than amazing in this film. You really don't wanna mess with her. She is capable of almost anything after what's been done to her. We still sympathize with her though because she's still compassionate and cares for what is right. She has a set of principles that she won't let anyone tread on. Being more of a Punisher she is that strong heroine that uses her sense of justice to subdue those who wrong her but at the same time she's all about instinct and guts she isn't your Lara Croft or your fancy Black Widow. She just acts on pure instinct of what is right and she understands that most of the time reality is screwed up and doesn't care for what is wrong or right. I was left speechless at the sheer simplicity with which she conveys so much pain anger and most of all strength. At the same time I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw what she could do. At the beginning of the movie you can't picture her as that tough. But by the end of it even those cops were smiling at her thinking 'Okay let's never upset this one or we'll get our asses whooped!' As for Sutherland wow he can play a real creep when he wants to and be good at it too. His facial expressions and his gestures tell everything you need to know about him as a killer. And at the beginning when he's playing the good guy he's so believable you know right away he's sure to be off his bonkers. I have to admit though he's a tad underplayed. There's not enough focus on him. Also I was expecting a little bit more from him but Reese made up for whatever was missing. As a side note Brittany Murphy is another nice touch to this movie. I have seen this kind of performance before but I think she made it personal as in she made you believe that she was the one going through all of that. I just wish she could have played more parts like this one but I guess we'll never see that happening now...I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see Reese Witherspoon show her acting props. I really miss this side of her. Now she's more into sweet sugary indie movies which aren't all bad they just don't give her much to work with and waste some of her huge potential. Oh and that accent of hers needs to take front stage right now it's adorable! Go watch this movie and you won't regret it!".

	schema:reviewBody "The directorial debut of the obviously multitalented Matthew Bright turned out one of the coolest movies of the entire 90's decade a witty and sometimes truly original Indiefilm with some genuine 70's exploitation trademarks. The story is a very personal and dared interpretation of the famous Little Red Riding Hood fairytale transposed from the woods to present day California and featuring more appropriate menaces like prostitution serial killers drug addiction and child abuse. In her most fabulous performance ever her recent brilliant portrayal of June Carter in Walk the Line not included Reese Witherspoon stars as an illiterate and very unlucky teenager stuck in the lowest social class with a streetwalking mother and a sexhungry stepfather. When welfare officers once again try to put her in a foster family she hopes to flee to her grandmother but ends even deeper in hell. She's offered a ride by a seemly caring psychologist who turns out a sadistic murderer that is difficult to beat! Freeway works as a disturbing thriller but also as a tongueincheek black comedy that illustrates human decay from a teenager's perspective. There are quite a lot of major plot holes in the script and some sequences  especially in the second half of the film  are a bit redundant but Matthew Bright keeps it all very interesting with a fast pace and stylish art direction. Apart from Witherspoon and the always adequate Kiefer Sutherland great acting talents can be found in the supportive cast like Dan Hedaya Amanda Plummer Michael T. Weiss and Brittany Murphy. Even Brooke Shields is amazing in the last role you'd ever expect her to play! Danny Elfman's unique and quite petrifying musical score also contributes in making Freeway one of the most sensational postPulp Fiction thrillers and definitely a future classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a brilliant take on Little Red Riding Hood that's extremely well made with fantastic story telling and an incredible one of a kind performance from Reese Witherspoon!. All the characters are wonderful and Kiefer Sutherland is superb as the crazy villain plus Reese Witherspoon is simply incredible in this!. It really is often bizarre at times but in a very good way and it's really unpredictable throughout plus the finale is especially great!. The ending is quite funny and quite clever and I felt it had some great dark humor in it as well plus Amanda Plummer did very well as Vanessa's mother the junkie!. I loved the wolfgirl animation thing at the opening credits and this is brilliantly written as well! plus I still can't get over Reese's incredible performanceI mean I love her she's my favorite actress but I had no clue she could could do that tough girl stuff and pull it of so perfectly!. The conversation with Bob Kiefer Sutherland and Vanessa Reese in the van is really disturbing and a bit uncomfortable but very engaging and the score while weird is very good plus I feel this movie is way way too underrated!.A lot of people complained this was too violent and sadistic I have to disagree and while it is extremely violent and sadistic at times it also has a fantastic story and your able to feel sympathy for Vanessa plus I just loved how Reese kicked people's asses throughout the movie!. This movie really proves Reese's incredible versatility! and Kiefer Sutherland had some fantastic make up as he was horribly disfigured! plus it's often very suspenseful and funny at times as well.One of the funniest moments in the film for me is when Reese kicks this black detective's ass for calling her a whore and the dialog was excellent plus Dan Hedaya surprised me here by giving a really good performance. This movie is definitely an acquired taste as it won't sit well with some viewers and I feel this movie is going to become a classic in the future! plus all the characters are extremely likable except Brooke Shields.I couldn't stand Shield's character she grated the hell out of me and I feel this should be higher then 6.6 plus there are plenty of shocking and disturbing moments especially the one involving Reese and Brittany Murphy in the prison!. I also never knew Reese could be this vicious and fight like that and it's a shame that this didn't make much money because great films like these are not getting the credit they deserve instead it's always Lord of the rings or Harry Potter etc etcplus it was creepy how Kifer Sutherland's change in character happened just like that!. Another one of my favorite moments is when Reese gives this guy hell and locks him in the trunk since he was only going to pay 5! and it would be cool if they made an actual official sequel for this plus it also had two cool fight scenes one in the prison the other at the end. This is a brilliant take on Little Red Riding Hodd that's extremely well made with fantastic storytelling and incredible one of a kind performance from Reese Witherspoon and if you haven't seen it do so immediately you shouldn't regret it!.The Direction is fabulous!. Matthew Bright does a fabulous! job here with wonderful camera work awesome angles and lots of other great shots as well plus he kept the film at an extremely fast pace. The Acting is incredible. Reese Witherspoon is incredibly gorgeous and is amazing as always she gives one of a kind performance here as she is hilarious wonderfully sadistic feisty tough and i'm with a lot of people on this one this is one of her absolute best performances! and I just loved the way she handled herself in situations she was incredible! and really shocked me overall that she could play this type of character Reese Rules!!!!!!!!!!. Kiefer Sutherland is outstanding and wonderfully twisted as the disfigured sicko he often gave me the creeps and played one of the sickest villains ever I was extremely impressed!. Wolfgang Bodison and Dan Hedaya are great as the two detectives I liked them. Amanda Plummer is excellent as the Junkie mother and was just utterly convincing. Brooke Shields is great as the bitchas I couldn't stand her she did her job extremely well. Brittany Murphy has a really weird but fascinating character I really liked her. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall if you haven't seen it please do so immediately you shouldn't regret it!.  out of 5".

Sure the scenes with Kiefer in the car are humorous but that's all ruined when they turned him into a cartoon figure as well.

She's strong powerful empathetic and likeable as the wayward teen looking for her grandmother. Keifer Sutherland also has a strong role with some of my other favorite performances being from Britany Murphy as a completely transformed and nearly unrecognizable pyromaniac lesbian delinquent. Another great performance is Michael T. Weiss from the TV series Pretender as a complete crackhead and Brook Shields as the wife of Keifer Sutherland's character.

	schema:reviewBody "I know it may seem ridiculous to some but actually even after all these years now well into 2012 this is still a film to watch and no one could have delivered the key role more perfectly than Reese Witherspoon.

Absolutely yes. Do characters like that portrayed by Sutherland the predatory pedophile sociopath who appears to be so acceptably normal to the outside world? Absolutely yes as recent history has shown only too clearly.On the surface this may have appeared to be a sort of whacky creepy crime thriller but actually if one actually takes the time to watch this film there is much more to this than the ad copy may have suggested at the time.It is still currently viable to this very day . . . has stood the test of time.And it is absolutely one of Reese's best ever performances.Sadly her more recent work has sort of flattened out into much less risky complex roles but hey a great actress she is.".

The main character of this story is sassy without being obnoxious smart without being overly booked learned and likable even though she does bad things. Kiefer Sutherland gives an amazing performance as a serial killer who becomes a victim and is even lauded as a hero. The story has a biting edge to it but without losing its strength as a satire. The main character Vanessa is wonderfully portrayed as both a perpetrator and victim. It is the duality of this character that makes this movie especially interesting. She is bad but also nice she is nasty but also vulnerable. Three cheers for Reese Witherspoon. This movie succeeds as a parity of action movies and a strong dramatization of the degenerate side of modern society.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lilian Harvey was a European star who truly did get lost in translation. She was one of Germany's top musical stars even though she was English her father was a diplomat but when she was bought to Hollywood because of the success of Der Kongress Tanze the timing couldn't have been worse. Her fey romanticism was completely out of step with 42nd Street and Brother Can You Spare a Dime depression reality and her films My Lips Betray and My Weakness were flops. But in the Germany of the early 30s she and leading man Willy Fritsch an extremely versatile star who had the misfortune to be Hitler's favourite actor were dazzlingly popular and they positively sparkled in this movie. It was a huge international success and was helped by Lil Dagover as a glamorous sophisticate the wonderful Conrad Veidt as the Machiavellan Metternich and a delightful score that captured the free spirit of Vienna of the 1810s.Charell used the Vienna congress only as a background to the real story of Christel Harvey a kittenish glove sales girl who is causing an uproar because of her unconventional methods of advertising she throws flower bouquets advertising her shop The Beautiful Shepherdess to all visiting dignitaries as they ride by in their coaches. She is determined to do the same to the Tsar Alexander Fritsch of Russia  unfortunately the townsfolk think it is a bomb!! a hilarious sequence where the poor little bouquet is kicked and stamped on!!! and Christel finds herself in prison facing 25 beatings of the cane on her naked behind!!! The Tsar has a double also played by Fritsch Ulralsky a good natured buffoon who stands in for him at public appearances. The real Tsar gets Christel pardoned. Again a funny sequence where the prison guard is pretty upset at being stopped from beating her behind by the Tsar  his face says it all!! Christel and the Tsar go to a beer garden and there is a beautiful rousing song Das Muss ein Stueck Von Himmel sein Wien und der Wein  it is such a pretty popular song and it originated in this movie. This is followed by the spectacular Polovetsian Dances by Borodin.The highlight to me is Christel's ride in an open carriage to the castle she has been given by the Tsar. Her happiness and emotion come out in the song It Only Happens Once in a Lifetime. The refrain is picked up by people along the journey farmers flower sellers children in the fields. While all this is going on Metternich who doesn't want the Tsar at the congress enlists the help of the seductive Countess Lil Dagover to charm the other Tsar from his duties. The film ends on a bitter sweet note  the Tsar returns to Russia and Christel to her ever faithful sweetheart Pepi.It is just an extraordinarily joyous musical  at the end there is also a dance of the chairs. This movie was popular world wide  it had a sumptuous almost fairy tale appeal and hit American shores when cinema owners were trying to lure patrons in with signs that said This is Not a Musical. Americans had overdosed on tons and tons of often substandard musicals  these frothy European bonbons proved there was a place for musical perfection. Director Eric Charell was also bought to America on the strength of this movie but his only directorial credit in the States was Caravan 1934 and it wasn't very good.Highly Highly Recommended.".

We are suddenly taken into some sort of sub plot with strange overtures. The judge finds her guilty and sentences her to 25 blows of the rod across her bare posterior! Presumably this was the standard punishment for misdemeanours back in 19th century Germany? The next scene sees Christel in the punishment room  you can tell this by the way the walls are adorned with a huge selection of different size canes. A leering young man who clearly enjoys his work selects the prescribed size rod and proceeds to secure Christel over a bench with the use of a large strap. Once in place he lifts her dress when..... see the film and find out! The remake of this film in 1956 did include a punishment scene but it was done in a far less provocative style.".

The director and writers are probably not too known anymore today but is one of their most known works for sure and the cast with Harvey Fritsch Veidt and Dagover offers some names that are still pretty popular today almost a century later. The title already gives away that music is a crucial component in this one here and looking at the year when this came out you will see that it is from the early days of sound film and honestly for that it is still quite an achievement as the audio side including the songs with lyrics and orchestra is easily the most memorable aspect of this 1.5hour movie. Das gibts nur einmal is probably the highlight here and it's nice the song got featured at the very end again once more. As for the story I was not too impressed. The actors are solid and try their best to elevate the mediocre script but it never really catches my attention here. I also think with all the pompous uniforms and dresses this blackandwhite flick would have been infinitely better with color but I guess you can't blame the makers for the fact that technology wasn't ready enough by 1931. Colors like in these Sderbaum Nazi movies from one decade later would have been amazing here. Anyway the movie was successful enough to be remade on several occasions and I already mentioned the other works from the same time. For example Harvey Veidt and Dagover also appear in the English version but Fritsch is replaced by another actor. But contentswise I have little to no interest to check out any of these other version as I found this original already pretty forgettable. I have to give it a thumbsdown as this one did not get me dancing at all. Not recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is very obvious that t.c.m. is politically correct against showing any German films classicsmade before and during and after the Nazi's except for those approved by their hired corporate film reviewers. Yes my fine fans of classic films unless c.e.o's change as well as staff you'll never see this played on t.c.m. T.c.m with the possible aid of Leanard Maltin possiblythey had this film  along with other of Conrads German speaking films banned on their August Summers under the stars tribute to Conrad Viedt. So I had to commit an act of defiance. I bought it from war films. They got free publicity from t.c.m. Erik Charrel did escape Germany and although did not make it to the top in Hollywood unlike G.W. Pabst he did find work. Two big German stars show up together but as second roles who first appear together in The Cabinette of Dr. Kilgari. Yes Conrad Viedt as Prince Metternich.Lil Dagover as the countess. Conrad plays a very devious prince worthy of cable broadcasting . He styles his hair and projects a subtle version of the zombie from The cabinet of D.r. Kilgari. Another thing one of the waltzesnear the end of the moviethat music was reused added song lyrics in Germany's first talking color feature  Women make better diplomats1942. I also believe that the waltz congress dance was altered and re staged by r.k.o. in the 1935 Technicolor featureBecky Sharp. I might be wrong at that but it sure looks similar.But the main stars were  what use to be nowBen Afflect and Jennifer Lopez of Germany in the 1930's. Lillian Harvey and Willy Fritz.

Yes my fine fans of classic films unless c.e.o's change as well as staff you'll never see this played on t.c.m. T.c.m with the possible aid of Leanard Maltin possiblythey had this film  along with other of Conrads German speaking films banned on their August Summers under the stars tribute to Conrad Viedt. So I had to commit an act of defiance. I bought it from war films. They got free publicity from t.c.m. Erik Charrel did escape Germany and although did not make it to the top in Hollywood unlike G.W. Pabst he did find work. Two big German stars show up together but as second roles who first appear together in The Cabinette of Dr. Kilgari. Yes Conrad Viedt as Prince Metternich.Lil Dagover as the countess. Conrad plays a very devious prince worthy of cable broadcasting . He styles his hair and projects a subtle version of the zombie from The cabinet of D.r. Kilgari. Another thing one of the waltzesnear the end of the moviethat music was reused added song lyrics in Germany's first talking color feature  Women make better diplomats1942. I also believe that the waltz congress dance was altered and re staged by r.k.o. in the 1935 Technicolor featureBecky Sharp. I might be wrong at that but it sure looks similar.But the main stars were  what use to be nowBen Afflect and Jennifer Lopez of Germany in the 1930's. Lillian Harvey and Willy Fritz.
