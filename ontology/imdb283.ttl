But this particular time I was alone and not sitting in the last row of the balcony. It touched me on the deepest level and I always thought of it since that first viewing. Now I'm 63 and the movie still haunts me. So I rate it in my personal Top Ten movies. I hope others take the time to see it. Perhaps others will view it. The Story line just blows me away! It begins with Anna falling in love with a soldier during the war and a passionate love affair begins in the midst of crisis. As the relationship turns into deep love the soldier gets reassigned. Anna is in crisis after her lover leaves. She is severely depressed and becomes a loose woman and begins Carousing Drinking etc. after she receives word that her true love has been killed in action. Given this news she decides to enter the Catholic convent to atone for her sinful past. Well I've already told to much but This website insists on at least 10 lines. O will tell no more hope I have piqued the interest of another Romantic to watch this BW 1951 epic but I will not reveal the ending. So I hope this is enough to fulfill the requirements.

Seeing her in Morte a Venezia Death in Venice by Visconti 1971 where she plays Tadzio's mother an extremely refined polish countess it's almost impossible to associate her with the voluptuos woman in Anna and Bitter Rice. Her polished looks are even more glorious than when she was a sex bomb.Same thing in Gruppo di famiglia in un interno 1974 again by Visconti with Burt Lancaster.A true star that unfortunately had such a sad ending but then as Dorothy Parker put it when defending before Louis B.

No reasonable expenses spared. Not only was the Studio tackling The Bard for the first time in a major way but the extreme celebrity of the original play guaranteed a great deal of public attention. Several choice roles were available for MGM's brightest stars and the part of Juliet would be the desire of every young actress on the lot.Almost predictably the role went to Norma Shearer who as Irving Thalberg's wife could almost pick  choose what she or Irving wanted. However it should be stated at once that she is splendid in the role. Sweetly demure innocent apprehensive fiercely protective of her love  recklessly heedless of her fate  she is Shakespeare's heroine.She is matched by Leslie Howard's Romeo. A bit giddy at first with puppy love he quickly matures into a tender lover  vengeful killer finally willing like Shearer to forego all of his Catholic teaching and commit selfmurder thus dooming himself to Perdition.Although decades too old for their roles Juliet was 12 Miss Shearer 34 Romeo about 16 Mr. Howard was 43 they understand and speak their lines much more beautifully  proficiently than any teenager. Shakespeare's lines are really verse of a high order and demands skill  maturity. Howard  Shearer certainly have no problem there. Nor were they the only members of the cast whose ages were rather past the prime.In his only feature length Shakespearean film John Barrymore amply displays his celebrated talent in a bravura performance as an aging sottish Mercutio. Barrymore understood the character thoroughly and he turns this strange brilliant man into one of the film's chief treasures. Interestingly much of his dialogue is rather scatological  gross but being Shakespeare it seems to have flown under the radar of the Hays Office.Edna May Oliver steals nearly every scene she's in as Juliet's waspish eccentric Nurse. Basil Rathbone makes a fiery insolent Tybalt. Reginald Denny adds a touch of distinction in the throwaway role of Benvolio while wonderful old Sir C. Aubrey Smith  Violet Kemble Cooper are colorful as Juliet's parents.At first blush Andy Devine seems an odd choice for a Shakespearean production but he is very competent as the Nurse's simpleminded servant.Somewhat lost in this excellent cast is English actor Ralph Forbes in the rather thankless role of the County Paris. His is a somewhat sad story. Although replete with talent  charm he still never quite reached the top echelons of stardom. He would have made a great Romeo.Movie mavens will spot Katherine DeMille as the fair Rosaline her cousin Agnes de Mille was the film's choreographer and Ian Wolfe as the impoverished apothecary both uncredited.The film has wonderful production values  the sets costumes and background score borrowing themes from Tchaikovsky all of the highest quality. For a small chuckle watch closely during Juliet's dance at the Capulet ball  one of the dancers behind her steps on her dress hem and nearly trips. It's very fast but worth catching.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am sick and stayed home from work and TCM was having a Shakespeare festival. Having never heard of the 1936 version of this play I decided to give it a whirl even though I am not a Leslie Howard fan. Well I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Even though I knew the actors were too old for their roles turns out they were even older than I thought! their delivery was great which is important when you are delivering the Bard's lines verbatim for the most part. Even if you couldn't catch the literal meaning of the words the actors provided plenty of nonverbal context for you to pick things up.I thought Norma Shearer was going to be awful at first as one other commentary has mentioned her first scene makes her look a little too mindlessly sweet and giddyalmost like the look is plastered on her facebut she really came through in the end. When she had to amp up the emotion she did especially considering the Hayes Code was now being enforced.I have to concur that one of the best character acting jobs I have seen in thirties cinema is by the lady who plays Juliet's nurse her name escapes me. She switches from broad comedy to contemplation effortlessly. Basil Rathbone is appropriately vile oily and relentless. I would have liked to have seen a little more of him on screen. And I had no idea that Barrymore's turn as Mercurito was so controversial until I read the other comments here. His approach may be an eccentric idiosyncratic one but it is absolutely riveting although I CAN believe he was in his cups when filming itwhich somehow makes it work all the more.I do agree that there may be a whiff of the effeminate running through the major male characters I had to chuckle when Romeo says his love for Juliet has made him effeminate but that didn't ruin the picture for me at all. The sets are great. Though limited they are attractive and the shots are well thought out. SMALL SPOILERS I found the crypt where the final sword fight takes place something right out of a Universal horror movie and somewhat reminiscent of Fritz Lang too.A modern audience may find this version of the play a little deliberate but I thought the Franco Zeffereti version once you get past the novelty of its modern approach to sex and passion dull at its heart and this is much better than seeing John Luguzamo brandishing a weapon. Check it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "For years I put off watching this version of Shakespeare's classic love story knowing that all the main players were about thirty years too old for their roles. Finally when the film came on late on night I decided to take a look because I do admire the work of so many of the players.Provided you can put aside the problems of the ages of the actors the result is a very pleasant surprise. The biggest surprise for me was the performance of Norma Shearer  I've always liked her work but considered her rather lightweight for Shakespeare. Not so  she delivered her lines with a great feel for the style and pace and was as delightful and open a Juliet as one could wish. Her age became irrelevant this was a young girl new to love completely swept off her feet and ready to surrender all  for the first time.Leslie Howard was also comfortable with the Shakespearean dialogue if slightly lacking the boyish passion we rightly expect to see. He was more the slightly older suitor taken by surprise with the fresh appeal of his Juliet but ready to cast aside previous attachments to pursue and win her. His lovely voice delivered the lines with ease and fluency.John Barrymore's Mercutio was much more the ageing playboy than the dashing young blade but his sure touch with the dialogue showed clearly why he was considered the preeminent Shakespearean actor of his day in America. His delivery of the Queen Mab speech was a delight. His body was way too old but his spirit lacked nothing.Flora Robson came near to stealing most of her scenes as she so often did and Basil Rathbone was fully at home in the role of Tybalt fine performances from these two as we would expect from their backgrounds.It was to my mind rather overproduced with the actors in danger of being lost in the expansive sets but remembering that had these actors been performing on stage we wouldn't bat an eyelid at their ages they provide us with an engrossing experience and deliver a play that even the experts couldn't fault.".

	schema:headline " No Tale More Tragically Told";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite the fact we have a 47 year old Romeo a 36 year old Juliet and a 54 year old Mercutio George Cukor's production for MGM of Romeo and Juliet manages to entertain and well.Of course these protagonists are all teenagers but these players have all played romantic parts in an age when romance was not something to be cynical about and they do fit their roles well. No Romeo was ever more dashing than Leslie Howard or a Juliet as passionate as Norma Shearer.John Barrymore as Mercutio is a bit of an exception. I look at him and I think of another Shakespearean character who simply doesn't want to grow up and spends his time with the young blades of his day at the tavern. That would be Falstaff in Henry IV in both parts and if you think of Barrymore's Mercutio in that way his interpretation makes a lot of sense.My favorite in this film has always been Tybalt and Basil Rathbone plays him with fire and passion. Rathbone got an Academy Award nomination the first of two for Best Supporting Actor in the first year Supporting Actor Awards were given out. He lost however to Walter Brennan in Come and Get It. He's just spoiling for a fight with some Montagues and in the end he unfortunately gets one.Romeo and Juliet is insightful into the Italy of the times. Italy was a geographical expression not a nation. In fact it was ruled mostly by the German entity the Holy Roman Empire. But inside the empire and out it was a succession of petty states constantly at war with each other. Sometimes the causes of the wars were long forgotten but the hostilities took on a life of their own.Right down to a couple of wealthy families in the small town of Verona where the prince there has his hands full trying to keep the Montague and Capulet feud from spilling over into violence every time some of them meet in his town. With this background a young prince of Montague just getting over another bad romance and a princess of Capulet whose father has her slated to marry another meet and fall in love. Even when they find out their respective pedigrees it makes no difference.In fact the idea that love can bridge all barriers is what I believe makes Romeo and Juliet as popular as it is. It's a lesson people and nations could learn.Norma Shearer got an Oscar nomination for playing Juliet but lost to Luise Rainer in The Great Ziegfeld as Best Actress. George Cukor and the film itself also were up but lost for best director and best picture.Andy Devine plays the small part of Peter a Capulet servant and I'm sure you're wondering what Andy Devine was doing in Shakespeare. So did he when he was cast in the part. The story goes that he went to George Cukor and told him he hadn't foggiest idea what he was doing in a classic Shakespeare play he'd never done anything like this. Cukor supposedly told him that was to his credit and that he would be the only member of the cast who would not be telling him how to direct the film. Turned out Cukor was right but the film got made.And that's definitely for the better.".

Shearer's eager innocence and Howard's refinement fit together well and although they are clearly not the teenage characters of the original their romance is believable and convincing in itself.The other roles include some nice casting. Reginald Denny as the loyal Benvolio Basil Rathbone as the hardhearted Tybalt and Edna May Oliver as Juliet's bustling nurse are all enjoyable to watch. But the highlight of the cast is John Barrymore who steals every scene as the funloving illfated Mercutio a character who is wellsuited to Barrymore's strengths. It's a blessing that at least one of Barrymore's numerous Shakespearean roles was captured in a film for posterity.The script abridges many of the scenes for cinematic purposes and it does well in fleshing out the basic story with the duels festivities and other events at times also dramatizing developments that in the original text are only mentioned by the characters. Overall it is a wellconceived wellexecuted and enjoyable movie version of the famous story.".

The music is lovely despite being stolen from more classical stuff the settings are perfectly in tune the verse is spoken with some feeling and inspiration. Why this version doesn't get seen more often I don't know not even on video in the UK.".

The music is lovely despite being stolen from more classical stuff the settings are perfectly in tune the verse is spoken with some feeling and inspiration. Why this version doesn't get seen more often I don't know not even on video in the UK.";

	schema:headline " The Best of Cinema's ROMEO AND JULIETs";
	schema:reviewBody "This is quite simply the best version of Shakespeare's beloved tragic drama that has ever hit the screen. A quintessential problem with the play is that its characters are not at all wellsuited to film. The stage allows middleaged experienced actors to play the parts for the distance between an audience and actor on the stage can supply all necessary illusion. The intimacy of the camera makes a demand however either sacrifice this understanding for youth or sacrifice the youth for understanding. The title characters are supposedly meant to be only in their midteens but to successfully portray them an experienced mentality is needed and so it is imperative that the latter sacrifice be made. On film rarely does the depth the two characters require come forth instead substituted with this youthful energy. This has allowed plenty of young ageappropriate actors to deliver perfectly horrible performances as the young lovers. When Franco Zeferelli produced his overrated version of this tale in the 60s he cast Olivia Hussey and Juliet and Leonard Whitting as Romeo...and the two made Romeo and Juliet teenagers with no sense of real love and instead horny teenage lust. By casting Norma Shearer around 36 and Leslie Howard over 40 as the two MGM lost the supreme youth but gained a nearperfect asset of understanding of the characters. Shearer's delivery is perfect particularly in the spinetingling rendition of Juliet's deathcontemplation monologue just before she takes the poison. Leslie Howard nearly matches her with his Romeo throwing some lines at the audience in a totally new fresh and unexpected way. Edna May Oliver perfectly captures Shakespeare's Nurse filling her with both bawdy humor and genuine care for Juliet's wellbeing. As Tybalt a role cut down from the original length but nonetheless impressive Basil Rathbone is astonishing he earned a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his work here. Also of note is John Barrymore whom I have read was at times totally ossified while filming his scenes. His age really shows and he is no longer the leading Baron from Grand Hotel but his controversial performance is if not to all minds good at least totally engrossing. He was at a time the most celebrated of all Shakespearean stage actors and this film marks his only completely recorded performance in a sound film of the Bard's work this makes the film further noteworthy. To add to this pedigree cast MGM put their top technical men on the job. Adrian and Cedric Gibbons perfectly capture the look and flavor of the play with their elegant costumes and sets. The art deco sleek look ingeniously blends modern architecture with what is expected from Shakespeare's day. The camerawork is brilliant also and Herbert Stothart's blend of Tchaikalvski's haunting Love Theme and original music creates just the perfect musical score. All of these elements combine to create the first truly great Shakespearean film adaptation and also one of the best films of the era period. Far superior to Zeferelli's version and any other one I've seen George Cukor's Romeo and Juliet is another masterpiece from one of the alltime great directors who helmed such classic wellregarded productions as Dinner at Eight David Copperfield The Philadelphia Story and Adam's Rib.".

I'm assuming that most people know the basic plot and have seen other versions of the film if this is not the case you may want to stop reading and keep the surprise for viewing.This version is faithful if not to the exact order of all the dialogue then to the acts and scenes written by Shakespeare. For those teachers that are looking for a version that explains how the letter from Friar Lawrence never reaches Romeo and the reaction of the local populace to Plague this is the version that does it very well. Not only do we learn why Friar John never gets to Romeo but we also get the death duel between Romeo and Paris a scene that has been cut out of every other version I've seen. Plus we get the closing moment of peace between the families. However the death of Lady Montague is omitted.The movie leaves a little to be desired by modern audiences and the typical class of high school freshman many need some heavy prep work to get them ready to view black and white and old as something other than lame. But I think that segments of the film would be well worth showing to the class and viewed as a treat and not a torture when it's not the whole product being shoved down in one lump.I recommend checking it out as an additional resource to add a balanced movie perspective to the characters Shakespeare created. The main problem with it is the age of the actors playing the parts of all these young people. Leslie Howard is 40 years old. Norma Shearer must be of a similar age and it shows in some of the scenes. The age of the people supposedly playing teenagers does strain credibility and at times the acting leaves a lot to be desired. They don't convincingly play passion. You can chalk the overall feeling of muted emotion to the era because at times the emotions do come through brilliantly.".

That would be a pleasure for those who knew the play but a bane for those who didn't.  Shakespeare's spoken dialogue isn't very easy to understand. Like any foreign language you learned a little bit in school you can translate written material and get the gist of what is going on but try deciphering normal speech in that language and you will be lost. I had a difficult time understanding some of the speeches almost nothing that John Barrymore was saying  they flew by me too fast.  On the other hand I studied Hamlet and Macbeth in school and relish watching movie versions of those plays.  Still I enjoyed this film since I knew the general story and there were sections that didn't tax my knowledge of Shakespearean English.  Some of the lines were beautiful.  I never new that the expression starcrossed lovers was Shakespeare's.  Edna May Oliver's comedy was superbly played and the acting of the rest of the cast was excellent.  The title characters were supposed to be teenagers so that both Leslie Howard at 54 and Norma Shearer at 31 were a bit old for their parts but that was a minor point. My advice to anyone wishing to watch this film  read the play first!".

	schema:reviewBody "This version of Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET was very famous in its day and a number of critics that I greatly admire continue to praise it even now. But I must sound a dissenting note although it has its charms I personally found the film somewhat difficult to sit through due to the age of the cast. On the stage Shakespeare's starcrossed lovers are usually played by mature actors in full command of both Shakespearean language and their own art and the physical distance between the stage and the audience allows the cast to create the illusion of youth. But the camera is merciless particularly in close up and this film production presents us with the middleaged Leslie Howard Norma Shearer John Barrymore and Basil Rathbone in roles that would be better served on the screen by much younger players.To give the cast its due several of the stars fought tooth and nail against making the filmmost notably Leslie Howard who even went so far as give press interviews stating that he was much too old to play Romeo in a screen production. When forced into the production by contractual obligation Howard and his counterparts gave it their all but sad to say the camera did not lie they were indeed too old. Although some viewers are able to suspend disbelief to accept the stars in such youthful roles I myself could not. I found it occasionally absurd but more often embarrassing with the famous balcony a case in point. All of this might be forgiven if the stars actually generated any sense of passion but they do notand it is really here that their ages tell for instead of the whitehot passions of youth that lead to disaster we have instead a gentle love story with an unhappy ending.Still the film really is pretty to look atit has an engraved quality in its glossy black and whiteand if you close your eyes you can enjoy the 'grand manner' readings which is a great deal more than one can say for most cinematic Shakespearean interpretations. There is also Edna May Oliver's performance and she is excellent in the role of Juliet's babbling nurse.Fans of this film's stars will no doubt wish to add it to their library and those interested in seeing how Hollywood approached Shakespeare in the 1930s will enjoy seeing it at least oncebut I would hesitate to recommend this film to any one outside that circle. Most viewers will be happier with the later Franco Zefferilli version.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

	schema:reviewBody "Reading these other reviews brought me to the point where I almost screamed at the inanity of the repetitive commentary about the ages of Howard Shearer and Barrymore in particular and a few others in general. Yes the leads are all supposed to be teenagers but I can assure these complainers that when this movie was made in 1936  that's 82 years ago  only a devout Shakespearean would have realized that or given much consequence to it. The movie audiences of 1936  and probably most of the movie audiences of today  almost certainly did not know that the leads were supposed to be about 16 and 14 respectively. In fact the ages are not mentioned anywhere in the play so even those two numbers are somewhat questionable facts. And I imagine that even with Shakespeare there would have been some complaints about showing a 14yearold girl having sex with a 16yearoldboy back then and theaters might have been raided if they used actors of that age to play the roles. Remember that as late as in 1962 they had to add about four years to the age of Lolita to even get LOLITA made and they had to hire an actress who was 16 rather than 12 or they might have all been arrested!. One simply accepted the leads as the youngest members of their warring families but not necessarily as teenagers. THAT'S A FACT! Yes the stage lends distance to our acceptance of such characters' ages and if you think Barrymore at 54 was old for Mercutio please be advised that in 2016 that character was played on the London stage by Derek Jacobi 78 at the time! Even Olivier was far too old and actually looked it even with blond hair to play Hamlet in 1948 and he won the Academy Award for it. So please let's stop all this nonsense about age. If you'd prefer Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey fine but don't take it out on Howard and Shearer. As for those two I've always loved Howard but feel that this is one of the least impressive film performances he ever gave whereas I think Juliet may be Shearer's best film performance  and I think she looks a lot younger than her 34 years here anyway. She certainly acts it which cannot be said for Howard. Barrymore who was past his 40th birthday when he first did his famous Hamlet on the stage is properly hammy here but I couldn't understand much of him in his set speeches like the Queen Mab one and I always love Edna May Oliver but also couldn't understand much of her dialogue. The actor I thought most natural of all and who is hardly mentioned anywhere in these reviews was Reginald Denny as Benvolio. Anyway I find it a delightful film throughout but do wish they could have granted my dearest wish and had Claude Rains dub Andy Devine!".

Cukor's version is a near literal translation of the play whereas the Zeffirelli and Lurhmann versions cut at least half the text. However this paradoxically produces the slow pace which is a fault for this film. This is a story of transcendent evanescent love and having it be slow and anemic doesn't do it justice IMO.In short the 1936 version may be the most literal but the Zeffirelli and Luhrmann films both are more faithful to the spirit of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.".

If you are tolerant of a Noh drama Macbeth and a street hood Romeo and Juliet why trash an equally unauthentic treatment just because you have a problem with geriatrics?The costumes are quite nicenot authentic as Zeffirelli's but a good example of the design geniuses under contract to MGM. Ditto the sets although their staginess can be distracting. William Daniels who shot Greed for Stroheim and Naked City for Dassin shows that when it came to absolutely gorgeous though unrealistic lighting there was no one better and why Garbo insisted he shoot all her films. Katherine DeMille's choreography is fun to watch and with what little I know about dance history may even be authenticthough I doubt it.Leslie Howard was a great actorhad he only been 20 years younger he would have been perfect. Rathbone never really got the attention from the director's camera setups he deserved and almost steals every scene he is in anyway.Barrymore was almost 30 years too old but he will always be Mercutio for me. His Mab speech is brillianthonoring the poetry but not slowing things down and being consistent with Mercutio's manic character. The blend of comedy and pathos he achieves in his death scene is remarkable. One of the problems with McEnery's performance in the Zeffirelli version is that he is so obviously suffering from mortal wounds after the duel that Whiting's Romeo appears like a callow dolt. With Barrymore's performance you too can't believe the wound can be that much. What amazing diction! Too bad his Shakespearean performances form the first quarter of the 20th century were not recorded.".

The story is compelling and moving still and the writing likewise though one or two speeches could have been delivered a little slower. The music also is charming and wonderfully romantic in places. Of the cast I did get more pleasure of the supporting turns more than the leads. Though the leads certainly weren't bad. Leslie Howard is perhaps too mature and lacks Romeo's boyish passion but he does at least have a grasp of the style. Norma Shearer starts off a little shaky coming across as too giddy on her first appearancewas it an attempt to show some girlish naivety? but she is very moving from that point on and exudes good chemistry with Howard. John Barrymore also was a point of controversy true he is a little too insidycratic in places but as Mercutio overall he is delicious and steals his scenes. The best turns though come from Edna May Oliver as a warm and humorous Nurse and the wonderfully oily Tybalt of Basil Rathbone. Ralph Forbes does what he can though the role of Paris is rather thankless. All in all a good version. 710 Bethany Cox".

COMMENT It's very tempting simply to laud all aspects of this magnificent production and let it go at that. But we must face the intrinsic problem of Romeo and Juliet. Are Leslie Howard and Norma Shearer  charismatic though their performances certainly are  miscast? The answer depends entirely on your point of view. From Shakespeare's own viewpoint the answer is yes  but his reasons will surprise you. Shakespeare would have thought Howard was the right age for the part even though Romeo is supposed to be a teenage youth but found his impersonation too understated lacking passion fire and color. Shakespeare would have preferred John Barrymore in the role. As for Norma Shearer full marks for her interpretation but still totally wrong for the part as she is the wrong age and the wrong sex! In Shakespeare's day females were not allowed to act on the stage although it could certainly be argued that the master would have heartily approved a change in the law. Looking at the problem from a modern viewpoint I tend to agree with the director George Cukor. Despite the youth of the two protagonists their ideas their speech their imagery is extremely mature and sophisticated. Mind you really talented young players could possibly bring this off but I've yet to see them. So let's not argue whether Howard is too old Shearer too mature. Brilliantly directed by George Cukor this Romeo and Juliet is easily the finest Shakespeare on film. The master's dialogue has been superbly edited by Talbot Jennings to retain all the essentials. While the beauty of the poetry is preserved the screen is rarely swamped with words. In fact the action moves forward at such a rapid pace  and is presented with such pictorial flourishes  that we soon lose all realization as we should that the actors are speaking blank verse. It is a weakness of the play that First and Second Acts are livelier than the Third though Juliet does have a hairraising speech on the horrors of the charnel house. The sets the decor the costumes the music score are all breathtakingly magnificent. Romeo and Juliet probably ranks as the finest example of MGM craftsmanship in that studio's golden thirties.".

One is constantly aware that Juliet and her mother appear to be contemporaries! This version of the loveandhate saga drives home the timeless themes at work in this Renaissance story  that try as one might to follow one's dream and be true to oneself one can be thwarted by the ridiculous vagaries of fate at any moment. In other words the best laid plans of mice and men... We see here a world in which parents profess to love their children but never really listen to them. It is their goals and not their children's that count in the end. We also witness the terrible consequences of living in a world in which one person's behavior is rigidly dictated by another's. Had Romeo not killed Tybalt how might this have all turned out? One is left pondering whether times have really changed that much since the days of the Plague. Speaking of which Cukor injects the disease into this film in the most dramatic of ways trapping the messengermonk in a house of pestilent death. An exquisitely heartrending detail! I'm very glad I saw this. It renews my awe at the talent of the Bard.".

Someone asked why he had not played Romeo given his penchant for playing the Lover. Barrymore replied for two reasons dear boy...Juliet and Mercutio. Barrymore was correct in that Juliet is the stronger of the two leads and Mercutio of course is the most colorful of the supporting players. Basil Rathbone plays himself naturally a calculating villain of course. Norma Shearer gives the strength to Juliet that Leslie Howard Lacks in Romeo.Barrymore was by the time of this movie considered to be washed up in Hollywood. He gave one more creditable performance in 1939 in the great man votes and one more comdeic performance in midnight after Romeo and Juliet. His role in this film is the standout performance. For the ladies my nod goes to Edna Mae Oliver the starchy character actress as Juliet's nurse.the scenery is too gaudy even for Shakespeare's standards. The costumes however are a delight. This movie filmed before Irving Thalberg's death was released after he died.".

It definitely works as porn thanks to the amazing Shu Qi who made her debut with this film and who's possibly the most beautiful person in the world but at it's heart it's more of comedy that just happens to be about sex. I seriously think most people even if they weren't interested in the porn aspect would not be able to resist loving this film because it's just so hilarious and bizarre. It's not for conservatives obviously but if you like sexual humor this will definitely be one of your alltime favorites.

In the totally nuts finale Yau must resist coming whilst being shagged by Mirage Lady the demon's weakest moment being during orgasm.A category III Classic they don't come much sexier or sillier than this the action being absolutely ridiculous and the women incredibly hot.

After surviving the fall from their hotel room window Duane Bradley and his misshapen basketdwelling brother Belial are taken to the city hospital. By now their attempt at leading a secret life is blown and the pair have become media darlings across the country. Meanwhile Duane's longlost Aunt learns of their situation and along with her pregnant daughter Susan helps them escape from the confines of the hospital and the eye of the press. Duane and Belial's aunt known as Granny Ruth takes them under her wing at her mansion which serves as a safe haven for hideously deformed freaks of all shapes and sizes. Unfortunately the whereabouts of this dynamic duo don't remain secret for too long and Duane and Belial team up with Susan Granny Ruth and her houseful of mutants to devise a plan to do away with the exploitative reporters once and for all.";

The freaks can get annoying at times and at one scene I quote my friend who said Now it's just a bunch of freaks running around. I recommend this only if you have seen the first Basket Case and it's not as entertaining as either BC1 or BC3 but still I'm glad to have it in my collection. Also it has the sex scene nobody wanted.....Be warned! 710Rated 18s for horror violence and some gore language sex?! and brief mild nudity".

The only problem is that since so many years have passed since the original the actors have obviously aged quite a bit so the idea that this is the actually occurring the very same night is a bit over the top but since the film is a comedy it really does not matter. Duane Bradley and his brother Belail are 'rescued' during an attempt to escape from the hospital by Granny Ruth and her grand daughter Susan. They then take refuge in Granny Ruth's house of 'freaks'. This is when things really begin to get strange. The makeup effects are really good and there is just the right amount of humor and horror combined in the design of the 'freaks' that it makes for a highly entertaining flick. Each resident takes on their own personality and even though they later turn murderous the viewer finds themselves not only sympathizing with Duane his brother and the rest of the freaks but you will actually find yourself rooting them on as they seek revenge against several reporters from a sleazy tabloid who threaten to expose the Bradleys as well as a sleazy old man who runs a 'freak show' and falsely claims to have captured Belail. The makeup effects and the murder sequences are quite bizarre but highly amusing.

It's not awful but the charm of the original is lost in this film with a comedy element trying too much to be funny and a bigger budget replacing the raw and gritty feel which made the original a grind house treat. The special effects and acting are a tad better this time around though I miss the originals funny over the top performances. The plot is really lame and there's hardly any gore to be found. Though there is a lot more freaks this time but they seem to take back seat to Beliel as he orchestrates most of the violence while they spectate. In doing so you hope they would get into the action but they seem harmless and play more towards the comedy side of things. Towards the end there are some comical scenes that you think what the??? Or why am I seeing this??? Its alright I guess but you could say it's a pretty pointless sequel. 35".

In my opinion it really improves on the original and beats Frankenhooker in entertainment value although some of the ideas in Frankenhooker were possibly more interesting. It leads on directly from the original movie and yes it does look like a studio made film rather than the location shot original but that doesn't matter what matters is the plot is not as simple as the original which really just told how they came into being and then they went around killing a few doctors. This has more humour it's more creepy in places the special effects are better. In fact it is all just better than the original except of cause it doesn't have the rough edge of the ultralow budget original but this is replaced with a much more enjoyable to watch film. I wasn't expecting much from this but what I got was a very good hour and a half's entertainment which was even sicker than the original! The 'baby' part was surprising! Ignore the other comments trust me if you like Henenlotter's other movies and Bryan Yuzna's Society you're pretty likely to gain plenty of entertainment from this. I think the original had more emotion but this has more action take your pick. I give it 810!".

	schema:reviewBody "The first Basket Case movie looked like it was made on a shoestring budget. It also featured some horrible acting and directing. But director Frank Henenlotter obviously had learned since and gained more experience. The movie is more consistent this time also in its pace.There was obviously some more money to spend this time compared to the first movie. The movie is overall more professional looking and so is the Belial character. There is more movement and detail in the guy. It's professionalism also makes this an overall more effective genre movie.Luckily the movie obviously also doesn't take itself very serious which in the end also is this movie its strongest point. It knows it's ridicules and it actually exploits this by putting in more ridicules new looking characters and silly moments and dialog and the actors also seem to be totally aware of this. It's also a reason why this movie is a totally pleasant genre movie to watch. It knows it's a B and cultmovie and it doesn't resists against it. Not in the least of course due to the later success and cult following the first movie received.Kevin Van Hentenryck is still as horrible as ever before in his acting but they cleverly resolved this by putting in way more characters this time so the entire focus of the movie this time isn't just upon Duane and Belial. It also lets Duane act more as a psycho this time which also allows Van Hentenryck to do his bad overacting and make him get away with it.The story is of course silly but it also still is a notch up when compared to the first movie. It's at least more layered also of course due to the fact that there are more characters in it this time. But no overall you can't really call the movie anything more than just plain silly. Fun but silly.Supriningly much better than the first movie due to the fact it was made with more money and people involved and because the movie luckily doesn't take itself serious at all. It makes sure that you as a viewer also just can't take it serious at all and therefor lets you sit back and just enjoy the ride!710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember being disappointed with this when I first viewed it and revisiting it nearly 20 years later brings about the same feeling. The film picks up right where the first one left of with Duane Bradley Kevin Van Hentenryck being attacked by his mutant brother and falling out the window of his Times Square flophouse. Naturally this is big news and Granny Ruth Annie Ross a friend of Duane's aunt goes to rescue him from the hospital. She brings the duo back to her mansion where she houses a variety of freaks.Frank Henenlotter's followup is obviously a bigger affair with a nice budget from James Glickenhaus but this sequel fails to pack the sleazy punch of the first film. Part of the problem for me is the other freaks. They are just too corny and I can't believe I am saying this unrealistic. I can accept a mutated mass of flesh like Belial. But a guy with 27 noses or a huge mouth that sings opera? Too much. I do applaud Henenlotter for bringing Van Hentenryck back and Ross is good as Ruth. My favorite character though is freakshow owner Lyle Barker Jan Saint. He is the only one who carries over that air of realistic sleaze from the first film. Trash low life scum!".

It lacks the realism that the first film depended on.  The acting is better Ted Sorel From Beyond is great.  The movie is a just a bit too comedic for my tastes.  The freaks are mostly stupid but Belial still kicks ass though.  He gets an upgrade in this film from stopmotion to animatronics.  All in all the film still has that great stomachturning quality and the sex scene you never wanted to see.  And it does have a great climax the ending alone is worth watching the entire movie for.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is really original. I have respect for any movie that can make you laugh make you sick make you a little nervous AND inspire concern all at the same time especially considering it probably cost a total of 50 cents to produce from the look of things.Everyone remembers how Duane's brother was a mutant lump cut off and left for dead in the garbage then Duane tossed the whole mess in a basket and they became a homicidal tagteam. The story continues with the brothers being rescued by an older lady and her daughter who run a home for outcast mutants and the complications that follow.This film is a lot like Tod Browning's Freaks it isn't horror really the story is told from the point of view of the monsters who are far more interesting and poignant than the evil people around them. The difference is that Freaks was played more straight and this is played mostly for laughs and splatter. I think the combination works wellone of the few cases where cheesiness actually works in a movie's favor. There's something really disturbing about how well everything is lit how matteroffact everyone in the mutant household is how light everything is played. You can tell the director is gently nudging you in the side but that he's ready to pounce on you like a snake with fangs at any moment if you get too comfortable.Witness the scene where the wonderful Annie Ross is trying to coax Belial out of hidingit's sweet a little sad realistic fascinating...and creepy too where IS Belial and when will he appear?. It's played with complete sincerity and works on a dark level. There's a uniquely disturbing scene in a bar slowly filling up with background characters that you don't quite notice at least the first time that works some great paranoia in. And the ending is just downright nasty. It's a testament to the abilities of the director that he was able to juggle pathos black humor gore and psychological disturbance all at once. Which is not to suggest that he was so talentedthis IS a bad movie and the third sequel was even cheaper and worse in my opinion...and I wasn't impressed with anything else by him and his team of friends. But this is not much like any other movie I can think ofon the weirdometer it gets a solid 8!I wish the makeup had been a tad more realistic some of the silliness could have been toned down and the acting leaves something to be desired...but I'll always be a sucker for a movie about a house full of homicidal mutant lunatics who live in harmony with one another and this one starts with that concept and keeps going from there. Worth a look if you liked the old late80's series Monsters which this resembles a lot.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frank Hennenlottermovies probably aren't for all tastes and judging by the other user comments his type of repulsive humor isn't appreciated much but if you're into bizarre offcategory horror films you'll dig this meaningless sequel for sure. 8 years after the original lowbudget classic better say classsick! Basket Case Hennenlotter delivers a sequel less brutal and less gore but more absurd and imaginative. Part two starts where the first left off with Duane and his umtwin brother surviving a near fatal fall of the New York hotel room. They escape from the hospital and the humongous press attention and find shelter in the mansion of Granny Ruth who already takes pity of multiple mutantrefugees. Together with a jolly bunch of freaks Duane fights vulture newspaper people and Belial even finds true love up in Ruth's attic Basket Case 2 is a sleazy and trashy romp that gives a totally new meaning to the expression bad taste. Highlight of the film unquestionably is the infamous sexsequence between Belial who's in fact half a person with a female companion in misfortune. This scene remains odd to look at even if you're  like me  already used to seeing a lot of extravagant horror footage. Unlike the original unfortunately this sequel doesn't contain any tension and the initial disturbance caused by the mysterious basket case has entirely vanished. The outrageous gore has been replaced by demented humor and an occasional reference to genre milestones like James Whale's Bride of Frankenstein and  of course  Tod Browning's Freaks. Frank Hennenlotter stands for unscrupulous horror entertainment and I'm a giant admirer of his twisted worldperspective. Every film of his comes with my highest possible recommendation make sure you check out Brain Damage and Frankenhooker and I'm very much anticipating his announced comeback to cinema in 2006 with a project called Sick in the Head.".

I have to admit that some of the freaks in the film are a bit much such as a gargoyle and frog but underneath the sick plot is a metaphor speaking out for those mistreated by the normallooking society who shun anyone that's different from them. I did feel the ending takes things a bit too far but it's more of a personal opinion..Duane's reaction to Susan's flaw and how he decides to rejoin with his brother maybe pushes the limits of bad taste. I found the film's two highlights being a back yard feast for the freaks by Ruth and a particular homage to Tod Browning's FREAKS. I did think effects whiz Gabe Bartalos came up with some amazingly creative grotesque facial designs for his freaks but Belial's attack sequences are rather laughable because he never escapes the unconvincing appearance of a rubber concoction.".

The sequel is more comedic more actively making fun of itself. There's some better makeup effects but also just as was the case before some really tacky ones as well. Overall this movie has some lighthearted fun to offer while at the same time succeeding in asking some deep questions about the nature of our society.What I found most enjoyable was Annie Ross's performance as Granny Ruth which was hilariously overthetop. She's quite a character in the movie and certainly carries it at times. Comparatively speaking Duane and his brother play less of an important role this time as the story branches out to include more characters and more freaks.Go and watch it if you liked the first installment of the series.".

It was made 33 years ago but it is as fabulous and modern as ever and it does not age at all. Miracles never do. No matter how many years have passed it will always be difficult to be a real man and always will be tedious to prove that you are worthy of your fame. And while there is humanity Glory to brave who dare to love knowing that this will come to an end. Thank to madmen who live as if they were immortal. I saw this miracle of fantasy music romance and comedy dozens of times and thought that I knew it almost by heart. But earlier today while rewatching it after many years for the first time I realized clearly that that the entire film all this glorious extravaganza is the anthem to love and passion of a creator to the process of creation to fantasy dreams the flights of imagination that give birth to miracles and give us the joy to witness and admire them. The film belongs to two wizards the miracleworkers. One in the amazing performance by Oleg Yankovki is the screen wizard whose love for his wife and imagination brought to live the story and the characters and turned their lives upside down sending them to the roads they never dreamed of going. He held the fate of all characters but gave them the choices that would change them forever. The other wizard is the Master behind the scenes Marc Zakharov whose talent creativity and vision made the miracle possible. Everything in it is magical the score and songs by G. Gladkov are so unique and memorablethey deserve separate and long conversation as well as festive Masqueradecarnival atmosphere bittersweet love stories not one but three and the amazing performance by all actors without exception. The best the film could be defined by the very first line of the main song the Wizard's song absurd ridiculous foolish crazy magical.".

But earlier today while rewatching it after many years for the first time I realized clearly that that the entire film all this glorious extravaganza is the anthem to love and passion of a creator to the process of creation to fantasy dreams the flights of imagination that give birth to miracles and give us the joy to witness and admire them. The film belongs to two wizards the miracleworkers. One in the amazing performance by Oleg Yankovki is the screen wizard whose love for his wife and imagination brought to live the story and the characters and turned their lives upside down sending them to the roads they never dreamed of going. He held the fate of all characters but gave them the choices that would change them forever. The other wizard is the Master behind the scenes Marc Zakharov whose talent creativity and vision made the miracle possible. Everything in it is magical the score and songs by G. Gladkov are so unique and memorablethey deserve separate and long conversation as well as festive Masqueradecarnival atmosphere bittersweet love stories not one but three and the amazing performance by all actors without exception. The best the film could be defined by the very first line of the main song the Wizard's song absurd ridiculous foolish crazy magical.";

The photography is of the kind that is simple but also very elegant. The music is orchestrated sensitively and to the extent that you wish you can buy it on CD alone the songs also stick in your head for days and are just lovely. There is some satire in the dialogue and it's very sharp and hilarious and there's a lot of thoughtful and touching moments too. The story made me laugh with the satire cry or feel very touched with the three romancesvery romantic and charming and in awe with the fantasy elements. It is also swiftly told I was impressed at how much there was it's a quite long film but never tiresome. The characters are quirky engage hugely all of them serving a point. The acting is theatrical but still very good Oleg Yankovsky and Irina Kupchenko are excellent. Overall beautiful film and a miracle really. 1010 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Mark Zakharov has done a number of interesting allegoric films 'To Kill a Dragon' for one often adapting plays of Yevgeni Shvarts. Yet 'An Oridnary Miracle' is much more than just one in a bunch.What we have here is a tale coming to life an allegory in its full sense. The plot is centered around the Wizard played superbly by Oleg Yankovsky and his wife another fantastic performance by Irina Kupchenko. The Wizard utters words and we see them come to life  literally. He is dictating every move of this story setting the pace and force of action. Creating a solid world by imagination a world that stumbles upon his tired wife and wouldn't leave until set right.The center of this imaginary world is a love story a fairy tale of a bear turned into a man who has to be kissed by a princess to return to his true form. Zakharov handles this in a beautiful way. The love story is very romantic yet never too sweet accompanied with superb supporting characters of the King Yevgeni Leonov and his Minister Administrator Andrei Mironov the very stars of the Soviet Russian cinema.Everything is very theatrical in this movie. Anotther commenter here mentioned it's due to Zakharov's occupation as a theatre director. Yet it seems there's more to it since other pictures of his hold less of this stage atmosphere. Having seen this movie numerous times i like to think this 'theatricity' as for one an homage to Shvarts' plays and also as yet another allegory of life and imagination when everyone of us can be creators of many things. Creating our own life which is nothing but an unordinary miracle.The whole movie i think comes to a simple truth articulated in many masterpieces it would fit to remember Tarkovsky here it is difficult to be a creator. This gift comes with its own rules sometimes far beyond control. Yet by allowing it to come we can produce small ordinary miracles. To quote the theme song of the movie 'awkwardly funnily illogically mindlessly  miraculously'.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been a huge fan of HK action films for many years and have amassed a collection of 500 kung fu films. Have heard about this film since forever and assumed it was ground breaking influential yada yada yada... but never really sought it out. I guess 'cause it's older than most and it's a swordplay film rather than all out kung fu action the likes of which Chang Cheh later specialized in i.e. the Venoms films. However finally having sat down and watched the remastered rerelease I was absolutely blown away. One of the most emotionally intense HK films I have seen. Ignore naysayers... they must be heartless robots. Dramatically it is certainly on par with Lau Kar Leung's own films and bears unmistakable thematic connections to his body of work especially 8 Diagram Pole Fighter. Not to mention it's wonderfully filmed. If scenes are too dark you just have a bad copy. The restored Celestial version is beautifully dark and vivid... no problem following the action. And there is plenty of action. Choreography is slightly dated but it's 1967! The fighting is easily as good as anything from the era. And yes I've seen the films the other reviewer mentions... also great films but by no means superior fightingwise. In fact I'd venture to say it's an important milestone in the progression of kung fu choreography... with the fighting playing a pivotal role in the storytelling. Okay most days I too would prefer to watch a Venoms movie with my jaw dropped open in disbelief at the superhuman abilities on display... but come on... this undoubtedly deserves the credit it receives. Any true fan of HK films needs to see this.".

But the point really is that the directors of these films use what they have to portray the culture in which they live in a manner as completely cinematic as can be found in any national film tradition.All this is a warm up to this The OneArmed Swordsman is as masterful a film as Kurosawa Akira's Yojimbo.I make this specific comparison because each film was made within a genre to which the film contributes genreshattering innovation while at the same time maintaining certain essential conventions that keep it safely within the genre. Thus Kurosawa's renegade ronin is a tough cynical manipulator of the various villains of the film in a way even the most tragic hero of the Japanese samurai film chambara of the time could never be nonetheless he still manages to kill everyone at the end much like all the other chambara heroes.Similarly Chang Cheh's OneArmed hero follows genre convention by performing superhuman feats of skill like leaving the imprint of his hand on a rock with a single blow but just as a character he is completely new.The typical wu xia film of the time generally had an aristocratic hero if he had no personal problems to deal with he always wore white. If he had personal problems he would drink heavily and dress like a mendicant monk. He was in utter thrall to whatever worthiest female was in his immediate vicinity his cause was always to uphold the right protect chastity and further the wellbeing of the Chinese people as a whole. His one real defect as a type was that he really liked fighting which usually got him into trouble with those with similar enjoyments.Chang Cheh's Feng Kong as played by Wang Yu in what is his finest role is not an aristocrat but an orphaned son of a servant he doesn't wear white he wears black remaining loyal to her father his former teacher he grows to hate the young lady who chopped off his arm I certainly would and grows attached to the dead warrior's daughter with whom he sleeps without marriage only after she has nursed him back to health  but he remains determined to control his own fate nonetheless. The future of the Chinese people doesn't interest him. Eventually he abjures fighting and goes off to become a farmer.As can be discovered from various interviews Chang Cheh in filming what is still his most completely realized vision was perfectly aware that he was making such innovations. In fact in terms of traditional Chinese culture alone The OneArmed Swordsman comes across as a radical Confucian demand for recognition of merit above social status and of the need for social stability over and against any desire for personal revenge.Furthermore Chang Cheh pulls this off in a manner utterly consistent with the social trends of the 1960s  Feng Kong is portrayed as an angry young man  the representative of an entire generation fed up with many of the myths of the old culture to which they have been indoctrinated. He is brazen energetic honest and more than a little suspicious of old prejudices which have never favored him anyway. And having been told that he was not born worthy he sets out to proves that he can learn selfsufficiency without the benefit of institutional education. He doesn't need to start a revolution  he IS a revolution.Of course if the general quality of the film as a whole were not utterly topnotch this message would be meaningless. But the camerawork supporting performances by the other actors staging and direction and most of the editing are all worldclass  as good as anything coming out of Hollywood that decade and better than any Hollywood film of the decade's latter half.Let the genre conventions be what they are and pay respect to one of the best films of its type  and perhaps one of the finest films ever made worldwide.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE ONEARMED SWORDSMAN 1967 is often cited as Hong Kong's first real martial arts film i.e. with emphasis on martial techniques styles and training rather than on clan politics corrupt officials and court intrigue. Star Jimmy Wang Yu is much more intense here than in most of his previous starring roles e.g. TWIN SWORDS and TRAIL OF THE BROKEN BLADE and his fighting is much more ferocious. Overall this is a bleak somber film with occasional tearjerking and melodramatic moments. The darkly handsome Wang Yu brings the right tone of brooding and melancholy and makes the climactic moments of violent outburst quite satisfying.Wang Yu plays Fang Kang a martial arts student whose right arm is chopped off in a sudden confrontation with his master's impetuous daughter and then must learn how to fight with his left. He runs off and finds a simple farm girl Hsiao Man Chiao Chiao to take him in and care for him. She has a halfburned old swordfighting manual which she gives to Fang to teach himself lefthand sword techniques. Her father had died after a sword fight over the book and her mother had started to burn it.  Her mother had warned her to never fall for a sword fighter and she urges Fang never to fight. However after he is humiliated by some martial arts students when they try to flirt with Hsiao Man Fang resolves to fight again.Fang is forced into action when his former master Teacher Chi and his students are attacked by LongArmed Devil who has called on evil swordsmen including Smiling Face and his two loutish students to raid Teacher Chi's school during Chi's retirement party. Long Arm gets things rolling by sending his two henchmen to kill any students they can waylay. The henchmen have a swordlock on their swords with which they can trap the opponents' swords and slay the opponent with a right hand dagger to the belly. Ultimately only Wang Yu's short broken sword is capable of counteracting the swordlock. Wang Yu returned to the role of Fang in THE RETURN OF THE ONEARMED SWORDSMAN 1968 which is even more focused on swordfights and bloodshed and is also reviewed on this site. He later left Shaw Bros. to star in ONEARMED BOXER 1971 which along with his last Shaw Bros. film THE CHINESE BOXER 1970 was a seminal film in the budding kung fu genre.".

However there are several amazing films this one included who set high standards for the genre such as many of the films of Sonny Chiba the Bruce Lee films few as they are and the Zatoichi series. Remember folks not all martial arts films are created equal!! While I could harp on a few flaws that are noticeable in the film such as the scene at midnight that goes from day to night like an Ed Wood film the perfection of most of the film greatly outweighs the few mistakesplus for the time it was made it was about as good as you can find. And while I am very very hesitant to give scores of 10 this one deserves it because it is the epitome of a great Chinese martial arts film.There are two main reasons to love this film. First being the premier episode of the One Armed Swordsman series there is much more to the movie than a boss battle. Instead you learn the devious and complicated reason for Fang Gang losing his arm as well as the steps he took to learn to fight lefthanded. Second and probably more importantly you see the best sword fighting and martial arts action...period. Gone are the obvious misses as they pull their swings gone is the grunting and silly dialog provided you watch it with the optional Chinese language and English subtitles and there is plenty of realistic looking bloodthough not so much to make it a disgusting or gratuitous movie.If you like this film and only an idiot wouldn't then try watching the other films in the series. Also try the films of the others I mentioned above. Not every Kung Fu or Karate movie involves uggh! martial arts fighting gorillas men with arms that grow to 12 feet in length and the other silly touches you see in lesser films. Now I still watch and enjoy these other films when I need a laugh but they just can't come close to class products like this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though the chambara influence on Chang Cheh was already seen in his previous film The Magnificent Trio 1966 a remake of Hideo Gosha's Three Outlaw Samurai 1964 and quite possibly the earlier Tiger Boy 1966 not available on DVD it would be The OneArmed Swordsman that would help define Cheh as an auteur with his own blend of Japanese action aesthetics American rebellious characters and Chinese wuxia heroes. This film would not only be the first film to break the 1 million HK dollars barrier it would also be a watershed moment for the area's cinema. The popularity of this film as well as King Hu's hit the year before Come Drink With Me helped push in a new era of Mandarin language movies as well as push out the indigenous language Cantonese cinema for several years. But it would be the brutal style of Chang that would dominate the regional efforts and not the Peking Opera influenced King Hu. This movie would also be the first in the subgenre of onearmed films that stereotyped the career of the star of this movie Jimmy Wang Yu.Wang Yu had already acted in a couple of Chang Cheh films but it is his performance here as Fang Gang that would make him a star in Hong Kong. Fang is an orphan whose father had perished saving the life of Qi Rufeng Tien Feng. Qi shows his gratefulness by taking on Fang as a student. Fang also obtains the broken sword that was used by his father but it could not possibly be of any use. He quickly becomes an adept student that because of his success and austereness has earned the ire of not only a couple of rich students but also with Qi Peier Pan Yingzi the daughter of the sifu when he rebukes her advances. It is usually a bad idea to turn down your teacher's daughter and in this film it is no exception.Fang's skill level is so advanced that he toys with the other students and Peier when they intend on teaching him a lesson. He completely outclasses them with his masculine masterful display of martial arts. However since he is only toying with them he lets his guard down not expecting that the petulant daughter will exact her revenge by cutting off his right arm. It is not difficult to see this as a castration allegory for not only embarrassing her in the fight but also not returning her affections.Blooded and broken Fang stumbles off leaving a crimson trail while not bloody by later Shaw Brothers standards this was gory for its time until he gets found and saved by orphan Xiao Man Lisa Chiao Chiao who hates the world of martial arts because it lead to the death of her father. Yet when Fang wakes from his shock induced slumber later gets beat up by a couple of ruffians falls into a deep doleful state she takes pity on him and gives him her father's manual of martial arts. While part of the manual is missing it luckily has the leftarm portions. A few days later he is an accomplished onearmed fighter. Obviously it is unrealistic that in a short time he could lose an arm and then become an accomplished fighter and one scene of him displaying his power of chi should probably have been trimmed as it does not fit in with the rest of the film this treatment is probably copasetic with the Jin Yong novel The Return of the Condor Heroes 1959 this movie is influenced by.Meanwhile Qi Rufeng has decided that he is going to retire from the martial arts world at the age of 55. With all of his success as a swordsman he has created many enemies. Two brothers Smiling Tiger Cheng Tian Shou Tang Ti and LongArmed Devil called this because of his whip played effectively by the ubiquitous Yeung Chihing have devised a way to destroy him and it involves a weapon that can render Qi's Dao sword that his entire school uses useless. The lesson behind this is to always teach your students to be proficient in more than one weapon and do not always cling to one approach to fighting. With Qi's best student missing in more ways than one and his other disciples being removed from this planet his reign as head of the martial arts world seems to be at an end.Wang Yu gives a good performance as the stoic brooding loner who is a combination of a wuxia hero and James Dean. He is not the most adept martial artist though. His Narcissist nature angered many actors and gave way to mediocre performances in the 1970s and beyond. Because of this and his later exploits in Taiwanese triads his reputation has suffered quite a bit among Hong Kong cinema fans. For the most part I tend to agree with the critics and fanboys on this except for his most famous OneArmed roles he seemed born to play even if he does have two arms.While the influences of such Japanese films as the Zatoichi series are strong on this movie it still has uniqueness to it that interests me. This would be a highly influential film to the Hong Kong audience not only on technical issues such as one of the first uses and overuses of handheld camera in HK but in thematic elements as well. It is enjoyable to see the whole martial art world questioned and Fang's subjugation to his principles are reminiscent of a Randolph Scott character in a Budd Boetticher western. This movie would spawn several sequels remakes and retreads and certainly up the ante for use of blood packets missing limbs and stomach slashes. While the action scenes might feel dated and might not be plentiful enough for some viewers it is one of the better and most important Hong Kong films of the 1960s.".

The idea that the only thing that can save the school is Fang Gang's broken sword that his father left him upon dying was poetic.The plot has all the makings of a great martial arts film. Where the film falls down though is in the badly choreographed sword fights and really cheap sets and bad lighting. The swordfights are often wooden and slow.I ask anyone who has raved about this film here to look at the choreography critically... it does not come close to the best in the genre.Granted the fact that it is an early work 1967 probably explains this but still does not change it.".

The colors are vibrant and the print is mostly scratchfree. You also get to appreciate how director Chang Cheh in the late 60searly 70s was a cutabovetherest storyteller with his camera placement and some fluid tracking shots thereby transcending a lot of the hackneyed scripting stilted acting and the studiobound sets. However I also took exception to the fact that the DVD did not contain commentary by Quentin Tarantino as promised by the box notes and the 2 film students who did provide commentary left a lot to be desired. Surely Tarantino would have remarked upon the fact that the most noticeable parts of the musical score including the entire end title scene was lifted lock stock and barrel from the 1966 Ralph Nelson western DUEL AT DIABLO. Composer Neal Hefti's estate should sue! And at another dramatic moment a very familiar John Barry suspense motif from the Connery Bond films makes a 3second appearance. It's really pathetic that these film scholars completely missed these cultural touchstones that make Hong Kong movies from this era such crazyquilt pleasures.".

OneArmed Swordsman happens to be one of the best remembered and loved stories that defined wuxia and it is no doubt that actor Wang Yu and director Chang Cheh were made household names.Common themes in wuxia like brotherhood romance piety revenge are all rolled into OneArmed Swordsman. A son of a servant who died valiantly protecting his master Qi Rufeng of the Golden Sword Clan Fang Gang Want Yu was brought up by Qi Rufeng as one of his disciples but his daughter Qi Peier accidentally chops off Fang Gang's right arm in a fit of petty anger.Running away and injured Fang Gang was saved by a village girl Hsiao Man who nurses him back to health and passes to him half a sacred kung fu manual which has only the lefthanded moves left yes it's that convenient. Swearing to leave the martial arts world and minding his own business little does he realize that a rival clan has developed weapons and moves to counter the Golden Sword Clan and are out for blood.Realizing that he cannot let down the master who has brought him up Fang Gang goes to their rescue against the wishes of Hsiao Man. Caught between two benefactors Fang Gang has to make the decision one in which only a true swordsman will definitely make.The martial arts compared to today's standards might seem cheesy but it's the good old days sans wire work. The teahouse fight remains one of the better sequences and they all get as bloody as they can get hence Chang Cheh was also known as the ketchup director. You'll marvel at how smart editing actually allows for some slick martial arts moves to be performed.Characters are kept simple  the good are good and the bad are really evil and look the part too. It's a one dimensional world but that keeps the storyline simple as you await the action to begin.So for that introductory look into the world of Wuxia OneArmed Swordsman might just be the vehicle for you  characters themes weapons the hallmark elements of a good wuxia film are all there.This Code 3 DVD contains a behind the scenes gallery the trailers production notes and biographies and a segment on 5 animated works done by various educational institutions in Asia.

The evil villain devises a special technique complete with a custom sword to defeat the Qi sword style. And the Qi family is completely unable to defeat this new technique. They push forth like lemmings each one dying in the same fashion as his predecessor. When their self preservation instinct raises a notion to perhaps team up and take advantage of their 20  3 numbers to defeat their enemies the main villain chides them to keep fighting one on one. As self preservation once again takes a step back they continue fighting and dying one at a time until the timely arrival of our handicapable hero who uses his new style to quickly dispatch the villains.If our hero kept his arm he no doubt would have died too as the Qi sword style is apparently completely incapable of improvisation. This really killed the enjoyment of the movie for me as by the time the 10th Qi student died IN EXACTLY THE SAME FASHION I would have figured that someone would have tried something new. At no point did Bruce Lee's critique of the rigidity of Chinese martial arts ring more true.If this particular problem does not bother you as much as it did me then this can be a quite enjoyable late 60s Shaw Brothers experience.

Qi promises the dying man that he will raise his son the boy retrieves his father's broken sword which will prove pivotal later and grows up to be Wang Yu. Belittled for being the son of a mere servant the adult Yu decides to leave the school but Qi's daughter whose advances Yu has rebuffed takes it upon herself to amputate his right arm in retribution. This impromptu surgery takes place in a snowbound forest and is foreshadowed by the chopping off of a tree limb. It's a remarkably bloodless affair and Yu staggers away to throw himself off a bridge but he falls instead on the conveniently passing boat of Miss Xiaoman who nurses him back to health. Meanwhile Smiling Tiger whose smile is deceptive and Longarmed Devil whose whip and short spears are extensions of his reach one presumes have decided to hunt down and kill all of Qi's Golden Sword students. The bad guys have developed a swordlock weapon that coupled with the use of a dagger makes them night unbeatable. Yu meanwhile gets better though he's remarkably proficient with his left hand for a man used to fighting with his right. He even develops Chi to the point where he can push air ? hard enough to trim limbs from a tree and leave his palmprint in a tree stump. These two incidents happen backtoback and both involve tree LIMBS and a tree STUMP. One can only wonder if the symbolism was intentional by director Chang Cheh. My guess would be that it WAS. All of the foregoing leads to a final confrontation at the Golden Sword school that should not be missed.".

	schema:reviewBody "While sick with the flu lying in bed I had the enormous privilege to experience the Shaw Brothers production The OneArmed Swordsman the legendary Hong Kong success from heralded director Cheh Chang. It concerns a young disciple Fang KangYu Wang whose skills as a martial artist are enhanced by his master swordsman QiChungHsin Huang. Qi trained him from childhood after Kang's father is killed defending his master against a foe's host of disciples. Qi's arch nemesis is LongArmed DevilChihChing Yang and the two have been at war for some time. LongArmed Devil has developed a sword with a lock that can trap the long heavy golden swords which are used by Qi's disciples. PieriYin Tze Panis Qi's only daughter and she is responsible for cutting off Kang's right arm rendering him a cripple. She was jealous of her father's affection for Kang and bothered by his supposed arrogance. Lucky for Kang he falls into the boat of a country girl XiomanChiao Chiao and she gets her grandfather and cousin to assist in saving his life. Kang and Xioman attempt to make a life for themselves but the onearmed swordsman's past life never seems to relinquish him from aiding his master. Qi's daughter is temporarily kidnapped by LongArmed Devil's brother Smiling TigerTi Tang so he has to rescue her. And when LongArmed Devil's disciples ambush Qi's men in separate situations using the sword with the lock Kang will have to help his master yet again. Thanks to a special martial arts book Xioman had from her dead father a warrior himself who died for his master Kang was able to train himself using just his one hand..kudos to Yu for being able to successfully pull of swordfighting against adversaries using only the left hand and to the director for lensing the choreography without revealing his right arm. The director opts to shoot the fight sequences mostly handheld which provides for lively battles between opposition. The marvelous studio sets are well utilized and the story is well developed giving good treatment to the relationship of Kang and Xioman. The film's story also has an indictment of martial arts and how being equipped with fighting skills not to mention the concern of honorably defending your teacher can produce a lifetime of suffering and death. Through Xioman and Kang both orphaned because of their fathers' honor code to fight for their teachers the film shows how there must be an alternative to this kind of lifestyle. The OneArmed Swordsman gave me all I could ask for in regards to swordplay blood and hacked limbs..a triumph. Really neat is how Kang is able to use his father's broken sword to outduel his enemies who have superior weaponry. The movie has colorful villains whose lecherous qualities serve the plot well in regards to building the heroism of Qi's men including Kang. Despite their futile efforts to proudly fight for their teacher we see how Qi's disciples march straight into peril for LongArmed Devil's men were simply better equipped for the final climactic showdown.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a pretty original and refreshing genre movie and not just for its time. Of course the concept alone of having a onearmed swordsman as the main character in a Hong Kong martial arts movie is already original and refreshing on its own. But also the whole handling and development of the storyline is great and refreshing. It's not just some mindless chopping in this movie.I must admit that in this case I liked the 1995 remake Dao even a better as movie. It had a better storyline better emotions better villains better fight sequences and a better overall style. Nevertheless this movie is still a better one than Dao is. Qualitivly the story is a better told one and of course simply just because this movie was first and therefor automatically is also more original.It's already an outdated and somewhat silly looking movie. It's a movie with some fake looking sets and beards and some horrible added sound effects. Also the blades and blood are obvious fakes. The movie on its own is pretty violent and graphic but because of its fake look its nothing too shocking or impressive. It also is not like its laughable it just makes the movie look outdated.The fights also aren't ever really long one's but they are really well choreographed and makes it very enjoyable to view for the fans of the genre. Toward the end the action of course starts to kick in even more. It's also true that the movie gets even better by then.This just is no Hollywood movie so the editing and camerawork might seem a bit off to some but this is of course all part of the Asian style of filmmaking. Not that I'm a particular great fan of it all though. In some things Hollywood movies are just better mostly when it comes down to the technical things behind filmmaking.A great and original movie within its genre!910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

However if you can't stand flying or understand the fun in it it's not worth viewing. But if you like movies like this watch it.By the way it's from time to time almost the same as watching those Mountainbike vids that you can run as a background on your PC. Nice shots with nice action to look at and you can watch it all day long.I gave it 8 points 2 for the flying 4 for the camera and the idea another 2 for the not too bad acting. No seriously it's 8 points mostly to the camera and the idea behind the flight shots. It could be 10 without any acting in between but then it wouldn't have been a movie for the regular cinema anymore.".

	schema:reviewBody "Admitedly this film is somewhat lacking in film techniques and complexity but the reason for this is not that it is a bad film but rather a film with a different aim. With so many films coming out every year it is unavoidable that they be judged and compared but this constant rating of films has created a certain stereotype of qualities which a film should have to be good. This kind of stereotyped rating although often setting a good standard for comparison works against films such as Sky Fighters. This is because in my opinion Sky Fighters has a different goal to most movies rather than using the common methods to deliver a complex story line Sky Fighters is a tribute to fighter pilots. It does an excellent job of portraying the complexity and importance of the role of a fighter pilot as well as demonstrating the qualities a pilot must posses. Sky Fighters uses all real flying and aerobatics footage to achieve a very real demonstration from the technical aspect of what it means to be a fighter pilot. This film is very appropriate for anyone interested in fighters aerobatics and the people behind them. I do not recommend it for audiences looking for a sophisticated or complex storyline.".

The plot is better than average has some similarities with Top Gun and the end is a bit anti climatic. I rated Top Gun better for the plot but Les Chevaliers du Ciel better for its flight scenes. And it is for the aircraft that you want to see this movie. The majority of the Top Gun scenes are shot from the ground here the flight scenes are shot from a modified fuel tank mounted on the Mirage 2000 or the Alphajet. The flights look very unique and many images are sensational. In Top Gun the adversary aircraft is either an A4 as used by Top Gun then or the Northrop F5 disguised as MIG29 in real life they are very different beasts. Here the adversary aircraft is a Mirage 2000 that was stolen by a terrorist organization. There are 2 scenes that are breathtaking and unique. One with a M2000 flying close and hiding under the belly of a Qatar Airways Airbus A340 in the opening section! And the other is a Mirage 2000D going supersonic ! at very low level over the Djibouti desert. The Mirage are flown by French Air Force pilots and you can see they make full advantage of the high roll rate of the delta wing design to change directions abruptly. Last the movie has women pilots in the plot unlike Top Gun although I disagree with choosing a woman in the role of a bad guy.".

I don't remember exactly the plot of Top Gun maybe because there wasn't one   but I'm sure that this movie is much better than Top Gun. And no I'm not saying that because I'm European ! Why ? First because it has an outstanding cinematography  the landscapes are various the Alps the sea the desert and even Paris and beautifully caught by the camera  they never shot anything if there wasn't the kind of clouds they wanted for example !The best aspect of this movie is without any doubt the formidable camera angles. In Top Gun they mostly used cameras on the ground and special effects for the cockpit scenes. In this movie everything is shot from five cameras in a modified pod on a jet fighter and the result is absolutely breathtaking ! The technique they used to shot the actors in the cockpit is not the same as the Tony Scott film  in Top Gun it's the camera that rotates around the actor in this movie the actors and the camera were on some kind of elevator with an articulated arm that can rotates in all directions so that they were upside down and shaken like in a simulator ! The result is way more convincing and believable after the blue screen is replaced with the superb images.The plot is also quite good although it's still an action movie ! There's a lot of humor and the cast delivers a good performance... And finally the soundtrack is always well chosen  The ambient mood music beautifully reinforces the feeling of lightness and calm when the planes are flying high in the clouds and on the other hand the rock music matches perfectly with the thrilling dogfight scenes ! What else do you ask to that kind of movie ? For me the only problem is the end wich I will not disclose here  in my opinion it's too abrupt I was expecting something bigger and longer... But it's still a good one.Overall a good movie for everyone  8 out of 10 !".

	schema:reviewBody "A French aerialaction flick packed with fast jets quick tempered pilots and the usual array of loveinterests. Many have compared 'Les Chevaliers du ciel' to the 1986 US box office blockbuster Top Gun. Film fans bang on about 'this lax French copy'  but it's not a copy it's a completely different film altogether. Different plot and different characters. It just happens to feature the French Air Force whereas Top Gun was based on the US Navy.In my honest opinion 'Les Chevs' it's international title being Sky Fighters is a very plausible film. If you ignore the weak female characters and their individual interwoven storylines then the 97 minute film motors along quite happily. Then you discover that the director is one Grard Pirs the man responsible for delivering 'Riders' and 'Double Zero'. For anyone who saw either of these stablemates may recall British actor Bruce Payne's fingernail scraping American accent in 'Riders' and then there was the farcical 'Double Zero'  a French spy comedy film. It was obvious that a large slice of the combined budgets went towards lunch.'Les Chevaliers du ciel' has a fairly reasonable story a new French fighter jet the Mirage 2000 is hijacked on the tarmac at the Farnborough Airshow in the UK. Two French fighter jets are sent to intercept the stolen aircraft as it flies towards the French coast. Our two heros are flying the interceptors Benot Magimel as Capt Antoine Walk'n Marchelli and his sidekick Capt Sbastien Fahrenheit Vallois played by Clovis Cornillac. They end up in a multitude of trouble but go on to save the day when a naughty little intergovernmental plot is revealed.Such is the advancement in filming technology and special effects in the 19 years since Top Gun was made this particular flick contains some very impressive aerial sequences. What many fail to realise is that the flying sequences in Top Gun were mainly filmed from the ground whereas in 'Les Chevs' it was mostly airborne. With 21st Century kit like the Spacecam and the Vectorvision Jet Camera what you see is what actually happened. By strapping this new technology to the underbelly of another fighter jet the aerial sequences have you in the Martin Baker seat of ejection happiness.

	onyx:emotionText "A French aerialaction flick packed with fast jets quick tempered pilots and the usual array of loveinterests. Many have compared 'Les Chevaliers du ciel' to the 1986 US box office blockbuster Top Gun. Film fans bang on about 'this lax French copy'  but it's not a copy it's a completely different film altogether. Different plot and different characters. It just happens to feature the French Air Force whereas Top Gun was based on the US Navy.In my honest opinion 'Les Chevs' it's international title being Sky Fighters is a very plausible film. If you ignore the weak female characters and their individual interwoven storylines then the 97 minute film motors along quite happily. Then you discover that the director is one Grard Pirs the man responsible for delivering 'Riders' and 'Double Zero'. For anyone who saw either of these stablemates may recall British actor Bruce Payne's fingernail scraping American accent in 'Riders' and then there was the farcical 'Double Zero'  a French spy comedy film. It was obvious that a large slice of the combined budgets went towards lunch.'Les Chevaliers du ciel' has a fairly reasonable story a new French fighter jet the Mirage 2000 is hijacked on the tarmac at the Farnborough Airshow in the UK. Two French fighter jets are sent to intercept the stolen aircraft as it flies towards the French coast. Our two heros are flying the interceptors Benot Magimel as Capt Antoine Walk'n Marchelli and his sidekick Capt Sbastien Fahrenheit Vallois played by Clovis Cornillac. They end up in a multitude of trouble but go on to save the day when a naughty little intergovernmental plot is revealed.Such is the advancement in filming technology and special effects in the 19 years since Top Gun was made this particular flick contains some very impressive aerial sequences. What many fail to realise is that the flying sequences in Top Gun were mainly filmed from the ground whereas in 'Les Chevs' it was mostly airborne. With 21st Century kit like the Spacecam and the Vectorvision Jet Camera what you see is what actually happened. By strapping this new technology to the underbelly of another fighter jet the aerial sequences have you in the Martin Baker seat of ejection happiness. A pod containing 4 cameras captured the forward rear and sidetoside action making for a fascinating insight into the sheer joy of punching your way through a cloud bank.The film naturally has to have a love interest  or 3  as in this case.

Well okay the F14 looks a lot cooler than the Mirages but well the flying was still awesome But everything besides that was simply bad. Story had plenty of holes I didn't like the actors and at least the German translation of the movie was horrible. I really really hope the original dialog is better because this version was just stupid from beginning to end Also the ending seemed really rushed and not well thought out. Again if you liked Top Gun for the pictures in the sky 'Sky Fighters' might be good for you but do not expect anything besides that!".

Well okay the F14 looks a lot cooler than the Mirages but well the flying was still awesome But everything besides that was simply bad. Story had plenty of holes I didn't like the actors and at least the German translation of the movie was horrible. I really really hope the original dialog is better because this version was just stupid from beginning to end Also the ending seemed really rushed and not well thought out. Again if you liked Top Gun for the pictures in the sky 'Sky Fighters' might be good for you but do not expect anything besides that!";

As is of custom of french cinema has dialogues even more wordy then expected in the genre and tries to stage a believable scenery for the action. But for certain it isn't for the intrigue or the inevitable romance that Les Chevaliers du Ciel distinguishes itself it is because of the spectacular aerial scenes that kicks down badly with their hands tied its American predecessor.During an aerial show a Mirage 2000 runs away in the middle of the demonstration hides from the radar flying above a passenger Airbus 340 and opens fire on the pilots that goes to investigate the occurrence. The film proposes that this is going to be the new plan of terror graduate from civil to military aviation  and if somebody thinks that it will be used bearded man wearing turbans for this kind of operation better think again. All the action sequences of Le Chevalier du Ciel were made on the heat of the moment with real jet fighters and no digital additives. They are besides that singularly wellplanned and make great use of the clouds mountains and cities including Paris  reference points that accent to the limit the sensation of vertigo proportioned by the extreme high speed maneuvers. With a propaganda so efficient as the common European product it is not admiring that the movie counted with all the good will of the military and french aerial trusts.

Office smokers now have to take their cigarette breaks on the streets outside which has led to groups of smokers from the same building bonding together in cliques known as hot pot packs. In an alley packed with loudmouth coworkers spreading the daily gossip Jimmy a mildmannered advertising executive meets cosmetics salesgirl Cherie. An awkward flirtation ensues amidst their afternoon nicotine rush. As their mutual infatuation intensifies the couple moves farther and farther away from the rest of the hot pot pack into their own private alley where they have conversations of unexpected emotional depth.

It's an us against the world but that doesn't faze them at all. In need of a light? Well someone at the box will gladly assist you. Need another stick but have smoked your last? Somebody else can offer you one. For free. And not to mention the many talkcocksingsong sessions that occur where the yellow box has evolved into a bona fide grapevine for news jokes and gossips to be traded. This yellow box bonding is much envied.But of course that isn't reason enough to convert me but it sure is reason enough for Hong Kong director Pang Hocheung to weave a romantic comedy based on this premise and he does so with much aplomb in the opening scene being a direct result that it just grabs you and holds your attention all the way until the end with an astute sense and insightful capture of the essence and psyche of the modern day dating game. Being a young though established director he combines the inthing of today's technology with SMS and doctored Facebook profile pictures into a commentary of sorts about the games people play when looking for love.Hong Kong too has similar strict regulations in the areas where one can smoke and these are all explained in the film. Ho uses them as a social background to weave the story of two characters  the English title is nowhere remotely close to the Chinese one which is Jimmy and Cherie named after the two characters played by Shawn Yue and Miriam Yeung in a sort of Romeo and Juliet fashion and the likes. They meet at one of the smoking areas where they trade stories with folks from other parts of the neighbourhood and soon become fast friends hitting it off almost instantaneously after cosmetics salesgirl Cherie learns of the unfortunate infidelity of ad executive Jimmy's soon to be ex girlfriend which provides enormous punctuations of laughter since she and others not supposed to be in the loop are sworn to secrecy.Despite their age gap in real life as well which is made explicitly known in the narrative both Shawn and Miriam last seen on screen some 3 years ago with Hooked on You another Hong Kong romantic comedy I dig share a lovable natural chemistry which is hallmark of any great romance despite roadblocks placed in their way like current relationships gone sour and the questioning of the What If when someone else who does seem more like one's soulmate comes along. Unravelling itself over seven consecutive days we follow these two wonderfully crafted characters as they hit it off and quietly root for them to come together though it's no mean feat almost reminiscent of anyone's experience in a relationship when the beginning phase seems pretty awesome until expectations start settling in and the mind games start to creep in.The jokes here are laugh a minute when the director gets his story to deliver punchline after punchline which worked almost all the time and shows his unique knack at pace and knowing what works. Included are some documentaryreel like clips containing faux pas interviews with the characters which while a tangent from the main narrative contains plenty of riproaring revelations that continue all the way until during the end credits which contains those which don't exactly fit into the main narrative proper. The main theme from the soundtrack is also beautiful to listen to and becomes instant earworm.This is another winner from Pang Hocheung and is definitely highly recommended. I think it'll make its way to Singapore despite the focus on the smokes with some redeeming factors but surely this is one film that will lose out tremendously if dubbed in Mandarin since the colourful fastandfuriously deliveredonlyinCantonese swear phrases will lose their shine the audience was just going nuts!. Oh and thanks to this film I will also want to try out the dryice toilet bowl effect nothing like taking a heavenly dump!".

There's much camaraderie and banter  liberally laced with profanity  among the hot pot pack that includes a man with round glasses a girl with a knit cap a Pakistani pizza man a little uniformed hotel bellman  and the couple tobe Jimmy Shawn Yue and Cherie Miriam Yeung Chin Wah. The movie begins with a dramatization of a shaggy dog story about a man locked in car trunk in a parking lot who turns out to be a ghost. There's a lot of joking round and things stay very light becoming just a little romantic when Jimmy joins Cherie at a costume birthday party at a Karaoke bar  except Cherie turns out to have a boyfriend KK Jo Kuk.Eventually he finds out about Jimmy and we see how much fun he and Cherie are having together and he gets jealous. Love in a Puff shows how romantic text messaging can be  and how it can give away secrets if spied on. And when Cherie decides to switch to Jimmy's network so her SMS fees aren't too high Jimmy's cohorts at work say she's too aggressive. Jimmy has just had a breakup with a girlfriend at work and Cherie is older. These are the givens that do nothing but fuel the mutual attraction.This movie excels in its constant interplay of lightness and seriousness in the way the milieu and the social world is sketched in and in the great chemistry between Yeung and Yue. Their dialogue is breezy and sometimes touching. Dialogue in group scenes is feisty and provocative by sometimes strict Hong Kong standards Love in a Puff caused some controversy which could add to its hip gloss for locals. Some of the whimsy recalls romantic moments in Wong Karwai but it's all more mundane but enough to show that Wong's tropes are far from unique and sometimes come from Hong Kong pop culture. If only Pang had taken more breaks from the sitcom charm and stepped back a bit he might have created a bit more magic. There is a bit of that with a silhouetteandfullmoon sequence of Cherie at the 80minute mark when the story reaches its makeorbreak getserious point. At film's end the couple come to some kind of commitment with Jimmy's Land Rover stalled on an overpass appropriately enough by making serious plans to both give up smoking and focus on each other. The apparent triviality of the subject matter along with the modern urban couple's difficulty with communication despite multiple platforms is offset by wit and keen observation of little details every step of the way. This light cinematic amusing movie is appealing and fresh  and has an assured polish along with casual touches like the little smallscreen 16mm interviews that serve as occasional commentary. All in all Love in a Puff is a delightful little piece of fluff as casual as its lovers try to be. One online critic listed it as one of his top movies of 2010 and characterized it as forgettable in an unforgettable way and that's about right. Local commentaries say the film won't work dubbed in Mandarin because its Cantonese profanities are untranslatable and had the audiences in stitches throughout. Subtleties apart the English titles give a fair sense of this pungency. Some little SMS tricks emerge too for instance if you type i n 55!W ! it looks like nonsense or code but turn the phone upside down and it reads I MISS U! Of such details are Puff's flavor and charm made. After its initially rocky debut in Hong Kong due to its profanity and heavy nicotine use Love in a Puff has breezed along the festival route appearing in Seattle Melbourne Tokyo Palm Springs landing in April 2011 at the San Francisco International Film Festival where it was screened for this review. The original Chinese title is Chi ming yu chun giu which means simply Jimmy and Cherie. I was not previously familiar with the work of this prolific 2000's Hong Kong director.".

	schema:headline " Move Thee Reviews Far From Perfect";
	schema:reviewBody "Love in a Puff is a lighthearted romantic comedy examining typical romantic relationships in Hong Kong nowadays. It starts creatively and ends with a catchy song. However the film is far from perfect because of several reasons.First the story with some witty and authentic dialogue is not flawless. That Cherie leaves her boyfriend whom she has been with for 5 years because of a newly met male friend she fancies simply does not convince me. Her character should at least experience some emotional turmoil when she makes the decision. Also it is unlikely for her to go to a motel with Jimmy with her luggage. Instead she should look for a place to settle in first. Apart from this the twist at the end seems unlikely.Second although Miriam Yeung is able to perform naturally her character is not three dimensional enough to showcase her acting skills. Judging from her character's tone and choice of words the audience only sees Miriam instead of Cherie in the movie. Miriam's character should be called Miriam. Moreover the scene in which she argues with her husband in the bedroom is devoid of tension which is a solid proof of her average performance.Third the use of foul language is slightly over the top. After watching the movie I cannot help but ask if it is necessary for most characters a health inspector included to use foul language so often. It seems to me that the movie is stereotyping smokers as foulmouthed. By the way it is interesting to observe that some members of the audience burst into laughter whenever a character uses foul language. In other words this kind of joke does not work on everybody.Fourth the interviews are insignificant and insipid. Indeed most of the things they talk about in the interviews are not thoughtprovoking. Besides is it necessary to show the boom mic intentionally in every interview?On the whole Love in a Puff at times has a subtle insight into romantic relationships in Hong Kong nowadays whereas it is far from perfect.".

	schema:reviewBody "A light hearted and carefree RomCom of the year... Director Pang Ho Cheung rarely disappoints and his latest venture in Love in a Puff is suitably far less selfindulgence and more carefree and fun to watch. Together with the witty and interesting dialogue cowritten by last year High Noon's Heiward Mak Pang paces the film in almost real time fashion. From the sense of a throwback to Woody Allen's classic Annie Hall by breaking the third wall with characters talking about love life fate and smoking to the real time technique similar to the elegantly viewed Before Sunrise. Pang has created a little masterpiece slightly underrated easy to go under the radar but simply a movie for film lovers to embrace. Love in a Puff is the kind of film that isn't overtly directed but rather the actors are allowed space to express themselves in realtime effect. Meeting people at a random ashcan in the back alleyway of Hong Kong is easily believable. After all for all you smokers out there how easy is it to share a light or two with a complete stranger with the possibility of striking up a laugh or two? The answer is yes. Pang plays with these premises and goes to the extreme in depicting smokers and constantly smoking. Smoking is what connected them in the first place and former queen of comedy Miriam Yeung glows in her role as a matured yet simple girl torn between the end of a current relationship and the hope of beginning a new one. Likewise Shawn Yue gives a career progressing performance as her younger love interest. Despite their best efforts on screen the duo just somehow never clicks. While the dialogue and interaction between the two is more than interesting the only evident problem is the lack of chemistry between the two leads. Surely their age difference was taken into account during the movie but there is something that just stops the duo from kicking in the romantic sparkles. Good friends  yes but lovers  a definite nono. All in all Love in a Puff might just feel like a lesser Pang Ho Cheung's effort but in fact it is exactly that carefree and fun feeling which makes this film better than it should be. It is also a return to the trashy witty light hearted fun not seen since his earlier works. It might not mean much but Love in a Puff is easily the most enjoyable and carefree and light hearted RomCom of the year...Neo 2010 I rate it 810www.thehkneo.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Love in a Puff has a lot about it that I really enjoy. For starters it was just the right amount of quirky. It was unique without needing to be obnoxious. There were a lot of moments that were heartwarming and fun to witness as the two main characters grew more infatuated with one another. I also enjoyed how the film portrayed love as a very nuanced emotion. It wasn't sappy in fact it was quite realistic in portraying how far from perfect love or what we think of as love can be. The film didn't try to rush a love story neatly packaged in 1 hour and 44 minutes. Instead it simply introduces us to the potential beginnings of a partnership.Miriam Chin Wah Yeung gave an incredibly endearing performance. Her facial expressions in particular caused her to stand out among the rest of the cast. I went into this movie not knowing anything about it. Within the first few minutes I was immediately drawn to her character. This was before I knew she was one of the main characters. She didn't even have very many lines in the beginning but her expressions really drew me in and made me want to know more about her. That being said there was a lot about the movie that I did not enjoy. They tried to mix an interviewstyle documentary in with the rest of the film not being done in documentary style. This was never explained. We never find out who the interviewers are why they're interviewing our characters and how they were supposed to tie into the story. It seemed like a cheap way to reveal the characters backstories and opinions. An interesting premise but ultimately I feel it fell short. Another thing I wasn't fond of was how unnecessarily mean our main duo could be. There is a scene where Jimmy is unabashedly rude as he describes one of Cherie's friends as an ugly toad. Instead of sticking up for her friend Cherie just holds back laughter. This scene really didn't do anything to further the plot. It was just cruel. Even as the poor girl cries from being stood up on a date Jimmy openly laughs at her and Cherie continues to not stick up for her supposed friend. These aren't the type of characters I like to root for personally.So really I'm not sure how I feel about this film. There was a lot that was done right and some truly charming moments. But also some notsocharming moments as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Time Out Hong Kong gives this delightful romcom five stars out of six calling it director PANG Hocheung's minor masterpiece for good reasons. While smoking provides the general backdrop and you do see an awful lot of puffing on screen to place too much emphasis on this aspect would be missing the point. What Pang did was making clever use of the introduction of the indoor smoking ban legislation as a vehicle to sketch the contemporary environment and lifestyle of the urban latetwentyish and thirtyish. Nor should the contemporary nature of the courtship game be overemphasized. What you see that Pang has deftly depicted is the heandshe game that has been going on since the beginning of civilization hideandseek coyandbold hardtoget and all these variations. He has however done a fantastic job in bringing you right into the middle of the contemporary world.While Director Pang deserves a lot of credit he had help. One is Heiward Mak talented young director whose debut High noon 2008 has received wild acclaim. She is invited by Pang to be the coscriptwriter providing no doubt the most valuable angle from the fairer sex. Another is Roy Szeto who is sort of the consultant on how the new generation generally behaves particularly in the department of obscenity languagewise. I am not kidding and I do not worry about a libel suit from Szeto because this is properly on record in the public domain a radio interview with Director Pang. In fact this has been quite an issue because the movie is rated Category III the R equivalent solely because of the swearing case in point of the absolutely absurd rating system or witless people who exercise it but likely both. If you go by their yardstick Martin Scorsese's The departed should have been completed banned and Mark Wahlberg locked up for life! Enough venting. Love in a puff is everything you would want in a romcom witty and funny brisk and breezy believable and likable characters innovative narration tender as well as hilarious moments and at times quite insightful. The two leads Miriam Yeung and Shawn Yue take the movie along capably while people in the supporting cast have their own moments too. And yes Roy Szeto is one of them giving a pitchperfect portrayal of the contemporary educated and liberated corporate animal. Highly recommended.".

What Pang did was making clever use of the introduction of the indoor smoking ban legislation as a vehicle to sketch the contemporary environment and lifestyle of the urban latetwentyish and thirtyish. Nor should the contemporary nature of the courtship game be overemphasized. What you see that Pang has deftly depicted is the heandshe game that has been going on since the beginning of civilization hideandseek coyandbold hardtoget and all these variations. He has however done a fantastic job in bringing you right into the middle of the contemporary world.While Director Pang deserves a lot of credit he had help. One is Heiward Mak talented young director whose debut High noon 2008 has received wild acclaim. She is invited by Pang to be the coscriptwriter providing no doubt the most valuable angle from the fairer sex. Another is Roy Szeto who is sort of the consultant on how the new generation generally behaves particularly in the department of obscenity languagewise. I am not kidding and I do not worry about a libel suit from Szeto because this is properly on record in the public domain a radio interview with Director Pang. In fact this has been quite an issue because the movie is rated Category III the R equivalent solely because of the swearing case in point of the absolutely absurd rating system or witless people who exercise it but likely both. If you go by their yardstick Martin Scorsese's The departed should have been completed banned and Mark Wahlberg locked up for life! Enough venting. Love in a puff is everything you would want in a romcom witty and funny brisk and breezy believable and likable characters innovative narration tender as well as hilarious moments and at times quite insightful. The two leads Miriam Yeung and Shawn Yue take the movie along capably while people in the supporting cast have their own moments too. And yes Roy Szeto is one of them giving a pitchperfect portrayal of the contemporary educated and liberated corporate animal. Highly recommended.";

To go from My name's Cherie through moving out of the premises and bond of one relationship to I'm simple and straightforward in seven days requires a brisk pace.

There is a time or two where it seems like a little exposition might have ended up on the cutting room floor but maybe things are clearer in the original language and subtitles short of an essay couldn't translate it. Most of the screen time is devoted to the main protagonists garnished with a handful of side characters and set pieces that don't detract from the lit up screen chemistry required of all good RomComs and provided by Yeung and Yue.

	schema:reviewBody "Produced under Andy Lau's Focus Films with actor Lau Kar Tung on board as producer directors Clement Cheng and Derek Kwok have a winner on their hands as they exalt the spirit of what it means to never give up when the odds are stacked against you and in some way live up that spirit of theirs when they had embarked to make this project which had clear risks. It will be extremely foolish to dismiss the film outright just because it has more elderly actors than youthful ones to draw the crowd because as the adage goes the oldest ginger is still the best and this film is a testament to that. Look closely and you'll see the sheer amount of veteran legendary talent even assembled who hail from the Shaw Brothers kung fu film era with even the opening credits with the silhouette fights and the way characters are introduced paying certain homage to an era bygone.In essence this purely Hong Kong film is an allegory of sorts to its peers in the market where packaging and marketing are seen to be the beallandendall rather than to rely on hard work to hone talent or to compensate for the lack thereof. It tells of a people's indomitable spirit of not backing down and to keep one's chin up in the face of tremendous competition to work at what they are good at and all will likely and hopefully be well.As the story goes we follow the adventures of Cheung Wong You Nam a lifelong loser who gets bullied from the get go in his life and gets sent by his real estate company to a remote town to assist in acquiring leases from the townsfolk so that redevelopment works can start. Naturally he gets bullied and gets rescued by the mysterious Tiger Leung SiuLung a disciple of the once great Master Ben Law Teddy Robin of the Gate of Law martial arts school who has been in coma for the last 30 years. And it seems like in Stephen Chow's Kung Fu this small town hides a lot more martial arts exponents such as Law's other disciple Dragon Chen KuanTai who together with Tiger had tried their best to keep their Master's place alive by converting it to a Teahouse while awaiting Ben's recovery.Then there's Kwai JJ Jia the pretty lass who also hangs out at the Law's teahouse. Their collective backstory is something that got delivered through a fantastic animated sequence and animation is something that gets peppered throughout the film as well when it gets down to fight sequences when deadly bone crunching blows get delivered. Since the film has in its plot the advent of the Hong Kong Martial Arts Open to seemingly promote the spirit of martial arts as announced by rival and owner of a flashier sports club Master Pong Chan Mai Wan one will expect some spectacular kung fu action. The film more than delivers in this aspect with the action choreographed by the renowned Yuen Tak who cleverly did away with fancy wirework offering instead sparring sessions which are realistic and extremely riveting to watch as the actors most of whom have so many years of experience put together some credible and exciting martial arts moves for the screen. Editing is also wonderfully done so that we get the best views at the front seats of a bout without the usual MTVstyled quick editing nonsense. I guarantee no matter how many martial arts films that you've seen the ones here as choreographed will still blow your mind away.Like a Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon itself if you do not buy the first act then wait for Teddy Robin who singlehandedly stole the show right out from everyone's noses. His comic timing is perfect and the lines that he has sheer wit coupled with the fact that his character's disorientation after being out of action for so many years is something that offers riproaring laughter. The directors who cowrote the story with Frankie Tam breathe so much life into Master Law that you can't help but on one hand be amazed by his crazy philosophy and on the other just laugh at it such as his proclaimed laws of combat in the order of Guts Power and Skill the rationale in his disciple recruitment strategy and chiefly that the reason to learn Kung Fu is to fight not exercise  which has other better alternatives. Robin who also contributed to the movie's music fills his character with so much youthful energy and exuberance makes this one of his more memorable roles that he has tackled and left everyone in the cinema crackling with glee each time he turns on his wit.As the film explains early on the boxing ring is a symbol of dignity and fame and there can be only one victor and one loser. Clearly Gallants is a winner in my books and delivers knockout blow after knockout blow without relent. I had come with a mission to watch Hong Kong films and this one clearly made my trip worthwhile many times over coupled with so many hilarious moments to laugh along with. I hope it makes it to Singapore so that I can watch this on the big screen again otherwise I'll patiently wait for its DVD release after it's done its theatrical and festival rounds. Highly recommended without a doubt one of the best amongst the festival offerings if I may say so!".

This movie has a magic moment that is so rare but so wonderful when it happens. Without the moment I'd rate it a 6 slightly above average for the genre and date. The moment bumps it up to a remarkable 8 out of 10. So what about that moment? When the fight is over and the loser is laughing the younger guy doesn't get it and the line is something like You'll get it in about 20 years. Simply put  I get it now. I've been a fan of these movies for a long time and I've practiced martial arts for 35 years. I have all the aches and pains and injuries to prove it. I am not as young or as good as I once was. That's exactly why I get it now and exactly why I liked it so much.";

Teddy Robin for example is very funny but he gets a bit annoying after a while.Bruce Leung Siulung still moves amazingly well at 57 yrs old.. better than most action stars in their 20's.JJ Jia is a dead ringer for Kwai Lun Mei.".

Just the title alone gives this cult status and all the ingredients are here for it being an extremely fun film to watch. Film starts out in a Filipino womans prison where a bunch of new inmates are put through orientation and they soon meet Warden Logan Laurie Burton and Matron Densmore Lynn Borden who are lesbian lovers but Densmore likes to bed the pretty new inmates. She has a secret peephole by the shower where she watches the ladies and masturbates. One night inmate Lee Daniels Pam Grier is propositioned by her but Lee tells her no. Later Lee meets a tall blond named Karen Brent Margaret Markov who is part of a bunch of revolutionaries and they plan on busting her out. While on a bus being transported to a work detail the Rebels ambush the bus and after some gunfire Lee and Karen escape. They are shackled together but don't like each other and they quarrel about which direction to go. The Rebels are headed by Ernesto Zaldy Zschornack and he tells his men that they must find Karen and will stop at nothing to get her back. Lee and Karen keep running and they knock out some nuns and steal they're gowns to try and sneak around the police. Meanwhile Captain Cruz of the police makes a deal with a ruthless bounty hunter named Ruben Sid Haig to help get the girls in exchange that the police will leave his illegal operations alone. Also Lee's exboyfriend is a gangster named Vic Vic Diaz and he wants Lee badly because she stole 40000 dollars from him.SPOILER ALERTFinally the Rebels catch up with them and they are reunited with Karen. They give Lee a ride to a pier where a friend is going to get her out of the area with his boat but when they get there Vic and his men are waiting and a vicious gun battle ensues. This film was directed by a pretty popular B movie director named Eddie Romero and he helmed many low budget horror films in the Phillipines. The story is written by a very young Jonathan Demme who two years later would direct his first film Caged Heat. This film is of course inspired by The Defiant Ones but the fun of these exploitation flicks is that they take on a popular theme and add all sorts of sleaze and mayhem. The characters are all written well and Haig steals the film with his cowboylike Ruben. He dresses like a cowboy and in one scene he threatens to shoot off the smallest penis between two men. Grier displays some of her tough quips to fellow inmate Markov like I don't care about that jive ass stuff referring to Markov's revolutionary politics. Markov's character is reminiscent of Patty Hearst and in one scene she tells Grier that she always had everything but wants to stay with the rebels. Film is full of gratuitous nudity and the shower scene at the beginning of the film lasts at least 5 minutes. They're is no quick glimpses here plenty of time for an eyeful! As far as exploitation films go this delivers the goods and the cast is excellent.".

Film is full of gratuitous nudity and the shower scene at the beginning of the film lasts at least 5 minutes. They're is no quick glimpses here plenty of time for an eyeful! As far as exploitation films go this delivers the goods and the cast is excellent.";

The movie's highlight is of course the great Pam Grier.Locked up in a brutal prison camp on a tropical island blonde revolutionary Karen BrentMargaret Markov and former black prostitute Lee Daniels Pam Grier are constantly having beef with each other. Chained together by the sadistic lesbian prison wardens the two escape from a con transport. Chased by henchmen of the druglord who used to have Lee locked up as a haremgirl gangsters and the police the two fugitives have different destinations. While Karen has to find her guerrilla friends Lee must reach a boat with a case full of cash. On the run the two have quite some fights but since they are chained together they have to get along.Black Mama White Mama is pretty violent and a typical exploitation flick lots of shootouts occasional torture many catfights and naked breasts. The acting in this movie differs. Pam Grier is great as always and so is sexy Margaret Markov as Karen. Sid Haig's performance as Ruben a slightly insane gangster in a cowboy outfit is another highlight in Black Mama White Mama and makes the movie a lot funnier. The rest of the acting is nothing special typical Bmovie performances some better some worse. A fan of Pam Grier and lover of blaxploitation classics like Coffy as well as films like Jackie Brown I found Black Mama White Mama very entertaining. Not one of Pam Grier's best movies but better than most 'Women's prison' flicks this is a violent and fun film and definitely worth watching.".

	schema:headline " Too violent and clichridden.";
	schema:reviewBody "The plot for Black Mama White Mama revolves around two female inmates at a women's prison in the Phillipines. One Black and one White. These two women are thrown together in the prison. Pam Grier is Lee Daniels Lee is incarcerated in the hellish women's prison for dancing as a harem girl. Lee's boyfriend owes her part of his profits from his drugdealing activities. Lee is mainly interested in breaking out of the prison to get hold of her beau's drug money so that she can leave the Phillipines and assume a better life. Margaret Markov plays Karen Brent a white women from a privileged background who is also a revolutionary. Karen has joined a group of revolutionaries determined to change the corrupt Phillipino political system. She's captured by Phillipino authorities and held as a political prisoner.The storyline takesoff when Karen and Lee break out of the prison they were in together. The two of them also happened to be chained together at the wrist. As they flee they also fight with each other because they have different goals to pursue. Naturally they hate being chained together. But they also realize that they must put aside their differences to help each other survive while they evade capture.If this film seems very similar to The Big Bird Cage it's because much of the cast in the two films is the same as well as their location in the Phillipines. Roger Corman has always had a consistent stable of actors that he used in all of his 70s B movies. Besides Pam Grier Sid Haig Roberta Collins Claudia Jennings Betty Anne Rees and William Smith were also among the many actors that were frequently cast in Corman's AIP films.Like The Big Bird Cage Black Mama White Mama relies on too much gory violence to be palatable. Pam Grier conveys her usual tough chick persona in this film and shows her competence as a female action heroine. Margaret Markov is less effect in her portrayal of the revolutionary Karen. She just seems to fragile and wellcoiffed to be a dedicated political guerrilla. Except for Sid Haig as the colorful Ruben the rest of the cast is forgettable.This film has little entertainment value unless excessive heinous acts of violence are your thing. Only the performances by Pam Grier and Sig Haig make this film worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "From story authors Jonathan Demme  Joe Viola screenwriter H.R. Christian and the prolific Eddie Romero comes this diverting Filipino chase movie that puts an exploitative spin on the premise of The Defiant Ones.It starts out as your average women in prison flick with blonde revolutionary Karen Brent Margaret Markov and black prostitute Lee Daniels Pam Grier meeting. While escorted away from the prison they are shackled together. They soon make their break for freedom often arguing over methodology and directions but coming to rely on each other and even care for each other.Director Romero makes this a pretty lively affair and it's worth noting that things take on a rather tongue in cheek tone at times. The ample humour helps to make this quite easy to watch with Pams' frequent costar Sid Haig given a meaty role which he plays with relish a flamboyant horny loud talking dude in a cowboy costume. Romeros' pacing is effective and the action scenes are fairly intense there are some brief bursts of bloody violence. The location shooting is excellent and the supporting cast features some familiar faces from Filipino exploitation cinema Eddie Garcia Alfonso Carvajal Bruno Punzalan and the always welcome Vic Diaz who's a hoot as an oily crime lord. Sexy Lynn Borden has the role of a lustful prison guard. Stars Markov and Grier look fantastic and get some great chemistry going.The true highlight of the movie definitely has to be the sequence where Markov and Grier masquerade as nuns it provides the biggest laughs. But it must be said that Romero knows how to get down to business delivering delectable nudity in the obligatory shower scene that occurs no more than four minutes into the movie.All in all this is solid entertainment that should please fans of the A.I.P. drivein flicks of the 1970s.Seven out of 10.".

The location shooting is excellent and the supporting cast features some familiar faces from Filipino exploitation cinema Eddie Garcia Alfonso Carvajal Bruno Punzalan and the always welcome Vic Diaz who's a hoot as an oily crime lord. Sexy Lynn Borden has the role of a lustful prison guard. Stars Markov and Grier look fantastic and get some great chemistry going.The true highlight of the movie definitely has to be the sequence where Markov and Grier masquerade as nuns it provides the biggest laughs. But it must be said that Romero knows how to get down to business delivering delectable nudity in the obligatory shower scene that occurs no more than four minutes into the movie.All in all this is solid entertainment that should please fans of the A.I.P. drivein flicks of the 1970s.Seven out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "If you're a fan of either early Pam Grier or 70s WomeninPrison WIP flicks I'm sure this plot synopsis will sound eerily familiar Two women are taken to an allwomen's prison in the middle of the jungle in some unnamed Banana Republic. There the women are forced to endure physical torture unwanted sexual situations and working in the fields. With very little provocation the two women become enemies and start a fight in the prison cafeteria. More scenes of torture until the women decide to work together to make their escape only to have what seems like everyone police gangsters bounty hunters revolutionaries on their trail. It's like dj vu all over again. As far as WIPexploitation films go Black Mama White Mama is neither the best nor worst I've seen. It's just about average. Other than having the two main characters chained together which isn't really that novel an idea no new ground is broken in this film. Most everything is standard clich. For example it takes less than 5 minutes of the movie's runtime for what I call The Required WIP Shower Scene. This one comes complete with a guard ogling the women through a peephole. How original! Black Mama White Mama left me with one burning question  how were these two women able to change clothes including dressing like nuns while chained together? It seems impossible to me.".

I've seen quite a few womeninprison movies and this character is a constant in almost all of them but usually they are played by women who are more butch than the sexy Ms. Borden. Pretty Laurie Burton plays the somewhat nicer matron who is lovers with Borden but doesn't approve of her side action. Too bad these two aren't in the whole movie. I'd probably rate it higher just for them.The first halfhour is pretty much what you expect from a womeninprison flick. There's nice eye candy with many lovely ladies showing what they've got. None lovelier than the foxy Pam of course. There's a shower scene cat fights teases of lesbianism and sadism. But most of the movie is the two women on the run not in the prison.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a big fan of Jack Hill's pair of Pam Grierlead women in prison flicks The Big Doll House and The Big Bird Cage and was hoping for something similar from this film seeing as it has similar people involved with it. It has to be said that Black Mama White Mama is nowhere near as good as the earlier two films and also isn't as good as the plot summary would leave me to believe it is...but it is at least an entertaining exploitation effort. The film's central idea is really good and could easily have lead to a classic but unfortunately the film adds in a number of side plots and these unfortunately are not as interesting. We of course focus on a women's prison and in particular two prisoners that don't get on one black one white. Their superiors decide to ship them off to another prison and for extra security they are chained together. The white prisoner is involved with a revolution and her friends attack the convoy carrying the prisoners en route and the pair is able to escape. Now chained together they have to battle their way across the countryside.Naturally the film has the same brash exploitation style which includes a food fight and the obligatory shower scene as Jack Hill's women in prison films but it's clear that Eddie Romero is no Jack Hill and it comes off looking more like an imitation than the real thing. Pam Grier once again gives a gritty turn as one half of the lead and gets good back up from Margaret Markov the other half. There's also a small role for Sid Haig who plays a gangster. The parts of the film that focus on the prisoners are generally good and entertaining and I'm sure this would have been a classic if the whole film focused on that idea. The side plot involving Sid Haig is not too bad and has some interesting moments but the whole plot revolving around a revolution is frankly dull and I found it very hard to care for. The setting is rather nice once again it's some banana republic and there's some good location shots at least. Overall I would recommend this film to anyone that likes the work that Jack Hill did with Pam Grier but don't go into it expecting anything on par.".

	schema:headline " You would think that a women in prison movie would be an automatic disaster";
	schema:reviewBody "And you'd be right. Black Mama White Mama also known as 'Women in Chains' is exactly the kind of trashy and crappy bmovie that the premise suggests. Pam Grier has been thrown into a prison on a small island with a lot of other women and this place seriously makes the summer camp where Martha Stewart is locked up right now look like a maximumsecurity prison. It's not five minutes into the movie that one of the hottie guards utters the line 'Strip 'em and get 'em wet' and then we are introduced to a prison life that resembles some college freshman's fantasy of what the inside of a sorority house is like. The prisoners soap and rub and wrestle with each other in the shower like it's a Girls Gone Wild shoot then they all hang out together in their dorm openly smoking pot and discussing in a big group what would be the best ways to escape. I've never been to prison myself but I have a feeling that escape plans are the kind of thing that you want as few people as possible to know about prisoners or guards or otherwise. The biggest difference between this prison life and some fantasy sorority life is that the women in this movie all wear orange cardigans and no pants. Go figure that say PRISON on the back. Must be those generic prison outfits for prisons that can't afford pricey accessories like their prison name or prisoner numbers for their uniforms.And as is to be expected a prison that can't afford to put prisoner identification on the backs of the uniforms can obviously not expect to be able to find guards that are interested in guarding the prisoners as much as they are in having sex with the prisoners and each other.The conflict of the movie's title refers to the fact that Lee Daniels Pam Grier spends much of the time handcuffed to a blonde prisoner named Karen as they are on the run from the cops after escaping from the prison. I won't go into details about how they escape except to say that you might have seen something like it in The Fugitive had they been unable to afford to stage a train wreck and it leads into the muddled story of the conflicting interests also chasing these two women for different reasons. Karen and Lee both have their own gangs of people each hoping to rescue their respective escaped prisoner and the cops are after both of them all the while.spoilers So Karen is involved with a bunch of hippies that want to Revolutionize Life As They Know It. Meanwhile Karen just wants to get off the island something she's been trying to do for years and isn't it just perfect that they each need to go to completely opposite sides of the island in order to fulfill their goals. So we get this odd couple pairing and since they are an odd couple it's not hard to predict that they will hate each other for the vast majority of the film but grow fond of each other by the end.In a movie with so many conflicting interests especially when those conflicting interests not only propel the two main characters in opposite directions as they pursue their goals it is not unreasonable to expect that there will be a climactic moment involving the rival gangs at some point in the movie. Not about to leave anyone unsatisfied they throw in a stupid gang standoff at the end of the movie where everyone shoots machine guns at each other killing each other en masse while the two women paddle safely and calmly across the river in a little boat. Nice. Even better at the end of the movie after a huge massacre in which lots of people get shot and spurt bright red paint all over the place the Captain of the police looks over the masses of dead criminals covered in awful awful special effects and we learn that he will be a Major before dinner. Not a bad way to end the movie the criminals all kill each other off and the cops get all the credit but here is the last line in the film  'It's better to win isn't it?' Is THAT why the Captain is going to get promoted to Major? Because he figured that out???".

	onyx:emotionText "And you'd be right. Black Mama White Mama also known as 'Women in Chains' is exactly the kind of trashy and crappy bmovie that the premise suggests. Pam Grier has been thrown into a prison on a small island with a lot of other women and this place seriously makes the summer camp where Martha Stewart is locked up right now look like a maximumsecurity prison. It's not five minutes into the movie that one of the hottie guards utters the line 'Strip 'em and get 'em wet' and then we are introduced to a prison life that resembles some college freshman's fantasy of what the inside of a sorority house is like. The prisoners soap and rub and wrestle with each other in the shower like it's a Girls Gone Wild shoot then they all hang out together in their dorm openly smoking pot and discussing in a big group what would be the best ways to escape. I've never been to prison myself but I have a feeling that escape plans are the kind of thing that you want as few people as possible to know about prisoners or guards or otherwise.

	schema:reviewBody "The fact that Adam Baldwin was in this movie was by itself enough of a reason for me to have ordered it from Amazon. But even better is that he is just one of several great actors in this film. Baldwin does an outstanding job as Mr. Tate who at first just seems young and reckless as Mr. Cohen implies but gradually goes into fullon psycho mode a transition that is very subtle and believable. Roy Scheider also does an excellent job portraying Mr. Cohen's insecurities and eventual despair.I very very much enjoyed the backandforth dynamic between the title characters and what fascinated me is how the situation into which they were forced shaped their relationship and attitudes toward each other. Mr. Cohen is an experienced hitman for the mob all business and resents the fact that the much younger Mr. Tate has been sent to help him with a job. Mr. Cohen sees this as the first nail in his coffin his days as a hitman are numbered and the mob doesn't have a very good retirement plan.The job the two are sent to do is to kill two witnesses  the FBI agents who guard them and to kidnap the son and take him to Texas for questioning. At first the job seems to have gone off rather well and Cohen  Tate are on their way to Texas with the kid Travis stowed in the backseat of their car. However Mr. Cohen criticizes Mr. Tate as being overzealous and using too many bullets where just one would do. Then Mr. Tate turns on the radio and we discover that Travis' dad whom Mr. Cohen shot was not actually murdered and is able to give a statement about what happened. This bad news sets off a whole chain of misfortunes for Cohen  Tate and their ideologies clash as they try to figure out how to best finish their original job of taking the boy back to Texas.At one point in the movie Cohen  Tate are laughing at some joke like two old buddies and I really wonder what their relationship could have been in different circumstances. The pair really could have made a great team but what separates them is Mr. Cohen's initial view of Mr. Tate as a rival and the fact that Travis pits them against one another in an attempt to escape from the hit men. And that's where the movie gets sticky for me. The kid who plays Travis is an excellent actor but I find the character himself rather annoying not to mention the plot line that a kid could manipulate two adult hit men in such a way that they would actually fight each other to the death is just completely incredible. I would have enjoyed this movie much more had the story not revolved around Travis.".

Travis had witnessed a mob rubout and now the employers of Cohen and Tate want to know everything that the kid knows before taking him out. The problem is nothing goes smooth because of the two opposing personalities in play here. Cohen is the Older and Wiser type very weary at having to put up with a hothead punk such as Tate the kind of guy who enjoys violence way too much. Travis soon notices this and realizes that his best chances for survival lie in attempting to pit them against one another.Eric Red screenwriter of The Hitcher and Near Dark made his feature length directing debut with this moderately interesting very well paced little film his version of the O. Henry story The Ransom at Red Chief. Most of the film takes place inside a car so he proves up to the challenge of shooting in a claustrophobic environment and keeping the audience involved in what is happening. As Cohen and Tate spend more and more time with each other things just get more and more grim and uneasy. Tate has shown his capacity for savagery and his quick temper and the increasingly more frustrated Cohen finds it harder and harder to maintain his self control. What is often truly disturbing is seeing guns repeatedly leveled at young Cross' head. You really fear for this kids' life.Right from the start Red is ratcheting up the suspense diving head first into the action. In an odd touch he gets his back story out of the way very quickly with a brief expository text. Then things soon get ugly. Red does an excellent job of keeping his tone grim throughout. Much of the effectiveness however can be attributed to the acting. Baldwin is a live wire in his part and young Cross delivers a sympathetic mature performance holding his own opposite his more experienced costars. Scheider is of course superb he's as commanding as ever as the professional killer saddled with a loose cannon partner. Cooper Huckabee The Funhouse is good in his brief screen time as Travis' father. Talents behind the camera include composer Bill Conti and cinematographer Victor J. Kemper.Cohen and Tate is good stuff and is worth seeking out or rediscovering for the cult movie aficionado.Seven out of 10.".

Only a few moments know to keep your interest. Because it's a road movie the movie is more or less more of the same all the time and becomes a bit tiresome to watch at moments.Problem is that there are too many moments were too little is happening. All the characters do at those moments are talking but the characters themselves just aren't good and interesting enough to grab your interest despite the good work from the actors themselves.Especially Roy Scheider did a good job in his role of aging and halve deaf hitmen. Adam Baldwin does what he can do best playing a psycho. Really would he had gotten this part if he hadn't played Animal Mother in Full Metal Jacket? His acting is still lacking but he did a good job though.It was a pretty good idea to let the kid set up the two hitmen against each other but it isn't really conceived good enough into the movie and besides it's just not really believable since a plan such as that needs subtlety and patience. Some things an 9 year old just neither has especially not when he is on his way of getting killed.Still pretty amazing to see how much talent got involved with this production. Victor J. Kemper's cinematography is really great at times and the movie features a couple of interesting compositions that should remind you of the '70's style of filmmaking. Perhaps there also lays a problem. The movie tries to be too much like a '70's movie in its pace. dialog action and basically everything else. Bill Conti's musical score is also sort of funny though since it sounds like it was composed for a much better movie. The score is overblown at times when there is basically very little happening on the actual screen.It's still an OK movie to watch but by no means a great movie or one worth searching out.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Adam Baldwin does what he can do best playing a psycho. Really would he had gotten this part if he hadn't played Animal Mother in Full Metal Jacket? His acting is still lacking but he did a good job though.It was a pretty good idea to let the kid set up the two hitmen against each other but it isn't really conceived good enough into the movie and besides it's just not really believable since a plan such as that needs subtlety and patience. Some things an 9 year old just neither has especially not when he is on his way of getting killed.Still pretty amazing to see how much talent got involved with this production. Victor J. Kemper's cinematography is really great at times and the movie features a couple of interesting compositions that should remind you of the '70's style of filmmaking. Perhaps there also lays a problem. The movie tries to be too much like a '70's movie in its pace. dialog action and basically everything else. Bill Conti's musical score is also sort of funny though since it sounds like it was composed for a much better movie. The score is overblown at times when there is basically very little happening on the actual screen.It's still an OK movie to watch but by no means a great movie or one worth searching out.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com";

The film opens with a devastating scene that still has the power to disturb and becomes a roller coaster ride into the nightmarish world of two hit men who kidnap a child witness to a mob murder. Roy Schieder is excellent as the the icecold Cohen.

	schema:reviewBody "With a momentary glance at the poster Cohen  Tate appears to be somewhere in the realm of those buddy cop thrillers that proved so popular in the 1980s with toughguy poses and its two central characters named right there in the title accompanied by an ampersand. At least that's the impression I got. In fact Eric Red's directorial debut is anything but. Part road movie and part tense thriller  and occasionally struggling when switching between the two  Cohen  Tate is a menacing violent and often plain mental neonoir with a chilling performance by Roy Scheider at its centre. Often veering into territory marked by the Coen Brothers Red who also wrote the script demands that you spend 90 minutes with two bickering coldblooded killers as the life of a child hangs in the balance. And it proves to be a pretty riveting experience even though it requires you to suspend your disbelief for the duration.We open at a farm house where a seemingly allAmerican family are in hiding for unexplained reasons. FBI agents surround the house but that doesn't stop hitmen Cohen Scheider and Tate Adam Baldwin from breaking in and murdering everyone in sight except the 9 yearold son Travis Harley Cross. Instead they whisk him away in their car to deliver him to their bosses. What they have in store for him is unknown as the eponymous antiheroes are as much in the dark as we are. Yet they have made a terrible blunder On the radio they learn that the father has survived and has already given descriptions of the killers to the police. The hotheaded Tate wants to ice the child right there and then but the wiser more level headed Cohen insists on finishing the job as planned. Sensing distrust between the two men Travis takes the opportunity to turn them against each other and plan his escape.The film plays out from there as a series of vignettes usually involving the increasingly volatile Tate going off the rails and threatening to kill young Travis. These screaming outbursts are repeated so often that it becomes unintentionally comical similar in many ways to Bill Paxton's overthetop character in Near Dark which was also written by Red. Scheider however subtly oozes menace. He may be the more balanced of the two but it's easy to believe that he's capable of executing a child. The meanspirited tone works in favour of the film which ultimately delivers its thrills most effectively when things turn really nasty. The majority of the action takes place in the claustrophobic confines of the car and the film's main strength is the sharp and often amusing dialogue between the titular bad men. It's ridiculous and messy but it's damn good fun any film in which a character eats a box of matches to prove how crazy they are is a winner in my book.".

He's got a talent and it readily shows here in this character driven tale that's entertaining all the way steered by two great performances of two hit men one a cold blooded professionalCohen the other a younger clumsy trigger happy sicko Tate. They're transporting a young boy a witness to a mobster hit back to some people who as Cohen states are probably going to kill him. What's impressive here is almost the entire movie takes place in the hitman's car where Mr Red has managed to make this work beautifully where the two men are pitted against each other beautifully mostly on account of the little boy witness Travis Knight talented kid actor Harley Cross who did a string of movies around this late 80's phase The movie works thanks to the two contrasting leads Cohen intriguing I must say where Tate was just reprehensible which versatile Baldwin plays with such professionalism this is one of one his best performances. The start of the film is indeed intense it really had me worried where you knew this family was gonna be gotten too. The last five minutes is impactfully climactic up until the brains blowed out finale. There is some raw heavy violence and our three leads successfully interact really made it. I've always loved this film but what's great which I admire if envy a little bit about it is the situations and complications that happen through the movie which too like the actions and decisions of all were so plausible and believable I could fault any of it. The roadblock scene and how it ensued I would say was explosively clever as Mr Red himself. Seek out this one and watch it I guaranteed you find it something rewardingly different and then you have the three actors who you truly must credit with acknowledgement.".

Two hit men one an aging pro CohenRoy Scheider the other a hotheaded and unstable rookie TateAdam Baldwingun down everyone except a boy named TravisHarley Cross who they are given strict orders to return to their mob boss in Houston. As we follow them on a road trip back to Houston Travis attempts to exploit the obvious volatile tensions between his two coldblooded kidnappers actually succeeding in turning the screw and capitalizing in taking advantage of a visible powder keg ready to disrupt. What amazed me about COHEN AND TATE was the fact that most of the entire film takes place inside a carwell actually two they eventually steal another after a harrowing road block escapeand yet Red finds ways thanks to his superb leads and the friction that develops as the road trip continues. Also fascinating is the fact that a child is able to become master manipulator and turn two hired killers against each other in order to survive. Baldwin is clearly unstable from the getgo unloading shotgun blasts into Travis' mom and always pleading with Cohen to kill the kid. Cohen establishes early on that he has always worked alone forced by the boss to take on a partner not exactly the most trustworthy or levelheaded at that. Cohen shoots Travis' father and doesn't see that he's dead which essentially leads to his downfall. Tate reacts accordingly when they discover that pops survived and this fact fuels his desire to shoot Travis. So we spend the rest of the running time wondering how long Tate will wait before trying to kill Travis as Cohen interferes over and over. The beauty of the film is how we see the three interact with each other particularly Cohen the old timerand Tate the unpredictable hoodlum. I think we can see that Tate may be only good at this role someone who kills people he doesn't know for a city mobster never named or given a face. It's not about why the kid is being taken to the mobsterthe reason is barely elaborated the kid may know something important the mobster needs to find out but how the youngster stirs the pot quite resourceful and bright. It's a testament to the actors that they can keep our attention while most of the time they argue and bicker inside a car the result we know will end badly. Great finale around Texas oil rigs not to mention the aforementioned road block where Cohen and Tate must avoid being arrested by deputies checking the cars of motorists.".

The screenplay plays with very few characters maybe due to the limitation of the budget the viewer knows that one of them is the serial killer but there is no clue along the story indicating who the criminal is. Although quite exaggerated when the mystery is disclosed I found the twist acceptable and I liked the open end. The character of the Sheriff is too much weird but maybe it was intentional to include him as a possible suspect. With regard to the highlighted goof the killer sucked the blood on the hammer therefore the blood has not disappeared from the hammer as mentioned in IMDb.

Some creepy things start to happening in this house and it slowly builds up to a climactic ending. Very much in the style of some of the 70s horror such as 'Amittyville Horror.' This isn't as good as that because the plot is very predictable after 30 years of such movies but it is worth watching.The one thing that stands out is the father and his relationship with Christina. I haven't seen any mention of this in the reviews I have read but the father seems to have an unnatural love for his daughter and she seems to know it but represses it. When she was washing the dishes at one point he told her something like 'you look good tonight Christina.' She clearly felt awkward and changed the subject.All in all I give this slightly above average suspense horror a 6 out of 10.

The story was relatively believable albeit misleading from the cover pic and plot synopsis on the back its not about a haunted house and the editing was again fair. Pros hot girls with revealing clothes throughout the ENTIRE movie definant  a couple of brief bare boobie shots again from our main character decent story and characters that you found yourself loving OK er more like liking and hating. Cons Overly predictable once you realize its not a haunted house. Crappyunrealistic props why does the deputy drive a 1988 Crown Vic with the old andy griffith dual light pods up top? How cheap is that Sheriffs Dept? and its fair share of boring down time. Anyway if you like B movies go to your local wally world and pick up this B gem for 5.50....its definitely worth that.

Her boyfriend is that guy from Roswell with the stickyup hair well at least he was till he died from a hammer to the temple. Anyway this was a decent horror film  not overly scary so that you don't want to walk to the toilet in the middle of the night lest a murderer get you  but creepy nonetheless. People died throughout and we didn't know who the killer was though there were only really two suspects and one was far too obvious and when we found out who he was insane. He licked the blood from his murder weapon ate a ladybird and had constructed a gruesome killing device. Plus the mum was freaky too. The very last shot was predictable but still effective.

The movie is at the first half a whodunnit Slasher but it keeps giving the audience hints about who could be the killer. First the jealous insecure boyfriend has some weird attitudes and even attacks Howie for no reason. Then the father who is a pervert and looks at his daughter as a sexual object performs some actions that could make you think he's a loony. Then we have Howie. The pretty boy who fixes the house but he really isn't a normal boy.If you haven't watched the movie give it a try it's not as bad as people say but it's not a good movie by any means. The plot is kind of interesting but predictable. Almost all the death scenes are offscreen you can discard gore in this one.Overall this is the kind of movie to watch while you are doing anything else. For example if you are chatting or talking over the phone with someone boring  Christina's House may be the perfect option. Allison Lange is really beautiful and can act. She should appear in more important movies.".

Tensions between her overbearing father Fred Savage and boyfriend Brendan Fehr exacerbate the situation and the arrival of an offbeat handyman Brad Rowe creates further riftsbut something deeper and far more disturbing lay in the depths of Christina's home.I saw this film over ten years ago and my memories of it were foggy I recalled the opening scene well but the rest of the film escaped me. I recently rewatched it and was mildly surprised by it. It is a Bhorror movie through and through but retains a respectable amount of class that protects it from falling into the utter sleaze or sobadyoucan'twatchit category. The cinematography is nice and the writing is surprisingly attentive and compelling. It had me personally guessing until the last act and though it is marred by some uneven pacing the film kept my attention.The main downfall to the entire thing comes down to the performances which range from decent to a mixture of decent and downright campy. Allison Lange has a good screen presence but her acting in the film is hitandmiss. Fred Savage's turn as the overbearing perverted father is bizarre and often overthetop while Brendan Fehr and Brad Rowe turn in average performances. Aside from some offbeat performances the bones of the film no pun intended are relatively solid. The script seems to be riffing on elements of Bob Clark's seminal Canadian thriller Black Christmas and the premise of the film works. Its final scene kicks it up another notch in my opinion adding an ambiguous layer of intrigue that leaves the audience with a thorn in their side that they'll have to pull out on their own.Overall Christina's House is a decent lowbudget horror flick that transcends its limitations for the most part. It is not a profound film but it is clever and at times somewhat creepy. It's a case where I definitely feel that had the filmmakers had a bit more money and a bit higher caliber of talent they could have pulled off something mildly extraordinary. At the end of the day the film is an entertaining and noble effort. 610.".

The saddest of all are some of those with mental illnesses who are surviving on medication to keep psychoses under control.Brendan Fraser is a Harvard undergraduate who is writing his senior thesis when his computer crashes leaving him with only one printed out copy. I've had the experience of losing valuable files when the hard drive I'm writing this review crashed so I know exactly where he was coming from. Topping that off he loses that copy to Joe Pesci who's made himself a makeshift shelter in the boiler room of the Harvard library. Fraser finds Pesci throwing his thesis page by page into the boiler for some heat. Pesci's got him by the short hairs and they make an incredible bargain. He'll give Fraser back his thesis page by page for favors done. Incredibly he accepts the deal.More incredibly the two of them form a unique bond and Pesci goes to live with Fraser and his roommates Moira Kelly Patrick Dempsey and Josh Hamilton. Of the group of them I really enjoyed Hamilton's portrayal of the uptight premed student.The four Harvard kids learn a whole lot about life and what's really important in it. And I think they all will graduate life with honors.This review is respectfully dedicated to David T. Frank who checked out of life way too soon.

You can really FEEL the portrayal of the characters from Pesci and Fraser but adding Patrick Dempsey Moira Kelly and Josh Hamilton completes the group. It is truly a beautiful film.";

She plays an important grounding role. Patrick Dempsey I never saw him much but this role was played perfectly. He plays the the kind very sensitives guy that does not take to much things seriously. And Josh Halmilton even though you probably wont like him at first he supports one feeling of wrongness trough the movie by not getting involved fitting ones beliefs because thats Wat he was thought and breaks down slowly trough the movie. Enjoy. This is the kind of movie you watch when you are down or that it is raining. It kind of makes things a little easier. Also see Dead poets society.".

At the time however I had recently watched With Honors for about the 20th time and I chose it for my answer. Researching the movie on this website I was astounded when I discovered that it did not win well it wasn't even nominated for any award on screen writing or acting. It was only nominated for Best Original Song I'll Remember performed by Madonna.The film centers on Montgomery 'Monty' Kessler Brendan Fraser a government senior student at Harvard University who thinks his life depends on his thesis. When his computer crashes Monty decides that the reasonable thing to do is to rush to make copies of the only hard copy of the thesis he has. But on the way to the copy shop he has an accident and the thesis falls into the boiler room of the library and into the hands of Simon Wilder Joe Pesci a homeless man who has made a makeshift home in there. At first there is tension between the two as Monty is outraged for the deal he is forced to make with Simon for each day of food and shelter Monty gets one page of the thesis. As time goes by Monty realizes that there is more to Simon than meets the eye. The relationship between Monty and Simon develops into a strong friendship and Monty soon learns that there is more to life than graduating with honors.I am always moved by the beautiful story and the incredible acting in this film. The performances are so honest that the story seems to have been taken out of real life. The transition in the character of Monty from a young man that considers grades and recognition to be the most important things in the world to a man touched by the life of a bum  as Simon refers to himself  who is intelligent and goodnatured and knows the meaning of love.The last few lines in the movie always bring tears to my eyes as Monty reads Simon's selfwritten obituary He is survived by his family Jeff Hawks who always remembers to flush Everett Calloway who knows how to use words Courtney Blumenthal who is strong and also knows how to love and by Montgomery Kessler who will graduate life with honor and without regret.".

I believe that Pesci played an excellent role and it made me suprised how he could play a kind funny and tearjearking role after parts in casino and other gangster films. I also believe that Fraser played an excellent role to as the quite passive Harvard pupil Montgomery Kessler. He played an exceptional duo with Pesci and I hope to see more films like this as it really brought new light to my eyes of films.";

Monty in exasperation reevaluates his priorities and the thesis itself as he realizes that selfishness and being cold makes him that less human and honorable. At the possible brink of Pesci's character's death Monty does a full 180 degree turn. Additionally he then changes his thesis to the disdain of Gore Vidal.This movie is a must see for all that study vote or even think about government and its role in society. Our growing homeless situation in the States and abroad is a reminder that we do need each other to some degree.An excellent movie by Keshishian who was also a Harvard graduate. The song by Madonna is moving and an excellent accompaniment to this stellar movie. Not to mention a step up for Moira Kelley who had previously done that ridiculous skating movie and then went to do a sting on One Tree Hill.".

Wilder's extraction of favors from Kessler as the price for returning pages is the film's McGuffin.As a plot device this is admittedly strained but so's that of Groundhog Day another film in which the protagonist learns that there's more to life than being a selfabsorbed jackass. While Kessler's character is not as sorely in need of a makeover as Bill Murray's Phil Connors the experience of satisfying Wilder's demands then caring for and finally caring about him transforms Kessler as well as his three housemates played by Kelly Dempsey and Hamilton.Several of the negative railings of the film on this site seem to be by conservatives offended by Kessler's abandonment of a Hobbesian world view in favor of an embrace of humanity warts and all. Certainly the film is somewhat preachy and a bit clichd yet it is hardly hackneyed. Pesci's Wilder is a standin for the lifeembracing American archetype immortalized in Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass quotations from which arise seamlessly in the plot.Fraser's portrayal of Kessler is sincere and unaffected less broad and superficial than his better known work in films such as Bedazzled and The Mummy. Kelly Dempsey and Hamilton like Fraser in their twenties at the time each capture something essential and vulnerable in the college students they portray.

	schema:reviewBody "Romy Schneider 19381982 one of those actresses about whom you can still say She was a true artist constantly makes us think of her various roles that she played with genuine passion. Perhaps what comes to our mind first are the most famous roles from both her German and French career. Here however we see Romy in a remake movie built upon a love story so touching so universal where two lovers swear each other endless love and keep their promise. At the same time CHRISTINE by Pierre Gaspard Huit is a historic movie for Romy herself because it was here she met the love of her life  Alain Delon. But let me skip all of the background information now including the remake nature of the film and focus purely on the movie itself. 50 years have passed since its premiere and a typical question arises Is CHRISTINE still a movie that you will at least consider watchable? Let me make myself clear CHRISTINE is nothing of a thought provoking film no sort of ambitious content no masterwork whatsoever. If you await something educational intellectual or entertaining this one will rather disappoint you. CHRISTINE's strong point I think is the beauty and emotions it conveys. It is not only the story that reminds many people of classic love dramas some even overrated it as a German version of ROMEO AND JULIET but the way the story is executed. It's a very romantic picture filled with moments of affection nostalgia subtleness and mystery. The action takes place in Vienna in 1906 at the very twilight of the Habsburgian reign. However that historical aspect constitutes a significant background for all the rest. The cameraman very well managed to combine this picture with the focus of our attention the couple Christine Romy Schneider and Fritz Alain Delon. Such images remained in my memory as the opera in the theater where the emperor Franz Joseph takes part little charming cafs that the couple visit sweet balls of aristocracy and an outdoor picnic. What a peaceful life in the monarchy which is of course partly illusive!There are some lovely scenes in the movie that we should not ignore. First of all it is Fritz's visit to Christine's house and his meeting with her father a musician. The moment they talk about music is interrupted by the picture of Christine singing Ave Maria on rehearsals. Besides a significant moment is their voyage which gives us an insight into a very nice mood. Another beautiful moment is the echo I love you. The final closeup on Christine's face appears to be a very memorable moment of the whole movie. I am aware that you may find this sweet and unnatural  such a chocolate with sugar like WENN DER WEISSE FLIEDER MONPTI MAEDCHENJAHRE EINER KOENIGIN etc. Yet it all directs our thinking towards something positive. That is in my opinion what makes these movies pleasant to watch.However I don't think that I have already encouraged many movie buffs to watch CHRISTINE. In fact a lot of modern people do not like sentimentality tragic stories of love with duels and vows. Yet I insist saying that you should see it. It's due to one more aspect performances! In such love stories the most important focus is the couple if they are genuine in their performances if viewers do not notice anything fake. Romy Schneider and Alain Delon perfectly meet these requirements! Schneider's buffs will find her performance exceptional. Others will find it marvelous. It seems clear that she was feeling very comfortable at Alain Delon's side. There is a chemistry between them and they both do very good jobs. The supporting cast are of course in the shadow but it does not lower anything.A nice film far from masterpiece yet very worth watching as a sentimental nice movie about gentle love. Yes after all this half century there is still something valuable to discover. It is a pity that CHRISTINE has not become an important part of Romy's filmography because it is clearly SchneiderDelon's moment in the history of cinema. 710".

Such images remained in my memory as the opera in the theater where the emperor Franz Joseph takes part little charming cafs that the couple visit sweet balls of aristocracy and an outdoor picnic. What a peaceful life in the monarchy which is of course partly illusive!There are some lovely scenes in the movie that we should not ignore. First of all it is Fritz's visit to Christine's house and his meeting with her father a musician. The moment they talk about music is interrupted by the picture of Christine singing Ave Maria on rehearsals. Besides a significant moment is their voyage which gives us an insight into a very nice mood. Another beautiful moment is the echo I love you. The final closeup on Christine's face appears to be a very memorable moment of the whole movie. I am aware that you may find this sweet and unnatural  such a chocolate with sugar like WENN DER WEISSE FLIEDER MONPTI MAEDCHENJAHRE EINER KOENIGIN etc. Yet it all directs our thinking towards something positive. That is in my opinion what makes these movies pleasant to watch.However I don't think that I have already encouraged many movie buffs to watch CHRISTINE. In fact a lot of modern people do not like sentimentality tragic stories of love with duels and vows. Yet I insist saying that you should see it. It's due to one more aspect performances! In such love stories the most important focus is the couple if they are genuine in their performances if viewers do not notice anything fake. Romy Schneider and Alain Delon perfectly meet these requirements! Schneider's buffs will find her performance exceptional. Others will find it marvelous. It seems clear that she was feeling very comfortable at Alain Delon's side. There is a chemistry between them and they both do very good jobs. The supporting cast are of course in the shadow but it does not lower anything.A nice film far from masterpiece yet very worth watching as a sentimental nice movie about gentle love. Yes after all this half century there is still something valuable to discover. It is a pity that CHRISTINE has not become an important part of Romy's filmography because it is clearly SchneiderDelon's moment in the history of cinema. 710";

	schema:reviewBody "Good looking Delon and Romy Schneider were without any doubt a nice couple in several films but this one seems to be the most romantic one for both. In fact it looks like a modified version of famous novel Romeo and Juliet. Christine Schneider felt in love with young officer Franz Lobheiner Delon who at the same time had relationship with a noble old man's wife. The latter did not want anything else than to have love with Lobheiner who was much younger than her and her husband but Lobheiner also felt in love with Christine and at the time he was finishing his relations with the rich old woman Baronne Lena Eggersdorf he was discovered by Mr. Eggersdorf who asked him to accept a fatal duel where Lobheiner was killed. This was too much for Christine who knew little or nothing of the former relationship between Lobheiner and Mrs. Eggersdorf and she finally decided to kill herself in order to meet her loving Franz. It is a modest film with quite simple plot but nice to see it. The film shows several sites of Vienna and of the Austrian high society of early 20th century.".

And I decided why not? For me the movie was 15 well spent.Mickey Rourke plays John Sedley a smalltime hood whose deformation has given him the nickname Johnny Handsome who is in the midst of planning a robbery with his friend Mikey Chalmette Played by Scott Wilson and 2 other criminals Rafe and Sunny Played by the always great Lance Henriksen and Ellen Barkin. In the middle of the robbery John and Mikey are doublecrossed by Sunny and Rafe. Mikey ends up killed and Johnny is arrested. While in jail Lt.

At the hospital the sympathetic Dr. Steven Fisher Played by Forest Whitaker gives Johnny a new face a new identity Johnny is given the name Johnny Mitchell and a new shot at life. Johnny is eventually granted parole and gets a job at a plant. Going straight isn't all that easy however. What Johnny really intends to do is get even with Rafe and Sunny.I found the film to be an intense and underrated revenge noir that really deserves more attention than it already has. The score by Ry Cooder Also responsible for the equally good score for Trespass fits the film well too. The only thing that I did not like about the film was the ending which was pretty sad. Nevertheless it's a fun film that will hopefully get more recognition in the future.Highly recommended.DVD Extras The movie is presented in a crisp 1.333 full frame format although I really don't know why Artisan decided against showing the film in it's original 1.85 aspect ratio but it's still a good presentation. It's also VHS sourced as if you watch the film all the way to the end you'll see the I.V.E. logo.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is rare that a movie with a premise as farfetched as Johnny Handsome could wind up being so memorable. It helps when a top notch action director is assisted by an outstanding ensemble cast firing on all cylinders to make this story believable.Johnny Handsome hit theaters in the fall of '89. It bombed largely due to a weak promotional campaign by TriStar pictures. 19 years later it is still unavailable on DVD. The excellent cast includes Ellen Barkin Scott Wilson and future Oscar winners Morgan Freeman and Forrest Whittaker. However it is Mickey Rourke in the title role and Lance Henriksen as his archnemesis who truly hit grand slams with their performances. The heartbreaking original score by Ry Cooder and the rich atmosphere of the New Orleans setting also elevate this material considerably. This is not your typical revenge action picture.The movie can best be described as a gritty noirish crime drama with a scifi twist that maintains plausibility instead of running off the rails into comedic territory as with 1997's FaceOff. The film moves at a brisk pace which is fine but this fact ultimately winds up being the only flaw with Johnny Handsome. One almost gets the impression more was filmed but the studio demanded a 90 minute cut. A Special Edition director's cut DVD is warranted. A longer run time allowing for more scenes to flesh out the characters portrayed by the great supporting cast would have made this already outstanding film a true classic.It would really be nice to see Walter Hill direct another action film one of these days. Hill and Peckinpah were the real deals. Other filmmakers such as John Woo strive to match the perfection of these two but have yet to achieve it.".

With a new face making him unrecognisable there is scope to enact revenge on the two people who killed his best friend and had him put in prison...Walter Hill knows his film noir anyone who has seen The Driver knows this. Here for Johnny Handsome Hill takes a lot of the fantastical elements of noir and dresses it up admirably as a violent revenge thriller. A box office flop and something of a kicking post for big hitting critics of the late 1980s it's a film that now can be seen as being very much in tune with its influences.The charges of it being too bonkers too violent and too much of a B movie homage just don't add up because what is on offer is good solid meaty neonoir cinema. A protagonist with an affliction medical shenanigans hyper femme fatale over the top villain and a stoic and sarcastic gumshoe type copper. All of which operate in a sweaty and luridly coloured New Orleans. Add in Hill's eye for aggressive action sequences and it's neo a gogo.Hill gets strong performances from his cast ensuring emotional bonds are not over egged and a clamour for sympathy and understanding kept to a bearable level by the actors playing the good guys n dolls. While giving Henriksen and Barkin licence to sizzle with sinister glee is astute and perfectly in tune with the material on the page. Leonetti's photography has the requisite pulpy noirishness to it and the familiar twangs of Ry Cooder are never a bad thing in a Walter Hill movie.It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but those complaining about missed opportunities regarding rehabilitation  or that the liberal doctor turns out to be clinically wrong in his reform beliefs  really are missing the point or unaware of the world where something like Johnny Handsome lives. From the kinetic misery at film's start to the ever so in tune with film noir finale Johnny Handsome is well worth a look by anyone interested in noir's updated version. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Well renowned action director Walter Hill tackles a more moody character driven crime drama in the shape of Johnny Handsome and it would have to be one of his undertheradar productions. The story follows that of a deformed criminal John who stages a heist however there's a doublecross which sees his best friend killed and him going to prison. There he is asked to take part in a rehabilitation program where they clear him of his deformity while also getting him parole. Hoping now that he can start a new life however John is still burning inside for vengeance. Presenting an ideal cast Hill really does cast a spell over his audience with solid even if it does feel a bit underdone storytelling backed up by credibly good performances from leading man Mickey Rourke within the peak of his career and equally so support by Morgan Freeman Ellen Barkin Lance Henrikson Elizabeth McGovern and Forest Whitaker. Everybody chips in adding their own stamp to proceedings and establishing gripping character rapports or confrontations e.g. between Freeman's detective and Whitaker's doctor.Hill's cruiselike direction is crisp and tidy engineering some intense passages and some welloiled edgy action setpieces although they are lowkey still violent but this really does belong to its cast and the interestingly smart story that was adapted off John Godey's novel The Three Worlds of Johnny Handsome. The ambitious plot does have a lot going on and it might not all come together but how it does play out stays constantly interesting and rather unpleasant in its details. Rourke's character Johnny is given a chance to start over and go straight from this physical change brings much needed confidence but the hunger inside for revenge can't simply be cured or forgotten. Someone he cared for who saw beyond his deformity deserved payback. Johnny would deliver it. So he carefully plans out the revenge wanting to tease before actually ending it and things get even more suspenseful when the situation starts to go off the rails. Lance Henrikson and Ellen Barkin really do nail down their explosively sly parts of the two crooks who betrayed Johnny. The everreliable Hill regular Ry Cooder adds a smoking touch to the music score.One of those films I didn't know all that much of but came away pleasantly surprised.".

Nothing original there I'll admit.

Not only does Rourke affect asevere speech impediment as the disfigured Johnny Handsomebut he then takes on a new one as a man who is now capable ofproper diction but who is completely unused to being able tospeak properly.  And he is constant in his portrayal throughout.The story is simple but good driven with excellent visual editingand a wonderful sound track provided by Ry Cooder that reallysets the pacing.  The cast is largely wonderful as well with quite afew recognizable stars.  Forest Whitaker as the sympathetic butdriven and demanding doctor Lance Henrikson and Ellen Barkinin amazing performances as two completely greedy scumbagsand Morgan Freeman in a real role reversal as a rotten tauntingparole officer.  Probably the only weak link in the cast is ElizabethMcGovern who's attempted Louisiana accent never holds up andoverall acting just suffices.This film remains a favorite of mine that I watch every now andagain always enjoying it both for the excitingly building tension ofthe story and the great performances and performers litteredthroughout the film.  If you like this film I also suggest TheElephant Man by David Lynch for the lifewithdisfigurementaspects or The Warriors by Walter Hill as a great earlyexample of this same director's work.810  Mickey Rourke at his best!".

There are plot holes agogo and the whole thing falls apart a bit in the last twenty minutes or so  the ending is especially disappointing. But come on it's better than 5.6 with good performances from Rourke Forest Whitaker and a turn of twinkly eyed cynicism from Morgan Freeman who effortlessly steals every scene he appears in. And let's not forget a deliciously over the top effort from Ellen Barkin as the baddest girl ever to walk the earth.It isn't Shakespeare but it's directed in typically robust style by Walter Hill and to my surprise I found myself caring about Johnny and hoping it all worked out for him. I won't say whether it does or not because it's worth seeing this one to find out for yourself. Just get a big bucket of popcorn and don't think too much and you'll have a great time.".

When his friend is killed and he is doublecrossed by some accomplices on a job he ends up in prison but his case is taken up by a pioneering surgeon researching the link between physical disabilities and criminal recidivism. If he can give Johnny a new face can Johnny turn his life around ?I have a very soft spot for this movie although I must admit its story line is unremittingly bleak and its world view is harshly cynical. If you're looking for a cheery date movie its cocktail of violence suffering and nihilism is perhaps not for you. But if you're prepared to go with it it's a great story full of rich characters terrific performances and a highly original theme  to what extent are criminal tendencies part of our personalities and is it futile to try to overcome them ? I'm especially drawn to the Drones character brilliantly played by Freeman for whom life contains no surprises and people behave in an entirely predictable way. In one sense he's loathsome constantly hounding and belittling anyone's attempt to better themselves but in another he's a worldweary but compassionate realist whose eloquent final epitaph for Johnny is as touching and heartfelt as any ever written. All of the characters are imbued with passion be it Donna's dignity Sunny's scheming Dr Fisher's philanthropy or Rafe's constantly simmering fury and the entire ensemble are all fearless and terrific right down to the minor players. The sultry New Orleans setting and drunken blues guitar score by Ry Cooder combine to create a potboiler atmosphere of decadence and tension of lives lived at a flashpoint and corruption lurking around every darkened street corner. It also utilises a very interesting camera style whereby the actors are often talking and looking direct to camera for long beats monologues rather than overtheshoulder dialogue. This stuff is literally inyourface and intensifies all the big speeches  director of photography Matthew F. Leonetti also counterpoints it with silent reaction shots so that the movie is deliciously slow and dreamy as it winds towards its sad but satisfying conclusion. All of these elements are beautifully woven together by Hill into a brilliant  if minor  crime picture which is both thoughtprovoking and deeply affecting. Extremely well written by Ken Friedman based on the book The Three Worlds Of Johnny Handsome by John Godey who also wrote The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three. If you are ever prone to thinking Morgan Freeman is overrated or in too many movies give yourself a stern talking to and then watch this film. All of the cast are very good but he is mesmerisingly brilliant  every nuance every look every pause every gesture counts towards the drama and contradiction of his complicated character and to the rich enjoyment of the movie. He's a truly great actor. 710".

It also utilises a very interesting camera style whereby the actors are often talking and looking direct to camera for long beats monologues rather than overtheshoulder dialogue. This stuff is literally inyourface and intensifies all the big speeches  director of photography Matthew F. Leonetti also counterpoints it with silent reaction shots so that the movie is deliciously slow and dreamy as it winds towards its sad but satisfying conclusion. All of these elements are beautifully woven together by Hill into a brilliant  if minor  crime picture which is both thoughtprovoking and deeply affecting. Extremely well written by Ken Friedman based on the book The Three Worlds Of Johnny Handsome by John Godey who also wrote The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three. If you are ever prone to thinking Morgan Freeman is overrated or in too many movies give yourself a stern talking to and then watch this film. All of the cast are very good but he is mesmerisingly brilliant  every nuance every look every pause every gesture counts towards the drama and contradiction of his complicated character and to the rich enjoyment of the movie. He's a truly great actor. 710";

	schema:headline " An enjoyable Mickey Rourke vehicle.";
	schema:reviewBody "Decent highly watchable pulp crime fiction from Walter Hill based upon the novel The Three Worlds of Johnny Handsome by John Godey and scripted by Ken Friedman. It's much too predictable in terms of the story developments so it misses its chance for greatness but thanks to an excellent cast typically efficient direction from Hill and a seedy ambiance it still works pretty well. Mickey Rourke does nicely as the title character a small time criminal with a deformed face who's had a pretty hard knock life. He participates in a heist to assist father figure Mikey Chalmette Scott Wilson but their partners in crime Rafe Garrett Lance Henriksen and Sunny Boyd Ellen Barkin double cross them leading to Mikey's death and Johnny's arrest. While in prison Johnny is approached by a well intentioned young doctor Steven Resher Forest Whitaker who proposes performing plastic surgery on Johnny's features to assist him in attempting a new life. Of course what the cynical police detective A.Z. Drones Morgan Freeman believes is what we all know to expect once a lowlife ALWAYS a lowlife and even while working a legitimate job Johnny plans vengeance. The violence is as is standard for Hill's work quite stylish and brutal. The makeup on Rourke courtesy of Michael Westmore and Zoltan Elek is impressive. Ry Cooder's flavourful music is as always a treat to listen to. Rourke is capably supported by Henriksen and Barkin who are a colourful pair of utterly trashy despicable villains her pronunciation of the word geek is indeed priceless. Freeman is a hoot as the cop and the too briefly seen Wilson is wonderful. Elizabeth McGovern is appealing enough as the obligatory love interest. Also appearing are David Schramm 'Wings' as crooked lawyer Vic Dumask Hill repertory player Peter Jason as shipyard boss Mr. Bonet J.W. Smith as criminal accomplice Larry Jeffrey Meek as thieving shipyard employee Earl and prominent comedian  character actor Blake Clark in a bit part as a sheriff. The story may be mostly standard fare but it's still well told and the movie is solidly entertaining right up to its inevitable conclusion. Seven out of 10.".

	schema:headline " A badly deformed criminal is rehabilitated undergoing reconstructive surgery only to use his new identity to plot revenge!";
	schema:reviewBody "Many reviews to date regarding the 1989 film 'Johnny Handsome' claimed that the Walter Hill crime thriller was a slow moving poorly aimed feature. Since I gave the film a chance I came to the conclusion that those critics probably watched the opening half hour before skipping off to the salon with their BFF's to get their back crack and sack waxed and flap wrists over watercress soup and Madonna music videos. I'm guessing that was late '80's Hollywood anyway I don't really want to know the specifics... I found it thoroughly enjoyable 'Johnny Handsome' that was very influential intertextual references made by great modern directors such as John Woo with the likes of 'Hard Target' have nodded in Handsome's direction and in regard to issues still proving highly debatable today contained within the film it remains far ahead of its time.'Johnny Handsome' is the story of the downtrodden and tragic John Sedley played with humility and stark realism by Mickey Rourke. Left to fend for himself since the age of 13 after his prostitute mother died and having been born with a great genetic deformity that has rendered his face as badly deformed as that of the Elephant Man he is a joke he's unwanted unloved and therefore has turned to crime to survive. He cannot talk properly due to the absence of a formal education and also as a result of a hare lip.Sedley is asked by his closest friend Mikey Chalmette played humbly and earnestly by Scott Wilson out of desperation to help him set up a heist in their hometown of New Orleans. Doublecrossed and left for dead Sedley is the victim of an attempted murder in prison which sets him on the road to redemption when a doctor offers a trial of radical reconstructive surgery to cure his genetic deformity as he enters the witness protection program. But smiling darkly on the edge of every scene is Police Lieutenant A.Z. Drones played softly yet sinisterly by a freshfaced Morgan Freeman a man who continually claims that the seemingly fragile and longdamaged Sedley is a born criminal who will offend again regardless of the efforts of his redeemers to help him become a part of the civilised world.So when Sedley undergoes his miraculous transformation is given a voice to speak with and learns to exercise his past demons he takes an honest job. But with Drones on his back like the ghost of his conscience it isn't long before he is contemplating using his new identity to draw the doublecrossing heist partners who put him in prison and now believe he is dead into a revenge plot playing them off against each other in the process.Johnny Handsome boasts one of the finest lists of actors dedicated to what is essentially a small scale but very well written crime drama. It plays off a single strand narrative but allows all its key characters to play openly and occasionally run riot as they tend to in all Walter Hill films. Everyone has a story and if not they come with clever pieces of worldly wisdom seldom found in movie characters. Morgan Freeman for one being world renowned for playing such characters.But also with a supporting cast including Forest Whittaker Lance Henriksen and Ellen Barkin you're treated to the finest drama you could expect from an '80's crime thriller that particular decade not exactly known for its drama over absent minded action films and comedies.New Orleans itself plays a fine character in the film breathing colour into its scenes. From the docks the narrow streets and the colourful nightclubs of the French Quarter and the unmistakeably distinctive graveyards right down to the architecture within the apartments and houses the city gives this film an undeniable sense of place that few others could have provided. This is also a regular feature of Hill's older films such as The Driver The Warriors 48 Hours and Southern Comfort. Hill is as much an artist painting a picture as he is a director of unique acting talent.But Sedley's affliction is the main theme of the film something that not only draws out the worst in the worst people but often the worst of the best. It's difficult to tell whether Lt. A.Z. Drones is either a good man or a villain because he believes that Sedley's new face is just a mask hiding the ugly truth of who he used to be and who he will always be deep down. Throughout the film and towards the end Sedley comes to believe that this is true and that he might actually be redeemed simply by coming to accept it but much of the story is about the conflicting emotions of a man being torn in both directions by good and bad influences weakened by a lifetime of torment and neglect. In many respects it's a moral tale which is surprising but in a good way.Maybe 'Johnny Handsome' was too honest thoughtful and too unconventionally cool for critics expecting yet another Walter Hill allmale shoot em up after he gave the world 'Extreme Prejudice' and 'Red Heat' but maybe it was Hill's decision to wear his grizzled heart on his sleeve to allow his main character to fall in love and to want forgiveness that let down his 98 male audience. After all he hasn't made such a statement since yet 'Johnny Handsome' is possibly the most mature piece of work in Hill's back catalogue and although it didn't work so well in 1989 I feel it's more relevant now than it may ever be in a vain world obsessed with looks yet one that is set off balance by a sympathetic minority that understands the ugliness of this world represents the reality so frequently avoided!".

	schema:headline " A LevelHeaded Gaze at the Natural Progression of a Character";
	schema:reviewBody "Johnny Handsome emerges from the film noir envelope of the 1940s out of movies with bleak streets and bitter laughter with characters who dwell in sourpuss crash pads and regard bars as their personal salons. It is set in New Orleans a city with a film noir essence and it stars Mickey Rourke who siphons himself into the role of a burntout downandouter who has as good as withdrawn himself. The only real friend he has is a father figure named Mikey who brings Johnny in on a jewelry store job with a couple of really shady characters. They call him Johnny Handsome since his face has been miserably deformed since birth. He and John Merrick look closely related. Johnny has also trained himself to talk despite some sort of nasal or vocal obstruction by his disfigurement resulting in a rhinal phonetic mutter. As the movie opens he and Mikey have been doublecrossed resulting in Mikey dead Johnny the patsy the haul in the hands of their despicable associates.In jail he's accorded a deal if he'll single out his coconspirators. He declines because it is of course gangland decree that you do not rat on your partners and of course also because he intends to kill them when he gets back on the street. But then an intriguing thing happens to him In jail a caring surgeon recommends that plastic surgery could turn Johnny into a fairly attractive guy and speech therapy could make him into an adequate contender for rehabilitation. Johnny is such a miserable and achingly sad character in such a bleak world that we are overjoyed by this ray of sunlight.Johnny has nothing to lose and subjects himself to the surgery which faithful to the customs of movies like this is no problem at all. Out on parole he walks the straight and narrow. And he happens on a girl who loves him. However Johnny has an inner dilemma Since the day he was born he's been walking around feeling repulsive fearful rejected that he has a hard time grasping any real fortune. In fact the choice is clear all along He can go straight mind his p's and q's and be content with this woman. Or he can resume with crime and see his vengeance through. As a man who's spent his entire life made to feel like a waste and a goodfornothing he has a choice between something that at this point he finds difficult and something that comes very very easily. As per Rourke's usual he adopts a challenging physical transformation that complements his emotional one.Made during the late '80s '90s stretch of typically unintelligent action pictures with audiences less enterprising in a way than those of the 1940s and stars who like to maintain their hero worship or avoid any threat to their masculinity at the end there is the expectation that Johnny will choose the path of improvement and hopefulness not without some difficulty naturally but he is endowed with every emotional practical and legal clean break to be able to do that. Nevertheless the charm of this film especially as an American action movie from 1989 is that it takes a levelheaded gaze at the natural progression of its character. If you've been jeered into the shadows all your life no matter how much light you suddenly get where would you feel most at home? And what is happiness? Satisfaction peace of mind. If you were him what would really truly give you those things? This old film noir wine poured into a gritty hazy new bottle is filmed with genuine flair. Matthew F. Leonetti the cinematographer smokes out the scrappiest alienation in the most sordid sections of New Orleans and the Ry Cooder music is a merge with the blues and a weep. It is strange how Walter Hill's intensely dark and violent dramatic thriller is given little to no reference literature hardly anyone has heard of it is all in all a buried treasure. Not that many movies have the utter nostalgia ruefulness and grit that this movie evokes throughout.And the movie is definitely enhanced by tenacious supporting performances by a remarkably notable cast including Ellen Barkin playing one rotten apple riding roughshod over any and everything that even comes close to boring her Morgan Freeman in a rare role as a mean cold man a lonewolf cop just waiting for Johnny to slip up Lance Henriksen on the other hand breaking out of all those stoic roles to eat up the scenery as a formidably wicked character of almost comicbook proportions and Forest Whitaker that urgent ray of sunlight in Johnny's life that one presence who is highly educated and highly compassionate and ennobled by his profession. And though he's largely identified with the action genres of postclassical American cinema Hill directs with an almost maligning disinterest in Reaganera Hollywood formality. This is a movie in the real practice of film noir a movie where heroism is simply being able to survive where an everyday person treats himself to the darker proclivities of his character and destiny arrives.".

	onyx:emotionText "Johnny Handsome emerges from the film noir envelope of the 1940s out of movies with bleak streets and bitter laughter with characters who dwell in sourpuss crash pads and regard bars as their personal salons. It is set in New Orleans a city with a film noir essence and it stars Mickey Rourke who siphons himself into the role of a burntout downandouter who has as good as withdrawn himself. The only real friend he has is a father figure named Mikey who brings Johnny in on a jewelry store job with a couple of really shady characters. They call him Johnny Handsome since his face has been miserably deformed since birth. He and John Merrick look closely related. Johnny has also trained himself to talk despite some sort of nasal or vocal obstruction by his disfigurement resulting in a rhinal phonetic mutter. As the movie opens he and Mikey have been doublecrossed resulting in Mikey dead Johnny the patsy the haul in the hands of their despicable associates.In jail he's accorded a deal if he'll single out his coconspirators. He declines because it is of course gangland decree that you do not rat on your partners and of course also because he intends to kill them when he gets back on the street. But then an intriguing thing happens to him In jail a caring surgeon recommends that plastic surgery could turn Johnny into a fairly attractive guy and speech therapy could make him into an adequate contender for rehabilitation. Johnny is such a miserable and achingly sad character in such a bleak world that we are overjoyed by this ray of sunlight.Johnny has nothing to lose and subjects himself to the surgery which faithful to the customs of movies like this is no problem at all. Out on parole he walks the straight and narrow. And he happens on a girl who loves him. However Johnny has an inner dilemma Since the day he was born he's been walking around feeling repulsive fearful rejected that he has a hard time grasping any real fortune. In fact the choice is clear all along He can go straight mind his p's and q's and be content with this woman. Or he can resume with crime and see his vengeance through. As a man who's spent his entire life made to feel like a waste and a goodfornothing he has a choice between something that at this point he finds difficult and something that comes very very easily. As per Rourke's usual he adopts a challenging physical transformation that complements his emotional one.Made during the late '80s '90s stretch of typically unintelligent action pictures with audiences less enterprising in a way than those of the 1940s and stars who like to maintain their hero worship or avoid any threat to their masculinity at the end there is the expectation that Johnny will choose the path of improvement and hopefulness not without some difficulty naturally but he is endowed with every emotional practical and legal clean break to be able to do that. Nevertheless the charm of this film especially as an American action movie from 1989 is that it takes a levelheaded gaze at the natural progression of its character. If you've been jeered into the shadows all your life no matter how much light you suddenly get where would you feel most at home? And what is happiness? Satisfaction peace of mind. If you were him what would really truly give you those things? This old film noir wine poured into a gritty hazy new bottle is filmed with genuine flair. Matthew F. Leonetti the cinematographer smokes out the scrappiest alienation in the most sordid sections of New Orleans and the Ry Cooder music is a merge with the blues and a weep. It is strange how Walter Hill's intensely dark and violent dramatic thriller is given little to no reference literature hardly anyone has heard of it is all in all a buried treasure. Not that many movies have the utter nostalgia ruefulness and grit that this movie evokes throughout.And the movie is definitely enhanced by tenacious supporting performances by a remarkably notable cast including Ellen Barkin playing one rotten apple riding roughshod over any and everything that even comes close to boring her Morgan Freeman in a rare role as a mean cold man a lonewolf cop just waiting for Johnny to slip up Lance Henriksen on the other hand breaking out of all those stoic roles to eat up the scenery as a formidably wicked character of almost comicbook proportions and Forest Whitaker that urgent ray of sunlight in Johnny's life that one presence who is highly educated and highly compassionate and ennobled by his profession.

When the robbery goes wrongMikey is killed by Rafe and Johnny is setup by Sunny and Rafe to take the fall and gets put in prison and is stabbed while he's inside prison. While Johnny is in the hospital and in a comaa sympathetic surgeon named Dr. Steven FisherForrest Whitakeroffers Johnny a reconstructive surgery on his face and a new life. Although Johnny has a new face and nameJohnny still wants to get revenge on Sunny and Rafe at all costs new face or not.Johnny Handsome is an excellent film that is true to the genre and spirit of Film Noirit's darkgritty and ugly and the film works so well not just as Crime DramaFilm Noir or Thrillerbut also as a great character study. Walter Hill definitely knows the Film Noir genre having done another Film Noir in 1978 with his classic The Driver. What I love about the film is that Hill creates a world of a dark world not at all related to the 80s but to the 40swhere in this film and in the works of Dashell Hammett and Raymond Chandler some of the characters are goodbad or something else in between. Where in the 80s most films were bright and colorfulJohnny Handsome is grim and gritty and doesn't fit in with the colorful world of the 80s where all characters are good and everything is going to turnout all right and I think that is one of the reasons that Johnny Handsome is underrated because right from the opening credits it's established that Johnny Handsome is not a lighthearted film but a film that is going to be bleak and dark until the very end. Johnny Handsome is a film that could have easily been made in the 40s. What I also love about Johnny Handsome is that it's a great character study. The main character John Sedley is a tragic character in many respectsbecause even though John has had surgery on his face and has a new nameJohn still feels like he has his old face and has the same emotions he had before. John also has to go out into the world with his new face try to deal with his past and present. The past where Dr.Fisher gives John a new face and a new life and feels that he will turnout o.k or having to deal with local cop L.T A.Z.DronesMorgan Freemanwho despite seeing Johnny's new face doesn't believe that John will neverever change and will always be a criminal. Another thing from his past is Sunny and Rafe and how John still carries the emotional scars from dealing with those two and trying to get revenge. In the presentJohnny doesn't want his new girlfriend and lover DonnaElizabeth McGovernto know about his past or who he used to bebut unfortunately for Johnny his past and present meet up. I think that one of the themes of the film is that you can change how a person looks on the outside butyou can't change how they feel on the inside Some probably would see Hill's films as just Action filmsbut the characters in his films have depth and history and it's one of the many reasons Walter Hill is one of my favorite film directors. Johnny Handsome is not only a great Film Noir but also a great character study of John Sedley. Although not as Actionpacked as many of Hill's filmsJohnny Handsome has a few wellexecuted Action scenes that will get the viewer riled up which are violent and fast and at times brutal which greatly matches the film's dark and gritty tone. With the exception of a couple films Hill has never been known for making long films and if their is a flaw with this film is that it's not long enough in my opinion and should have been 1520 minutes longer and had more scenes with the characters because I wanted to see much morebut that doesn't stop the film from being great and memorable. The ending of this film is brilliantpowerfulbleak and sad but is true to the dark and grim spirit of Film Noir. An excellent and unforgettable conclusion.The whole cast does a great job. Mickey Rourke is excellent and at his best as John Sedleybringing depthtoughness and sadness to the role. One of Rourke's most underrated performances. Ellen Barkin is fantasticover the top and sexy as Sunny a sexybut slimy woman. Elizabeth McGovern does a great job as DonnaJohnny's new girlfriend. Lance Henriksen is menacing and believable as RafeSunny's partner in crime. Morgan Freeman is great as always as cop L.T. A.Z.Drones a cop who's always on Johnny's case. Forest Whitaker is wonderful as Dr.Fisher a sympathetic doctor who tries to help and understand Johnny. Scott Glenn does a fine job in his small role as MikeyJohn's friend and older brothertype.Walter Hill's direction is excellentbringing a darkgrittysomber look to the film and also does well with the Action scenes.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a minor Walter Hill film partly redeemed by a couple of strong performances and an excellent score. Mickey Rourke whose last good film perhaps this is plays John Sedley Johnny Handsome' and labours for the first part of the film under make up presumably inspired by the Elephant Man  as well as a handicapping mumble recalling the actor's idol Marlon Brando. Hill one time Peckinpah protg has seen better days with such films as The Warriors 48 Hours Streets of Fire etc and here struggles to make a rather bald plot dynamic. Essentially it's a tale of crime gone wrong betrayal brooding and then final revenge enlivened with rather peremptory love interest. The surgery side of the story in which Sedley is miraculously remade into handsome Mickey Rourke is no more than a detour from an underworld tale we've all seen before. Hill characteristically provides memorable opening sequences for his films. This strength is apparent here as details of the cast appear over the preparation for the initial robbery cut together effectively and precisely. The director fades the colour on these opening planning scenes and later also includes a brief and horrific flashback in black and white. There are two robberies in the film central points about which much of the drama revolves carried off with some flair by the participants and the editing department. There's something of the flair of Hong Kong crime cinema as the masked villains burst into shops and offices to make their killing'. Elsewhere things flag a little  especially in the unconvincing Sunny  Rafe relationship played respectively by an aggressive Ellen Barkin and the normally excellent Lance Henriksen. Sadly the character and motivations of the chief villain remains onedimensional and Rafe's barearmed menace never rises above stereotype. Sedley struggles to first rebuild his face then his life while courting the rather insipid Donna Elizabeth McGovern and hatching his master plan. Although his motivation for revenge is clear in between surgery and larceny he rather languishes. Donna is a nice girl' either nave or forgiving however one choses to see her whose role in the final denouement is also deemed nice work'. This vaguely pejorative epithet as well as her illjudged covering up for a former boyfriend provide her character's most defining moments. Her presence fails to give Sedley the impetus he needs and her final abduction is sadly predictable.  The attempt to work up another major character this time through the doctorwithasocialconscience who treats Sedley a peculiarly bewhiskered Forest Whitaker is only partially successful. After a brief couple of confrontations with the implacable and splendidly named police Lieutenant A. Z. Drones Morgan Freeman he disappears. On the plus side Rourke gives a generally good performance being especially affecting in the scene when he examines his new face. Despite the limitations of the script and even with the affected mumble the actor avoids dropping into bathos in this critical scene actually convincing the viewer of his pleasure in his new identity. His convincing gratitude to those who have changed his appearance pays dividends at the end of the film during his confrontation with the vengeful Rafe. Rafe's pummeling of Sedley's face and vicious attack on his newlyconstituted features with a knife is truly disturbing precisely because Rourke has so successfully communicated the humanity behind the criminal and surgical subject earlier.As Drones whose dogged perseverance reminds one of Inspector Javert in Les Miserables Freeman is excellent. An actor whose distinctive tones and modulated performances give class to any film he raises his part far above the lines he is given here and goes a way in making up for weaknesses elsewhere. During his few prison scenes with Rourke in fact one can shut one's eyes listen to his voice and summon up the much greater pleasures of The Shawshank Redemption 1994.  It is he who recognises the reality at the centre of the film that Sedley can change his appearance but can never change what is inside of himself or where it will lead  I know what you are' he says to the felon at one point. And we both know where you're going don't we Johnny?' At the close of the film after bullets have flown and dust settled Sedly finally acknowledges this fact using an ironic phrase which implies both physical and moral assessment  How do I look?'.Fans of Rourke and Freeman will certainly want to see this film although others will find there is rather less to it than meets the eye. Ry Cooder a regular collaborator with the director turns in a superb score full of slide guitar work with dramatic bass lines for the action sequences. This makes one regret that the final package to which he contributed so valiantly is ultimately so unmemorable. Admirers of Hill wanting to see one of his late urban thrillers with more interest will be better off with Trespass of three years later.".

It's a powerful film and i really felt sorry for Rourke's character. It kept me hooked all the way through with it's disturbing images and and interesting story. The ending is very sad and Henriksen is really brutal  and extremely menacing as the main villain. Perfect casting choices all around i truly enjoyed this movie. The Direction is very good. Walter Hill does a very good job here keeping the film at an excellent pace and keeping it grim and engrossing throughout!. There is a bit of blood. We get lots of extremely bloody gunshot wounds harsh bloody beatings and some knife slices. The Acting is EXCELLENT!. Mickey Rourke is AMAZING here  he is one of the most underrated actors out there his performance here is simply amazing he is extremely likable and ya really feel for him his chemistry with Elizabeth McGovern is very good and overall i just really dig this guy. Ellen Barkin is good here but got on my nerves a couple times and i though she over did it at times as well. Elizabeth McGovern is good with what she had to do and had good chemistry with Rourke decent looking as well.Morgan Freeman is AMAZING here as always he is very likable and did his job extremely well! he is one of the best actors of all time in my opinion. Lance Henriksen is is also AWESOME as as always he can do this role in his sleep but damn is he fun to watch! and he was extremely menacing. Forest Whitaker is good as the doctor i liked him. Overall i highly suggest you see this one! 12 out of 5".

	schema:headline " Look beyond the obvious. Johnny Handsome.";
	schema:reviewBody "When I watched the movie Johnny Handsome over again. I saw it from a whole new perspective. Other commentators that I've read here looked at the movie only as to character development and ongoing plot continuity. They never looked at the movie as a human interest story! A glimpse into a possible life lived in just the way it was presented! The story of a such a person who may have actually lived and who may have had the experiences that the character of John had deformed as he was and so may have had to reacted in exactly the way he did? It's all the figment of some writer's imagination but stretch your own mind enough to envelope this concept of this one man's life yourself? Saying Mickey Rourke cannot act is a very shortsighted and erroneous statement to make after exploring the complexities of this character's existence overall. Mickey Rourke had the depth and the finely tuned sensitivity to convey the hopelessness of spirit and also the continual confusion of a totally scarred and horribly deformed and therefore ugly and repulsive singular human entity. John started out being socially unassertivebereft of other contemporaries visibly embarrassed and yet at the same time pseudoaggressive and drawn to the criminal element. Understandably so due to his low selfesteem which is a byproduct of his offputting facial deformities. Mickey wore that face as if he truly had been born with it in reality. John's motivation for getting revenge on the two miscreants that had plotted against him and his friend in the robbery and then killed his friend and wounded him was the fact that although he was hideous to the world at large that one man had treated him as a person a confidant due in part to John's unique skills and befriended him not as a horribly deformed freak but as a peer albeit a peer in criminal activities. Even though after his operation John became a new man just like everybody else acceptable to the general population. This to the point of even attracting a normal caring woman to his new self. That wasn't enough to have changed his already well developed antisocial unreasonable and skewered psyche. That part of him that would always be unacceptable in a so called normal world. So when the chance to avenge his only true friend one who had included John in his former incarnation into his own bleak life routinely how could John with his scarred sensibilities turn from the possibility of making a repayment he felt he owed this to Mikey? That alone would have driven John at any cost to figure out a way in which ever way he could to destroy the two characters played so viciously and perfectly by the actors Hendrikson and Barkin. He fought their fire with his fire. Really this was the only way John knew and the only option that was opened to him. A new face wouldn't have changed that. How could a person watching this movie expect rationality? I didn't comment on the Freeman character Drones because he just did what you would expect a cop to do. See a criminal and try to find him doing something wrong. Then take him in. Freeman did this very accurately.He did his job as usual. Still the old adage applies here with Mickey's character John Walk a mile in another's shoes before you judge him. I feel so sorry for people who watch movies with their mind and leave their heart and humanity completely out of it. They miss so much.".

It's a very bleak violent film about a deformed crook nicknamed Johnny Handsome.

While in prison a friendly doctor gives Johnny the opportunity to get facial reconstructive surgery and a chance at a new life. But all he wants is revenge.All of the actors in the film are great Mickey Rourke's sullen and mysterious Johnny Morgan Freeman as the detective who won't buy that Johnny has reformed and best of all Barkin and Hendrickson as two criminals who seem to dislike each other as much as they dislike everyone else.My rating 810".

Great cast led by Rourke as the disfigured ironically named cheap crook of the title. A crook who is wronged and uses a controversial facial surgery to seek revenge against the scumbags that killed Johnny's friend framed him and tried to kill him twice.Director Walter Hill was on a tear in the late 70's until the mid 80's with a certain revival period in the 90's when he dipped his toe into the Western Genre. This movie features several actors at the peak of their powers including Morgan Freeman before he was typecast as a goodnatured paternalistic friend i.e. in The Bucket List or Shawshank Redemption. Ellen Barkin and Lance Henriksen are suitably over the top and Forrest Whitaker inhabits his character with compassion and sensitivity. The only possible weak link is a miscast Elizabeth McGovern doing a painfully bad CajunCreole accent. The city of New Orleans previously featured in Hill's Hard Times with Charles Bronson is also a strong presence throughout. Overall rating 8 out of 10.".

Estevez does a good job for a beginning director and doesn't try to overdo it. Sheen and Estevez are good not great together as they were in 'Young Guns'. Keith David is the solid part of the movie his portrayal as the 'exmilitary' Viet Nam Veteran asked to baby sit garbage men carries the movie with his unpredictable cop hating nature. Leslie Hope is very nice to look at and give credit to Estevez makes her character a strong one not a helpless female as women once were portrayed in movies.

Leslie Hope is very nice to look at and give credit to Estevez makes her character a strong one not a helpless female as women once were portrayed in movies. Movie has given me much enjoyment over the years as my children enjoyed playing garbage men around the house in their younger days.";

The city councilmen is also involved in this scheme.However this is all a loose plot for the hilarious shenanigans that ensue with Carl and James Sheen and Estevez their observer Louis Keith David and a couple of unlucky cops.Keith David comes close to stealing the show from Estevez and Sheen with his character of Louis a Vietnam vet who still suffers from a bit of shellshock. He sees everything through the eyes of war and this makes for some hilarious sequences particularly when the friendly pizza delivery man is kidnapped.All in all this is mindless but funny entertainment. It is funnier than 90 of the comedies made these days and many have never seen or heard of this film.It should be noted that the VHS tape is out of print although Amazon.com did release it as an Amazon Exclusive but it is now on special order. It can still be found at some rental locations but has also yet to be released on DVD I believe MGM has the rights to the film but I'm not positive. Here's to hoping we see a DVD sometime soon!Grade A".

Neither am I when I sit down and watch a comedy about two looser garbage men played by the Estevez brothers. This flick is what it is and in that respect it's amazing. Sure the last 25mins are total garbage but what comes before has me and my friends rolling on the floor in hysterics. Here's these two idiots they seem to have no friends besides themselves and their relations with women appear to consist of the odd peep into their windows or occasional stalking. They suck at their job and have the local cops hating them for what appears to be a variety of reasons we are not privy to. What flows within this basic framework is a ridiculous 'adventure' in which the boys attempt to solve a local crime and avoid a murder rap by dragging a dead body around ala 'Weekend at Bernie's. Add to the mix the always amazing Keith David playing an insane Vietnam vet who is charged with monitoring their activities on the job but only ends up being crazier than the ?Sheens? ever could be Never EVER touch another man's fries. The antics reach a fever pitch when David's character kidnaps the Pizza Boy played by that dude who played 'Chainsaw in Summer School. Eventually the dead body dons a Nixon mask and the traditional we couldn't think of a funny ending so here's some lame action sequence ensues See D.C. Cab. I usually stop the film here. You don't need to finish 'Men at Work' to love it. The pratical jokes the memories of DaNang and of course the infamous Pellet gun make the first hour worth every minute. A comedy classic ... at least I think so.".

Now they are scared that the police may think that they had something to do with it so they just carry the corpse with them all day and try to find the real killers.  It is as stupid as it sounds. Estevez must have gotten some of his inspiration from Weekend at Bernie's. However as previously mentioned there are some very funny moments.  Keith David and Dean Cameron both do good work as they get involved with the action as well.  There is no real direction and the screenplay never does come together.  Not much to sing about here.  2.5 out of 5 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Men at Work is written and directed by Emilio Estevez who also costars with brother Charlie Sheen Keith David Leslie Hope Dean Cameron and John Getz. Music is by Stewart Copeland and photography out on locations that include beaches at Redondo and Hermosa is by Tim Suhrstedt. Plot finds Estevez James and Sheen Carl as two carefree garbage collectors who find a dead body in a barrel during their rounds. Trouble is is that the dead guy is the man Sheen shot with his pellet gun the previous evening. Thinking they might be responsible for his death and prompted by their newly acquired chaperon cop hating Louis Fedders David they unwisely decide not to call in the cops. So with an unhinged Vietnam War vet and a dead body on their hands Carl and James are in big trouble.Undemanding picture that's more enjoyable if you happen to be a fan of either Sheen or Estevez Men at Work often struggles for laughs but is intermittently lit up by the odd humorous moment that comes with a side order of cool. There's a little drama in the mix and even a delicate hint of social commentary via the illegal toxic waste dumping core that the frivolity is wrapped around. But really this is all about the two Brat Packers running free and Keith David superbly stealing the movie from the both of them. When the we got a dead body to keep from the cops comedy runs out of steam and it does a little too early in the piece it's left to David to bring the laughs with his cop hating rants and coiled spring like intensity ready to unleash on anyone who gets in the way or dares to eat his fries. Hope is amiable and pretty though she only serves as a love interest for Sheen while Getz isn't in it much and the two hit men on the boys tail don't bring anything new to that well trodden comedy table.When it hits its comedy stride the funny sequences that drop in are just that funny golf clap the nasty human waste exploding balloons Keith David but these moments only serve to highlight the scripts shortcomings elsewhere. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "When one looks back at this film released in 1990 thus displaying all the characteristics of the 80's one's first reaction might be to deride it as cheap or at least silly. That being said the more one watches it the easier it becomes to identify the factors that make this a classic even if it's of the cult variety. For one the movie never takes itself too seriously. Two despite some of the jokes falling into the badoomching category much of the humor is genuine and one or two running themes are paid off quite well. Third and most importantly there are a handful of good performances in the movie Sheen and Estevez are excellent together not to mention their 80's style haircuts as are their two rival trash men played by Geoffrey Blake and Cameron Dye. Interestingly the movie contains quite a few pairings of characters if you will with a duo of hired thugs and tandem of selfimportant bicycle cops beautifully adding to the humor. However the finest performance in the film might come from Keith David who plays the deranged and imbalanced veteran Louis Fedders. All things considered this is not cinematic genius personified. In fact by today's standards this is a garden variety comedy. However neither of those statements diminish in any way my enjoyment of this film and I fully recommend it to any fan of Sheen or anyone who enjoys a good bluecollar comedy. So in that vein I salute you Carl Taylor and James St. James!!!".

All the characters are pretty cool and the story is a lot of fun plus Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez are simply amazing in this!. This is seriously underrated and should be higher then 5.4 in my opinion and while it's nothing great movie wise the movie is hilarious and is totally fun all the way plus Keith David is an absolute riot as the psycho Vietnam guy!. It's also very good as a Buddy Buddy movie and it's very well made and written by Emilio Estevez plus it had some funny action scenes as well. I laughed my ass off when Charlie Sheen shot the mayor in the ass with a pellet gun and it was also amusing when David Keith went nuts on the pizza delivery guy! plus it had some really funny lines as well. John Getz is fun as the villainand Charlie and Emilio really impressed me with there fighting skills plus the ending was very funny. This is great fun for everyone I really enjoyed it everyone in the cast was great especially Emilio and Charlie who worked incredibly well together I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Emilio Estevez does a great job here with very good camera work and keeping the film very funny throughout. The Acting is lots of fun!. Emilio Estevez is amazing as always and is amazing here he is extremely hilarious seemed to be enjoying himself had amazing chemistry with Sheen had a really cool character and cracked me up throughout Emilio Rules!!!!!. Charlie Sheen is also amazing here he had amazing chemistry with Emilio had a great sense of humor played a really cool character also had good chemistry with Leslie Hope and put a grin on my face throughout Sheen Rules!!!!!. Keith David is absolutely hilarious as the psycho Vietnam guy he added some great humor really seemed to be having fun I would love to see him work in a sequel with Emilio and Charlie he stole a lot of the scenes!. Leslie Hope is hot and well with what she had to do I liked her. Dean Cameron is funny as the pizza delivery guy and as a hostage I dug him. John Getz is fun as the villain and didn't take himself seriously. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. 12 out of 5 here's to a hopeful sequel!".

So far I've seen a movie where Charlie teamed up with his Dad Cadence and one where Emilio teamed up with his Dad The War at Home. This is the first time I saw the two of them on screen together other than a short scene in National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1. There's many funny moments including one where the two of them are hanging off the back doors of a truck.  It's not a very smart comedy but it's damn entertaining.  Emilio shows his talent behind the camera as well.  And I liked hearing that song Pump Up the Jam which I haven't heard in a while. The plot is predictable and nothing special.  Basically you gotta be in it for the laughs and the fun.  My score  7 out of 10".

And if you thought that movie was funny well then you'll have trouble locking and loading your funny sac after seeing 'Men at Work' truly a great film.To paraphrase two garbagemenJames Emilio Estevez and Carlare in dire straits. Few films had tackled the plight of American garbagemen before 1990. And after this movie there is really no need because never has the job been portrayed so accurately on the silver screen. In supporting roles Leslie Hope and Keith David are spectacularific never again would they get roles that afforded them such creative balance in the rest of their careers.The deeper social message is further conveyed when brothers Carl and James find the body of a politician in the trash in a scene that though today might seem tame was in 1990 and preSept 11 a very daring and controversial move by director and star Estevez. Also there is the evil corporate powers that want to dump toxic waste into the Pacific Ocean. These scenes are really where the movie shines making it the most thoughtprovoking examination of environmental issues since Frogs 1972.When I first saw this movie a few years ago I knew there was something special in the chemistry between Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez. Later that year by the watercooler at my office a coworker informed me that the two actors are in fact brothers! Wow I thought and moments later said. You will express similar amazement at this awesome film which I give  four stars. I only hope that like the Incredible String Band this movie will someday get the appreciation it never recieved in its own time.".

This is a candid travelogue surrounding Woody's 1996 tour of Europe where he was booked with his New Orleans Jazz Band to play a series of engagements. The camera follows Allen along with Soon Yi Previn and his sister on the plane in hotel rooms on the streets with appreciative fans and of course on the stage when Woody's performing his favorite music. It's a pretty safe bet that a good chunk of the paying audience was in attendance not so much to hear the jazz as to catch a live glimpse of their favorite movie star and that's sort of the case with us too. The occasional concert performances are pleasant enough but they're not the most valuable elements of the movie for most fans things really come alive when we get to see Allen being himself behind the scenes getting jittery while riding in his boat in Venice getting grossed out at the thought of a dog licking his face cautioning people at a press conference that he's claustrophobic struggling with an uncooperative clarinet and musing over the respect his films receive in Europe as opposed to their indifference at home. It becomes quite amazing to see firsthand just how much of his true persona is actually what he uses to flesh out those crazy characters he plays in all his films. Nowhere is it more evident just how Woody may have wound up so endearingly neurotic than it is when he returns home to New York at the end of the film. It's then that we meet his stillliving parents who seem to do everything in their power to discredit him after his long trip dad is more interested in the quality of the engraving on Woody's overseas awards rather than being complimentary toward the honor itself mom reminds her son not to think he made it famous all on his own and doesn't pull punches when she gives her opinion of Woody's choice of woman.WILD MAN BLUES is not meant for just your average movie lover but if you're a genuine fan of Woody Allen and his films you really should catch it.  out of ".

Talented director actor writer and very creative and at times surrounded by some controversial but still a genius. Barbara Kopple's documentary Wild Man Blues brings us a little more closer to the man who has an very enthusiastic passion for jazz playing the clarinet with his jazz band reason why he never attended the Academy Awards he only went in 2002 to make a tribute to New York or any other awards show. Following Woody along with SoonYi we have the pleasure to watch the director of classics like Hannah and Her Sisters and Bullets over Broadway on a tour in Europe doing what he likes the most playing music showing his skills with the clarinet and he's a good player by the way entertaining audiences with the old New Orleans jazz and boy he got some really big crowds to his shows treated like a rock star.More than just the tour this is an intimate portrait of Woody Allen his life and his work his views on music and films his relation with SoonYi and even a family breakfast with Woody's parents. There's plenty of space and time to enjoy his hobby and watch the man making jokes all the time at times a little depressed or a little bit cranky but never being snob or arrogant as some of his written interviews tend to sound. Some shocking revelations such as the fact of SoonYi watched all of Woody's films except Annie Hall or when Woody discussed about getting a Life Achievement Award by the DGA when Fellini never got one he and us can't understand that. Greater than all that is his jokes whatever the occasion talking about the people he sees on the way They won't pay ten cents to see one of my movies but passing in a gondola they love it. or talking to SoonYi about the concierge of the luxury hotel they stayed in. It's delightful to see when he talks about the films that failed at boxoffice in America but are a huge hit all over Europe Interiors Another Woman and others. And if you pay attention to his opinions you'll see that most of them will be referred in his future films e.g. when he says about suffering of chronic dissatisfaction. He quoted that in Vicky Cristina Barcleona. Or the way he richly describes Paris place where he would make the film that gave his 4th Oscar this year Midnight in Paris. It's all there!Entertainment and reality at its best Wild Man Blues allows us to know a little better about the creator of cinematic masterpieces presenting the man in a different way than we're used to see ok he's less neurotic than the characters he play.

It's curious to see how their relationship goes in the film what is and what isn't shown and this is I think when Kopple gets the most personal even if it's a little uncomfortably so. Indeed this is an Allen that is not really like the one he portrays in film after film it does have the moments of humor and his neuroses are in full view of the lens. But by giving it this extra view it shows him as much more of a relatable person or maybe not the film does show him in Europe as being far more celebritylike than here. In all it works best as an objective view of the subject matter of a director who also happens to be a good musician who enjoys playing what he calls crude...esoteric music of old. It is at least for the Woody admirer entirely watchable.".

He reacts with a warm smile and a little bit of sarcasm when every day he is told a dozen times you are the greatest I love your movies mostly your earlier and funny ones why cant you go on making funny movies.... However Wild Man Blues is a very funny film.";

I think it's a little bit sad that all these people wants to see him because he's a famous actor and director and not because of the music he and his partners seems to love so much.  That happens to be my favorite kind of jazz Jelly Roll Morton! Yeah! and the band are doin' it in a very attractive way.  This movie should be just about music.".

	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen and the New Orleans Jazz Band set out on a tour of eighteen cities in seven countries in Europe.  Accompanying them is Barbara Kopple who has been given total access to the musician and filmmaker Allen as he does the shows and the time in between.  The end result is a documentary that takes in Allen's love for this rather crude' form of jazz but also allows for some insights into his personal life his relationship with Soon Yi and his famous obsessions and neuroses.I bought this film as a Woody Allen fan and as someone who while not a fan certainly enjoys a bit of old fashioned jazz music on a hot sunny night. For both these reasons I enjoyed this film even though the description of it as a documentary' is maybe not the most fitting as it implies a certain amount of probing into the subject.  Rather than digging Kopple basically just seems to point the camera and leave it running.  She doesn't really ask any questions of Allen or his family and seems content to let him and his companions just talk freely  it made me wonder how many countless hours of footage she must have shot to come up with what she uses here.  So if you are looking for insight in Allen then you won't get it here.  Likewise if you are looking for a great deal of discussion or insight into the music then you'll be let down in this area Kopple also mostly just films the band playing.That is not to say that the film is bad because it isn't but there isn't a great deal of substance to it unless you are Woody Allen fan.  As a fan there isn't a great deal of insight into Allen's life or situation  the conclusion we are left with is no more of an understanding than we started with that he is a witty little man who is filled with little complexes and neuroses while also being a very private person.  The value of the film is that we actually get to see that during the course of the movie.  Allen is funny and quite relaxed but a real' documentary would have pushed harder into the darker issues of Allen's life  many viewers will be annoyed by how the film just accepts Soon Yi without ever really asking any questions or even hinting at the many issues behind their relationship.Overall I enjoyed this film but then I like Woody Allen's humour and was interested to seeing if his onscreen personae is similar to his real life character.  However it isn't really insightful and it is only a scene near the end with Allen and his parents yeah  I was surprised they were still alive too! that gives a little background and is interesting.  A light witty and quite enjoyable film but I can't imagine that anyone other than fans of Woody Allen and jazz will get a great deal from this.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been a Woody Allen fan most of my life. I enjoyed his silly era Bananas Sleeper his playful stuff Annie Hall Hannah and Her Sisters and especially his thoughtful movies Crime And Misdemeanors Manhattan. I'll leave the last decade or so alone since making a movie a year has got repetitious and somewhat stale.All that said I remain a fan and was excited to see a documentary on Encore of his 90's European tour with his New Orleans Jazz Band. I have seen him perform with his band so I knew the quality of his playing and his excellent band would add to any enjoyment of the movie. Helmed by an award winning director I was most interested in that phase of his life. The timeframe was shortly after he announced his love for his exlover's adopted daughter SoonYi Previn. Their relationship prior to their marriage is depicted here with no intimate moments but they have a nice gentle chemistry with each other. She encourages him mildly scolds him comforts him and seems to enjoy their trip. Despite being 35 years younger she seems to be the more travel savvy even the more adult of the two. This is probably because Woody is out of his New York routine. He is followed every foot of the way by photographers has pre and post concert functions to attend and must stay in suites that are a tad pretentious to his NY roots. Its fun to watch if a bit sterile. As expected much of the film is dedicated to his on stage playing and it is decidedly good. His band is in excellent form. The crowds are very appreciative almost all adoring fans. While the crowd in Rome is a bit stoic Woody still plays his 90 minute plus show.There are some eavesdropped conversation that show his wit and some of his foibles he must have his own bathroom he seems to always be starving etc.. His conversation with fans and even his parents bounce from appreciative to impatient but mostly seem fair. He is able to come and go as he pleases in NYC but is pushed and prodded pretty good here.The most telling quote about his life is summed up by a roof top conversation with SoonYi. He admits that he loves NY and loves Europe but....he'd always rather be in NY when he's in Europe and Europe when he's home. He admits that it is difficult to enjoy things given that phobia. I enjoyed having a camera's eye there for me to observe. The odd and soundly criticized relationship with SoonYi seems to have withstood the test of time. Woodman keep playing your music!!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a documentary account of Allen's tour of Europe with his New Orleans jazz band. Barbara Kopple directs effectively and seems to have the ability to be there at the crucial moment without the scenes looking staged or faked. I do not know if the film is a deliberate attempt to counter the bad publicity Allen received over his affair with the teenage SoonYi. Certainly the now 27 yearold SoonYi appears to be the dominant one of the partnership like a kindly but strict mother controlling the behaviour of her naughty child. I particularly enjoyed the breakfast scene in Madrid where she gently scolds Allen for not showing sufficient appreciation to the members of his band. She orders Spanish omelette because it seems to be the appropriate thing to have and then makes Allen eat it because it tastes like rubber. The final scene is fascinating with Allen and SoonYi back in New York visiting Allen's parents both in their 90s. Both parents are dismissive of Allen's achievements and his mother confesses that she wanted him to marry a nice Jewish girl.Allen's clarinet playing is variable. He seems to be having trouble with his reed throughout the tour. On good nights he sounds like a reasonable George Lewis imitator on a bad night in Paris he could barely coax a note out of his instrument. The audiences loved him apart from a bejewelled invited audience in Rome that clapped politely and sat wearing bemused smiles throughout the performance".

But the thing that stays with me the most is the high quality of Allen's trenchant observations on the passing parade on mundane matters such as his thoughts on the note he composes for inclusion in his hotel laundry. I am not a fan of the slick glib oneliners Allen became known for early in his career but in this film we have a more mature person a man who obviously cherishes the relationship with Soon Yi and who respects his parents after life has smoothed the edges of his angst and has enabled him it seems to gain deeper insights into the passing parade.".

Barbara Kopple a director that has made a name for herself in this type of genre tails a notorious man whose neurosis has translated into many films about himself. Woody Allen has been on the scene for quite a while now. He has enjoyed a long career but actually the focus of the tour is not about the filmmaker but about the closet musician he is at heart.We are taken aboard the private jet that is taking him to Paris. He is accompanied by SoonYi Previn his wife since 1997. His sister Letty Aronson who is connected with Mr. Allen having produced most of the films her brother has directed has also come along. The first stop is Paris a city Mr. Allen deems one of the most beautiful in Europe. In fact it is to Paris where the director always flies to whenever he goes to Europe because from there he gets himself into his European mood.Although there were other cities in the tour only a few places are showcased in the documentary. Italy is prominently featured in the documentary. Venice is the place where Mr. Allen and Ms. Previn got married so it seems to be a place where they enjoy going back to. A ride on a gondola makes Mr. Allen seasick. In Milan the couple is given the biggest suite at the Principe di Savoia Hotel something that create a problem for the director because of its vastness and for SoonYi because of the lack of hot water in the showers. Mr. Allen has a few quirks. He will always have an extra room in order to have privacy in his bathroom. His laundry must be done just so. His nostalgia for New York a city where he can function freely is challenged by the new places he visits. The worst part of the tour is Rome because of a stiff crowd that seemed to have gone to the concert because it was included in the price of dinner.Ms. Kopple has a rare treat for her fans for last. As Woody Allen and SoonYi come home they are visited by his parents. His mother a vivacious lady with a nononsense attitude is not impressed by the trophies the mementos her son received during the trip. Her ambition in life was for her son to be a pharmacist. It would have been a dream come true for her that and a nice Jewish girl for him. Alas neither of those wishes came true.The material for the documentary is excellent. Ms. Kopple gets the essence of the man his music and his daily life making this genial man somebody approachable and human.".

But I still think I can understand and enjoy it the way Woody Allen says he enjoys it.This movie is a complete train wreck. I remember Francis Ford Coppola was contemplating suicide on film because he thought Apocalypse Now was going to turn out to be a complete and utter failure or an unfinished project. I could imagine the director of this documentary coming to the same conclusions.The problem is Woody Allen is a more interesting character when he is writing or performing. Watching this movie shows us how average his life is when taking into account the small things that make up life. This movie could have just as well been about a plumber unclogging pipes or a mail man delivering mail. I don't see what makes a movie about a famous director staying in hotels grasping in any intellectual philosophical or emotional fashion.And that is basically what this movie is. Its him and his wife staying in hotels going on airplanes and doing gigs. The gigs eventually get as boring as the airplane rides. The movie feels more like a reality show than a documentary. Do we care that hot water was not working in Woody Allen's hotel? Do we care that he would rather get bitten by a dog than licked by one? Do we care about the omelets Woody Allen's wife orders for breakfast? If any of use answered yes to any of those questions maybe we should re watch some Woody Allen movies to see the qualities that we were most certainly missing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Barbara Kopple's 1998 documentary on filmmaker Woody Allen's 1996 tour of Europe with his New Orleans Jazz Band reputedly eighteen concerts and seven countries in twentythree days Wild Man Blues is one of the most pointless dull and utterly inert documentaries I've ever seen. I've long been a fan of Allen's films and even his worst films see The Curse Of The Jade Scorpion are a cut or three above their typical Hollywood counterparts. And Kopple is a noted documentarian of quality see Harlan County USA. But this film is nothing but a manifest ploy to rehabilitate the man's image after his 1991 scandal of splitting up with actress Mia Farrow and shacking up with her daughter.Documentaries are supposed to enlighten and give insight into their subject matter. This film does not even at a bloated hour and fortyfive minutes in length. This could have been cut to an hour with ease had most of the execrable jazz been cut. It's not that the music is so bad as the fact that Allen and his compatriots are so utterly meager. Without Allen the rest of the musicians could never have gotten a gig at a bar mitzvah.But the real problem with Wild Man Blues is that Allen is never allowed to display his wit and intellect. There are a few good Vaudevillean one liners a lady says to Allen 'You are so intelligent' and he replies 'Well yes. It is a burden though sometimes. With this much intelligence comes great responsibility. You know. It's lonely at the top.' but mostly endless scenes of Allen blowing on his clarinet making nice with SoonYi in their chichi hotel digs hobnobbing with sycophantic mayors of European cities who give him the keys to their respective cities and a number of oddball scenes that serve no purpose in the narrative such as a French fan who disbelieves Allen has any prowess as a musician only to after the show become a true convert. I mean did the filmmaker Kopple really believe the viewer would be surprised or enlightened that the man had changed his opinion? There are about two minutes devoted to the scandal an equal amount of time on Allen discussing his films but absolutely nada on Allen's career in stand up comedy early television much less his day to day life before and during celebrity. So again what was the point for this film save to burnish Allen's reputation as a human being?Perhaps that is good enough to carry a film if it provides a modicum of the other qualities previously mentioned. But Wild Man Blues does not. Even for Allen fans who define the original intent of the term as fanatic this film is something of coitus sans ejaculation. Nowhere do we get a glimpse of Allen unguarded do we really believe that he and SoonYi in white robes eating a gourmet Spanish breakfast is a revelation of any sort? Of course that question would be better addressed to director Kopple who made a highly regarded Oscar winning1976 documentary called Harlan County U.S.A. about a miner's strike as well as many others but in this film seems to be on cruise control.At best Wild Man Blues is a competent little film a travelogue with a celebrity but not one which will leave a lasting impression to the uninterested observer even if it does occasionally appeal to the architecture lover out there. There are no great techniques nor style explored the way an Errol Morris or Ken Burns documentary is manifestly theirs. Thus this film is recommended only for Allen fans who desire to have the man's whole oeuvre as director writer actor or what not. And yes I am one of those people. But for the rest of you go watch Another Woman or Stardust Memories. Trust me on that!".

	schema:reviewBody "Wild Man Blues Barbara Kopple's 1997 documentary about Woody Allen's tour of Europe with his New Orleans jazz band is both rare and interesting on some levels. It was also disheartening on others. Allen a fairly prolific clarinetist travels the major cities in Europe with his band a tour that is an extension of their regular Monday night gigs at Michael's a jazz club in New York. Presumably this is his first tour and Woody is his regular angsty self fretting over whether people are there for the music or to see him. While the musicians really stand up in terms of quality Allen included it is pretty clear that the majority of the concert attendees are there for Allen the Icon whose films are immensely more popular overseas than they are here.The film is not outstanding in terms of production but more importantly the camera acts as a fly on the wall perspective on someone who is not particularly comfortable in the public eye. His amazement at the scores of people who attend his concerts wait for him at the concert hall and outside his hotel is almost comical and the paparazzi are insatiable particularly since the film was made a short time after the whole MiaWoodySoonYi scandal. The scene I found most intriguing of all actually occurs during the last ten minutes of the film and that is when he returns home after the tour and goes to visit his parents with SoonYi and his sister who accompanied him on the tour. The fact that his parents still feel that he would have been better off as a pharmacist and that his acting thing isn't all that great yet get defensive when he seems to take sole credit for his creativity was very interesting.When the Woody Allen scandal broke during the 1990's I was one of his most ardent supporters an opinion that was extremely popular regardless of any reasoning. Throughout it all I couldn't help but wonder what he saw in this woman but I never questioned his morals in choosing her to be his companion. I just assumed that being as intelligent as he is she must be his intellectual and spiritual match. Unfortunately that image was shattered for me with this film because she came across not only as completely vapid but ignorant and not personable at all. She was obviously acting for the camera and really ended up being a hindrance to the film in my opinion.As a documentary however Kopple provides us with a good piece of filmmaking though it is certainly a niche piece only fans of Allen or those curious about him will make it through the film much less appreciate it. 610 Shelly".

Keep in mind I was twelve but at that time it was the coolest movie ever. I even collected the ultrarare action figures I have them all except for the Bowler which is the hardest to find. They made Mr. Furious The Shoveler The Blue Raja The Spleen and Captain Amazing in case your wondering. There IS a William H. Macy action figure in existence!. I've watched it many times over the years and it still remains a favorite of mine due mostly to fond childhood memories. It's not a perfect movie but it definitely deserves another look and perhaps a cult following.The story a bunch of lowlevel superheroes save the day. This was executed again in the mediocre directtovideo The Specials as well. But this is the other end of the spectrum big budget huge budget almost 100 Million I think studio comedy. Yes the effects are overblown and the huge sets and wonderful production design are a bit much considering the plot. But don't think this as a stupid special effectsy superhero movieit's a PARODY. They fight a villain named Cassanova Frankenstein people. He has a psychofrakulator whatever that is it's a doomsday device he'll take over the world yada yada. And resident superhero Captain Amazing a Zapp Branniganesque Greg Kinnear with commercialproductlogos on his costume nice touch is kidnapped. Time for the Mystery Men Mr. Furious Ben Stiller gets mad The Shoveller William H. Macy beats people with shovels The Blue Raja Hank Azaria British throws forks The Bowler Janeane Garafolo bowls Invisible Boy Kel Mitchell guess what he does The Spleen the great Paul Reubens farts and The Sphinx Wes Studi cuts guns in half with his mind I am not kidding. The rest of the fantastic cast of character actors includes Geoffrey Rush as Cassanova Lena Olin heavily edited out as Cassanova's bride and the one and only Tom Waits as a crazy weapons dealer. So...with Macy Kinnear Olin and Rush there are four Oscarnominees and one winner and Tom freakin' Waits! It's not perfect though. It's overlong and there are some gushes of corniness here and there The Shoveller's full of them.The dialogue definitely outweighs the physical comedy which is sometimes lacking there's a guy who farts for his power case closed. The dialogue is definitely a highlight the cyclical ramblings of the Sphinx the mixed metaphors of Mr. Furious etc. It's downright a funny movie it will almost make you forget that this was the film that let All Star by Smashmouth out into the world. Unfortunately the film did not do as well with critics and audiences as it should have. A sequel was originally planned the film is in fact based on a comic book and characters from The Flaming Carrot comics. The Flaming Carrot was planned for the sequel I believe but this did not do well at the box office. It could have been a hard sell a superhero comedy with the guy from There's Something About Mary. It also could have been the fact that it was released on the same day as The Sixth Sensewhich ended up being the biggest hit for the month of Augustas well as The Thomas Crown Affair. Two other misunderstood classics were released on the same crowded weekend oddly enoughDick and The Iron Giant. Critics gave MM passable reviews but it was quickly forgotten. Sadly enough on Comedy Central's Roast of Jerry Stiller comedian Jeffrey Ross commented to Ben Stiller that I saw 'Mystery Men' and I fired MY agent. Ben is then seen to mouth the words I should have to. Don't listen to him. Give Mystery Men a chance.".

I mean there hasn't been a good superhero movie out for quite some time NOTE Batman Forever was NOT a good superhero movie.  I really wanted this film to be good and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema read Blair Witch Project I wasn't disappointed.Mystery Men was definitely not a higheffects tensionfilled action flick it was a comedy.  And on that basis it was a success.  It had everyone in the small theater laughing and got applause and laughs right through the final scene.  Stiller and Garofolo are hilarious together as always and Azaria adds just the right touch of craziness.  William H. Macy plays a great straight man while Kel Mitchell and the fartpowered Paul Rubens are added just to keep the kiddies happy.Though the sets are bizarre and at times seem like ripoffs from both Batman and Blade Runner and some of the jokes are obvious it is still just plain funny.  There are some lines that will catch even the most jaded viewer offguard and bring tears from the bellylaughers among us.I definitely recommend this movie.  Although not an alltime classic it is twice as funny as the latest Austin Powers retread.  The writing is good and the cast is GREAT.  If you're worried plan on the matinee and pay less but either way you'll be pleasantly surprised.  I mean who among us doesn't root for the losers once in a while?".

When an evil villain Casanova Frankenstein Geoffrey Rush is released from a mental institution captures the local superhero Captain Amazing Greg Kinnear and threatens to take over Champion City three wannabe superheroes Mr. Furious Ben Stiller The Shoveler William H. Macy and The Blue Raja Hank Azaria come to the rescue.  Frankenstein has been joined by a myriad assortment of underworld scum however and has become a formidable opponent.  The trio realize that help is needed and decide to recruit what they end up with is nothing less than the most unforgettable team of superheroes' ever assembled in the history of the cinema.  Mr. Furious has his rage The Shoveler his shovel The Blue Raja flings silverware mainly forks and the occasional spoon but never a knife the Invisible Boy Kel Mitchell can turn invisible as long as no one is watching the Sphinx Wes Studi a heavy hitter from down south is very mysterious and can break guns in half with his mind.  Maybe the Bowler Janeane Garofalo can fling a ball with deadly accuracy and The Spleen Paul Reubens wields flatulence that can incapacitate an entire room. This is a brilliant ensemble piece that delivers the laughs without ever becoming condescending or patronizing the audience while playing it straight at all times.  The dialogue is witty and the performances given by Stiller Macy Azaria and Garofalo are exemplary.  There is a number of memorable hilarious scenes especially the one in which they throw a pool party and barbecue to recruit and conduct interviews with a stupefying assemblage of applicants and another in a bar when the Bowler has a conversation with her longdead father whose skull has been implanted in her bowling ball.  The funniest of all however has to be when the team actually attempts to rescue Captain Amazing.  But these are only examples for the entire movie is composed of one hilarious scene after another laced with subtle humor that will keep you laughing and thinking about it for a long time.  The real secret of it's success though is that Usher keeps it all real the relationships between the characters are true and the whole concept of being a Superhero' is played as being entirely reasonable which somehow gives a sense of credibility to the entire proceedings.  In this world the aspirations of Mr. Furious and the rest are tenable and Usher keeps the laughs coming without ever resorting to slapstick or mere sight gags. The solid supporting cast includes Lena Olin Dr. Annabel Leek Eddie Izzard Tony P. Tom Waits Doc Heller Claire Forlani Monica Louise Lasser The Blue Raja's mother Jenifer Lewis Lucille and Pras Tony C.. Mystery Men' is a truly inspired movie that can be seen over and over again with a new chuckle to be had with every viewing guaranteed.  In the immortal words of the Sphinx We are number one!  All others are number two or lower.'  Is it an Oscarworthy movie?  Hardly but for a good time and a lot of laughs treat yourself to this masterwork of comedy it's the real deal and you won't regret it.  I rate this one 1010.".

This had a lovely subtle humor  despite most people probably looking only at the obvious. The actors portrayed their characters with aplomb and I thought there was a lot more personal personality in this film. Has appeal for kids as well as adults.

Esp. nice to find a good movie that's not filled with sexual references and drug innuendos! A great film not to be overlooked based on public consumption. This one is a must buy.";

So the greatest super hero Captain Amazing decides to manipulate a few things to keep his sponsorship and releases Cassanova Frankinstein. Unfortunately Cassanova gets the better of him and kills him so it is up to a hopeless trio the Blue Rajah The Shovel and Mr Furious to get him back. Unfortunately they are hopeless so they recruit some more landing up with the Invisible Man the Spleen and the Bowler's daughter. Then the Sphinx a mysterious figure turns up to train them.This movie which is actually based on a comic series of the same name is a farce of super hero movies. The mad inventor emphasises that all of his inventions are nonlethal the Blue Rajah throws spoons and forks but not knives the Shovel is married with kids and his wife tries to tell him that maybe the superhero business is not cut out for him and nobody finds Mr Furious threatening at all.It is a cute little movie and deals with these mystery men's right of ascension. Now that Captain Amazing is dead a new lot of super heroes are needed and unfortunately all they have are these guys. The Blue Rajah lives with his mother and Mr Furious is trying too hard to be something that he is not. In the end when Mr Furious comes to terms with who he really is a guy named Roy then he becomes Mr Furious.This is a pretty cool movie and I do recommend it but it is not one that stands out so much that one would want to see it again and again. I guess there is a little criticism here but in the end any comment that it would want to make simply falls down into a pool of laughs and weirdness. It may be weird but it is not the weird that makes me interested in the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I make just one apology for this film there are far far too many wide angle closeups and if they irritate you beyond endurance fair enough. They drove ME barmy for the first ten minutes or so.  But after that I made a kind of a truce with the terrible cinematography and long before the end of the film I had ceased to care.  This is too rich a comedy to be destroyed so easily.  It's hilarious it's witty the comic delivery of ALL of the cast is flawless and however much Usher peers at his characters through a cold fisheye lens  HE may not care for them much  he manages to present them with warmth.  Mystery Men' is in fact not only funnier not only more clever but also deeper than anyone seems to have given it credit for being.  The jokes in the Austin Powers movies for instance as well as being less funny than the jokes here are also much more toothless. The satire of Mystery Men' bites when there's something worth biting and gnaws gently when there isn't.  It doesn't mock just any old thing.  Which is why contrary to what some I must regard them as unobservant critics have said it never runs out of ideas.The super' heroes are an attractive bunch.  Sure they're secondrate but they're not merely second rate.  The Blue Rajah for instance does nothing but throw cutlery at people and he isn't THAT good at it.  On the other hand neither is he comically bad.  He's better in his limited field than most people and he DOES practise diligently.  He's not a buffoon which makes him a much funnier character than if he was.  If Superman is Christ in a cape the Mystery Men are all the minor demigods from the foothills of Mount Olympus in capes.  Much funnier also much more endearing.".

They drove ME barmy for the first ten minutes or so.  But after that I made a kind of a truce with the terrible cinematography and long before the end of the film I had ceased to care.  This is too rich a comedy to be destroyed so easily.  It's hilarious it's witty the comic delivery of ALL of the cast is flawless and however much Usher peers at his characters through a cold fisheye lens  HE may not care for them much  he manages to present them with warmth.

They have talents in strange areas however that the real heroes don't and don't want to!.

The language was tame so kids could enjoy this too. In fact I don't recall any swearing in here except the guy in the theater next to me who kept uttering What a dumb fing movie.

This movie contained a couple of the funniest bits of writing I have ever seen from a motion picture. Now am not saying this is one of the funniest movies of all time but I laughed pretty hard at some parts. The police ruled my father's death a suicide. They said he fell down an elevator shaft. Onto some bullets. Now this movie is not for everybody its mostly stupid humor like Zoolander or Dodgeball so if you hated these movies I would probably recommend you to steer clear. Overall it was an enjoyable movie about a group of superhero wannabes who end up becoming real heroes in the end. It's a vastly overrated comedy that many people probably haven't seen yet because like me before viewing it expected it to be utter garbage. After viewing this film I finally understand why this movie was able to assemble such a superstar cast which includes Ben Stiller William H. Macy Hank Azaria and even that kid from Good Burger. It's because Mystery Man is full of excellent comedic writing period 7 out of 10. A very big surprise.".

Anyone wanting to pigeonhole films into neat little categories is fighting a losing battle.  This is a spoofparody of the superhero genre  from the pseudoBurton sets recycled endlessly and occasionally decorated with more spoof material to the ridiculous costumes the comicbook genre gets a pretty good sendup.  But at the same time it is a serious superhero flick as well.  Both at once. While not a necessarily unique idea in itself for example this movie is in some ways reflective of D.C. Comic's shortlived Inferior Five work it is fairly innovative for the big screen.  It offers the comicbook world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway then throws in the inevitable wannabes  and we all know if superheroes were real so would these guys be real.  If the Big Guy with the S were flying around New York City you'd see a halfdozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their butts kicked on a regular basis.  Sure the Shoveller fights pretty well and the Blue Raja hurls forks with great accuracy  all parts of the superhero world.  But does that make them genuine superheroes?  Only in their minds.This movie is also a comedy albeit a dark one.  Inevitable when trying to point out the patent ridiculous nature of superheroics.  Oneliners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of. Particularly marvelous is the dialogue by Janeane Garofalo with her bowling ballfather.  Yet it isn't a comedy in the sense of sidesplitting laughter or eternally memorable jokes.  It mixes in a dose of drama of discovery and of romance but never really ventures fully into any of it.What really makes Mystery Men a good film in the end is that it is very engaging.  The weaklame good guys are eventually justified and for one shining moment really become superheroes  justice is served  and the movie ends with a scene that reeks of realism as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise.  If the viewer stops trying to label the film then the film can be a great romp.Of course no movie is perfect.  Claire Forlani comes off as bored and directionless as Mr. Furious' love interest in spite of having a pivotal role as his conscience.  Tom Waits seems somehow confused by his own lines as the mad inventor Dr. Heller although his opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone.  And the villians are never more than guntoting lackeys a point of which is made in the film.  The cinematography is choppy and disjointed such as happens in the average comic book so it is excusable the music sometimes overpowers the scenery and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very well.Yet overall this film is incredible.  You probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie but it's a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest.810 in my opinion.".

The only problem is it came out when superhero movies were just getting started. Had this been released in 2009 instead of 1999 after XMen SpiderMan Superman Returns and Iron Man all came out audiences would have gone crazy over this lovable group of wannabe superheroes who have to save the day when real superhero Captain Amazing is captured.Certainly few movies boast a murder's row of actors such as this movie did. William H. Macy was hysterical as family man The Shoveler Hank Azaria's Blue Raja was a master of throwing forks never knives Janeane Garofalo back when she was likable was The Bowler Kel Mitchell as Invisible Boy who can only turn invisible if no one is watching and even Paul Pee Wee Herman Reubens was a riot as The Spleen who took passing gas to a whole new level.The ringleader of the group is Mr. Furious Ben Stiller who seems to become the focal point of the movie more than anyone else. I thought it a bit ironic Stiller would trash this film given most of the scenes that annoyed me involved him although he does redeem his role by movie's end.The group of supervillians is impressive as well led by Geoffrey Rush as Casanova Frankenstein and Eddie Izzard and Pras as the two Tonys. Even Captain Amazing Greg Kinnear isn't much in the way of a superhero to the Mystery Men given how condescending he acts towards them and how full of himself he is. Kinnear did provide a great performance there no question.If you're a fan of what Marvel is putting out these days this movie will make you laugh and cheer for the good guys.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure what compelled Fredric March and Florence Eldridge to do this British film for J. Arthur Rank based on the life of Christopher Columbus. Or at least an interpretation of that life as come down in popular culture. It didn't add much to either of their reputations but I suppose did no harm.March is in the title role of the intrepid Genoese sea captain who is credited with the discovery of America. By America of course we mean the western hemisphere and not the USA. Columbus never did make it in any of his four voyages to the lower 48. One thing that is a weakness of this film for American audiences is that this it is not made clear that King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella were joint rulers she was not just a consort Queen. Earlier in Spanish history Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile married and that marriage unified Spain as a nation. But both were monarchs in their own right. It's clear to me but I fear not to others as to why Florence Eldridge as Queen Isabella can in fact act independently as she does. Francis L. Sullivan is Count Bobadilla who became Columbus's enemy at court and he plays it in the grand and florid Sullivan manner. He's always a joy to watch in any film no matter how good or bad it is.The greatness of Columbus lies in two things the fact that he had an idea about sailing west in an effort to find a shorter route for trade with the Orient. He was in fact wrong as you can be on that score. He based his calculations on the fact that he thought the earth much smaller than it really was. But he persisted and eventually sold the notion to the Castilian Queen.Secondly though whatever else he was Columbus was one incredibly good sea captain. In a voyage into unknown territory he kept his crew together for about two months until land was sighted in what is now the Bahamas. The film itself has quite a few dry patches. It's dull retelling of an exciting adventure. For their time the special effects are good but are pretty dated now. It's obvious the Nina Pinta and Santa Maria are all models in a tank.A couple of films were done in time for the 500 anniversary of the first voyage that were more accurate in the detail. You probably are better off seeing either of them.".

Why is it March always seemed too old for all of his major roles beginning with ANTHONY ADVERSE.This is a very respectable version of the Columbus story but a bit plodding and dull when it should come to life with more vigor. There's an almost textbook quality about the script that takes fortyfive minutes to set Columbus on his voyage after much confrontational verbal exercises at the Spanish court with Queen Isabella FLORENCE ELDRIDGE and FRANCIS L. SULLIVAN as a nobleman who opposes the voyage. Strangely enough this portion of the film is the most interesting.Production values are splendid but there's a muted quality to the color of the TCM print I viewed. FREDRIC MARCH is competent in the title role but never quite assumes the mantle of the courageous and determined leader of men with his daring new ideas. It's easy to see why his crewmen become skeptical and suspicious midway during the voyage. Their growing doubts are understandable after so many days at sea.Summing up Interesting enough but would have been a more successful film with a more vital performer in the title role rather than the uninspired portrayal of its tired looking leading man whose work here is rather pallid.For all the attempts to bring it to life it remains a flat version rather than a fully rounded one.".

In addition the films also perpetuate mythstories often retold so many times people just assume it to be true. THe sad fact is that we have no idea what he looked like and aren't even positive about where he was born. When the film begins it says that during Columbus' time people assumed the world was flatsomething practically no sane person at the time thought! They could see that the Earth had a curved horizon and the reason few traveled across the Atlantic had to do with a previous lack of navigational tools as well as it being completely unknown. People just did NOT think they'd fall off the worlda myth perpetuated by a mostly fictional history book by Washington Irving that purported to be a biography of the man.Today we are in an age of deconstruction of Columbus. Whereas in 1949 he was practically depicted as superhuman today he's seen as a genocidal maniac. Neither depiction is quite correct. There is a lot to admire as well as dislike about the manand it's a darn shame that no film I know of even tries to give a balanced account of what we know about this skilled sailor.So why then did I watch this film? Well I like Frederic March and think he's a bit underrated as an actor. Even a secondrate film which this clearly is with March is worth watching. There are some nice qualities about the filmthe costumes and sets are reasonably accurate. As for the acting it is a bit stilted and dull. Perhaps they talked this way back then I am no expert on this but the people seemed a bit too constricted and formal throughout. There were a few exceptionsthe jolly fat guy was pretty cool. But even with a few decent performances nothing can change the fact that the film is wildly inaccurate and rather dull. Plus it perpetuates the idea that Columbus discovered Americaomitting the fact that natives had discovered it first and the Vikings had been there several centuries earlier. Of course there are several other possible expeditions that MIGHT have made it there before Columbus as well but there just isn't enough space here to discuss the recent Chinese claim or other ideas that most likely will never be proved.By the way the print shown on Turner Classic Movies is strongly sepiatoned.

First Frederic March's 1940's typical American Joe accent is priceless. Just picture Joe Biden playing Columbus. Did they even have casting directors back then? The filmmakers also take copious liberties with the story my favorite one being that they paint Columbus as this maverick who sasses the Spanish court judges commissioned to approve or deny his voyage. He was this close to lighting a cigarette popping his collar hopping on a motorcycle and riding into the sunset. I could go on and on but you get the drift.

	schema:reviewBody "It is very odd that this prestigious 1949 Technicolor production should emanate from Britain  dealing as it does with the Italian explorer who discovered America a nation which had to fight the very British monarchy to attain its independence! Perhaps it was bankrolled as a token of appreciation towards the U.S. for having joined the Allied Forces in WWII if so I cannot say that it was particularly appreciated at the time as it was a resounding boxoffice flop. In fact the film is often dismissed as a tedious costumer but while no classic for sure I found it to be a wellcrafted and engrossing picture buoyed by a good cast and fine production values.Since Columbus was 41 when he set sail for The New World the casting of 52year old Fredric March to portray him here may seem to have been a strange choice indeed he is fitted with a most unbecoming whitehaired wig for the film's entire duration but one cannot deny the fact that he gives the role his utmost in stature and dignity  after all Columbus was firstly an inspired cartographer then a swaggering adventurer. Indeed March's reallife wife Florence Eldridge is also present here as Queen Isabella of Spain who after the initial but longwinded skepticism lends a sympathetic ear to Columbus' pleas for funding his exploratory marine enterprise though what ultimately propels this is pure movie fabrication!. The rest of the cast list is peppered with familiar faces from postWWII British cinema Francis L. Sullivan and Linden Travers as Columbus' major opponent in the Spanish court and his attractive scandalous cousin who tries to ensnare the former Derek Bond and Niall McGinnis as Columbus' companion and navigator  his major allies during his tumultuous sea voyage Felix Aylmer and Abraham Sofaer as the Queen's former confessor and Chancellor  Columbus' first champions who were instrumental in obtaining him royal favour James Robertson Justice and Edward Rigby as the ambitious and ultimately treacherous Captain Pinzon and a perennially grumpy mutineering sailor.Needless to say the producers' aim here was less to instruct than to entertain and as such it may seem surprising today to find that half of the film's relatively trim 104minute length is spent in court intrigues that dissipate Columbus' energy but not his spirit. The initial sea voyage that almost ended in mutiny and failure takes up the next quarter of the film while the arrival on land the meeting with and subsequent colonization of the natives Columbus' first triumphant return to Spain and his disgraceful second one in chains at the behest of incoming governor Sullivan and eventual disillusionment and abandonment by the Spanish crown are crammed into the last quarter of an hour! Although the TCMsourced print which cut off rather too abruptly during the end credits! I watched was hardly pristine with the colour looking especially insipid I still managed to enjoy Stephen Dade's cinematography and Arthur Bliss' rousing score.For the record this is the fifth movie about the Italian explorer I have gotten under my belt following the starstudded eponymous 1985 partlyshotinMalta Italian TV miniseries and the 3 disparate but simultaneous cinematic renditions made in time for the 500th anniversary of the historical event George Pan Cosmatos' CHRISTOPER COLUMBUS THE DISCOVERY also partly shot on our shores Ridley Scott's 1492 THE CONQUEST OF PARADISE and the spoof CARRY ON COLUMBUS a oneoff revival of the popular comedy franchise. Apparently Anthony Dexter also played him in Irwin Allen's infamous historical charade THE STORY OF MANKIND 1957 and I also have a fourpart Italian TV miniseries from 1968 directed by Vittorio Cottafavi and starring Spanish actor Francisco Rabal in my unwatched pile.".

Don't get me wrong ripoff's are fine as far as I'm concerned but when you butcher the original script which was no polished pearl either truth be told in such a brutal and merciless way that's just wrong.I think the acting is actually sometimes even done better here in Croatia just as the camerawork Croatia is renowned for awful quality of both camera and script not to mention acting mind you and the voiceovers yes voiceovers! are done just as bad.The whole movie gives you the impression of being made from top to bottom in a 100 square foot radius the scenes are done in one and the same place over and over again only the angle changes a bit a prop or two is added and occasionally smoke... and the costumes... my god the costumes.I won't go into further detail here as this was an absolute disaster of a film and while it would get a 9 out of 10 on my funometer the objective grade here is 2 and I'm being generous.If you're looking for an action flick or anything to do with SciFi don't see this. If you enjoy a good trash movie like I do and had fun watching Leben Tod  Night of the Dead 2006 a mustsee for trash lovers this deserves to be on your towatch list.Cheers!".

	schema:reviewBody "If you have seen the promotional poster for this movie then you might think that this has something to do with the highly successful Alien franchise or maybe the sequel to Alien vs Predator. Unfortunately it's neither. After the first 10 minutes I was hoping it might be a spoof or parody of the Alien movies. Sadly it's not that either. Although it is rather unintentionally funny.The story revolves around two spaceships that crash land on Earth. One contains a menacing alien and the other an alien hunter that is hunting the alien. Both spaceships land in the vicinity of a small country town where Marty William Katt a local newspaper reporter  and wannabe Pulitzer Prize writer  resides. After witnessing an alien attack firsthand Marty tries to inform the townsfolk of what he saw and they all go to investigate further but eventually find themselves caught up in the hunt. I won't comment any further on the plot line but if you have seen any of the Alien or Predator movies then you can probably guess the rest.The alien looks a little similar to those seen in the Alien movies but the it has a body of a spider. Due to the rather lackluster special effects in this movie the alien doesn't look anywhere near as menacing as those seen in the Alien movies. The alien hunter looks like a cross between the Iron Giant and the robot from Lost in Space the old 60s TV show. And I am making it sound a lot better than what it really is.This is a strictly straighttovideo movie that will probably get more attention for its cover poster than anything else. It was sad to see William Katt in this movie. I used to like him in the 80s TV show The Greatest American Hero and even the House horror films but he really seems miscast in this dud. All the actors are terribly bad probably due to a dire script. There is also some terrible editing but I have a feeling this was done to hide the atrocious special effects and poor action scenes.I would categorize this movie in the same class as Scorpius Gigantus 2006 Species III Set Invasion 2004 and Starship Troopers 2 Hero Of The Federation 2004. All straighttovideo duds with lame special effects poor editing and terrible acting. Don't waste your time...".

The hunter looks like a robot with a Chinese hat and seems to be a cheap looking clone of the predator. The acting is really bad and the characters are all stereotypes of typical characters like the aging hero the woman who secretly likes him the military gun freak and many more. Any scene that's supposed to be dramatic has a blue colored lens to make it seem scary I guess or a reddish colored lens and it looks stupid.

Since the Alien vs. Predator sequel is set in a small American town Alien vs. Hunter is set in a small American town. After some helicopter shots we're treated to a middleaged man jogging completely oblivious to a huge smoking object crashing behind him. From there we are introduced to an alien and a hunter and people die and run around and shoot at stuff.This particular effort is punctuated by some nice derivative designs. The alien resembles Giger's Alien except for the whole spider thing and the hunter is a safe reimagining of the Predator. In this respect The Asylum have really outdone themselves. This kind of production design could really have helped them on movies like Alien Abduction. A couple scenes particularly the tunnel scene make pretty good use of lighting and the wide aspect ratio. This scene suitably rips off Alien 3.The characters are a real low point though. Our heroes have a few very superficial clichs that pass for character and they are played off one another in a way that makes you wish the monsters would win. There is some solace in watching people get killed off but it was never the ones I really wanted dead. My favorite line is Guys we're on the ship and that totally sucks.I'm almost used to these quirks by now even the worst one of never quite getting everything in frame. It's odd watching these because the little flashes of competence give you the feeling that it would have been a solid movie if only they bothered to get the coverage. But down to brass tax this thing advertises itself on its special effects and there really isn't anything wrong with those. Plus the film wisely avoids much reference to Alien vs. Predator and instead liberally rips off the original Alien Predator and Aliens.Without giving anything away I do have to say the final twist is really irritating. Apart from this Alien vs. Hunter is an essential for any fan of The Asylum.".

It's not that the movie is confusing by any means like when a complicated movie gets edited too much and loses its meaning although it does seem that editing is at least part of the problem. There are plot holes left and right and I constantly found myself wondering why the characters acted as they did. Sometimes you could chalk it up to the typical girl runs upstairs to avoid murderer nonsense used to draw the plot along but other times it just seemed to be random events strung together. It would be like watching a movie where a guy is running from a monster towards an abandoned hospital then the monster is chasing him through a house of mirrors at a fun house.And now my brain hurts from trying to think about the movie. Go see it if you want your brain to hurt.".

This movie gives me the impression that the company Global Asylum is just that a mental health asylum as the producers of this movie are out of their minds thinking that today's movie public is going to be thrilled to see this. From what I saw of this movie the script is horrible and there are sequences that just do not fit together.

No stupid he's lying out here in country side next to a wrecked car taking a nap..Enough said.. See it for yourself or take my advice... DON'T".

	schema:reviewBody "AVH Alien vs. Hunter is set in some small rural American town where Lee William Katt works as a newspaper reporter while out jogging two large unidentified objects crash land nearby. Sheriff Joel Armstrong Collin Brock is on his way to investigate  picks Lee up just in case he might be of any use when they get to the crash site they find a spaceship sticking out of the ground  it's slimy half Spider half mutant alien occupant running around outside the Spider like alien kills Sheriff Armstrong while Lee  local teenager Tammy Wittly Jourdan manage to drive off  escape. The rest of the town about four people find it hard to believe Lee  Tammy's tales about alien monsters but after a quick trip out there are suitably convinced when it kills newspaper editor Marcy Darbi Gwynn. The survivors feel their best chance is to head for military dude Valentine's Randy Mulkey house where he has lots of guns  radio equipment but with a killer alien running around nowhere is safe...Directed by Scott Harper  brought to us by those folk at The Asylum this is yet another shameless ripoff cashin of another big budget much publicised Hollywood flick in this very obvious instance it's AVP Alien vs. Predator 2004  it's sequel AVPR Alien vs. Predator  Requiem 2007 which have their name tarnished by this abysmal excuse for a film. I honestly don't quite know where to begin in order to get across just how bad just how awful  just what a miserable experience it is watching AVH Alien vs. Hunter. For a start it is a complete ripoff of AVP Alien vs. Predator there's the nasty slimy alien with an elongated head  sharp fangs that kill humans on sight  there's the hunter alien who wears body armours  has various weapons including the ability to turn invisible however the general concept  stealing of ideas is where the comparisons end. Basically AVH Alien vs. Hunter is set in a town which seems to consist of about six people yet it has it's own newspaper with reporter  editor a complex underground passageway of sewers  it's own police department. Various other character's are spoken about but never seen Tammy's mother that fat bloke's wife  I assume they became alien food. The pacing is terrible the entire film feels like amateur actor's running through some woods trying to look scared when the alien pops up for a bit of variety there are also some shots of these people running sewer passages trying to look scared when the alien turns up. At one point three of them randomly enter one of the spaceship's I don't how but they do. Despite being able to build  pilot a spaceship the slimy alien seems to have no intelligence while the hunter alien just sort of walks about a bout  fires his puny little laser off a few times  misses with every shot. The character's are all stupid while watching AVH Alien vs. Hunter I couldn't work out what their plan was why didn't they get in a car  just get away as fast as possible? Why walk through the open woods to get to Valentine's? Were they going to stay  fight or then make a run for it? There never seemed to be any clear plan of action here the character's just randomly  pointlessly wander around these woods  sewers until some genius suggest they trap the alien in an open field! I mean how do you 'trap' something in an open field? Surely the fact that the field is described as 'open' means it's not the best place to try  trap something right? Then there's a baffling twist ending the ending in which this futuristic alien hunter takes off his welder's mask  has a beer  cigarette what? Did I miss something? He was human? Weren't we on Earth? What the hell? At least he still kept that huge salad bowl on his head. One of the worst films ever made  surely a candidate for the worst film made by The Asylum which is a scary thought.As expected the CGI computer effects are terrible the shots of the Spider alien thing are awful as it just glides across the screen without moving it's legs as The Asylum probably couldn't afford to animate the wretched thing. The alien hunter fares little better with a puny little laser that goes 'pew pew' every so often the costume it wears looks like a left over reject from a particularly bad Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers episode. Most of the film is set in a wood somewhere  has rock bottom production values with awful looking futuristic guns bad sound effects  terrible setpieces that offer no excitement gore or action  are so dull  flatly filmed it's frightening. You know what? I don't even want to think about this boring eyesore of a film anymore.With a supposed budget of about 500000 all I can say is where did the money go? AVH Alien vs. Hunter looks like it was on a camcorder edited on a PC with public domain special effect programs used for the CGI. Terrible music terrible editing terrible special effects terrible production values  terrible acting with William Katt  Dedee Pfeiffer really slumming it here they must have been desperate for rent money to make this crap.AVH Alien vs. Hunter is one of the worst films ever made really you have to see it to believe just how amazingly bad it actually is. I honestly can't think of one good thing to say about this tripe avoid at all cost's!".

The Hunter looked like something out of the halo games and the alien had a very similar head shape to the original Alien 1979.

I mean were they even trying to make it good? And did they actually care if this movie was going to be good?And i mean what were they thinking? This movie is just plain awful.Don't watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched Alien vs. hunter and for what it's worth I liked it. No it didn't have a 20 million dollar budget but you can tell the actors were really trying to make the best of it. I liked the special effects. Anyone I mean anyone can make a bad movie with enough money thrown at it. For example I just watched Hot Rod. It is probably the worst film I've ever seen. On the other hand Alien vs. Hunter is better and that says a lot considering that one had a huge budget and the other didn't. I am a filmmaker and am working on the editing of my project titled Predator World Terra Firma. I'm using a Sony HDR SR1 and a HC1 1440x1080i. I would like to recommend the following to the director and DITDP. Use a blue tooth wireless microphone. It is amazing at 5.1 Dolby surround sound and a 100foot crystal clear audio range. You can purchase a SR1 online now for 400.00 and just use it for sound if you have a HVX200 or Z1U etc. Also have more cut away shots so the scenes aren't as choppy. Switch camera angles on the main characters so that the audience can anticipate drama. One item on set that is really worth it is a boom arm. Not to forget the NTSC disc I got at Blockbuster has a red color shift. Hence I think you guys used HDV. I like to take away some red range of color by using gels or just use scrims. If I don't have a lot of time on set try using GE REVEAL LIGHTS Home Depot. Yes it is like a sunset effect but when you adjust the red out you can get a great skin tone that transfers to NTSC from HDV or AVHCD. If you hate generator noise go to Costco and buy a portable 400watt generator for 79.00. It can run a few lights for several hours and weighs 30lbs. No noise. Lastly shoot in Arizona for your next project. Need tactical gear and troops? We also have much better landscapes than California and the department of taxation will give you big breaksrefunds. Need actors and crew to shoot in AZ? I can arrange it.

The alien is this spider creature..a really cheap failure quite a groanerthat runs around looking for prey and it's eye sight..there's often a dependency on pointofview is this strange green lens the filmmakers put over their camera lens. Katt is a reporter who was just out jogging when a deputy picks him up to investigate a call discovering a damaged space craft which landed.

A small militia join up with a very distraught Katt hoping their human artillery can stand a chance against the dangerous hunter and the predatory alien spider monster. Dee Dee isn't bad to look at for the running time but she's about all Alien Vs Hunter has going for it. There are a lot of awkward character exchanges and some really offthecuff dialogue not to mention the acting is suspect..really what can a cast do with such material?. It seems that Katt and Dee Dee knew what kind of movie they were stuck in toying..toiling might be a better word around with some of the dialogue..though in my opinion a lot of the dialogue looks adlibbed. What gore is present is ineffective but the computer effects for the alien spider are just a major drag. The hunter has your basic special forces suit with extra bells and whistles to make it look futuristic. Just rent the real deal with far superior visual effects and skip this ludicrous trifling scifi trough of cinematic waste.".

Next you know he is getting another cast member killed off in the sewars tunnels.People insist it is a bear attacking even though they have seen a giant spider creature. After all we all know about those 8 legged bears.

The dialog is stereotypical and pointless. Then there is the disgruntle local hunter who has a grudge against Katt's character for writing a bad review about him.

	schema:reviewBody "THE FBI STORY 1959 was Warner Bros. 149 minute epic tribute to the famous criminal investigation agency! From a book by Don Whitehead came a somewhat laborious screenplay by Richard L. Green and John Twist and was directed with only a modicum of flair by Mervyn LeRoy. However it did have splendid colour Cinematography by Joseph Biroc and a helpful score by the studio's musical magician Max Steiner!The movie charts the history of the Bureau from its lowly beginnings in the twenties to modern times and its all seen through the recollections of aging fastidious agent Chip Hardesty James Stewart as he relates his investigative experiences  in flashback  to a class of budding young agents. But it's all very longwinded and episodic! And as it progresses it begins to look like a TV mini series instead of a major movie production as the young Hardesty runs the American crime gamut from taking on such notorious criminal figures as Baby Face Nelson Ma Barker Dillinger etc. to sorting out nefarious organisations like the Ku Klux Klan Nazi spy rings and the Red Menace. And here it has to be said that only for the screen presence and appeal of its star THE FBI STORY would probably have ended up a forgotten disaster. Moreover this is another problem with the picture  Stewart is left to carry the entire movie almost on his own! With the exception of Vera Miles  who has the thankless role of being his long suffering but devoted wife  he is surrounded by a cast of minor players! Throughout you find yourself half expecting someone like Robert Ryan Jack Palance or even Raymond Burr to make a welcome entrance as a mobster or a police chief or whatever. But nothing quite as imaginative as that ever occurs! Pity!The film does however manage to give a good look inside the workings of the Bureau! With the help of Stewart's narration we learn about the thousands of men and women who work for the organisation which includes the hundreds of agents in the field. And we are also treated to a peek inside headquarters which houses the gigantic records section and we also get a glimpse of the chemists and fingerprint experts meticulously going through their daily chores.Another plus for the movie is Max Steiner's remarkable score! Heard over the titles is a powerful rousing and determined march while for the picture's gentler moments there is an attractive love theme. But quite ingenious is the menacing and ominous march theme for the Ku Klux Klan sequence. And better still is the rhythmic LatinAmerican music the composer wrote for the South American scenes especially the exciting Fandango like orchestrations for the arrival of the Federal troops on horseback. THE FBI STORY was one of five scores the composer wrote in 1959 which included Samuel Bronston's naval epic John Paul Jones the charming Romcom Cash McCall Delmer Daves' seminal western The Hanging Tree and Daves' A Summer Place from which derived the Young Love Theme  which was to become a major hit tune for Steiner better known as Theme From A Summer Place.THE FBI STORY just about passes muster as a movie thanks to Biroc's rich colour Cinematography Steiner's wonderful music and of course Jimmie Stewart who makes anything watchable!Classic but implausible line from THE FBI STORY............. As the bland Nick Adams who has just blown up a plane with 43 people on board including his mother is being led away handcuffed he turns to the arresting officer and blurts In case I get any mail you can send it to Canyon City prison for the next month or so  after that you can send it to HELL. Wow!".

The parts dealing with Jimmy's domestic life not so much. Vera Miles is very attractive as a blonde and plays the clichd but likable wife role well. It's just this part of the movie isn't that interesting and takes up too much time in a movie that goes on for over two hours. Murray Hamilton is good as Jimmy's partner I never want to cool off! NEVER!. If your blood boils about J. Edgar Hoover or you demand absolute historical accuracy from any film depicting real people and events you'll hate this. But if you like Jimmy Stewart you'll certainly find things to enjoy here. He's really the whole show.

Edgar Hoover.While Hoover is often referenced sometimes heard and even briefly seen at his desk Buddhalike the focus here is on fictional FBI agent Chip Hardesty James Stewart who dedicates himself to serving the bureau through decades of crimefighting heroics. Whether ambushing John Dillinger or rounding up the Ku Klux Klan Hardesty provides a case example of the heroism from which the FBI was made.The final words of the film superimposed on the screen over triumphant fanfare establish what The FBI Story is all about Our sincere thanks to the FBI and J. Edgar Hoover not only for their guidance and active participation in the making of this motion picture but also for making this world of ours a safer place in which to live...If they had saved this boilerplate for the end The FBI Story might have had a chance. Stewart was one of the greats and in Vera Miles as the love interest he enjoys steady support. Few color films from the 1950s are this crisp and dynamiclooking. Director Mervyn LeRoy was famously good at his job and manages some stellar framing work with an eye for period detail in the episodic sequences showing Hardesty on the job at various stages of the FBI's existence.But the accent of this film is not on delivering quality entertainment but burnishing Director Hoover's ego. At every turn we get our noses rubbed into how brilliant an organization he set up to the point where suspense gets crushed before it has a chance to develop.An opening sequence features Nick Adams as a young man named Graham who kills his mother and 48 other people on board a plane by putting a bomb inside her luggage. Immediately we see FBI agents questioning him and searching his house until he cracks and confesses even yelling at the end to send his mail to hell.Jack Graham's only mistake was that he was absentminded Stewart tells us in a voiceover. He forgot about the broad research powers of the FBI.Elsewhere we get lengthy descriptions of what these powers are and even footage of people typing or staring into microscopes at FBI headquarters.The dialogue in this film is much too purple as if competing for your attention with Max Steiner's bombastic score. There are some howlers other reviewers here pointed out my favorite is when Miles gets cross when she finds out her husband is going out armed to take on some public enemies. He tells her to take it easy.You take it easy Chip! I don't look good in black.Murray Hamilton has his own overthetop moments as Chip's FBI buddy all charged up with Hoover in charge. I never wanna cool down he says. No worries a breathless script by Richard L. Breen and John Twist won't let him until it's time to stop and smell the lilacs.There's one solid sequence where Hardesty investigates the murders of Osage Indians in Oklahoma. That works as a crime story with some mystery and humor to it not to mention a satisfying wrapper.The rest of the time it's like some jackedup medley of J. Edgar's greatest hits like taking down bank robbers and a Soviet spy ring. Much padding involves Hardesty's family affairs like his search for missing tissue paper or a crisis involving a shattered dish of pickles. Even when the script tries to drum up a crisis between Hardesty and his wife the result is unconvincing and muchtooeasily resolved.That goes for most everything else involving The FBI Story rich in visual style but cheap in too many other departments including the kind of patriotism too often used as the refuge of scoundrels. I do admire J. Edgar Hoover in some areas but when it came to making movies he should have stayed in the closet.".

	schema:reviewBody "The FBI Story tries to tell the story of the evolution of the FBI over 35 years through the eyes of a veteran agent Chip Hardesty James Stewart. It spins off into several segments covering Hardesty's career. There's a segment on the Klu Klux Klan with nary an African American in sight one showing the cheating of native Americans out of their oil leases in Texas and several brief runins with the well known gangsters of the 1930s.Inrerspersed with these episodes are home life interludes where Stewart's character turns into George Bailey Its a Wonderful Life 1946. He meets and marries Lucy Vera Miles and we follow their lives through the birth of three children a miscarriage a separation and a war time tragedy.Told in a documentary style this film in my opinion is far too long at 149 minutes. The action sequences such as they are are brief and with no character development of the gangsters. They are simply confronted by the FBI and either arrested or gunned down. The Hardesty character is hardly involved in these segments and he does not confront any of the gangsters directly.The at home sequences while well played look like something out of Father Knows Best the popular TV series of the day. Another thing I found unusual was the fact that Stewart and Miles basically carry the whole film. Other characters appear briefly then either get killed off or disappear altogether. While Stewart and Miles do their best they hardly seem to have aged 35 years over the course of the story. And there are no name actors to speak of in the supporting cast. Murray Hamilton Larry Pennell and Nick Adams do appear briefly but were not that well known in 1959.James Cagney's GMen 1935 covered the FBI's early years much better.".

Edgar Hoover personally approved and had a cameo role in the production. James Stewart is excellent as usual and the supporting cast except for the talentless Vera Miles is good.  Murray Hamilton is especially good in a supporting role as Stewart's partner and best friend.  The FBI accomplishments that the film highlights are undoubtedly all true.  What is significant is what it leaves out.One of the most shameful parts of the film is the depiction of the killing of John Dillinger.  It is portrayed pretty much as it happened but no mention at all is made of Melvin Purvis the Chicago Bureau Chief who headed the operation.  Instead the operation is depicted as if the fictional Chip Hardesty were running it.  It has been said that Hoover was jealous of the publicity that Purvis received after Dillinger was killed Purvis was subsequently transferred to a remote outpost and shortly afterward left the FBI.  This is no doubt why Purvis was never mentioned in the film.  But this viewer at least paused to think that if Purvis was treated this way what about all the agents who conducted all the other operations depicted in the film.  Were they also completely ignored and replaced by the fictional Hardesty.The film is probably accurate in its portrayal of FBI activity up through the end of WWII.  However after that point the film would have us believe that the only threat facing the US came from international communism which is no doubt what Hoover believed.  Never mind the Mafia.  Never mind the lynchings that were still going on in the South.  Never mind that blacks were being intimidated to keep them from voting in much of the South.  I don't know if the FBI had started wiretapping Martin Luther King by the time this film was made but if not it wasn't very long afterward that it started.As I said at the outset this is pretty good entertainment but it should be viewed as the sanitized fictionalization that it is.".

	schema:headline " The FBI For Richer Or Poorer";
	schema:reviewBody "In the tradition of GMen The House On 92nd Street The Street With No Name now comes The FBI Story one of those carefully supervised films that showed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the best possible light. While it's 48 year director J. Edgar Hoover was alive it would be showed in no other kind of light.The book by Don Whitehead that this film is based on is a straight forward history of the bureau from it's founding in 1907 until roughly the time the film The FBI Story came out. It's important sometimes to remember there WAS an FBI before J. Edgar Hoover headed it. Some of that time is covered in the film as well.But Warner Brothers was not making a documentary so to give the FBI flesh and blood the fictional character of John 'Chip' Hardesty was created. Hardesty as played by James Stewart is a career FBI man who graduated law school and rather than go in practice took a job with the bureau in the early twenties.In real life the Bureau was headed by William J. Burns of the Burns Private Detective Agency. It was in fact a grossly political operation then as is showed in the film. Burns was on the periphery of the scandals of the Harding administration. When Hoover was appointed in 1924 to bring professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous standards of competence in he did just that. Through the Hardesty family which is Stewart and wife Vera Miles we see the history of the FBI unfold. In addition we see a lot of their personal family history which is completely integrated into the FBI's story itself. Stewart and Miles are most assuredly an all American couple. We follow the FBI through some of the cases Stewart is involved with arresting Ku Klux Klan members a plot to murder oil rich Indians bringing down the notorious criminals of the thirties their involvement with apprehending Nazi sympathizers in World War II and against Communist espionage in the Cold War.There is a kind of prologue portion where Stewart tells a class at the FBI Academy before going into the history of the bureau as it intertwines with his own. That involves a bomb placed on an airline by a son who purchased a lot of life insurance on his mother before the flight. Nick Adams will give you the creeps as the perpetrator and the story is sadly relevant today.Of course if The FBI Story were written and produced today it would reflect something different and not so all American. Still the FBI does have a story to tell and it is by no means a negative one.The FBI Story is not one of Jimmy Stewart's best films but it's the first one I ever saw with my favorite actor in it so it has a special fondness for me. If the whole FBI were made up Jimmy Stewarts I'd feel a lot better about it. There's also a good performance by Murray Hamilton as his friend and fellow agent who is killed in a shootout with Baby Face Nelson.Vera Miles didn't just marry Stewart she in fact married the FBI as the film demonstrates. It's dated mostly but still has a good and interesting story to tell.".

	onyx:emotionText "In the tradition of GMen The House On 92nd Street The Street With No Name now comes The FBI Story one of those carefully supervised films that showed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the best possible light. While it's 48 year director J. Edgar Hoover was alive it would be showed in no other kind of light.The book by Don Whitehead that this film is based on is a straight forward history of the bureau from it's founding in 1907 until roughly the time the film The FBI Story came out. It's important sometimes to remember there WAS an FBI before J. Edgar Hoover headed it. Some of that time is covered in the film as well.But Warner Brothers was not making a documentary so to give the FBI flesh and blood the fictional character of John 'Chip' Hardesty was created. Hardesty as played by James Stewart is a career FBI man who graduated law school and rather than go in practice took a job with the bureau in the early twenties.In real life the Bureau was headed by William J. Burns of the Burns Private Detective Agency. It was in fact a grossly political operation then as is showed in the film. Burns was on the periphery of the scandals of the Harding administration. When Hoover was appointed in 1924 to bring professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous standards of competence in he did just that. Through the Hardesty family which is Stewart and wife Vera Miles we see the history of the FBI unfold. In addition we see a lot of their personal family history which is completely integrated into the FBI's story itself. Stewart and Miles are most assuredly an all American couple. We follow the FBI through some of the cases Stewart is involved with arresting Ku Klux Klan members a plot to murder oil rich Indians bringing down the notorious criminals of the thirties their involvement with apprehending Nazi sympathizers in World War II and against Communist espionage in the Cold War.There is a kind of prologue portion where Stewart tells a class at the FBI Academy before going into the history of the bureau as it intertwines with his own.

Of course in 1959 we did not know about Mr. Hoover's obsession for keeping secret files on honest Americans bugging people like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr but worst of allhis secret love affair with his deputy directorClyde Tolson If you want to know more about that subject I suggest seeing the film Citizen Cohn. Hoover aside This story of a life in the FBI as told by Jimmy Stewart makes for a decent but dated film. Vera Miles as his devoted wife is also good. But Jimmy is the movie. As much as Hoover controlled production and always made sure the FBI was seen without fault Jimmy Stewart gave the film a human sidequite an achievement considering Hoover was always looking over his shoulder. The background score is also pleasant. I have read recent online articles suggesting that this is a forgotten film.

We see the FBI cracking down on the KKK anti Native Americans the Communists spies etc. Some of those parts are exciting but nothing like when it came out almost 50 years ago.

It's a good story with some nice action scenes light touches of family humor and a fine music score by Max Steiner. And yet this twoandahalfhour movie really drags at times. Nonetheless Stewart turns in a very good performance not only onscreen but also via voiceover narration.The most memorable scenes in The FBI Story include the following don't read any further if you have not seen this film. Most of Chip's domestic scenes interwoven between his various FBI cases are aggravating and interfere with the pace of the movie but one of these scenes is very funny as Chip carries on about something as trivial as missing tissue paper. Among the numerous settings required for this picture perhaps the most interesting one is the South American jungle where Chip and his soninlaw George Crandall Larry Pennell work together on a case involving German espionage agents. The Ku Klux Klan invades a newspaper editor's office destroys it and threatens to kill the editor Chip and his fellow agent Sam Crandall Murray Hamilton who is George's father arrive just in time to foil their plan. At the marine base in Quantico VA the young FBI recruits are introduced to Hogan's Alley a series of storefronts with blackandwhite cardboard photos of some famous criminals which pop out from behind various windows and doorways the somewhat inept George Crandall walks down this alley having only a split second to decide whether to fire at these criminals as they emerge one by one and he fails miserably. The Hardestys' celebration of their daughter Anne's Joyce Taylor and George's first wedding anniversary complete with a short piano rendition of Jeepers Creepers and a lengthy vocalization of Oh! You Beautiful Doll is interrupted with the news of young Michael Hardesty Buzz Martin being killed in action at Iwo Jima during World War II. A decade after this movie was made James Stewart himself grieved the loss of one of his stepsons in the Vietnam War. The FBI Story might be a respectable movie in terms of showcasing the Bureau but it sure is plodding. James Stewart being the professional that he was treated it as if it were the greatest project he ever tackled even though it wasn't. I believe we can all learn something from that as J. Edgar Hoover himself acknowledges in his brief address to a small group of agents no matter how unpropitious the job is our best effort is its own reward.".

	schema:reviewBody "After resolving a case related to an explosion of an airplane with fortynine casualties by a swindler using stateofart technique the experienced agent Chip Hardesty James Stewart gives a lecture at FBI Headquarter in Washington. He tells the story of the agency entwined with his own personal life since 1924 when FBI was a bureaucratic department that gave employment to god nephews of politicians. Along the years the agency modernizes and faces Ku Klux Klan deaths of Indians enriched with oil the organized crime when the agents are authorized to use weapons for the first time the period of World War II and the Cold War acting as a counterespionage agency. In his personal life he gets married with Lucy Ann Hardesty Vera Miles they have three children he loses his best friend and also agent Sam Crandall Murray Hamilton killed in action his marriage has a crisis due to his dedication to the Bureau his older daughter gets married and he loses his son in World War II.The FBI Story is a dated and disappointing propaganda of the FBI of Mr. J. Edgar Hoover who certainly sponsored this flick. The idea is to show that the omnipotent and powerful FBI is composed by human beings with flaws and family like any other ordinary American person. Chip and Lucy are the typical middleclass American family of the 50's. However this film is bureaucratic and too long and does not bring any emotion to the viewer in spite of the good performance of James Stewart. The greetings in the very end are ridiculous.

	onyx:emotionText "After resolving a case related to an explosion of an airplane with fortynine casualties by a swindler using stateofart technique the experienced agent Chip Hardesty James Stewart gives a lecture at FBI Headquarter in Washington. He tells the story of the agency entwined with his own personal life since 1924 when FBI was a bureaucratic department that gave employment to god nephews of politicians. Along the years the agency modernizes and faces Ku Klux Klan deaths of Indians enriched with oil the organized crime when the agents are authorized to use weapons for the first time the period of World War II and the Cold War acting as a counterespionage agency. In his personal life he gets married with Lucy Ann Hardesty Vera Miles they have three children he loses his best friend and also agent Sam Crandall Murray Hamilton killed in action his marriage has a crisis due to his dedication to the Bureau his older daughter gets married and he loses his son in World War II.The FBI Story is a dated and disappointing propaganda of the FBI of Mr. J. Edgar Hoover who certainly sponsored this flick. The idea is to show that the omnipotent and powerful FBI is composed by human beings with flaws and family like any other ordinary American person. Chip and Lucy are the typical middleclass American family of the 50's. However this film is bureaucratic and too long and does not bring any emotion to the viewer in spite of the good performance of James Stewart. The greetings in the very end are ridiculous. The DVD released in Brazil by Ocean distributor has a total lack of synchronization between sound and image. My vote is five.Title Brazil A Histria do FBI The FBI Story";

I rewound the tape then slowly stepped through that part as the camera pulled back and showed the waiter.

	schema:reviewBody "Have you ever felt like your being watched like someone keeps tabs on every move you make? Well just remember before you decide to break the law the FBI will always be there.  At least that's the feeling you get after watching the gripping but slightly mellow crime drama The FBI story.  It traces the roots of the organization from a small bureau to one of the most modern facilities in the world in 1959 by telling the story through they eyes of one of its agents Chip Hardesty James Stewart.Chip was with the FBI from day one and he gladly puts his job above everything else in the world even occasionally his family.  The FBI Story tracks his life by depicting what he does as an agent and how being one affects his personal life.  The film does a spectacular job of showing what kind of cases the FBI handles and how they handle them.  The audience gets to see Chip stop Ku Klux Klan riots go undercover to solve an Indian murderestate scandal bring fugitives into custody rescue hostages and helped fight in WWII.   He even helped bring Communist spies to justice.Stewart in a vaguely complex performance is stellar as always as the slightly neurotic agent who loves his job maybe a little too much.  One of the best parts about this film is that we get to see the inside workings of both Chip's family life and his job.  We witness him suffer through the death of his best friend and then his son. We also observe his wife having a miscarriage and his marriage having rocky times.  Almost all of his personal problems are caused by love of his job.  Vera Miles gives a spotty performance but it's very convincing none the less.  She was never a brilliant actress but there was always something very attractive and alluring about her.  Well maybe that's just me?  Sadly none of the other performances are worth mentioning but the attentiongrabbing story managed to keep me exceedingly interested.The cinematography of this film was impressive especially the scenes in the South American jungles.  The colors all had a texture that really set the atmosphere of the film.  Perhaps the greatest part of this movie was Mervyn Leroy's fabulous direction.  Every scene was so fluid they just rolled together to tell a brilliant story. It's chock full of ingenious camera shots some with a very Hitchcockian feel.All in all The FBI Story is a spectacular but overlooked film. Clocking in at two and a half hours some viewers might be intimidated but if you get the chance I recommend jumping into this one.  I enjoyed Jimmy Stewart's spectacular performance and the captivating story.".

And of course the nonetoosurprising dose of antiCommunist hysteria which implies that any looking askance at the Bureau's tactics was tantamount to treason. Needless to say there's nothing about Hoover's careerlong blackmail of sitting presidents or the way that they sometimes used him to gather dirt on their enemies or the fact that Hoover's ego was too delicate to allow him to admit that there was this big thing called Organized Crime that he hadn't even tried to get a handle on and ego and incompetence seem far more likely motives for Hoover's nonpursuit of La Cosa Nostra than stories about snaps of J. Edgar in a frock  no one as obsessed with dignity and possessed of so little as Hoover would ever make themselves that vulnerable to ridicule or exposure.The cast does what they can. James Stewart and Vera Miles are always appealing Nick Adams suggests some of the chilly squishiness of the sort of bushleague criminal he was playing and Murray Hamilton is very appealing as the Hero's Best Friend whose main function in the plot is to get killed which he does. Some of Joseph Biroc's photography is subtle and handsome I'm thinking particularly of a scene on the balcony of a seafood restaurant and it's always refreshingly unfussy. Max Steiner's music in the first few minutes which involve the airline bombing has a chill and an edge his stuff rarely did before it settles into bigmovie bombast. Mervyn LeRoy's direction is utterly undistinguished. But then this wasn't so much a movie as it was Hoover's Valentine. To Himself.".

He expresses frustration with the ineffectiveness of the agency but when J. Edgar becomes Director he has a change of heart. Surprise surprise Edgar was actually in the movie so I'm guessing that he had a part in Hardesty's position Hardesty battles Klan members gangsters and Nazi influence in South America as well as counterintelligence efforts at the peak of his career as an FBI SAC Special Agent In Charge of the New York Field Office.It's not a bad film and there are some really classic quotes. There was this one about how sometimes with gangsters you just need a slidefed automatic machine gun. I enjoyed that one a lot. However it did strike me very much as a propaganda film being as though J. Edgar seems like a hero. The film even shows his personal arrest of a gangster making death threats.".

Surprise surprise Edgar was actually in the movie so I'm guessing that he had a part in Hardesty's position Hardesty battles Klan members gangsters and Nazi influence in South America as well as counterintelligence efforts at the peak of his career as an FBI SAC Special Agent In Charge of the New York Field Office.It's not a bad film and there are some really classic quotes. There was this one about how sometimes with gangsters you just need a slidefed automatic machine gun. I enjoyed that one a lot. However it did strike me very much as a propaganda film being as though J. Edgar seems like a hero. The film even shows his personal arrest of a gangster making death threats.";

	schema:reviewBody "Silent film may be the only unique art form ever to have flourished and then become extinct. The great ironyindeed tragedyof its demise is that it reached its peak only in the last few years before the talkie revolution. Silent films from 1927 through 1930 dazzle with their fluid and sophisticated mastery of visual storytelling the last thing they need is dialogue. F.W. Murnau's City Girl is a perfect example of this artistry and what happened to it. The followup to Murnau's legendary masterpiece Sunrise City Girl was made during the waning days of silents and in a concession to the changeover to sound it was recut before its release and given a recorded score featuring singing farmhands. Not surprisingly the hybrid film sank like a stone. Miraculously an original silent print survived and was rediscovered in the vaults at 20th CenturyFox. I first saw it at the National Film Theatre in London during a Murnau retrospective. I'd never heard of it but when I went to see Nosferatu the speaker introducing it added Be sure to come back next week and see City Girlit's better than Sunrise! This claim would be very hard to defend but while lacking the transcendence of Sunrise City Girl is in some ways a more complex and interesting work.It also defends the honor of city girls from the laughably caricatured vamp who causes all the trouble in Sunrise. Like the earlier film City Girl deals with the clash between urban and rural values but here the countryside is no more pure or wholesome than the city. Unlike the vague timeless setting of Sunrise City Girl's milieu is the contemporary American Midwest. Kate Mary Duncan is a waitress in a busy Chicago lunchroom who lives in a dreary tenement and dreams of escaping the city. She meets Lem Charles Farrell a nave and sweetnatured farm boy who has been sent to the city to sell his family's wheat crop. They fall in love marry and set out for the wheatfields. But Kate's dreams are shattered by Lem's harsh tyrannical father David Torrence and she finds herself waiting on rowdy leering farmhands who are even worse than the lunchroom customers. Kate loses faith in Lem when he is unable to stand up to his father and the marriage appears to be over almost before it began until a series of melodramatic events force the various characters to examine their true motives and feelings.Every aspect of this story is expressed through visual details. We are introduced to Lem on the train to Chicago eating handpacked sandwiches oblivious to the flirtations of a vamp across the aisle whose interest is aroused by his bankroll we know right off this isn't going to be Sunrise II. We see Kate sassily quashing passes from customers What do you do in the evenings? YOU'LL never know! and we see her in her dingy little room watering a pathetic dusty flower on the fireescape and listening to a windup mechanical bird while the El rushes past the window. The sweaty chaotic bustle of the lunchroom is captured with tremendous verve. Once the scene moves to the country the symbolism of wheat becomes the heart of the film which Murnau wanted to call Our Daily Bread. In a ravishing scene the newlyweds run through a glistening swirling field of grain when they arrive at the house Lem's little sister greets Kate with a bouquet of wheat stalks. When the dour father enters he rebukes her for wasting their cash crop to him grain only means money. He also notices that Kate has put her cloche hat down on the family bible and he is convinced that she's a floozy who sees Lem as a gravy train.The Torrence brothers David and Ernest specialized in hissable nastiness but here David's worried American Gothic face conveys the hard life that has turned this man into a monster. It's hard to believe he could be genetically linked to a sweetfaced curlyhaired cutie like Charles Farrell but he does make Lem's anguished weakness believable. Mary Duncan is perfect as a feisty yet vulnerable working girl a type that would become much more common in early talkies. Duncan left the screen in 1933 when she married a polo player named Laddie Sanford. She lived to be 98 but her retirement was Hollywood's loss. I would like to see this intelligent natural blackeyed actress in something else.City Girl is marred by an ending that feels rushed and unconvincing but it raises interesting at times troubling themes concerning marriage traditional gender roles and family relationships. The most poignant aspect of this exquisitely directed film is not that it was one of the last silent movies made in Hollywood but that its director would die in a car crash just three years later at the age of fortytwo. That was cinema's loss.".

	schema:reviewBody "Murnau's third American film after Sunrise and the lost Four Devils and his penultimate before Tabu. City Girl of the surviving three is the least seen. The reason for this must be its close resemblance to Sunrise which is a masterpiece of the first order. Yes City Girl does remind one of Sunrise in its mood and focus. A young rube from Minnesota Charles Farrell travels to Chicago to sell his father's wheat crop. Businesswise the trip doesn't go well but his romantic world blossoms when he meets up with a lonely waitress Mary Duncan. The two marry and the rest of the film deals with Duncan's fight for acceptance on the farm where she faces a fierce opponent in her fatherinlaw David Torrence. The film is romantic emotionally moving and utterly beautiful. Yes it is a lot like Sunrise but heck who wouldn't want a second Sunrise? It's hardly a carbon copy anyway so it's like another wonderful gift. City Girl is a masterpiece as well. I'm not the biggest fan of Murnau's German films but his three surviving American films are probably the best proof of the sentiment that the silent cinema was at a miraculous level right when it was snuffed by sound. Murnau tragically died in an auto accident in 1931. I find it hard to imagine his work in the talkies but I have an inkling that the cinema would be rather different if he had survived.".

	schema:reviewBody "F. W. Murnau's 'forgotten' film probably isn't as good as Sunrise  and in fact looks like a pale imitation of it at times  but it's still better than much of Hollywood's output at the end of the 1920s. Big Charles Farrell plays Lem an innocent country bumpkin whose lack of assertiveness threatens his stilltobe consummated marriage to city girl Mary Duncan. Lem's curmudgeonly father takes an instant dislike to his son's new bride whom Lem impulsively wed while on a trip to sell Pop's harvest believing she is a gold digger  which is a bit odd given that Lem failed to sell his harvest at the minimum price necessary to make ends meet. Despite the whirlwind nature of their romance Kate really does love Lem even though he stands by and does nothing when his father knocks her about a bit While the characters and their motives are strictly ordinary it's Murnau's skill as a director that lifts City Girl above the ordinary. The juxtaposition between the stifling confines of the dirty city and the wide open spaces of Lem's homestead is subtly created as is the change of emphasis from the depressing impact of technology on city dwellers to the equally distressing influence of personal relationships in the countryside. Murnau also creates enormous sympathy for the plight of Kate in spite of the relatively clichd situation she finds herself in. She's no Lillian Gish type dependent on a broadshouldered hero to save her from her plight but a spirited independent heroine in her own right who pretty much forces Farrell's insipid Lem to face up to  and eventually overcome  his glaring shortcomings.".

What's more it's the only film I've ever seen which pinpoints a pivotal moment in American history it seems to be set before the Crash. One thing that precipitated the Great Depression was the squeeze on farmers who had no profit margin at all and whose only recourse was to plant more and more unwittingly worsening their own situation. One of the conflicts is that Charles Farrell is sent to the city to sell the wheat crop at the most advantageous price and this is a desperate necessity and not only fails to do so but comes home with a perhaps unsuitable new wife. The family patriarch has planted the farm in wheat right up to the front door and even reprimands his little girl for picking a stalk of it to play with. They are drowning in a product everybody needs but which barely supports them and on which they are completely dependent. The contrast between an agricultural America far from idyllic and a motorized city whose drudgery for most is at least as bad is redeemed by the awakening of human feelings and reordered priorities. Nothing will save these people but love and family.".

I must confess his early horror films do nothing for me it is the romantic pictures like Sunrise and City Girl that show his real talents. These films transcend time itself.Murnau is not afraid to depict characters who have a spiritual aspect to them....a quality totally lacking in today's pathetic heathen filmmakers. For instance Murnau in City Girl actually shows the main character Charles Farrell praying over his food in a public diner! When was the last time you saw that in a major motion picture? Refreshing!Mary Duncan does well as Kate the city girl. She had such soulful eyes and such a striking manner. She is totally believable as the woman struggling to survive a tough situation on a family farm run by a madman. Too bad this is the only silent film work of hers that has survived. Charles Farrell shows much depth in his silent film portrayals much more so than in his early talkies and City Girl is another fine example of his work.If you are a fan of silents or of Murnau's work don't neglect seeing this gem.".

	schema:headline " Very nearly as good as 'Sunrise'";
	schema:reviewBody "'City Girl' is a tantalising glimpse of what sort of Hollywood career F.W. Murnau might have had if not for his untimely death. In some ways this film resembles Murnau's masterpiece 'Sunrise' told in reverse here a young couple fall in love in the city Chicago then travel to the countryside Minnesota where they bitterly separate then reconcile.The two romantic leads are excellent. Charles Farrell gives possibly the best performance of his career here easily surpassing his performances in similar roles directed by Frank Borzage. Mary Duncan is a revelation why didn't she go on to a significant career? She shows herself here to be a talented actress as well as attractive in a believable way without the artificial prettiness that so many Hollywood actresses of this time had. The scene in which Farrell and Duncan chase each other through the field of grain is delightfully erotic a very convincing evocation of love mingled with sexual attraction.Murnau was a master at directing crowd scenes. I was deeply impressed by two scenes in this film one in a crowded railway car the other in a crowded restaurant. In both scenes the people in the background are doing exactly what they would be doing if this were real life. Two children are running up the corridor of the train. Compare this with so many other Hollywood films in which the background extras are obviously frustrated actors trying to call attention to themselves. I was amused to spot Murnau doing a Hitchcocklike cameo as a customer in the restaurant. Much less convincing is a scene depicting a crowded Chicago street. Although the very complicated set for this scene is technically impressive it's clearly a constructed set on an indoor soundstage not an actual exterior. Also I was displeased to see in 'City Girl' not one but two examples of that dire movie clich in which a character opens a newspaper and conveniently sees a headline that relates directly to his own personal situation.There is a very impressive sequence depicting the Chicago grain exchange and also a clever visual transition from the countryside to the city we see farmer David Torrence slicing a loaf of bread aiming the large knife directly at his own chest followed by a cut to a waitress in the restaurant operating an automatic breadslicing machine which was a hightech gizmo back in 1930. All of the characters in 'City Girl' are plausible and wellacted. I'll rate this movie 9 out of 10. Herr Murnau if only you hadn't taken that auto trip...".

The scene in which Farrell and Duncan chase each other through the field of grain is delightfully erotic a very convincing evocation of love mingled with sexual attraction.Murnau was a master at directing crowd scenes. I was deeply impressed by two scenes in this film one in a crowded railway car the other in a crowded restaurant. In both scenes the people in the background are doing exactly what they would be doing if this were real life. Two children are running up the corridor of the train. Compare this with so many other Hollywood films in which the background extras are obviously frustrated actors trying to call attention to themselves. I was amused to spot Murnau doing a Hitchcocklike cameo as a customer in the restaurant. Much less convincing is a scene depicting a crowded Chicago street. Although the very complicated set for this scene is technically impressive it's clearly a constructed set on an indoor soundstage not an actual exterior. Also I was displeased to see in 'City Girl' not one but two examples of that dire movie clich in which a character opens a newspaper and conveniently sees a headline that relates directly to his own personal situation.There is a very impressive sequence depicting the Chicago grain exchange and also a clever visual transition from the countryside to the city we see farmer David Torrence slicing a loaf of bread aiming the large knife directly at his own chest followed by a cut to a waitress in the restaurant operating an automatic breadslicing machine which was a hightech gizmo back in 1930. All of the characters in 'City Girl' are plausible and wellacted. I'll rate this movie 9 out of 10. Herr Murnau if only you hadn't taken that auto trip...";

Hayseed Lem Tustine Charles Farrell is sent by his dad David Torrence to Chicago to sell his wheat crop at a set price. Fending off flirtation on the train he meets kate a waitress in a chaotic restaurant while the wheat price dips. After a whirlwind courtship they marry and he returns home with the a wife and bad news about the wheat. Seeing his son as a rube who lost money and now being exploited by a city girl he explodes chides and emasculates the son. When the help shows up to harvest the wheat they get an eyeful of Lem's wife and like what they see. Things really take a turn for the worse when the crop is threatened and the bunk house boys rebel.Given their similar theme and settings City Girl cannot avoid comparison to Murnau's classic Sunrise and while it does not rise to its stature it retains his outstanding use of film language. Once again we have one of cinema's great visual storytellers unfold in image after image scenes of magnificent panorama and intense emotional closeup conveyed without utterance of a word. Scenes such as the camera riding on the wagon with the reapers and in a moment that teems with ironic beauty the arrival of the newlyweds in the wheat field at the farm glow with vitality and movement under the masterly hand of Murnau..Mary Duncan as Kate is a restrained Swanson who has her best scenes with the stern violent father played by David Torrence in a restrained version of his bro Ernest. Edith Yorke cowers and frets as ma while Richard Alexander as Mac excels as a harboring menace. Charles Farrell is mealy and spineless in a reprise of his Sunrise character in the throes of moral dilemma but without that dark side his performance annoys.Flaws exist with some slow moments midway the improbable actions of the hired hands and the father's stifling character limits the stories growth but Murnau for the most part provides us with more than a few gripping moments while deepening the cynicism and lasciviousness of his cast with expressive and informative closeups with little reliance on title cards.

She happens to read his postcard to mom already having noticed him praying and predicting exactly what he was going to order. But while corn is up the wheat is down something that the audience already knew by a view of the stock exchange. Romance quickly erupts between the two but family suspicions threaten it over his father's belief that she's no good. Those suspicions increase thanks to a roughneck farmhand Tom McGuire and insinuations made by the others who work for Torrence. A wonderfully fast moving silent drama remastered with a beautiful background score often jazzy and frequently profound. I don't watch many silent films and wasn't aware that this one was so imagine my delight in discovering it. Charles Farrell is a wonderful if rather naive hero while Mary Duncan adds many layers to her big city girl. I was glad to find out that she had a happy ending in life although Hollywood's loss was Palm Beach's gain. The expressions in her eyes are remarkably sincere so there is truly one of the great silent movie performances to watch. David Torrence and Edith Yorke are equally outstanding as Farrell's parents expressing great love for their son but totally different reactions to Miss Duncan. Yorke appears to be a bit older than Torrence making her somewhat too old for her party Farrell one of the most popular late silent era star is equally good showing a genuinely allAmerican look as the truly decent country kid. That's the future Anne Shirley as younger sister.Excellent direction by the legendary F.W. Murnau is matched by wonderful photography and quick editing so the film never drags. For novice viewers of silent movies like me this is a great one to start with although I have seen several of the major ones over the years. Now it's time to move onto more!".

David Torrence and Edith Yorke are equally outstanding as Farrell's parents expressing great love for their son but totally different reactions to Miss Duncan. Yorke appears to be a bit older than Torrence making her somewhat too old for her party Farrell one of the most popular late silent era star is equally good showing a genuinely allAmerican look as the truly decent country kid. That's the future Anne Shirley as younger sister.Excellent direction by the legendary F.W. Murnau is matched by wonderful photography and quick editing so the film never drags. For novice viewers of silent movies like me this is a great one to start with although I have seen several of the major ones over the years. Now it's time to move onto more!";

	schema:reviewBody "Principally I write to let my fellow silentfilm fans know that the new release Oct. 1 2015 UPC 024543991151by Fox Cinema Archives does contain the wonderful score composed by Christopher Caliendo. Often the soundtrack can make or break a release and the music here is wonderful. It is the same as found on the earlier and quite expensive Murnau Borzage and Fox box set. Secondly I would take issue with those who have said here that City Girl is not up to Murnau's earlier standards. In that regard I would point out that every Van Gogh is not Starry Night. I agree that this film is not a masterpiece like Sunrise or The Last Laugh but it is nonetheless a terrifically rendered film. The cinematography is stunning as is the art direction. It really captures the flavor of the late 1920s and serves in several ways as an inadvertent documentary. The scenes in Chicago are a virtual snapshot of urban living and the footage of premechanized farming is also worthy of note. I for one had never seen a muledrawn threshing machine in operation. It really is fascinating. As for the cast I've never seen a bad performance by Charles Farrell and he is absolutely believable in this role. And Mary Duncan is simply radiant. Strong performances by Edith Yorke a young Anne Shirley Guinn Williams and the always superb David Torrence make for an all around enjoyable film. In fact this is one of my favorite second tier silent films. I think it is well worth your while.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a fan of F.W Murnau's horror films like 1922's Nosferatu  1926's Faust. I found the movie to be a bit disappointing. Don't get me wrong I love his films that picturization the harsh realities of life such in the case of 1924's the Last Laugh but this movie is just a nearly a mirror image of his previous wellmade film 1927's Sunrise. While Sunrise had a complex story that mixed melodrama romantic and thriller well. This movie sadly didn't live up to that. Based on the play The Mud Turtle by Elliott Lester. The movie tells the story of a young woman Kate Mary Duncan a waitress in a busy Chicago lunchroom who lives a dreary city life. She dreams of escaping the depressing realism city terms and returning to the romanticism beliefs of the countryside. She sees Lem Tustine Charles Farrell as her way out. Lem is a nave and sweetnatured farm boy who has been sent to the city to sell his family's wheat crop. Over the course of a few visits they fall in love marry and set out for the wheatfields. Kate find out firsthand that country life isn't what she dreamt it could be as Lem's harsh tyrannical father David Torrence run and work his farmhands hard in a nearly fascist dictator state. Can Kate survive farmlife or will she leave back for the city? All of the acting is pretty welldone. Due to the director inability to secure the services of Sunrise star Janet Gaynor. The director was forced by the studio to substitute for Mary Duncan. She was chosen reportedly because she was the girlfriend of one of the Fox executives. I was disappointed to read that Mary Duncan gave up the profession just a couple of years after this movie wrapped as she had real star quality. Charles Farrell had a longer lasting career before going into politics. He end being the mayor of Palm Springs for a while. Both leads deliver tremendous performances in City Girl. David Torrence plays the formidable father figure with great vigor and is terrifying. His constant scowl works to overshadow the central romance. Still his character never made much sense in the reason why he is angry. The whole ending turn seem unrealistic and unexplained as hell. Richard Alexander as Mac the quietly devious but charming love interestingrival was alright for the most part. One thing that the film seem to missing was the German Expressionism. Everything here seems to be made in the style of American filmmaking. Gone are the exaggerated fairytale world city sets that made movies like Sunrise stand out. Everything here was indeed control by the lower budget due to the Great Depression. The city sets were nearly limited to two scenes in a small studio. One is the busy diner where Murnau captures city life as a bustling and crowded as every extra seems in a rush to get to one place or another without showing much of the city landscape. Two is the apartment that Kate lives. Her apartment looks out over flashing neon signs and an elevated railway just inches from her window is thrown in for good measure. I was really hoping for more than that. The country sequences are poorly lit with characters using oil lamps in order to navigate the house and fields at night. There were a few impressive tracking shots but for the most part. It wasn't used due to the change in locations. F.W Murnau wanted it in Minnesota but due to budget it was filmed in Oregon. You truly don't see much of the landscape in this film. F.W Murnau always used forced perspective in most of his films but in this film. It was indeed missing. Director F.W. Murnau wanted the title of the film to be Our Daily Bread but the studio refused as the title might offended Christians watching the film. City Girl went on somewhat call 'the Intruder' in French cinemas due to misunderstand in language of the plot as people thought it was a murder mystery like Sunrise. City Girl was made in a time where silent films were falling out of fashion for 'talkies' movies. While the film which had been shot silent. The studio scheduled to have parts of it reshot with sound. Murnau refused wanting nothing to do with talkies. Due to this and other clashes with the Fox studio he left the picture before it was completed. An assistant director finished it. A version of the film with some sound elements was made alongside the silent version but was lost over time. As of this writing the silent version is the only copy of this film. So indeed the final product perhaps was Murnau's vision and its shows. Since the movie is a public domain silent film. The score of the film differs by copy. Arthur Kay's original score might be missing in some of them. Depending on your copy Christopher Caliendo might be yours. Its feature an upbeat fast tempo but jolting score which captures the frenetic stopstart pace of city life and more apathetic pace for the country. It's the best version. The movie was indeed cut as there are 90 minutes versions and 77 minute ones. For an old silent film most of the copies are surprising well restored. There are a few dirt on the film but for the most part nice and clean. Look for the Masters of Cinema BluRay version or 20th Century Fox  Region 1 for the best copies. Overall City Girl a great example about love and the struggle between rural life and urbanization. It's a paradoxical retelling of the fable of the city rat versus rat fields.".

The two meet in Kate's restaurant and before they know it they fall in love and impulsively marry. The road ahead isn't smooth going though complicated by Lem's stern disapproving father David Torrence and an unscrupulous farmhand who has his own agenda for Kate Richard Alexander. Will the love that Lem and Kate have be strong enough to weather the storm?The story is fairly basic melodrama but told well and entertainingly. This reviewer isn't in favor of people marrying hastily but Lem and Kate make a sweet couple and you genuinely want things to work out for them. There are some of the country bumpkin stereotypes in the story but the central characters are presented as individuals. Mary Duncan did very fine expressive work as Kate able to be sweet and charming but also convincingly standing her ground. Charles Farrell is very charming as Lem and captures his character's emotional conflict wanting to protect his wife but not wanting to oppose his father very well. The supporting players also make good contributions particularly Richard Alexander as the scheming farmhand  he shows his character's sleaziness and guile without overdoing it. This movie was made at the tail end of the silent era made in 1929 but released in 1930 and shows Murnau's mastery of film. The cinematography and editing are practically flawless with fluid camerawork and evocative shots as well as some pretty expressive titles. The countryside is filmed beautifully. I was able to watch a crisp print of this film with a wonderful score by Christopher Caliendo. A very engaging film. SCORE 810".

We are truly in the realm of Italian madness.David Hasselhoff plays Gary boyfriend of the mumbling Leslie who won't let him into her pants. Won't even give him tops and fingers. Gary and Leslie are currently squatting in an abandoned hotel researching either a witch or witch lights or the gates to hell or something to do with a German book.

As I said it's kind of difficult to get a handle on what's truly going on but it seems that the old woman who may or may not be a ghost or a witch wants to open the gates of hell by killing folks who have sinned in certain ways.

It takes a while to get to the good stuff in this film but the gore has an nice nasty edge to it.Gore aside the Italian daftness quotient is as high as ever. We don't have dubbing but we do have Hasselhoff telling a fully clothed woman to get dressed a whole lot of bizarre visual trickery like the witchlights and the world's most terrified looking child actor.A lot has been made about how bad this kid is but to be honest with you he just looks like he's scared of everyone in the film and would rather be anywhere else at all. I'd be scared too if I had to act with a woman who looked like she's been drinking three bottles of vodka a day for at least a decade.And another thing never turn your back on Linda Blair. As usual she goes all possessed near the end of the film in a scene that is pure comedy unintended of course. To cement it's place as one of the most enjoyable films an industry in decline released as the decade drew to a close we have our twist ending which is so abrupt and stupid you just have to applaud.Witchcraft has the lot gore madness incoherence and even a couple of scenes that are genuinely creepy the Satan rape bit. As it seems to be unfairly trampled on by all and sundry it turns up cheap on Amazon. For the two or three people actually interested in what Italian films were like after the golden age had passed I'd buy Ghosthouse. Then this one.".

I do think it was a little wasted on this particular film though. Never mind.The film itself isn't too bad it just drags a bit in some places and I didn't like the witchcraft theme. I found the scenes where people are transported via that Doctor Who style vortex extremely cringemaking. It looked like something from a cheap 80's scifi film! Other than that I thought the death of the old woman was excellent  she gets her lips sewn together and is hung upside down above a lit fireplace. She can't scream for help and the others have no idea she's there. Now there's an original death for you! The parts where the helicopter flies around the house are also excellent  the people inside can't signal for help because the house has trapped them inside. I would recommend horror fans to give this a watch it's silly and boring at times but the good bits make up for that.".

Double billed on a new blue ray with Ghost House Witchery has David Hasselhoff post Knight Rider but before Baywatch and Linda Blair waaaaaaay after Exorcist. Another Italian horror film filmed in Massachusetts this one is directed by Fabrizio Laurenti. Like the Lenzi horror films this one is so campy so bad that its kind of fun to watch. And who IS that Lady in Black? She and her magic gemstone pop up now and then adding to the mystery. A real estate agent tries to sell a house on a private island but Gary Hasselhoff and his assistant entered the house without permission to take photos. Jane L. Blair has her own secrets as you will see. More cheesy special effects and of course the usual blood and gore. I'm surprised that Linda Blair still wanted to do films like this since she was so well known for The Exorcist. It's pretty creepy. And as of today only 3 out of 10 stars on IMDb.The story starts out pretty solid unlike most oldie horror films. The acting and directing are a bit lame but everyone does a pretty good job with the lines they are given. For a lot of of the cast this is the only film they ever made. About two thirds of the way through the plot gets weird and goes down these left turns. Lots of screaming organ music and smoke. Similar plot to Ten Little Indians where the guests get knocked off one by one. Interesting if just for the historical value.".

Safe to say I enjoyed Witchery more than I thought I would .

	schema:headline " Linda Blair reminds us why she is a horror icon in this horrifying tale of witchcraft and revenge.";
	schema:reviewBody "Linda Blair has been acting for forty years now and while she will never escape the part of Regan MacNeil in The Exorcist few of her subsequent horror films have used her legendary status to such great effect as Witchery does. She plays Jane Brooks a pregnant single woman who travels with her family to an abandoned island hotel that her parents want to purchase. They are accompanied by a couple of real estate agents Catherine Hickland and Rick Farnsworth and upon arriving at the island they meet a photographer David Hasselhoff and his writer girlfriend Leslie Cumming who are illegally squatting in the hotel while investigating the legend of a local witch Hildegard Knef. It seems that a longago witchhunt resulted in her suicide and she was with child at the time. Unaware of the danger Jane has recently dreamt of the witch's dramatic death and Jane's little brother Tommy Michael Manchester has been more directly visited by her spooky blackclad spirit which he calls 'the lady in black'. The group's time at the island inn begins quietly enough unknown to them however the Lady in Black has already dispatched the captain of their hired boat George Stevens. Before long the isolation and cold begin to affect everyone and it is during this period of moodiness and tension that the Lady in Black begins her reign of terror. She plans to avenge her own fate by possessing Jane and sacrificing her companions and her unborn child. Each of her other victims fulfills an aspect of her vengeful curse  greed lust and the blood of a virgin. As the sun goes down and the sea becomes wild she haunts them one by one in gruesome horrifying ways. The island location is effectively scary and the inn is very creepy and hauntingly shot. It's such a colorful film that it reminds me of Dario Argento's work. The lighting is excellent and the set decoration is perfectly spooky. The soundtrack is very effective and unique. The horror effects are extreme terrifying and unforgettable. The cinematography is great and it is this that brings us back to Linda Blair. The creative team behind this film shoots her like a horror star should be shot lots of dramatic pushins lingering closeups that subtly detail Jane's incremental possession and moments that are reminiscent of other great horror films. There are hidden homages to Rosemary's Baby Jacob's Ladder The Shining Black Sunday and of course The Exorcist. She does a great job and absolutely steals the show with her moody and understated performance. That isn't to say that the rest of the cast disappoints Catherine Hickland is sexy and very good and veteran performer Annie Ross is memorable as Jane's bitchy mother Rose. Hasselhoff gives it his best but he is not essentially a film star and his television persona gets in the way of his performance. Blair and young Michael Manchester have a wonderful chemistry together. The film is otherwise so violent and creepy in a good way that it desperately needs their warmth Blair also played a mother in 2003's Monster Makers and her maternal scenes in that film have the same tender feeling to them. Lastly Hildegard Knef in one of her last roles plays a great witch and she has the most amazing voice and accent. Along with Blair she was also perfectly cast. But it's Blair's movie all the way. Jane Brooks also seems to have some psychic ability and this aspect of the film hearkens back to Exorcist II The Heretic. I think Witchery is up there with The Exorcist Exorcist II Hell Night and Summer of Fear as Blair's best genre work to date.".

	schema:headline " JUST about worth it for the gore. Possibly.";
	schema:reviewBody "An ItalianAmerican coproduction costarring Linda Blair and David 'The Hoff' Hasselhoff how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat?Well based on the uneventful extremely tedious and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so I would have said 'very easily' thankfully however things do eventually get a tad more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy a smattering of nudity too unfortunately my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive material.The Hoff stars as Gary a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend Leslie Leslie Cumming to a rundown hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project a book about witches whilst there frustrated Gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving Leslie of her virginity.His plans for nookie are scuppered however by the unexpected arrival of property developers Freddie and Rose Brooks Robert Champagne and Annie Ross their pregnant daughter Jane Blair son Tommy Michael Manchester pretty nymphomaniac architect Linda Sullivan Catherine Hickland and estate agent Jerry Rick Farnsworth who have come to inspect the island's hotel.After explaining their unexpected presence on the island Gary and Leslie are welcomed by the property's new owners and when a violent storm suddenly picks up making it perilous to return to the mainland everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building.

	onyx:emotionText "An ItalianAmerican coproduction costarring Linda Blair and David 'The Hoff' Hasselhoff how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat?Well based on the uneventful extremely tedious and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so I would have said 'very easily' thankfully however things do eventually get a tad more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy a smattering of nudity too unfortunately my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive material.The Hoff stars as Gary a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend Leslie Leslie Cumming to a rundown hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project a book about witches whilst there frustrated Gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving Leslie of her virginity.His plans for nookie are scuppered however by the unexpected arrival of property developers Freddie and Rose Brooks Robert Champagne and Annie Ross their pregnant daughter Jane Blair son Tommy Michael Manchester pretty nymphomaniac architect Linda Sullivan Catherine Hickland and estate agent Jerry Rick Farnsworth who have come to inspect the island's hotel.After explaining their unexpected presence on the island Gary and Leslie are welcomed by the property's new owners and when a violent storm suddenly picks up making it perilous to return to the mainland everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building. Unfortunately unbeknownst to the hotel's new guests the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch Hildegard Knef who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life. One by one victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs before meeting a terrible fate.None of this makes much sense and the acting is atrocious Manchester as Tommy is particularly bad whilst Hasselhoff proves to be one of the better performers which speaks volumes about the others but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore Rose has her lips sewn together before being roasted alive in a fireplace Jerry is crucified and burnt alive Linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish!!

Jane's Mother  Father Rose Annie Ross  Freddie Robert Champagne are interested in buying an old deserted hotel on an island about 50 miles from Boston renovating it  reopening it. Together with Jane  their young son Tommy Michael Manchester Rose  Freddie are planning to travel to the island with an architect named Linda Sullivan Catherine Hickland to check on the amount of work that needs doing they also meet up with the estate agent Jerry Giordano Rick Farnsworth  hire a local fisherman named Sam George Stevens to take them to the island. Once there they enter the hotel  begin to inspect the property while back on the boat Sam is killed  the boat is let loose to sail off into the distance. They discover two unexpected guests in the shape of a photographer named Gary David Hasselhoff  his virgin fianc Leslie Leslie Cumming who happens to be researching a book that she is writing about the gruesome legends  superstitions surrounding the infamous island  hotel. As the night draws on a raging storm outside isolates them from the mainland as a mysterious 'lady in black' Hildegard Knef keeps popping up as the ancient evil that resides in the hotel seeks fresh victims for demonic possession human sacrifice  Satanic rites...The director of this American Italian coproduced film is somewhat shrouded in mystery as the IMDb lists Fabrizio Laurenti as Martin Newlin but there are rumours that Joe D'Amato did the honours either way to be honest despite it's bad reputation I found Witchery quite entertaining in a sobadit'sgood cheesy sort of way. The script credited to Harry Spalding  Daniele Stroppa on the IMDb again is confusing too as the actual credit on the film itself is Daniel Davis anyway whoever wrote this thing did a decent job please stop laughing. At heart it's a haunted house horror but adds some gory deaths  a surreal feeling to everything. The different sets of characters have reasonable motives  didn't get on my nerves as much as I'd thought they might it's not plotted very well it doesn't make a whole a lot of sense  the dialogue isn't exactly top drawer stuff but as a whole Witchery entertained me for it's 95 odd minute duration plain  simple. It's reasonably well paced a little slow to get going maybe but there are plenty of surreal bizarre goingson  gruesome deaths to keep one amused. One part of Witchery which destroys some of it's credibility is this socalled storm there is no storm in sight  the sea is probably calm enough to swim in Witchery's supposed 'twist' ending didn't really work for me either  just check out the dumb expression on Cummings face on that final freezeframe. The hotel provides for a good isolated location  adds a certain atmosphere to the film which has the distinctive indefinable 'horror' feel throughout cheap horror at that. Technically Witchery is not too bad at all it was obviously shot on location so it looks good throughout  while not exactly the pinnacle of filmmaking finesse it's overall production values are slightly better than expected. The violence  gore is of typical Euro explicitness a woman has her lips sewn shut  hung inside a fireplace so she can't scream as the others light it someone is crucified  then burned alive impaled on a swordfish someones veins expand  pop  a woman is raped by a man with no lips. Witchery was shot in English so there is no dubbing as far as acting goes David Hasselhoff  Linda Blair in the same film what more can I say?! Yes ladies Hasselhoff does take his shirt off  for the lads Cummings takes hers off. Both Hasselhoff  Blair are a hoot to watch in this thing however the little kid is very annoying  really can't act at all. I sure most sane filmgoers will disagree with my opinions but I still stand by the fact that I liked it  would happily watch it again Witchery is pretty good fun  definitely worth a watch if your into 'bad' films or your a horror fan in general.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are many different versions of this one floating around so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing. Some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there. The cut I saw has the onscreen title WITCHCRAFT EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by Shriek Show who maintain the original US release title WITCHERY for the DVD release. It's a nicelooking print and seems to have all of the footage but has some croppingaspect ratio issues. In Italy it was released as LA CASA 4 WITCHCRAFT. The first two LA CASA releases were actually the first two EVIL DEAD films retitled and the third LA CASA was another film by the same production company Filmirage which is best known here in America as GHOSTHOUSE. To make matters even more confusing WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2. Except in Germany where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually THE OGRE DEMONS 3. OK I better just shut up now. I'm starting to confuse myself!Regardless of the title this is a very hitormiss horror effort. Some of it is good some of it isn't. I actually was into this film for the first half or so but toward the end it became a senseless mess. A large vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from Boston is the setting as various people get picked off onebyone by a German speaking witch Hildegard Knef. Photographer Gary David Hasselhoff who wants to capture Witch Light and his virginal writer girlfriend Leslie Cumming who is studying witchcraft are shacking up at the hotel without permission. Along comes real estate agent Jerry Rick Farnsworth who's showing off the property to potential buyers Rose Annie Ross and Freddie Robert Champagne Brooks. Also tagging along are their children pregnant grown daughter Jane Linda Blair and very young son Tommy Michael Manchester as well as oversexed architect Linda Sullivan Catherine Hickland  Hasselhoff's wife at the time. Once everyone is inside their boat driver is killed hung and the boat disappears so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the Lady in Black.So what can you expect to find here? Plenty of unpleasantries! One of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slowroasted by the rest of the cast. There's also a crucifixion witches eating a dead baby a swordfish through the head someone set on fire a possession a Sesame Street tape recorder the virgin getting raped by some demon a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff. From a technical standpoint it's a nicelooking film with pretty good cinematography a decent score and good gore effects. The hotelisland setting is also pretty nice. Blair particularly at the end and Ross both seem like they're having fun and Knef is great as the evil witch. Even though people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days he's not bad in his role either.On the down side despite all the gore the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour. The supernatural themes are muddled and confusing too. When characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy. And the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber. And while most of the cast is at least decent a few of the performances particularly the actress who plays Hasselhoff's girlfriend and the kid are so bad they're constantly distracting.".

Tommy has a little Sesame Street recorder which tapes The Lady in Black's mumbo jumbo chants obviously used for later. For some reason The Lady in Black likes to visit little Tommy.

	schema:reviewBody "A really very bad movie with a very few good moments or qualities.It starts off with pregnant Linda Blair who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks I'm not sure. She jumps through a window and wakes up and we see she is very pregnant. The degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movie.She and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who I thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island. Italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies! On the island already are David Hasselhoff and his Germanspeaking virgin girlfriend you know how Germans are said to love Hasselhoff.... He's taking photographs and she's translating an esoteric German book about witches I think.Also traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it and a real estate agent and a woman I thought was their daughter. Evidently she was an architect and Linda Blair and the boy are the older couple's children. I guess they all traveled to the island together but it really seemed like Linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them maybe they were filmed separately.The hotel seems neat certainly from the exteriors but it isn't used to any great effect. An old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in German sometimes which he eventually records on his Sesame Street tape recorder.People start getting killed either in their dreams or sucked into hell or something. Some of these gore scenes are OK but not enough to recommend the movie. Though the copy I watched stated it is uncut on the box cover the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut. Much of the scene is showing another character's reaction shots since we're not seeing anything ourselves. The creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messylooking wound of a mouth rapes someone. He looked particularly nasty. There's a laughably and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is possessed. I wish if a horror movie is going to cast her they would do something original with her role and let her leave Exorcist behind her except for the yearly horror conventions.In the weird largely Italian tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to this is also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2. That is it is supposedly a sequel to Casa 3  Ghosthouse La 1988  it's not that's also a better movie than this one. La Casa 1 and two were The Evil Dead 1981 and Evil Dead II 1987  again unrelated to Witchery and La Casa 3 and much better than those. There's also a Casa 5 La 1990 AKA House 5 which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake La Casa series and the series House House 1986 House II The Second Story 1987 The Horror Show 1989 AKA House III and House IV 1992. How's The Horror Show fit in there? It doesn't really it claimed to be a sequel thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less or more? confusion. Oddly The Horror Show is also AKA Horror House and La Casa 5 is also AKA Horror House 2. Does your head hurt yet?".

	schema:reviewBody "Dear Lord I wrote a brief synopsis but I guess most of it got edited out. I have got to give it another try. Let me start out by saying. Have you every wanted to rent a horror movie so badly because it was so awful you knew it would make you laugh your head off? Well my friends this is the movie. Don't get me wrong I Love Linda Blair but this film is a riot from hell. As I stated in my previous notation Annie Ross who plays Linda's Mother Rose in the film actually makes the film hilarious. She is convinced that this abandoned Motel out on an island is going to really be an investment when they all arrive to view the place Annie Ross says This place is a wreck! it's going to take a Gdamn fortune to fix it up. The driver of the boat that has to take the prospective buyers out to the Motel says You had better be ready here before sundown or I am leaving. Annie says Hard Nose Bastard. Her husband in the film is a flirt from the work go he makes pass after pass at the real estate sales person Linda who really is hot but she wouldn't give him the time of day just tease the hell out of him. If you really want to see a horror movie that was done so poorly please rent this one. I watched it over and over again because I needed a good laugh and I get one every time I rent this film. Linda Blair plays a pregnant lady in the film and goes up to the rest room and sits on the side of the bathtub and begins to open up a bottle of pills can't get the top off the pills and drops them into this bathtub filled with black water. Something unknown grabs her hand and pulls her through the drain can you believe it and she finds herself underground watching some kind of Satanic ritual passes out and then miraculously wakes up on the floor of the bathroom on her back saying My Baby my Baby. What was that all about? I sure can't figure it out. Back to Rose she is disgusted to the point of no return and says to Linda Blair Jane give me one of your pills Linda can't find them and believes they must have dropped on the bathroom floor so Rose says WELL THEN They must still be there!!!! duh duh. Needless today each member starts to disappear and of course Rose goes first after they underground Satanic people tie her lips together they hang her upside down in the fireplace. The remainder of the familyunbeknownst to them supposedly decide they are cold and want to build a fire. Rose gets microwaved to a crisp because get this eventually they start to smell a funny smell coming from the fireplace and then within seconds Rose's body drops almost all the way down in plain view and when the family realizes it's Rose all they say is Oh we've got to get out of here. Can you believe it? Gosh what a gas. Rose is supposed to be Linda Blair's' Mother but Linda calls her Rose throughout the entire film. There are so many mistakes on this film you would laugh your rear off just counting the mistakes. I would guess that It may have cost the producers about 5000 dollars to make the film and I would guess it made about 2000 dollars. That's about 100.00 dollars for each actor. Oh man I've got to go because I am laughing so hard right now I can barely type. Go get this film you've just got to. And if you like Linda Blair there are about eight or nine movie of this same quality let me know I'll email you the titles. One is called Grotesque. You've have to get this movie at a movie place that specializes in dull old crap. I'll tell you another film that it about 10 times funnier than Witchery A Woman Obsessed now this film you will totally pass out laughing at this one it puts Witchery to shame. I love ya Linda but ya got to make better choices.".

What was that all about? I sure can't figure it out. Back to Rose she is disgusted to the point of no return and says to Linda Blair Jane give me one of your pills Linda can't find them and believes they must have dropped on the bathroom floor so Rose says WELL THEN They must still be there!!!! duh duh. Needless today each member starts to disappear and of course Rose goes first after they underground Satanic people tie her lips together they hang her upside down in the fireplace. The remainder of the familyunbeknownst to them supposedly decide they are cold and want to build a fire. Rose gets microwaved to a crisp because get this eventually they start to smell a funny smell coming from the fireplace and then within seconds Rose's body drops almost all the way down in plain view and when the family realizes it's Rose all they say is Oh we've got to get out of here. Can you believe it? Gosh what a gas. Rose is supposed to be Linda Blair's' Mother but Linda calls her Rose throughout the entire film. There are so many mistakes on this film you would laugh your rear off just counting the mistakes. I would guess that It may have cost the producers about 5000 dollars to make the film and I would guess it made about 2000 dollars. That's about 100.00 dollars for each actor. Oh man I've got to go because I am laughing so hard right now I can barely type. Go get this film you've just got to. And if you like Linda Blair there are about eight or nine movie of this same quality let me know I'll email you the titles. One is called Grotesque. You've have to get this movie at a movie place that specializes in dull old crap. I'll tell you another film that it about 10 times funnier than Witchery A Woman Obsessed now this film you will totally pass out laughing at this one it puts Witchery to shame. I love ya Linda but ya got to make better choices.";

THE EVIL DEAD was released in Italy as LA CASA and its sequel was LA CASA 2. Then Umberto Lenzi made a film called GHOSTHOUSE which was released in Italy as LA CASA 3 even though it was in no way shape or form connected to the Raimi series. Then this film was released as LA CASA 4 but again no Raimi connection. Outside of Italy it was known as WITCHCRAFT GHOSTHOUSE 2 and the current title listed above.The typical group of people arrive at your typical old hotel where there's the typical legends surrounding its curse. Apparently many years ago a pregnant woman committed suicide to keep from being burned alive as a witch. Years later a strange silent actress moved into the house and was apparently the last owner but soon our new guests start to fall victim to the curse. You have to hand it to the Italians when it comes to the horror genre but by 1988 their magic was running out and that's certainly true here even though they did manage to get Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff to appear in the film. This is your typical cult mess that features a little bit of gore but not enough to keep people interested. The story isn't any better or worse than a dozen other witchcraft tales we've seen from any country but the major problem here is the direction by Laurenti which really shouldn't be called direction at all. The movie moves at a snails pace none of the build ups are any good there's no suspense and the worst sin is that the thing is just downright boring. It was rumored that Joe D'Amato did some of the direction as he and Laurenti would codirect a movie a couple years later. Having seen dozens of D'Amato's work I'd say he did have a hand in this as it has the same slow pace of many of his films. The one main reason to see the film is a creative death scene where a woman gets her lips sewn together before being hung upside down in a chimney to be burned alive. Blair actually gives a pretty good performance with ol' David getting to act as the boyfriend of a witchcraft specialist who refuses to put out for him or anyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Witchery might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80's but luckily enough it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices. Honestly the screenplay doesn't make one iota of sense but who cares when Linda Blair with an exploded hairstyle portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and David Hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer who can't seem to get laid in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo sewnshut lips upside down crucifixions vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune. Eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts. The young couple is there to investigate the place's dark history the dysfunctional family with a pregnant Linda Blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are considers reopening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex. They're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady  an aging actress or something who always dresses in black  starts taking them out in various engrossing ways. Everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window. Anyway the plot is definitely of minor importance in an Italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spinoff of The Evil Dead. The atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the makeup effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film. There's something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can only assume that Linda Blair David Hasselhoff and Hildegard Knef were not exactly at the peak of their careers when they agreed to act in a bclass Italian horror production with a cast of virtually unknown actors. When I think about great actors David Hasselhoff doesn't really come to my mind but delirious as it may sound the Hoff actually does a decent job here and manages to stand out which I guess says a lot about the rest of the cast. David gives us a very likeable lead that seems to genuinely care about the rest of the characters and goes out of his way to save the day. As for Linda her acting is decent and it is nice to see a horror icon. The enjoyment of seeing Blair in this flick mostly comes from the campiness of her character towards the last minutes but the truth is that she is not really our lead. The final girl is portrayed by the unknown actress Leslie Cumming who wins the award for one of the most unexcitedlooking characters in a horror flick. Seriously I don't expect superb acting in a bclass horror flick but this girl takes things to the next level by lacking any kind of emotion and speaking in a monotonous tone of voice throughout the entire film.In Witchery the story goes something like this A young woman named Leslie travels to a remote island to do some research for a book that she is writing which is about the occult. Leslie's boyfriend named Gary travels with her to take some photos for the book since Leslie wants to provide photographic evidence about the existence of witches and according to some local folklore there is a strange phenomena that occurs in the island known as the witch's light. Though Gary is a genuinely nice guy and he wants to help his girlfriend with her book he also sees this trip as a perfect opportunity to finally get some action with his girlfriend don't get your hopes up Gary! Though Leslie appears to be in her mid twenties she is a virgin and very proud of it since she believes that virginity equals knowledge or something like that. During their trip to the island Leslie and Gary decide to stay at an abandoned hotel which they are not supposed to do since it's private property unbeknownst to Gary who was under the impression that they actually had a permit as this is what Leslie informed himOn the other hand we have a very heterogeneous group of people that also travel to the hotel where Leslie and Gary are staying. We have the Brooks family composed by a greedy matriarch named Rose her creepy husband Freddie and their two children Jane Linda Blair and Tommy. It should be mentioned that the mom and dad appear to be in their late fifties and the youngest son Tommy appears to be less than ten years old... unusual but not impossible. Oh also Jane is pregnant though the baby's father is not once mentioned during the entire film. Jane really loves her younger brother Tommy and cares for him at all times while Rose the mother appears to be somewhat of a bitch towards her son and the rest of family... and towards everyone else for that matter but don't worry folks she'll suffer horribly. Why the hell are the Brooks going to the island? Because Rose wants to buy the old decaying hotel and turn it into a private club to make tons of money out of it. Joining the family we have Linda Sullivan a young sexcrazed architect hired by Mrs. Brooks to assist them with the renovations and lastly we have Tony Giordano a goofylooking real estate agent who is trying to convince Mrs. Brooks that buying the old hotel is the deal of the century.When the Brooks arrive to the hotel with the architect and the real estate agent they don't hide their dismay when they find the young couple of squatters staying there. However Gary manages to ease up the tension by explaining that they didn't mean to cause any harm and offers everyone some coffee. Believe it or not this does the trick and everyone manages to get along with each other just fine... well everyone except for Rose did I already mention that she's a bitch?Unknown to everyone staying at the hotel the place is also inhabited by an old witch played by German actress and singer Hildegard Knef who wears tons of make up and apparently smokes two packs of cigarettes a day judging by the sound of her voice. This unnamed witch used her powers to cause certain events that brought all these people to the hotel at the same time. Besides using her powers to lure all these strangers into the hotel the witch also kills the guy who drove everyone to the island by boat preventing them from leaving so in the end it's no coincidence that these strangers find themselves living under the same roof. Now what does the witch want? Eh... it's a bit confusing but at some point it is revealed by one of the characters that several years ago the old witch was a actually a beautiful actress who starred in several films and was unable to cope with the idea of aging so she retired from acting because she didn't want to be seen anymore. From what I could understand in this convoluted mess the witch needs to sacrifice certain type of people to complete a ritual that will allow her to be reborn through Jane's baby... or something.In lieu of a completely coherent story Witchery provides a truckload of entertainment and features some gruesome and nicely done death scenes. Remember earlier when I said that Rose was a major bitch and that she was going to suffer a great deal? Well this is what happens to her at some point Rose begins to rant and verbally abuse everyone including her little son. In order to prevent things from escalating her husband advises her to take a nap though he is a bit creepy I gotta give him credit for handling the situation with class. Rose agrees to lie down for a while but before she gets to bed she is sent to another dimension that takes place inside the house we'll get to that later and when she travels to this place she is greeted by the witch's minions a couple of demented centenarians who sew her lips together preventing her from being able to speak again thanks you guys!. As if this wasn't punishment enough Rose is later jammed inside the chimney and...what do you know? Since the air is a little bit chilly the colorful group of characters decide to gather around the chimney and light a fire ignoring the fact that Rose is stuck in there slowly burning to death while everyone enjoys the heat in a slightly humorous moment Rose's husband comments that the pieces of wood that they used to light the fire smell funnyBesides Rose's death scene Witchery features some other scenes and moments that deserve an honorable mention... well at least a regular mention. As I briefly mentioned before some of the characters are randomly sent to another dimension through a weird reddish vortex. We don't get an explanation about this realm but we do get to see that the witch also known as the lady in black seems to be the ruler of this place filled with her weird servants. Are we supposed to simply assume that this realm is some kind of inbetween territory between Hell and Earth? I'm not so sure but I do know that while the scenes that take place in this odd parallel universe are somewhat creepy they could have made an effort to make it look less like some kind of barnyard from hell. Oh and also the witch's minions are weird as hell they laugh maniacally all the time they taunt their victims and they carry a doll don't expect an explanation.Finally our beloved Linda Blair finds herself playing a possessed girl again but this time her portrayal and the reasons behind it are rather cheesy unlike the genuinely scary scenes from The Exorcist. In this case Jane is possessed by the witch and when she talks she mimics the words while we actually hear Hildegard Knef's voice. Also for some reason while being possessed Linda's hairstyle changes and it looks like she had just auditioned for a heavy metal music video or something. Not sure why a witch possessing another person's body would actually take the time to change her hairstyle but I've never found myself in this situation so maybe it's more common than I think. At this point Janethe witch confronts the remaining characters that managed to survive this deadly mess and delivers a brief monologue in which she reveals herself as the witch and explains the reasons behind her actions before attempting to kill the sole survivors. However our beloved hero Gary grabs a voice recorder in which Tommy Jane's little brother recorded himself repeatedly saying I love you Jane. This seems to do the trick since Jane stops being possessed for like fifteen seconds but in order to prevent the evil from taking over herself again she jumps off the window and dies. Unfortunately this clearly doesn't give us a happy ending first of all Jane a nice gal had to sacrifice her life and then Gary our beloved hero dies. The sole survivors end up being only Tommy and the insultingly dull Leslie who was at some point sent to the parallel dimension and raped by a skinny guy with sewn lips just like Rose. In the end we see Leslie lying in a hospital bed where she is informed by a nurse that Tommy is fine and that she doesn't have to worry because her baby is fine which prompts Leslie to look at the camera and say My baby?! with an odd expression of horror. Priceless!I highly recommend this flick to anyone who wants pure entertainment gruesome deaths a decent amount of ridiculousness that doesn't necessarily turn the movie into a comedy some genuinely creepy moments and a plot that fails to provide enough logic.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a true direct sequel to Scotland Yard jagt Dr. Mabuse from 1 year earlier. Normally you don't need to watch any of the other Dr. Mabuse movies in order to watch just one but this movie might be an exception to that. All of the Dr. Mabuse movies from the '60's have sort of the same style as the early James Bond movies but since the first Dr. Mabuse movie from the '60's is from 1960 and the first James Bond movie is from 1962 it's not completely fair to call the Dr. Mabuse movies a ripoff from the James Bond movie since it obviously had developed its style before the first James Bond movies became an huge success. Nevertheless its very much thinkable that the '60's Dr. Mabuse movies were inspired by the James Bond novels by Ian Fleming since it obviously shows some similarities in its odd gadgets and way the villain and his organization is often being portrayed as well as his plan to 'take over the world'. On top of that I think that this particular Dr. Mabuse movie is still more inspired on the James Bond movies nevertheless. There are a bit too many similarities this time to call it a coincidence.Not only does the movie feature all kind of odd gadgets again and is the villain once more portrayed in a Blowfeld kind of way but also for the first time the movie is set at different places and the main character travels to exotic locations. But there also are some small other similarities such as in the camera handling the portrayal of women as sex objects fist fights with henchman checking the room for bugs and an underwater sequences.Peter van Eyck who also starred in the previous movie Scotland Yard jagt Dr. Mabuse reappears in this movie only in a different role this time. In Scotland Yard jagt Dr. Mabuse he played Major Bill Tern. while in this movie he plays Maj. Bob Anders. Sort of makes you wonder why also since he basically plays the same sort of character in both movies. Also funny thing is that Wolgang Preiss is being credited in this movie the man who played Dr. Mabuse in the previous five Dr. Mabuse movie but he never actually appears in this movie at all.Not only the fact that this movie tries too hard to be a like a James Bond movie makes this movie a quite bad one to watch but also its story. Seriously what is this story all about? Also most of the other Dr. Mabuse movies had a quite silly main plot but because of their entertainment values and camp elements none of it really mattered. This movie just never really becomes interesting or engaging and also totally lacks any of the thriller elements all of the other previous Dr. Mabuse movies still had. On top of that Dr. Mabuse himself is hardly ever featured in this movie and the story concentrates to much on Maj. Bob Anders while most of the other Dr. Mabuse movies still concentrated on Dr. Mabuse's criminal master plans.Quite a dreadful movie to watch.410httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Todesstrahlen des Dr. Mabuse is a German blackandwhite film from 1964 so this one is already way over half a century. It runs for slightly under 1.5 hours and looking at the crew list you will see that actually quite a few people worked as writers and directors here. The outcome for that is quite disappointing so it is probably a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. But there is another major problem here namely that this film delivers zero creativity as a standalone movie. It is a bit of everything that was popular around that time in Germany a touch of Edgar Wallace Rialto films a touch of James Bond the death ray obviously and a touch of Mabuse and the older films about the criminal mastermind. The only thing missing is probably Winnetourelated stuff. But there is absolutely nothing in here that somehow warrants the film as a standalone creative achievement. It is also a waste of actors even if Gert Frbe isn't on board this time. Peter van Eyck is a much better actor than he is allowed to show us here for sure and he is just as forgettable as the rest basically. The script is very forgettable. Every time the film seems to head in a direction where it could actually made an impact it is thrown back by random Mabuse references and honestly this film could have turned out clearly superior without the evil doctor being in the center of it. but I guess it is the name that lured so many people into cinema so they did not want to do without it. It cost them as by today's standards the film has not aged well at all. I'd say the rating here on IMDb is accurate but then again it is not worse than several previous Mabuse films. Still maybe a good thing the series came to a halt for a while after this one as the subject honestly had been overdone by then. Also the more frequent inclusion of color in the coming years may have hurt the franchise but you could almost say helped as they could not mess it up any further. So yeah I don't think The Death Ray of Dr. Mabuse and there are several other titles out there for this one is a failure or anything but it is a film that is basically just a collection of stuff that had been done better and more originally on other occasions. I don't recommend seeing it. Thumbs down.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unknown and tragic Western with unexpected final and ordinary actors as Vince Edwards and important appearance by the great Jack Palance who does an excessive playing . Passable Western in which Civil War deserters ravage the Old West  it packs sad atmosphere  wonderful musical score and spectacular outdoors . It deals with a family whose father named Parson Galt Jack Palance is leader a violent bunch similarly to QuantrellBill Anderson's guerrillas  they are burning buildings  grisly raids  torching planted fields and shooting down livestock to deprive northern people of food  fodder and support . Parson's men rode out in a little town and most of buildings were burning including all businesses his raiders looted indiscriminately and robbed the town's bank . The film is set during American Civil War when the eldest son named David Galt Vince Edwards decides the massacre needs to stop . David murders one of his own soldiers by accident during an attack and he is detained and condemned to death in a family run court . Anyway Edwards getaway after fighting his brother Jacob George Maharis  both of whom hate until death since one of them committed a crime . David goes to Texas turning his name and living the good life with a spouse Sylvia Syms and a newborn. The exgunman hopes to settle down with his wife and son  but his old enemies have other plans for him . In Texas only sheriff Neville Brand  knows Edwards' new identity . And his visions of a quiet life are doomed by the reappearance of enemies from his past . David is taken prisoner and is humbled  beaten shot before he either changes certain elements of his character or learns the secret necessary to ultimately get revenge . Later on  there takes place a spectacular struggle between David and Jacob on AustinFort Bend train .Here is a thinking person's Western with elements of Greek tragedy that deals with one exguerrillero who also is unable to shake his past and whose ultimate goal for taking root again is impeded by killing and subsequent vengeance . Acceptable twilight Western with interesting dialogue  splendid cinematography by Sam Leavitt and memorable musical score by David Whitaker . This CainAbel Western results to be a typical story with Spaghetti influence in which blends the common scenarios  as vengeful and tough antiheroes  difficult and fast showdowns and raids with numerous deceases  some quick zooms and habitual Spanish scenarios . The mixture of action and drama is well balanced . Watch out for the final duel it's outstanding for a Western with unexpected resolution . The revenge as main theme might be usual for this genre but with all these dreamlike flashbacks about his mother from the key character it's a fresh look . Good main cast as Vince Edwards and overacting by Jack Palance  the support cast is full of good British actors as Sylvia Syms  Kate O'Mara and Christian Roberts . Besides good set decoration and art direction by Jose Alguero  filmed in Spanish studios and of course 'Almeria' and Las Rozas  La Pedriza  Madrid . Levin shows a dark depressing and sadly realistic face of the west. In fact the entire movie is a drama of characters and family confrontation . But watching the film you would be able to feel how Levin equates victory with redemption . This violent western well produced by Irving Allen and professionally directed by Henry Levin failed at Box office  however  nowadays is best considered . Exactor director Henry Levin was a previous stage player who had a prolific and long career as filmmaker entering the directing in 1943 about every genre over the next 36 years . His heyday was in the 1960s  when he turned out several bright and frothy sex comedies notably Belles on their toes  Come fly with me  Honeymoon hotel  his greatest films were on the adventure genre as Genghis Khan  The wonderful world of Brothers Grimm  The bandit of Sherwood Forest  The return of Monte Cristo and Journey to the center of the earth . Although Levin's forte was light comedies one of his most interesting films was a dark brooding western Lonely man 1957 and Desperados  both of them with Jack Palance. He finished his career piloting madefortelevision movies and died on the final day of shooting Scout's Honor 1980 TV. If you are looking for Westerns with action  violence but also story and atmospheric scenes Desperados should be for you.".

This might be a joy to some viewers but a tad unrealistic if not at times irritating here is also out of context. For sure there are some highly exciting set pieces unusual camera angles another Italian influence with some rare aerial shots. Together with some death defying stunt work but as a whole comes across as somewhat contrived. More emphasisinput was needed on the script acting story and a little subtlety would have been greatly appreciated. 'Desperados' simply tries to hard without the necessary class but on the other hand is a nice little exploiter for an extensive an ever growing western collection.".

	schema:reviewBody "What could have been an interesting tale of marauding renegade Confederates out for revenge becomes a slapdash tawdry mess of a film.  Ringleader Palance a former parson! and his sons Edwards Maharis and Roberts along with a huge gaggle of violent rebels blaze a path across the southwest frontier robbing raping and burning anything in their midst.  It's all because their own loved ones were brutalized when they were out killing Union soldiers on a raid.  Finally Edwards decides he's had enough and he and his wife Syms start over in a new town with an assumed name.  They also have a son.  However it's only a matter of time before the relentless Palance and his band of unmerry men make their way to this heretofore quiet town.  Edwards his svelte muscular days as a posing strap model long behind him gives an exceedingly wooden performance.  His character's motivations rarely make sense because of the weak script and because it's never really clear what he's thinking!  Outfitted with Elvisstyle porkchop sideburns he mostly stares blankly and expressionless at the events around him unless constipation can be considered an expression.  At the other end of the spectrum is Palance who mercilessly overacts with an abandon not likely to be found anywhere outside the movie Mommie Dearest.  His ungodly performance has to be seen to be believed.  Inexplicably drawing out certain words and syllables screaming at the top of his lungs and throwing overthetop tantrums every few minutes he is a profound embarrassment. Maharis is given little to do as the middle son but Roberts as the youngest son gives Palance a run for his money in the ham acting department.  It is excruciating to watch Roberts mug and cajole incessantly through the film.  O'Mara pops up rather briefly as a lame hooker ! who hobbles around everywhere when she ought to be doing her job.  She finally gets a little more to do near the end.  Brand turns up as the rotund but caring Marshall of the town Edwards has settled in.  He pays for his friendliness with a sound beating.  The lovely and talented Syms is FAR out of place in a movie this crass and tasteless.  She provides the one ounce of class that the picture has.  The sets look like something that Bonanza would reject as inauthentic the camerawork is distractingly busy the editing is choppy to say the least and the music is alternately abysmal and inappropriate.  On good thing the film has going for it is a series of pretty decent action sequences.  Some of the raiding is arrestingly done and there's a nifty scene onboard a moving train.  The dynamic of the son turning against the father and having a fateful reunion could have been a great one but unfortunately there were too many weak elements involved to sell it properly.  Another oddity is the prevalence of British actors in the cast playing Americans.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a real shame because there was potential for a truly compelling story here and then you have a reliable director and Jack Palance on board. Is The Desperados the worst western of all time? No. Is it a terrible film? Not quite that bad? Was it a bad and disappointing film that could have done much more with what it had? Yes.The Desperados has three or four main things that keep it from being unwatchable. The scenerySpanish? is absolutely beautiful while showing off some gritty atmosphere too and the costumes and sets are equally handsome and in keeping with the film's tone. Sylvia Syms brings a lot of elegant class in a film that has very little of that otherwise. There are some decent action sequences here with the truly exciting scene on the train faring the best. Lastly there is a very atmospheric bleak climax that is so powerfully executed that one wishes that it came sooner and lasted longer.Vince Edwards however is very wooden and spends his entire screen time looking numb. Don't expect Jack Palance to save the film as much as I very much like Palancehe was also the main reason for watching his performance in The Desperados is one of his worst. He has shown numerous times that he can be lots of fun when 'hammy' and overthetop and this was the kind of role that Palance should have been perfect for but like in Justine he has hammed up in a way that takes one out of the film and because everything else is taken so seriously here that was the case with his performance here. The rest of the cast including an outofplace Kenneth Cope don't register and are further saddled with very onedimensional and dull characters and very unnaturalsounding and severely underdeveloped dialogue.With the story it was a great idea and could have been compelling but is let down by some sluggish pacing very abrupt tone and story shifts that give the film a constant messy feel and scenes that are either not always relevant and go on too long or because of the tastelessness in serious need of more subtlety. The direction is workmanlike and gets the job done but that's the best it gets in other parts it's either static leaving extras standing like confused lemons or in desperate need of more reigning in the direction of the actors. Although the scenery costumes and sets are great the editing is often very sloppy and while some camera angles are unusual and interesting others get too busy and give the film a distractingly overblown look. The music does have some energetically bombastic moments but a vast majority of the time it's ridiculously inappropriate sounding more 1960s romance than Civil War western.In summary there are a few things that are just enough to make The Desperados a onetime viewing but much of it despite its potential is a pretty desperate mess. 310 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " One of the worst movies I ever saw";
	schema:reviewBody "Absolutely one of the worst movies I ever seen. Unlike Plan 9 From Outer Space this movie is not one of those so bad they are funny or good flicks. Why? Because it takes itself too seriously. And the production wasn't shoddy and because of the well known actors. Jack Palance who is one of my favorite actors but tends to have bouts of hammery really pours it on. He plays the father of a a marauding confederate gang obviously a take on Quatrill raiders but only because the are a violent gang and they are confederates. For some reason I see a resemblance with John Brown. He is bible spouting father who is actually a Parson the trouble between the brothers which happened with John Brown. But even though Hollywood tends to portray Brown as a madman as Jack Palance is in this movie in reality he wasn't. Because of those reasons I do think they were not really basing this gang on Quantrill raiders but on John Brown and his sons! The movie Che the other worst movie of all time was next up for Palance what was he thinking? Vince Edwards is the son who decided to break off from Daddy Dearest and the Boyz. I am just going to say he pays for it. George Maharis plays one of the brothers. Both are good as Sylvia Syms who plays Vince Edwards wife. Vince Edwards was actually very good. A very quiet and nice performance but then Mt St Helens would look quiet next to Palance. I forgot how much I liked him and how we lost him too early. But it is Palance's performance which needs to taught in all acting and movie schools on not how to act that is in the center of this movie and does it suffer for it. Lastly the music was so inappropriate it sounded like it came from another movie..a romance movie. I never heard so many flourishes in my life. It was just as bad as Palance was. I do not understand how a actor can have such bad performances but then turns right around and does work that will knock your socks off. No other actor has the knack for doing that. It is like he knows some of these flicks are stinkers and acts accordingly. Avoid this movie if you can. It side swiped me early one morning and I continued to watch because I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I gave it 3 stars because of Vince Edwards good performance otherwise it would of have gotten a 0.".

	schema:headline " You always did have the wrong kind of guts!";
	schema:reviewBody "There's only one reason to catch this Western and that's to see just how far over the top Jack Palance can take it. There are times though when even he gets to be too embarrassing as in a scene late in the picture when he does a drunken jag while holding his grandson hostage. He's just totally crazed and manic at that point which makes me wonder now whether he was really on a drunken jag while filming. I guess we'll never know but man he was really out there.If one has any sense of America's Civil War history you'll probably recognize elements of the Quantrill Raider legacy in this story of Josiah Gant Palance leader of a vicious band of rebels even the Confederacy doesn't care to acknowledge. The opening scene is reminiscent of the Quantrill raid on Lawrence Kansas in 1863 but in this case the location is given as St. Thomas Kansas and the marauding gang is nowhere near the size of Quantrill's bunch. When it occurs Galt's oldest son Davey Vince Edwards has an epiphany of sorts he begins to realize just how vile and dangerous his family is. The father's murderous nature extends to David's brothers Jacob George Maharis and Adam Christian Roberts.A quick flashback scene of Davey's dying mother telegraphs the finale but even though her vision of the future calls for the family members to destroy each other one wouldn't expect the ending to be as final as it was for all concerned. However it did leave a question mark over the fate of Jacob a quick cutaway of the fight between him and Davey aboard a train left his fate inconclusive. But if you go with the premise all the Galt's were goners.Keep an eye on the scene when Jacob and Adam are in jail fully expecting Davey to bust them out. When Davey skips out the bars of the jail cell actually move when Jacob shakes them. They probably could have walked out any time they wanted.There must be something about the word 'desperado' to assign the kiss of death to movie Westerns. A 1943 film titled 'The Desperadoes with an 'e' starring Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford also comes up short in the way of telling a story. But that was twenty five years earlier than this one so you can cut it some slack for the writing. Not only that but it's a little shocking to see Neville Brand in this film as a federal marshal  I've never seen him so fat!".

It was filmed in 1968 in Spain with an American and British cast and an American director. However the hysterical approach to the material proves counterproductive and the film is appallingly directed and choreographed with actors falling over for no obvious reason or otherwise standing still and waiting for things to happen to them.An example of director Levin's ineptitude is when Palance and his gang raid a Texas town in order to rob the bank. After shooting up the place a while some of the gang members dismount and enter the bank to rob it. Inside the bank people are still at tills being served by cashiers as if nothing is happening! The same thing happens in the opening massacre when the Union soldiers are still emerging from their tents to be easily shot several minutes after wholesale gunfire has been raging nearby.Matters are not helped by the fact that all prints are heavily censored. The opening massacre based on Quantrill's massacre of Lawrence Kansas suffers from several obvious censor cuts  for example as Palance is about to shoot a group of men lined up against a building there is an abrupt cutaway and we hear only a single shot dubbed over the face of Vince Edwards  and is extremely choppy as a result. A scene towards the end between Palance and Kate O'Mara is also heavily cut.In the face of this ineptitude some ripe overacting by Palance and the actor who plays his youngest son is the only thing left to enjoy.".

As an official military observer Steidle had access to parts of the country that no journalist could penetrate. Ultimately frustrated by the inaction of the international community Steidle resigned and returned to the US to expose the images and stories of lives systematically destroyed.

	schema:reviewBody "The most important aspect about The Devil Came on Horseback is its images simply for the unfortunate fact that no one really has seen anything properly documenting the brutality going on over there. There's been sporadic text every now and then and even a picture or two but by and large the waves in the press about Darfur are merely ankle busters compared to this film's tsunami of pictorials and video displaying the absolute horror of that region of Sudan.The film follows Brian Steidle a man who's entire career has been militarybased. He served as a USMC captain and when he would no longer see combat he left the military and accepted a contract position in Sudan with the Joint Military Commission where he would be an integral part of the NorthSouth ceasefire rising the ranks from a team leader to senior operations officer. After seven months he was invited to Darfur where he would serve as an unarmed military observer and American representative for the African Union in that region. This film documents his findings as an observer.What he found was systematic ethniccleansing genocide. The Sudanese government was not only enabling the mass extinction of its citizens it was controlling it. The devil in the title of the film are the Janjaweed nomadic blackArab militia groups who massacre entire villages by exterminating its nonArab black African inhabitants and literally burn the tribes' homes to the ground. They are paid in plunder and are notorious for raping their female victims castrating their male victims and torturing them all.The Janjaweed have been more adequately equipped and become a far greater threat since nonArab groups the Sudan Liberation Army and the Justice and Equality Movement have risen up against the Sudanese government for its mistreatment of its people. Although the government of Sudan has repeatedly denied any assistance to these barbarous raiding bandits this film has been a breakthrough of evidence showing quite clearly the government's involvement.To really understand this film however is to understand its tragedy. No one is really doing anything about this. Even after Steidle came back and lobbied before congress in an effort to call the United States to action his plethora of images and video were dismissed as nothing more than inconvenient casualties in another statesponsored genocide that we're unwilling to involve ourselves in. Sure they were acknowledged and Colin Powell called it what it wasa genocidebut there's still over 450000 dead and counting and 2.5 million displaced.I could describe to you the images I sawthe maiming and killing of men women and children their eyes gouged out and their bodies burned castrated and mutilatedand how I reacted emotionally with tears of hopelessness and regret when I saw this film. But instead I think it far more powerful for you to go see this film for yourself. Then perhaps you'll want to take action and help let our government know that you want it to take active involvement in stopping this nightmare. It's not enough to talk about it and acknowledge that it's happeningwe need to take active measures in preventing the perpetuation of these government sanctioned massacres.Remember just as you've read this review in the comfort of your own home or office or wherever the killing in Sudan continues. And it won't stop until every last one of the nonArab black Africans are dead or when and if someone steps in and takes appropriate action to stop it.".

Even after Steidle came back and lobbied before congress in an effort to call the United States to action his plethora of images and video were dismissed as nothing more than inconvenient casualties in another statesponsored genocide that we're unwilling to involve ourselves in. Sure they were acknowledged and Colin Powell called it what it wasa genocidebut there's still over 450000 dead and counting and 2.5 million displaced.I could describe to you the images I sawthe maiming and killing of men women and children their eyes gouged out and their bodies burned castrated and mutilatedand how I reacted emotionally with tears of hopelessness and regret when I saw this film. But instead I think it far more powerful for you to go see this film for yourself. Then perhaps you'll want to take action and help let our government know that you want it to take active involvement in stopping this nightmare. It's not enough to talk about it and acknowledge that it's happeningwe need to take active measures in preventing the perpetuation of these government sanctioned massacres.Remember just as you've read this review in the comfort of your own home or office or wherever the killing in Sudan continues. And it won't stop until every last one of the nonArab black Africans are dead or when and if someone steps in and takes appropriate action to stop it.";

	schema:reviewBody "This amazing film screened at the SXSW Film Festival and was extremely wellreceived. The film is a remarkable picture of the tragedy that is unfolding in Africa and being ignored by both America and the rest of the world. The story is told thru the eyes of former American Marine Captain turned international monitor Brian Steidle. Steidle is the reluctant hero drawn into the events of Darfur almost by accident. As his eyes are opened to the ugliness of what is happening in Darfur he opens our eyes as well. The photographs are amazing and nightmarish. The tragic message is that we haven't learned from the Holocaust and more recently Rwanda is also clear and deeply haunting. This film is significantly better made than the somewhat amateurish film although still interesting and informative Darfur Diaries. It is filmed with both heart and skill. Steidle who has also written a book by the same name is the perfect guide to draw us out of our apathy and into the heart of this deep unfolding tragedy. His palpable feeling of anger and helplessness as he watches genocide is palpable and heartbreaking. The film is also an indictment of the failure of the US and other Western governments to act to address this humanitarian crisis that has been unfolding now for 4 years. The U.S. has called these events genocide but has done nothing substantive to provide for a UN peacekeeping force to address the tragedy. This is the type of film that must be widely scene if Americans are to awaken from their slumber and respond to this horror of murder rape massacre slaughter and dislocation that is being committed by Sudan's government against its own citizens. Perhaps there is still a chance to save even more people from dying if Americans are willing to pay attention to what is happening. I hope that Americans take the time to see this important and compelling film about the greatest tragedy of our times.".

I'd imagine if you're like me you've heard the stories and been peripherally aware of the situation for years now. So what turns someone from one who sits on their couch and thinks God that's awful to someone who writes this email and gets involved? A simple answer I saw a movie this weekend. It's called The Devil Came on Horseback. It's a documentary that details the ongoing conflict in the Sudan. Make no mistake though we hear little about it anymore the atrocities continue. Since 2004 approximately 2.5 million Sudanese have been displaced and 400000 killed.In DC the movie is playing at the Avalon Theater on Connecticut Avenue in NW. It's the only place in the area where the movie is showing. If you live outside the DC area you can go to www.thedevilcameonhorseback.com for theaters and show times in your area. The film is to put it mildly disturbing. The images shown will be forever burned on to the IMAX in my mind.It's as if the ethnic African Sudanese people have been forced into slavery. Now that word has a lot of power and most would suggest that it's foolish of me to use it but in essence that's what's going on. Not in the same sense as Africans were enslaved in this country but slaves nonetheless. Slaves to the corporations who would rather protect profit than people. Slaves to their own government who defend and enrich only themselves. Slaves to the outside influence of countries who covet only the resources they can export not the resources inherent in the humanity of those who reside there. Slaves to the circumstances around them over which they have no control and from which they have no escape. And it's time it stopped.They say those that fail to understand history are doomed to repeat it. History is repeating itself. Let me ask you this.... If you could go back to the 1930's and stop the Holocaust before it happened would you? What about the ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia? The genocide in Rwanda? We're too late to stop this before it starts but we can help put an end to it before any more lives are uselessly wasted.So why am I writing this? Because perhaps naively I believe that a small group of dedicated people can change the world. And what am I asking of you? See the movie. If you can't see the movie and I know most of you have busy lives jobs and other things that will probably keep you from getting to the theater go to www.savedarfur.org or www.glabalgrassroots.org and donate 10 the cost of a ticket. I know asking for money is the fastest way to get people to hit the delete button but you should know that 100 of the charitable partner proceeds earned from the film go to Global Grassroots www.globalgrassroots.org a nonprofit charity that helps Darfuri refugees and Rwandan genocide survivors rebuild their lives. Think of it this way it's one less drink when you're out one night or two less trips to Starbucks this week or month.The reason this movie affected me so is I looked at those people and saw my friends and family. The dead and displaced are someone's mother or father brother or sister or child. What would you do if they were yours?".

	schema:reviewBody "In the early 2000s a cease fire was declared between two warring factions in Sudan the Arab Muslims in the north and the nonArabs in the south effectively bringing to an end the bloody civil war that had ripped that nation apart for over two decades though the peace treaty itself was not officially signed until 2005. Former Marine Captain Brian Steidle went to the country as part of a team sponsored by the African Union to help monitor the cease fire. However while he was there a new conflict broke out this time in Darfur the far western region of Sudan that is largely inhabited by tribal blacks. As soon as the cease fire was in place militias and death squads backed by the Arab government in Khartoum began a wellcoordinated and systematic campaign to brutally terrorize and slaughter the inhabitants of that region. Whole villages and refugee camps were wiped out their people mowed down burned alive or left to die of starvation all for being black. Steidle  sans weapons and armed only with a still camera a video recorder a great deal of personal courage and a spirit of righteous indignation  spent much of that time traveling through the countryside compiling a photographic account of the atrocities. The Devil Came on Horseback is that account.With this work filmmakers Ricki Stren and Anne Sundberg clearly hope to rouse the outside world from its lethargy regarding this tragedy. Steidle's heartbreaking and compelling eyewitness testimony to Man'sinhumanitytoMan is placed in direct opposition to the lipservice platitudes and hollow assurances he receives from the fiddleplaying leaders in the Bush administration and the U.N. when he confronts them with the evidence. First there is the resistance on the part of the world to declare that what was happening in Darfur is a genocide at all  then after the admission an intransigent refusal to step in and take any kind of action to halt the holocaust. Perhaps the most heartrending moments come from interviews with survivors living in refugee camps in neighboring Chad and from reflective comments made by Steidle himself as he struggles with the enormity of what he's seen and experienced and battles against the frustrating reluctance on the part of those who could actually do something to ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING.After all the horrors it shows us after all the inspiring images of one caring man making a difference in the world the movie turns the spotlight directly onto the viewers challenging them to take an active part in helping to end this human tragedy. Thus the movie concludes with a list of websites and telephone numbers where all concerned people can go to find out more about what they themselves can do to have an impact. It's a challenge well worth taking up.".

	schema:reviewBody "A very eye opening and hard hitting experience viewing this film. I do feel that it falls short on delivering the back story and facts to truly understand exactly what is going on and why in this region. To my benefit I had already seen the film Darfur Now which does a way better job describing the where's what's and why's of this hole situation. Darfur Now doesn't have anything close to the experiences and the photographs taken by Brian Steidle. Basically what I'm saying is that watching both these films together will give you the complete picture of this tragedy. A couple of things Brian Steidle said in this film really hit me hard first when he described his feeling about taking pictures from the hill top over looking a village and hes says if I would have had my rifle instead of my camera I could have prevented the deaths of so many people. I can't imagine what it would feel like to have that kind of training and then be put in a situation were you can't us it to help.

	onyx:emotionText "A very eye opening and hard hitting experience viewing this film. I do feel that it falls short on delivering the back story and facts to truly understand exactly what is going on and why in this region. To my benefit I had already seen the film Darfur Now which does a way better job describing the where's what's and why's of this hole situation. Darfur Now doesn't have anything close to the experiences and the photographs taken by Brian Steidle. Basically what I'm saying is that watching both these films together will give you the complete picture of this tragedy. A couple of things Brian Steidle said in this film really hit me hard first when he described his feeling about taking pictures from the hill top over looking a village and hes says if I would have had my rifle instead of my camera I could have prevented the deaths of so many people. I can't imagine what it would feel like to have that kind of training and then be put in a situation were you can't us it to help.

Rest assured that I do care about Darfur but I can't escape the fact that this documentary is not really about Sudan it's about a person  Brian.Brian volunteered to be a military observer in Sudan to observe the cease fire of 2004. He witnessed many of the horrible events that happened that year. Many photographs were taken. Many are damnable of an uncaring Sudanese government. We are shown a few but not enough. The film is very disappointing in that respect. It gives reason to those who claim that Brian's dossier does not constitute a strong enough case.The first half is a rough chronology of Brian's stint in Sudan. It is described in words. What is on the screen is a random assemblage of footage that is flashed without context. Sure dead bodies are dead bodies burning villages are so kids do play ball Brian folds his tent etc. The problem is that this material is edited so poorly that it becomes a mess of images. There is no focus. Images and words are often disconnected. We are quite often not sure what we see.The editing improves when Brian goes to Chad. Finally we get a cohesive narrative that holds together visually. The short visit to Rwanda is also properly handled.Overall it is a disappointing documentary. A missed opportunity to build a stronger case for saving Darfur and also a disservice to the work Brian has done to expose the crimes that are being perpetrated. The excessive focus on Brian and less on his photos ends up painting this as an ego trip.".

	schema:reviewBody "When he finished in the field with the US Marines Captain Brian Steidle turns away from a desk job on his way up the ranks and instead takes a job as a military observer of the ceasefire in Sudan. The access he is able to have within the country ultimately leads him to be in no doubt that he is seeing Governmentbacked genocide against the African citizens of Darfur. With no weapon but his reports and his photographs Steidle charts all that he sees in villages razed to the ground. This film charts his growing frustration at the lack of movement that this approach seems to create.Normally I would criticise those who praise a film for its subject rather than judge it on the basis of the film itself. Normally this film would be one of those and on these terms I would not be as kind to it as it really deserves. The reasons for this are clear from watching the film because really it could have been better structured and delivered. I thought the film would use Steidle as a device to explore the subject but somehow it tends to make him the subject too many times for my liking. This is a niggling irritation and it is not helped that the delivery of the subject is structured around his experiences  which is not always the most effective way of doing it because it does not build the case in the manner that would be most impacting and informative.Having said that though it is difficult to watch the film and not be moved and sickened because of the subject and because most viewers will have seen so little of what is happening in Darfur. The photographs are disturbing and graphic. Whether it be charred remains or humans with eyes gouged out it is not easy to sit and watch without reaction. The lack of intervention is also difficult to watch and this is the one aspect that the focus on Steidle contributes to well because he feels the frustration firsthand.Overall then this is a compelling and sickening film but it is nearly despite the film not because of it. The structure is not strong enough and the focus on Steidle distracts and detracts as much as it adds  it should have used him more as a way in rather than the centrepiece of the film but these are minor complaints versus the shocking truths that the film puts in front of us. The images are sickening so is the lack of action and the exposure the film gives to the subject is worthy of praise and makes this worth seeing even if it could have been better.".

Regarding nonfictional documentaries I think that if too much focus was given to make the movie aesthetically pleasing rather than getting the message across the film would become somewhat discredited. It would imply that the directors and producers of the film put more stress on making a name for themselves in Hollywood than giving a meaning to the movie and making audiences aware of the event.That's how The Devil Came on Horseback was it was more of an actual documentary than a movie. But because none of the pictures of films were dramatized it actually had more impact than other movies that did you know that when you watch this that this is the real thing. However I got the feeling that it documented more of how the Sudanese government was trying to suppress information about what's happening in Darfur than on what's happening in Darfur itself. It also described a lot about how Brian's journey in trying to spread awareness about the genocide and get the government UN International Criminal Court to take action. I suppose whether it's good or bad is up to the audience and what they're looking for. This was a good documentary but I thought that I should have focused more on the genocide itself. However it did shed a lot of light on how governments are very reluctant to act on something if it doesn't involve them even if there is a moral obligation especially if the government in question is the United States the current world superpower. It also showed how nonbinding the UN truly is there have already been two arrest warrants for the president of Sudan yet non of the countries AlBashir visited were willing to arrest him and extradite him. Despite this however there were a scenes of anger Sudanese officials and citizens denying the genocide in the Holocaust museum grief mostly the interviews of the black Africans targeted by the Janjaweed who told their stories of suffering and scenes that urged us to take action.Overall I do recommend this movie but not if you are looking for facts regarding the genocide in Darfur but rather a fellow reporter finding it hard to get his story out or to get people to care about his cause.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Tote aus der Themse or Angels of Terror really? is a West German movie from 45 years ago and it is one of the later additions to the Edgar Wallace series. I have seen some of these films but I personally must say that they are mostly quantity over quality unfortunately. The crime cases are rarely interesting and I am almost never tempted to make guesses who the killer is and this is really everything that the films rely on. The characters are not written particularly convincingly but just as means to the story. The music is over the top. About this one here I would almost say the somewhat comedic scenes at the slaughterhouse were the funniest because it is all so mediocre and forgettable in terms of the drama and crime stories. The cast has a couple famous names here. Uschi Glas was a big star back then and this resulted in a somewhat unusual occurrence for these Wallace films. I am not speaking about the fact that she plays two characters in here but that she has so much screen time that she can almost be seen as a bigger lead than Hansjrg Felmy. She is also firstlisted in the cast. Werner Peters and Vadim Glowna could also be known to older German audiences as they both had really long careers. But this quality cast cannot turn this script into a decent crime movie either. I give it a thumbs down.".

Irony is all over the place subtle references to Frankist Spain are obvious to those who know what they should look about but everything serves the purpose to have a good laugh even if you have to actually think about the film to do so.The second part is not as funny but I almost wet myself while the aspiring director Bergmanwannabe shoots a number of scenes with his utterly talentless wife imitating every last cadre of a Bergman film! To sum this up If you are not annoyed by ample nudity I have to say this since IMDb is also accessed by... ahem... cultures not quite fond of nudity you like witty the Spanish way humor and you are a bit of a Bergmangeek does such an animal even exist??? you are going to adore Torremolinos '73 as I did.Probably the best comedy by far...

	schema:reviewBody "Set in 1973 Spain  dealing with a marriage who takes advantage of an offer to make adult films . As Alfredo Lopez Javier Camera is married to Carmen Candela Pea  hairdresser and faithful wife . When it starts to go wrong his job selling encyclopedias at home  then the head of sales  Don Carlos Juan Diego comes up with an idea for a new product line . The company will expand its catalogue to offer an audiovisual encyclopedia of human reproduction  essentially 8 millimeter films of couples making love . As they are presented with the opportunity to make money doing erotic films in Super 8 which is exported to Scandinavia in the form of a false encyclopedia about reproduction in the world . Carmen agrees mainly because she has recently lost her job in a local beauty parlour . The act turns him into an aspiring legit filmmaker and her into an international sex symbol . Being inspired by true events .A good script with comedy  drama and fine players as Javier Camera and Candela Pea . This entertaining as well as interesting Dramedy contains crazy events  nudism  sexual scenes  amusement and absurd situations . Sitting in a strange middle ground between the completely absurd and the stylish set pieces  including various nostalgic moments  paying tribute to music and films of the seventies . It is a crazy Spanish comedy with touches of drama that offers no intellectual stimulus whatsoever  though it has some fun and hilarious moments . Humor is sometimes cheesy and grossout with numerous naughty and picaresque situations such as sex jokes  adultery  jealousy  and erotic scenes . It partially sets the tone of the times in the seventies when had been made lots of films about nudism or Destape. In fact  this film belongs to a nostalgic subgenre regarding the eroticism and nudism on the mass during the thunderous 70s such as Dias De Cine by David Serrano and Los Aos Desnudos Clasificada S by Dunia Ayoso and Felix Sabroso . Behind this title hides a story based on real events with its director Pablo Berger makes her special tribute to cinema  with references to Bergman  the Spanish comedies  even porn. But not only accomplishes that  shows that there are many ways to do comedy without falling into vulgarity. It is an acceptable production plenty of nudism and sexual scenes  but is saved by an intelligent as well as unpretentious script with several very funny scenes . All this is achieved by comedians like Javier Cmara and Candela Pea they are the perfect combination to get laughs and tears  at the same time .It stands out the nice acting from Javier Camera as a struggling encyclopedia salesman become porno actor and charming Candela Pea as his wife who really wants to have a child . The picture provides a passel of brief or cameo appearances such as Malena Alterio  Marivi Bilbao  Mximo Valverde  Jaime Blanch  Mariano Pea Ana Wagener  Ramn Barea and special appearance by Carmen Machi . Evocative cinematography by Kiko De La Rica  one of the best Spanish cameramen who has photographed great titles as Lucia Y el Sexo El Calentito  Witching and Bitching  A Sad Trumpet Ballad The Oxford crimes  Snow White  among others . Lively as well as adequate musical score  plenty of wonderful songs  by Nacho Mastretta  a good professional who has composed soundtracks in a lot of famous movies such as El Gran Vzquez 2010  Va a Ser Nadie Es Perfecto 2006 and La Hija Del Cannibal 2003 . The motion picture was well produced and compellingly directed by Pablo Berger  a very good Spanish movies director . A very worthy debut that demonstrated how with simple jobs can make a splendid film . The flick delivered a successful result and achieved various Goya Awards . Director Pablo Berger developed the project for some years before being able to shoot it . Pablo is a well recognized filmmaker both nationally and internationally  and in proof of it he won many prizes in several Festivals  as this his feature debut Torremolinos 73  as well as the excellent Snow White or Blancanieves . Rating  Above average  essential and indispensable watching for Spanish cinema fans .".

This entertaining as well as interesting Dramedy contains crazy events  nudism  sexual scenes  amusement and absurd situations . Sitting in a strange middle ground between the completely absurd and the stylish set pieces  including various nostalgic moments  paying tribute to music and films of the seventies . It is a crazy Spanish comedy with touches of drama that offers no intellectual stimulus whatsoever  though it has some fun and hilarious moments . Humor is sometimes cheesy and grossout with numerous naughty and picaresque situations such as sex jokes  adultery  jealousy  and erotic scenes . It partially sets the tone of the times in the seventies when had been made lots of films about nudism or Destape. In fact  this film belongs to a nostalgic subgenre regarding the eroticism and nudism on the mass during the thunderous 70s such as Dias De Cine by David Serrano and Los Aos Desnudos Clasificada S by Dunia Ayoso and Felix Sabroso . Behind this title hides a story based on real events with its director Pablo Berger makes her special tribute to cinema  with references to Bergman  the Spanish comedies  even porn. But not only accomplishes that  shows that there are many ways to do comedy without falling into vulgarity. It is an acceptable production plenty of nudism and sexual scenes  but is saved by an intelligent as well as unpretentious script with several very funny scenes . All this is achieved by comedians like Javier Cmara and Candela Pea they are the perfect combination to get laughs and tears  at the same time .It stands out the nice acting from Javier Camera as a struggling encyclopedia salesman become porno actor and charming Candela Pea as his wife who really wants to have a child . The picture provides a passel of brief or cameo appearances such as Malena Alterio  Marivi Bilbao  Mximo Valverde  Jaime Blanch  Mariano Pea Ana Wagener  Ramn Barea and special appearance by Carmen Machi .

	schema:headline " Softcore Porn for 'Camera Buff'";
	schema:reviewBody "When I first watched this film in 2005 I loved it although at the time I was perhaps ready to agree that the second half of the film stumbles in a lot. But having recently seen 'Camera Buff' by Krzysztof Kieslowski I am absolutely convinced 'Torremolinos 73' was inspired by it in one way or another. This is not to deny originality to Berger's creation but the acquaintance with the Polish film can seriously help understand and evaluate 'Torremolinos'. It can let us appreciate some details compare for instance a cameo appearance of another Polish filmmaker Zanussi in 'Camera Buff' to the everpowerful presence of Bergman's loudspeaker in 'Torremolinos' but most importantly it allows to see what exactly the subject of the film is. If our understanding is not informed by 'Camera Buff' then 'Torremolinos' is a vinaigrette of politics porn and arthouse cinema. If it is then the main topic is exactly the one that makes the film somewhat 'heavy' in its second part and which was one of the central topics in Kieslowski's film. Cinema becomes a wedge which is hammered between the routine and creativity. Aspiration to make 'serious' films and the cherishing of a film as one's child violently confronted the parental responsibilities of Kieslowski's protagonist who gave in to creative impulses. The conflict in 'Torremolinos' is slightly reversed in that cinema becomes a more complex agent it is the reason for misunderstanding but it also unveils the problem and in the end even helps to resolve it. It is nevertheless the importance of the choice and its connection to various problems concerning family life that bring a kind of dullness into the second part of 'Torremolinos'. In this case it might be useful to agree with those who call this part 'subtler' in comparison to the upbeat start. In particular this second part contains an easilyunnoticed topic of how much insult the male pride can take and whether or not it is worth being guarded when love is at stake.".

	schema:reviewBody "Where to start with Torremolinos 73? The style is oldfashioned kindly farce with some very cheerful and silly sexscenes. It might have strayed into Billy Wilder acidity like Kiss Me Stupid but prefers to be defiantly optimistic about human nature. I really rate this film for its gentle goodhumour its love for its characters and of movies in general. The director Pablo Berger has succeeded in satirising the early 1970s its mindsets and quirks from a distance of thirty years which isn't too easy. And the references are exactly those that obsessed us all in the early 1970s. The first part lays out how an encyclopaedia salesman is finessed by his boss into making sex films with his wife under the pretence that they are for the Copenhagen Scientific Research into Sexuality Institute or some such. The inhibited averagelooking which is the point and very broke couple find the financial benefits much to their taste but she's not so keen in being recognised in public by strange foreign men. The wife Carmen Candela Pea also wants a baby but husband Alfredo Javier Cmara is firing blanks. Meanwhile Alfredo has discovered his inner auteur. There are some very funny sequences of titillation Alfredostyle with Carmen rather resigned to it all.. After he pens an epic script entitled Torremolinos 73 he and we are surprised when his boss goes ahead with the project insisting however on an upgrade to 35mm and a support tech crew from Scandinavia of course. Part two consists of the shooting of Alfredo's script which steals from the plot of Durrenmatt's The Visit at Torremolinos. The Scandinavian crew can't quite believe they're working on this project but young Magnus Mads Mikkelsen with blond hair is thrilled to be there and clearly even more thrilled to meet the wife perhaps he's seen the research films in Scandinavia? Alfredo's script of course can't help but pay homage to The Seventh Seal chess and beaches various bits of Fellini dwarves yet Antonioni barren landscapes and possibly even Jean Cocteau's Orphe Carmen in her suit and flat hat resembles either Maria Casares as the PrincessDeath or a young version of Helena Rubenstein  take your pick. One of the pleasures of this film is the bizarre costuming for Carmen's research films and for the movie within a movie. Clearly this husband is not as buttoned down as he appears. For me the funniest bits are of Carmen and Magnus roaming the landscape for the cameras she in her severe suit and shovel hat and he as Death in cloak and scythe. They play chess on a pedalo run up and down beaches take rides on the merrygoround and eventually get to the climax of the film within a film. And Mads Mikkelsen is hilarious in the small but pivotal role of Magnus delivering a sweet natured character who manages to keep a straight face and his dignity enveloped in cloaks scythes and sex scenes. I've missed telling you the joke with the horse too rude but very funny. There's a happy ending of course. And a movie is born. Go see.".

In the 1970 film it is the son who finds out the life of his late father his hidden secrets. Still I found the older movie much more appealing in terms of the plot itself but also in terms of the direction also. It is obvious that a good plot estimulates direction but still this one could have been better. It has from times to times the quality seal from Bertolucci but in general it's not as good as others. The end is very delayed the film could have less 20 minutes that it would be better to watch. Some beautiful images along the time as usual in Bertolucci but than again somewhat meaningless as they are not many times in the context of the story.Though the film touches some important issues such as terrorism in Italy's 1980'. Also interesting in exploring how a man can 'use the blood' of his own son just to get himself out of a difficult financial position. Not much more than this. It's worth watching if you like Bertolucci or if you have special interest in italian cinema. But don't judge the director just on this one. It is unfair specially if we think that his second film after this one was The Last Emperor...".

There's nothing as stylish as there is in his great film THE CONFORMIST there's no Marlon Brando as the last American in Paris as there is in TANGO there's only a whollyrealized work full of quiet daring. Ugo Tognazzi a veteran of Italian film and theater is Primo Spaggiari a cheese factory owner in Northern Italy who accidentally witnesses the kidnapping of his only son.Flanked by his glamorous French wife played by the accomplished Anouk Aimee his son's radical sexy girlfriend played by the talented Laura Morante and a priest who seems capable of anything actor Victor Cavallo... the drama unfolds. A cloud of mystery hangs over the autumnal landscape. A director who made his career an Oedipal quest in search of the father now turns his gaze around... the father searches for his son.Bertolucci working with his actors and aided by veteran cinematographer Carlo Di Palma who made his name working with Michelangelo Antonioni RED DESERT and BLOWUP transforms the countryside of Emilia where he's from and the estate with the factory into a vast theater of contemporary Greek tragedy. The stunning shot of large cheese wheels in the factory refrigerator that Spaggiari refers to as his Fort Knox Spaggiari's bicycle ride across the city of Parma that is a small time capsule of postwar Italian cinema and the beguiling ending are scenes that alone would make this film worth seeing. I've watched this film a number of times at repertory cinemas on television and on old VHS. It grows with each viewing. Something new to see or discover every time I watch it and WATCHING is one of the various themes of this film. It's a major crime that such a film is not on DVD or Blu ray in North America. A hearty thank you to Bertolucci for this superb work his most underrated film.".

A director who made his career an Oedipal quest in search of the father now turns his gaze around... the father searches for his son.Bertolucci working with his actors and aided by veteran cinematographer Carlo Di Palma who made his name working with Michelangelo Antonioni RED DESERT and BLOWUP transforms the countryside of Emilia where he's from and the estate with the factory into a vast theater of contemporary Greek tragedy. The stunning shot of large cheese wheels in the factory refrigerator that Spaggiari refers to as his Fort Knox Spaggiari's bicycle ride across the city of Parma that is a small time capsule of postwar Italian cinema and the beguiling ending are scenes that alone would make this film worth seeing. I've watched this film a number of times at repertory cinemas on television and on old VHS. It grows with each viewing. Something new to see or discover every time I watch it and WATCHING is one of the various themes of this film. It's a major crime that such a film is not on DVD or Blu ray in North America. A hearty thank you to Bertolucci for this superb work his most underrated film.";

Alfonso Cuaron who was later tabbed to direct the 3rd Harry Potter movie really showed his stuff in this film which in my opinion was largely overlooked as I don't remember a whole lot of publicity being done when it was first released which is a shame because a lot of effort went into making this such a good movie.

Rarely does a film completely draw you into it's world and grab hold of your emotions like this one.  The imagery and design elements are remarkable. The passages from India are mystical and powerful the use of green throughout the design elements is inspired and helps create this world of wonder seen through a child's eyes. Even though we can guess the ending it still manages to wring you dry of tears before the final lovely silent movie fadeout. A pure delight from beginning to end!  this must be seen on DVD to fully appreciate the design elements".

The passages from India are mystical and powerful the use of green throughout the design elements is inspired and helps create this world of wonder seen through a child's eyes. Even though we can guess the ending it still manages to wring you dry of tears before the final lovely silent movie fadeout. A pure delight from beginning to end!  this must be seen on DVD to fully appreciate the design elements";

	schema:reviewBody "I have loved the book A Little Princess for most of my life and was very excited that there was a movie. But I was appalled at this adaptation. Not only is the acting wooden and the plot a convoluted mish mash of various incidents in the book but the theme is all wrong. The real theme of the story should be that a girl can be a princess only when she behaves like one as Sara does when she gives 5 of her 6 buns to a beggar child even when she herself is very hungry. The theme of the movie seems to be that all girls are princesses which cheapens Sara's actions considerably and seems more like it should be written on a Hallmark card than applied to this story.There are many other things wrong with this movie too many to list but here are just a few of the larger ones This story should be set in Britian in the mid 1800s not America during the first world war. Miss Minchen is harsh to Sara from the start making her actions when Sara is left penniless much less startling than they would be if she was syrupy sweet at the beginning as she is supposed to be. Nowhere is it mentioned that Becky is black. Sara's father does not come back he is dead. It is his closest friend and collaborator in the diamond mines who finds Sara and restores her to her proper place. In fact the diamond mines are not even mentioned at all though they are the source of Sara's wealth.All through everything that Sara has faced she always acts like a Princess giving what she can and forgiving those who hurt her. She would never have called Lavinia a snotty two faced bully. Such a thing is completely out of character for her and undermines the entire philosophy that she is to be well behaved no matter what.This is by far the worst adaptation of a book to the screen that I have ever seen with the notable exceptions of Ella Enchanted and Anne of Green Gables the Continuing StoryThe plot of the book is wonderful and skillfully written so I do not understand why the director felt that it needed to be changed to make it interesting. I would suggest that anyone wishing to know this story should watch the 1987 version which is far superior. Or better still read the book. It will be more worth your time than the hour and a half wasted on this version on the movie.".

However when it came out I remember thinking it was one of the biggest wastes of money and time I've ever spent at the cinema.In principle the acting the sets and the music were excellent and are the main reason why I'm rating this a 4. The other nice thread Disney picked up out of the book so far they're the only ones is Sara's storytelling.In this version Sara is a little too selfsacrificing for my taste. There is no way she would have deliberately lied to Miss Minchin just to stop her punishing the other girls in the book she makes a point of describing lies as not just wicked but vulgar. There's also far too much of a Disneyfied ending for me Sara's father coming back from the dead and having his amnesiabrain fever cured simply by seeing his little girl and all of them trotting off into the Indian sunset. While the book does have a happy and critics might say equally improbable ending it doesn't leave you thinking Oh puh leeze.However to be perfectly fair Disney isn't the first one to do this ending instead they ripped it off from the Shirley Temple version. Still infuriating to watch why couldn't they have ripped off the BBC ending if they had to rip off anyone? but I suppose it's marginally better than having them just rewrite the book.About the only things true to the book were1. Sara's father being a soldier 2. The lines between Sara and her father Are you learning me by heart?No. I know you by heart. You are inside my heart. 3. Sara's friendship with Becky and her 'adopting' Lottie although this last one wasn't developed as much as it could have been 4. The changing of her room by adding various luxury items. That part was brilliantly done. 5. The basic core  a rich girl being flung into poverty suddenly  is there but that's about all that is.People might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience. Possibly. All I can say to that is I have two cousins  aged 7 and 12 respectively  who were big fans of this film until they read the book.If all you want is a 'feelgood' family film then this delivers. If you're looking for a film that actually tells the story of A Little Princess in fact if you've read the book don't waste time with this one. It's such a shame with a cast like this if they'd stuck to at least the basic story it could have been fantastic.Am I harping on about 'read the book' this and 'read the book' that a little too much? Very probably. But if someone attempts to adapt a book  especially such a classic  into a movie then they should at least have done the same thing. I was led to believe this was an adaptation of the book not a remake of the Shirley Temple version.".

Sara's friendship with Becky and her 'adopting' Lottie although this last one wasn't developed as much as it could have been 4. The changing of her room by adding various luxury items. That part was brilliantly done. 5. The basic core  a rich girl being flung into poverty suddenly  is there but that's about all that is.People might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience. Possibly. All I can say to that is I have two cousins  aged 7 and 12 respectively  who were big fans of this film until they read the book.If all you want is a 'feelgood' family film then this delivers. If you're looking for a film that actually tells the story of A Little Princess in fact if you've read the book don't waste time with this one. It's such a shame with a cast like this if they'd stuck to at least the basic story it could have been fantastic.Am I harping on about 'read the book' this and 'read the book' that a little too much? Very probably. But if someone attempts to adapt a book  especially such a classic  into a movie then they should at least have done the same thing. I was led to believe this was an adaptation of the book not a remake of the Shirley Temple version.";

Unfair crap happens and it's how we RESPOND that matters.In the book Sara Crewe had dignity and character. She took it on the chin and maintained her personal dignity.

She DOES stand up to Miss Minchin. She tells the truth and is not cowed by her. But she does not do the stupid spiteful things that the Sara in the film does.It's really rather unsettling to me that so many here say they loved the book and they love the movie. I can't help but wonder... did we read the same book? The whole point of the book was personal responsibility behaving with honor and integrity ALWAYS telling the truth and facing adversity with calm and integrity.Sara has a happy ending in the book  not the ridiculous survival of her father but the joining with his partner who has been searching for her. In the book she is taken in by this new father figure who loves and cares for her and Becky. And Miss Minchin is NOT a chimney sweep  that part of the film really was stupid.To see all this praise for this wretched film is disturbing to me. We are praising a film that glorifies petty spiteful behavior with a few tips of the hat to kindness? Sara in the book was kind to the bone and full of integrity. I don't even recognize her in the film... she's not in it.Good thing Mrs. Burnett isn't alive to see this horrid thing. It's ghastly and undeserving to bear the title of her book.".

The book is splendid  this film is an awful adaptation.In the book Sara is honorable kind strong and NEVER does anything spiteful to get back at anyone. That's the POINT of the book! She behaves as a princes regardless of circumstances. An important part of behaving like a princess is to not return unkindness. It is to behave honorably regardless of how you are being treated.In the book she endures much and touches the lives of others. Other people change their behaviors after they witnessed her kindness and ability to endure without sinking to spite and vengefulness. Sara does what is right simply BECAUSE it is RIGHT.Outside of the bakery she comes upon a beggar girl who is more poor and hungry than she is. She has half a dozen hot buns. She is VERY hungry. She gives one bun to this wild looking little girl huddled on the doorstep of the bakery. When she sees how ravenous the girl is and watches her gobble the bun she gives her another. She continues to do this until she has given 3 or 4 I think  I don't remember how many.The baker is watching through the window. She is so moved by what she has witnessed she takes the beggar girl in and raises her as her own daughter. Other people are similarly influenced by Sara.And in the book her father has died. The man next door is her father's partner  he has been looking for her. Her father did not lose his money after all  the man is thrilled to find Sara he takes her and Becky into his home and raises them as his daughters. And Sara has her full inheritance of course.Miss Minchin is not a chimney sweep. In fact she remains in her same post at the school. But she is humiliated as Sara has told her new guardian of the cruel treatment she received. And Sara does speak to Miss Minchin in the end  Miss Minchin is trying to minimize her treatment of Sara and Sara with a calm steadfast demeanor instructs Miss Minchin that she had been cruel.There is no comeuppance for Miss Minchin. She continues on in her miserable existence. It does not matter  what matters is that Sara has a home with a guardian who loves her  and her dearest friend in the world Becky is now for all intents and purposes her sister.The book is about love and honorable behavior under the worst of circumstances. It is about self control and humility. It is a wonderful book. This film does NOTHING to capture the true story and messages of the book. My wife was so disgusted with it she wanted to leave the theater in the middle but we decided to stick it out. We were not rewarded.I cannot for the life of me think of a reason the film makes should alter this excellent book in such a bad direction. Perhaps it was the influence of the ghastly screenplay from the book that Shirley Temple acted in. I don't know  but this film is so far from the book in character and values that I do not recognize it.Don't waste your time  buy the book. It is unforgettable... even for a dad!".

From the very first moment when a tiny spec of colour blossoms from the dark screen to form a scene from one of Sara's stories it is positively captivating. As a film it is an enduring work worth more than the sum of its parts. Indeed all aspects of the film work together seamlessly. The script is excellent and the cast is strong. Liesel Matthews provides a sensitive and emotional performance as Sara Crewe her wide eyes alternately filled to the brim with passion or achingly desolate. Vanessa Lee Chester provides a strong performance as Becky and Eleanor Brom's calm calculated performance prevents Miss Minchin's character from becoming caricature.Emmanual Luzbeki's cinematography is stunning and artistic. The soundtrack is charming and the scenes are filmed artistically with a level of openness and approachability that is much to be commended. A dream sequence in the middle of the film where Sara sees neighbour Ram Daas in the house next door and dances to the drifting snowflakes is a triumph in artistry. The banquet scene with its sumptuous miseenscene is made resplendent with the joy exuded by the talented young actresses.As an adaptation it is a powerful piece though it strays from the novel it is done so tastefully in the style of the novel and the climax is both heartbreaking and incredibly heartwarming.A Little Princess is precisely the type of movie every child should watch and every adult. It goes to the heart of what it means to be human to suffer to live graciously to love to take joy in the small things and to take comfort in each other. It is a magical experience and completely satisfying to watch. After seeing this film you would have to be heartless to forget it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Irezumi which means tattoo in Japanese is an erotic costume film from one of the bad boys of '60s Japanese cinema. Director Masumura used a full palette of primary colors with very vivid reds to tell us about the story of Otsuya a beautiful young woman from a middleclass merchant family who is abducted into geisha work and who catches one day the eye of Seikichi a tattoo master who marks her back with a huge monstrous spider. From that moment on Otsuya will take her revenge with every man who shared her bed.If you have an appetite for perverse stories try this one. To play Otsuya Masumura used beautiful actress Ayako Wakao best remembered in the West for her part in Mizoguchi's Street of Shame 1956 where she was Yasumi the coldhearted and moneygreedy prostitute. She inspired Masumura throughout the '60s and Irezumi is one of their best collaborations. Adapted to the screen by Kaneto Shindo the internationally acclaimed director of The Naked Island and Onibaba the script goes far beyond Junichiro Tanizaki's original short story. In Tanizaki's work a sadistic tattoo artist searches for his ultimate canvas a beautiful girl to create his masterpiece. The girl is innocent until the tattooer finishes pouring his soul into her tattoo which represents a huge tarantula it is better to know that tarantula in Japanese is jorgumo and jor stands for prostitute as both attract men to suck their blood. She becomes thus the femme fatale of his dreams. In Irezumi we never know if Otsuya is evil by nature or if the tattoo is the cause of her misconduct and bad manners and that's the most fascinating aspect of the film. As it is a pinku eiga of the '60s don't expect graphic sexual scenes but highly suggestive shots which are more than enough and enjoy this shameless film. As for me I still haven't decided yet whether it is a misogynous film or its complete opposite. And what about the spider? It's a... uh very special piece of art.".

For reasons that elude me the Japanese have taken quite an affection to their idea of the deceitful femme fatale the spider woman. Here the feisty daughter becomes one quite literally by having a grotesque spider woman tattooed by force on her back on orders of the pimp she's sold to. While her lover prowls the red districts of Yoshiwara looking for her she leads a luxurious life as a geisha by scamming people off their money with her pimp as an accomplice.

When people get killed it's ugly and messy. When they don't they weave around them webs of lies and deceit or find themselves caught in one.Masumura's assured but laconic direction no tracking shots no moving cameras  his camera remains locked on a tripod with the occasional imperceptible pan is a masterclass in missenscene careful framing and pacing a movie without calling attention to his work as director. Simply put the guy knows how to take a great shot and he knows how to pile great shots one upon the other to make a great scene and he knows how to orchestrate his scenes to make a great movie that moves effortlessly from start to finish. Add to that the superb editing and some great acting by Ayako Wakao gorgeous in the lead role and you've got yourself a proper forgotten gem from the classic epoch of Japanese cinema. I'm looking forward to catching more of the director's work.".

What she can do though is take revenge and hey does she take revenge.

While mainstream American films focus too much on the latter producing mostly fun but forgettable flicks and Russia for instance is known for tediously known snoozefests with Europe being mostly hitormiss and the Chinese film industry being contaminated by propaganda Japan has an immensely diverse cinematic tradition with countless gems like this one. Yasuzo Masumura's Irezumi Tattoo may not carry a strong underlying moral or a message but instead the beauty lies in its mood and style perfectly balancing the line between seductiveness and dark violence.It's based on the novel by Jun'ichiro Tanizaki who also wrote the literary basis for Masumura's slightly more famous film Manji. Irezumi is scripted by Kaneto Shindo director of Onibaba and Kuroneko and stars Masumura's muse Ayako Wakao in one of their many many collaborations. This is essentially a revenge tale with some erotic undertones and acting which ranges from excellent to downright cheesy. Another thing about it that's a bit uneven are the murder sequences some of which are badly put together while the others are truly painful bloody and disturbing as it's intended.The main character is a morally ambiguous femme fatale who gets kidnapped into geishahood and gets a tattoo of a tarantula with a human face tattooed on her back it's worth noting that the Japanese word for tarantula is jorogumo joro standing for prostitute as both Wakao's characters and tarantulas are bloodthirsty. The Shakespearean romantic story and the increasingly dark atmosphere wonderfully come together in the film's striking climax. The cinematography is wonderfully realized but hurt by the foggy print quality. The movie is really begging to be restored.".

Lucky she was available! Seems that Judy Garland was unable to go on and had to be replaced by Ginger who was relaxing at her farm in Oregon. The script by Betty and Adolph Green had to be revamped to suit Fred and Gingerand the result is pure gold! Rumors had it that Judy wasn't too happy about being replaced and gave Ginger a hard time by showing up on the set. None of the strain shows in Ginger's performance.By no means is the storyline a new onebut the manner in which Fred Ginger Oscar Levant Billie Burke and others play it is what makes the film so watchable. And the singing and dancing numbers can't be faulted. Fred has his solo routine with Shoes With Wings On a number by the way which would have been impossible to perform on a real stage as he does here but things like that never bothered filmgoers in the '40s. Ginger and Fred have a fine time with their 'My One and Only Highland Fling' routine in kilts with brogues and join forces for an elegant version of 'They Can't Take That Away From Me' in formal attire which  for me at least  was the highlight of their team effort. Acidtongued Oscar Levant has plenty of chance to dazzle too with his nimble piano work on 'Sabre Dance' and even joins the two for A Walk in the Country which gets the story off to a jaunty start.Though Judy's fans missed the opportunity to see her again with Astaire after Easter Parade nobody was disappointed with the results. For their fans this was their only chance to see Fred and Ginger together in a Technicolor musical with no expense spared. The results were Grade A entertainment.Ginger's Sarah Bernhardt recitation has become a camp classicgood for laughs! The less said about it the better. Nevertheless it's easy to see why Astaire welcomed her back with open arms.".

	schema:reviewBody "For their reunion and final screen pairing Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers were teamed again by MGM in The Barkleys of Broadway. They play a pair of musical comedy performers who do have their occasional spats off the stage.One thing Arthur Freed at MGM did for the pair was give them a better and more mature story to work with than they ever did at RKO back in the Thirties. That was part of the charm though you didn't really care about the silliness of the plots with music written by folks like Kern Gershwin Porter and Berlin.As in real life Fred was the creative one of the pair and he's criticizing Ginger a bit too much at times. So much so that she's very receptive to French director Jacques Francois's overtures to star in a straight dramatic play about young Sarah Bernhardt. This presents quite the dilemma for Fred in his professional and personal life.Harry Warren and Ira Gershwin wrote the score for The Barkleys of Broadway. I like very much the song You'd Be Hard To Replace it so fits Fred and Ginger for singing and dancing. Creative continuity was established with the RKO films as They Can't Take That Away From Me which was introduced in Shall We Dance and written by Ira and George Gershwin sung and danced elegantly here. It's one of my favorite ballads ever.Oscar Levant is his usual laconic and witty self here who inflicts the Saber Dance on party guests and later does Tschaikovsky's Concerto in B Flat in the grand and classical style. Levant's reputation as a wit overshadows his very real skill as a pianist but not in this film. Also his close association with the Gershwin brothers gives some more official continuity with this film.I suppose Fred and Ginger could have done more films together but I suppose that in The Barkleys of Broadway they left their fans on a high note. They'll never dancing partners like them ever again.".

Sadly this would also be their last film together but it is quite the send off for these dancing legends. The film written by Betty Comden and Aldoph Green SINGIN IN THE RAINfollows a Broadway song and dance team named Josh and Dinah Barkley who are at the peak of their careers but Dinah feels like she's suffocating from Josh's Svengalilike grip on her career and decides she wants to become a serious actress. Of course this story does parallel what happened with Astaire and Rogers ten years earlier when Rogers yearned to become a dramatic actress and actually won an Oscar the following year for KITTY FOYLE. The road to their inevitable reunion is predictable and as for Ginger's interpretation of some French play the less said the betterbut the teams dancing is still spectacular even after ten years away from each other. Their comic duet in Scottish kilts Me One and Only Highland Fling is a delight and Fred's solo Shoes with Wings On is brilliant even though realistically this number would be physically impossible to do in a theater as it is presented here but I digress. And their final dance to They Can't Take That Away From Me is one of the loveliest pas de deuxs ever filmed. Not up to par with SINGIN IN THE RAIN or THE BAND WAGON but classy entertainment with that beloved MGM gloss.".

It is up to Ezra Millar Oscar Levant composer and close friend to act as their referee. Dinah feels Josh takes her for granted while Josh finds Dinah neglectful towards him with instances finding Josh literally left out in the cold on a patio during a social function given by Mrs. Livingston Belney Billie Burke and later at the golf course waiting for Dinah's arrival only to remain there until he gets himself drenched from a sudden rain storm each due to Dinah's meetings with playwright Jacques Francois who insists she's wasting her time in musical comedy and should pursue a dramatic career and become another legend like Sarah Bernhardt. At first she turns down his offer to star in his latest play but after Josh belittles her she decides to take the challenge splitting up the team and causing the Barkleys partnership to go their separate ways.The Music and Lyrics by Ira Gershwin and Harry Warren The Swing Trot danced by Astaire and Rogers The Sabre Dance piano solo by Oscar Levant You'd Be Hard to Replace sung by Astaire Bouncin' the Blues instrumental My One and Only Highland Fling sung by Astaire and Rogers A Weekend in the Country sung by Astaire Rogers and Levant Shoes With Wings On sung and performed by Astaire Concerto in B Flat Minor by Tchaikovskypiano solo by Levant They Can't Take That Away From Me sung by Astairedanced by Astaire and Rogers by George  Ira Gershwin You'd Be Hard to Replace sung by Astaire from phonograph record and Manhattan Downbeat danced by Astaire and Rogers.Supporting casts consists of Gale Robbins as Shirlene May Dinah's understudy Clinton Sundberg as Bert and George Zucco appearing briefly as the judge in the play portion of the film.For their tenth and final collaboration of Astaire and Rogers on screen The Barkleys of Broadway could very well have been a sequel to any one of their earlier efforts showing what's become of their characters after dancing to a happy conclusion. SHALL WE DANCE? 1937 comes to mind since it introduced one of their signature tunes They Can't Take That Away From Me only this time having Fred and Ginger dancing to it resulting as being one of the most moving and sentimental dance pieces ever recorded on film illustrating the chemistry and magic they had over a decade ago is still quite evident in 1949. After many musicals the genius of Astaire never ceases to amaze with his creativity particularly the Shoes With Wings On number one of the true classics in movie musical history. As for the dance numbers with Astaire and Rogers during the opening and closing segments it a wonder why they're so brief.While screen reunions usually fail to recapture the magic of the good old days The Barkleys of Broadway is no exception. The writers had wisely avoided reliving the past for them with the typical boy meets girl plot that had become standard with most Fred and Ginger musicals. However the film offers supporting players in the likeness and manner of those who have enacted with the team in the past. Billie Burke and Jacques Francois could easily be true reminders of GAY Divorce 1934 costars Alice Brady and Erik Rhodes although Hans Conried seen briefly as a waiter comes close as the Rhodes prototype. Edward Everett Horton might have been most welcome in the Levant role but as far as it goes new and younger faces of MGM players assumed center stage instead.Astaire's character comes as a little sarcastic at times which he is supposed to be thus offering him new direction from those easy going dancing guys he's portrayed so well and often. Rogers appears more youthful during the film's latter portion and although a fine comedienne her Sarah Bernhardt interpretation reading of La Marseillaise comes off as a bit forced. And then there's the droll and dry yet sometimes amusing humor of Oscar Levant whose piano solos slow down the pace making one yearn for Chico Marx in piano playing to these classical compositions with his unique and lively style instead.In spite of its pros and cons this is a satisfactory conclusion for Astaire and Rogers partnership offering viewers a chance in seeing them together again dancing on stage one last time on screen as the Barkleys of Broadway.Displayed on video cassette since the 1980s and later to DVD The Barkleys of Broadway at 109 minutes is one of the more revised classic films broadcast on Turner Classic Movies. 12".

It's also made in 1949 why not up the ante a little bit? Our favorite dancers perform in color and are established as a married couple for the first and only time although they eventually get married in two of the RKO films. So what's the thought here do the critics want Astaire and Rogers to be young forever? People grow up even on screen. In fact when I watch the dance of 'They Can't Take That Away from Me' it feels like I'm watching an exhibition from live television rather than a movie musical television was a new medium at the time but curiously a medium that Astaire and Rogers never performed in together. The dance is lovely but almost I don't know cold. But maybe this is how a former screen team performs 10 years after the fact they are 38 and 50 respectively and harbor enough magic to saunter off stage with Rogers' head tilted downward and excite an audience into applause as if they've been watching THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW. It's extraordinary that ten years after Rogers remade herself doing straight awardwinning drama and Astaire remade himself as a solo performer and a man who could dance with just about anyone they could settle back into one more film and not have one strain of foot or hair out of place. MGM formula and Oscar Levant aside it's a very nice way to end a professional marriage.".

	schema:reviewBody "O.K. so it's not up to par with other Fred and Ginger movies but it IS entertaining and their song and dance numbers are great especially when Fred sings They Can't Take That Away From Me and the dance with the number that they perform is the best number they ever danced together but the making of the film was not that easy.Originally the film was written for Fred and Judy Garland but not quite into rehearsals as Fred put it in his autobiography Our Judy got sick and finally it was decided to recast Ginger in her role. There was a wise crack about Fred and Ginger together on the screen that Fred gave Ginger class and Ginger gave Fred sex and of course this wise crack was taken the wrong way but if you think about it Fred was never a Cary Grant so dancers like Cyd Charisse and Ginger Rogers did make Fred look sexy on the screen. In Fred Astairs autobiography he states that after Betty Comden and Adolph Green gave their interpretation of their material that they felt they would have a hard time passing them up 'cause they were known for giving these readings better that the actors and actresses who finally got the parts but Judy Garland couldn't complete the film and Fred Astaire stated that they really wanted to do this together because of their success together in Easter Parade so after deciding to pull in one of their old hits They Can't Take That Away From me for their reunion they began to slightly revise the script for Ginger.I remember as a teenager that the movie was given the big build up that this was the first reuniting of Fred and Ginger since their last movie and the great thing was that it was in Technicolor. I remember seeing the big campaign for the movie in Life Magazine and since I was taking tap dancing lessons Dad took us to the Palace Theatre in downtown Cincinnati to see it. I also remember during the World War II seeing Gene Autry on the stage at the Palace Theatre here in Cincy singing and promoting War Bonds. Yee Gads! Am I really that old today? Of course during the filming Judy Garland visited the set acting like a Virago and Ginger Rogers escaped Judy's madness and disappeared in to her dressing room until after they quite frankly had to force Judy Garland out of the sound stage where they were filming the movie but then Judy Garland did the same thing to Betty Hutton on the set of Annie Get Your Gun but I know this is going off on a tangent thank God Judy Garland didn't play Annie in the movie version. She would have stunk up the joint! Betty Hutton was far better for the role except for maybe Betty Grable who wanted to play Annie in the worse way but 20th wouldn't loan her out.Anyway even though basically Barkleys is slow moving in some of the parts of the movie altogether it is fine entertainment and it's just a shame that movies like this no longer play on the big movie theater screen because that's how you would see some fine singing and dancing by Fred and Ginger in glorious Technicolor but then watching this proves that they were the finest dancing pair on the screen and for that  no  They Can't Take That Away From Me!".

	schema:reviewBody "I love Fred and Ginger movies. Although the Hays Code made very sure to eradicate obscenity and sex from American movies Fred and Ginger found other ways to express the crackling chemistry between them. I wonder that more people haven't noticed how overt the sexual attraction is between the two actors. For example at the end of Bouncin' the Bluesthe big tap number where they're dressed like Roberta's Hard To Handle number Fred takes a long leisurely look at Ginger from head to toe as she sashays towards him and says Oh God Ginger as they move offstage. Since the music and taps are dubbed you don't hear the real reactions of the actors as they're dancing Ginger lets out a pop! as she hits a move but I imagine Fred said it out loud which accounts for the look Ginger gives him as they go offstage. On a side note that Hard to Handle number from Roberta is all natural taps and music without overdubbing so you can hear Ginger make a few suggestive noises and Fred laughs and hollers once or twice.As a married couple Fred and Ginger are extremely believable. They're so familiar to each other by this time and they exude this quality of utter honesty with each other. The fighting is GREAT and only two people who love each other can yell at each other like that. The kisses are still very chaste and though there are two separate beds for Fred and Ginger they're pushed together reflecting the times Ginger nonchalantly sheds her bra right in front of Fred while changing into pajamas. It comes off as a very easy and natural relationship.My favorite part of this movie is the fact that it's a chance for Fred and Ginger to give their own sendup of what people perceived their relationship to be. They're married so their sexual involvement is implicit people believed they either hated each other or had been sexually involved. They dance just like Fred and Ginger. They're both extremely melodramatic which lends a tongueincheek atmosphere to their fights. Neither Fred nor Ginger were ever so overdramatic in real life so the characters are in a way like funhouse versions of themselves.The dancing is exactly what should be expected from Fred and Ginger sixteen years after their first film she's 38 and he's 50 and they can both still swing it. It seems Fred worked with the small changes to Ginger's figure what was everyone complaining about? She looks stunning the whole movie and every film they did before was represented in the choreography somehow the fall in Highland Fling is the same kind of stunt albeit scaled down a bit as the fall from I'm Putting All my Eggs in One Basket the ultraslow walk from Smoke Gets in Your Eyes is seen at the end of They Can't Take That Away from Me as well as the dancingwhilenearlykissing from Change Partners. It's a nice blend and it shows off everything they can do.Every scene is wellplayed and Ginger proves she is every inch the Oscar winner opposite Fred whose own acting skills are deliciously natural and filled with affection for his leading lady. They have no compunction about getting in each others' faces nor are they shy about expressing their attraction to each other. At the resolution of an argument Fred grabs Ginger and kisses her. She apologizes and he kisses her again a much more natural peck this time that's just cute and one can hear him let out a Hm that sounds like even that little peck knocked him for a loop. Owchamagowch.Some people call Fred Ginger's Svengali. He wasn't and it was nice to see Ginger asserting her independence from Fred which she had done so successfully in real life ten years before. They go through the breakup with real pain but it's evident they never stop loving each other. I love this movie and can watch it repeatedly. There are always new details to discover and it bears repeated viewings.".

	schema:reviewBody "The on screen partnership of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers was among the most celebrated of the 1930s and the pair costarred in a total of nine films between 1933 and 1939. Following 'The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle 1939' the duo parted ways and rumours were abound that their working relationship had turned sour though both firmly denied this. An MGM film entitled You Made Me Love You was originally intended to repair Astaire and Judy Garland as a followup to 'Easter Parade 1948' but the actress' drug problems became both physically and emotionally overwhelming and so producer Arthur Freed asked Ginger Rogers to take the part reuniting her with Astaire after a tenyear hiatus. 'The Barkleys of Broadway 1949' isn't quite up to the 'Top Hat 1935' standards but with vivid Technicolor photography and the undiminished comedic chemistry of its two leads Charles Walters' musical is certainly worthwhile viewing. The story wisely takes into account the ten intervening years since we last saw the stars and notably they open the film already married.John and Dinah Barkley Astaire and Rogers are the toast of Broadway the country's most beloved comedic musical performers. However though their marriage seems watertight on the surface the pair are prone to spiteful arguments over the most trivial of issues Dinah for one feels as though she is taken for granted and wants to prove that she can be a success even without her husband. When a suave French playwright Jacques Pierre Barredout Jacques Franois offers Dinah the lead role in his serious play about great stage actress Sarah Bernhardt she doesn't need much persuasion to jump ship and John is left wondering if his wife still loves him. Oscar Levant provides much of the comic relief as Ezra Millar a classical musician and mutual friend of both husband and wife who despite having a new woman by his side every night is the epitome of a pessimist. Levant performs two classical pieces during the film the most memorable being Aram Khachaturian's breathtaking Sabre Dance.Throughout the 1940s Ginger Rogers had successfully advanced past her foundations in musical comedy and had won a Best Actress Oscar for 'Kitty Foyle The Natural History of a Woman 1940.' In a way 'The Barkleys of Broadway' is about Rogers' own struggles to break free from her cinematic marriage with Fred Astaire and her successful bid to gain respect as a dramatic actress. The film's most memorable musical number tellingly is a nostalgic retread of George and Ira Gershwin's They Can't Take That Away From Me from 'Shall We Dance 1937' though without the context and atmosphere of the original film the number is still a lot less emotional than its predecessor. Shoes with Wings On a fun special effectsdriven comedy number in which Astaire is hassled by an army of feetless shoes is also very impressive. Though 'The Barkleys of Broadway' couldn't possible rival the great musical comedies of the pair's golden period the film provides plenty of enjoyable and undemanding entertainment and works nicely as a bittersweet swan song to Astaire and Rogers' partnership.".

But as much as he resents her for deserting him he can't help but interfere in her career calling her up with a disguised voice and pretending to be her director to offer her acting advice. This turns her career as a dramatic actress around but leads to the possibility of romance between Dinah and Jacques the director whom Fred had been pretending to be with a Cyrano de Bergerac facade. It's obvious that these two will get back together but how the scam is exposed is all part of the fun.In their first movie together in ten years Fred and Ginger appear as if time had stood still. He's gone onto other partners and she's mixed an infrequent musical with mostly comedy or dramatic parts. For what was supposed to be a followup for Fred and Judy Garland after the smash success of Easter Parade came as the reunion that nobody thought would ever happen and one of the most delightful reteamings in film history. You can see the story being a continuation of Easter Parade Josh Barkley tells his wife that he helped her learn everything she knows which having seen Easter Parade just recently is a perfect way to continue the story. But without Fred and Judy there's no need to continue that story and even if Judy had been Dinah Barkley not Hannah Brown the connections would have been obvious.Adding color to the Fred and Ginger pairing enhances their stardom although I certainly wouldn't want to see their 19331939 pairings colorized. But you certainly need color for the Manhattan Downbeat My One and Only Highland Fling and Shoes With Wings On one of the most creative of all of Fred's masterpieces. Fred has a beautiful solo he sings to Ginger You'd Be Hard to Replace and the reprisal of They Can't Take That Away From Me is elegantly staged. Ginger's singing in Highland Fling is a bit off key but she still dances beautifully.Oscar Levant provides some acerbic dialog but when he plays classics on the piano during a few concert performances it is absolutely grand. His best line is a comment about Fred's replacement dance partner Gale Robbins and is one she totally deserves. Carol Brewster made my ears ring as Levant's dizzy date but nothing put me in a bigger tizzy than poor Billie Burke's almost unnecessary contribution as a befuddled matron who may provide excellent parties but provided an annoyance even to her society friends who all seemed to run every time they heard her screeching out their names.When Ginger recites the French National Anthem very over dramatically she sounds like she's imitating Blanche Yurka in A Tale of Two Cities appropriate for Madame La Farge but certainly hammy for a rising Sarah Bernhardt to expect to get away with at the La ComdieFranaise. But that's the only embarrassing scene here with her rehearsals for her straight play very much done like Hepburn's scenes in Stage Door where she must face her inadequacies as a dramatic actress until it hits her how she has to play each scene. It's a shame that with each of their careers still in full swing that this was their last movie together. They did present an Oscar together only a few years later and at any event where they were together it was like Elvis or the Beatles had taken the stage. More than 80 years after their first appearance together Fred and Ginger strike magic more than pretty much any other couple. He may have given her class and she may have given him sex appeal but together they sparkled like the stars in the sky and still make cloudy days a lot better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even when such an iconic partnership like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers are in a film that doesn't showcase their talents as well as their previous outings you can still enjoy the film on its own. That is definitely the case with The Barkleys of Broadway still a good enough film despite lacking compared to their previous films. The story may be farfetched but considering that that component wasn't ever as strong as everything else in their films together that isn't as big an issue. More problematic is Ginger's La Marseillaise scene feeling forced the Weekend in the Country number never shaking off the feeling that it would have been more suited to Judy Garlandthe originally intended female lead this song really doesn't play to Ginger's strengths and some of Ginger's clothes somewhat frumpylooking here not accommodating her lovely figure. The costumes scenery and sets generally are sumptuous and the film is beautifully filmed. The score is lovely too with a sense of whimsy and wit and while there have been more memorable songs in other Fred and Ginger outings the songs are still good. Shoes with Wings On is a charming and goodnatured song that shows off Fred's skills as a dancer very well Bouncin' the Blues is catchy and fun and anybody who want to see Fred and Ginger's dancing and chemistry will find pleasure in You'd Be Hard to Replace. The Highland Fling song is not particularly memorable but is fun to watch the kilts are a nice touch. The dance duet of You Can't Take That Away from Me from Shall We Dance is musically and choreographically in a different league nostalgic and moving it is very effective and doesn't feel out of place at all. The choreography is elegant and sparkling if not with new ideasie. dancing on rollerskates or girls on airplanes and Fred and Ginger's dancing is as poised and athletic as it ever was. Their chemistry is very convincing too. The dialogue is smart and witty with a good amount of heart. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers are great here Ginger may have lost some of her freshness not helped by some frumpy outfits but she is still sassy and beautiful. Fred is wonderfully chirpy and debonair that comes through loud and clear in Shoes With Wings on. The supporting cast give solid performances Oscar Levant brings some amusing touches and a fresh personality while playing the piano brilliantly especially when it's as demanding as Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto no.1though not so much as Rachmaninov 3rd or particularly Brahms 2nd. Billie Burke is charming in her role. All in all very enjoyable though a little disappointing too. 710 Bethany Cox".

Perhaps it was partly the result of a decade since their last film together but it is really tough to place film in the same league as fine films such as TOP HAT and SHALL WE DANCE. It was like the original spark and fun was missing from this film. Probably the biggest problem was the script. In most of their more successful films the plot involves single man Fred meeting and falling for single lady Ginger or viceversa. However in this one they are already married and the bloom has worn off the marriagerealizing they really didn't love each other so much after all! Fans of the team would in many cases be naturally appalled as I was. A bickering and nasty Astaire and Rogers is NOT what we'd come to expect! Apart from the plot the film was a mixed bag. The songs in general were pretty poor and weren't especially memorable though I did like a few numbers such as the one with the shoes and the invisible dancers. For support instead of a best friend for Fred and a best friend for Ginger the old formula there is one shared friend in the form of Oscar Levantwho was one of the brighter parts of the film. While I missed Edward Everett Horton or Eric Bloor from the earlier films Levant was still excellentwith his funny and droll comments as well as his amazing talent at the piano particularly The Russian Sabre Dancewow.So overall the film is pretty goodeven slightly better than average but definitely a step down for the team. Worth seeing but not a film to rush to see and not at all indicative of the team's earlier work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Except this vehicle is nothing like their other films at RKO. This is a MGM musical in the big MGM tradition. The whole thing was an accident. Judy Garland was supposed to have Ginger Rogers' role but her chronic illness made a replacement necessary. Rogers and Astaire have the same old chemistry even if it is a different studio. They play feuding song and dance team Josh and Dinah Barkeley who break up personally and professionally over Dinah's desire to do dramatic acting and Josh's jealousy over who the author of the play is  a flirty Frenchman Jacques. At first Josh says he wants Dinah to fall on her face. But when he sees her actually stumble in rehearsals when he sneaks in to catch a peek he blames it all on Jacques who he says does not know how to direct her. So Josh comes up with a ruse in which he calls Dinah after rehearsals and pretends to be Jacques complete with fake French accent giving her cues on how to improve her performance based on what he has seen. Unfortunately it works too well. Dinah thinks even more of Jacques since he is helping her out with great tips and Jacques is bowled over by Dinah's inexplicable improvement. How will this work out? Watch and find out.Of course MGM spared no expense in the late 40s with the Arthur Freed unit which made this film. There is beautiful Technicolor comedy and masterful piano work from Oscar Levant a great piece of special effects work by MGM and dancing by Astaire in the number Shoes with Wings On in which Astaire seems to be dancing side by side with pairs of tap shoes and a ballroom number in which Fred and Ginger dance to They Can't Take That Away From Me. Fred sang it to Ginger but the two did not dance to it in 1937's Shall We Dance. Finally Ginger's recitation of La Marseillaise when she plays Young Sarah Bernhardt in Jacques' play is a probably unintentional camp classic. Fortunately the French are forgiving people.It was an unexpected reunion but for fans of the big MGM musicals of the period and of Fred and Ginger in particular I would highly recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE BARKLEYS OF Broadway has a script written by Comden and Green for Astaire and Judy Garland as a followup to EASTER PARADE. The script doesn't seem to have been much changed when Ginger Rogers came on board to replace Judy. Ginger having signed a contract with a new studio Enterprise Studios which to the surprise of the industry wound up making very few movies before going bankrupt hadn't done much of anything for about 2 years other than reading possible scripts and was available. Most of the musical numbers would receive a radical makeover though 'A Weekend in the Country' still seems very much like a stroll down the Yellow Brick Road.At the ages of 38 and 50 Rogers and Astaire serve as the oldest couple that I know of to headline a musical comedy and it was probably a good idea to make them an established married pair rather than to repeat the courting rituals of the usual and the usual AstaireRogers musical. Unfortunately the musical numbers are not especially wellintegrated into the plot. Oscar Levant's Tchaikovsky interlude spectacular as the playing is in itself does nothing but kill time as we wait for the emotional climax of 'They Can't Take That Away From Me'. Similarly Astaire's solo with the dancing shoes is impressive but it stops the plot cold immediately after a dramatic turning point Dinah's walking out on Josh. These interludes plus a generally pokey second half stretch the proceedings out to an uncomfortable length.

And most of all one must wonder at the idea of burying the first dance number beneath the opening credits! Decisions don't get any dumber than that.Whatever the movie may have been like with Judy Garland it is laden with the mystic chords of memory with Ginger Rogers as one of its stars. For some reason somebody seems to have had ROBERTA on their minds. The best number in BARKLEYS 'Bouncing the Blues' sees Fred and Ginger dressed in very similar costumes to those they wore in the great tap dance number 'Hard to Handle' from ROBERTA. Where the earlier number is graced by spontaneous ejaculations from Ginger and Fred 'Bouncing the Blues' is burdened by forced recorded interjections from Fred and it's no accident that such echoes are on the final sound track. Also the romantic ballad 'Smoke Gets In Your Eyes' dance ends with Fred taking Ginger's hand as they exit stage right to be met with her loving gaze as prelude to a comedic proposal and acceptance she proposes he accepts in BARKLEYS 'They Can't Take That Away From Me' ends exit stage left with Fred similarly taking Ginger's hand but this time she turns her face down and away from him as prelude to rejecting his proposal to get back together. It's quite effective if you notice it but I'm not sure that many will John Mueller author of ASTAIRE DANCING thinks that the 'Highland Fling' number is a parody of the 'Night and Day' dance from THE GAY Divorce. I've never been able to see that myself. For good or ill the movie centers around the character of Dinah Barkley. That's mostly good though Ginger's turn as Sarah Bernhardt must be the low point of her entire career especially odd for an actress who regularly underplayed her most emotional scenes. However she received the best contemporary notices for the film and would have been considered the most important actor in it by contemporary audiences. The script isn't especially sharp and the musical score is the least of all the AstaireRogers films though this says more about the extraordinary quality of the music from their RKO efforts than it does about THE BARKLEYS OF Broadway in particular for example the song 'You'd Be Hard To Replace' seems to me a lovely tune that is pretty much thrown away in the film. Still it's always great to see the wondrous AstaireRogers pairing and it's nice to have a chance to see them in color. It says everything about the quality of this series that I give BARKLEYS an 8 out of 10 rating though I consider it only the 8th best of the 10 films they made together. There's simply never been anything like them.".

	onyx:emotionText "THE BARKLEYS OF Broadway has a script written by Comden and Green for Astaire and Judy Garland as a followup to EASTER PARADE. The script doesn't seem to have been much changed when Ginger Rogers came on board to replace Judy. Ginger having signed a contract with a new studio Enterprise Studios which to the surprise of the industry wound up making very few movies before going bankrupt hadn't done much of anything for about 2 years other than reading possible scripts and was available. Most of the musical numbers would receive a radical makeover though 'A Weekend in the Country' still seems very much like a stroll down the Yellow Brick Road.At the ages of 38 and 50 Rogers and Astaire serve as the oldest couple that I know of to headline a musical comedy and it was probably a good idea to make them an established married pair rather than to repeat the courting rituals of the usual and the usual AstaireRogers musical. Unfortunately the musical numbers are not especially wellintegrated into the plot. Oscar Levant's Tchaikovsky interlude spectacular as the playing is in itself does nothing but kill time as we wait for the emotional climax of 'They Can't Take That Away From Me'. Similarly Astaire's solo with the dancing shoes is impressive but it stops the plot cold immediately after a dramatic turning point Dinah's walking out on Josh. These interludes plus a generally pokey second half stretch the proceedings out to an uncomfortable length. And there's no ultimate reward for it as the great 'Let's Face The Music And Dance' had been for the overlong FOLLOW THE FLEET.

They perform musical acts written by Fred but Ginger wants to break free and be taken seriously as an actress. Enter respected director Jacques Francois Barredout who casts Ginger in the lead role in his play about the young Sarah Bernhardt. Meanwhile Gale Robbins Shirlene is after a little more from Fred other than being Ginger's understudy. We all know how things will work out especially after seeing Ginger Rogers recite La Marseillaise! Contrary to popular belief this is not the first time Fred and Ginger played a married couple. They were married to each other in their previous outing  The Story Of Vernon and Irene Castle. In this offering the film starts well with a couple of entertaining dances. Sadly the film loses momentum and the songs and dances that follow aren't really up to standard. We watch because it is Fred and Ginger. In fact it is Oscar Levant who comes away with the musical honours with his two piano performances. He also provides some of the better comedic moments with his 'can't be bothered' attitude and his popularity with the ladies. He's with a different woman in every scene  good on him! The highlight from Fred and Ginger's set pieces comes at the beginning of the film as they rehearse a piece called Bouncin' The Blues. It comes just after Gale Robbins has been introduced and at a point in the film where the humour is spot on as Ginger Rogers clearly doesn't take very kindly to her. It's a good beginning to the film and I found myself surprised at how good this offering actually was. Downhill from there I'm afraid. While there are still some occasional funny moments we have to endure some crap  the Scottish number is embarrassing there is a nonsense song about going away to the country which is so obviously ripped off from The Wizard of Oz and designed with Judy Garland in mind Fred's solo in a shoe shop alongside sets of dancing shoes is different but uninspiring and their dance to They Can't Take That Away From Me belonged to an earlier film and seemed pointless and geared towards soppy reminiscence.Overall the film had a typical family musical feel to it as opposed to a Fred and Ginger style of film and I half expected Dick Van Dyke to show up at any moment. If it wasn't for the fact that it is a Fred and Ginger film I would have to consign it to the reject pile. They are a magical couple and their reputation is what just keeps this film above water. Thank goodness for Bouncin' The Blues.".

The painting that is the centre of the whole mystery is very chilling especially in the scenes where Jim meets the new housekeeper and then glances at the picture and sees her in it. The death of the Doctor is very eerie but best of all has to be the very simple scene of Chris lying in bed and hearing a voice in the night calling out Christina... Very creepy especially if you are watching this movie for the first time on late night television and wonder if the sound is on the screen or not! There is also an extraordinary sequence where Jim sees movement outside the house at night and investigates only to be attacked. When he returns to the house the incident is almost forgotten in his bemusement..just like a sort of was it a dream? sleepy kind of unreality. My main reason for liking this movie is that compared to what Hammer were churning out it is different and scary unlike most of Hammer's films and doesn't need to rely on gore. It also predates The Omen and The Exorcist and yet deals with the subject matter intelligently so in a sense it is ahead of it's time. Good stuff...not exactly the greatest movie ever made but effective and successful in its clearly limited ambitions.".

It's a slowpaced bad dream that holds together much better than most old horror movies. Tom Selleck stars as a man who buys a strange painting of a woman who looks like his wife when he gives it to her she starts to remember her past and so begins the violence and nudity.This is one of those good bad horror movies that isn't just about moving from one violent bloodbath to the next... you get to breathe with the characters and ponder the outlandish situation in which they find themselves which only makes it all the more believable. It's like that realization during a nightmare that you're having a nightmare when you try to wake yourself up but you just can't come out of it.Daughters Of Satan is not a great movie by any means but it has it's own illogical occult madness that somehow winds up making sense. I'm prejudiced because I saw the last 40 minutes on latenight TV and spent five years tracking it down to see the entire movie. It was worth it for me anyway...GRADE B".

Directed by Hollingsworth Morse nice name buddy Daughters of Satan was obviously shot on a very low budget and while the plot is cheesy and messy and often lacks logic the film is undeniably entertaining. Selleck plays the American arts expert James Robinson who has recently moved to the Phillipines with his beautiful wife Christina Barra Grant. In an obscure art gallery he stumbles across a painting which shows a witchburning in 1592 Spain. And one of the burned witches happens to be the spitting image of his wife! Fascinated with the coincidence he buys the painting and brings it home henceforth mysterious things begin to happen... As mentioned above logic isn't the strongest point of the film why would anyone keep the painting when it's clear that it's causing trouble and the plot is often messy. Nonetheless this is an enjoyable film that might appeal to many of my fellow fans of lowbudget Horror and Exploitation. There are some really cool scenes in particular the sleazy opening sequence and one fantastic creepy scene involving a painting which I don't want to give away. Interestingly Selleck's role here has some resemblance to the role of Magnum P.I. for which he would later get famous. Barra Grant who plays his wife has a very presentable rack and the film includes a variety of eccentric characters. You haven't missed anything if you decide to skip Daughters of Satan. However it is definitely entertaining and a film that most of my fellow fans of BMovies and lowbudget Horror in particular might enjoy.".

It is irresistible to see a young and studly Tom Selleck in a horror film a Tom Selleck who's already sporting that famous moustache.He plays James Robertson an art expert working in the Philippines who purchases a painting for himself depicting the burning of three witches. One of the witches bears an uncanny resemblance to his wife Chris Barra Grant. And that's just the beginning of the weirdness to follow as both James and Chris start to encounter strange individuals including Kitty Tani Guthrie and Juana Paraluman. Also on hand is eternally jolly Filipino icon Vic Diaz as an art dealer as well as Vic Silayan as helpful doctor Dr. Dangal...not to mention a Rottweiler who's friendly to Chris but who always gives cat man James a hard time.The opening sequence very much lets us know right from the start where this is heading so suspense is limited. This film produced by Aubrey Schenck Frankenstein  1970 Robinson Crusoe on Mars and directed by TV veteran Hollingsworth Morse now there's a name for you is more about enveloping the audience in an appropriately odd and dreamy ambiance. It has some violence here and there and voyeurs will appreciate the breast shots from our leading lady. There's a lot of great scenery to enjoy and a very '70s but effective music score by Richard LaSalle.The movie is an acceptable diversion as far as it goes but it does rather get bogged down in talk sometimes. Still some of the actors especially Guthrie and Paraluman are fun to watch and Selleck is good as the frustrated puzzled hero. Grant is less satisfactory although she does look fine. Plus the movie is worth sticking with just for the kind of downbeat ending common to cinema of the 1970s.If you're a genre fan who loves seeking out obscurities such as this one you should have a fairly good time with it.Six out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the 1970s there were many films shot in the Philippines with foreign actors and this is one of them. The leads were shipped in from overseas for marketing sake while Philippino actors comprised the rest of the cast. The great Paul Naschy made a few such films in the orient during this period as well.This witchcraft film focuses on American couple Jim Selleck and his wife Chris Barra Grant. Jim is an art appraiser who buys a painting not for its value but because a woman in the fresco looks just like his wife. When he shows his wife the paintingthree witches burned at the stake by the Spanish Inquisitionshe finds the painting barbaric but also informs her husband about some obscure witch trial that she has never known anything about. We quickly get a film about reincarnation as the two other witches in the painting are introduced to the couple. They initiate Chris into their coven but her devout religious beliefs are all that can save her.STORY  Rather bythenumbers. There aren't any real twists in the script and the ending is a bit of a letdown. Characterization is also very weak. We never get a real sense of Jim's work and why he is in the Philippines. Also the script should have fleshed out Chris' character more. Jim tells her doctor that she's devout but we never get much of her religious devotion. Okay so she wears a cross on her necklacebig deal. Show her struggling in a foreign land since she is out of place both physically and spiritually.ACTING  Nothing that great here. Tom Selleck is in preMagnum PI mode here and does the best job in this film. It was easy to see why he became a rather big star shortly after this film was made. Barra Grant who has since transitioned to writing and directing gives an uneven performance as Chris. Her character is odd from the beginning but the facial expressions she makesespecially when he analyzes the paintingare quite laughable. Beyond confusion she fails to capture any other emotions. Tani Guthrie does a fine job as the demented Kitty Duarte. She perfectly handles the uninhibited sexpot witch role.NUDITY  The film starts with some rather forgettable nudity as an unattractive Philippino broad is whipped while she's topless by the coven. Later Tani Guthrie tries to seduce Tom Selleck at her abode when she lures him to her house because she has another painting by the same artist who painted his witchcraft fresco. She shucks down and hops in bed but Selleck is true to his wife and spurns her. Then Barra Grant is stripped to the waste by the coven and forced to apostatize. They make her spit on a cross to show her devotion to Satan. It's easy to see why Barra Grant was cast. She may struggle at times conveying emotion but her breasts give an extraordinary performance.".

That's not until after Dr. Dangal gets himself killed in a car accident when is car's breaks were tampered with. SPOILERS The real big secret in the movie has nothing really that much to do with James' old lady Chris and her fellow witches Kitty Duarte  Juana Rios Tani Gutrie Paraluman as well as the Devil Dog Nicodemas who were depicted in the painting being burned along with her. It has to do with the poor confused and not too bright James Robertson himself or his great great great great great grandpappy. It was Grandpa to the sixth or sevent power RobertsonMAJOR SPOILER who was in fact responsible for the witches' deaths! And now some 400 years later in 1972 it's payback time and despite having nothing to do with what happened back in Manila in 1592 James is the one to end up paying for his great great great great great grandpappy's actions!P.S The movie Daughters of Satan was released back in the fall of 1972 as a double feature with the also made in the Philippines bad movie horror classic Superbeast.";

But since i wanted to write a fair review i decided to continue watching the film at normal speed.There is a few scenes where normal people wouldn't react the way they do in this film.One example is when Selleck is threaten by a gunman.Afterwardshe enters the house and doesn't talk about it at all when he rejoins his wife.And why does Selleck want to hang the picture on the wall when her wife's first reaction is to tell him that she hates it?There is many sights of crosseswith Jesus on it in this film. Perhaps it's the only type of cross that you can get in the philippines!There is one on the wall over the bed and Barra wears one in her neck for most of the film.Apparently that has the power to keep bad witch spirits away but it doesn't seem to always work!In one of the better scenesan outside one Barra wants to stab Selleck in the back but changes her mind when her husband hands her a cross she supposedly lost.Other good scenes are the ones that features Selleck talking of the cursed painting with a Doctor but the appearing and disappearing figures on the painting plot kinds of gets annoying after a while.The evil housekeeper is also annoying and you'd wished that Selleck would have waked up and fired her earlier. He does but not with the energy that Peck did in THE OMEN and at this time it's way too late.There is like a false bad ending that turns into a good ending that returns to a bad ending in this film!!!I liked the first unhappy ending better than the last one!I agree that some unhappy endings may have a greater impact in certain horror films but i don't think that this one is properly staged to make a satisfying or powerful impact.Now some might like to know about the nutty parts of this film so here they are.1Bad words.Very few.About three. 2Very little gore.There is a man with a knife in him which is a little bit bloody. The crime has already been committed. 3Nudity.At first there is a topless woman on a table.She has her eyes closed. Not very interesting. The second scene is when kitty tries to seduce Selleck and goes half topless. Her other breast is covered by her hair. She's just a little bit better looking than Barra face wise. But then againnot everyone will agree since beauty is in the eye of the beholder!This scene works because the prelude is well written as she tries very hard to seduce Selleck which isn't much interested in her.The third scene is when Barra is stripped topless and the camera returns to her breasts a few times. Barra might not have the greatest face but breasts are breasts and if you like tied womenthis scene works!4Blasphemy.Barra spitting on the cross plus a few praise the devil type of phrases.Some of words spoken by Barra aren't easily understandable. Really not my cup of tea if you know what i mean!!So i guess this film could be listed as exploitation.it's about annoying illogical and dull here and there for 30 minutes but if this is your kind of filmyou might just find something you like about it.".

	schema:headline " Hilariously bad";
	schema:reviewBody "This film was so awful it provoked laughter rather than shudders. Tom Selleck is the major reason to see the film done at the beginning of his career. Fortunately it did not end his career. Along with everything else in the film he also is awful and that is probably because the script was so bad and the direction was probably nonexistent.The first 1520 minutes were terribly slow and I was tempted to stop watching. But then it suddenly became totally absurd. And enjoyable. Such as an unmotivated chase on foot through Manila. And Selleck and his wife visit a picturesque picnic spot and she finds a ceremonial dagger in the picnic basket and while Selleck has his back to her and is talking about how scenic the place is she makes to stab him only to quickly hide the knife each time he turns to look at her. Hilarious.There is a scene in which Tom's pink shirt matches the pink shade on a desk lamp. And there was a red and white typewriter on the desk it's a sad comment when you spend time admiring the details of the set decoration. There is a scene where a woman Selleck meets at their shrink's funeral invites him over for a postfuneral drink without his wife and she invites him into her bedroom to check a painting and again he is talking about the painting with his back turned to his hostess and when he turns to her she has removed all her clothes. He continues the conversation as though nothing had happened.The witches all belong to the Manila Assembly of Lucifer. That is actually in the dialogue. And probably they're also listed in the Manila Yellow Pages under ChurchesSatanic. Many of the actresses seem like they were found in porn films substandard acting but exceptional breasts. And there's an invisible dog a mortician who photographs naked female corpses and so many other completely insane touches.Personally I really enjoyed the film. But I can't give it more than three stars because objectively it is rather bad. And if Tom Selleck had not been in it but another actor giving exactly the same performance I'd probably give it a 2.".

One of the witches bears a striking resemblance to his wife. Soon she and two other women begin behaving in a very strange fashion. Selleck is sure that his wife and the other women are the spirits of the witches from the painting reincarnated. He must find a way to save not only his wife but himself as well.While most of the movie isn't very good some scenes work. There are even a few creepy moments. My personal favorite is when Selleck's wife is awoken in bed by a voice whispering her name. Another good scene is when the wife as a witch is stripped and whipped. Very well done. But there are moments in the movie where nothing happens. It's almost as if the writers had no idea of what to do next so we get to see exciting scenes like the wife staring at a window for 30 or so seconds.Most of the acting is forgettable. Selleck is okay just a little green around the edges. Most of the rest of the cast is really bad. The housekeeper is especially bad. Most of her delivery is just so unnatural.The most annoying thing about the movie is the soundtrack. It has some of the most inappropriate music you'll likely encounter.

	schema:reviewBody "Having enjoyed Rialto Film's later color filled Edgar Wallace adaptations I recently decided to give the earlier black and white adaptations a try. So far my favorite from that period just ahead of The Dark Eyes of London is The Door with 7 Locks. I'm not sure the mystery holds completely together but it is a great pulp set up. Seven keys are being held by seven rather unscrupulous individuals all of whom worked for a deceased lord whose son is supposed to inherit everything on his twentyfirst birthday. The seven keys fit into seven locks which open a door in a castle but what is behind that door? Scotland Yard inspector Dick Martin comes into the case after the murder of two of the key holders. Martin romances Sybil a librarian distantly related to the deceased lord and banters with his superior Sir John and the comic relief. This comic relief is once again played by Eddi Arent no apostrophe in his name autocorrect. Here he is playing an inspector who in spite of having the last name of Holmes has less than stellar deduction skills. However the two most welcome returning actors are Pinkas Braun the dashing villain from Secret of the Red Orchid and Ady Berber the Tor Johnson lookalike who played Blind Jack in The Dead Eyes of London. Here Berber's character Giacco strikes such fear into an intended victim that just hearing his name causes the target to grab a Sten Submachine gun and start blasting. I do not know how close the film is to the source material but the film is a highly enjoyable mystery. Unfortunately Klaus Kinski is bumped off too early. Recommended!".

It transpires that the doctor was carrying one of the keys that tie into a fortune that a soon to be 21 year old Lord is going to be inheriting. It also seems that someone is trying to kill the keepers of the keys in order to get the fortune for themselves. Remake of an earlier film with both based upon an Edgar Wallace story. This is a good film but its also a clichd Edgar Wallace story with everything you'd expect going onseemingly random murdera hidden fortune feuding heirs lots of red herrings an old manor house stalwart police. If you've seen any of the German Wallace films this is going to play like a greatest hits film of sorts. Its not bad actually its quite good its just that there isn't anything to make it stand out from the rest of the films in the series so instead of being one of the best it falls down to being one of many. Unremarkable nature of the plot aside this is still a film thats worth seeing because it is very good.".

The lead actor is Heinz Drache this time and the supporting cast includes familiar names such as Aren't Uhlen Peters and Kinski. And storywise I have to give the makers a bit of a thumbsup here. It may be the same people who made this like usual but there are changes to the plot that you find in pretty much no other Wallace film. So it's good they got the courage to enter new territories here and try to deliver in other areas than usual but nonetheless the outcome is pretty uninteresting and I did not feel it was very smart or even inspired. The story was just not good enough in terms of the writing. My final verdict Watch something else instead.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is easily the best German movie I have seen in the last three years. It is a haunting and atmospheric drama with some sciencefiction elements an eerie touch of suspense and even psychological horror as well as some action scenes. This flick has also a strong philosophical character without being too educative. The gripping question of fate and morality may affect you way beyond this movie and I thought about this intense film many days after I have watched it first.Normally I hardly give elevated ratings but everything feels right about the movie. The acting of the movie is simply great. Let's point out that Mads Mikkelsen is playing the role of his life and proves once again that he is a great actor that is able to improve every time again and again. He is amongst my favourite actors now. There are many promising German actors that are delivering more than solid jobs here.The scenario of this movie is based on a novel and filled with complex actions cliffhangers and twists just like a great book. I am really looking forward to read the novel now and though I can't yet compare both I feel that the movie was intense detailed and diversified. What I really find fascinating is that the movie even though the main plot is based on a fictional idea that one could associate to a sciencefiction or fantasy movie the whole flick seems real authentic and down to earth. The mixture is unique and credible. The movie is not about a magic door that leads to the past or present. This little and only fantastic detail helps to kick the whole story off and one is quickly face to face with situations that mix dreams and reality wishes and deceptions hopes and despairs so that one doesn't care about whether the introduction is not fitting or too unreal. This movie is not about something exactly supernatural it's a lot about the true human character and its ideologies and behaviours.The movie has what I consider a perfect structure it slowly introduces the main characters and creates more and more a creepy atmosphere with some weird surprising and shocking scenes that lead to a dramatic emotional and action filled ending. You really get drowned into the whole story and feel with the characters.The way the movie is filmed is full of details and the angels and close ups add a lot to the atmosphere of the film. The movie score underlines the incredible and creative story that starts as a drama and ends as a psychological thriller that is more intense than many horror flicks.I highly recommend this brilliant and explosive mixture that touches your heart your nerves and your brain. Spread the word about this rather unknown European flick that should gain worldwide attention as it has now come out in North America and the rest of the world.".

As an European movie I recommend it without hesitation and the thriller part was blended perfectly with the dark story.

The story line makes sense from beginning till end in this top smart suspense script with superb performance by Danish sexiest man of the year Mikkelsen and Schwartz as his wife. This story burns slow but fastidious and it twists and twists and twists. A perfect world is only one layer away from disaster is one that applies here and as said by Andr Maurois a man cannot free himself from the past more easily than he can from his own body.

	schema:reviewBody "let's start off by saying that Mads Mikkelsen has never been in a bad or unwatchable movie and he just continues to impress with every movie that he gets involved in. in case you've never heard of him he was the main baddie in  casino royale  he was one of arthurs swordsmen in  King Arthur  and i thought he really stood out among the other ensemble leads in that movie. last year he was the colead along with Shia Leboeuf in  the necessary death of Charlie Countryman . Uber talented actor and finally getting worldwide attention and in my opinion one of our planets finest male actors. just look at that face...it shows so many emotions and he can do everything and has done everything from comedy to action.this is one of the best movies i have watched in a long time and i had been saving this movie for a while cause i knew it was going to be a good movie and boy!...it sure didn't disappoint. the genre of this movie is very hard to describe i would say it is a scifi fantasy suspense thriller and finally drama.as soon as you turn on the movie you are hooked into the story. the story is about a famous married artistMikkelsen and his wife who works for a major pharmaceutical company and they have a lovely 7 year old daughter. while his wife is out working he works from his home and also watches over the daughter when she is home. he has a very bad problem or addiction where he is not a one woman guy. he often slips out while at home watching his daughter to go to a neighbors house and shag her. the neighbor threatens to tell his wife if he breaks up this arrangement. during one of these trysts his daughter slips in the huge backyard close to the pool with her shoelaces untied and she falls into the pool and her laces get caught in a filter at the bottom of the pool. Mikkelsen comes back from the neighbors house just not in time to save his little girl...cause he couldn't undo the laces that were caught in the filter. she dies and his already rocky marriage crumbles the wife knows that he has cheated on her many times.cut 5 years down the line and the artist is now a shell of a man and his wife has remarried his best friend and former student. he regrets what has happened terribly so much in fact where he has tried to commit suicide and is literally a functioning bum. one night he goes to his ex wifes place just so he can see her...but she doesn't want to see him cause it causes to much pain but she still cares about him. he leaves and goes back to their old house and in the yard he jumps in the pool and tries to kill himself. he looked particularly bad that night that worried his exwife so she tells her husbandformer student and still best friend to go and make sure hes OK. suffice to say that his friend gets there in time and jumps in and pulls him out. they separate and he wanders around till he gets to a spot where there is a lot of shrubs and bushes and he spots a hidden entrance.something makes him go in and it turns into a dark gloomy tunnel. he continues down the tunnel till hes almost at the end and he can actually see a ratty wooden door. he opens the door and by opening the door he gets a chance at redeeming his past life5 years ago and starting over. but wait...has he actually opened up a Pandoras box?????shows you that you can make movies at minimal budgets and still have it be a world class movie. all the leads were great you really got into the movie and the minimal score was awesome it set the tone so well in every situation in the movie. good movies like this need to be seen by more people but alas it rarely does everybodies into watching big budget blockbusters or silly overgored horror movies or dumb comedies.again...this was an awesome movie and i'm still thinking about it and it will not be a movie i will forget as a matter of fact every movie with Mads in it i remember even when he gets minor roles the guy still stands out. Mads you rock!".

	schema:headline " Many interesting moments";
	schema:reviewBody "Die Tr or The Door is a 100minute German movie from 6 years ago. The main character David is played by Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen already a distinguished Bond villain at this point. But let's talk about this film here. I quite liked the suspense from start to finish. We see a man who has an affair and has sex with his mistress while his little daughter drowns in a swimming pool. However lucky for him now a couple years later he runs into a portal with the help of which he can reappear moments before the tragic accident and save his daughter. Next this film takes on one question I have always been curious about in films about time travel. What happens when you find yourself from that era? And why so frequently isn't it happening. Well.. here it does and it has no good consequences for the old David. So for a large part of the film the new David lives the life of the old David until things get complicated in terms of a corpse and an aggressive neighbor and his special unit.This is a a bit of an identity theft movie even only that he stole his own identity. Mikkelsen plays his part well as usual but the supporting cast is fine too. Jessica Schwarz shines as the main character's wife. Heike Makatsch has a couple solid scenes as his mistress and Valerian Eisenbart plays her scenes nicely too. I am quite a fan and think she is among the most talented actresses from her very young age group. She played in recent years in the Fnf Freunde films and I'm sure we will see a lot more from her in years to come. And finally lets talk a bit about Thomas Thieme. I really love him as an actor and it's bizarre how he is so unknown even here in Germany looking at all the famous films he appeared in. Unfortunately I must say that I was not too impressed by him here. But that had nothing to do with his acting really but more with the last half hour that I did not like that much really in terms of the writing. I thought this worked best when it was purely about identity theft and the main character's interactions with his family etc. and there was no need to make this so violent with people killing and trying to kill doppelgangers all the time.All in all this is a fairly great film for the first hour or so and okay for everything afterward. I recommend this to everybody who loves German films love suspenseful thrillers likes the actors especially Mikkelsen in here in other roles or is just interested in the depiction of time travel in movies. Pay attention to the blue butterfly. Anno Saul Jan Berger and Akif Pirinci the people behind the creation of this film have all worked on other movies I liked so no surprise I liked this one here as well. Thumbs up this was a good watch.".

Basically its a spoof of The Hunt for Red October intermixed with minor spoofs on other action films.  A couple of interesting cameos are from Roddy McDowall as Mr. Friendly a Mr. Rogers sort of character and Michael Winslow forever remembered as the sound guy from the Police Academy movies.This movie was entertaining for me but I fear that a few of the jokes might not translate as well for those from outside of America.  However if you're a fan of Bill Pullman and the Mel Brooks' type of satire though he was uninvolved in this production you really need to check this film out!".

He has been in therapy ever since he went nuts and ran his sub onto a California beach. But there are those who have plans for him. A nefarious Presidential adviser Robert Vaughn wants to start a war with Russia and the Navy Admiral Malice Ned Beatty is his goto guy. The Secretary of Defense Roddy McDowall is a clueless tool who can be hoodwinked. A Sub Standard Sub is created which will be destroyed just as it makes an attempt to attack a Russian sub. Naturally these two want Biff to be the captain since they believe he is dispensable. Therefore they take him out of a therapy session and march him onto the Sub Standard. Joining him there is a pretty lieutenant Jan Wendy Schaal who hates Biff's guts a kid sub expert various inept crewmen and the Mole Ernie Sabella who is there to make sure everything goes wrong. Oh was it mentioned that this is also a stealth sub which can transform itself into the persona of a whale on command? Off it goes not knowing its true mission. Sure enough the Russians get wind that it is coming and are prepared to defend their territory with their own master sub the Pink Torpedo. Between Japanese fishermen who want to capture the sub when it switches to whale mode icebergs in the water and Biff who locks himself into the imaging room when the going gets rough what will be the finale of this expedition? This is a very silly rather lame spoof movie. It tries to be Airplane under water and it is not even close. Yet its not unwatchable and there are some inspired scenes. In addition the cast is terrific. Beatty is always a pleasure while Vaughn Pullman Schaal McDowall Sabella Joe Namath and Michael Winslow go for broke and keep the flick churning along. All the other actors whose names are not familiar are fun as well. The sets and costumes are nice while the mixedbag script and fairly weak direction are deterrents. In short if you like spoofs and don't care if they are inanely silly this movie will probably entertain you some Saturday night in the future.".

	schema:reviewBody "This story of lesbian love in a culture that forbids it is sensual and erotic without being uncomfortably graphic. It's also slowmoving so if you're watching just for the physical stuff be prepared to wait a long while and then be disappointed. The cinematography is beautiful and the gradual buildup makes the romantic feelings seem more real. If you're bothered by a little malebashing avoid this film because to say that both the male characters are unpleasant jerks is putting it mildly. However interactions with the men serve to expand the story a bit beyond just the relationship between the women. I recommend this film if you can be patient with the pace.".

The director made a beautiful film about this situation and said I wanted to tell the story of what it is like to lose the right to love as can happen in any time and any place.

	schema:reviewBody "I stumbled upon this movie last week and just happened to finish it yesterday. Have to say out of those loud CGI filled films and those typical LGBT movies i've watched recently The Chinese Botanist's daughter is a pleasant treat.The story starts with Min Lia half Chinese half Russian orphan who lives in the post war period of China. She's going to intern for one of the best Chinese botanist there is. And once she arrives she notices that her internship is not going to be easy. The professor is a much perfectionist person with short temperwhich would be shorten a lot more when it comes to untraditional behavior. But despite all that during her stay in the exotic garden Li finds herself attracted to Anthe botanist's daughter. Their bond grows stronger and their love blossoms alongside this beautiful landscape. However things turn ugly when Li has to marry the botanist's son in order to never leave the garden so she could live with An after her intern ends. And the conservative society has very little place for the both of them.The story seems solid enough nothing extremely special or stand out here but it's soft while intense exotic yet tender traditional yet manages to has very different feeling. Its visual is absolutely stunning and full of desire. I have seen so many oriental landscape embedded films but not many comes close to be this sexy and spiritual. Of course this was filmed in Vietnam and not China but it's hardly an argument here. The director definitely has eyes and heart. The acting flows well the characters come out quite naturally. The girls really are victims of their times so it's sadden seeing them trying their best for love and survival. However even though some scene can be more than cruel or brutal and makes your heart jump it's strangely uplifting in the kindest way. Once in a while this movie appears to be a little bit distracting with cutaway scene and long silent moment but we all have taste and style i guess.Of course what's risky about this movie is that it's very cultural oriented. It's not that if you're not Chinese you won't understand. Surely one will know that it was that way at that time in that country but still the culture aspect will make one with experience or understanding about China less depress than one who don't. Certain characters might appear twodimensional and the cruelty shall frustrate the viewers. But it is a quite small factor and if you're already interested don't let this stop you watching. This is a great film that actually has style. Even if you're not a fan of LGBT films The Chinese botanist's daughter has potential to be appealing to openminded movie lovers. If you're against homosexuality...well i can't see why you would wandering here and read my comment to this point. I know art can sometimes change the world and people's mind set but i'm not gonna try.".

	schema:headline " Exceptionally Poetic Portrayal of the Last Eden of Asia I love this movie";
	schema:reviewBody "It is an exquisite work. With an incredible cinematography and both casts are exceptionally well fit for the part they play. It is very hard not to learn to love Mylne Jampano who plays Li Min She is an exceptionally precious asset to Asian Love Stories of highly spiritual contents that requires subtle but sublime or even ethereal quality.Sad and lonely look in her eyes in contrast to such girlish and intimate gaits with energetic down to earth acting makes her endearing image to retain a very special place in every viewer's heart of both genders her muted whispers in search of love can be heard time after times like a poem. It's a hauntingly beautiful story too but very sad and heart breaking with a sudden shocking and apathetic ending for those understands that how much the relationship meant to Li Min The Conservative society was so unforgiving to them in such a way that the Chinese society could not offer a space for them to survive.It would surely cause a traumatic sorrow to everyone grew up in Japan to find out Li Min and Chen An were put to death. Only if they had lived in the community knowing the fact that they could have found their perfect paradise in Kyoto Japan and worked together as long as they wanted. It was considered perfectly normal for a couple of court ladies to share a bed room and bath whilst in service to the imperial court. Japan has a long history of parthenocratie blossomed amongst highly privileged members worked in the court in ancient imperial capital 'Kyoto' from the Hei An Era meaning Periode for peace and tranquility It still continues to be an elegant and definitely most popular and lenient city for female couples. Lush and ancient gardens of average age of 1000 years old. Luscious landscapes and unisexed sweet sounding dialect makes it a Heaven for young couple like Li Min and Chen An. Only the requiring for them to become wealthy and affluent was to be born or adapted into a noble family and work for a crowned princess as lady in waiting. There were in fact generous princesses who would accept a pair to be employed at the same time. There is a silk screen painting of a female couple of court ladies on the Great Gojo bridge holding hands in a summer evening watching fire works. Such a scene comes out quite naturally and blends well into this 1200 years old city built around ancient tradition catering to Imperial family lord chamberlains lord reagents and court ladies including those who preferred same sex companions.Relationships amongst Female were not penalised elsewhere in the world either OrientJapan or Europe Sweden in human history. They have been protected by sovereign monarch since such relationship were more readily blossomed in highly privileged or educated environment such as in and between princess and lady in waiting court poets court musicians and likes amongst those who are blessed with exceptional beauty like Li Min Venus and An Chen Diane. When a woman look for a soul of mother in another woman such bond can grow often stronger than relationship with a male. I as a bystander can almost visualise their ethereal love precipitate and purify then crystallise into a precious jewel.Mylne Jampano impresses every viewers with such a captivating screenplay so real and natural She is simply outstanding! Throughout my life I have never seen a such an exceptionally perfect mixture of both Eastern and Western worlds in any one person to this date. Needless to mention even in 1116 models whom I photographed for Pinup and Calendar market between 1980 and 1994 in San Francisco Bay Area. No one has even come a halfway near to such an incredible perfection in projecting beauties from the both side of worlds with such balance and harmony that I find in this actress. I was so stunned and could not help but repeatedly keep asking myself What Have I done with my life? have I been a blind or sleeping all these years? You have to be very patient and watch the entire length of movie to understand her indispensable assets that are uniquely of her own due to the fact that her incredible beauty comes out to afore from her soul. Look for an intimate smile filled with warmth and bliss in the scene by the temple where she releases 108 doves into the sky with Chen An. Once you discover her inner beauty it is very hard for anyone regardless of gender or age not to love her. Her image will stay behind your eyes for days.Sadly there is only one Mylne in this entire world of 6 billion people. I am a mixture of oriental and occidental myself but I look more oriental except for my mouth snd nose. In fact I am extremely envious of her parents for being blessed with a daughter with such extraordinary ability beauty talents and wisdom. It always has been one of my life long dream to have children with more perfect mixture from the both worlds I married an American lady of Germanic heritage. But all our children look more like occidental with a long and pointed nose along with turquoise blue eyes not harmoniously blend in with oriental crowds.".

They are too long and too often  OK we know they are in love . If you put that aside than this movie have some chance to win the competition at the world film festival of Montreal  That's where i saw it .

	schema:reviewBody "With Balzac and the little seamstress Dai Sijie delivered a nice period piece with some interesting reflections on the importance of literature moving images and theatre. Although a large part of the crew were French it had a real Chinese feel to it. That feeling is totally absent from Les filles du botaniste. One gets the impression it has been made to order to cater to the European market. There's hardly any Chinese name on the credit roll if they're not French they're Vietnamese. The story could have been powerful but has been diluted by its clich approach and its David Hamiltonesquire photography. In addition I got completely disoriented by the Vietnamese setting. The worst mismatch was the temple. It was so blatantly a Vietnamese not a Chinese temple. And using Ho Guom Lake right in the middle of Old Hanoi was not a wise decision. There were plenty of other lakes to choose from while the urban setting of Ho Guom made it hard to forget we were not supposed to be in 2006. The mountain landscape in the movie is similar to the karst rocks in southern China so no problem with that. I even wonder if the Kunlin in the film is not meant to be a combination of Kunming and Guilin. Still I felt cheated by this movie. It is as if the makers are not taking the public serious. It was the same with Memoirs of a Geisha another Eastern tale made consumable to Western tastes with 3 very Chinese actresses trying to be Japanese and failing. But hey who cares? If it has slanted eyes it's all the same no? One of the commentators to Memoirs of a Geisha was calling it neocolonialism. I think the same could be said of these Filles.".

There were plenty of other lakes to choose from while the urban setting of Ho Guom made it hard to forget we were not supposed to be in 2006. The mountain landscape in the movie is similar to the karst rocks in southern China so no problem with that. I even wonder if the Kunlin in the film is not meant to be a combination of Kunming and Guilin. Still I felt cheated by this movie. It is as if the makers are not taking the public serious. It was the same with Memoirs of a Geisha another Eastern tale made consumable to Western tastes with 3 very Chinese actresses trying to be Japanese and failing. But hey who cares? If it has slanted eyes it's all the same no? One of the commentators to Memoirs of a Geisha was calling it neocolonialism. I think the same could be said of these Filles.";

At presentpeople's attitudes towards gays are much more tolerant in China.Amazinglymore and more people really think that they are gay. I think the movie is used as a tool to make more and more people to accept lesbian love.From this aspectI appreciate what the director has done.Anyhowthe movie is fairly unrealistic.

	schema:reviewBody "I was looking forward to this film but it was a big letdown. The best parts of the film and why I give it as much as a 4 are 1 The efforts of the two main actresses. They really tried but those efforts were wasted on the uninspired dialogue directing and editing. 2 The physical beauty of the settings sets and some of the lighting and atmosphere. Even here we have to subtract the fact that the movie was obviously not filmed in China and did not do a good job of pretending to be in China. The success there was in this area was wasted on the problems itemized below.The bad parts of the film were 1 Almost no character development. Every character is uninteresting. The two men are nothing but self centred brutes with no other characteristics. There was not much more depth to the women. It was hard to develop a full sympathy for them. And that is too bad. The opportunity was there and the actresses were there to do it. 2 Uneven story progression. It frequently goes from scene to scene in a disjointed fashion. How much useful content was cut? This seems to want to be an artistic lush film. So why not stretch it out to 120 minutes or more and do justice to the characters and the story? This might simply be the director's fault but the editors and producers might have played a part in that. 3 Thin story. Not much happens. Some films can get away with that but here we don't even get nicely drenched in what does happen. 4 Uninspired directing. We get neither a fully indulgent artistic film nor something brash and inyourface nor any kind of satisfying balance thereof. To be fair the director might have actually created the material for a better film which was then badly edited. Alternatively maybe the diversity of the production crew prevented the film from having a clear identity. 5 Old hat tired symbolism. I don't want to put in specific spoilers but suffice it to say that it was very obvious and hyper familiar. 6 Lost potential. It's just a shame when some good components and potential are lost.".

That said here's my review.A young woman Min Li leaves her orphanage to intern with a renown botanist for 30 days. The botanist's daughter Cheng An and Min Li become friends quickly but you soon see something more intimate developing. Enter the botanist's son on leave from the army. Mr. Chen the botanist and dad wants his son Dan to marry and have children and so encourages Dan to pursue Min Li. Dan readily agrees but Min Li rebuffs his advances. Min Li will leave at the end of 30 days and Cheng An won't abandon her father to go away with Min Li. Cheng An figures out a way she and Min Li can remain together have Min Li marry her brother Dan. Dan is stationed in a nearby city and likely will remain stationed there indefinitely. Apparently women are not permitted on the base so Min Li as Dan's wife would reside at Mr. Chen's home along with Cheng An where she and Cheng An will love each other happily ever after. Things don't work out as planned after Mr Chen finds the women together.The love affair was shown in a gentle yet effective manner. I remember only one scene with exposed breasts. Mr Chen was selfabsorbed and unaware of the women fooling around until the honeymoon began. Dan came off as a brute for abusing his new wife on their honeymoon. He was upset to find his wife wasn't a virgin  which maybe is justified in that culture I don't know. In the end the women were reunited in a way I didn't expect. I liked the music soundtrack. It had a symphonic feel to it and at times featured the violins. There were some nice scenic shots throughout the movie. For me the movie seemed to last longer than it actually did. My recommendation watch this movie ONLY if someone pays you.".

Here he gets in contact with Lu Sybille Schmitz and her upperclass family and their political friends where he makes such favorable impression that they even plan to nominate him as Reichstag parliament candidate for their fictional Freisinnige Wirtschaftspartei. The main political issue seems to be a law to prescribe gussets Zwickel in swimwear which at least in part reflects a real event the Zwickelerlass of 1932. Some snide remarks on the Soviet Union and life of the workers there are also included. Famous satiricist Werner Finckh is seen as the man from the press. The tension comes mostly from Karl's double role as waiter vs. upperclass gentleman.Substantial parts of this movie deal with horseracing betting and cheating in those. Karl wins a lot of money loses it again finds a lot to lose it again and after some mild thriller action in BadenBaden ruefully returns home to the unnamed Baltic place to marry his Grete.The unspoken message is Aren't we happy that the preHitler days of 1930 are over? But 50 years later this is still an interesting document of the times. Just keep in mind it was endorsed by the propaganda ministry.".

	schema:headline " As good as a Mann directed Western?";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the Western that director Anthony Mann backed away from claiming that the script was too weak. Was he justified in doing so? How does Night Passage measure up when compared with the Mann Westerns? Is it as good?Let's look at the positives first. The scenery filmed in the Colorado Rockies is magnificent on a par with the best of Mann's Westerns. As for action there is plenty of it climaxed with a great shootout. The cast is experienced many of them veterans from previous Mann efforts. No big difference here. Audie Murphy stands tall as the Utica Kid. He is introduced to the screen dramatically framed against the sky dressed all in black as he pulls up his horse to look down upon the train that will soon be relieved of its precious cargo. Back at the outlaw hideaway he sits back in quiet amusement as he goads mercurial boss Whitey Harbin Dan Duryea knowing how far he can push and when to back away. Definitely the most interesting character.However Night Passage falls down in two very important areas the treatment of the leading man and the strength of the overall script. Mann's heroes are emotionally scarred bordering on hysteria and total breakdown before finally getting the upper hand. James Stewart's Grant McLaine never comes close to reaching that point even though he has plenty of things to fret about his brother is an outlaw he lost his job with the railroad after helping his brother escape and he can't find another job. He contents himself playing the accordion and singing for small change and we can never really get the feel of his deep resentment. Mann's Westerns are lean and taut with no superfluous dialog and no wasted scenes. Director James Nielson on the other hand gets sidetracked allowing himself to engage in the kind of tomfoolery that director John Ford was sometimes wont to do. At the railroad camp workers who we never see working dance to McLaine's accordion playing until that degrades into a wild freeforall. Ford could pull off this kind of thing Nielson is less successful. To sum up and answer the question this Western doesn't quite measure up to those of Mann's but it's not bad either. It can be enjoyed as entertainment as long as one doesn't look for great character depth. Whether Anthony Mann could have made it something more will forever be a matter of conjecture.".

	schema:reviewBody "Without Anthony Mann to deliver the goods one would expect Night Passage to be a flop under the direction of the TVoriented James Neilson. Quite the contrary is the case. This is one of the best westerns of the 50's. Audie Murphy continually underrated by the Hollywood big wigs turns in his best performance ever even better than in the more touted The Red Badge of Courage or in To Hell and Back in which he plays himself. One senses that he is actually portraying himself more in Night Passage than in his autobiographical film. He is up against stiff competition and more than takes care of himself. James Stewart is fine as always and his accordion playing is above average. Hell even his singing isn't all that bad. Some entertainers with less musical talent have built careers for themselves in the record industry. Dan Duryea gives an over the top rendition of gang leader Whitey Harbin which isn't bad just different for the gifted actor. The only one wasted in the picture is the fabulous Jack Elam given only a minor character role with no place to go with it. The rest of the cast including Hugh Beaumont aka Ward Cleaver strut their stuff including the two women Dianne Foster and Elaine Stewart. Brandon De Wilde is still playing his Joey Starrett part from Shane. The viewer can almost hear him yelling Shane! Come back Shane!The script by Borden Chase from a story by Norman Fox is a fairly predictable one reminiscent in some ways of the more complex one Chase wrote for the StewartMann masterpiece Winchester '73. Grant McLaine Stewart wants his old railroad job back. He's provided the opportunity by doing a job for the railroad personally carrying the payroll to the workers at the end of the track to prevent Whitey and his gang from stealing it as they were in the habit of doing on a regular basis. There is a conflict of interest though since a gun riding with the Whitey gang is The Utica Kid Murphy with whom McLaine has a private connection. Unable to find the payroll Whitey and his gang kidnap the wife of railroad tycoon Ben Kimball Jay C. Flippen holding her until the payroll is turned over to them. The title Night Passage concerns not only the action that takes place in the night between McLaine and the gang but also the personal transactions that occur among the assorted characters involved in the resolution of the story.Another asset for Night Passage is the cinematography zeroing in on the beautiful Colorado landscape around Durango. The Narrow Gauge Railroad train ride from Durango to Silverton is available for tourists to see the topography first hand. The El Rio de las Animas Perdidas The River of Lost Souls called the Animas River by most is indeed a site to behold.".

	schema:headline " Funny Man.";
	schema:reviewBody "As many Western fans know Night Passage was all set up to be the sixth genre collaboration between director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart. After a run of successful and genre defining adult Westerns the prospect of another was mouth watering to the genre faithful. The promise of something good was further boosted by the names of others involved in the project. The screenplay is written by Borden Chase Red RiverWinchester '73 cinematographer was William H. Daniels The Far Country the score is from Dimitri Tiomkin High NoonGiant and joining Stewart in the cast are Audie Murphy Dan Duryea Jay C. Flippen Jack Elam  the wee lad from Shane Brandon De Wilde. That's some serious Western credentials. But sadly Mann was to bail at the last minute the reasons given vary depending on what source you believe.It's thought that Mann was unimpressed with Chase's screenplay feeling it lacked a cutting edge as reportedly so did Stewart. The casting of Murphy was also said to be a bone of contention to the talented director while it has simply been put down to him having other commitments he had both The Tin Star  Men in War out in 1957. Either way Mann was out and the film was never going to be better for that situation sadly Mann  Stewart fell out over it and never worked together again.

	onyx:emotionText "As many Western fans know Night Passage was all set up to be the sixth genre collaboration between director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart. After a run of successful and genre defining adult Westerns the prospect of another was mouth watering to the genre faithful. The promise of something good was further boosted by the names of others involved in the project. The screenplay is written by Borden Chase Red RiverWinchester '73 cinematographer was William H. Daniels The Far Country the score is from Dimitri Tiomkin High NoonGiant and joining Stewart in the cast are Audie Murphy Dan Duryea Jay C. Flippen Jack Elam  the wee lad from Shane Brandon De Wilde. That's some serious Western credentials. But sadly Mann was to bail at the last minute the reasons given vary depending on what source you believe.It's thought that Mann was unimpressed with Chase's screenplay feeling it lacked a cutting edge as reportedly so did Stewart. The casting of Murphy was also said to be a bone of contention to the talented director while it has simply been put down to him having other commitments he had both The Tin Star  Men in War out in 1957. Either way Mann was out and the film was never going to be better for that situation sadly Mann  Stewart fell out over it and never worked together again. In came TV director James Neilson and the film was wrapped and released with mixed commercial results. Yet the film still remains today rather divisive amongst the Western faithful due in the main one feels to that Mann spectre of potentially a better film hanging over it.Night Passage is a good enough genre offering but the plot is slight and the story lacks the dark intensity that Mann one thinks would have given it.

	schema:reviewBody "As good a Western as it is Night Passage was filmed under quite unfortunate circumstances. The primary disaster involved the breakup of James Stewart my favorite actor and director Anthony Mann who suddenly walked off the picture very early in production. Apparently the cast and crew knew about Stewart's and Mann's parting of ways and simply wished to get the picture over with. And according to Jack Elam who played one of the bad guys named Shotgun the miserable weather in Durango Colorado caused delays in the filming and subsequently some pretty hot tempers.Nevertheless Night Passage is a good Western about an itinerant musician named Grant McLaine Stewart who is hired by railroad tycoon Ben Kimball Jay C. Flippen to defend the payroll train against Whitey Harbin Dan Duryea and his gang. It so happens that one of the outlaws is McLaine's brother known as the Utica Kid Audie Murphy. Stewart and Murphy do a very fine job together in this Western and the casting of Duryea as the head villain is so great it is quite laughable. One particular author pointed out that Duryea gives one of his whiniest performances in Night Passage and he is correct.The best thing about this film is that it offers Stewart the opportunity to play the accordion which he did in real life and sing. The three tunes that he performs in this movie are Sweet Betsy from Pike Follow the River and You Can't Get Far Without a Railroad. His singing is fine but his accordion playing is obviously faked and for myself this is a major disappointment. Watch how brilliantly Stewart handles a rifle in Winchester '73 1950 or how accurately he handles the slide positions on a trombone in The Glenn Miller Story 1954. These two examples reveal the authenticity of Stewart's handling of various objects on film as if he had used them all his life. Hence I am at a complete loss to understand why Stewart could not be equally as authentic with the accordion an instrument he had played since he was a boy. Fortunately I do not allow this disappointment to prevent me from enjoying the three songs.Night Passage did not receive the greatest reviews and it is certainly not James Stewart's most popular Western. But it is still a good one with beautiful scenery shoot'emup action a lively dance sequence and pleasant music.".

	schema:reviewBody "The workers on the railroad are threatening to stop work and slow down the progress across the country because they haven't been getting paid. Every time the payroll is brought in it is stolen by Whitey Harbin and his gang. Thinking that nobody would suspect him the bosses ask exemployee Grant McLaine to carry the money on the next train. However when the train gets robbed anyway Grant loses the money and is forced to set out after Whitey to rescue a boy the boss' wife and the money  bringing him into a fight with the infamous Utica Kid.I was drawn to this film by the names in the cast list which was a good thing because it were these names that made the film better than they were by virtue of their performances. The actual plot is quite plodding in the first half but gets better in the second half. Even with this stronger half though it is still not a great western that could possibly compare to Stewart's better films. The musical numbers dances and gentle set up of the first half almost had be losing interest and it is only the twists and gun fights of the final 30 minutes that make it memorable and worth seeing. Even then it is not without other flaws  characters are a problem. If you are able to understand the Utica Kid as a person then you are doing better than I did  in fact the film even lost it's first choice director because he was unable to understand the character's personality or motivation. The rest of the characters are pretty much as you'd expect  loyal girls evil villains cute kids etc although they are made better by the delivery.Stewart is always watchable and he carries the film well here. He is not a great singer but he does OK with the songs given him but his greater input is in delivering a tough character who is not all pure goodness but has a bit of a past to him. Murphy is cool and slick but he isn't a great actor and he isn't able to make the slightly irrational Utica Kid work as a person. Duryea overacts to good effect but gets forgotten by the film near the end while support is OK from Stewart Foster De Wilde and Jack Elam.Overall this is nothing special but it is still quite enjoyable. The number of well known names in the cast prevent me from calling it a Bmovie but essentially that's what it could have been if not for the stars. The plot is deadly slow for the first half but has a good fastpaced final 30 minutes that make up for it. The actors in particular James Stewart lift the film and make it feel better and it is fun if pretty unmemorable.".

Compared the the average Western of the time they had rather complex and featured nontraditional plots. As a rule I actually hate the formulaic Western as they have absolutely nothing new to offer and are just too derivative to be taken seriously. While this movie does have some new plot devices and the excellent acting of Stewart this movie is the closest of these Westerns to approach the old formulaic themes. As a result it is probably my least favorite of his films but it is still pretty watchable.Stewart uncharacteristically is a traveling accordion player I am NOT kidding about this really and he has been doing this job for several years since being blamed for a train robbery he was working for the railroad at the time. This film gives him a chance to prove himself and regain his old job with the railroad. But along the way he encounters Brandon DeWilde the cute kid from Shane who was killed at a very young age and Audie Murphy the war hero and actor who also died way too young. Aside from these two characters and Stewart nothing about the plot is particularly outstanding. A decent and watchable film but awfully predictable and forgettable.By the waya note to movie buffsyou DO get to hear Jimmy Stewart sing several songs in this film! While his singing was absolutely awful in BORN TO DANCE in this film it isn't badthe loud and cacophonous according did great things to hide his less than stellar voice! If only he'd used it in this previous musical!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Night Passage is one of a series of westerns made by the venerable James Stewart for Universal in the 50's and 60's. This one is directed by James Neilson rather than Anthony Mann but is nonetheless an above average western. Grant McLaine Stewart has been wondering from place to place over the past five years earning his living by singing songs and playing the accordion. McLaine had been fired by the railroad for appearing to have helped his outlaw brother The Utica Kid Audie Murphy escape justice five years earlier. The railroad is being robbed of their payrolls by Whitey Harbin Dan Duryea and his gang. Railroad boss Kimball Jay C. Flippen rehires McLaine to guard the next payroll.

	onyx:emotionText "Night Passage is one of a series of westerns made by the venerable James Stewart for Universal in the 50's and 60's. This one is directed by James Neilson rather than Anthony Mann but is nonetheless an above average western. Grant McLaine Stewart has been wondering from place to place over the past five years earning his living by singing songs and playing the accordion. McLaine had been fired by the railroad for appearing to have helped his outlaw brother The Utica Kid Audie Murphy escape justice five years earlier. The railroad is being robbed of their payrolls by Whitey Harbin Dan Duryea and his gang. Railroad boss Kimball Jay C. Flippen rehires McLaine to guard the next payroll. Along the way McLaine learns that the Utica Kid is a part of Whitey's gang.  McLaine befriends a boy Joey Brandon DeWilde as he is being chased by surly villain Concho Robert Wilke.

The answer is in fact not too badlythough Neilson clearly lacks Mann's cinematic style and depthand directs in an efficient if straightforward manner.NIGHT PASSAGE's main asset is it's striking colour photography by William Danielswith some Colorado locations shown to spectacular effect.Along with the everreliable Stewartthere are many familiar western character actors involved such as Paul FixJay C.FlippenRobert J.WilkeJack Elam and Chuck Robersonthough Mann's concerns over the script are justified in some aspects as the story about a stolen payroll from a train dialogue and characterisations are mostly mundane and unremarkablethough the abovementioned cast and scenery at least manage to keep interest to a decent level.Juvenile Brandon De Wilde's role here is nowhere as notable as it was in the classic SHANE four years earlierand Dan Duryea overplays his hand as the main villain involved.Audie Murphy appears as Stewart's younger brother and Duryea's partner in crimeand actually acquits himself rather well.An underrated actor not least by absent director Mann himselfMurphy's underplaying carries far more menace than Duryea's amplified histrionicsthough in the end he turns good again and works alongside his elder brother Stewart in a fairly wellstaged gunfight finale. Jimmy Stewart also has an opportunity to show his reallife prowess on the accordion throughout the film although it was allegedly dubbed over by someone else afterwards and vocalise as wellwhich he does adequately if nothing else.The title itself seems rather ambivalent and unclearand aspects of the plot predate a similar storyline about sibling relations and interconflicts in a western Stewart made 11 years later with Dean Martin BANDOLERO!.NIGHT PASSAGE has certain points of meritbut is not as memorable or notable as you would usually expect from a James Stewart western.One can only speculate how more conspicuous the final result could have been had Anthony Mann ironed out his concerns and differences with the scriptMurphyand Stewart himselfthe world of cinema was a poorer place after their parting of the waves.RATING6 and a half out of 10.".

	schema:headline " An unfortunate stumbling effort in the Western genre";
	schema:reviewBody "There are a few of very necessary things to remember when creating a Western especially back when Westerns were a thriving genre. There are A LOT of them and some of them are spectacular and fans of Westerns are a very particular sort and if you don't give us what we want...we'll hate it. Night Passage in general has a potentially decent story but it gets bogged down in poor production decision bad casting and if the rumours are true there was a lot of tense clashing on the set and that hurts a film and often comes through in the final product. Night Passage feels like missed potential. It feels like they rushed certain parts and they weren't sure whether they were going for a thriller a heist movie or...oh yah a Western. It just quite often felt like it was often missing its heart and soul somewhere in there and I think it boils down to not feeling the chemistry and energy from the cast. Still the landscape scenery and scenes aboard the tops of trains are truly outstanding. There is just some jaw dropping moments of scenery that they would have to create without the aid of computers like they do now.Since I became a MASSIVE James Stewart fan in the last year or so I am piling through his Westerns. I will say that Night Passage is the first Western of his I've seen where he isn't the angry volatile rough cowboy as he is in some of the other ones. He has a much softer side but not too soft in his performance. He does well but rumour has it that he took this role so that he could play his accordion and sing both of which he does quite well BUT it feels forced into the story and seems silly in context. I had heard of Audie Murphy before but I'm fairly certain this is the first time I've seen him in action. Another rumour is that original director Anthony Mann left the project because he felt among other things that Murphy was wrong for the role...well Mann should rest easy because he was right. Murphy is too soft too short looks ridiculous and completely unbelievable as this legendary evil criminal. I don't know if he is like this in every role but this was not a good one for him and the chemistry between he and Stewart is nonexistent. Dan Duryea was actually the far superior villain and instead he is reduced to a sidekick for Murphy and that's ludicrous. However Duryea still makes a good villain and saves that aspect of the film. Everyone else is decent in their perspective roles. Brandon DeWilde does a decent job as the kid that latches onto Stewart's cowboy. He's a little irritating and overused but he's alright. The women in the film are so underused and out of place and too much emphasis is put onto the bizarre love triangles and former flames going on.On the surface a Western is sort of like a horror film...reeeeally easy to make and please fans. There are a few key ingredients that have to be in place to make a good Western and Night Passage seems to have some brawls bad guys good guys train robberies and dusty towns but none of it comes together just right. It was okay but when you're swimming in a sea of westerns you have to be better than just okay. Director James Neilson is someone who comes from mostly television and perhaps he didn't have the chops or experience to make this work quite right. Night Passage as far as I know isn't considered a classic and you will find out why though I am sure it has its solid fans. I look forward to moving on and getting back to high quality Westerns. This one is forgettable at best. 5.510".

	schema:headline " NOT your typical Western  but very good";
	schema:reviewBody "Typical Western is one of those frequent timeworn labels I think some people use who don't find this particular genre of much interest or entertaining. It's like the typical war movie the 'typical musical the typical romantic comedy the typical mystery. I apologize to people who write such things because I don't read them. If someone can't describe the qualities  good or bad  of a film but instead choose to use such catchall phrases as typical well  I typically don't think there's much reason to read their comments further. A couple of reviewers gave that label to Night Passage and I tried to think what was so typical about it. How was it like Stagecoach? El Dorado? Once Upon a Time in the West? High Noon? Along Came Jones? MacKenna's Gold? Angel and the Badman? The Searchers? Hombre? Rooster Cogburn? The Big Trail? Major Dundee? OneEyed Jacks? Broken Arrow? Gunfight at the O.K. Corral? Man of the West? The Man Who Killed Liberty Valance? Open Range? The Cowboys? Fort Apache? The Horse Soldiers? The Magnificent Seven? This is just a sampling of some of the better typical Westerns that are all quite different in plot setting action and scenery. So how is Night Passage typical? Well it has guns and horses and cowboy hats and boots and a fist fight and women. And it has an accordion and some singing. Now that's real typical for a Western. And there's a train. Yes indeed probably half a dozen to a dozen Westerns have been made that have trains in them  out of 200 or more notable films of the genre. And Western scenery? Absolutely  only this is set in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado with trees and mountains and streams but not lots of sagebrush or buttes of Monument Valley. It does fall short on some typical things such as the one or two standard Western towns. Mostly this is shot in a train camp a mining area and in the great outdoors.Enough of my tongueincheek fun with the typicalness of Night Passage. This is one very good film with a very interesting plot. But mostly it has a top notch cast  a big one  of excellent actors who all give very good performances. And the scenery is spectacular. Just a typically very good Western all around. And just different enough to not bore one to death watching it.".

Though actually he is equally good in John Huston's The Unforgiven. Those two are his centerpiece renditions. The movie itself is really pretty stupid yet rises far far above said same by the main performers. Anytime Murphy is on the screen it comes electrically alive. Here we see the baby faced killer at his most terrifying. Look up his Colmar Forest action in world war two and you will see that he was the real deal and his twisted smiles are positively psycho in this one and even crazier is that he is playing it all one stop below Dan Duryeas supposedly even wilder psychosis. When they are on the screen together it's almost Laurel and Hardy with guns very very funny stuff in a totally fraught way. Here comes a spoiler. So if you are going to see the movie first I would suggest you skip this paragraph. It revolves around a very curious feature of Stewart. Nobody ever did one thing in the entire history of cinema and got away with it more naturally than Sir James. And he does it again here. Crying. Repeatedly he has broken into tears so believably so touchingly that nobody ever noticed. Yet time and again he does it in Naked Spur Its a Wonderful Life Vertigo Night Passage. In Night Passage right at the end just watch him break down so heart breakingly with the line.....no I'll ....I'll take care of my brother. Very very moving. Also I have mentioned elsewhere that nobody ever received physical punishment so horrifyingly as Stewart. Far Country Bend of the River Man From Laramie Winchester 73 all Mann westerns he does it so well you wince this is what is must actually look like when people are shot or burned or beaten. Just amazing what the guy could do and do it more believably than Brando great as Brando was. Yet all that said Murphy for once gives the more interesting performance because this is the perfect vehicle for his killer mentality. After all the guy did sleep with a service 45. under his pillow until the day he died. Night Passage was his best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Night Passage should have been the sixth Western collaboration between James Stewart and director Anthony Mann. Mann however withdrew from the project because he found the script weak and because he disagreed with the casting of Audie Murphy as Stewart's costar.Stewart plays Grant McLaine a former troubleshooter for railroad company. Grant lost his job when he was suspected of dishonest collusion with a bandit known as the Utica Kid and unable to find alternative employment has earned a living playing the accordion. Stewart himself was a talented performer on this instrument. Grant's former boss Ben Kimball however is in trouble. His payroll has been robbed several times by the Utica Kid and his gang and his workers are threatening to leave the job if they don't get paid soon. Grant therefore accepts the job of taking 10000 to them by train.I think that Mann's reservations about this film were justified even though it led to the rupture of his relationship with Stewart. Following their disagreement they never worked together again and according to some versions of the story never spoke to one another again. There was certainly a suspicion in some quarters that Audie Murphy's career as a film star owed more to his distinguished war record than it did to any acting talent. This viewpoint was not always to be proved correct Murphy was for example excellent in The Red Badge of Courage a film in which he was able to draw upon his own wartime experiences. Night Passage however is not one of his better performances.As regards the script Mann was quite correct to describe it as weak. The earlier StewartMann Westerns The Naked Spur is a good example were noted for their dark tone similar to the pessimistic cynical tone of contemporary film noir with Stewart normally playing a flawed ambiguous character rather than the sort of cleancut heroes he had played in his earlier career. They can in fact be seen as prefiguring the revisionist Westerns of the sixties and early seventies. Night Passage lacks the depth and sense of moral ambiguity which characterised Mann's Westerns. Like Howard Kemp Stewart's character in The Naked Spur Grant McLaine is hiding a secret namely that the Utica Kid is really his younger brother Lee which is why he allowed the Kid to escape on a previous occasion. Presumably the family couldn't decide which side they were on during the Civil War so named one son after a Northern general and the other after a Confederate one. The film does not however make the most of the dramatic possibilities of this plot line and there is little ambiguity about Grant essentially a misunderstood cleancut hero who hopes to redeem his brother by turning him away from a life of crime.After Mann left the production the film was directed by James Neilson. Although Neilson was to direct a few more films in the sixties such as The MoonSpinners he worked mainly in television and Night Passage was in fact his first feature film. The pacing of the film is often slack and the storyline can be confusing it struck me that it might well have been improved with a more experienced cinema director such as Mann at the helm. Like The Naked Spur it was filmed against some striking Colorado landscapes but the photography never seems as effective as it did in the earlier film.There are some better things about the film James Stewart's own performance is perfectly adequate and he receives good support from some of the other actors such as Dan Duryea as the Kid's fellowgangster Whitey. Night Passage must however rank as one of the less memorable of Stewart's Westerns not in the same class as his best work with Mann or some of his later films in the genre such as Cheyenne Autumn or Firecreek. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "With Night Passage you get Jimmy Stewart uncharacteristically playing an accordion and singing a few songs and Audie Murphy in another one of his baby face villain roles. You also have Dan Duryea in a costarring effort but you have to wonder if he might have been hard of hearing during filming. He shouts every single one of his lines except one as I was so curious about his over the top manner that I started to keep track. It actually distracted me at times because I kept wondering why he was yelling all the time.I also had to wonder why Jimmy Stewart appeared to be out of breath after his first encounter with villain Concho Robert J. Wilke while saving young Joey Brandon De Wilde from a thrashing. At fifty one perhaps he wasn't in as good shape as he should have been to be riding horses and chasing down bad guys.As for the story it's fairly formulaic with Stewart and Murphy as brothers on opposite sides of the law a theme done countless times in Westerns. There's not much new to add here either and as I've noted earlier Murphy doesn't have the face to be taken seriously as a villain the same being true for his portrayal as gunman Gant in the 1959 film No Name On The Bullet. Try picturing Roy Rogers as a bad guy. See it just doesn't work.It was cool to see veteran Jack Elam as part of the Whitey Harbin gang and whenever I see Hugh Beaumont in a nonWard Cleaver role I have to wonder what the 'Beav' is up to. Not a bad film with some great Colorado scenery on display but truthfully the most emotion this got out of me was seeing Grant McLaine's Stewart accordion go up in flames. That was hard for this Polish boy.Say here's something to wonder about. As Miss Charlotte Dianne Foster pines for The Utica Kid Murphy throughout the film and she finally gets to hear that he wants to marry her why isn't she all torn up with the way the gun battle plays out? And brother Grant just moves right in?Ready for another good brotherbad brother match up with a railroad theme? Try 1949's The Last Bandit with Wild Bill Elliott and Forrest Tucker. No accordions in that one though you'll have to hum.".

And brother Grant just moves right in?Ready for another good brotherbad brother match up with a railroad theme? Try 1949's The Last Bandit with Wild Bill Elliott and Forrest Tucker. No accordions in that one though you'll have to hum.";

It's a hardhitting tragedy the type of film that Hollywood greenlighters can't reject FAST enough.The film is based on the late stages of the life of director Oskar Roehler's mother prominent German novelist and devout Leninist Giseta Elsner.

She comes across uncannily as a reallife Norma Desmond from SUNSET BOULEVARD  a selfindulgent onceprominent woman with garish tastes who is fighting a losing battle with a major midlife crisis.  For Desmond the advent of talking pictures meant no roles to play for Giseta Elsner the fall of East Germany meant  no place to go.  She tried resettling in the new Berlin but found herself to be an anachronism who just didn't fit in at all.Hannelore Elsner no relation to the reallife character gives a performance that's every bit as convincing as Gloria Swanson's was as Desmond.  And if you're a fan of blackandwhite cinematography I can't recommend Haden Bodganski's work here highly enough it'll NEVER survive the transition to the small screen trust me.

She decides to move to Berlin to start over with her former lover but everything has changed so profoundly that she just cannot find her place in the world anymore.Even though at first the movie seems like a primarily societal one the politics provide only the backdrop for Hanna's personal journey and the examination of feelings of alienation in the modern world. The beautiful classy black  white cinematography and the mise en scne emphasize Hanna's loneliness and the film focuses entirely on her. She meets a lot of people on her travels both old friends and relatives as well as new acquaintances but none of them stay in the picture for long and very few understand how she feels about the DDR or life in general. They all have different views on the events thus providing a look into the minds of ordinary Germans of the era so in the end the film does have a strong societal level too despite the main attention being on personal feelings.The character of Hanna Flanders is based on director Roehler's mother German writer Gisela Elsner who committed suicide in 1992 so I can imagine the film having been a very personal project for Roehler. Luckily his strong directorial style makes the story appealing to the general public too and not just to those familiar with Elsner's life and works. Hannelore Elsner no relation to Gisela Elsner despite the name also does a very convincing job in showing Hanna Flanders' emotions throughout the film. I think I can safely recommend No Place to Go to anyone who is into bleak depressing portrayals of anxiety and loneliness but the presentation of the social climate of the era should also fascinate those who are interested in the Division of Germany and the end of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Unberhrbare or Umnachtung or No Place to Go is a German movie from 2000 so not that long anymore until it has its 20th anniversary already. This one won Best Picture at the German Film Awards that year and it seems they also liked blackandwhite films back then. But that's really all it has in common with more recent winners Oh Boy or Das weie Band. For writer and director Oskar Roehler as well as lead actress Hannelore Elsner it is among their careerdefining works for Elsner maybe number one even. She has appeared in more famous films but she never was really in it from start to finish playing a character as she does here. The great deal of awards attention and the fact that this got selected to represent Getmany at the Oscars are helping too. But the Academy made the right decision in not nominating it. It is not the problem that the film is very sterile and bleak from start to finish of its 110 minutes. The problem is really that the story does not justify the running time. I am still undecided about Elsner's performance if it was good or bad something inbetween I guess. The character is a lot about the makeup I guess. The supporting characters are just as forgettable as Flanders pretty much all of them. The ending may be shocking but not entirely unexpected. I guess thanks to the last shot many forgot how mediocre it had been all the time.I usually like blackandwhite films and I also find the genre German history  GDR interesting in many other German movies but here not at all the way it was depicted. Then again the story randomly switched away from that and all that stayed was the aimless of the main character that still had to do with the initial subject. Quite a shame as stories about people in the center of the action regretting the Fall of the Berlin Wall are still a rarity these days so the plot idea definitely offered the opportunity for a very good and relevant movie especially as when this was made the Reunification was only a decade ago if at all. But they missed out as really none of the production values left a lasting impression here. Quite a shame. There is a lot of superior stuff out there by both Roehler and Elsner. I give their work here a thumbsdown and don't recommend checking it out.".

As shallow and self centered as Hanna is I still felt some pity for her as a fellow human being.".

Well I felt disappointed. I mean I agree with the main point of the reviews that is to say the extraordinary performance of Hannelore Elsner as the main character a leninistic writer smoke and sleeping pillsaddicted who just after the fall of the wall decides to leave the capitalistic Federal Republic of Germany and to move to the socialistic East Berlin. But of course the wall is fallen and she cannot find herself anymore also in her dreamed on world. I am afraid that the main trouble with this movie is the uncapability to create a really living character notwithstanding Mrs. Elsner's efforts and the complete unconsistency of the secondary characters like her boyfriend or her son or her former lover. Besides the screenplay has too many holes for instance at the beginning she has all her furniture removed from her house in Munich because she is leaving but where is she sending them? I mean we must not know any particular of the life of any character for instance Bresson did not care at all about it... but it is difficult to sympathize with a character who only speaks with slogans. And what about her outfits? What are they here for just to present the woman as a relict from the 68ers revolt with a Christian Dior overcoat...? Or was she a novel Norma Desmond wandering in her delirium? In that case a more baroque scenery should have been more suitable. And last but not least the cinematography has annoyed me I love black and white but in this case it was that kind of arty black and white which reminds me more of some Madonna videoclips than of movie classics.

	schema:headline " More than party doctrine and propaganda";
	schema:reviewBody "The film Die Unbesiegbaren covers an episode in German history in which the Bismarck government tried to mitigate the rise of the socialdemocrat movement. On the one hand the government developed her own social provisions in order to satisfy the demands and needs of the workers. On the other hand a law was passed Sozialistengesetz 18781890 in which the socialdemocrat party lost the right to form affiliate organizations to hold mass meetings and to make propaganda. The organizations were forced to continue underground while hoodwinking the spies of the Prussian police. Nonetheless the socialdemocrat party SPD was allowed to remain present in the Reichstag with a fraction of 11 under the leadership of the famous duo August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht. In those days the socialdemocrats had not yet abolished the possibility of the road to power by means of a revolution. One should bear in mind that the European turmoil of 1848 was not forgotten and that in the year 1870 France still saw the temporary establishment of the peoples Commune in Paris. Not even the leaders were exempt from persecution and Liebknecht spent some time in prison because of his statements. Note that the SPD had always included a right wing of Lassallian reformists but only around 1900 did this wing gain in strength among other due to the writings of Eduard Bernstein. Basically the SPD buried its revolutionary ambitions around 1913 together with the deceased Bebel. In 1919 the party decided to participate in the government. The episode of the Sozialistengesetz contains plenty of material for an emotional and exciting film. Somehow the illustrious Defa studios in the GDR did not quite live up to this task since the script creates a rather languid atmosphere. The main character is the train mechanic Schulz one of the lower party executives who is active as messenger boy or pamphlet printer. He is a portrayed as a quiet person calls his wife mother and is bright enough to deceive the police and their eavesdroppers. Finally he is caught while distributing pamphlets and is imprisoned for 11 months. At the precise day of his release the Sozialistengesetz is abolished. So what is wrong with this film? Well perhaps that the dialogs and the relationships have a strong resemblance with the average Heinz Ruehmann film. Somewhere in this site a reviewer compared the characters in the Defa films during the fifties with dull and dusty officials and I agree. Don't expect to see much emotions. In Europe and especially in Germany there was still that desire for law and order where every person knows his place and willingly adapts himself after all Hitler was barely dead. For those who have not had the pleasure to see a Ruehmann film searching for an American equivalent one might compare it with the atmosphere in the traditional religious communities. Or in those cozy little towns of European settlers in Western movies which were religious anyway. And it is true that many films suffer by the excessive emotionality of the main characters. Whining and screaming persons may get their wants satisfied but generate little sympathy. From time to time the Bolshevist ideology pops up. This is the case for instance in the ridicule of the SPD fraction member Karl Frohme who advocates negotiations with the Emperor. Here the filmBebel sneers down with the reply that dissidents shall be expelled from the party a typical Leninist reaction. It is just to serve the people but Frohme had the wrong ambition added the filmBebel thank you!. Here Frohme symbolizes the collision between the ideologies of the postWar BRD socialist SPD and the GDR communist Bolshevist SED. Typical is also the unshakable belief that the revolution is near which is so apparent in the title The invincibles. This of course refers to the class war. The Bolshevists enjoyed false heroism hero of works etc. and disliked the common sense of the perpetual motion of the political goals which are so necessary for the incorporation of the experiences along the road. Evidently the film was destined to strengthen the identity of the newborn GDR. But the comment of the Viennese Filmschau 1953 two hours of party doctrine and propaganda is definitely of the mark. The WestGerman actor Alice Treff participated in the film as Frau Schulz and barely escaped from an occupational lockout in her own land. Erwin Geschonneck plays Wilhelm Liebkecht. Verdict the film is not bad but rather boring and still has some value and interest because of its taste of the period.".

He is a portrayed as a quiet person calls his wife mother and is bright enough to deceive the police and their eavesdroppers. Finally he is caught while distributing pamphlets and is imprisoned for 11 months. At the precise day of his release the Sozialistengesetz is abolished. So what is wrong with this film? Well perhaps that the dialogs and the relationships have a strong resemblance with the average Heinz Ruehmann film. Somewhere in this site a reviewer compared the characters in the Defa films during the fifties with dull and dusty officials and I agree. Don't expect to see much emotions. In Europe and especially in Germany there was still that desire for law and order where every person knows his place and willingly adapts himself after all Hitler was barely dead. For those who have not had the pleasure to see a Ruehmann film searching for an American equivalent one might compare it with the atmosphere in the traditional religious communities. Or in those cozy little towns of European settlers in Western movies which were religious anyway. And it is true that many films suffer by the excessive emotionality of the main characters. Whining and screaming persons may get their wants satisfied but generate little sympathy. From time to time the Bolshevist ideology pops up. This is the case for instance in the ridicule of the SPD fraction member Karl Frohme who advocates negotiations with the Emperor. Here the filmBebel sneers down with the reply that dissidents shall be expelled from the party a typical Leninist reaction. It is just to serve the people but Frohme had the wrong ambition added the filmBebel thank you!. Here Frohme symbolizes the collision between the ideologies of the postWar BRD socialist SPD and the GDR communist Bolshevist SED. Typical is also the unshakable belief that the revolution is near which is so apparent in the title The invincibles. This of course refers to the class war. The Bolshevists enjoyed false heroism hero of works etc. and disliked the common sense of the perpetual motion of the political goals which are so necessary for the incorporation of the experiences along the road. Evidently the film was destined to strengthen the identity of the newborn GDR. But the comment of the Viennese Filmschau 1953 two hours of party doctrine and propaganda is definitely of the mark. The WestGerman actor Alice Treff participated in the film as Frau Schulz and barely escaped from an occupational lockout in her own land. Erwin Geschonneck plays Wilhelm Liebkecht. Verdict the film is not bad but rather boring and still has some value and interest because of its taste of the period.";
