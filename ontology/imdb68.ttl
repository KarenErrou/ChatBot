The plot is kinda simple  18yearold heir Kang Jaekyung played by Bin Hyeon is a spoiled brat who is used to getting everything he wants. Alas he will be entitled to his grandfather's millions only if he will graduate at particular school in particular place. At first he is being rebellious and all but then he realizes that he's seeing this girl Choi Eunwhan played by Yeonhee Lee more often. Of course the title suggests that he will fall in love. But it's trickier than it seems because Eunwhan has a heartdisease and then the changes begin.Everything is shown with such kindness and disengagement that it has ALMOST made me cry. I mean  ME and I never cry during movies. What else. Well nice job of director of photography and editor. Really nice. Also the OST is like wow. Do I have to tell you that I have the theme song on my playlist?  And it is sung by Kim Jaejoong!! My baby 3 3  the whole TVXQ Dong Bang Shin Ki crew at the credits. Needless to say that I also have piano sheet music of Insa theme song and can read most of it in Hangul  So yeah if you want to see some true natural and not exaggerated romance this movie is for you. And guys it has some fighting scenes as well ".

I will be eagerly awaiting any new movies she will be in.Moving on to the actual movie I was afraid this would be some sort of corny excuse to plaster the media with Hyunbin's face however the movie itself is quite good.The short but sweet love story really picks up in the 2nd half of the film. I would cry and laugh at the same time our lead and ingnue did. Very few movies leave me satisfied at the way the movie concluded this is one of them.Give it a shot if not for the surprisingly good movie albeit horribly titled then for the ridiculously cute actress in her acting debut.".

When I sat down to watch the DVD it was 1100 PM and I'll admit I was sort of putting off watching the movie I just didn't feel like going through the headache of watching the film and reading the subs at the same time. The first 30 minutes into the film I became engrossed the arrogant yet hot rich boy made me want to slap some sense into him and kiss his cheek at the same time. When Eue was introduced I immediately fell in love with how cute and sweet she was. The acting was believable and the process of Jae and Eue falling in love left me feeling melty and gooey inside. In my head I pictured a happy ending with a wedding and flowers and happy little animals everywhere like something out of a Disney movie. So when the course of the movie was altered when Eue admitted that being with Jae made her heart condition worse the tears started flowing. It was so sudden one minute I'm just watching a sweet movie about love and the next moment I'm crying so hard I'm starting to heave. I didn't notice I was crying until the very end when Jae is at the graduation ceremony and in Eue's chair lays a bunch of flowers. I've never cried so hard during a movie except during the Titanic and sometimes even then do I finish the movie driedeyed. This movie is defiantly for the romanticatheart. Since watching this movie I've gone on seeing such movies as My Sassy Girl and 200 Pounds Beauty. I will always love this movie and recommend to everyone.

	schema:reviewBody "Millionaire's First Love is a movie about a High School student that must fulfill a contract clause in order to obtain his inheritance. He was sent to a rural High School to change his ways and live like an normal person would. In the process he meets a girl with whom he falls in love with. The film works on the story of change that Jae Kyungthe millionaire has to undergo. The film works well with the mix of drama and comedy. Aside from that it adds romance in the process. What makes this film atypical as compared to the other films. I think that the film works on how it tells its story. It generates the viewers interest and the actors and actresses are effective in generating sympathy for the characters they portray. In the end it works wonders despite the fact that it employs formula that are used before in other films. Credit that to the participants of the film. It may not be a masterpiece but the subject of change has always been familiar for many movie themes and it attracts various people from different age groups and culture. Although I personally do believe that there are many better films than this and it is not a masterpiece like other Asian films like My Sassy GirlOldboy and Infernal Affairs I still consider this a mustsee. It is highly recommended. A 910 rating is fair.".

What makes this film atypical as compared to the other films. I think that the film works on how it tells its story. It generates the viewers interest and the actors and actresses are effective in generating sympathy for the characters they portray. In the end it works wonders despite the fact that it employs formula that are used before in other films. Credit that to the participants of the film. It may not be a masterpiece but the subject of change has always been familiar for many movie themes and it attracts various people from different age groups and culture. Although I personally do believe that there are many better films than this and it is not a masterpiece like other Asian films like My Sassy GirlOldboy and Infernal Affairs I still consider this a mustsee. It is highly recommended. A 910 rating is fair.";

	schema:reviewBody "Up until watching A Millionaire's First Love Hachi was quite possibly the saddest movie I had the privilege of viewing. This South Korean romantic drama however may take home the prize of being the first feature that reduced me to tears for a majority of its story. Those who have seen My Sassy Girl may remember the moment Gyeonwoo explained to the Girl how South Koreans appreciate melodrama. Clearly there is some truth behind this logic and A Millionaire's First Love contains a rich assortment of powerfully beautiful and sad moments that will certainly cause a number of intense emotions to flourish. More powerful than A Walk to Remember and more romantic than Here on Earth A Millionaire's First Love is a story of romance life family and the choices that all of us make.During the opening scene though you could be forgiven for thinking you stumbled into a martial arts film by accident with the fight that dominates the screen. This however serves the purpose to show how the reckless Kang Jaekyung Hyun Nin a soon to be millionaire who is as pretentious as he is arrogant spends much of his time. His friends and acquaintances who occupy this spoiled existence with him are largely unexplored despite appearing on more than one occasion and the connection between he and a rich young woman who believes herself to be his paramour is strangely peculiar in that not even the characters appear capable of comprehending this subplot.At the same time though we are introduced to Choi Eunhwan Yeonhee Lee who lives a very different existence. Emotional but at the same time strong in spirit she doesn't have the luxurious upbringing that Jaekyung has been gifted. Despite this both of these characters coincidentally meet.Originally difficult to follow due to the lack of background the audience is provided a thorough backstory is eventually revealed which magnifies the intense feelings that continuously tug at the viewer's heart strings. Each of the images behaviors and items have a place in the story these been purposefully revealed in the beginning stages of the film only to be later put in perspective.Jaekyung's life of luxury is however thwarted by none other than his deceased grandfather whose inheritance he was destined to receive. Informed by his lawyer that he needs to graduate from a predetermined school before receiving the wealthy entitlement he finds that all he had taken for granted is denied to him. Sent to a school far from civilization he discovers Eunhwan the young woman he met in the city is a student there as well their relationship being the focus of the film.Through her Jaekyung is able to acquire for himself an appreciation for life's beauty entering a world where ten dollars is capable of purchasing more happiness than he has experienced in a lifetime. These tender moments combined with the brilliant acting by the leads who demonstrate an exceptional emotional range the indepth writing of the story and the feature's extraordinary direction makes A Millionaire's First Love a film that is as poetic as it is memorable.Although there may be room to argue that some of the plot is exaggerated and overacted for the most part A Millionaire's First Love is as terribly sad as it is incalculably beautiful. I personally spent over half of this film in a state of tears with over a dozen tissues been sacrificed to stem the flow of liquid. To put it simply if you take umbrage at films that may reduce you to an emotional mess you might want to consider avoiding this feature.Sometimes funny sometimes sad but always honestly romantic and charming those who appreciate South Korean drama or romantic films in general will find this is one feature that simply must be included in their collection.".

The acting was superbly done for me personally despite the possible clichs.There are some fight scenes some stupid scenes and some really sweet romantic scenes.It had some funny but mainly sweet and sad moments. Its definitely a tear jerker. My favourite part is when they stay in their house together waiting.Overall one worth watching.".

Knowing now the clichs of illnesses and love in Korean romance I have to say this was on of my faves and still is. The acting was superbly done for me personally despite the possible clichs.There are some fight scenes some stupid scenes and some really sweet romantic scenes.It had some funny but mainly sweet and sad moments. Its definitely a tear jerker. My favourite part is when they stay in their house together waiting.Overall one worth watching.";

The objective is to find a flower Blood Orchid that flourishes for a couple of weeks every seven years and could be a fountain of youth prolonging the expectation of life of human beings. They are succeeded and once in Borneo they realize that it is the raining season and there is no boat available to navigate on the river. They pay US 50000.00 to convince Captain Bill Johnson and his partner Tran to sail to the location. After an accident in a waterfall the survivors realize that a pack of anacondas have gathered for mating and their nest is nearby the plantation of Blood Orchid which made them bigger and bigger.";

If there has ever been a more culturally diverse group of noname actors to brave the jungles of Borneo then I'll end my movie reviewing career right now future users of the Alan Smithee pseudonym applaud. All right I've kept this secret but I actually sat in on a production meeting for Anacondas and here's how it went downAnnoying black dude who just screams the whole time?Check. But let's put a tough black dude in there as well. Don't wanna be accused of stereotyping.Good idea. Who is Morris Chestnut?Well we thought it was a brand of chewing tobacco but he's actually who we're gonna use as our tough black guy.Oh OK. How about a Latino woman with an unnecessarily bad attitude?You mean the JLo wannabe? Check.Good. Did y'all find that toughlooking Asian guy?Check. It wasn't easy but we found one with a mullet.Perfect. That'll alert everybody that he's not one of those brainy Asians. How about a blonde babe with a thick fake Southern accent?Check. She's from Georgia but her accent sounded too realistic. We told her to fake it up.Good job. And I saw that you found a white European male but how about the protagonist?Oh you mean the muscular white guy with a 2day beard growth and husky voice? Check. He's in wardrobe right now having the sleeves on his tight shirt rolled up.Perfect. Just don't forget the tattoos. Now how about somebody who's actually famous?Um well we don't exactly have that. But hey we've got everything else! And that my friends is your cast. Some other guy of some sort of foreign descent was thrown in there as well. He looked like Gregg Rainwater from The Young Riders. He died soon enough so it doesn't really matter.My money says you really won't care about anybody involved in this production. Well I did like the southern girl. She was pretty hot. But why do producers insist on accents being so fake? Her accent dwindled as the movie went along. She eventually was only accenting about one word per sentence but by the climax she started fakin' it up with reckless abandon!And I'm sure plenty of girls will think Johnny Five O'Clock Shadow Messner is pretty hot but for the most part you'll spend the first 10 minutes of the movie picking which characters you want to see swallowed whole by a giant anaconda. My first choice was the Jennifer Lopez wannabe. When Bmovie characters like her prance around with a huge chip on their shoulder I usually pray for some sort of creature to sneak up and bite that chip right off. Along with the entire shoulder.This is one of those movies that relies on every clich in the Bmovie book. In other words you can expect a whole lot of stuff like a door opening slowly and then something jumping out while a loud noise is made. And since this is a creature feature by definition a lot of the action takes place at night in dark caves and in water with only flashlights to light the way.Dialogue is expectedly bad. We're treated to such intellectuallychallenged exchanges as What's wrong with this picture? You're in it. And it's mostly dominated by Messner's Michael Paresque line delivery and Eugene Byrd's bansheelike screeching. It's funny up to a point but eventually you start looking at your watch and thinking OK snake it's time to eat this kid.The CGI looks a little goofy at times but most of it is well done thanks to the wise decision to hide the flaws with darkness and water. If you're wondering how this compares to the original Anaconda well the two really have nothing to do with each other except for presence of an anaconda. The first movie had famous people in it this one doesn't. However this one does have more anacondas! It's been 7 years since I saw the original but I'm pretty sure it's the better of the two.My biggest complaint is that Anacondas wasn't cheesy ENOUGH! If you're gonna be bad then go as far out on the cheesy limb as you can go! Instead of a blood orchid their research should've discovered a rare Indonesian banana that held the secret to long life. Then once it was discovered the anacondas were eating these things and living forever one of the bad actors could've deadpanned What are these things? Bananacondas? BWAHAHAHAHA! Man I really need to start writing screenplays for intentionally bad movies.And I've said this before but I'll say it again. Since versus movies are the current sequel trend they should've dug up Harrison Ford it's been four years since the guy had a hit given him the Jack Ryan moniker again and given us Jack Ryan Vs. Anaconda The Hunt for the Blood Red Orchid in October. He could've been the guide for the scientists and when one of them started whining he could've cracked Traveling through Borneo ain't like dusting crops boy. Then he would've looked into the camera and winked. It'd have been awesome and you know it.Oh and let me leave with a word of advice. If a bad guy is standing near the edge of an anaconda pit and he's holding a gun on one of your colleagues but his back is to you then please for the love of all that is holy instead of whimpering like someone forced to sit through a post1987 Corey Feldman movie stand up and kick the guy in the pit.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rating  12 out of As if further proof that I am in serious need of better taste I was actually looking forward to seeing this movie not so much because I was expecting anything great but because I'm a sucker for bigstudio jungleset adventures. The fact that it's got giant snakes can only help and heck this movie's own predecessor wasn't halfbad. All things considered Anacondas was about on par with what I expected cheese but reasonably watchable cheese. In the hopes of becoming millionaires a group of young attractive researchers hire a boat whose captain is expectedly hardboiled and hunky to take them into the jungles of Borneo in search of the rare Blood Orchid a flower with the ability to prolong life but the catch is that it blooms for only a six month period every seven years and they're approaching the last few weeks of that time span. The expedition's boat sinks in a mishap involving a waterfall leaving the group stranded and easy prey for the freakishly large anacondas in the vicinity.The title Anacondas suggests probably a bit more than even the movie can deliver with the first genuine snake attack barring the opening credits not even occurring until the fortyminute mark and even then it's not for another halfhour until someone from the same group is munched on by one of those slithery reptiles. There's a surprisingly bare minimum utilization of the titular creatures though I suspect that has a lot to do with budgetary limitations.If there's anything I expected to be a vast improvement upon the original it'd be the visual rendering of the anacondas but they're actually a few steps backward from the already spotty work in the original. For costeffective purposes virtually all the effects are CGI and they're only a tiny bit better than what one would expect from a SciFi Pictures Original. Making the snakes larger also works against the effects making them goofier and harder to take seriously as a genuine threat.Worse the snakes themselves seem a lot wimpier despite those advancements. The anacondas have been essentially mutated by the Blood Orchid so they're understandably larger at least twice so than the snakes in the original and probably a lot longer as well. Unfortunately they're also inexplicably much easier to kill this time around. One whack from a machete used by someone who's never wielded one before in her life is enough to hack off one of these monstrosities' heads clean off. One of the snakes even manages to explode after being set alight by gasoline and a flare. And correct me if I'm wrong but when did anacondas actually have teeth?The movie's various roles and characters are as stereotypical and obvious as one can expect from the genre. There's the hunky male American with his haunting past and he's got a hunky Asian sidekickfirst mate. There's the serious black guy and the comic relief black guy the latter of whom is probably the most obnoxious character I've seen in film all year. There's also the serious chick with depth and the whiny chick. In performing these roles the cast is almost all terrible especially Johnny Messner as the lead the only modicum of acting talent coming from Morris Chestnut and the promising Kadee Strickland.While I've done nothing but harp on the movie the biggest praise I can shower it with is that it's rarely boring. From the lush jungle scenery to the splendid visuals of the snakes right under the surface of the water Anacondas is at least a movie that's always nice to look at. Even if it's never genuinely exciting or suspenseful there are a few cheap thrills and a fast pace that doesn't let up. I suspect very undemanding and forgiving genre fans might even like it and it's to them I would even consider recommending this movie. Everyone else should first set their expectations straight.".

	schema:reviewBody "Series note Although this is the second film in the Anaconda series there is no need to watch the films in order. They are merely thematic companions sharing some similarities of plot and structure. They are not constructed as chapters in a novel.When it is discovered that an exotic flower found only in Borneo and blooming only every seven years may hold the key to life extension a large pharmaceutical company sends a team of researchers to acquire samples for study. Making the task thornier the samples must be obtained while the plant is in bloom and as the film begins it will only be in bloom a few more weeks. In increasing layers of difficulty it's rainy season in Borneo and only Bill Johnson Johnny Messner is crazy enough to take the team upriver in his ramshackle boat before the season ends despite the fact that they're offering 50000 and as they make their way upstream of course the team runs into giant anacondas of the type found in the first film.Like Anaconda Anacondas has been getting a fairly bad rap and I can't quite figure out why. Sure some people have complained about inaccuracies in the films when compared to facts in the actual world but seriously what's wrong with anyone who'd expect fictional films like Anacondas to be educational or largely a documentary? The films are basically monster flicks with the degree of predictability that usually entails but what would one be expecting otherwise? Both films are certainly internally consistent with captivating stories fine performances and well executed technical aspectsdirecting editing production design cinematography particularly beautiful in this entry and the Fijian landscapes are often breathtaking and so on.And in fact Anacondas has much more than just competent artistry. From the first frames to the last this is one heck of a thrill ride with plot twists and turns around every corner mimicking the river and the coils of the titular beast. It has basically nonstop suspense it cleverly incorporates horror elements from psycho humans to haunted houses the caves and the village they come across near the climax are basically haunted houses in structure and tone. A number of sequences will stick in your mind for a long time such as the intense waterfall scene and the great wading scene. There are also poignant subtexts about materialism and the desire to be immortal versus emotional and pragmatic concern for fellow humans. The new writing team even manages to insert thoughtprovoking dilemmas related to utilitarianism.There are a number of interesting parallels to Anaconda 1997 with an equally interesting and capable motley crew of characters played by a skilled cast. It may be a different locale but the gist is still an Apocalypse Now 1979styled trip up a river where the complexly interacting crew must encounter and overcome various obstacles not the least of which are members of their own group including initially veiled villains who are as much of a snake as the more literal reptilian villains. Director Dwight H. Little also gives us an amusing alternate world take on Anaconda's Paul Sarone inimitably performed in that film by Jon Voight in Anacondas' short lived John Livingston Andy Anderson whose name ties us in to famed 19th Century African explorer David Livingstone and the many filmic depictions of the same including The Lost Jungle 1934 and Stanley and Livingstone 1939. That's not the only references to classics as Bill Johnson's boat The Bloody Mary a character in its own right has stylistic similarities to Charlie Allnut's African Queen from the 1951 film of the same name and the overall journey has resemblances to Disney's Jungle Cruise.While the attack scenes may not be quite as clearly filmed and smoothly cut as the first film Little and his editors make up for it by increasing the number and quality of gradually building suspense sequences where we see a snake through water or in other environments while our protagonists initially overlook them. The digital effects are probably better than the first film and the mechanicalanimatronics effects are close in quality. In addition Little incorporated many shots of real anacondas.If you at all enjoyed the first film you should enjoy this one as well. It's important to watch films like Anacondas without inappropriate expectations. In my view Little and crew have accomplished exactly what they set out to docreate an intense thrillride of a monster flick with touches of humor and deeper subtexts that's a worthy stylistic and thematic successor to the first film.".

	schema:reviewBody "A research expedition into Borneo to locate the rare Black Orchid in bloom is hampered by torrential rain and the appearance of several extremely large and equally hungry anacondas. The Black Orchid possesses a chemical compound equivalent to a 'fountain of youth' and worth billions to those who can discover and propagate it for human consumption. So when the group's vessel The Bloody Mary is submerged after taking a tumble over a waterfall they elect to continue in search of the fatal flower and onebyone die regretting that decision.Entertaining if not altogether cogent followup to the JLo enhanced actionhorror Anaconda that spawned a glut of 'big snake' movies for a decade thereafter. Reasonable cast of characters mostly play to type as they're hunted down with the makers inventing new and exciting ways for the cast to be turned into tube stuffing. Johnny Messner's hero is surprisingly capable of expressing fear responsibility and uncertainty in contrast to the usual one dimensional bravado. Much less can be said for Matthew Marsden's rendition of the evil expedition leader whose desire to cashin on the onceinalifetime discovery unveils a reckless selfish determination that leads to sabotage murder and shocking cruelty. KaDee Strickland emerges as the film's heroine and despite her Southern drawl and youthful good looks belying her role as a preeminent scientist her presence is a welcome contrast from Salli RichardsonWhitfield's overblown corporate deal maker.The scenery like the first film is lush and vivid and the action sequences are well choreographed and executed. Whilst there's some weak attempts at humour and the occasional graphically depicted fatality generally this is a conventional actionhorror that plays by the rules remaining tense and exciting throughout. Monkey enthusiasts might also get a chuckle out of Konga the resident cheeky chimp on the Bloody Mary.".

So when the group's vessel The Bloody Mary is submerged after taking a tumble over a waterfall they elect to continue in search of the fatal flower and onebyone die regretting that decision.Entertaining if not altogether cogent followup to the JLo enhanced actionhorror Anaconda that spawned a glut of 'big snake' movies for a decade thereafter. Reasonable cast of characters mostly play to type as they're hunted down with the makers inventing new and exciting ways for the cast to be turned into tube stuffing. Johnny Messner's hero is surprisingly capable of expressing fear responsibility and uncertainty in contrast to the usual one dimensional bravado. Much less can be said for Matthew Marsden's rendition of the evil expedition leader whose desire to cashin on the onceinalifetime discovery unveils a reckless selfish determination that leads to sabotage murder and shocking cruelty. KaDee Strickland emerges as the film's heroine and despite her Southern drawl and youthful good looks belying her role as a preeminent scientist her presence is a welcome contrast from Salli RichardsonWhitfield's overblown corporate deal maker.The scenery like the first film is lush and vivid and the action sequences are well choreographed and executed. Whilst there's some weak attempts at humour and the occasional graphically depicted fatality generally this is a conventional actionhorror that plays by the rules remaining tense and exciting throughout. Monkey enthusiasts might also get a chuckle out of Konga the resident cheeky chimp on the Bloody Mary.";

There are tighter suspense sequences reasonable acting and good visual effects. I tend to be fonder of anamatronic effects over CGI but these are pretty good. The original Anaconda had pretty good anamatronic snakes but just because of the nature of the animal they looked a bit hokey. They might have been scary if you were scared of snakes but otherwise they looked like big Muppet snakes who cracked up into big smiles every time they attacked.The CGI here lends itself to visually ridiculous touches like big fangs on snakes that don't naturally have big teeth but if you can watch this movie at all you will suspend your disbelief. Good fun good thrills no Oscars. Enjoy.".

This is one of those movies you can watch with a huge bucket of popcorn and some drinks.And I must say that the acting is actually as good as it can be in this kind of movie. Johnny Messner and Matthew Marsden did great and the others too actually. But Messner definitely was the right choice for lead in this movie. The acting here is much better than in Anaconda. Luckily for us Ice Cube wasn't asked to reprise his role The guy just can't act although he tries to. But he fails.This is probably Dwight H. Little's best movie to date.

The thrills is really good and some of it is surprising. The movie is filmed excellently. The special effects is also great. The music by Nerida TysonChew is outstanding.

The acting by all of these actors is very good. Messner is really excellent in this film. I thought that the performance by this muscular actor was great. The thrills is really good and some of it is surprising. The movie is filmed excellently. The special effects is also great. The music by Nerida TysonChew is outstanding.

Instead they end up encountering a bunch of deadly giant snakes protecting their prize.Anacondas is a fun movie to watch as long as you have your brain turned off. The original was a pretty corny horror film with a few entertaining moments. The sequel is more or less the same except no one from the first movie is back. I was actually a little disappointed with Anacondas. It wasn't as scary or funny as I thought it was going to be. The movie carried the same serious tone throughout the entire film and this got a little annoying. It could have had more fun with its premise but it followed the original. The story is very weak which is kind of weird since there were a bunch of writers working on it. Apparently they were all lazy since none of them bothered to look up where anacondas really live. This huge and noticeable geographical error was the most entertainment I got from the movie.The acting is a nonissue but lets just say no one is going to be winning an Oscar anytime soon. The only person to give an okay performance was KaDee Strickland though that's not really saying much. All the characters are really bad stereotypes and not a lot of thought went into them. Actually not a lot of thought went into anything. Nothing in this film really stands out. The death scenes are pretty lame and the special effects are really weak. The scenery is nice to look at though and the monkey is pretty funny. The movie is pretty short so it wasn't too much of a pain to sit through.The best way to approach Anacondas is to regard it as a cheesy monster movie. It may not be very entertaining but there were a few fun scenes. In the end Anacondas isn't really worth watching unless you are in the mood for a really cheesy and bad movie. Otherwise approach with caution. Rating 510".

	schema:reviewBody "I cant remember much about the original 'Anaconda' save for the fact that I didn't like it much but even so I knew going into this silly jungle adventure that I was going to enjoy myself. The Anaconda sequel goes the same way as Aliens in that it adds an 's' to the end of the original title instead of having a number 2 there. Unlike Aliens however this film isn't all that good. But then again...nobody expects it to be and in terms of the 'fun factor' Anacondas definitely does it's job. Many criticise this flick for the fact that it's not brilliant  but that's just stupid if you ask me. If you're expecting brilliance going into a sequel to a lowkey nineties horror thriller it's YOU who should be criticised. Anyway Anacondas spends about two minutes spread over one scene setting it's plot up and then we're off into the jungle. The plot revolves around as the subtitle suggests a hunt for a rare flower that supposedly has lifegiving qualities. But the real point of the film is people getting eaten by oversized snakes...The huge snakes are brought to life by computergenerated effects. For CGI the effects aren't too bad but as usual they completely fail to be impressive. The snakes look good while they're meandering through the water but when we get to see them properly they just look mundane. The film is of course set in the Amazon jungle and that is one of this film's main assets. The jungle always provides a great setting for thrillers because there's just so much wonder within it. Aside from snakes we also get spiders crocodiles and various other grisly beasts for out heroes to contend with. The cast is typically made up of unknowns and none of them really impress. Johnny Messner is the best of them and he takes the lead role as the rugged captain of the boat that takes the team of researchers through the jungle. On the whole Anacondas pretty much delivers what you would expect it to deliver. There's plenty of action plenty of snakes and not a lot in the way of plot or characters. Of course it doesn't matter and I can recommend this film to anyone that simply wants ninety minutes of easy viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the 80's South Korean films as well as TV dramas were almost identically typical in their monotonous plots stereotyped characters and lack of variety. True those were the dark agesruled by army generals with not much freedom of speech or media etc. However interestingly enough this movie in the 21st century democracy attempted to depict an unforgettable and unforgivable historical event of 1980 with the very 1980 methods monotonous stereotyped and boring... How typical! Unbelievable!

It is every bit as brilliant and as large as Memories of Murder in my opinion.In many ways this is the natural and equal followup to Memories of Murder. It's every bit the caper film that one was and although slightly more somber in tone the film keeps unraveling in directions you don't expect making it much more a plot driven movie than a character study. Kim Hyeja is however magnificent as the titular gawd I hate that word but I'm using it anyway mother. There is a scene in this film where she tells the family of the victim her son didn't do it and her eyes are so electrically charged it made me jump back from the screen. Mother fires on all cylinders. The direction cinematography script and acting are all grade A. It's one of those films where each of the secondary characters steals the show for a brief period. How 'bout that cop who kicks the apple from Won Bin's mouth? Bong does a remarkable job of populating the world of this film with real people and manages to give them depth and development in a very short period of time. I confess to having a little trouble tracking the other female characters in the film but no matter. There is a scene without spoiling anything here where Kim Hyeja asks the other 'retarded' kid if he has a mother and it's one of the most complex and heartrending scenes in cinematic history. Hyperbole notwithstanding just freakin' WOW! on that one when you ponder just why she is crying.I wasn't sure where Bong was going to end up going as a film maker. Barking Dogs Never Bite was a reasonable debut. Memories of Murder a masterpiece. But was it a lucky shot? I'm glad I don't have to consider the dismal Antarctic Journal a Bong film if I don't want to. The Host was lotsofun but that's the one that worried me.

	schema:reviewBody "JoonHo Bong is one of the most exciting and wonderful storytellers coming out of Asia today. With Mother he joins with Chanwook Park as being one of THE young South Korean directors to see  by that I mean anything they put out. Bong's work is layered with the skill of comedy and drama both often so dark and thick that you can put your hand in and not feel the bottom. His previous film The Host showed his talent at making a 'popular' entertainment a monster blockbuster that actually gave characters to care about while action and terror ensued. But this time he returns to his second feature Memories of Murder in crafting a murder mystery that is ultimately in the sense of the details of the story hopeless but carries so much joy and passion in its making that I left elated by the performances and cinematography.It is from the look of the premise pretty simple stuff. A kid who is sort of 'simple' not really retarded just slower than the rest of the pack with a bad memory is charged with a murder of a teenage girl found hanging over a rooftop. He says he didn't do it or at least doesn't think he did and his mother believes him. But finding out what happened won't be easy and the police as in Memories of Murder just want the confession quick which they get from Dojoon's misunderstanding and move along to the next case. So the Mother goes on a mystery like a detective first tracking his shady golfhustler friend then going on to who this girl who died actually was what her connections were who if anyone saw what happened when her son stumbled home drunk that fateful night.All of the details seemingly straightforward. It's all in the presentation of the details and it's this how Bong sets himself apart as an original taking elements of filmnoir and Greek tragedy of a mother trying to save her son and by proxy herself and warding off the chorus of a strange and untrustworthy townsfolk who shun her after the incident. Oh and like in other Bong films there's some touches of pitch black humor watch for that interrogation scene of the teenage punk on the ferris wheel or how that crazy hitandrun happens at the start of the film but it's either subtle or pronounced so large that one almost puts it down to hysterics. But while Bong navigates the blackcomic elements well it's his skill as a HitchcockcumChabrol idolizer that makes it a mustsee.This is suspenseful filmmaking from the overall arc of finding out the details of the crime to little moments that are just suffocating. Take when the Mother goes to search the complex lowlife JinTae's place to find possible proof that he committed the murder. She has to hide in the closet when he comes in Blue Velvet much? and watch as JinTae and his girlfriend have sex. Later she has to exit ever so slightly and knocks over a water bottle. Every second of this counts and it's thanks to Bong's trust in the view to be lead along and go for the tension that makes it work.Other things that make the film so exceptional are more technical and emotional. The performances by Hyeja Kim and Bin Won are moving for how they appear to be then little by little how they show who they are and more importantly what they're capable of. The final reel of the film shows the characters and by proxy the actors having to go through some rough motions and a twist that makes Oldboy look well almost onpar in comparison. Kim is sensitive tough smart but also knowing of this Mother's faults as a person that she may have a little of the 'simple' side of her own son and the secret her character carries when reveals is shocking. And Bin playing a simple kid with some deeprooted problems and of course never call the character 'retard' makes him human and relatable or as Kirk Lazarus might put it halfretard.The cinematography lastly is a knockout. Scenes like the opening image of the Mother in a field doing an unlikely dance to the diegetic music and then how the DoP manages between light and dark in those night scenes or the subtle scenes like when the lawyer has the Mother at a drinking party that goes sour fast are just beautiful and strange to look at. This may too be a credit to Bong as a director. Again following along on his previous films he grows as a patient storyteller ready to let the details or action of a scene go slowly but also ready to let the actors take things to BIG emotional plateaus. It should be noted that Mother does go into some melodramatic beats sometimes very heavily but it's never at a cheap shot or angle. Mother is a harrowing film that treats its characters seriously but also gives time here and there to observe how awfully bizarre some of it is. It's one of the best of the year.".

The director Joonho Bong of Gwoemul makes a simple but effective film with a credible story of a single woman that does everything possible and impossible to prove the innocence of her son that is slow probably because he was poisoned when he was five. The performance of Hyeja Kim deserves a nomination to the Oscar in the role of a dedicated loving mother that pursues the truth about the murder of a teenager student. With the exception of one review of a user that probably has difficulties to read subtitles the nine wins six nominations and the favorable reviews of twentythree IMDb users are practically an unanimous indication that Madeo is a great film indeed.

	schema:headline " Hilarious and insightful mystery an emotional cornucopia";
	schema:reviewBody "Bong manages to capture some of the poignancy of motherhood in his film Mother which concerns an elderly single mother played by Hyeja Kim and her son Yoon Dojoon played by Bin Won. Dojoon is mentally disabled he has a low intelligence and seems to have problems with his memory. His mother is absolutely devoted to her son. Bong throws light on that extraordinary capacity of some women to totally subjugate their own lives to those of their children who live for the pep that they get seeing often unappreciative family members troughing their way through their latest offering.Dojoon is framed up fairly early on by the police for a murder that they can't really be bothered to investigate thoroughly. So mum is on the case you'd better believe it! This involves for example bringing in drinks for all the members of the detective bureau on a visit to the precinct. There's a lot of tragedy in the movie but it's offset by a comedy that is at times is almost outrageous in it's manipulativeness Bong's really being directly provocative at times though not in a salacious sense! There's a grand surreal scene at one point where he convinces you that a very minor character is going to perform a deeply uncanny suicide and then something totally banal happens instead. One of my favourite scenes is a scene on a golf course where a shot dollys across to some action taking place in sugarwhite bunkers which would not be out of place in a Fellini movie.Bong was playing with my emotions throughout he set up affiliations between me and other characters only to subvert them or rebuild them later he builds scenes to emotional explosiveness just for the sake of it. The film leaves you emotionally confused at times Bong's smashing all the buttons on the telephone and so you don't really know what number is being dialled. The effect is deliberate.Bottom line I think it's a celebration of motherhood but it's not sugarcoated it's really warts and all. Congratulations Mr Bong!".

	onyx:emotionText "Bong manages to capture some of the poignancy of motherhood in his film Mother which concerns an elderly single mother played by Hyeja Kim and her son Yoon Dojoon played by Bin Won. Dojoon is mentally disabled he has a low intelligence and seems to have problems with his memory. His mother is absolutely devoted to her son. Bong throws light on that extraordinary capacity of some women to totally subjugate their own lives to those of their children who live for the pep that they get seeing often unappreciative family members troughing their way through their latest offering.Dojoon is framed up fairly early on by the police for a murder that they can't really be bothered to investigate thoroughly. So mum is on the case you'd better believe it! This involves for example bringing in drinks for all the members of the detective bureau on a visit to the precinct. There's a lot of tragedy in the movie but it's offset by a comedy that is at times is almost outrageous in it's manipulativeness Bong's really being directly provocative at times though not in a salacious sense! There's a grand surreal scene at one point where he convinces you that a very minor character is going to perform a deeply uncanny suicide and then something totally banal happens instead. One of my favourite scenes is a scene on a golf course where a shot dollys across to some action taking place in sugarwhite bunkers which would not be out of place in a Fellini movie.Bong was playing with my emotions throughout he set up affiliations between me and other characters only to subvert them or rebuild them later he builds scenes to emotional explosiveness just for the sake of it. The film leaves you emotionally confused at times Bong's smashing all the buttons on the telephone and so you don't really know what number is being dialled. The effect is deliberate.Bottom line I think it's a celebration of motherhood but it's not sugarcoated it's really warts and all. Congratulations Mr Bong!";

	schema:reviewBody "After a night of drinking Do Joon Bin Won an intellectuallychallenged young man encouraged by his reckless buddy Jintae Kujin attempts to pick up a young high school girl Ahjung walking home alone. Shockingly the next day Do Joon is arrested for the girl's murder as his mother looks on helplessly. Seen at the Vancouver Film Festival Bong Joonho's Mother is an intelligent suspenseful and darkly comic revelation of the lengths to which an overbearing but deeply loving mother will go to pursue justice for her son who she believes has been wrongly convicted of murder.Though there is an evocative score by Lee Byeongwoo the film's use of ambient sounds such as the slashing of Hyeja's herb chopper and the rustling of leaves add to an ominous mood though it often clashes with the absurdist events seen on screen. Set in a small Korean town the elderly mother played by Korean TV star Kim Hyeja in one of the most nuanced and emotive performances of the year makes a living by selling herbal medicine and providing illegal acupuncture treatments. Convinced of her son's innocence she will stop at nothing even violence to find the real killer. She learns details about the dead girl's personal life and talks to alternative suspects even though even she is not fully prepared for the twists and turns that her investigation will take.The film opens with a shot of a lone elderly woman walking in a vast expanse of open field reminiscent of the opening shot in Shunji Iwai's All About Lily Chou Chou. As she approaches the camera the background music becomes rhythmic and the woman begins a strange almost provocative dance. The scene then shifts to her business where she is keeping a close eye on her 27yearold son DoJoon who she feels needs her constant protection. Playing in the street with a dog the boy is knocked over by a speeding hit and run driver in a MercedesBenz.Uninjured DoJoon and Jintae chase the car to a golf course where the two attack the drivers of the Benz with sticks while collecting numerous golf balls later to be used in evidence in court. On the fateful night after DoJoon is thrown out of a bar for being drunk he pursues AhJung home and the next day is arrested for murder although details of what happened are murky. Bong shows the police procedural as in Memories of Murder to be on the lackadaisical side and conveys the impression that everyone involved is only out for their selfinterest including police lawyers friends junk dealers and schoolgirls.Reminiscent of the quirky offbeat films of Alfred Hitchcock Mother is an intense witty and engaging psychological thriller with enigmatic characters that do not just populate the screen but are vitally alive. In one outstanding scene that will etch itself forever in your memory Hyeja attends the funeral of the girl her son is alleged to have murdered. Although besieged by distraught family members who think her son is a murderer she has the fortitude to look them in the eye and proclaim my son could never do something like that. Although barking dogs don't bite this woman is one mutha of an exception.".

Both films dig deep into the hollow lives of these characters bereft of love and even the most elemental human contact and affection in their lives. And both films point out the sheer perversity of the modern human spirit searching for this love we all dare to desire. Nothing is missing from this absolutely brilliant tour de force of human rendering that will leave you in disgust and awe. After all what are movies for?

	schema:headline " An extraloyal mom";
	schema:reviewBody "Bong Joonho's new film is built around actors. The starting point of it is Kim Hyeja 'grande dame' of Korean acting around whom the screenplay by Bong and Park Eunkyo is built who gets a chance to break away from the longsuffering boundlessly loving mother image she maintains in the longrunning Rustic Diary TV series to embrace a juicier darker richer role. Likewise Won Bin whose prettyboy looks have gotten him gangster and perfect son casting here becomes the slackjawed unpredictable Dojoon a retard not taken seriously by most of the town but zealously protected by his apothecary mom Kim who even sleeps in the same bed with him though he's 27. Both the mother's and son's roles are challenging. Kim Hyeja shows an incredible emotional range within a deglamorized exterior and Won Bin subtly sidesteps dumbguy shtick managing to keep Dojoon lastingly unpredictable and mysterious.Dojoon has a runin with the police after he and his friend Jintae Jin Gu hassle some fat cats at the golf club after one of them hits Dojoon with his Mercedes and doesn't stop. Simple Dojoon brags about being at the police station but then gets drunk brooding about the way Jintae ribs him for being a virgin and wanting to get laid. Then that same night Ahjong a schoolgirl is found with her head bashed in and Dojoon becomes the prime suspect. His case seems hopeless but his aging mother convinced that Dojoon would never hurt a fly takes it upon herself to conduct her own investigation of the case which neither the cops nor the fancy lawyer she has engaged are interested in. This story carries its motherson relationship well beyond the usual. There is no extent to which this mom won't go to protect and exonerate her son and some of the memories that are dredged up are troubling indeed.In some aspects 'Mother' reaches back to Bong's 2003 '80'sset police procedural 'Memories of Murder' particularly to its sensitive development of a smalltown milieu. But this film is also full of comic aspects like the director's later international success 'The Host' 2006 also a NYFf selection. The focus on mysterious isolated people relates to the main character in Bong's topdrawer segment of the 2008 'Tokyo!' trilogy Shaking Tokyo. Cell phone cameras autographed golf balls and acupuncture also play key roles in the story which is full of interesting twists and turns. A major turnaround comes from Dojoon's badboy friend Jintae whose true role we have no idea of at first.Bong explodes the image of the ideal mother and as usual bends genres in this new effort. At times this might seem a twisted psychological thriller with links to Douglas Sirk and Sam Fuller and the occasionally oldfashioned movie music by Lee Byeongwoo traditionally surging at key points reinforces that impression. Ryu Seonghie the production designer has worked extensively with Park Chanwook and d.p. Hong Gyeongpyo does a superb job in integrating the looks of a wide variety of locations. This is highly sophisticated Korean cinema at its technical best.We can't possibly reveal the outcome the essence of 'Mother' is that its plot is packed with surprises. Perhaps indeed there are a few too many the last ten minutes introduce further twists after the surprise climax that might better have been omitted. For all the great look terrific acting and explosive plot twists I'm not sure this is up to the best of Bong Joonho's previous work. It's fun and entertaining especially at the outset and watchable throughout but Bong and Park's screenplay meanders a bit. The film's inclusion in the 2009 New York Film Festival may owe more to timing to the bloom that's still upon Korean cinema and to Bong's status as an alumnus of the festival than to the film's intrinsic merit. Hong Sangsoo a NYFF favorite despite a new film that's received raves is omitted this year. His 2008 NYFF Parisbased entry was somewhat lackluster. . .Bong's 'Mother''Madeo' was included in the Un Certain Regard series at Cannes and shown as part of the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center 2009.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're familiar with Bong Joonho's works then Mother comes without surprise at how he deftly weaves a story about mother's love into a mystery thriller that will keep you guessing every step of the way with enough emotional firepower to twist a knot in your stomach when the truth gets played out. It's a standard three act structure here where the first hour establishes the strong family bonds between Mother Kim HyeJa and child Yoon DoJoon Won Bin bordering quite close to being incestuous but this is glossed over since we're dealing with a manchild here before they key murder scene beocmes the catalyst for Mother to do some serious investigations work in order to prove her son's innocence given that the perverted justice system provided that bad aftertaste.I particularly enjoyed the epilogue which ties in with the inexplicable opening credits which made more sense once you've come full circle at the end. It's the classic mantra of two wrongs never making one right and how in the protection of loved ones one will resort to extreme measures that blind common good sense and become a rather you than me syndrome which I believe every one of us are capable of if we find ourselves pushed to a corner with no where to run. Bong JoonHo is again at his element in unravelling the investigations process which ties in black comedy with painful dramatic moments being evenly paced with heightened tension at appropriate moments.And kudos of course must go to actress Kim HyeJa who almost singlehandedly carried the film on her own since Won Bin disappears midway through. Her single mom with so much affection for her son just dazzles and makes it convincing that she's been that single pillar of strength and shelter for her son when he gets up to shenanigans brought about by no good company of his. It's not the first time DoJoon got himself into a fix given the strange mannerisms he's been taught to try and jog his memory and Won Bin showcases his acting chops as the dimwitted boy whose disability gets frequently exploited coming off as endearing at times so much so that you're quick to judge and side with him as a victim of circumstances being at the wrong place at the wrong time.Mother is definitely recommended stuff especially if you're a Bong JoonHo fan as he delivers yet another powerful film that will leave plenty of postscreening discussion.".

This is a movie that keeps you watching throughout despite the slow pacing and lack of action.The character development is excellent fully natural low key throughout and thoroughly involving. Unsurprisingly the actors selected to pay the various characters are just right for the part particularly Hyeja Kim who we only ever know as 'mother'. She's a unique choice of lead and fits the role perfectly. Won Bin who made an excellent action hero in THE MAN FROM NOWHERE is equally excellent here as the slowwitted son and he really gets his teeth into the part.MOTHER may be a slow burner of a film but it has a subtle way of truly involving the viewer in the storyline. The tension builds as the climax nears and then the movie hits you with some moments of quiet devastation that prove a shock to the core. Fans expecting another pulsepounding thriller like THE YELLOW SEA may be disappointed but those with open minds will have a ball.".

But this film is different completely the opposite of what one would expect similar to that of the ending of Memories of Murder. It's not simply about finding out what really happened in the crime scene but rather a shocking twist to how people can change as a result of the crime.

	schema:reviewBody "ALERT SPOILERS AHEAD! This is a poorly scripted Korean mystery thriller that seems to have impressed everyone else posting here the only naysayer before me was only complaining that it wasn't up to the genius previous work of Bong.I'm certain that knowitall IMDbers will reject my POV but here's some key points that need to be raised by a nonsycophant. A good let alone great thriller needs careful scripting  direction to maintain the audience's state of suspending disbelief this is a key element of greater importance than say in the case of a slice of life kitchen sink film or a drawing room comedy where very little out of the ordinary occurs.By having unbelievable coincidences as key features to the story's progress Bong lost me completely. I will focus on a central series of scenes where all narrative believability falls apart. The schoolgirl is showing Mother how she adapts a cell phone for spy use as they sit in a cafe. Outside the window two boys obviously spot her. When Mother's inquisitiveness raises suspicion the girl sends her out to the drugstore to buy emergency tampons ! as an excuse to make a hasty exit. As expected the girl is gone when the Mother returns yet she immediately and oh so conveniently finds the girl nearby being tortured in an alley by the rather guiltyseeming two boys only to be miraculously saved by a brutish adult who is angered by their despoiling his space in the alley territorial imperative. Soon after Mother is presenting her son's untrustworthy but helpful best friend with a vast wad of cash. He had previously requested she use his text message to get the money settlement directly into his bank account she has another wad of money she doesn't give him BOTH sums of money are impossible to explain in her possession since she's destitute and director Bong presumably with scenes deleted for eventual DVD bonus use never makes even a token effort to establish the money's existence as credible. With the money in hand her son's friend gruesomely for gorehounds' enjoyment Bong having a horror movie following already from prior work tortures one of the boys for information. All of this is nonsensical storytelling utter garbage incompetently written structured and directed. I daresay if this film were not on a pedestal as a subtitled foreign import but merely a U.S. Bmovie this reject scripting would be ridiculed by the same clowns including brain dead critics and film festival program directors who praise MOTHER.Late in the film after searching the site for perhaps 8 seconds Mother's son finds the incriminating acupuncture box which he presents to her in a reveal near the end of the film. This is ludicrous scripting the director DOES NOT play fair with the audience the first time around in letting us perhaps see or through sleight of hand misdirection not realize we are observing the boy finding the case. A hack director could show the boy idly picking something up but through his mise en scene not show us what it is that's how you set up the later revelation properly. It is highly improbable that the admittedly incompetent authorities much of this nonsensical film is built on the premise that the local police are the most dimwitted on the planet and incapable of acquiring or processing evidence would have not noticed the case with infinitely more time to observe the fire scene than our hero and the state of conflagration of the junkman's hut renders the virtually intact not mint condition but nearly VG state of the acupuncture case and its contents as pure hokum.That reminds me of the biggest cheat which make comparisons of this junker with any classic or just classy mystery film of yore let alone Hitchcock ludicrous being the presentation of the girl's murder in the first place. It is a total audience fakeout we see our hero suspiciously pursuing the young schoolgirl around corner after corner see her disappear in a side way the heavy rock is thrown out at his feet but the editing offers no hint or fairness in terms of the later revelation by the junk dealer which we have no reason to doubt since we the audience AREN'T the hero's Mother but supposedly objective observers that the schoolgirl had a key conversation with the hero at this point leading to him assaulting her. I object to the omission of ALL this key material of course the director shouldn't show us the murder early on but the premurder material must be presented in a fairer way to be taken seriously. Remember Hitchcock's emphasis on suspense Bong is all about surprise with most of the violent scenes and other morbid buildups taken right out of the horror play book shock cinema. Destined for a contemporary audience that unlike its ancestors film buffs who used to care about credibility will uncritically swallow anything believe anything and forgive anything dished out by today's crop of hack ultrahack and megahack directors.".

It is highly improbable that the admittedly incompetent authorities much of this nonsensical film is built on the premise that the local police are the most dimwitted on the planet and incapable of acquiring or processing evidence would have not noticed the case with infinitely more time to observe the fire scene than our hero and the state of conflagration of the junkman's hut renders the virtually intact not mint condition but nearly VG state of the acupuncture case and its contents as pure hokum.That reminds me of the biggest cheat which make comparisons of this junker with any classic or just classy mystery film of yore let alone Hitchcock ludicrous being the presentation of the girl's murder in the first place. It is a total audience fakeout we see our hero suspiciously pursuing the young schoolgirl around corner after corner see her disappear in a side way the heavy rock is thrown out at his feet but the editing offers no hint or fairness in terms of the later revelation by the junk dealer which we have no reason to doubt since we the audience AREN'T the hero's Mother but supposedly objective observers that the schoolgirl had a key conversation with the hero at this point leading to him assaulting her. I object to the omission of ALL this key material of course the director shouldn't show us the murder early on but the premurder material must be presented in a fairer way to be taken seriously. Remember Hitchcock's emphasis on suspense Bong is all about surprise with most of the violent scenes and other morbid buildups taken right out of the horror play book shock cinema. Destined for a contemporary audience that unlike its ancestors film buffs who used to care about credibility will uncritically swallow anything believe anything and forgive anything dished out by today's crop of hack ultrahack and megahack directors.";

	schema:headline " One of the BEST foreign thrillers ever!";
	schema:reviewBody "She'll stop at nothing reads the ominous tagline on the poster of Bong Joonho's latest cinematic triumph Mother. I remember seeing Bong's thriller The Host the one filmed documentarystyle where a giant octopus threatens a city and I didn't think much of him as a director sure the movie was interesting and thrilling enough but it didn't make it great or memorable. One year afterwards he turns up with Mother and quickly establishes himself among the greatest and most respected of foreign directors. I mean how can I sufficiently give honor and credit to such an intelligent film? In one year Bong has managed to mature cinematically and challenge audiences worldwide with a film that's deep VERY thrilling intelligent to a tee and indubitably important.The film's short title and its ominous tagline tells us a bit about the plot obviously it's about a mother who'll stop at nothing. Duh. The mother in the film is nameless perhaps so we can identify with her and her unending quest. Played to perfection by Kim Hyeja she's an overprotective extremely affectionate woman who sells a variety of herbs and medicinal plants and who performs acupuncture to her rich customers on a South Korean city of no name. Her son Dojoon Won Bin is one step away from retarded mildmannered and allaround silly we fail to identify with him at the beginning and go as far as to condemn his passiveness. In his stupidity he hangs around with a local tough guy named Jintae who's his best friend and who accompanies him to the local country club to collect stray golf balls whom Dojoon plans to offer as a gift to a girl he likes. From the beginning scenes where a car runs over Dojoon and Jintae goads him into wrecking the culprit's car on revenge we know their friendship is flawed and the latter can do nothing but lead the poor retard on a wrong path.Well it so happens that one night Dojoon gets drunk and as he goes back home to his worrying mother he follows a girl down a seedy path looking to have sex with her. She ignores him and he returns home as planned...but on the following morning the girl is found dead on a rooftop and one of Dojoon's golf balls is found near the scene of the crime. The police guesses he's guilty they present him with a document where he pleads guilty which the silly Dojoon signs in his navet. Having accepted the guilt for the crime he's imprisoned much to the rage of his affable mother. She knows him better than anyone and is SURE he's not guilty but the police won't hear otherwise and she has no money to entice a lawyer into thoroughly investigating the case. So like any concerned mother she starts playing detective around town trying to solve the mystery behind the girl's death so she can acquit her son. But as truth after disturbing truth is uncovered our protagonist finds that 'she'll stop at nothing' to save her son's freedom.The film shines. The many technical aspects such as the muted ominous score the perfect editing and the cinematography aid in making this an interesting experience but the REAL triumph behind the movie is a the clever screenplay and b Kim Hyeja's flawless acting. First the plot thickens and thickens to insurmountable depths and it leaves virtually no plotholes it's a welldevised mystery unlike any I've recently seen. And second Kim's performance of a cunning methodical calculating mother truly deserves an Oscar nod. Every second she's on screen she turns up the thrills. We can't help rooting for this enraged mother trying to protect her son even as the mystery leads her deeper into a web of violence and murder and the depth she gives to her character alone make the goingson all the more nerveshattering.I can't say more about the plot because I might give away some spoilers but trust me when I say every single scene every single character counts and Bong Joonho has gone meticulously through the film to present us one of the most exciting thrillers ever. John Powers from Vogue calls it darkly funny and I have to agree. Even though it is a detective thriller it's enriched with some VERY dark comedy seasoned with cinematic irony and social commentary that will have you meditating on the absurd nature of crime scene investigations. Not only does the movie present you with a swell story but it touches on themes such as crime prostitution nosecrets towns the stupidity of our youngsters and most importantly the zealous nature of mothers towards their sons. Few films manage to exact surprised laughs from us at the same time that it keeps us riveted to the edge of our seats our minds shattered by what we see.I recently discovered this was South Korea's official entry for the 82nd Academy Awards last year 2009 and I am enraged to see it wasn't nominated in the end. A film of such power and such depth shouldn't be overlooked and quite frankly I'm appalled to see films like Mother be snubbed from the Oscars even Italy's excellent film Vincere was snubbed and overlooked for other films like Peru's La Teta Asustada which even though it was very interesting doesn't reach Mother or Vincere's height. Mother is a film every thrillerlover should watch and I can assure you it won't be easily forgotten.Rating 4 stars out of 4!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I had doubts about this movie early on it started slowly and felt like a wandering indie drama. So I looked at a few reviews to see if I should keep watching and found all these raves saying it was Hitchockian and full of twists and turns. So I thought well it must get more interesting. And yes if you slog through the first hour it does get more interesting. The story picks up and in the last half hour there are a couple of moderately surprising twists and some genuine intensity.But comparing this to Hitchcock is just weird. Yes the score has a bit of Hitchcock in it but the movie is nothing Hitchcock would do it's more of a wandering mother drama tied around a murder case rather than a suspense movie. I know the director has made genre movies in the past but I think if a different director not known for such films were to put this same movie out it wouldn't even be described as a suspense film.The movie also has one twist that is completely unreasonable. A similar twist was used years ago in a mystery book and it was castigated as unfair yet it was far more fair than the way it was done in this movie. It's not really a twist at all. A twist is when you are lead to believe one thing and then you get a new perspective that makes you see it differently. This was just a cinematic lie and not remotely clever.The movie is watchable and because it gets progressively better as it goes along I have a more favorable impression of it than if I'd given up during the tedious first half. If you could edit the first hour of this movie into about fifteen minutes you would have something short but pretty entertaining but still unfair. Overall this was just a waste of my time.".

Maybe it has to do with the mother who remains elusive at all times even if the title already gives away how as to we should look at her and that it simply indicates who the main character is  should be.The other points of view through the son's eyes and several other supporting ones and the fact that the story plays with the facts of a gruesome murder case demand a lot of attention as well which takes away some of the focus on the most important character mom.These are just some ideas that I have about why I feel that this is my least favorite Joon Ho Bong movie but it may very well be a more intuitive thing for me also. The movie and story simply didn't grab me as much as especially 'Gwoemul' and 'Memories and murder' did. It felt dragged out too long and was too depressing maybe even for me.A good 6 out of 10 it deserves nonetheless at the least fine acting cinematography. And maybe I'll try it again some day.".

How do you open us up? This one's a great example but you'll have to wait for the last scene. A few things are first established before the crucial crime. A hit and run introduces random agency in a world where violence can swoop down from nowhere and wreck lives. The altercation with the broken car mirror is for us to understand that the savant boy is an unreliable narrator susceptible to stories. And his relationship with the mother is portrayed to teeter between the merely awkward and the unacceptable so that we first have to struggle with our own selves before we can empathize with either.And then it becomes about us. How we are susceptible to stories unreliable narrators of what we witness. How empathy is a matter of inheriting a story as though it was our own child in it going on faith. Do we believe the guileless boy as his mother does? Do we trust that he remembers when he does? Our own visual testimony? It is about us having to struggle to empathize. About us having empathized being uncertain of the judgement. This is a hard earned empathy not Spielberg's mushy one where cute lost boys face obvious evil evil here being the inability to even know about it.  it's really vital to realize that the boy's original impression of the crucial scene is his own 'real' subsequent memory of it the event having been reconfigured into view in just the way we first see it. It confuses because that is what he recalls having happened he's not lying.  the important discovery of the victim's cell phone leads to a story that trickles to the mother through three levels of narrators the victim inside a stoned boy's memory being told to a third person. The phone itself is full of pictures of men each one potentially the culprit.  later in the film there is a reconstruction of the original scene of the murder as the savant finally remembers a man in the house and this man is later found and gives his own testimony. This is so good it's worthy of the photo reconstruction scene in Bladerunner.  this recalling is marvelously framed through windows and unclean glass. At its most pure the film is this glimpse through hazy glass at a troubled boy trying to remember it's about moving walls around to create that space where something horrible happened.  the film begins with an image of the mother at that point simply she's just a middleaged woman to us inexplicably dancing in a field. In the end we know at what point in the story this takes place but the gesture remains wonderfully ambiguous. Which brings me to the last scene. The whole film is meant to appeal to a broad audience though it presents by no means simple and uncomplicated truths. But the last scene is one of the most striking I have seen. Great cinema begins where drama and metaphor end it's hard to describe what that next step is in short we'd say transcendent. The context of narrative is always illusory it is the opportunity for us to be aware in a certain sense. This is why it doesn't matter what's the answer to the mystery in Blowup or why the hayloft barn ablaze in Zerkalo is not encountered as the result of any logical causation.In the last scene we have that step beyond causation into ambiguous air. The mother has been sent off in a bus with other middleaged people. She prickles her knee with her acupuncturist's needle hitting that spot that eases the heart. See what happens in the film. What is the urge that lifts everyone from their seat? There's a lot of great Asian cinema I'm being exposed to lately and that scene is the third most captivating in an Asian film of the decade I've seen all three involving physical activity of some sort as transcendence two of them dancing.

It's director Joonho Bong's unique style of old and modern approaches to filmmaking  his stylistic and subtle ability to weave this story and employing a witty use of dark humor throughout is what makes this film so impressive. Mother slowly burns its way towards revelations and depths of a character's soul that most dramatic thrillers shy away from. The most surprising aspect of Mother is how differently it begins and from that what it becomes. Unique and utterly compelling in its entirety Mother concludes in a manner that solves all or nearly all outstanding riddles. Mother deftly weaves a story about mother's love into a mystery thriller that will keep you guessing every step of the way.".

It's director Joonho Bong's unique style of old and modern approaches to filmmaking  his stylistic and subtle ability to weave this story and employing a witty use of dark humor throughout is what makes this film so impressive. Mother slowly burns its way towards revelations and depths of a character's soul that most dramatic thrillers shy away from. The most surprising aspect of Mother is how differently it begins and from that what it becomes. Unique and utterly compelling in its entirety Mother concludes in a manner that solves all or nearly all outstanding riddles. Mother deftly weaves a story about mother's love into a mystery thriller that will keep you guessing every step of the way.";

Many a cop movieseries has been devoted to such scenarios movies like Micheal Mann's 'Heat' or 'Leathal Weapon' spring to mind. Yet what raises this movie above the average cop thriller is the frightening way Asian cinema is able to change the mood of a movie from one frame to another.This is now a hall mark of Asian cinema and is rooted in a tradition whereby genres such as comedy horror romance and thrillers can be mixed all together in one movie take Japanese Kitano or Hong Kong John Woo cinema as examples. For the last fifteen years Asian cinema has been producing genre defying movies. Korea has now entered into the fray and are producing movies where suspense romance and terror can be weaved into a narrative and still retain a sense of realism. This is what Hollywood is failing to achieve with too many Hollywood movies reliant on staple genres and archetype heroes.After a brief respite Asia is once again paving a way for modern cinema to develop and surprisingly Korea seems to be the next port of call for the attention of the movie loving west.A difficult movie to watch but one that is worthy of your attention.".

In the first part of the film the plot is rather common a murder investigation a policeman's family life nothing spectacular. But as the plot evolves it gets more intense. The policeman's life is duplicitous oscillating between the amenable newly pregnant wife and a very appealing mistress the singer Gayee. From the time Gayee finds out she is pregnant too everything gets really complicated. She is confronted with Kihoon's incapacity to commitment regarding the unborn child and her love for him develops into obsession. In the same time during the murder investigation Kihoon experiments some sort of physical attraction to the the former wife of the dead man principal suspect. In a very twisted chance of fate Kihoon and Gayee end up locked in the trunk of his car in an isolated place. The scenes are quite shocking picturing the raw despair and the dramatic moments are so intense that you almost believe they are real. The paroxysm is reached when Gayee has a spontaneous abortion and then begs Kihoon to shoot her which he does. It is worth mentioning that these scenes are very cruel and bloody. The title of the film comes up by Gayee's confession that the name she wanted for the baby is Pearl Hester Pryne's daughter in the novel The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. I was very impressed of the ending in my honest opinion the actors played excellent some of most complex and hard to imitate human feelings. If I should compare this film to other it would be with Irreversible.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was very surprised at the quality of this film. Script direction and performances were superb. It is a gritty often violent romance between two young men of different classes and the love that almost destroys them.SuMin is an 18 year old orphan who comes to the city of Seoul Korea to find work so that he can put himself through college and gain an education. He works at a variety of jobs one of which is a car service. Here he meets the tortured JaeMin Song a wealthy closeted young man who is trapped by his parents into a soon to be heterosexual wedding.JaeMin falls hard for SuMin who rejects him because of his contempt for the rich and careless. When SuMin loses his jobs he turns to a life of prostitution in an allmale brothel where JaeMin tracks him down as a client only further gaining SuMin's contempt.It is JaeMin's true love and constant pursuit of SuMin that finally wins him over. The jaded SuMin allows himself to return the love but the road to happiness is paved with many pitfalls all arising out of the class hatred and opposite backgrounds of the two protagonists.The film's first half occurs almost always at night in murky and oftentimes unpleasant locations. When love blossoms it is all sunlight playing over naked bodies. Then night falls once again.The script is very believable in depicting the conflicts of the main characters although it has some plot continuity problems at times. The subtitles are poorly written and spelled but one can grasp what is happening at all times.Both Lee Younghoon as SuMin and Kim Namgil as JaeMin turn in extraordinary emotional performances  every nuance from elation to grief is superbly expressed. Directorwriter Leesong Heeil in his first feature has the firm control over every detail of a veteran film director and does an astonishing job here.This is the best gaythemed film to come out of Asia and the Pacific Islands thus far and is close to masterpiece status. One of the great film experiences for gay audiences.".

	schema:reviewBody "NO REGRET HUHWIHAJI ANHA is an impressive film from Korea especially in that it is the first venture for writerdirector Heeil Leesong who gives evidence of not only a his ability to create a film that examines life in Korea in a verismo style but also knows how to cast and direct a crew of actors in a polished manner. He is most assuredly a new artist to watch. NO REGRET takes many chances with the story of Korean orphans growing to the age of self sufficiency without the guidance of parents fending out a life with the sole support of their fellow orphans. The boys in this story come from the country with little exposure to the city life of Seoul and the tough choices that must be made to survive. The other side of the story reflects the wealthy young men who come from homes burdened with high expectations and preordained 'lives' of inheriting the family business marrying the right girl continuing the level of 'sophistication' to which they were born. NO REGRET places a member of each of these disparate groups together and the impact of opposite backgrounds is the thread that weaves so well through this love story. Lee Sumin the remarkably gifted newcomer Younghoon Lee is the orphan who works at menial jobs until he finds a source of good money as a rent boy in a company called XLarge. Sumin adapts well as he is apparently comfortable with his sexuality his fellow exorphans who work at XLarge present the gamut of types that find prostitution monetarily if not emotionally rewarding. At a chance encounter SuMin meets Song Jaemin Namgil Kim and while the attraction is one sided at first Jaemin is bound by family expectations to marry and take over the family business and has not come to grips with his sexuality. Fear and recognition of class differences keeps Sumin from responding to the near stalking Jae min but eventually the attraction blossoms and differences seem to disappear. The two young men have found love but Jaemin must cope with the expectations of his family  the results being devastating to both men in different ways. How the relationship works through this rocky road is the essence of the film and to discuss the ending would be to destroy the impact of the film. Every aspect of this film  writing directing acting lighting music editing  is first rate. No one who sees this film will be able to escape the impact of the characterization by Young hoon Lee his screen presence is magnetic and his range of acting is solid. He definitely is a rising star. As for writerdirector Heeil Leesong here is a man who not only knows the art of story telling but also the sensitive insight as to the parameters of both economy and exposition when each element of the story calls. Highly recommended. Grady Harp".

Sung min became a gay prostitute and he changed from innocent sillylook guy became a masculine with good style of clothes. The CEO's son however wooed him even though sung min always rejected him soon after they became a couple but life never that easy since the CEO's son had a fianc and he had to choose between sung min and his family's fortune with condition to marry his fianc. It is a happy ending gay movie even though the ending a bit blur and should be make longer.The feeling of the actors especially the actor who was acted as a sung min is truly incredible he could showed his emotion for the first time knowing what love and happiness is and also showed the anger and sadness of being left behind and being hurt by the person he loved at the 1st time. Not to mention I have to say that the director's job is splendid everything went well and touched my emotion still the movie is quite dark they should make it lighter for the light since I barely see anything when they were acted in the dark room. The sex scene is really good and full of emotion and I suppose it is not been easy for the actors to do it. This is the 1st movie that could really show a good gay sex scene differ with France Japan Chinese Thailand gay movies.".

To get the full effect of this movie or any subtitled movie it is worth watching twice to capture anything that you miss. You won't be disappointed in watching this!";

We have this jerk so messed up so wandering so selfish aimless and unlikable that it was extremely hard to get past the attraction a highly favored businessman's upandcoming son Jaemin unless it was just that physical attraction. He claims otherwise that it's love. But after watching this it's like loving Charles Manson because you dig the beard. Alright he's not that bad but still no real redeemable characteristics. I could never get past the reason Jaemin endless stalks Sumin. It was never shown just told that Jaemin loves Sumin. Perhaps it's a culture thing that flew over my head crazystalking  mad love over in Seoul. It has to be because a little more than half the movie is one stalking the other and the last part is stalking back and forth to the point I thought this was turning into a screwball comedy. I was waiting for a tiger named baby to make an appearance. Okay so Sumin works two jobs while going to school so far so good on someone trying to better themselves. But after his first taste of his stalker's attraction he gives up his day job for some kind of prostitution ring. What? OK well as previously mentioned the obsession doesn't stop due to the jobcareer change and if you throw in a bunch of other very angry characters you get one messed up movie where unbelievable occurrences just seem to happen without buildup. Basic movie not 100 terrible but you can do better with foreign gaythemed movies.".

To say that Mr. Vengeance is a powerful gutwrenching nightmare is like saying that DaVinci merely dabbled in art.The plot is so simple yet so complex. The direction is so elegant yet so hardhitting. The simplistic nature of the story makes the descent into hell so shocking and captivating. You don't realize there is no going back until it's far FAR too late.Ryu is a deafmute who works in the loudest factory in the world doing a really depressing job. His sister needs a kidney transplant but they don't have the money to pay for it. He cannot give her one of his own because their blood types do not match. Ryu decides to go to black market organ traders to trade one of his own for one that matches his sister. Waking up naked and kidneyless in an abandoned building he now needs to raise money for his own kidney.Ryu is now fired from his job by President Park who is downsizing the company. His anarchist girlfriend Yeongmi convinces him to kidnap Park's daughter and hold her to ransom. From then on things get very very VERY heavy and the idea of who exactly Mr. Vengeance is is blurred and sympathy is felt for almost everyone. Revenge comes at a high price and seemingly never ends. Not that I am saying forgiving and forgetting is the way. But this movie will make you think twice about getting your own back.The violence is spontaneous and extremely graphic without ever feeling exploitational. Sometimes it has a darkly comic feel to it the rest of the time it's goddamn hardcore. You'll wince a great deal during this movie that's for damn sure.Park Chanwook directs with such beautifully composed images that are far from the the garish MTVstyle actionthriller movies produced in Hollywood these days. I don't want to sound like some sort of snob who proclaims all foreign films to be great and all Hollywood to be crap but it's not very often that Hollywood makes a film like this unless it's a remake. Written in a mere 20 hours in a single massive creative outburst this movie seems to have genius laced through every minute of it's running time.Not a date movie not a whogivesadamn pigout movie. Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance is a film you will be sucked right into and you'll be far from happy when you emerge at the end. But what a horrific ride!".

This is a stunning piece of work which wipes the floor with contemporary Hollywood's socalled thrillers. It's a very grim and depressing movie full of violence but also includes some great performances some beautiful sequences and characters you genuinely empathize with. Sadly very few people are going to see this brilliant movie and the few who get to hear about it will be told about the more extreme and brutal scenes and will probably think it's just about shock for shocks sake. It's anything but.

Hakyun Shin plays Ryu an unemployed deaf mute who is desperate to help his sick sister JiEun Lim who needs a kidney transplant. When his experiences on the organ black market fail the movie deals with this and I don't want to spoil it his politically extreme girlfriend Yusun Bobae Han hatches a kidnap plan. This sets off a tragic chain of events that you just have to see to believe! I was immediately fascinated with the movie and my interest never let up for a minute. The actors are all first rate and Park's direction is difficult to fault. The movie continually surprises all the way up to its very compelling climax.

	schema:reviewBody "I've been reading over user comments on Sympathy and I'm pretty shocked. What gore fest were you people watching? I remember only a couple of really gory moments but there was nothing that was too extreme save for Ryu's murderous assault towards the end and the very very brief torture scene. If you have weak stomachs don't watch movies with any bit of gore in them. You're the wrong kind of people to be reviewing this kind of film. As a critic you should be able to put personal biases aside and give a fair and balanced review of the movie in question but you've let a little bit of violence offend you. And that's not a bad thing it's just that letting biases get in the way can really ruin a review.Violence in cinema isn't a terrible thing. When there's blood on the screen and people write off the film as tripe automatically it bothers me to no end. It's blood. So what? When the movie turns into something that only progresses to get to another gory violent scene that's a problem and if you felt that way about Sympathy I feel for you and I apologize. That said I definitely did not see it as being something that sought to continue just to display more brutality. The scenes in question were meant to create tension and drama and in some ways show progression of character. They were not meant to be there simply because blood  good and again I do feel badly for anybody who took it that way because that really isn't any fun.What was fun for me at least was the whole of this film. I tend to be wary whenever different abled people are cast in lead roles in films although you'll never hear me use that term in a serious tone.  I must admit having the lead be deaf made me nervous as I've seen some pretty bad films and television programs featuring deaf characters. In my junior year in high school I learned ASL and I furthered the experience for years beyond that. Whenever I see any character be they deaf blind mute crippled etc portrayed in any film I pray that the filmmakers get it right and not make a stereotype and a mockery of the character.In the case of Sympathy Ryu was excellent. His signing though not the American Sign Language that I'm familiar with it's Korea for crying out loud was spoton from the way he physically articulated the signs to his facial expressions per sign. Shin HaKyun plays Ryu perfectly in fact he's so good that I am tempted to say that he's probably deaf himself. The way that Chanwook Park makes use of his protagonist's deafness also is excellent his cuts from Ryu signing to a black screen with translations of the signs are really great. The personisspeakingbutyouherenothing shots are also wonderful as is the shot of Ryu in the factory wearing nothing to protect his ears while everyone else is. It's these little things that help create the atmosphere and to build on Ryu. Wonderful stuff.Chanwook Park also tends to get very inventive with the camera in other ways as well so much so that I think he's one of the most unique directors around today. I want to see more of his technique thus I am looking forward to seeing Oldboy whenever I have the chance to. He doesn't however go too crazy with things which I appreciate since a lot of directors try to be inventive and ultimately give you annoying camera work that seems more like that of an amateur than that of an auteur.The story follows a deaf man Ryu who gives all of his saved money to thugs in order to get a kidney transplant for his sister he was going to use it to just have a legal transfer done but nobody matches his sister's blood type. He wakes up to find himself down a kidney down 10000 won and down all of his clothing and he later finds out that the hospital has found a matching donor much to his chagrin. With no other recourse as they see it Ryu and his girlfriend kidnap the daughter of Dongjin Park and hold her for ransom. With cycles of vengeance firmly implanted in the story Chanwook gives us a riveting narrative as Dongjin Park searches desperately for the people who took his child. In the end does everyone get their revenge?Chanwook would have you believe so but he's more interested in generating sympathy for each character as everyone is a victim in their own way even the criminals hence the title Sympathy For Mr.Vengeance. Many people become their own Mr.Vengeance whether it is Ryu kidnapping Dongjin Park's daughter for money as well as for retribution Dongjin fires Ryu from his job early in the film after all or the aching father hunting down the kidnappers one by one. It's one of the the few films I've seen do this and it's something that I appreciate greatly. Not all criminals are motivated by an uncompromising hatred lurking within them so what does motivate them? You'll see.If you're looking for something creative and fresh and you don't mind a few graphic scenes here and there then I would recommend this.  out of ten".

When one acts out of vengeance one seeks only to hurt and when people start hurting each other because they're hurt themselves everybody ends up hurting and nobody really gains anything.I think that's the main message Park ChanWook wants us to take away from SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE though the movie is complex and oblique and doubtless open to many interpretations. It is a challenging movie in many ways  the story is never spelled out clearly leaving the viewer to deduce many key events and motivations. Dialogue is sparse and this is not solely attributable to the fact that the main character is deaf and dumb. The movie also challenges  almost terrorises  with its bleakness and occasional scenes of quite disturbing violence and gore.SFMV is an ambitious project and one that doesn't fit into any established cinematic mould. The story characters themes and aesthetics are all very unusual and creative. I can't think of any other film that's quite like it though at times I likened the experience to that of watching certain Takashi Miike movies. Actually Kim KiDuk's movies are probably the closest point of reference though Park ChanWook's film is smarter.SYMPATHY FOR MR.

Perhaps I'm unfair in my assessment of my friends but I can't think of many that would enjoy it. Actually I'm surprised that the film is held in such wide regard as its not a conventional film or an easy film and is far more art than entertainment. In my experience that narrows a film's audience significantly but I've yet to hear anybody express a negative reaction to the film. I guess originality and technical virtuosity are still appreciated after all  perhaps more so by those that have gravitated to Korean cinema in recent years than in other groups since they are most often to be found there.With JSA and SFMV Park ChanWook has definitely shown himself to be one of the brightest figures in the new wave of Korean directors. Both are very well crafted in pretty much every respect. The cast of SFMV also deserve commendation for their performances which are all good. Song KangHo steals the show with a wonderfully understated performance though.Recommended but make sure you know what you're getting.".

I loved everything about it the acting the story again I had no Idea where it was going I say again because I have mentioned this point in previous reviews Asian films kick ass because they don't pander to focus groups or near sighted Hollywood suits they take you places you either have no Idea where your going or take you places where you may feel the need to turn back but can't.The relationships in this film are so pure so real and beautiful especially between the little girl and her captures. I love the way they set up the scene that would be the catalyst for the ensuing mayhem even until the last second you aren't sure how far they were going to take it. I don't want to ruin anything so I will stop now.I recommend this film to anyone who appreciates a films that break all the rules films that are not easy to digest films that are beautiful and tragic at the same time and guaranteed if you see this film you will feel sympathy for anyone who is put into that postion sympathy on both sides Vengeance is like a pebble in the water.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance is simply put the best film I have seen all year.Chanwook Park's mastery of cinematic language is stunning. I Recently saw Oldboy and was intrigued by the style and freshness of that film. but where Oldboy sometimes degenerates albeit in a very entertaining fashion into simple violence and visceral satisfaction Mr. Vengeance does not.Those not accustomed to a slower paced film may say that there is too much postulation and ambiguity in this film but they would be completely wrong. Never has a film managed to capture my attention so fully as this one. The majority of the time we are left in quiet reflection of the events hat have taken place.

I Recently saw Oldboy and was intrigued by the style and freshness of that film. but where Oldboy sometimes degenerates albeit in a very entertaining fashion into simple violence and visceral satisfaction Mr. Vengeance does not.Those not accustomed to a slower paced film may say that there is too much postulation and ambiguity in this film but they would be completely wrong. Never has a film managed to capture my attention so fully as this one. The majority of the time we are left in quiet reflection of the events hat have taken place.

	schema:reviewBody "Handing out a 10 star rating for a film is not something that should be undertaken lightly. Each rating affects the overall score of the film. People may be persuaded to watch the film or avoid it based upon this score and the comments behind it.A perfect score handed out to the most undeserving of Hollywood trash dramatically lowers the credibility of a rating system and takes away attention from genuinely deserving masterpieces. Sympathy For Mr Vengeance is most certainly one of these masterpieces and deserves every single star there is going.Here's the story.Ryu Hakyun Shin is deaf and mute. His sister is dying. She needs a kidney transplant quickly or she'll die. Ryu an intelligent sort of guy gave up his education to work in a factory which is eerily reminiscent of a vision of Hell itself to pay for his sister's medical expenses. He has very little but he is focused and motivated and never once whines about the myriad misfortunes that plague his life.His girlfriend Yeongmi the extremely cute Duna Bae is a minor league anarchist and activist intent on 'bringing down the corporations'. She is quite the rebel. Her relationship with Ryu began when she was a fellow student at a deaf school from which she was later expelled after it became apparent she was only pretending to be deaf.After conversation with his sister's unhelpful doctor Ryu decides he'll turn to the black market to get his sister a kidney. But his transaction with the organ traffickers ends catastrophically propelling him to get involved in the kidnapping of his boss's young daughter so that the ransom money can save his sister. This kidnapping of course goes tragically wrong and at this point we become ominously aware that all of the heartbreaking things we have seen so far are nothing compared to what's coming.Things quickly spiral downwards into a magnum opus of misery for all concerned. Ryu's boss Park Kangho Song griefstricken and furious haunted and genuinely mystified why anyone would do what Ryu has done is set on an irreversible path of brutal vengeance.Ryu meanwhile has his own tragedy to deal with quite apart from Park's rampage. As things around him disintegrate he is also compelled towards vengeance primarily on the organ traffickers but later in an idea we would see taken to dizzying extremes in Oldboy he decides to take revenge on PARK for taking revenge on HIM.Needless to say none of this ends well for anybody. I've tried very hard to get the themes and ideas of this film across without spoilers but really it wouldn't matter if you knew what was coming. Surprises aren't really important here. You know right from the outset that nobody's getting out alive. What matters here are motives emotions reasons and ultimately extreme and brutal displays of violence.The director Chanwook Park gives a story with no easy answers. In fact it's debatable whether he's asked us any questions. He presents a group of characters in a certain set of circumstances and sets them loose. He never passes judgement over any of his creations leaving the audience to judge for themselves. That's the mark of a masterful director who has faith in and respect for his audience. The actions of his characters take place in a moral vacuum where there is no right or wrong only choices and consequences. There is no divine or poetic justice only revenge.The title of the film relates to perhaps the only real question in the whole film  who do we sympathise with? Do our loyalties lie with Ryu who is motivated only by love for his sister and subject to misfortunes on a massive scale? Or with Park who has always tried to be a fair and honest man only to have his beloved daughter kidnapped and killed albeit accidentally? Both men do deplorable things. Both men become savage murderers. Both men are ultimately the 'Mr Vengeance' of the title. So to whom to we give our sympathy? The acting in this film is of uniformly excellent quality from the main characters to the smallest of walkon parts. Hakyun Shin and Duna Bae learned sign language for this film and give such effortless performances you'd believe they'd been doing it all their lives. Kangho Song's turn as Park is heartbreaking particularly the scene where the camera stays on him and only him as he looks on in horror at his daughter's autopsy complete with sounds of cracking bone and surgical saws.The photography is beautiful showing the beauty and the ugliness of South Korea in equal measures. There is no real soundtrack to speak of only the background sounds of the city and the various locales within it. There's traffic howling wind and trickling water depending on where we are. Perhaps the most surprising thing about this film doubly so if you've read this review to this point is that it's a comedy. A very very black one but still a comedy. Chanwook Park has given us the most tragic of revenge dramas through the filter of humour and that's part of the reason it works so well. Unrelenting misery can only be tolerated for so long. Sooner or later you'll walk away from it unless you can give a wry smile or a genuine bellylaugh now and again. There are many of those here although a few are definite guilty pleasures.To sum up this film is a solid gold masterpiece vastly superior to anything spewed forth by Hollywood these last few decades. The future of cinema is rising in the East.It seems it set in the West a long long time ago.".

Having seen Oldboy I was expecting a much different film. However Chanwook Park pleasantly surprised me with the first part of his revenge trilogy. The plot line is brutal but the visceral appeal of Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance lies in the motives. Nothing is random everything is explained and the viewer can understand why every action is called for. However this is a brutal movie. The action is tough the dialogue minimal with no quick cuts or mindful music. That being said it is never grotesque and the gore never gets to be too much. The visual images in this movie will stay with you for days and the cinematography is flawless. I would recommend this movie for fans of the horror genre looking for an exciting new film and people that do not watch horror movies because they are usually pointless works in gore. Few if any criticisms the lack of music works both for and against the film as I found myself sometimes shifting away from the screen. 9 out of 10 highly recommended but brutal.".

The plot line is brutal but the visceral appeal of Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance lies in the motives. Nothing is random everything is explained and the viewer can understand why every action is called for. However this is a brutal movie. The action is tough the dialogue minimal with no quick cuts or mindful music. That being said it is never grotesque and the gore never gets to be too much. The visual images in this movie will stay with you for days and the cinematography is flawless. I would recommend this movie for fans of the horror genre looking for an exciting new film and people that do not watch horror movies because they are usually pointless works in gore. Few if any criticisms the lack of music works both for and against the film as I found myself sometimes shifting away from the screen. 9 out of 10 highly recommended but brutal.";

I was beginning to despair of seeing some actual violence until the baseball bat scene which i loved  don't get me wrong i'm not a gore nut but the film is quite i don't know....minimalist. The violence is wellorchestrated and used to maximum effect.The ending scene with Ryu and Park in the river is one of those increasingly rare moments of genius  its not spectacular or climactic but it just fits excellently with the mood of the film and says all that needs to be said. Having said that I did feel Park's death was a letdown  not especially bad but story wise just not up to par with the rest of the film though the direction was still spot on.The only oddity i found was the water still being on the floor when the police guy comes round to Park's house....i presumed the scene with his daughter was a dream SCONCLUSIONIn short this is an excellent and very personal film but could benefit from an increased pace  it felt like much longer than the two hours of its running time and partway through I was having doubts about its quality. However the storyline is nicely formed and easy to follow and the characters while not being the most openly emotional still have a roughness which makes them believable.Stunning acting from Hakyun Shin and Kangho Song and if the rumors of Oldboy being even better are true then this director is definitely one to watch.".

Unlike Oldboy I had heard very little concerning Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance but considering the exhaustively emotional experience of watching the newer film I definitely wanted to check out Park's earlier work. I must say that I found this film to be more disturbing than Park's blockbuster. The film opens with a quite touching scene in which a letter sent by the deathmute Ryu is read at a radio station. The letter states how much Ryu appreciates the sacrifices his sister has made for him throughout his life and now because his sister needs a kidney transplant it is time for him to repay her kindness. Sounds like the opening for a great tearjerker but being a Park Chan Wook film things begin to go hideously wrong. Stuff begins to hit the fan when Ryu learns that his blood type is B while his sister's is A so his kidney is useless to her. Not wanting to give up the fight Ryu exchanges his kidney and 10 million Won around ten thousand dollars for a type A kidney. At least this is what he had hoped to do. So penniless and without one of his kidneys Ryu soon learns that a kidney is available for his sister and he only needs to pay the ten million won to make his sister well. Of course Ryu is broke and to make matters worse he has also been fired so what is our green haired protagonist to do? Teaming up with is sprightly revolutionist girlfriend Cha Yeongmi Bae Du Na Ryu plans to kidnap the daughter of his former boss. Things go well at first but of course the situation becomes worse and worse for Ryu.This is a frightening film. There were some truly terrifying moments in Oldboy but this films works on a more visceral level. One can almost feel the tension boiling within Ryu and the desperation that he must feel in his desire to aid his older sister. Also it should be mentioned that the acting of Sang Gang Ho playing the part of the kidnapped girl's father is extraordinary. He is definitely the most aggressive and frightening character in the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a wonderful and compelling movie. Chanwook Park as done a brilliant job with the themes he introduces and I enjoyed it a lot more than I did 2003's Oldboy which is enjoyable too if you're able to suspend your disbelief from a great height!. Firstly I'd have to comment on the fantastic cinematography. Byeongil Kim did such a good job. Every frame seems full of meticulous detail every scene filled with such an atmosphere that it's hard not to be pulled in to the film without realising it. Every shot was great and was so carefully thought out.The plot of the film kept me intrigued. At first I felt that I wasn't being shown enough of what was going on but i came to realise that although not all events were portrayed with absolute clarity I knew exactly what was happening. I knew what was going on despite hearing little from the character's mouths and knowing few of their thoughts such was the quality of Park's direction. It was almost like I was viewing the film from the perspective of a deaf mute myself hearing little but still picking up on everything that occurred. It was an excellent way of portraying the story.The narrative revolves around the motivations intentions and consequences of revenge and relates these abstract matters in a clever way. It forces us to question the very nature of revenge and it is hard to come out with any clear answers. On one hand you fully understand the motivations for vengeance but on the other the film is full of motifs that make us question if it really is the right course of action. This moral ambiguity prevents us from any simplistic moralising and as we watch good people doing bad things we really have to question the meaning behind the title 'Sympathy For Mr Vengeance'. Who should our sympathies lie with? Is it an ironic title? After seeing the movie such questions were prominent in my mind and I think that a film that sticks with you like this cannot be regarded as an average attempt.There was an amount of violence in the film but I did not find it as shocking as I had expected and I have seen far worse. The violence was well crafted and became part of the plot and substance of the film instead of being another reason to splash blood and gore in every direction. Instead the violence built on the already prominent themes making me wince at times but also aiding me in coming to terms with what the film was trying to say.Overall this movie is a great study of revenge and its effects on the soul. Check it out!".

Stop me if you've heard this one.Completed a year before 2003's Korean box office sensation Oldboy Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance is the second Chanwook Park film to play San Diego this year.

Sound plays a crucial role in Park's narrative. Along with this year's delirious It's All Gone Pete Tong Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance continues to explore new ways of filming deafness. Instead of muffled audio every time we adopt Ryu's pointofview a favored Hollywood approach Park amplifies his handicap through heightened ambient noise.

Ryu's green hair meshes with the factory's neon hues making him little more than a part of the environment. Moving from green to orange Park highlights the father's path to pay the ransom as skillfully as Hansel dispensing breadcrumbs. The relationship between the young hostage wearing an orange outercoat and her kidnapper with a springgreen dyejob are mirrored by a televised fox and frog cartoon.When a filmmaker chooses to strap on an anamorphic lens one hopes the decision was premeditated. Even a genius like Wong Karwai failed to impress with his pragmatic application of 'Scope in 2046. On the basis of only two films Park has proved to be a master of widescreen composition. Note the way he composes around a dresser when we first encounter Ryu and Youngmin in bed together. More than arty playfulness the scene presents a couple separated by something so vast and insurmountable that they barely fit in the small space that life and the frame affords them.Given the current political climate audiences are reluctant to drop ten dollars on a tale embroidered with despair. Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance has cinematic a vision backing it up. Were that not reason enough this summer screens were dominated by notsosuper heroes wretched TV knockoffs jock comedies and a band of lovable penguins that somehow migrated from the Discovery Channel to local multiplexes.".

However a tragedy happens generating revenge and a series of acts of violence.Boksuneun Naui Geot is the first movie of the Chanwook Park's vengeance trilogy and also excellent. The story is very well developed using ellipsis in a very appropriate way without disrupting the sequences. The characters and the situations are credible and there is no apology to revenge. On the contrary the lead character does not find any redemption with his acts and even questions them in the end. The movie is very violent therefore it is not recommended to sensitive persons. The relationship of the gorgeous Duna Bae Ruy's girlfriend and JiEun Lim Ryu's sister is a little confused to understand in the beginning but becomes clear when Cha Youngmi convinces Ryu to abduct Yossun. However I have not understood how the couple brought the little girl to their place. The masturbation scene supposed to be funny is actually very silly but does not spoil this great film. The angles of camera work are magnificent. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Mr. Vingana Mr. Vengeance".

Occasionally we lose one of the two ways in which we interact with the film sound sight.  The loss of one sense adds value to the other.  It makes the normally assumed other seem all the more there. Unlike most Hollywood takes on this particular sense absence we get a bit of a glimpse into what the absence means to the character and not just what it means to us looking at the character as third person.

The violence is a bit overwhelming especially given the tone of the initial third.  We start off thinking that maybe all planned actions will go as they should without harm and without significant consequence that implied violence might only exist beyond the threshold of common sense.  As plans slowly unravel and as tragedy exerts its sometimes tender hold we see an escalation of blood with few limits in depiction.Mr. Park and here I'm paraphrasing a translator's take has stated that the violence in this film is less bloody and less realistic ? than that found in horror movies or movies of other persuasion action?. What he says is true but in those movies we are distanced from the events via a somewhat thick veil of disbelief.  Unlikely characters and unlikely events combine for a combustion that makes it easy for to be distant from the gore.  While the characters in this film might be unlikely they are drawn with the kind of SYMPATHY that allows their environs to seem more plausible or possible.  Mr. Park also stressed the elements of class struggle although my familiarity with South Korean culture leaves me uncertain of all their applications.  There certainly is a sense of have vs. havenot in the film and this seems to reveal itself most significantly near the end.The story may be told somewhat elliptically so English only audiences beware especially if you require the tried and true formulas that Hollywood so often provides.".

Chanwook Park however is masterful toying with us making us imagine horrific scenes and feel choking anxiety for the characters. Of course he's brilliant for the eyes too. The image of Park Dongjin following the organ dealers up the stairs of the abandoned building is able to convey the desolation of that building and the difficulty of the climb with simple layout and angle.

But SYMPATHY is very different as there are several people wronged in one way or another and the only clearcut bad guys may be the shady organ dealers explained below but are really just bit players in a much larger and more complex picture.

Desperate to help his sister and with no donor in sight in the near future Ryu goes to a black market organ dealer who offers to provide a kidney  in return for 10 million won roughly 10 thousand U.S. currently and one of his own kidneys. Ryu agrees  but is rippedoff and left with one kidney and no money. As bad luck would have it a legit donor turns up for Ryu's sister  but now they have no money and no way to come up with the cash in the one week before the scheduled operation. Out of sheer desperation Ryu and his girlfriend hatch a plan to kidnap Ryu's rich exboss's daughter to ransom her for the money for the operation. When the kidnapping accidentally goes horribly wrong  a chain of events is set into motion that will cause great suffering for everyone involved...SYMPATHY FOR MR.

Beautifully filmed and acted  this is not an action packed film but everything is developed and handled methodically  up to and including the explosive ending. The very last scene seemed a little outofwhack to me...but it was a decent way to tie up any remaining loose ends and to make sure that everyone involved was dealt an equal hand of justice. An excellent film and highly recommended . I also enjoyed ChanWook Park's OLDBOY  but SYMPATHY is definitely the better film. With two of the three vengeance films under my belt  I'm anxiously awaiting Park's final film in the series  LADY VENGEANCE. 910 for SYMPATHY".

Though it is dark and violent this movie is truly great for a number of reasons great acting nicely paced and original plot with great characters. There is however one more reason why this movie is truly great. This movie has social context embedded into the plot making the movie more meaningful and significant.Some people might see this movie and be shocked at some of the violent scenes which might lead them to compare this movie with mindless Japanese movies though I'm not bashing Japanese films. However in my opinion 'Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance' uses its shocking scenes to show the tragic situation and meaninglessness of the division between the two Koreas. Though there are so many small components that support this claim the two characters epitomizes this Ryu's girl friend i.e. Duna Bae's character who is a communist Ryu's former boss i.e. Kangho Song's character who is a capitalistic owner of a big company. Both characters end up killing each other though they really meant no harm. Ryu I believe represents the common people who are hurt just because they are involved. Then Ryu's sister represents the idea of peace and love. If this interpretation is correct the director Chanwook Park's forecast of the two Koreas are also grim like this movie.I strongly want to encourage others to watch this movie and make their assessment on what this movie is trying to say. Otherwise this movie is just another great 2 hour entertainment.".

Due to the missing subtitles for the murmuring of a dying character at the end I can promise the nonKorean speaking audience an hourlong discussion of the political message which appears multileveled to me. I am quite pleased about all the aesthetical risks this movie takes. Surprises that face its protagonists will also stun the viewers.

Plenty of laughs throughout and allround great performances. 910".

Firstperformance of the voice of Robin Williams is very wonderful.For example he uses a lot of funny ad lib in the standin of animation in the first scene. Second Robin Williams and Sally Field as well as the three children act very delightfully though the movie deals with a rather serious themewarmth and importance of family. Some people say Sally Field doesn't act well in this movie. But I think that she acts a role of a wife whom is worried about her husband excelentlly. We feel big love of both father and mother toward children. It is not only a real funny comedy but also a real wonderful family movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "MRS. DOUBTFIRE 1993 12Starring Robin Williams Sally Field Mara Wilson and Pierce BrosnanDirected by Chris Columbus. Written by Leslie Dixon and Randi Mayem Singer. Running time 125 minutes. Rated PG13 for sexual references and some language By Blake FrenchMrs. Doubtfire is one of the most invigorating vivid character studies to be produced on the big screen this decade. Most of the characters are strongly executed with decisive dialogue. They are also beautifully written with tainted personalities and uncompromising wit. Chris Columbus has assembled a stellar dramatic comedy with excellent screen writing giving audiences one of the most punctually artful films I have ever witnessed.The opening scene is as brilliantly structured as screen writing otherwise comes. It has a middleaged man named Daniel whom we learn about as he quits his job as a vocal performer for a children's cartoon after he realizes his employers are immoral. This sequence provides us with a development of the character's inner personality strong morals and consciences. The audience also leans that he is a silly easy going person. We soon find out it is these characteristics that propel the movie into the first plot point.Daniel's wife Miranda wishes to divorce him because he is too goofy and immature. We are propelled quickly into the firm second act after the divorce. Before this point we have witnessed both actions and dialogue reallocating Daniel's love and compassion for his family especially his children. The film sets up the for following events using Robin Williams character as the plot advancer.Daniel lusts for time with his children so much he confidentially disguises himself as a sixty year old woman then applies for a daycare job for his exwifethis would allow him to be around his children more often. Miranda falls for it and the master of disguise gets his opportunity. The film then takes us through a hilarious and emotional journey into the lives of a typical American divorced family.The internal problem becomes more complex when Daniel's ex wife shows romantic interest in a new boyfriend underplayed by Pierce Brosnan. The filmmakers could have done more with the Brosnan character. Here he seems developed with repetition and dialogue. Although his purpose is to accommodate romantic competition we don't know enough about him to care that much.Mrs. Doubtfire contains some material that fairs as overly blunt and outwardly apprehensive. Although the overall presentation is understandable and relative I still think the picture could have been better with more careful script writing. Even such we are able to witness a powerful touching film with a conclusion that is so settling you will cry with joy.Brought to you by 20th Century Fox.".

	schema:reviewBody "For me this was the funniest movie I ever saw. Not normally a huge fan of comedy I was just about rolling in the theatre aisles during this gem. Robin Williams is brilliant in his 'dual role' as the rejected husband Daniel and the buxom British nanny Mrs. Doubtfire.This movie tells the story of a bitter separation when Miranda insists on a divorce from her immature goofy husband. Daniel denied custody and given only limited visitation concocts a female nanny character for himself in order to gain daily access to his three children. The kids grow to love and depend on their unusual but very concerned and efficient new nanny Mrs. Doubtfire who really gets the household running extremely smoothly. Of course meanwhile Miranda has a new love interest named Stu.Williams' portrayal of Mrs. Doubtfire is hilarious in every way shape and form. The wig stockings dress make up...it's all too amusing watching Daniel transform for the part. Wait till you see Mrs. Doubtfire cooking! The most insanely funny scene is at a restaurant where Daniel  Mrs. Doubtfire must quickly be in two places at the same time so he  she is forced to alternate between personae at lightning speed sometimes forgetting which one he  she is at any given moment. I won't give away the plot but I nigh expired from laughing.Sally Field charmingly plays Daniel's now separated wife Miranda and Pierce Brosnan is suitably unsympathetic as her new love interest Stu. We cheer for Daniel through his assorted antics as he tries to shoo away this romantic competitor for his ex wife's affections and especially this new male threatening to usurp his role as father to his kids.Desite being a comedy this film does on the serious side reveal the devastating effects of divorce on children's lives and also particularly on the noncustodial parent. Daniel is distraught as he misses seeing his kids every day. Furthermore the entrance of a new love interest naturally adds to the general strife.Where did Mrs. Doubtfire get her unusual name? Does she live on or fizzle out at movie's end? Will Daniel and Miranda get back together or will Stu prevail? I won't divulge any spoilers but I guarantee you'll fall in love with this lovable large nanny and wish you could have her babysit your own kids. Mrs. Doubtfire will certainly live on in your heart.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a thoroughly enjoyable movie. I really like Robin Williams an actor that is I personally don't care for him that much as a comedian and the roles of Daniel Hillard and Mrs Doubtfire were perfect for him. While he was fine as Daniel it is his tourdeforce performance of Mrs Doubtfire that drives the film. Plus the make up used on him was fantastic. Also worthy of credit is director Chris Columbus who nails the use of Williams's exuberance and quickfire personality and because of this every gag hits the right buttons. There are cracking set pieces such as the make up experiments and the series of table hopping quick changes. And I for one liked the routine with the dinosaur it wasn't one of the better gags but it was funny. Pierce Brosnan also does surprisingly well as the bachelor looking for a readymade family and Mara Wilson gives one of her better performances as Natalie very delightful and charming her performance was. The script is also funny and touching the score is warm and sweet and the film is very nice to look at. Some people didn't like the ending but I had no real problem with it personally. My only complaints are that the film is a little too long and Sally Field overdoes the exasperation slightly as the mother but overall this is a delightful film no matter how many times you see it you are likely to love it every time whether it is Williams the gags or Wilson. 910 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "I was only seven years old when this PG13 rated dramedy came into theatres and I think its existence went unnoticed by me until very early in 2007 when I saw it on TV. Just before watching it I knew it starred talented comedianactor Robin Williams whom I was a big fan of and knew it was about his character disguised as a woman which certainly sounded promising for a comedy. My first viewing of Mrs. Doubtfire was definitely not one to forget and I got more than just laughs out of it. After that my second viewing three years later didn't disappoint me at all. My opinion on Williams as a performer hasn't changed since 2007 and watching this movie again turned out to be a lot like the first time.Daniel Hillard is a voiceover actor who quits his job after an argument with his boss. He is also the loving but irresponsible father of Lydia Chris and Natalie. Just after quitting his job he throws a chaotic disruptive outofcontrol birthday party for Chris. After his wife Miranda finds out about this she is fed up and decides it's time for a divorce after fourteen years of marriage. Daniel goes to live in an apartment and gets to see his kids once a week every Saturday evening but this is not often enough for him. When he learns that Miranda is looking for someone to hire as a housekeeper he decides to take advantage of his voice and acting skills and creates himself a new alter ego a sixty year old woman named Mrs. Iphegenia Doubtfire. In his disguise he applies for the housekeeping job and gets it so he now gets to see his offspring every day again. This goes well and being Mrs. Doubtfire turns out to be an educational experience for him but how long will he be able to hide the fact that Mrs. Doubtfire is actually Daniel Hillard? With the opening sequence showing Daniel Hillard Robin Williams in the studio recording his voiceovers and then getting into an argument with his boss and quitting the movie is off to a good and comical start. It stays fairly consistent throughout with many memorably funny scenes such as the birthday party Daniel doing numerous voice impressions in front of social worker Mrs. Sellner the divorced father having to change back and forth from Mrs. Doubtfire to himself while Mrs. Sellner is in his apartment Stu Dunmeyer Miranda's new love interest calling Daniel a loser in front of Mrs. Doubtfire not realizing it's him and getting fruit thrown at him and many other things that happen on the main character's little adventure as well as some funny lines coming from his alter ego. Most of the drama in this film was also well done with decent dialogue and there certainly are some poignant scenes. Both the humour and the serious parts help keep it interesting. Williams shows not only his comedic talent here but also his acting abilities. Most of the other cast performances are decent enough here. There was something I didn't like about the two older Hillard kids Lydia and Chris not sure how to describe it but they certainly could have had worse family characters in this movie.This was directed by Chris Columbus and I haven't seen every film he has ever directed but have seen Home Alone 1  2 written by John Hughes Stepmom and the first two Harry Potter movies. I haven't seen those Harry Potter flicks in years and don't know how they compare but I would definitely say that Mrs. Doubtfire is superior to the other three films I've seen from Columbus. Of course these movies all had different writers so it wasn't entirely Columbus who made them what they are but it's interesting to compare this film with Stepmom. Both films involve family trouble and are apparently supposed to be a mix of comedy and drama but the 1998 release fails in both genres with a fairly poor script and generally unlikable characters and I really don't think either of those can describe this 1993 dramedy! This one may have its flaws but there's still so much to make it satisfying even at just over two hours long.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd just like to point out before I say anything about Mrs. Doubtfire that it does not even come close to surpassing Tootsie as the best comedy using this manindrag routine. At the same time it definitely picked up its concept from the Dustin Hoffman classic but I sincerely believe it does not attempt to pattern itself on that previous film either. This new entry with a man in a dress has its own story its own heart tenderly in place and has a lot of fun in the process. Even though it may not be brilliant like Tootsie Doubtfire has wonderfully comic moments wrapped up into a heartwarming tale.Robin Williams stars as Daniel Hillard a gifted voiceover actor who has a unique fondness for his three children but is unable to hold down a steady job. When his wife Miranda Sally Field asks him for a divorce Daniel is left in an unfortunate situation. Miranda gets sole custody of the children and Daniel is able to see them every weekend but he is not satisfied. He therefore asks his brother Harvey Fierstein a expert makeup artist to turn him into a woman. Enter Mrs. Doubtfire a 60year old Brit who quickly becomes a housekeeper for the family. Daniel is able to return to his kids' lives fulltime in some form or another.This premise may seem a bit contrived and may get you wondering how he could fool his exwife and kids into the whole scheme. The costuming and makeup looks good on Williams but is it good enough? This is where Williams adds those comic touches and sugary substance to make Mrs. Doubtfire seem genuine. I truly liked both characters Robin plays even though I didn't get a total sensation that the two were totally different entities. The film makers ask you to go along with it without too much argument and as a matter of fact I did.The movie's real triumph I believe is in its realism of divorce and its effect on parents and especially their children. Some may think the film's second act as ludicrous when Robin Williams tries to chase off Field's new boyfriend Pierce Brosnan. I don't think it was as much his jealousy over his wife that came into play but rather being unable to accept another man entering into what was his place in their family structure. Here you see a quiet nobility in his character not that we totally dislike Brosnan or consider him a villain but that we assimilate with Robin's cause. This gives the excessive slapstick and tomfoolery a deeper edge.I think film critics should have a heart when it comes to Mrs. Doubtfire. It does have a certain magic to it that is so hard to find in movies nowadays. I was moved by it I laughed quite a bit and overall had a good time. When it comes to entertainment nothing else really matters. Rating Three stars.".

He therefore asks his brother Harvey Fierstein a expert makeup artist to turn him into a woman. Enter Mrs. Doubtfire a 60year old Brit who quickly becomes a housekeeper for the family. Daniel is able to return to his kids' lives fulltime in some form or another.This premise may seem a bit contrived and may get you wondering how he could fool his exwife and kids into the whole scheme. The costuming and makeup looks good on Williams but is it good enough? This is where Williams adds those comic touches and sugary substance to make Mrs. Doubtfire seem genuine. I truly liked both characters Robin plays even though I didn't get a total sensation that the two were totally different entities. The film makers ask you to go along with it without too much argument and as a matter of fact I did.The movie's real triumph I believe is in its realism of divorce and its effect on parents and especially their children. Some may think the film's second act as ludicrous when Robin Williams tries to chase off Field's new boyfriend Pierce Brosnan. I don't think it was as much his jealousy over his wife that came into play but rather being unable to accept another man entering into what was his place in their family structure. Here you see a quiet nobility in his character not that we totally dislike Brosnan or consider him a villain but that we assimilate with Robin's cause. This gives the excessive slapstick and tomfoolery a deeper edge.I think film critics should have a heart when it comes to Mrs. Doubtfire. It does have a certain magic to it that is so hard to find in movies nowadays. I was moved by it I laughed quite a bit and overall had a good time. When it comes to entertainment nothing else really matters. Rating Three stars.";

The main characters are fully aware of the speed with which the city breathes and the crowds of people that pass they attempt to fight time develop recognizable identities yet still feel lost in the big place. These thoughts lead the woman character played by Seong Hyeona to a conclusion that the only way to keep her lover is to not tire the relationship and for such it is necessary that she undergoes plastic surgery. Her lover doesn't know that he's forced to live six months without any idea where she's gone to if she's alive whether she's dumped him or not and most importantly if he should keep his heart open to her love and possibly hope for her comeback.These are heartbreaking moments but surprisingly the Czech audience took them rather easily most repeatedly laughed at scenes which are funny but at the same time raise important question and for my taste require much attention paid.During the six months in which the woman's face is fixing up the movie centers around her lover and the life he's attempting to live at that time the movie is floating endlessly introducing new characters if I'm not mistaken all played by the same great actress. It is entertaining but at the same time includes thoughts revolving around existence recognition individuality and similar. Eventually both ends meet with funny yet consequent twist at the end.Similarly to one of the author's previous movie 3Iron the movie feels like a soft ballad shots composed with a beautiful sense for color reflections and composition but also shakycam feeling whenever necessary. Although Time is set in a huge city places are revisited again and memorized on photos as are the characters. Unusually for Kim KiDuk there is also lots of dialogue included fortunately enough not only does that not wear out but it's often pretty entertaining.Summed up Time was a beautiful experience a movie that completely carried me away. If you're planning on seeing it do not underestimate the somewhat light appearance it deals with very important issues and it deals with them thoroughly. Pay attention and you'll be rewarded big time.".

	schema:reviewBody "A poet said that there are 3 types of love First for a REASON... You love someone for a reasonbecause she's beautifulbecause she's special etc. Second is to love AS... You love someone as good as she loves youas much as you love your mum etc. Third is to love DESPITE... Despite she's ugly despite she's moody despite she's lighthearted etc. Then he added to truly love someone is to accept herhis nature with pros and cons altogether.In Kim Kiduk's Shi ganTime the whole plot is based on a Korean couple who are at their mid20s. Even though they're getting prepared to marry they don't realize that their relation is still relying on reasons. Like every fresh couple since they don't express their needs and wishes to each other their harmony goes downhill by time. SehHee surprisingly leaves her lover without any warning or explanation due to her jealousy on him. She decides to have a plastic surgery to get a more beautiful face than she has. That way when she comes back she'll feel more comfortable for securing her love through her beauty. In other words she leaves him for the shortfall of trust in their relationship. Right here at the character intro scenesthe first halfanhour there's a drastic message You love someone for a reason you'll lose herhim for another.Kim Kiduk has set his screenplay out for reflecting the social affinity of South Korean women to plastic surgery. Social statistics mark that South Korea is among the world's top 3 countries regarding this subject. Kim Kiduk's cinema language carries a great focus on the main plot and he enriches this focus with use of Symbolism. Just like in a poet each word and each act represents a deeper meaning more than itself. This creates a few memorable scenes First in the public ferryboat scene second the scene with sculptures and figurines at the beach park third the change of the tide on the beach when lovers are parted finally before the closure most of the SehHee's parts carry Symbolism in words 1If we turn around and make eye contact then we should meet again. One two three...means my eyes were at you when you were with other women if you've ever been aware of that I'd never have left you 2You should realize how happy you are just do well on your partmeans you must be happy for being loved by me 3Things happening suddenly when something lost it never comes backmeans love happens all of a sudden when you're loved you're not aware of it the moment you start to aware of someone's love it vanishes awayInstead of trying to express the feelings with words Kim Kiduk hides the true meanings away which may also mean that he kept a secret between him and his characters against us. It's truly to see how deep a love can get with keeping it as a secret. This concept was very rare to come across. On the other hand even though the main plot is unique its subplotplastic surgery is not.In cinema history there are notable films within various genres featuring plastic surgery. Starting to count let's look at the dramaromance genre first In Elizabeth Taylor's popular drama movie Ash Wednesday1973 Taylor's character tends to have plastic surgery for the same reason as SehHee herein to retain her lover's attention on her. From the recent years Alejandro Amenabar's Abre Los Ojos and its Hollywood copycat Vanilla Sky tell the offbase story of a playboy's lose of his handsome face due to a traffic accident and his captious dreams of regaining his face with plastic surgery. From the TV 2005's Golden Globe winner TVdrama NipTuck was taking its departure with two plastic surgeons of opposite personalities.Plastic surgery was also memorable in Robert Zemeckis's Death Becomes Her1992 where Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn were making up a fun out of this subject. Addictive to look younger these aged ladies were competing with each other via having plastic surgeries until they explore a youth elixir. Another funny example of a plastic surgery comedy had been featuring in a scene in Terry Gilliam's Brazil1985 where the leading character's mother wants to have plastic surgery without anaesthesia while she's wideawake. Whereas in the horror genre the plastic surgery has used very seriously. The cult filmmaker Jesus Franco's Faceless1987 was a psychopathic crime story in which a plastic surgeon kidnaps a beautiful model to stitch up her face into his sister's. Dated 1960 the British horror Circus of Horrors told another crime story of a plastic surgeon who takes his patients prisoner to work as models at a circus of horrors. Maybe the earliest example to a plastic surgery concept on the silverscreen was Humphrey Bogart's Dark Passage1947. This was an unique crimethriller movie having Humphrey Bogart as a criminal's new face after the plastic surgery which made it easier for him to hide away from the police. In the other crimethriller movies that used plastic surgery in its content Michael Caine's The Jigsaw Man displayed a KGB agent who sent to Britain for misleading targets. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage's Face Off on the other hand brought a fresh idea of shifting agents with each other by means of plastic surgery. Looking at a Turkish TV epic of crime genre Kurtlar Vadisi displayed a MIT spy becoming a Mafia boss after a successful plastic surgery altering into a new identity.For now the last sample of this plot is Shi gan which is among the top ten most important movies of the decade through its unique cinema language. Shi gan develops a story from separation of lovers and connects it with plastic surgery then climbs up the relationship ladder to become a cure for parted couples. It's a mustsee for everyone who is seeking a good drama to watch.".

One two three...means my eyes were at you when you were with other women if you've ever been aware of that I'd never have left you 2You should realize how happy you are just do well on your partmeans you must be happy for being loved by me 3Things happening suddenly when something lost it never comes backmeans love happens all of a sudden when you're loved you're not aware of it the moment you start to aware of someone's love it vanishes awayInstead of trying to express the feelings with words Kim Kiduk hides the true meanings away which may also mean that he kept a secret between him and his characters against us. It's truly to see how deep a love can get with keeping it as a secret. This concept was very rare to come across. On the other hand even though the main plot is unique its subplotplastic surgery is not.In cinema history there are notable films within various genres featuring plastic surgery. Starting to count let's look at the dramaromance genre first In Elizabeth Taylor's popular drama movie Ash Wednesday1973 Taylor's character tends to have plastic surgery for the same reason as SehHee herein to retain her lover's attention on her. From the recent years Alejandro Amenabar's Abre Los Ojos and its Hollywood copycat Vanilla Sky tell the offbase story of a playboy's lose of his handsome face due to a traffic accident and his captious dreams of regaining his face with plastic surgery. From the TV 2005's Golden Globe winner TVdrama NipTuck was taking its departure with two plastic surgeons of opposite personalities.Plastic surgery was also memorable in Robert Zemeckis's Death Becomes Her1992 where Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn were making up a fun out of this subject. Addictive to look younger these aged ladies were competing with each other via having plastic surgeries until they explore a youth elixir. Another funny example of a plastic surgery comedy had been featuring in a scene in Terry Gilliam's Brazil1985 where the leading character's mother wants to have plastic surgery without anaesthesia while she's wideawake. Whereas in the horror genre the plastic surgery has used very seriously. The cult filmmaker Jesus Franco's Faceless1987 was a psychopathic crime story in which a plastic surgeon kidnaps a beautiful model to stitch up her face into his sister's. Dated 1960 the British horror Circus of Horrors told another crime story of a plastic surgeon who takes his patients prisoner to work as models at a circus of horrors. Maybe the earliest example to a plastic surgery concept on the silverscreen was Humphrey Bogart's Dark Passage1947. This was an unique crimethriller movie having Humphrey Bogart as a criminal's new face after the plastic surgery which made it easier for him to hide away from the police. In the other crimethriller movies that used plastic surgery in its content Michael Caine's The Jigsaw Man displayed a KGB agent who sent to Britain for misleading targets. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage's Face Off on the other hand brought a fresh idea of shifting agents with each other by means of plastic surgery. Looking at a Turkish TV epic of crime genre Kurtlar Vadisi displayed a MIT spy becoming a Mafia boss after a successful plastic surgery altering into a new identity.For now the last sample of this plot is Shi gan which is among the top ten most important movies of the decade through its unique cinema language. Shi gan develops a story from separation of lovers and connects it with plastic surgery then climbs up the relationship ladder to become a cure for parted couples. It's a mustsee for everyone who is seeking a good drama to watch.";

	schema:reviewBody "There is something startlingly relevant to this film. The ever increasing lack of identity in the modern world and the rise of all sorts of abstract selves from Internet IDs to Social Security numbers has left our age with nothing but ever changing faces and dubious selves. The most corporeal and brutal example of this is cosmetic surgery. And Kim KiDuk's haunting masterpiece speaks to both the obsession with a physical ideal as well as the very ambiguous ideology of identity.As a cynical and often apathetic moviegoer this film entranced bewildered and truly disconcerted me. Kim KiDuk is developing into an incredible filmmaker. The cinematography is delicately crisp in a way that is very new and only really found in a handful of Asian movies from about the last 5 years. The dramatic elements are utterly profound and the plot functions on many levels though not specifically allegorical invoking and evoking issues ranging from history the failure and ultimate relativism of communication the absurd necessity for beauty as well as a plethora of other parallels.Anyhow I find myself being verbose but I just watched this movie and am terribly excited about it. Instead the film itself is anything but convoluted and though not exceedingly complex is incredibly deep. Be patient because it starts a little slowly but erupts into something so strange and meaningful that I would recommend this film to anyone that enjoys Asian cinema or that likes to think.".

In some ways it reminded me of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind with this weird sense of starting with a clean slate.The idea of not being able to recognize a past lover is extremely disturbing to me personally and so I might have allowed myself to get taken in by this film more than some people would.

It is my opinion that he takes audiences to places in Korean culture that other Korean filmmakers dare not go. I had been waiting to see this film on the screen but the opportunity has yet to come. I was thrilled when a pal sent me the just released DVD. Kiduk Kim's work is surreal sociopolitical and melodramatic all at once. This can be an uncomfortable combination. I find that there is often a dark comedic element at work in his films which makes it all the more uncomfortable. In fact I often wonder if the comedy I find is intended. As a viewer I don't care. I find his work endlessly interesting and unforgettable. This is not his finest work. It is however a visually stunning work. At it's heart are two central ideas playing off each other the 21st century obsession with plastic surgery and the obsessive quality of lovedevotion. The film is filled with character insecurity and the neurotic. The surreal set up for this film is also a bit too confused. However I would urge anyone interested in his work or the films that are coming out of Asis to seek this film out. There has been criticism of the theatrics of the performers. While I understand this issue I feel the actors give exactly what Kim was after. The pitch of the performances match the overthetop story line. This is an intellectual film. I think what I love the most is the fact that it is visually intellectual vs. plot driven intellectual. I am not sure I managed to get that idea out but I hope whoever reads this understands what I am trying to articulate.".

	schema:reviewBody "The most widely read review of mine is The Intimate Aien starring Sung HyunAh. So I think fans of her from the show will not want to miss this movie by Kim KiDuk also starring the same actress. While The Intimate was more erm intimate I labelled it as Serendipity with loads of sex fans of hers shouldn't be put off by this Kim KiDuk movie. I must admit I haven't hunted down the other movies that he's done  this marks his 13th feature film and my other exposure to his works were 3Iron and The Bow. While I enjoyed the two I mentioned this one takes the cake.Korea is perhaps also famously known for its number of female population going under the knife to look good. I've been to a number of Korean cities and yes they are gorgeous. But there's always that skeptical doubt hanging over their heads whether they had undergone plastic surgery to enhance their various assets. That is the subject of which Time touches upon.Seh Hee Park JiYeon and Ji Woo Ha JungWoo are a couple and coupledom is always disastrous when one party is paranoid with suspicion over the other being unfaithful. A longer than usual glance at another pretty face or a kind gesture to help a gorgeous person will bring on alarm bells violent exchange of words and an inexplicable bad attitude and demeanour towards others. That's how Seh Hee behaves and I suppose those who suffer from low selfesteem and confidence would probably exhibit one or many of the traits put forth. SPOILERS AHEADAnd it is indeed these traits that will put any relationship under strain with unreasonableness being the number one reaction felt by the other party. Unconfident about her looks Suh Hee goes under the plastic surgeon's knife and in certain aspects starts to tease her ex boyfriend Ji Woo whom she left abruptly 6 months back in a huff and without explanation with her new physical self in the form of Sung HyunAh.While Ji Woo is being confronted with the shock of being left all alone and his inability to forget Seh Hee what do you expect from a man who loves someone so deeply yet she suddenly disappears from your life with nary a word? And how will you react when faced with the truth?END SPOILERS SPOILER THOUGHTSPerhaps the message in the movie is about the importance of looks or the perceived emphasis placed on physical attractiveness. It isn't enough to just look good when different and the psychological change that you now have the opportunity to be someone different is just as if not more important and this aspect of well being has to be looked after as well. Watching this movie brings about some comparison of story lines and the differing techniques used to carve out a new life with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In Eternal one becomes somebody new by undergoing a science fictional transformation with the wiping of memories from the mind. It's psychological and the technology not here yet. With Time it involves the transformation of the physical with technology already ready and very sophisticated in technique. And that's what makes it quite scary barring the gory introductory scene.I could literally transform my face into something else and thereafter with the severing of current ties with friends and family lead a completely different life. The objective of Seh Hee in the movie can indeed drive someone nuts and even drive yourself nuts as you discover you're living a lie and you can do nothing about it to reverse the process. But if your life is in a rut would you be tempted to do it? For the reasons of Suh Hee of being someone else to test the fidelity of your other half is just plain crazy and you'll easily come to see why it's a loselose situation from the start  he loves you now so that says a lot about his affection for you in the past He doesn't love the present you as he still can't forget and is still holding onto hopes of seeking the old you out which will leave the current you miserable because you've already physically transformed. Ooh it's one heck of a mind exercise.END SPOILER THOUGHTSI would deem this movie very accessible paced very well and has enough moments to keep you riveted and guessing the outcome at each step of the way. But it's not plain sailing and he does keep you guessing time and again deliberately leaving some questions unanswered providing you with plenty of room for discussion. For those who liked to be tease and dislike being spoonfed with the movie's narrative.".

	schema:headline " Interesting idea  but story and performances lack credibility";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film at the opening of the Karlovy Vary film festival. The story focuses on the themes of identity vanity and the constant pressure to improve our own personal appearance. The story revolves around the central female character who undergoes radical plastic surgery in order to ensure that her lover does not grow bored of her appearance. The narrative builds an increasingly complex story woven around the central female and male characters and also utilises 34 key locations including a coffee shop and sculpture park. Yet the narrative is very unevenly paced  initially it deliberately takes very little time to set the basic premise of the story but then after dragging out the middle section of the story the final series of events seem to pass at a frankly ludicrous pace. Little time is taken to explore motives or explain events and as a result potentially dramatic scenes are given little context. One reviewer was surprised that the audience at the premiere laughed during serious scenes  my personal opinion is that many viewers found the events unbelievable and unrealistic  hence the incredulous reaction. This problem was further compounded by a weak performance from the central male character. The character is largely bewildered by events but then as the story unfolds he goes through wider mood swings that are not conveyed in a way that makes the viewer believe or empathise with these emotions. Personally  I found as the story developed I gradually lost interest in the characters and the conclusion to the story was predictable convenient and overengineered.".

	schema:reviewBody "The title of the movie is an indication that the story happens under the sign of time and periods same as in other of Kiduk Kim's movies like the fabulous 'Spring Summer Autumn Winter... and Spring'. Here the cycle lasts six months the time it takes for a plastic surgery patient to completely recover and for his or her external appearance to change to the limit of not being recognized even by a lover. External appearance change means that the person changed? Can plastic surgery fool love? or destiny? To what extent what we are is how we look? This film of Kim is different in cinematography it leaves almost completely the traditional Korea setting of other films of his and happens in the modern and futuristic Korean landscape which even led some folks to shelve it as a sciencefiction movie which it is not in my opinion. If some of the refined camera work from other movies is missing here the only exception is the statues park where the characters come from time to time to take snapshots of themselves and of their physical changes. This very landscape which as the film progresses is more and more submerged in water metaphor of another universe that is overtaking the reality. This universe is under water invisible to us like telling to not look for understanding and transparency in a world different than ours.This is also a love story but a cruel one and a different one. It all starts like a soap opera a young couple breaks away and she decides to play the cruel game of changing her appearance to test if his love can be triggered again if physically she becomes somebody else. It so happens that his was a true love and when she shows up at the threshold of a six month cycle he is torn between the attraction for the new relationship and the feelings for the lost and disappeared true love. When truth surfaces he is the one who tries to take revenge but the closing of the cycle turns into tragedy. Men  women relationships can never be symmetric.Some critics do not consider 'Shi gan' as one of Kim's best film. Well if this is a relative failure I prefer Kim's failure to many other movies.".

Her plan is to then insinuate herself back into Jiwoo's life under the guise of her new identity hoping to stave off his growing indifference and in so doing give them what amounts to a second chance as a couple. Needless to say Sehhee 's scheme does not work out quite as planned and she learns some pretty powerful lessons about the way true love actually works.Although Sehhee clearly believes that by altering her appearance she will be able to change her inner makeup as well the truth is that she remains every bit as grasping jealous melodramatic and paranoid after the surgery as she was before. No amount of change in her looks can raise her selfesteem or make her any less difficult to deal with. Her boyfriend meanwhile becomes a pawn in her twisted game as he is tricked into inadvertently rekindling a romance with a woman who carries with her all the same baggage he had so much trouble putting up with in the previous relationship despite the fact that he genuinely loves her.An attack on the looksobsessed nature of modern culture Time is not a thriller in the conventional sense of the term. It demands patience as it goes about the business of laying out its storyline and doesn't go in for a whole lot of fancy horror movie pyrotechnics to raise the audience's hackles. Instead it relies mainly on subtle psychological insights to generate a feeling of imbalance and unease. Sehhee is clearly mentally and emotionally unstable and writerdirector Kiduk Kim's subtle almost Pirandellian way of dealing with that madness makes it all the more disturbing. Strong performances steady direction sharp cinematography and an unnerving view of human nature all combine to make Time an offbeat memorable experience. Don't expect to jump out of your seat or bury your face in your hands during the course of this film  for in the case of Time the chills all take place in the mind.".

I have heard talks that Kim Kiduk is not always appreciated in Korea and I had a chance to ensure this myself with my Korean friends here in the UK who didn't seem too fascinated about the stories we watched in 'Spring Summer Fall...' and 'Samaria' I didn't dare to suggest them to watch 'Seom'... perhaps that would have been too much to them.

Time is perhaps the director's most straightforward film which isn't necessarily a bad thing but in this case the lack of complexity and hyperrealism found in some of his better films makes this one a failure by comparison. Time makes some fairly obvious statements about identity jealousy and attachment as opposed to real true love. No doubt some viewers especially those unfamiliar with the director's other work will find these statements deep and moving and the fairly pat and predictable narrative easy to follow. The director is nonetheless an artful cinematographer and this film is not without its charming scenes and symbolic and visual merit.

Time the movie is more of a metaphor rather than a straightforward story.At first I was wondering why the movie wasn't titled Face since one of the main characters early on decides to have her face changed through plastic surgery however it becomes clear that this movie is not interested so much in appearance as it first seems. It is firstly a movie about time.When we first meet the couple the movie revolves around Sehhee the girlfriend is suspicious of her boyfriend's commitment to faithfulness. She wonders if he is growing tired of her because they've been together too long. She ultimately decides to try and take their relationship back to the beginning. She wants it to be new in the hope that the newness will hold the relationship together. What she neglects however trite it sounds is the invaluability of time spent together. The characters spend much of the movie apart and the viewer knows that a sad prophecy of loneliness is unfolding.While the movie can function as a cautionary tale it isn't really that engaging. Sehhee is obsessive insecure selfish since she's more interested in being loved than loving and completely jealous. Jiwoo seems to be inattentive and unresponsive to her concerns. Clearly there's a back story of dysfunction that we never see. Throughout the movie Sehhee spends so much of the time not listening and not believing her boyfriend as well as throwing tantrums that I couldn't sympathize with her. When you can't sympathize with the main character of a story in nearly any way the story has a problem. I'm not saying a character has to likable to be sympathetic but I am saying that for tragedy to work correctly and this is clearly a tragedy there has to be enough in a character that we wish to see redeemed so that when the character is damned we feel the appropriate emotional response of catharsis. I didn't feel it after watching Time.Twice during the movie a character tells Jiwoo that Sehhee must really love him. Neither character really seems to believe that's true. It's more of a nicety than anything else. We don't believe she loves him either and that's the problem with this film she doesn't love him she just wants to be loved by him.

This is an intermittently fascinating but flawed movie. When it's focusing on the manwoman dynamics it is authentic and raw and funny in a sick familiar way. When it's trying to be more clever than its inspiration it becomes longwinded and aimless. Like kiDuk's The Bow the film has an unsatisfactory resolution that fails to address the issues it has raised. Technical credits are fine and performances are all of a high caliber. This definitely falls into kiDuk Lite territory joining 3Iron The Bow and Spring Summer... I liked it more than 3Iron and The Bow but I was still disappointed that the director dropped the ball in the final act.".

His previous movies have been mostly silent but this film unfortunately reveals this hid a terrible ear for dialogue and a worse one for music. This is Korean TV melodrama bullshit with a little bit of token shock footage and philosophical questions shoehorned into it. This movie cheapens everything DiKuk has done before and if I had only seen this one I believe him to be a chauvinistic charlatan with absolutely no understanding of normal human interaction. My biggest criticism is that characters just randomly perform actions with no basis in psychology or their nature merely in order to provide neat symmetry visual moments or convoluted plot twists.

This film didn't resonate with me on any level. The problem is that the woman who is essentially our heroine is a bit crazy. I'm sure that her behavior may work if you take the actions as allegory but as something I'd hope to see in the real world it scares me She completely disappears when she gets the surgery to the extent that no one knows where she went. Even allowing that Kim's female characters are often damaged accepting the behavior here was tough going. I got around half way in and then started to jump around.

Ji Woo and See Hee are a couple that have been in a steady relationship for some time but things are getting a little stale and cracks are beginning to appear between the two of them.

With that she disappears with no word or explanation only to return six month later after extensive plastic surgery. Literally a new woman. Meanwhile JI Woo is distraught wondering where and why the love of his life has gone. Being left to wander dazed through the following days weeks and months until completely unaware what is in store for him See Hees plan to reunite them is set into motion. However when after several carefully engineered meetings she realises that her plan has badly backfired on her because despite his obvious physical attraction towards her new creation this new woman he is still very much in love with his disappeared soul mate. She realises that the only way to stand any chance of getting him back is to tell him what she has done. How this is resolved you will have to find out yourself... just remember you are watching a Kim Ki Duk movie. One reviewer made comment about the trend toward plastic surgery in Korea however I feel that this is missing the point. This is not about needing a face lift or a boob job this is about losing yourself completely. Total reinvention total lack of self esteem and self worth. This is not  he will like me better if my nose is straighter. This more distressingly is he will like me better if I am someone else !Forget the Korean connection this is a sad love story about insecurity jealousy fidelity and faith. It could have been told in any country in any language. In fact this movie over any of his others I can see being ripe for the inevitable American remake treatment. All of the directors trademarks are here the beautiful painterly images the suppressed anger and brief explosive moments of violence and of course the quiet leisurly pace at which he allows the the story to unfold. Stylistically imagine Greenaway shacked up with Haneke for the weekend you will get the idea. Although I understand Kim Ki Duk is not really appreciated in his home country at the moment I can only hope that with the passing of time no pun intended Korea realises that it can and hopefully will lay claim to one of the worlds true originals of modern cinema as it's own.".

Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust make your way towards Schindler's List.".

Ralph Fiennes character is especially vile but at the same time human.  He may be 95 evil but to not present a stereotypical and archetypical 100 bad character makes him infinately more realistic.  Filmed in black and white this story certainly shows the shades of gray that is the duality of man.  This is further exemplified by Schindler's own declaration of being a bad person because he could have done more good and saved more lives.".

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps I should be shot but I think four minutes of Springtime for Hitler is a more ingenious and powerful argument against antiSemitism than four hours of Shoah.Many Jews attribute the resilience of their culture to a capacity for laughter in the face of catastrophe. As Saul Bellow said Oppressed people tend to be witty. Pogroms didn't start with Hitler by the time the Spanish Inquisition burned a hundred thousand Jews the story of Jewish oppression already could fill many volumes. Many peoples once multitudinous have perished from the earth there are no Carthaginians left. There are no more Thracians to speak of. The Celts live only in musical traditions and some old literature having been subsumed by their conquerors. Their gods are dead and their languages or nearly so. But the Jews thrive on. Something kept hope alive under Stalin under Isabella under the Caesars. A sense of humor is a great virtue not to be undervalued.But in order to make sure I appreciate the horror of the events portrayed this movie cheats me of a glimpse at real life. The situations don't live as they might because all the time I'm being flogged with message. There is no even partially redeemable Nazi in this movie and Schindler's own latestage change of heart is presented with such suddenness that the movie veers into melodrama. And even melodrama need not be propaganda Minnelli and Ray always left us with choices. But Schindler must be classified as propaganda because it lacks the truth of even gallows humor which by many reports existed in great abundance in the ghettos and even in the death camps.The films of Bunuel and Altman are often political but rarely propagandist. The films of Michael Bay and Marcus Nispel are always propagandist and not always political though they are of course always bad. So propaganda need not be political and politics need not be propaganda. This shouldn't need saying but in the modern age of American politics it's worth remembering. I wish Steven Spielberg remembered it. One can define propaganda objectively as a sort of forced perspective a narrow range of potential reactions for the viewer. Propaganda is the use of art to persuade. It turns art into an expository essay. Propaganda is therefore by definition a limited form limited by its very agenda. The tools of propaganda become less necessary the more inherently obvious the subject matter the mass extermination of a people would seem to me to fit this category. So I think the style of this movie is unfortunately maudlin an overkill on the negative. I am not heartless I hate hate as much as anybody and I celebrate Jews and all humans as valuable and not for burning. But is there no other way to express a political point than to make me cry for three hours? The fact is that film as a medium lends itself to propaganda. There is a decision made about every angle literally the perspective is chosen for the viewer. This is not the case with other arts with musical performance acting writing sculpture but the more visual the medium the greater its tendency to make statements and the less its potential for ambiguity. It takes a lot of skill to manage a visual art form into something with real depth into a question rather than an answer.You can make propaganda about love like Love Story or English Patient you can make propaganda out of character like Patton or Lawrence of Arabia. The easiest and most common sorts of propaganda are flagwaving and hatemongering  what's found in state of the union addresses and election campaign ads. At its best propaganda can remind us of our values of our responsibilities of our mythologies and potentials and so it can be a great good. At its worst propaganda may contain any of the faults of any medium  it may be bland dull predictable. When it is these things it is not very persuasive and so it fails at its main intent.In this light Schindler's List is maybe the secondbest type of propaganda. It has real emotion a compelling story myriad technical virtues it leaves me with no choice but to agree with it but of course I agree with it already insofar as genocide is not a force for good. The movie moves me to an extent. But it lacks comedy the propagandist's most effective tool and so when it pretends to explore a range of humanity it tells a halftruth. Liam Neeson plays an excellent cad and Ralph Fiennes' raptor beak was never used to more terrifying effect. It is among the many faults of the Harry Potter movies that they cut off his nose. But I prefer The Pianist as a portrait of Nazioccupied Poland. Aside from possessing greater artistic powers than Spielberg Roman Polanski has an immensely deeper capacity for human truth. He does not preach and he is not strident and he is not sentimental. And he allows Adrien Brody to make me laugh occasionally not as often as he makes me cry but sometimes. Shakespeare's trick of contrasting tragedy with comedy is not simply effective storytelling it is a view to a more realized universe. Jaws has it. E.T. has it. But Spielberg apparently felt that to be funny about the Holocaust would be in bad taste. As far as propagandist filmmakers go I'll take Charlie Chaplin or Paul Verhoeven. They are at least funny the pill of Great Dictator or Starship Troopers goes down more easily more persuasively therefore more effectively than the pill of Schindler or Private Ryan.".

Liam's presentation is great fast and simple.What a way to use ellipses which are sometimes even fun like when a woman goes on the train.No matter how much you see it it will surprise you again.The photography is great even when we see the girl in red it may seem simple but I think it is not.The direction is the own one of someone who dominates to the perfection the visual narrative. He knows where to put the camera at every moment to tell a story. You do not have time to get bored. He knows when to make a slow plane. Know how to compose so that everything is where it should be and you can have everything in sight. Neither camera movement nor the plane nor the short between planes is free.I know it will be noticed that it is my favorite director but I can not help but surrender to someone who apart from being commercial is very good I compare it to a Mercedes or a BMW they will be commercial but they are good.SpoilerIt is impressive to see how the sequence in which the architect dies with a slight movement of camera characters and staging is putting everything in place to make you look where you should look. That if it is not going to prohibit you from looking anywhere everything to focus and everything telling you at once bring the woman on camera so you can see who is going to be killed while a German drinks a coffee total symbol of tranquility for enhance the moment more.

Yet it could have been so much more if the story just told simply and if the central theme were fully understood and developed.Before the war Schindler and his friend Goeth were boozy flirtatious German businessmen. Both would have likely been uninspired failures had there been no war. In a kinder world Goeth's and Schindler's moral differences might have manifested themselves in the size of the tip that they would leave the barmaid. In war the consequences of moral choices are greatly magnified resulting in Schindler becoming a most unlikely heroic figure and Goeth becoming a loathed prison commandant. In the film Spielberg elevates Schindler to sainthood status and portrays Goeth as a sadistic psychopath. By sanitizing Schindler's many faults boozing gambling womanizing... and by demonizing Goeth Spielberg severs our connection with them and ironically blunts the conflict between them. Adolf Eichmann was far more chilling than Charles Manson. Unlike Manson whom we could dismiss as psychotic Eichmann was the faceless functionary that we have all experienced whose defense of following orders is one that we have all heard a defense that was used by many during the war and one that we might see ourselves using under similar circumstances had we not Schindler's courage. By making Schindler a saint Spielberg diminishes both his accomplishment and his inspiration to us  saints have no problems making the right decision  the rest of us do. Rather than a gaping chasm there is but a fine moral line between Schindler and Goeth  one that we tread every day which fortunately for us rarely does more than determines a barmaid's salary.Spielberg does not develop this simple theme preferring to impress us with a grandiose view of a great moral tale. Instead he comes off as the underskilled souschef drowning a wonderful filet mignon in an overly rich sauce. The quality of the ingredients still shine through despite the clumsy handling but does not approach its great potential. In the end the best thing about the film is that it reminds Americans of a monstrous event in history. It is unfortunate that this reminder is necessary and that it reduces such a timeless parable to a useful public service announcement.".

	schema:reviewBody "Schindler's List did quite well at the box office while it guaranteed the maker his first Oscar for directing. Jane Campion edged him out for several of the yearend awards given by critics groups but the Academy put him at the top of their A list for this effort. 1993 was quite a year for Spielberg. JURASSIC PARK went goofy worldwide eclipsing yet another Spielberg megabuck effort E.T. Schindler's List may never quite reach the same boxoffice stratosphere but Spielberg can certainly be most pleased and proud of this film. Shot in glorious black and white it is the heartwrenching story of a group of Jews condemned to the Krakow Ghetto who are saved by a most unlikely guardian angel a German businessman named Oskar Schindler. Herr Schindler is at first only interested in these people as cheap labor that can further enhance his bank account but somewhere along the way he gains a measure of humanity and is soon taking substantial risks for his Jews. The movie isn't precisely clear about why this drastic character change takes place but that hardly matters. The inherent drama of the turbulent situation carries us along for the full three hours and you'll be hardpressed not to shed a few tears during the journey. Liam Neeson does a stalwart job of filling the Schindler shoes not skimping on the little character details while looming larger than life. It has been noted that Neeson has the presence of an oldfashioned movie star and as Schindler he shows that he knows what to do with it. The reallife Schindler was described as a cross between Curt Jurgens and George Sanders.Also quietly impressive is that Gandhi guy Ben Kingsley as Itzhak a very clever accountant who is the brains behind the Schindler empire. Newcomer Ralph Fiennes has also copped some Best Supporting Actor awards for his nasty Nazi Amon Goeth who heads up the Plaszow forced labor camp. When bored Goeth picks off unsuspecting prisoners with his rifle from the terrace of his villa. Chilling. The rest of the large cast has been carefully chosen the script is intelligent the music is sweeping and that cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is a knockout. The complaints about Schindler's List are mostly minor. At one point Spielberg feels compelled to use a specialeffects trick. It looks like a cheap cutandpaste job. Couldn't the man who made dinosaurs walk the earth so realistically pull off this relatively simple stunt? The protracted finale also got on my nerves. After the movie climaxes the director lets it drag on with a heartfelt but misplaced tribute to the actual survivors. Mr. Spielberg your manipulation is showing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had no expectations going into this movie.  I had heard different opinions about it and I was pleasantly blown away by it.  It left me in tears which few movies ever truly do.  I honestly believe this to be one of the top ten greatest films of all time...not necessarily because of it's watchability but because of it's content and the way it is filmed. Liam Neeson Who I have never been fond of plays Oskar Schindler a member of the Nazi Party who is a brilliant business man con artist and German personality.  He loves his ladies and his booze but is also quite humane right from the very beginning.  When the Germans invade Poland and begin to send Jews into Ghetto's he opens a factory making cookware pots and pans using the jews as labor.  However it isn't cruel labor but rather he is giving them a purpose and treats them as equal workers giving them benefits and good working conditions...to him...he's just making his money.  He is very humble about everything and does not see why the Jews are so happy with him.  As the movie continues we see the honest progression of the war and the hatred towards the Jews.  The rumours of the gas chamber begin to circulate and we watch as Almon Goeth played chillingly by Ralph Fiennes another actor I have never been overly fond of murders Jews at will keeping the other Jews in check by fear.  Goeth is a power hungry Nazi who thrives on seeing people suffer by his hand.  He's been given a high powered rank and milks it for all it's worth and enjoys it.  He snipers Jews from his window...just for sport.  He's empty and pure evil.  When Schindler happens to oversee a Ghetto raid by the SS he is moved to tears as he watches his workers being brutalized.  As he makes his millions he wields his own more subtle power with bribes women food wine reputation in order to progress his business and save his workers. He then takes a quite signifigant more direct role by actually buying off top ranking Nazi officials in order to buy Jewish workers...the workers and their families who worked for him in his cookware plant.  He begins to make a list of 1100 Jewish people he wants bought and brought by train to his new Munitions plant where they are to make shell casings for bombs.  A very intense scene takes place when the Jewish women he purchased are rerouted to the wrong place because of an error in paper work.  They think that this is it for them and the gas chamber will be their destination but the error is fixed and the women arrive unharmed to Schindler's Plant.  In the most moving scene in movie history...Schindler breaks down before escaping Allied forces at the end of the war and realizes how many had died outside his factory and how many he wished he could have saved.  Liam Neeson performance in this entire movie but especially in that scene will haunt me forever.  This film is never to be tossed on a back shelf...it is so much more than a classic...it's brilliance.  I don't however necessarily take it as historical fact when it comes to Schindler. In reading on him I don't see him quite as the beloved character you feel in the movie.  He seemed more selfish and perhaps less humble in real life...but nonetheless the man saved 1100 and then some Jews and that to me makes him a hero no matter what.  This movie though is one no one can ever miss.  It's a triumph!!! 1010".

He begins to make a list of 1100 Jewish people he wants bought and brought by train to his new Munitions plant where they are to make shell casings for bombs.  A very intense scene takes place when the Jewish women he purchased are rerouted to the wrong place because of an error in paper work.  They think that this is it for them and the gas chamber will be their destination but the error is fixed and the women arrive unharmed to Schindler's Plant.  In the most moving scene in movie history...Schindler breaks down before escaping Allied forces at the end of the war and realizes how many had died outside his factory and how many he wished he could have saved.  Liam Neeson performance in this entire movie but especially in that scene will haunt me forever.  This film is never to be tossed on a back shelf...it is so much more than a classic...it's brilliance.  I don't however necessarily take it as historical fact when it comes to Schindler. In reading on him I don't see him quite as the beloved character you feel in the movie.  He seemed more selfish and perhaps less humble in real life...but nonetheless the man saved 1100 and then some Jews and that to me makes him a hero no matter what.  This movie though is one no one can ever miss.  It's a triumph!!! 1010";

One can almost believe he was there in person and lived through those years in the 40's.Schindler's List works like magic on the screen.

This makes the viewers completely captivated on what's going on on the screen. It's almost as if we are being held in a state of believing we are in the movie ourselves. No other movie I've seen can I say have made me feel that way. Steven Spielberg finally got the reviews and critics he deserved for Schindler's List. He is truly the greatest Director of today.

	schema:headline " Arguably Steven Spielberg's greatest film ever.";
	schema:reviewBody "Steven Spielberg's epic portrayal of the Nazi Holocaust is one of the most powerful films ever brought to the big screen. During production Spielberg is said to have stood in the cold on location in Austria and cried being partly Jewish as he imagined the horrors that all of those people suffered during the second World War under the oppression of the Nazis. It is clear that at least some of this emotion transferred over into the film and the end result is startlingly effective and moving. Sure Spielberg has had several other films that have been amazing and memorable not the least of which obviously are ones like Saving Private Ryan and Amistad oh shut up Amistad rocked but in my opinion the shocking realism achieved in large part through the documentary style filmmaking gives Schindler's List the boost needed to surpass the also brutally realistic Saving Private Ryan.The story involves a Nazi who exercised his humanity and attempted to free as many Jews as possible from being killed in the concentration camps. Steven Spielberg has been often criticized for being overly sappy or emotional in his films this was of course long before Spielberg himself criticized Roberto Benigni's Life Is Beautiful for virtually the same thing and this may have happened in Schindler's List as well but in this case if he was sappy it was for good reason and with great effect. At the end of the film Liam Neeson's Oskar Schindler has saved a tremendous amount of people who would otherwise have died but he doesn't seem to notice this as he emotionally laments all of the possessions that he still has that could have been used to save peoples' lives. This is especially effective because of the fact that he was a much more materialistic opportunist at the beginning of the film before he began to pay attention to his conscience.As he did with Saving Private Ryan Spielberg creates a film with Schindler's List that is absolutely unflinching. He does not shy away from the horrific things that happened to the victims in the concentration camps and he does not sugarcoat his presentation of it at all. The time period is recreated and brought to the screen with stunning and disturbing realism and if it weren't for the quality of the presentation it could almost seem that we are watching stock footage of the concentration camps themselves rather than a scripted and edited film. Spielberg's emphasis on the emotional element of his films comes into play most powerfully in the closing scene of the film as a very long line of people  the descendents of those that he saved during the war  walk through a cemetery in the modern day and place flowers on his grave. Schindler was unsatisfied when the war ended because he felt that he could have and should have saved more people but during this scene it becomes abundantly clear that he really made a difference and that his accomplishments were important and longlasting. With Schindler's List Steven Spielberg once again demonstrates his tremendous skills as a filmmaker. 1993 is a testament to Spielberg's filmmaking skills because this was the year that he directed Schindler's List the Best Picture of the year as well as Jurassic Park which was the most popular film of the year. These two films are a perfect example of the two main types of films that Spielberg is so adept at creating. There are the fun and exciting films like Jurassic Park E.T. Hook the Indiana Jones films and the more recent A.I. Artificial Intelligence and then there are the films that are historically accurate and are made to deliver powerful messages to the world in reference to the events portrayed in the film such as Amistad Saving Private Ryan and probably his most powerful yet Schindler's List.".

	schema:reviewBody "How people can call this movie 'horrible' or rate it with 1 star is really beyond me. If ever a movie has captured the cruelty and inhumanity of the holocaust this is it. Horrifying scenes such as a woman being shot to death for construction mistakes that weren't her fault a man taken out to be killed but the gun won't fire and has to hear the officer try to see what the problem is so that he can shoot. And so many many more scenes that will stay in your mind for a long long time.I didn't cry in this movie. I haven't cried in a movie since I was a kid. But this movie had a huge impact on me that when I went to sleep the night I saw this movie the images kept rolling in my mind quite like the impact the botched execution scene in The Green Mile had on me.I saw a review before me a few pages back which said that Israeli people are probably the most aware about the Holocaust. But I don't believe that's true. At least not to the younger generation. One of the huge mistake people make including many many Israelis is that the Holocaust was only against Jews. I personally find it a disgrace that the Holocaust Memorial Day in Israel and the famed Holocaust Museum in Israel Yad Va Shem refer only to the figure 6000000. When over 11000000 people fell victim to the crimes of the Nazis. But hey I'm rambling here. I think this movie definitely captures the torture that the Holocaust victims had to go through.The movie is in black and white with only one girl in a red dress who is shown trying to save her life from the Nazis by hiding under a bed. We later see this same girl's body taken to be burned showing us that she obviously didn't survive. That got to me most. I don't think much of Steven Spielberg as a person. In fact I don't even think that much of him as a director but he did a magnificent job on this movie. I'm sure that it will become one of the most well remembered movies of all time. People know the figures the numbers the years but to see it for yourself just makes you feel so happy that you were not a JewGypsyBlackHomosexualDeformedHandicapedLeftHandedCommunist etc. at that time. I think everyone should see this movie.Although I think it is the most powerful movie ever made and deserves the number one spot on the IMDb top 250 over The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption it's not a movie I would see multiple times. Perhaps once a year when it's shown on Holocaust Memorial Day and even that can be to much. It's the type of movie that it's enough to see once and sticks in your mind. 1010.".

When over 11000000 people fell victim to the crimes of the Nazis. But hey I'm rambling here. I think this movie definitely captures the torture that the Holocaust victims had to go through.The movie is in black and white with only one girl in a red dress who is shown trying to save her life from the Nazis by hiding under a bed. We later see this same girl's body taken to be burned showing us that she obviously didn't survive. That got to me most. I don't think much of Steven Spielberg as a person. In fact I don't even think that much of him as a director but he did a magnificent job on this movie. I'm sure that it will become one of the most well remembered movies of all time. People know the figures the numbers the years but to see it for yourself just makes you feel so happy that you were not a JewGypsyBlackHomosexualDeformedHandicapedLeftHandedCommunist etc. at that time. I think everyone should see this movie.Although I think it is the most powerful movie ever made and deserves the number one spot on the IMDb top 250 over The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption it's not a movie I would see multiple times. Perhaps once a year when it's shown on Holocaust Memorial Day and even that can be to much. It's the type of movie that it's enough to see once and sticks in your mind. 1010.";

Following his more human' dramas such as The Color Purple and Empire of the Sun the project was still very much in his mind but his own involvement would be purely on a production level.

If JP was the sort of a movie an overexcited child would make then SL was that of a seasoned filmmaker at ease with his craft and intent on delivering something extremely adult.Schindler's List received 12 Oscar nominations including the elusive Best Director gong which Steven eventually picked up from an Academy that had ignored many of his movies on the grounds that he had been rewarded enough.Tackling a drama in which six million people ended up dead was not for the novice filmmaker  It was for the brave of heart and a director that could tell such a stark tale without alienating his audience from the outset.Indeed only Claude Lanzmann had delivered anything that came close with his epic film Shoah a nine and a half hour documentary about the Holocaust which wowed the critics in 1985.For his movie Spielberg was blessed with a polished screenplay by Steve Zaillian a young writer who went on to direct his own movies such as the John Travolta vehicle A Civil Action and who has just spruced up the dialogue for Silence of the Lambs sequel Hannibal.Needless to say this not the sort of movie you curl up with on a Saturday night with a box of chocs and a six pack.

Sitting here long after in the aftermath I might never forgive myself for missing that opportunity. Eventually I did get around to see it though a small TV never does a film the same justice a theater does and being a bit sceptic about the small hype this movie caused made me prejudice about it but I must say I have never been so wrong before. And I am happy saying it.This movies biggest crime and yet its biggest asset is that it is in French. Subtitles just does not bring full justice to a movie like this and it is bound to scare off most of the audience not used to subtitled movies. Sad to say so but I believe it is the truth. I do not know any French at all but I sure wish I was fluent watching this movie!Compared to most other films Amelie and I will stick to Amelie since Le Fabuleux destin d'Amlie Poulain is a bit long to write is based on a rather ordinary and plain story everyone can relate to but it is given to us in a very special kind of way mixed with wonderful little subplots and an almost chaotic amount of details. We get to see and experience the world and especially Paris through the filtering eyes and fantasy of Amelie A Paris that might feel small and limited on the screen but in fact is just as big as it is in the eyes of Amelie.Director JeanPierre Jeunet brings to life the world of Amelie with colors masterful camerawork and a few special effects Well I have certainly felt like melting a couple of times too in my life!. Some people I spoke to before seeing Amelie criticized it for being too childish and unrealistic but I believe it is an essential part of the movie since Amelie herself is a very childish and imaginative young girl. She just happens to fall in love one day when she decides to embark on a quest. JeanPierre Jeunet manages to bring us along without losing control of the set or the plot. It is exactly this kind of movie that could easily be overdone and lose all of its magic in the hands of the wrong person but JeanPierre Jeunet never slips a single time. For you who think you never heard of him before he is actually the same man who brought us Alien 4 back in 1997 I still refuse to believe he was involved in that horrible film... and the wonderful Delicatessen in 1991.Audrey Tautou could not be overemphasized for her importance in portraying Amelie. I am a bit embarrassed admitting it but I was almost falling in love with Amelie myself forgetting she was only fiction on the screen. However she does not carry Amelie solely by herself. The cast makes an excellent whole and it is hard imagining switching anyone without affecting the whole outcome. Everyone manages to make the most out of their role and even though we only get to know some of them briefly they come alive just as much as Amelie herself does.I could go on forever about Amelie. It contains so many details and switches in tempo and camerawork it has to be seen more than once to take in and understand everything. Damn it Amelie made me happy laughing out loud at times and very few movies affects me like that.I very rarely give movies a 10 and I was indeed considering a 9 for a while but for me this is one of those movies I will come back to time after time. Long after the CG thrills of hyped fantasy movies and big budget Hollywood productions have faded and been forgotten Amelie will still be jumping around in my heart doing all those silly and charming little things I wish I dared to do too...".

	schema:headline " It's my favorite movie of all time...";
	schema:reviewBody "Short analysis on JeanPierre Jeunet's Le fabuleux destin d'Amlie PoulainFor 20 years JeanPierre Jeunet collected small astonishing and intriguing moments in his life taking notes in his diary not knowing that he was up to cowrite and direct one of the most successful film in French film history. JeanPierre Jeunet fell in love with the story and the film he titled Le fabuleux destin d'Amlie Poulain. But it's popularity was even a surprise to JeanPierre Jeunet himself as he once stated I guess I have to produce a film like Alien Resurrection USA 1997 to make a movie like Le fabuleux destin d'Amlie Poulain' obviously not aware of the films potential. Unfortunately the film didn't win an Academy Award for the best foreign film in 2001 which still puzzles film fans all over the world.I consider JeanPierre Jeunet's film as a masterpiece. In my opinion it is an outstanding film in film history for its cinematography the music the story but above all the overall atmosphere. Going to the cinema is like meditating. We sit for over onehour and comfortable chair  our breath slows down and as the lights are switched off we enter a dream world. We seek to escape our normal world just for a short period of time to experience something totally different and yet we want to find ourselves in this world. Thanks to JeanPierre Jeunet I had a wonderful dream I will never forget.JeanPierre Jeunet and his camera man Bruno Delbonnel wanted to make the film look like the Spanish painter did his artwork. To establish a dreamlike atmosphere they used mostly red and green sometimes adding a little blue spot in the picture to set the contrast. Audrey Tautou Amlie Poulain mostly wears either red or green dresses as well as the housekeeper Yolande Moreau as Madelaine Wallace concierge and Amlie's mother Lorella Cravotta as Amandine Poulin in the beginning of the film. When Amlie Poulain sits down to watch the tragedy of her life on her TV there is an outstanding of a blue lamp in the background. Sometimes the use of color gets very obvious. Amlie's apartment for example is almost completely red the underground station and the train station are kept in green and the green grocery store stands out from the grey buildings. Honestly I haven't noticed the extreme use of color the first time I watched the movie. I just wondered how Jeunet succeeded in establishing such a fabulous atmosphere.The atmosphere is also supported by the magnificent music by Yann Tiersen who has composed 19 songs in 15 days for this movie. The principal motive appears in many variations somehow being joyful yet at the same time sad  slow and sometimes fast and activating. The music supports every moment in the film and becomes the sound of a fabulous world.Camera movement certainly contributes its part to the atmosphere. Balanced and unbalanced pictures contribute to the message of each shot. Right in the beginning when Amlie's mother is introduced the picture is balanced symbolizing her pursuit for correctness and cleanliness. The same can be about the first shots of Amlie's father. When talking about his dislikes the shots are unbalanced. But more impressing are some camera movements. For example there is an astonishing high angle shot of Amlie flipping stones on le canal in Paris. The camera shows her leaning on a fence flying above her head then craning to a low angle shot to show her flipping stones in the direction of the camera. Another one worth mentioning might be the chase of the repairs person. Nino is shown falling up the steps chasing the repairs person for the photo machines. The camera turns to show the man getting in the car driving off. Still in a low angle Nino starts his moped trying to follow the worker almost hitting a car. Amlie is entering the picture running after Nino. The camera follows her then turning almost 180 around her to show her hold Nino's red bag that he lost. When Amlie sits in front of the station we see her in a long shot the camera dollies in to fly over her head to an overtheshoulder shot. Some of these camera movements are really awesome not only from a technical point of view but moreover from an aesthetic standpoint. They support the dreamlike atmosphere adding interesting aspects to ordinary actions.Audrey Tautou at the age of 23 is an astonishing actress. I really can't imagine anybody doing the job better than she did. To me she is not only giving life to the character she lives it. It's wonderful to watch her. There was no moment when I had the faintest impression that there is something wrong or inappropriate in her acting. Also Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix is extraordinarily gifted with his talent. Most of the actors have done a wonderful job although I want to mention the scene when Amlie's mother gets her nervous breakdown because of the suicidal fish. This scene appeared to me exaggerated which it probably was intended to be. Anyhow the extreme closeup of Yolande Moreau was to intriguing to me so I shrug back in disgust rather than laughing about it. I gues this was the director's choice so I don't hold her responsible for that.Another negative and distracting thing where some scenes when JeanPierre Jeunet decided to show the key in Amlie's pocket after copying it and bringing the original key back to the grocer's door in a very unrealistic way. He uses a digital effet showing the key's silhouette in a yellow light. This is a technique that hasn't been used very often in the film except for showing Amlie's heart going faster and the old blind man feeling very happy after being guided by Amlie. All these scenes disturb the otherwise wonderful cinematography. There could have been other ways to communicate the actions. A simple smile on the old's man face a closeup of Amlie's hand letting the copied key slide into her pocket and the heart beat as a background sound would have done the same without disturbing the atmosphere.Anyway Le fabuleux destin d'Amlie Poulain is still my favorite movie. The narration is perfectly arranged taking its time to tell every detail. I enjoyed the subplots a lot that are told in a subtle way. Maybe the introduction is a bit to long but still I enjoyed every second. Maybe I am too used to typical Hollywood productions where you can tell the stages of a story by watching the clock. Le fabuleux destin d'Amlie Poulain has its own rhythm driving the story forward not by a superhero trying to achieve his goal but by a hero that knows that she has time to arrange everything by strategic means. Maybe that is also one reason why I like this film so much. The story is told with time and not against time. There is no last minuterescue no time pressure no need to act. It just takes its time as life does.In my opinion JeanPierre Jeunet created a masterpiece. A film that is not only outstanding because of the cinematography the special effects or any other technical characteristics but also combines the perfection of craftsmanship with a wonderful story humour and emotion.".

	onyx:emotionText "Short analysis on JeanPierre Jeunet's Le fabuleux destin d'Amlie PoulainFor 20 years JeanPierre Jeunet collected small astonishing and intriguing moments in his life taking notes in his diary not knowing that he was up to cowrite and direct one of the most successful film in French film history. JeanPierre Jeunet fell in love with the story and the film he titled Le fabuleux destin d'Amlie Poulain. But it's popularity was even a surprise to JeanPierre Jeunet himself as he once stated I guess I have to produce a film like Alien Resurrection USA 1997 to make a movie like Le fabuleux destin d'Amlie Poulain' obviously not aware of the films potential. Unfortunately the film didn't win an Academy Award for the best foreign film in 2001 which still puzzles film fans all over the world.I consider JeanPierre Jeunet's film as a masterpiece. In my opinion it is an outstanding film in film history for its cinematography the music the story but above all the overall atmosphere. Going to the cinema is like meditating. We sit for over onehour and comfortable chair  our breath slows down and as the lights are switched off we enter a dream world. We seek to escape our normal world just for a short period of time to experience something totally different and yet we want to find ourselves in this world. Thanks to JeanPierre Jeunet I had a wonderful dream I will never forget.JeanPierre Jeunet and his camera man Bruno Delbonnel wanted to make the film look like the Spanish painter did his artwork. To establish a dreamlike atmosphere they used mostly red and green sometimes adding a little blue spot in the picture to set the contrast. Audrey Tautou Amlie Poulain mostly wears either red or green dresses as well as the housekeeper Yolande Moreau as Madelaine Wallace concierge and Amlie's mother Lorella Cravotta as Amandine Poulin in the beginning of the film. When Amlie Poulain sits down to watch the tragedy of her life on her TV there is an outstanding of a blue lamp in the background. Sometimes the use of color gets very obvious. Amlie's apartment for example is almost completely red the underground station and the train station are kept in green and the green grocery store stands out from the grey buildings. Honestly I haven't noticed the extreme use of color the first time I watched the movie. I just wondered how Jeunet succeeded in establishing such a fabulous atmosphere.The atmosphere is also supported by the magnificent music by Yann Tiersen who has composed 19 songs in 15 days for this movie. The principal motive appears in many variations somehow being joyful yet at the same time sad  slow and sometimes fast and activating. The music supports every moment in the film and becomes the sound of a fabulous world.Camera movement certainly contributes its part to the atmosphere. Balanced and unbalanced pictures contribute to the message of each shot. Right in the beginning when Amlie's mother is introduced the picture is balanced symbolizing her pursuit for correctness and cleanliness. The same can be about the first shots of Amlie's father. When talking about his dislikes the shots are unbalanced. But more impressing are some camera movements. For example there is an astonishing high angle shot of Amlie flipping stones on le canal in Paris. The camera shows her leaning on a fence flying above her head then craning to a low angle shot to show her flipping stones in the direction of the camera. Another one worth mentioning might be the chase of the repairs person. Nino is shown falling up the steps chasing the repairs person for the photo machines. The camera turns to show the man getting in the car driving off. Still in a low angle Nino starts his moped trying to follow the worker almost hitting a car. Amlie is entering the picture running after Nino. The camera follows her then turning almost 180 around her to show her hold Nino's red bag that he lost. When Amlie sits in front of the station we see her in a long shot the camera dollies in to fly over her head to an overtheshoulder shot. Some of these camera movements are really awesome not only from a technical point of view but moreover from an aesthetic standpoint. They support the dreamlike atmosphere adding interesting aspects to ordinary actions.Audrey Tautou at the age of 23 is an astonishing actress. I really can't imagine anybody doing the job better than she did. To me she is not only giving life to the character she lives it. It's wonderful to watch her. There was no moment when I had the faintest impression that there is something wrong or inappropriate in her acting. Also Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix is extraordinarily gifted with his talent. Most of the actors have done a wonderful job although I want to mention the scene when Amlie's mother gets her nervous breakdown because of the suicidal fish. This scene appeared to me exaggerated which it probably was intended to be. Anyhow the extreme closeup of Yolande Moreau was to intriguing to me so I shrug back in disgust rather than laughing about it.

	schema:reviewBody "Amelie is a film that struck a certain chord with me. Every now and then movies come along that speak out to you and emotionally touch you in some way. Amelie is one such film for me. I related to its innocent charm and delightfully shy protagonist played by French sensation Audrey Tautou the way very few films have. Part of the reason we watch movies is to learn something about ourselves or recognize characters that are remarkably similar to us and the way we are in real life. For all of us shy introverted quirky and oddball eccentrics out there who have trouble relating to normal people Audrey Tautou in this film is our personal hero. Instead of going into much detail about why the film works I'll instead try to explain what it meant to me personally. Sure I guess this means I have to open up maybe more than I'd like to about myself but oh well. The way Amelie's childhood was presented is similar to my own. I am an only child to divorced parents and very rarely had friends as I was and still am very much a loner. As a child much of my time was spent alone so I entertained myself in all kinds of silly ways. Just like Amelie does in the film. Of course I gained my fixation with films at an extremely early age but also did stupid things like give my stuffed animals personalities and have conversations with them draw pictures and create stories to go along with them and laid in bed listening to the radio with the windows open on a lazy summer day imagining creatures out of the cloud formations. Apparently there are legions of us out there. Even today I enjoy solitude far more than the company of most people and still use my imagination to think of stupid little things. Amelie did an amazing job in capturing what the world is like through the eyes of a person who doesn't really fit in but finds joy in the simple things in life. Like the fresh spring breeze on your face the sound of the rain the chirping of birds the touch of fur and popping bubble wrap. Actually popping bubble wrap was always an exciting and rare treat during my youth. JeanPierre Jeunet's film also has a marvelously fun nifty view of sex. For Amelie sex is not something that is intimidating temptingly desirable sinful adult or lustful. It's just another of the many silly things that people do in this world that make us human. Two people taking off their cloths and rubbing up against one another. How sweet! In fact many people have insulted the film for it's unique view and open attitude towards sex. For shame really. Sure there's a lot of it actually. Amelie's first sexual encounter the orgasms the object of her affection working in a porn shop with a stripper and putting price tags on didoes. But it's all in good fun and filmed with the naivety that a character like Amelie would view sex as. Anyways the movie really works. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel does an excellent job in filming Jeunet's crazy vision and Audrey Tautou with her funky hairdo wide brown eyes and whimsical voice and kitten like mannerisms and shyness brings the movie to life. As I said I relate to this movie and understand the character the way I do with few other movies simply because it is frighteningly very much like I tend to be in real life. You mean she would rather imagine herself relating to an absent person than build relationships with those around her?Hmm so would I sometimes. Audrey Tautou's been a more reliable friend than most people and has put a smile on my face and lightened my day at the thought of her more times than one. And I still say I'll marry her one day.".

	schema:headline " Amelie innocently skips stones in the canal and you realize that this deserves all the hype";
	schema:reviewBody "Waiting for Amelie' to begin in a theater fraught with noisy college students drinking cheap beer I wasn't expecting anything more than an overhyped flick from our friends in France.  I slowly began to realize as I watched Amelie skip stones in the canal that for the very first time a film deserved all of hype it had been accorded and more and I felt so blessed to be a part of this revelation.Possible SpoilersIt's hard to put into words how much I loved Amelie.'  I felt as though I were sitting next to Monet watching as he effortlessly splashed brilliant watercolors across his canvas.  I had this strange but fantastic feeling of being inside the mind of Amelie seeing everything in the vibrant colors she viewed life with and wanting to remain there much longer than the two hours allotted.  It was just so refreshing to watch a movie where your imagination was free to soar rather than feel confused by the apparent deja vu from last year's first installment of the same pointless drivel.I almost always loathe films with subtitles as I feel that they get in the way of viewing the characters actions and facial expressions.  Amelie' is the first film where I adored the subtitles and in fact had a nagging urge to go out and learn French that is still with me today.  Much of this can be attributed to the delightful Audrey Tatou.  Her expressive eyes and sweet caring nature provided the viewer with fond memories of Audrey Hepburn and prevented me from being distracted by the subtitles.  Could a 23 year old actress with little experience be just as fantastic as Meryl Streep and Katharine Hepburn?  I really wasn't expecting it but Audrey Tatou revitalized my interest in film and left me wondering why her name didn't appear on Academy ballots and what possessed the Academy to favor No Man's Land.'An already perfect film couldn't get much better but along with the lovingly created cinematography and delight of rising star Tatou came the wonderful story of a true dogooder.  Amelie' is a film that begs  you to get happy and should give some shortterm contentment to even the most depressed of individuals.  Little moments like the tragically funny early years of Amelie are very special and the best I've seen on the silver screen.  The scene where Amelie is skipping stones in the canal should be studied for years to come as the greatest technical moment in cinema.Movies like this one don't come around very often.  Perhaps the creators of films that pander to dumbeddown audiences who apparently can't tell that their watching last year's film should take the hint.  The moviegoing public wants to be inspired and wants to be provided with the same imagination they have when reading a great novel. This is why Amelie' remains 18 on the list of best films.1010".

	onyx:emotionText "Waiting for Amelie' to begin in a theater fraught with noisy college students drinking cheap beer I wasn't expecting anything more than an overhyped flick from our friends in France.  I slowly began to realize as I watched Amelie skip stones in the canal that for the very first time a film deserved all of hype it had been accorded and more and I felt so blessed to be a part of this revelation.Possible SpoilersIt's hard to put into words how much I loved Amelie.'  I felt as though I were sitting next to Monet watching as he effortlessly splashed brilliant watercolors across his canvas.  I had this strange but fantastic feeling of being inside the mind of Amelie seeing everything in the vibrant colors she viewed life with and wanting to remain there much longer than the two hours allotted.  It was just so refreshing to watch a movie where your imagination was free to soar rather than feel confused by the apparent deja vu from last year's first installment of the same pointless drivel.I almost always loathe films with subtitles as I feel that they get in the way of viewing the characters actions and facial expressions.  Amelie' is the first film where I adored the subtitles and in fact had a nagging urge to go out and learn French that is still with me today.  Much of this can be attributed to the delightful Audrey Tatou.  Her expressive eyes and sweet caring nature provided the viewer with fond memories of Audrey Hepburn and prevented me from being distracted by the subtitles.

Especially the way Jackie Gleason walked the way he was dressed the way he spoke he wasn't trying to be cool he simply was.On a minorly related note Amelie is a film that wants to be quirky it wants to be cutesy but it fails because it tries too hard The exaggerated camera movements and sound effects the ultraluminous yet rather nice cinematography designed to turn Paris into a fantasy world the odd quips of dialogue on orgasms but the absolute biggest fault of the film is with the lead character known as Amelie.Amelie is a womanchild who likes to take it upon herself to do selfless good deeds for everyone around her and the entire storyline revolves around her attempts to fix various problems for everyone within her vicinity. The only problem is that Amelie's selflessness isn't real she's only doing this to feed her own sense of accomplishment so she can crack that godawful smile at the camera once that good deed is done. Not long after it becomes extremely apparent that she's a psychopath who breaks into other people's appartments to screw with them because she not the police or any authorities must be the one to deal with bad people appoints herself as an unneeded tour guide for a blind man and basically does whatever she wants regardless of whether it actually helps anyone.The film has clearly taken cues from the French New Wave Amelie even watches Jules Et Jim at the Cinema but it has taken those editing and storytelling tricks to the nth degree and spoiled the entire film even Amelie is taken from Irene Jacob's character in Three Colours Red and made even nicer and sweeter until she's just plain obnoxious It's an unbearably naive film that's filled with so much sugary fake charm that it becomes sickening rather quickly and once the cutesy novelty wears off you realise that there's just no substance to the storyline at all. Some people have been enchanted by the magical qualities of it but I was completely put off as the whole thing was overthetop and rather selfindulgent. A film like L'Atalante finds the poetic beauty in the banality of life and simply displays it in all of its ordinary glory. Amelie constantly forces you to accept its own childish and fauxmagical view of the world some people can accept it but I can't.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rating 12 out of What a fun film! From the moment it begins Amelie bursts with joy and energy. It's a fable of sorts a love letter to a Paris fondly dreamt of by many. It may not be the real world but it is such a delightful fantasy that it doesn't matter how unbelievable some of it may be. Amelie is the rare romantic comedy that has both the romance and the comedy. It isn't very surprising that this has been a hit in France for a while now and I have no doubt it will find the audience it needs in the States as well.Amelie Poulain Audrey Tautou is a nave girl working at the Two Windmills Caf. When she was a child her mother and teacher was an innocent victim of a suicide gone awry. Amelie stayed with her father until she was old enough to leave and lead a life of her own. One day she finds a small box of treasures behind a tile in her wall she decides to return it to her owner and become a natural dogooder. Later on she catches a man groping for lost photos under a photo booth Nino Quincampoix played by Mathieu Kassovitz and it's love at first sight. She decides to go on a quest to find this man and help anyone she can along the way including her father and coworkers.I said before that this film was a love letter to Paris it is also a love letter to Amelie herself. JeanPierre Jeunet director and coscreenwriter conjured the film like a dream as if Amelie is his dream girl and he is trying to save her and bring her to a happy ending. It's not hard to want everything to work out for her and her friends. Amelie Poulain is the kind of person who you wish was your best friend your neighbor or your sister. She bounces along with good grace and whimsy living life to its fullest yet keeping a mischievous grin. She has her own idea of justice that isn't very disagreeable. The tormentors must in turn be tormented the lifeless must be brought to life. The film is like a nonmusical Bells Are Ringing with our heroine bringing so much life to those around her but neglecting her wants and needs.After seeing Audrey Tautou as Amelie I can't possibly imagine anyone else in that role. She embodies Amelie like no one else could she is a rare find that pulls off the job of breathing life into Amelie in spades. Wait I take that back. She does not just breathe life into Amelie Tautou makes her jump off the screen and pull the audience into the story. It would be a crime for her not to get a Best Actress nomination for her role.Magical is the world that Amelie lives in where photos and lamps come alive to aid her quest where TV shows are showing nothing but her story. The story this setting surrounds is pretty standard and presented plainly could have just been another machineprocessed romantic comedy. Is it too sappy? No. On the contrary the film takes quite a few steps to make sure it doesn't become tacky or conventional. The rich storybook setting and a witty screenplay asides are taken to deepen our connection each character little things that each likes and dislikes make the film all the more a delight to watch. The cinematography crafted by Bruno Delbonnel does wonders for Amelie. The camera captures the action with an eye of a child in a candy store beautifully bringing about each shot as a new discovery.With films like The Widow of SaintPierre With a Friend Like Harry and boxoffice hit Brotherhood of the Wold French cinema has had quite a year. It's a delight that we round off the year with Amelie a fresh funny journey that could have easily just been more Meg Ryanesque romantic comedy fodder. If not for anything else see it for Tautou's performance but prepare to be smothered in a dream world.".

I felt miserable and angry because I had lost so many time on this movie. everything Amelie did ennoyed me and the reactions of the people ennoyed me even more they should have reacted like WTF go away are you sick in the head or what? Conclusion if she would have died a terrible death with nobody who cared about her at the and of the movie it would have cheered me up. the only positive thing about this film is that it is spoken in french nothing more ennoying than French people talking English in Paris. Another thing why does she look Chineze? the family Poulin is just a bunch of marginal people who have no friends. and the way they react they are just little children who will never be able to get a good job and earn money. and if Amelie wanted to try to step out of this marginality and start acting normal then it would be a good movie now it sucked because it is much to unrealistic.

It is the stuff of legend around high schools across the country. His name is Han Su and he remains unbeaten throughout the school system. Whoever tries to fight him not only faces the indignity of losing but is left with HanSu's trademark 7cm scar to remind them of their loss. When innocent new kid Han Su starts at Seong Ji High School he is instantly mistaken for the Seven Cutter. He is blissfully unaware of why the other students are giving him such an icy reception and so when the toughest boy at Seong Ji challenges Han Su to a fight he has no choice but defend himself. And when he accidentally wins things start getting really confusing for Han Su. The plot is ordinary and it has some nice moments that provides enjoyable entertainment. Acting is average and plot is ordinary. Another reason to see this film is to see Yoon Eun Hye in her screen debut if you happen to be a fan of hers.".

A tall tower was built on Hokkaido which could even be seen from Tokyo. In the summer of 1996 three middleschool students make a promise that they'll cross the border with a selfconstructed plane and unravel the tower's secret but their project was abandoned after the girl Sayuri Sawatari became mysteriously ill and transferred to Tokyo. Years later on the brink of another war Hiroki Fujisawa finds out that Sayuri had been in coma since then and he asks Takuya Shirakawa to help him finding a way to wake her up.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is an anime movie done by a relative newcomer to films Makoto Shinkai whose only previous directorial work was a halfhour short called Voices of a Distant Star in which he did all the animation himself on one laptop even for Japan a nation of workaholics that was unheard of. It made him so famous that they gave him a full studio to work with for his next project and when Makoto Shinkai doesn't have the constraints that a solo project would bring look out.The style of the film and its scifi and fantasy themes is equal parts steampunk and cyberpunk with the film taking place in an alternate timeline of postwar Japan only a few years from now. The main differences are the division between the North and South sides of Japan and the research into parallel universes that has sprung up resulting in the construction of a massive tower in Ezo Hokkaido which understandably captures the imagination and curiosity of the surrounding world.Though the film is ostensibly a science fiction work the plot involving a tower and alternate realities and so on plays second fiddle to the romantic drama about three high school kids torn apart by war. The emotions blend with the fantasy elemts in a way that is handled with incredible elegance care and sensitivity and Makoto Shinkai's trademark poetic touch.But what is more impressive is how the film shows that drama can be achieved through implausible situations. You see too many directors think that in order to make a film dramatic and touching it must be about REALISTIC people in a REALISTIC setting having REALISTIC problems with REALISTIC resolutions but Makoto Shinkai realizes a way around that and uses a science fiction element not as a platform for action sequences but rather as a way to achieve a kind of drama that you really couldn't get in a film that takes place in the real world.The film is aware that the scifi is playing second fiddle to the character drama and doesn't waste any more time than it needs to trying to explain the film's bizarre sciences or justify the contrivances rather leaving it up to the viewer to interpret and decipher what the fantasies of the film mean or symbolize. In other words Shinkai wisely avoids the deathtrap of Movie Science and instead allows the audience to take things as they come and explain them ourselves.The part about two teenagers building a plane that could get past a governmentbuilt radar system does seem a bit incredible but this film does reflect on the incompetence of governments and how easy it is to get past them so the required suspension of disbelief isn't really that big I wish I found it hard to believe that a couple of teenagers could get past a bureaucratic governmental system in this day and age at all.Also the brief violence and thrilling assault on the tower are treated with perfect sincerity. The brief fight scenes are breathtaking in their realism and how they show that when someone gets punched they get hurt. There are no legendary martial arts techniques or complex laserrifle technology here this film is about how people feel about each other and what they do when they are in trouble.The ending is slightly abrupt and somewhat openended although it is happy but that is a theme in many anime. A lot is left up to the audience's interpretation and imagination and the film only answers the questions that really matter.".

It is as visually captivating as Voices contains beautiful music and is longer and more complex.The plot which twists and turns considerably follows three high school kids through a period of war. There is a giant tower visible from where they live a huge white structure that reaches up through the clouds. They all long to go to the tower one day. Over several years they build a plane to fly to the tower but certain complications prevent them from making their flight. The plot becomes slightly confusing in the middle as it involves talk of parallel universes. But the movie ends triumphantly with the three friends separated for years meeting again to fly to the tower. But for reasons I will not reveal their flight will have a deeper impact than they thought.Overall the movie is beautiful. It is a joy to look at. Every scene from the lighting to the vivid colors captures a certain place and mood perfectly. The animation alternates between standard anime and fluid computergenerated eye candy. At times the film feels like a play with characters delivering heartfelt soliloquies that evoke feelings of loneliness and sorrow. Many of the emotions in Voices of a Distant Star are carried over to The Place Promised to Us In Our Early Days. But here with many characters and a longer more involved plot the emotions resonate more deeply.Though Makoto Shinkai's style is different from most of today's anime directors the quality of his work is comparable to Hayao Miyazaki.".

There are no highs or lows no real climax to the film and the ending is weak.I am a fan of anime and very much enjoy artistic anime. I don't need giant robot battles in order to enjoy a film and enjoy many aspects of the drama genre where story is as important as the animation itself. But this work struck me as mediocre in all aspects. I do appreciate that some may enjoy the verysubdued romantic aspect but I found it as undeveloped and uneventful as the rest of the work.As would be expected I give it 5 stars.

	schema:reviewBody "Makoto Shinkai came back. And this time he is not alone.'The Place Promised in Our Early Days' is a pure and beautiful piece of work. This has probably the most beautiful visuals of all animations that I've seen 'Please Save My Earth' and some others are also beautiful but they all have different characteristics I must say. Pictures themselves are beautiful and it is no wonder how people call him the 'magician of light'.My overall impression of this anime is that it's like a poet but with SciFi to match with it. 'Voices of a Distant Star Hoshi no koe' was quite boring for me honestly. But with a similar structure and image 'The Place...' seems to deliver much better what Makoto Shinkai wanted to deliver even though its story is slightly loose here and there.I do think however that it is 'too' consistent throughout  from Makoto Shinkai's authentic poetic and solitary pure atmosphere to its storydrama visuals e.g. lighting music etc I must say that sound aspects outside music is not very well done but let's put that aside pretty much everything. This strengthens the sense of purity this anime represents but I really think it would be better to have more 'bandwidth' to it so it can have more dynamics and life in it. It is great how Makoto Shinkai pulled it off gracefully knitted altogether though. I'd say that 'The Place...' stands on its very own ground really. I think it is something that's quite different to all the rest and don't really think it's appropriate to judge this by typical standards.To hold it together for a much longer period of time and to do it well he has effectively implied editing if I could say that and careful laying out of the story. But the biggest difference I witnessed from 'The Place...' was how Makoto Shinkai has casted much more characters than before  though characters lack in variety as well. This enriches the story as well as adding complexity and depth to it so you don't get bored out easily.But after all it is superb how well Makoto Shinkai has put the whole thing together so well. I was very fascinated and captured while I was watching it  which didn't happen for quite some time. I think this is one piece of work that overwhelms viewers by its beauty and sense of purity.P.S. Although I can understand how some animatings are not up to the feature animation quality I personally think it'd be better for Makoto Shinkai to get somebody good to retouch on his characters' faces.".

The score is haunting. The visuals and animation are stunning and the characters are charmingly awkward. Although there are some action sequences and a pint of blood thrown in for measure the film's pace is decidedly that of a romantic reflection on loneliness and bittersweet affection. In the end the story telling is adequate but viewers who were eager to be exposed to fantastic alternate universes will be disappointed.".

I think I feel some nostalgic connection to it somehow I appreciate how brilliant the boys are actually building something like that.. successfully.. while being so young. I guess I've always wanted to accomplish something like that. I also like the attention to technical detail like soldering and UNIX command lines. Even if you aren't into the story or the characters watch it for the animation. Some of the most beautiful scenes I think I may ever see. Especially for those you who tend to like sunsets. I can hardly think of anything I don't enjoy about it some people have said it doesn't feel tight or whole or well put together but I think the pacing really isn't that bad only thing that bothers me slightly is all the fades to black that are used for scene transitions but really I'm not sure what else would have been better it makes it a whole lot less confusing than just cutting to scenes and having to figure out whats going on and if its a different place or time. The DVD release is decent some good interviews motoko shinkai seems like a real nice guy video quality is good audio is fine dont know about the English voice actors id be afraid to really watch it in English. its good.".

	schema:headline " A little disappointing but beautiful nonetheless";
	schema:reviewBody "Makoto Shinkai is unique in his directing style in that he often places more focus on a character's inner thoughts rather than his or her dialogue and interacting with the environment. While this style has its own set of strengths and weaknesses Shinkai uses it to his advantage to often show a emotion driven story. Such as is here in The Place Promised in our Early Days. It is not a good as some of his other efforts but it is still worth the watch nonetheless. The story is about three friends living in a alternate reality Japan. Japan has been split in have by America who controls the south and the Union controlling the north. There is a tower that goes beyond the clouds and the three friends make a promise to go fly up to it using a plane that they salvage and start to repair. One day one of the friends disappear and story follows the other two friends and how they cope and ultimately try to find and help her. Like I said the setting is in a alternate history and there are some science fiction influences in the world. However it does not detract from the highlight which is he story. The first part of the story involves the three friends enjoying their summer. It is so genuine in terms of emotion and the bright lighting and beautiful drawn environments really brings the story to life. The character animations is not the best and the voice acting is OK at best but the environments themselves are so beautiful that you'll easily forgive the previous complaints. Shinkai excels at portraying emotions of lost and isolation especially when it involves old friends and lost lovers. It is no exception here. The main character is the most developed here as we hear his inner thoughts the most and his desire to see his lost friend again is interesting. As much as I like this movie it is hard not to compare it to another Makoto Shinkai film 5cm per Second. The reason I like that film better is because there was nothing that distracted the main story. It was clear and to the point with nothing distracting. Same can't be said for this movie. There is a lot of background here involving politics and a weird dream parallel universe science that gets convoluted and messy and at times it can get distracting. That being said if you want a movie with genuine emotion this is not a bad watch. In a age where anime tends to focus less on story and more and cutesy hi jinks and everyday nonsense of high school students who can't get a girl The Place Promised in our Early Years is a refreshing emotional and occasionally beautiful film that won't leave and tears in your eyes but might leave you staring at the screen even after the credits start rolling.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the film's alternate history Japan is partitioned between the US and the Union presumably the postWWII USSR. The Union side has built a giant tower on Hokkaido so tall it's even visible from Tokyo. Two teen boys just across the straights from the island are fascinated with the mysterious Tower want to build an airplane to visit it and get jobs at a factory in the area. The rest of this paragraph has possible mild spoilers. They let a teen girl in on the secret and she becomes fascinated with it too. That nearobsession with the Tower disrupts their lives in various ways starting with strange dreams.This was a pretty strange film. The relationships between the characters are very well portrayed. We get a pretty good feel for the three teens though a change in one of them as they grow up is less clearly defined. The boys' boss is an interesting supporting character. The plot works well as an influence on the three teens' lives but it weakens as it steps deeper into a blend of science and philosophy.The movie works best up until the mystery of the Tower becomes fairly clearly revealed. Afterwards the philosophical science fiction distracts from the very good characterbased storytelling. However because it's something so far from the ordinary I recommend it quite a bit more strongly than I would a more typical movie.I saw the movie in Japanese subtitled in English  with the amusing exception of about three lines of English which were subtitled in Japanese.".

The movie jumped onto details irreverent to anything in the beginning. Such tactic really does throw off viewers but is not completely wrong if you build up on the idea properly. Throughout the movie you had fillers small lines that made the movie much longer and further from helping to keep the audience engaged. I honestly was at the coastline of the movie the whole time I knew the idea and where the plot and movie was going but the movie did put an effort in tying the audience emotionally to the screen.

But still those 4 stars are for quality of workmanship alone and NOT for an enjoyable film. But you don't have to take MY word for it... Go ahead watch it. But I promise you unless the question  What do clouds mean? appeals to you then you will feel cheated out of the time you wasted watching this . Besides you can always just go to the drugstore and read anniversary cards for free.".

	schema:headline " A Truly Great Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "The director and writer of The Place Promised in Our Early Days is a certain Makoto Shinkai who is otherwise famous for movies like 5 cm Per Second and Voices of a Distant Star. He has been hailed as one of the greatest anime directors or even the greatest up there with legends like Hayao Myazaki. Since I saw his other two movies first and absolutely adore them it is needless to say that my expectations for this movie were sky high. Simply put I was not let down. Unlike the other two movies under the same direction The Place Promised in Our Early Days has a very definite plot with clear dips rises and climaxes. All in all it is an exciting story that puts you in the center of a divided Japan with different powers controlling both sides. The plot might seem dry and overused on paper but it is quite intriguing once you actually see it in action. Also driving the storytelling forward is this movie's scifi twist on parallel universes and how certain people react with them. Again this movie certainly brings around one of the uniquer feeling tales around even if it doesn't sound it. Anyone who has seen another Makoto Shinkai movie however will be able to tell you though that it is not the story that makes his movies special but the characters and the emotion that few movies come close to matching. Although it is still a huge distant beyond any other movie in this respect the power behind to emotions is probably the weakest of all three movies. Don't get me wrong you will still find the characters and their relations hauntingly and irresistibly real but you aren't AS horrified when a character's life suddenly changes for the worse. Still the feelings of loneliness desperation or exuberance all of which Shinkai is famous for are still found in their distinct amazing way. Since this was the second of the three movies it also seems as though it is a technical middlestep between the OK animation of Voices of a Distant Star and the truly breathtaking visual found in 5 cm Per Second. The animation will not disappoint you and there are some truly clever tricks that are used that make it look truly wonderful but they won't stand out among the best in the industry. The music might just do that however with its beautiful violinheavy soundtrack that creates a great ambiance for whatever scene is currently playing. Also the fact that the violin is featured in the soundtrack is of relevance to the plot and makes both the character progression and the music appear that much sweeter.Although I have criticized this movie a lot for every thing it did wrong it did a million things right. This still stands with the truly great anime movies out there and is a great watch for any fan of scifi influenced plots that will bring a surprisingly personal tone to the story.".

Spoonfeeding us with feelings. Bittersweet with emphasis on the sweet part. This it's a softboiled and a little mawkish picture that doesn't amount to much.There are flashes of intelligence though or at least refinement and elegance. Some nice scenes. And impressive visuals even though I'm not mad about the style.The characters are somewhat defined. Sweetness and cheese not messy cheese but bad smelling cheese never the less. But the plot takes a rather standard route.

The film picks up a bit at the end but getting that far felt like a chore to me and instead of thinking about what I just saw like I usually do when watching anime movies I just felt glad it was over. I could go on but those would just be nitpicks.I feel like there is a lot of substance to this movie and stuff I missed the first time but for the aforementioned reasons I doubt there will be a second time.The only times I even felt remotely this deflated after watching an anime movie was after watching Wings of Honneamise for similar reasons and Steam Boy not for lack of quality mind you but for its unnecessarily long runtime.".

A lot of elements that would form the basis of his later works are present in this scifi war drama but its presentation isn't refined enough and execution isn't up to the mark.";

What started out interesting and promising became one of the most incredible experiences that I could have ever asked for. The one thing I could say after watching it was wow. All I could think was this was an exceptionally beautiful filmThe film tells the story of Hiroki and Takuya two young boys who are trying to build a plan in order to someday reach an enormous tower in the distance. When they befriend a young girl named Sayuri they all make a promise to build the plane dubbed the Bella Ciela and someday reach the promised place. But as time goes by this prospect becomes thinner and thinner.This film is able to represent something that happens and is significant to everyone how we view the world. Perspectives change throughout the film we see the world as beautiful mysterious and wonderful and something to explore like most people feel when they are young. We then see it as depressing and sad through the eyes of someone who has felt loss and grief. And we see it as horrible and violent as the divided Japan inches ever so closer to war. The characters bring to life a beautiful parable to how we deal with our pain and world and loss. It creates real human relationships and characters. The beautiful surreality entrances you and makes you truly think about how your actions can affect someone. The film has this overarching line where people have a premonition of losing something. Innocence love wonder things that matter that we so often throw away and take for granted.It's almost hard to describe how this movie made me feel and how incredible it is. All I can say is that you stumbled onto a truly fantastic movie that I guarantee you will never forget the experience of watching. The characters story stunning animation surreality and style will have you thinking for ages afterwards.Beautiful.".

	schema:reviewBody "The most important thing you need to know is this is a film called 'The Ring Virus' not 'Ring'. This is a Korean remake but with new material which focuses more on Koji Suzuki's original Novel 'Ring'.A mysterious video tape causes the death of 4 teenagers all at the same time on the same day. One of the victims aunt decided to investigate and soon finds herself in a race against time to find the source of the video tape.This film chose a more plot driven story than the suspense of the other versions. However the scenes change fast and characters seem to just appear at new locations sometimes leaving you wondering why they have gone there. I have read the book so I found the film easier to follow. Another nice addition to this version of the story is a deeper background about the character Sadako or in this film EunSuh. Without giving too much away I felt it was nice to see the inclusion of her 'secret' that was left out of both the American and Japanese adaptations of the novel.The camera work is average and also very repetitive of the Japanese film sometimes using identical shots but there are moments that work better in this film and some moments that fall flat. I would only recommend this film to people who are fans of the ring series and would like to see the novel brought to screen more accurately or would simply like to see another adaptation of the story. This film should not be viewed as an introduction to the ring series but more as a supplement.Overall I enjoyed this film but couldn't help feeling it could have been better. But don't let people tell you its rubbish or that the 'new' plot themes ruin the original story because they don't and the new story lines are from the original novel and the true version of the story anyway.".

The story unfold at a much better pace and relies less on 'mysterious insight' and the random exposition that sometimes clutters the Japanese 'psychic horrormystery' films...you know the kind of scenes two characters walk up to a piece of string and one looks at it and starts telling the other and the viewer the events leading up to the string's appearance. And no I don't dislike that style completely it does save a lot of time and money for the crew and advances the story rather quickly...it's just that I found slower building story of the Korean version to be far more interesting  and as far as my investigations have found truer to the novel these films are based on. A good example is the omission of the distorted photographs which are in both the US and Japanese versions  I am told that was not in the book. The scary more straight horror aspect of the Japanese and even more so with the gore injected U.S. version have been toned down to an almost nonexistent state...one of the reasons why most people probably don't like this version. The video itself is a definite improvement. The fact that it doesn't 'cut off' abruptly but rather taped over before the solution could be given  that is brilliant! Especially in light of current urban legend interest. Simple version See Ring Virus if you want a more detailed storydriven version some say 'boring'  more of a creepy drama. The Japanese version if you want a mysterious psychicpowered ghost film. The US version if you want a hyperactive steroid injected retelling of the Japanese version in English. In the end it just depends which method you like best.".

It is also not a ripoff but the same story with several changes including slightly more sex and violence and a construction and atmosphere closer to The X Files. Now the reporter's partner is not her exhusband but an eccentric doctor and possible love interest who suspects supernatural foul play. The video is not an illicit underground fad for teens but an artifact that one group stumbles on by chance. We find out explicitly why and how it was made. The movie adds details that make the situation more concrete but apart from raising more questions that aren't answered this further explanation eliminates many of the story's scariest elements. The video which was unsettling in the original is nothing to speak of and THAT SCENEthe one the viewer is waiting foris a big disappointment. The staging of it might have worked in itself but it is overlaid with a colorizing effect that is obviously an effect and takes the viewer out of the film. The scene in the well however is very eerie. On its own terms this is a pretty good ghost story and the performance of the leading lady could hardly be better.

An accursed video tape is being spread around and people who don't copy it and share it or live a lonely life will die.And Unlike the US version of The Ring the video shown in this movie is not a typical ripoff of a Marilyn Manson music video. Instead it seems to start off with being rather kind and innocent yet abstract looking which makes things much more terrifying. The settings of the film are quite excellent. The scenes filmed on the Cheju Island is quite lush looking and beautiful I started to wish I was on the Korean islands.Heck I just  wanna go over to South Korea PERIOD!If you can find this film please get it.

Well this effort from Japan Which was made in 1998 btw shows how utterly magnificent and scary a movie can be with the most minimalist budget. It's based on the idea of a disturbing video which seems to be having strange effects on those who view it. Indeed 4 of those who watch it die a week later. Coincidence?To be honest I really don't want to give any more plot away as this is the sort of story like Sixth Sense that frankly one should see knowing as little about as possible.It is genuinely chilling throughout and uses suggestion and psychological manipulation to achieve the terror. A known trick with moviemakers and games makers To a lesser extent is that it is not what the viewer sees that terrifies them it's what they can't see. It's what they imagine and believe is happening which can so effectively scare them.And this movie does that outstandingly well. A word of warning just when you think it's over and the chills have stopped think again. The ending is the epitome of fear and if you're not tempted to cover your eyes you're a braver man than I.".

	schema:headline " Problematic adaptation of the Ring story";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is the first remake of the Japanese film Ringu which was later remade into the Hollywood film The Ring. If you measure it alone or in comparison with the novel it stands a passable affair but you can't really leave aside some comparisons with Ringu as The Ring Virus takes several key elements from Ringu while also reincorporating a few elements of the novel back into the movie. In the end some of this gets all jumbled and it leaves a couple plot holes as well as weakens believability at times.I noticed right away that The Ring Virus generally takes a different aesthetic approach. While Ringu had a lot more naturalfluorescent lighting generally casting the film in whites greens and blues The Ring Virus accepts warmer tones from incandescent lights and thus adds more yellows and oranges to the palette. Furthermore the camera takes more dynamic movements and positions in The Ring Virus although this is not necessarily a good thing. In some way the Corean remake looks a little busier than the Japanese version and the overall look doesn't seem as oppressive as the original. Nonetheless some of the shots are still taken directly from its predecessor.The story itself is primarily like Ringu. A female reporter finds a tape which upon playing curses her with seven days to live and she begins a desperate search for a way out of the curse. While the overarching story is essentially the same the details and characters have changed. The partner in crime in this instance more closely follows the novel as we find a medical researcher with no relation to the protagonist joins the case. Furthermore the story of the ghostly villain has changed as well and thus her reasons for her vengeful ways have also changed. The story is infused with more sexuality and less paranormal science than Ringu.Unfortunately many of these changes even if more closely following the book fail to work. First of all the supporting character of the researcher doesn't come across nearly as brilliant as he is presented as being and there appears to be some remnant of Ringu's exhusband in him as he has some unexplained bouts of clairvoyance. Also because he has no relationship to the protagonist its hard to believe that he would bother to join in her quest and endanger himself. In the book he is at least a friend of the male protagonist the sex of the protagonist got swapped in Ringu. I do have to admit that expansion of the ghost's story does lead her to be a more interesting character but it doesn't save The Ring Viruses from the weaknesses in the details of the story. Add in a couple plot holes and a lack of attention to detail and The Ring Virus fails to impress.I found myself yelling at the screen during the course of this film and slapping my head in disbelief. Maybe if I hadn't seen Ringu first this effort would seem less curmudgeon and while it does bring some interesting elements to the story overall the weaknesses in the direction and the story make it a slightly less than adequate affair. It might be an interesting first watch of the various Ring movies or an interesting comparison viewing but otherwise I think you'd be better served trying one of the other versions of the Ring story. Problematic. 510.".

The reason this film is so good is simple its is well acted well filmed and the plot isnt complicated. It doesnt twist and twined like many other films of the genre and this is the reason why even though it is subtitled it is incredibly easy to watch. The general mood of the film makes you feel uncomfortable from the outset and even when the film is over and you crawl from behind the sofa you cant forget this film because it makes you think.Lots of people compare this film to Blair Witch Project and i can see why although the plots are completely different both the films are made in the same simplistic way and because of this they dont have to rely on gore although i am a big fan of the goresplatter genre or big special effects to create the suspense or the scare.There is a holywood remake of this film in the pipeline which i am sure will be complete crap so i urge you all to watch this film rather than the remake.thanks for reading this and i hope you enjoy RING as much as i did.".

The general mood of the film makes you feel uncomfortable from the outset and even when the film is over and you crawl from behind the sofa you cant forget this film because it makes you think.Lots of people compare this film to Blair Witch Project and i can see why although the plots are completely different both the films are made in the same simplistic way and because of this they dont have to rely on gore although i am a big fan of the goresplatter genre or big special effects to create the suspense or the scare.There is a holywood remake of this film in the pipeline which i am sure will be complete crap so i urge you all to watch this film rather than the remake.thanks for reading this and i hope you enjoy RING as much as i did.";

	schema:headline " A superb movie with superb acting";
	schema:reviewBody "Never Forever is a rare gem in the film industry an arthouse film enjoyable to watch on a Friday night. Though I think English native speakers might have a bit of a problem with the male lead Ha Jung Woo's English speaking ability otherwise it's perfect. Sophie LeeVera Farmiga in a superb performanceis a white girl from a plain American family who marries AndrewDavid McInnisa successful Korean American lawyer from a high class family. The couple have a perfect life except for one thing. Andrew's sperms aren't strong enough for Sophie to have a baby. This one factor leads Andrew to attempt suicide.Next we see Ji Ha. Ji Ha is an illegal immigrant who is saving money so that he can bring his girlfriend to America but because he's living illegally there are many things he can't do like selling his sperms to a clinic for a small amount of money. After being rejected by the clinic he comes home depressed to find a strange white woman sitting in front of his doorstep with a dangerous proposal. Every time he has sex with her she'll give him 300dollars and if she gets pregnant he gets thirty thousand dollars in cash.That white woman is Sophie. Seeing as getting pregnant was the only choice to make her husband happy she buys JiHa's sperms after seeing him by chance at the clinic. What started as a strict business relationship starts turning into passionate love.I will stop here about the plot because if I write moreit'll probably become a spoiler but the main reason I liked this movie wasn't the plot. It was the superb performances of Vera Farmiga and Ha Jung Wooa relatively unknown in the international movie industry having bit parts in acclaimed director Kim Ki Duk's film 'Time'and 'Breath'.I've only seen Vera Farmiga in 'The Departed' and 'Running Scared'yet the depth she put into Sophie was something I rarely see an actor or actress perform. Not to mention full frontal nudity. Not many actresses like to take their clothes off even if it's necessary and if they do they ask for tons of money but Vera willingly did it in a three million dollar lowbudget film. Ha Jung Woo is how can I say it a phenomenon. I knew he was good looking after seeing him in 'The Fox Family'not many actors look good when they're dressed like a total nitwit.but didn't know the extent of his acting abilities. His English tongue is not perfectsurebut how many actors can act so well speaking a language that they're not completely fluent in? I cried my eyes out during one scene where he whispers into Vera's ear Saranghaeyoin English it means I love you the only Korean line he speaks .Overall Never Forever is a fantastic film. Go check it out when it opensif it opensin a theater near you.It's also worth knowing that the theme for the movie was composed by Michael Nyman the man behind the music for The Pianodirected by Jane Campion.".

	onyx:emotionText "Never Forever is a rare gem in the film industry an arthouse film enjoyable to watch on a Friday night. Though I think English native speakers might have a bit of a problem with the male lead Ha Jung Woo's English speaking ability otherwise it's perfect. Sophie LeeVera Farmiga in a superb performanceis a white girl from a plain American family who marries AndrewDavid McInnisa successful Korean American lawyer from a high class family. The couple have a perfect life except for one thing. Andrew's sperms aren't strong enough for Sophie to have a baby. This one factor leads Andrew to attempt suicide.Next we see Ji Ha. Ji Ha is an illegal immigrant who is saving money so that he can bring his girlfriend to America but because he's living illegally there are many things he can't do like selling his sperms to a clinic for a small amount of money. After being rejected by the clinic he comes home depressed to find a strange white woman sitting in front of his doorstep with a dangerous proposal. Every time he has sex with her she'll give him 300dollars and if she gets pregnant he gets thirty thousand dollars in cash.That white woman is Sophie. Seeing as getting pregnant was the only choice to make her husband happy she buys JiHa's sperms after seeing him by chance at the clinic. What started as a strict business relationship starts turning into passionate love.I will stop here about the plot because if I write moreit'll probably become a spoiler but the main reason I liked this movie wasn't the plot. It was the superb performances of Vera Farmiga and Ha Jung Wooa relatively unknown in the international movie industry having bit parts in acclaimed director Kim Ki Duk's film 'Time'and 'Breath'.I've only seen Vera Farmiga in 'The Departed' and 'Running Scared'yet the depth she put into Sophie was something I rarely see an actor or actress perform. Not to mention full frontal nudity. Not many actresses like to take their clothes off even if it's necessary and if they do they ask for tons of money but Vera willingly did it in a three million dollar lowbudget film. Ha Jung Woo is how can I say it a phenomenon.

I believe this ethnic pairing  currently perhaps the only interracial pairing that actually occurs less frequently in Western movies than it does in real life  will become more commonplace as the Asian cinema industry matures as the West becomes everincreasingly comfortable with the East as both sides evolve towards the human average and there are more Asian actors from which to choose.Now that aside let's get back to the film itself because it is more than capable of standing proudly on its own feet without its groundbreaking nonchalant attitude towards race.Tremendous acting especially from Ms. Farmiga and Jungwoo Ha the homewrecker. The amount of emotion that these two are able to convey in nonverbal moments is truly stunning. You will be moved.The set designs and cinematography in addition to the beautiful actors themselves are a visual feast  a real aesthetic treat.The sex scenes were very tasteful and welldone. As the relationship develops so clearly does the depth and honesty of their physical relations to the point where Farmiga's character is able to climax by simply daydreaming about her lover.You may know the entire plot line to this movie already and you will still have an A experience watching how it was executed.I loved this film.

But as with many of the other treasurable small independent films this one feels even better in the privacy of the home  the small screen somehow allows the powerful emotions of the story to be more focused. Sophie Vera Farmiga is the beautiful Caucasian wife of wealthy and respected Korean Andrew David Lee McInnis and the couple seem to have it all  looks a closeknit family beautiful home etc.  but there is an underlying tension Sophie and Andrew have been unable to conceive and bear a child a fact that troubles Andrew's very orthodox Christian family and profoundly affects Andrew's sense of worth. Though the couple has sought professional assistance their marriage remains barren. Andrew's fragile stance results in a suicide attempt and in trying to correct the cause of this tragedy Sophie decides she will attempt to conceive from a donor. Because both members of a couple must consent to artificial insemination Sophie's plan is thwarted except for one aspect visiting the clinic she has selected is a young Korean man named Jihah Jungwoo Ha who is attempting to be a sperm donor but is rejected because he is an illegal immigrant. Overhearing this exchange Sophie follows Jihah and finally discovers where he lives. She approaches him with a business deal  she will pay him 300. for each session and when she becomes pregnant she will pay him 30000. Jihah is shy at first but he is working in a meat packing plant and dry cleaners trying to save enough money to bring his girlfriend from Korea to the USA. Desperate for money Jihah consents and Sophie begins her visits to him when her cycle is conducive to conception. The relationship is one of quick polite encounters careful to avoid interpersonal factors that might make either partner uncomfortable. But a sense of interdependence evolves and when Sophie achieves pregnancy the couple decides to part ways. Sophie's pregnancy at first overjoys Andrew and his family and the couple's future looks bright. But both Sophie and Jihah are unable to dismiss the intimacy of the relationship they have developed Andrew discovers Sophie's adventure and the marriage falls apart while Jihah informs his girlfriend in Korea that he will never be able to bring her to America. At this vulnerable point the film simply ends  some years later Sophie is at the beach with her son and is again very pregnant and the viewer is left to decide the resolution. Vera Farmiga is even more beautiful in this role than her many other roles and never for a moment loses out empathy and understanding of the decisions she makes. Both of the men are strong as are the various actors who flesh out the film. This is a tough topic to relate but writerdirector Gina Kim allows the acts of love to be the memorable echo the film leaves behind. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "Vera Farmiga is one of those rare actors that is emotionally present in roles that require vulnerability and honesty. I remember seeing her first in that shortlived TV series Roar. She alone among all the actors in the cast that included a young Heath Ledger seemed to project real emotions in a series that was flirting close to Xena territory.So Director Gina Kim could not have found a better actor to play the role of Sophie a woman who must make difficult choices involving two men and their respective worlds. Much will be made in Asian American circles about the intimate scenes Farmiga has with men of Asian descent. Beyond the novelty of such pairings in film these scenes underscore one of the peculiar aspects of the movie while the men in these scenes go through the ahem motions Farmiga actually acts.That disparity is apparent in almost every scene Farmiga has with the Asian actors. While the male leads Jungwoo Ha and David McInnis are dutiful journeymen in their roles they don't reach the honesty that Farmiga is able to bare. Against Farmiga's acting Ha's and McInnis's performances come across almost as recitation.I can see Ha's delivery fitting seamlessly in a cutesy Korean miniseries. Someone should tell male actors not to grip their hair with both hands when the scene calls for inner turmoil. It comes off as pantomime. That someone should have been the director. While plot and composition worked well I found Kim's direction of the acting lacking. Perhaps she was working within the limitations of the acting abilities of the male leads. In that particular case she should have recast those roles.The lapses in the direction of the actors are apparent when lines are spoken by the male leads. There is an odd stiffness to the delivery that sounds off to nativespeakers and those of us who immigrated to the States at a young age. Something in the cadence and intonation that distinguishes someone reading Shakespeare and someone speaking as Hamlet. Ha may have had an English tutor in Korea that spent too much time incountry because he actually does a fine job with lines he speaks in Korean. I marvel at actors who can truly act in two different languages. Sidow and Streep easily come to mind.Kim isn't a native speaker and so she will have to develop a sensitivity to the sound of spoken English as other nonnative directors have had to do. That ear is what she will have to develop if she is going to be casting lessgifted or lessexperienced talent. Ang Lee had the same problem in his early English language movies and those actors fresh out of Juilliard. It's the difference between JeanPierre Jeunet directing Dominique Pinon in French and Jeunet and Pinon respectively in English. Alien Resurrection was a just an action movie and the weird delivery by Pinon and some of the supporting cast was noticeable. Sigourney Weaver made out on her acting chops alone. Thankfully this movie is centered around Sophie and so Farmiga binds the narrative with her honest performance. The role of Sophie really could have been played by an Asian actor and the story could have been a Koreanlanguage movie about a Korean American woman. Perhaps Kim wanted to give emphasis to Sophie's isolation and to that central dilemma of the story.There are certain elements of Korean and Korean American culture that are played to nearcaricature the cold oppressive motherinlaw and the zealous pastor for instance. So I must wonder if the story came from Kim's own deliberation about her relationships and choices she has had to make as a Korean and a Korean American. For Farmiga it is another remarkable performance to add to her growing body of work.".

	schema:headline " Farmiga's Performance and Fairy Tale Plot Transcend Film's Flaws";
	schema:reviewBody "Never Forever is a deeply flawed movie replete with missed opportunities that whiz right past like rush hour buses in front of a motionless commuter. It is also well worth seeing for a riveting performance by Vera Farmiga a suggestive plot and its treatment of unusual topics.Sophie Vera Farmiga a beautiful blonde trophy wife is determined to give Andrew David McGinnis her masteroftheuniverse very wealthy and successful husband the child he cannot father himself. He is infertile. Her husband is Korean so she chases down Jihah JungWoo Ha an illegal Korean immigrant and offers him three hundred dollars for every time he has sex with her and thirty thousand dollars once she gets pregnant. The two perform the act with complete alienation but eventually develop feelings for each other. The plot is of course implausible. It reaches its height of silliness when Sophie tells Jihah she will pay him the bonus of 30000 if she gets pregnant. Why the bonus? Would he really not have sex with this beautiful woman for three hundred dollars if he did not get the bonus? Are there other beautiful women out there offering bonuses of 25000 and does Sophie need to remain competitive? Further Sophie reveals no knowledge that a woman is fertile for a short window every month. Is she having sex with Jihah outside of that window of opportunity? Apparently so because no seasons pass all the action seems to take place during the same month. Finally why not just go to a sperm bank or use a turkey baster? Indeed why does Sophie remove every stitch of clothing? You really don't need to remove everything you've got on in order to perform the act necessary for pregnancy. The film's marketers show a healthy respect for the market appeal of nude Vera Farmiga.Most of the action takes place in Sophie and Andrew's rich cold white empty house and Jihah's squalid lurid redandgreen walled tenement. The director did not create enough atmosphere with these two sets. I never get a sense of Jihah's room. In one scene it rains. That scene should have been milked for all it was worth two strangers separated by race and class united for a moment in a tiny apartment as rain falls outside. Sigh.Also so much more could have been done with the sex scenes which are rather flat and unimaginative. Sophie and Jihah connect and transcend barriers of race and class through this one act. I wish that they had been depicted with more eloquence.In spite of the criticisms this movie is well worth seeing. It isn't prurient. It's really a fairy tale about connection in spite of distance. Like a fairy tale the film suggests and evokes more than it depicts and the viewer's imagination is left to fill in the blanks. Never Forever is also worth seeing because it is unusual. This is the only American film with a Koreanborn Korean lead with a thick Korean accent that many viewers may ever see. Finally the film is worth seeing for Vera Farmiga's riveting performance. She conveys volumes with a glance. Sophie is not very bright and has limited strength. She sits around her gilded cage all day while her maid cleans her house and her husband works. She's simply not very likable but Farmiga makes Sophie very watchable. JungWoo Ha as Jihah is also fascinating. He's not particularly good looking. He makes for a convincing illegal immigrant. He is short slight and wears stained tshirts. As the film draws closer to him and spends more time with him though the viewer can see what is special about him and comes to care about him  this process parallels the experience of falling in love. At first the other may come across as not that special but as two people get closer together they see what is special about the other.".

	schema:reviewBody "I set out to enjoy this movie hoping for something that would take the best elements of movies such as Unfaithful and The Rabbit Hole and mix them with some independent flair and lesser known but capable actors.The problem with this film is that there is one actor who is convincing... Farmiga. What's she manages to convince a pragmatic viewer of is another matter for later in this review. The two male main characters do workmanlike unremarkable jobs of portraying relatively stereotyped characters that of the depressed middle aged man who can't have everything he wanted in life and a naive 20 year old kid who falls in 'love' because he receives the one thing guaranteed to cause a 20 year old to throw caution and logic to the wind. Never mind that it's delivered with more than a nod to the old saw Love like you're being paid.Moving on to Farmiga I think it's helpful to examine the absurdity of the plot. She's obviously almost as clinically depressed as her husband. Any of these ring a bellfeelings of guilt worthlessness andor helplessness persistent sad anxious or empty feelingsI hope so because those and five other clinical symptoms are displayed in endless scenes of hand wringing melodramatic expressions of pain listlessly staring at walls while in a near fetal position conversing as if it takes EVERY... LAST... BIT... of energy... Is this really good acting?The plot is also beyond silly. She does all this for her husband who she 'loves'. She achieves what she has stated is her only desire and he responds with warmth and spark that had been utterly lacking before. Of course her response to this is to dream of dirty sex in a filthy tenement with a kid who's actual dialogue has mainly consisted of publicly implying quite crudely that she's a confused tramp who needs 'what he has' and isn't referring to the procreation aspects of their transactional trysts.If her mooning about seems like good acting then I guess the above weirdness seems like a love story destined to break through barriers and walls that most could not. I was not terribly moved by this movie although it was interesting watching it all play out. Farmiga is better when her talents are focused on helping a better movie play out logically.".

	onyx:emotionText "I set out to enjoy this movie hoping for something that would take the best elements of movies such as Unfaithful and The Rabbit Hole and mix them with some independent flair and lesser known but capable actors.The problem with this film is that there is one actor who is convincing... Farmiga. What's she manages to convince a pragmatic viewer of is another matter for later in this review. The two male main characters do workmanlike unremarkable jobs of portraying relatively stereotyped characters that of the depressed middle aged man who can't have everything he wanted in life and a naive 20 year old kid who falls in 'love' because he receives the one thing guaranteed to cause a 20 year old to throw caution and logic to the wind. Never mind that it's delivered with more than a nod to the old saw Love like you're being paid.Moving on to Farmiga I think it's helpful to examine the absurdity of the plot. She's obviously almost as clinically depressed as her husband. Any of these ring a bellfeelings of guilt worthlessness andor helplessness persistent sad anxious or empty feelingsI hope so because those and five other clinical symptoms are displayed in endless scenes of hand wringing melodramatic expressions of pain listlessly staring at walls while in a near fetal position conversing as if it takes EVERY... LAST... BIT... of energy... Is this really good acting?The plot is also beyond silly. She does all this for her husband who she 'loves'. She achieves what she has stated is her only desire and he responds with warmth and spark that had been utterly lacking before. Of course her response to this is to dream of dirty sex in a filthy tenement with a kid who's actual dialogue has mainly consisted of publicly implying quite crudely that she's a confused tramp who needs 'what he has' and isn't referring to the procreation aspects of their transactional trysts.If her mooning about seems like good acting then I guess the above weirdness seems like a love story destined to break through barriers and walls that most could not.

They each show a lot about the culture of the respective countries they were made in and also provide new takes on the terrifying and the appalling. They are each original in their own right although Cut could be compared to the Saw or Hannibal Lecter franchises in that there's a psycho who's trying to get a message across by way of murder and mayhem.I don't want to give details on the plots of any of them because I think that viewers need to experience them for themselves with no preconceptions going in but what I can say is that Dumplings has the most plot and is probably the one with the highest squeam factor Cut covers a rather familiar premise but with lots of fun moments you'll see and Box is more of an artistic endeavour with not much of a plot but for some reason I was enthralled and couldn't look away it's the one I liked the most.A solid 8 out of 10 for the efforts of these genius Asian directors.".

I found Miiki's the most perfect if not as much like his usual output as many would like. Park's Cut is a little pedestrian at times but so gloriously over the top and bewildering at others. Dumplings is a little predictable and I am surprised that it is said to still work at 90 minutes as it seems very much a single idea film. It's a good idea though and not without social interest and it has to be said the grossest of the three. The sound of tiny bones being crunched  aagh!!

	schema:reviewBody "watched Three... Extremes last night and it was insanely good. All three stories I thought were very thought provoking and again a little frustrating. Here's a short review...BoxTakashi Miike Japanese Language This is a nightmarish tale of a woman's horrifying dreams becoming reality but then again maybe not. That's the difficulty with this story there is so much surrealism that it's hard to tell. I liked the story some of which was very frightening. The ending however is completely totally bizarre and it totally left me clueless as to what Miike intended for the viewer to take away from this if anything. This is the weakest of the three stories but still very interesting and definitely requires multiple viewings.DumplingsFruit Chan Chinese Language This little story is my favorite of the bunch and also very very disturbing and pretty gruesome. Not because of gore or anything like that but because of the subject matter. It's no secret or spoiler that this movie is about vanity and a women's need to enhance her physical appearance to try and win her husband back from his whoring around. It concerns as most of you know the grisly meat a former lady abortionist uses to treat her rich clients vanity needs. This movie made me squirm on more than one occasion as the woman chomps down on the dumplings with a wicked crunching sound of tiny bones. This story has a lot of humor but it is very dark and totally black humor. Some may call it totally sick humor and all would apply in my opinion. The ending is very confusing for me especially one particular scene and I hope somebody explains it to me. I'm not talking about the grand finale where the leading lady commits the ultimate grossout but the scene with all the blood where some guy has been attacked by a women. This appears to happen at the apartment of Aunt Mei and then it shows her packing up and leaving. What was that all about? Who was the woman covered in blood and the guy that was attacked? Anyway the grand finale as Ching looks directly into the camera and commits what must be THE ultimate sin is flat out creepy as hell. Excellent short story and now I'm thinking whether I need to see the extended version.CutChanwook Park Korean Language Now this is one gruesome story which revolves around a movie director Lee and a former extra of his that's gone completely insane and terrorizes the director and his wife at their home. Park's short story touches on adultery relationships regret fame and childhood memories  as well as featuring amputation torture child abuse and a crazy set  as Lee and his kidnapper spar until the shocking but not altogether satisfying end. In fact the ending is the only bad part about this otherwise intriguing story. This is the most graphic of the three stories and the most brutal. But the twists and turns that happen towards the end tend to confuse the whole story. Nevertheless this is a great little horror movie and now I'm very hyped to watching my new DVD of Park's Oldboy.Summary This is one of the most entertaining dvds in the horror genre to come out of Asian for a long time. With three short movies totally over two hours it makes a great evening of demented entertainment by three exotic filmmakers. The second disc which contains a text portion which explains the plot of each story and then a Making Of extra for all three stories is very good. It's always interesting to see how these directors work and the interviews with the actors is excellent. The other thing I found interesting with this package is that each movie is in a different language which intrigues me. Since I'm watching so many Asian movies recently I find the languages of the Chinese Korean and Japanese to be so different but then again similar. This is especially true with Cut which has the psycho maniac speaking in a totally different Korean dialect which is almost funny to me being a Westerner and the other actors speaking in the standard Korean language. Not sure why they did that but the interview with the actor playing the psycho said he had a very hard time learning and speaking that interesting dialect. I had to watch several parts of each movie over again after I finished the first viewing because it's pretty hard to figure out what the hell's going on with one viewing. I'll never forget those chilling eyes of Ching in the closing scenes of Dumplings and that crunching sound as she enjoys her latest and most extreme serving of dumplings. yum yum........".

Here's a short review...BoxTakashi Miike Japanese Language This is a nightmarish tale of a woman's horrifying dreams becoming reality but then again maybe not. That's the difficulty with this story there is so much surrealism that it's hard to tell. I liked the story some of which was very frightening. The ending however is completely totally bizarre and it totally left me clueless as to what Miike intended for the viewer to take away from this if anything.

	schema:reviewBody "Three...Extremes is an anthology of three horror films by three respected Asian directors.Dumplings  Directed by Fruit Chan In Dumplings an actress who has entered middle age and begun to lose the attention of her husband to an affair with a younger woman visits Aunt Mei an old woman who still has the looks of her youth. Aunt Mei has a secret recipe that makes anyone look years younger but such an unnatural benefit comes from a truly abominable source. I found Dumplings to be absolutely stomachchurning. A horror movie that doesn't even attempt to scare you but actually tries and succeeds in my case to horrifying you. Not for the squeamish. Even the sound effects eventually became almost more than I could bear. Disturbing and entertaining.  810Cut  Directed by Chanwook Park A talented director and his wife are taken captive by a murderous utterly insane movie extra. Cut is darkly comedic utterly absurd and far more meta than the other movies in this collection. It took me a while to figure out whether I liked it or not but by the end of the segment I was won over. Like Dumplings Cut isn't frightening in the conventional sense. Instead it's flatout zany in a good way.  710Box  Directed by Takashi Miike The most haunting of the three segments. Box is about a jealousyfueled tragic accident involving two young sisters. The surviving sibling suffers from suffocating literally dreams and disturbing visions of her deceased sibling even years later as an adult. Box is probably the creepiest of the three and it has a psychosexual aspect to it that makes the whole thing even more unsettling. Definitely more of an atmospheric mood movie than the other two.  810I liked all three segments as well as the movie as a whole. I found Dumplings to be the most effectiveentertaining but I recommend the entire anthology. The three short films are not only memorable and very different from one another but they're also fairly unique among the other horror movies that I've seen.Overall  810".

	schema:reviewBody "When three famous Asian directors work together to make a three part horror film you know you're in for a good ride. Written by Fruit Chan Chan Wook Park and Takashi Miike they each have their own 45 minute slot to make you cringe with fear yet cannot turn away three films entitled 'Dumplings' 'Cut' and 'Box'. The first film of the three is 'Dumplings' staring one of People Magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People in the World 1998 Bai Ling and Miriam ChinWah Yeung. We follow the story of Qing a retired actress trying desperately to win her husbands love back with various anti ageing solutions. When she hears about Aunt Mei's Dumplings are the best things to regain your youthful looks she knocks on the flat door of the unusually young looking Aunt. After consuming a number of Aunt Mei's dumplings for a couple of weeks she starts to develop some unusual side affects. Because of the great success of this film the director went on to make a feature length version of 'Dumplings' with a run time of 91 minutes. The next instalment of the three is 'Cut' directed by ChanWook Park famous for his Vengeance Trilogy and stars Byunghun Lee and Wonhie Lim. One way to describe this section of the film is the Asian version of 'Saw'. It tells the story of a director on the set of his latest film but he's not to do work. he has been kidnapped by a jealous extra in his films and put into a life threatening situation hands bound and a rope around his waist he is set a task on one side of the room is an abducted girl and on the other his pianist wife both of them securely tide up. The director must decide to either strangle the little girl or his wife gets a finger chopped off every five minutes. I had a lot of problems with this story first of all there were a collection of open flamed candles behind the director I'm sure he could have used those to burn through the ribbon joining his hands together and also there was a number of times were the extra came so close to the director that he could have easily swung for him instead he just listened to him talk. After I put both of those things aside I really enjoyed this short film it had some very tense parts as well as some strong horror 15 minutes through you get sucked in and wish it also had a separate feature length. The third and final part is by Takashi Miike most famous for Audition and Ichi the Killer his film is called 'Box' this story contains a woman's worst nightmares as they become reality. Staring Kyoko Hasegawa as struggling writer Kyoko the story mostly focuses on the flashbacks of her childhood when she ran a sideshow act with her sister and father. The shows success is great until the attention comes away from 10 year old Kyoko and onto her sister Shoko her jealousy causes her to play a nasty trick on her sister that goes horribly wrong. I looked forward to this the most of the three and was the most disappointed there was hardly any dialogue so most of the film was purely based on assumptions and it also got quite boring watching the same flashbacks over and over again. On the other hand people that I watched this with found it to be their favourite I guess it's a lovehate kind of thing.Over all I give this film 7 out of 10 manly because of the first two films they each got you involved with the characters and had a great ending the third made me drop the score by a couple of marks if they had 'Dumplings' as there final piece I would have enjoyed this film a lot more a good thing about the films is the length of them as some of the times you may not have the time to watch a two hour feature you can choose to just watch one of the stories and turn it off afterwards. I do recommend this film to fans of horror or Asian cinema if not then try something new this films a good catch and worth watching.".

She has severe nightmares and has a hard time differentiating between her nightmares and reality.

Each film had a unique style and vision and all were good in their own way. I preferred BOX the least because it was the most slow and plodding and it was the one I could make the least sense of. In fact all 3 films have strange abstract endings that leave a lot open to individual interpretations. I have read many peoples ideas on the endings of each of these films and many reviewers have some decent insights  but I still think it's up to the individual to take what they will from these films. Also BOX has the creepiest atmosphere but the least actual violence. DUMPLINGS had a very sickly humorous almost exploitative feel to it. In fact the whole time I was watching it I was thinking This would have made a great premise for one of the mid90's Hong Kong Cat III films it just had that sort of feel to it. DUMPLINGS in my opinion had the most squirminducing scenes although they were not extremely graphic and mostly implied and were apparent due to the subject matter of the film. CUT had a good story and a decent amount of gore though nothing too outthere...and really just needs to be viewed to be understood.All the films in THREE...EXTREMES have some decent things going on although as much as I like a lot of Miike's work BOX just didn't do a whole lot for me  but DUMPLINGS and CUT were definitely worth the price of admission for these films. 810 overall  definitely recommended".

	schema:headline " Outstanding Top Quality Horror Film";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one very slick and glossy horror film that will challenge many Western viewers particularly the more provincialminded. It should shatter some prejudices and put a serious dent in some chauvinistic preconceptions.Overall it is very artfully sexy. The actresses are beautiful the actors are movie star handsome. The costumes sets and photography are lush and sensual. The production values are as high as you can get in any movie let alone a horror film. The final episode rivals Fellini's Amarcord for the sheer beauty of some of its imagery.The first of the three stories relies heavily on irony with its most powerful images as subtle as they are disturbing. The second one is more bombastic and caters to the Saw crowd with its sadistic bent and convoluted story. The final story meanders and is perhaps a bit perverse depending on how far you let your imagination roam to fill in the gaps.I would caution that this is not a film for 12yearolds having a sleepover. Not that it's too disturbing since it's softer than most. But other than the second segment it's probably too subtle. It's more likely to please sophisticated adults with a worldly view looking for a sumptuously hedonistic slice of dark drama. Watch it in bed with a trayful of chocolate and strawberries and a bottle of champagne.".

It should shatter some prejudices and put a serious dent in some chauvinistic preconceptions.Overall it is very artfully sexy. The actresses are beautiful the actors are movie star handsome.

The first story is Box from director Takashi Miike which is the story of an adult woman who's haunted b her dead sister. The second film Dumplings from director Fruit Chan centers on an aging movie star who starts to eat secret dumplings so that she can regain her youth. I won't mention what these magical dumplings are made of. The final film Cut from director Chan Wook Parks has a crazed extra kidnapping a horror director and making him choose between killing a child or having his own wife tortured. The weakest film for me was the first one from Miike not because it's a bad movie but because the last two are simply brilliant works that are damn near masterpieces. The Miike story has some very creepy moments and his direction is right on the mark by building up some wonderful atmosphere. The film dealing with the dumplings was just downright disturbing gross and in some ways very shocking. I wonder how many people have stopped or walked out of the film at the point when the secret is revealed? The third film is one people should compare to the similar Saw. Everything wrong with that film and its sequel are fixed in Cut. I viewed the Asian cut of this film from a Hong Kong DVD which features the stories in the order I mentioned. I believe the American cut is in a different order.".

	schema:reviewBody "This intriguing showcase of three short films from Asia's primary horror directors is in most a hitandmiss affair ranging from the downright shocking to the disappointing. The series when watched on the R4 DVD begins with the Hong Kong segment by maverick Fruit Chan. In classic Cat III form we are dealt intense subject matter and some scenes of extreme perversity in Chan's 33 minute DUMPLINGS which revolves around a backyard abortionist who has found an elixir of life in the form of eating fetuses. Some of the set pieces in DUMPLINGS are pretty extreme  the abortion scene is one of the sickest scenes to come out of Asia in 2000s and certainly one of the most perverse set pieces to be commercially released for the Western world. Of lesser extremity is South Korea's segment CUT. Directed by Chan Wook Park of OLDBOY fame this sees a crazed extra hold a director and his wife hostage simply because the filmmaker is 'too nice' and makes him look bad. CUT is the most conventional of the three and save for some quintessentially Asian horror moments plays out like a slick Hollywood thriller with some Hostelesque torture sequences. Finally there is BOX the segment I was most looking forward to by famed Japanese horror and yakuza director Takashi Miike renowned for his overly violent genre pieces. The convoluted plot of BOX circulates an author who has been living as a recluse all her life after the untimely death of her sister. This segment is truly terrible and lets the whole trilogy down. It is so boring so mind numbingly sublime that it makes the final forty minutes spoil the culminated two hours. Not only do the segments play out from most extreme to least but also from best to worst DUMPLINGS is the most accomplished and is truly disturbing stuff. If you can find this and Park's episodes individually jump at the chance for lovers of Asian horror will not be disappointed. But avoid Miike's BOX at all costs because for me it spoiled the whole film.".

Such a thing is usually under our expectations of long form meaning that the cinematic effect can be direct and uncomplicated.I thought Eros was extremely interesting in the freedom it gave its directors. Three men usually obsessed with elaboration were freed from that expectation and could give a poem rather than a novel. The results here are mixed though. That's because Asian horror is often never long form at all. Its one scene extended for a long time and surrounded by explanation. The disk that came to me had Dumplings by Chan first then Cutand Box last.Dumplings was for me the most fascinating. I'm challenged when I see multiple versions of something and among the most interesting of these is two versions of the same film by the same filmmaker. I had seen the extended Dumplings which I assume was filmed at the same time and simply edited differently. It had a completely different feel to it in the long version. The unsettling thing about that was that it was more real. The sound effects of the eating and the copulation were identical a remarkable effect. In this version its more otherworldly and there is one special effect at the end that underscores this and for me took all the horror out of what the woman was doing at the time. Its still Chan and why I watched the disk.Second up was something from Korean Chanwook Park I know only his Old Boy which is a remarkable mix of junk and genius. The setup here is mostly on the junk side. You can skip it if you watch movies the way I do.The amazing surprise for me was Takashi Miike's Box. I was very impressed with Audition but for some reason haven't followed up. He's amazingly prolific and it seems that he doesn't think things through before he starts. But this little thing is nearly perfect.Its a Japanese ghost story with a twist that makes it even more sharp. Its cinematic at its center. You can literally watch it with no voice. Its beautiful and I will include a few of its scenes in my list of films that handle fabric architecturally. In this case that includes plastic sheets.Its folded in the way I study. It involves three persons a family. Performers. It involves them performing for audiences and each other connected by performance sex kinship. We have performances of all these types dreams visions hallucinations all neatly nested within each other. Physically you will see that in a box will have several meanings along the lines of groundhog day so as not to spoil it body enclosing space and spiritual being.It really is perfect and lovely and haunting. You will watch it over and over.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Known as Three... Monsters in Korea where I bought the DVD Three... Extremes is an omnibus horror film like Twilight Zone The Movie and similar omnibus horror films containing multiple shorts often unrelated with separate casts and actors.In this case we have three notable directors from east Asia Japanese director Takashi Miike Hong Kong director Fruit Chan and South Korean director Chanwook Park. Each presents their own short visions of horror although perhaps it's more appropriate to say that although these are horror movies they are more disturbing than outright frightening.The first short entitled Box by Takashi Miike relates the story of a young writer who is having some difficulty distinguishing between her dreams and reality. It's the most supernaturally oriented of the three films and the most ambiguous. There are no particularly outright scare moments but the ambiguity of the story and the elements of the story are why the short can be a little disturbing. Primarily contemplative in nature it's ambiguity also serves as its foil as it's hard to draw anything more from the short than simple emotion and a sense of confusion.The second short entitled Dumplings by Fruit Chan is undoubtedly the most disturbing of the three. The film actually deals with some particularly relevant issues particularly the things that we do to be considered attractive and to return to former glory but the means by which the film makes such a commentary is very unpleasant. I'd have to say that it's a pretty effective film but certainly not enjoyable. I've discovered that a longer 90 minute version of this film exists as well and it'd be interesting to do a study comparing the twoif I could ever handle watching it again.The final short entitled Cut by Chanwook Park is the the most lively and comical of the works. Wrapped in a maniacal revenge story is a comment about the nature of evil in particular the reasons for which evil is committed. It's certainly the most glossy of the films utilizing CGI effects an elaborate set and dynamic camerawork. The short is weakened by the ending which doesn't appear to be prompted or meaningful and we can only guess at the reasons for which the ending occurred the way it did.All in all the three shorts are fairly effective works and compose a whole by their disturbing nature. There is nothing particularly compelling also Dumplings does make a particularly strong effort and Cut is particularly vibrant if a little shallow. Either way if you're looking to see three notable east Asian directors give their disturbing short takes on horror this is almost as good a place as any to see it. 710.".

	schema:headline " Three extremely great films";
	schema:reviewBody "It's almost impossible to talk about Three Extremes without going through each one individually because thee short films do not link in any way and are all brilliant standalone works. But it's also important to judge it on an overall experience. Although each film is different I couldn't imagine watching one without the other. They some how all feel similar in tone and style without them feeling all the same too which is exactly what's needed for an anthology film. All three films are of such a high standard and it brilliantly showcases the Asian talent on horror.Dumplings sets the tone for the rest of the series perfectly. It's not as distinctive in its directing or style as the other two I'd never heard of Fruit Chan but nevertheless it tells a rather brilliant story that goes places many film makers wouldn't dare to go! There are some seriously sick moments that will stay with you for quite a while afterwards and it makes you wonder what sort of sick mind would think this up! Nevertheless it is highly original and very disturbing which is what good horror is supposed to do. There are some strikingly creepy moments such as when the actress stares at you straight into the eyes. It's brilliant storytelling. 810 Cut could very be my favourite out of the bunch but I'm really not too sure. It captures Park's visual flair and style brilliantly with some exhilarating camera shots. I also liked how Cut managed to get a lot done despite it being set mostly in one room. Again it features some striking imagery and some sick decisions in the vein of Saw. Cut was also really quite funny at times and for me I think that the mixture of humour and horror did work in a weird way. The ending however is quite mindboggling but that's not to say it's bad. Let's not forget the first brilliant 35 minutes or so! It's incredibly tense and easy on the eyes. I enjoyed Cut a lot!910 Now I can't work out whether I liked Box even more? Box is definitely the most visually striking of the three and is even more extraordinary as it features very little dialogue. There's some beautiful scenery such as the beautiful snowy locations and the dark circus tent. Box is also definitely the most confusing of the three. The narrative plays out almost like a puzzle which you must piece together and interpret in your own way. Nevertheless the scenes it does provide are highly atmospheric and sometimes played out in complete silence making them very eerie indeed. I think that you'd get the most out of Box when watching the trilogy again because you'll be able to think of things and piece things together that you didn't before. It's a beautiful piece of work and is more like art really with its striking surrealism. 910Overall I could very happily watch feature length versions of all three short films and I know that a feature length version of Dumplings is out there! It could be a great introduction to Asian horror for an Asian horror virgin as it shows the great care and quality that goes into their films. They're all original pieces of work and I'd happily watch them again. This is probably the finest anthology work I've ever seen although some people may find them too bizarre and confusing!".

I think that you'd get the most out of Box when watching the trilogy again because you'll be able to think of things and piece things together that you didn't before. It's a beautiful piece of work and is more like art really with its striking surrealism. 910Overall I could very happily watch feature length versions of all three short films and I know that a feature length version of Dumplings is out there! It could be a great introduction to Asian horror for an Asian horror virgin as it shows the great care and quality that goes into their films. They're all original pieces of work and I'd happily watch them again. This is probably the finest anthology work I've ever seen although some people may find them too bizarre and confusing!";

	schema:headline " The best of the best of Japanese horror";
	schema:reviewBody "Title Three...Extremes Directors Takashi Miike Chan Wook Park Fruit Chan Review As of late Japanese horror directors are hot as hell. American horror directors have known this for some time and some have even gone as far as trying to add Japanese sensibilities to their films. First guy to come to mind is Eli Roth with his Hostel. Sadly Roth couldn't really get it right. Hostel turned out to be a bad imitation of a Jhorror film mixing Japanese style gore with frat boy mentality. It doesn't work because for the most part these Jhorror films aren't so much about gore or violence. Yes they have the gore but its not ONLY about that. They have more of a psychological thing going for them and not only that but they have something to say about society. Something a bit different then just having your average day killer going around killing teenagers though I don't mind a dose of that every now and again. Jhorror keeps blowing away anything that's being made in American horror films of today. I know that's a very common statement being made these days but it is very very true. Sadly most American horror films are commercial throw aways that nobody will give a crap about after a few months have passed by. But that's not the case with some of the horror directors emerging from Asian cinema today.Case in point the film Three Extremes which unites three of the best Japanese horror directors working today. Takashi Miike whos name is practically a house hold name amongst horror film fans. He is the man responsible for such great horror films as Audition Ichi the Killer and Gozu among a gazillion others. Then we have Chan Wook Park who shot straight to stardom with his incredibly unforgettable Oldboy. Which by the way is a film I strongly urge anyone who hasn't see it yet to do themselves a favor and go and rent it right now. And last but not least Fruit Chan the least know of the three at least to me anyway. The film is divided into three equal parts each part directed by a different director an anthology film if you will.The first story is Fruit Chan's Dumplings. A story about an aging actress who is searching for a way to stay young. When she comes across a rumor about a lady who makes these special dumplings that help you maintain a young appearance she quickly jumps at the opportunity. Whats in the dumplings? And are their any side effects to taking them? That's what shes about to find out. This story is a great way to start the film. Its funny cause at a glance the story appears to be a light and somewhat comedic little story yet before you know it the story ventures into dark dark territory. Stick through to the end for this one and you will be shocked. I promise.The second story in the film is Chan Wook Parks tale entitled CUT. This story is about a young horror movie director who is making a vampire film. The story opens with one of the scenes from his movie and let me tell you I know it's a movie within a movie type of thing but that movie that the director is making looked freakin awesome. It's almost as if director Chan Wook wanted to say I don't make commercial horror films but if I did this what it would be like! Those first opening minutes are awesome! After that we follow the director as he closes down the set and encounters a truly screwed up extra that has appeared in all of his films. What follows is a story filled with some great social commentary on the frustrations of an every man who's life didn't turn up as grand as he expected. This story blew me away with its visual style but I expected nothing less coming from the director of Oldboy and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance.The third story is Takashi Miikes tale simply called Box. A story about two twin sisters who live in a circus with their dad. One of the sisters is a tad jealous of the other and goes to extremes to quiet down her jealousy. This story is visually stunning but then again it appears that this was a prerequisite to make this film since all three short stories are equally good looking. Of course this story goes into freaky territory with an incestuous sub plot but coming from Miike that sort of thing is to be expected. Still I think that this story was mild with its violence and gore coming from a guy know for his relentless and extreme use of blood and gore. I guess Miike was going for a more psychological elegant and slick style. He really was shooting for something more artistic this time around.All in all this is a fine anthology film. It united some truly amazing talent and the result is nothing less then one of the best horror films of the decade. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is tired of watching horror films marketed for little kids. If you are searching for something artistic horrifying and with something to say then by all means indulge yourself in Three Extremes a fine example of how Japanese Horror is kicking American Horror firmly in its ass.Rating 5 out of 5".

My favorite was the Korean one. That makes three viewers each liking a different segment of the trilogy. As a litmus test it just goes to show that different people are always coming from different perspectives. Without a doubt THREE EXTREMES will elicit three distinct reactions from your tripartite gut. What else would you expect from a trilogy where each short film comes from a different country?First of all I thoroughly enjoyed the juxtaposition of Chinese Korean and Japanese cultures and I hope to see more in the future. What would I recommend for future CKJ trilogy releases? Horror might be the genre to stick with maybe something set in medieval Asia warlord style. Maybe something with Genghis Khan and Francis Ford Coppola vampires. But before I get carried away I had better check whether THREE EXTREMES made money at the box office. I'm supposing that it did not.Dumplings 6.0 Fruit Chan director of Public ToiletBoth the Oscillator and Mr. VMU were impressed by the shock value in the first installment. I agree some of the scenes strike the nerve like cold lightning but I wanted more shock. There seemed to be a lot voodoo floating around what with the cursed fetus and all but it pretty much went over my head. I have to admit I'm not up to speed on my Chinese voodoo. Unlike the latter two short films Dumplings features select scenes taken from a longer fulllength movie. I think watching the whole movie would fill in some of the holes where I was plain lost. What are these dumplings supposed to do? Why don't they work? Who are these people?Cut 8.0 ChanWook Park director of OldboyThe Korean installment features some lengthy sermons. The villain goes off ranting about the nature of society so on and so forth as the bound ByungHun Lee listens helplessly. I got kind of bored by the speeches myself but after THREE EXTREMES was over I realized that I liked Cut the best out of the three. It reminded me of the existential plays that Tom Stoppard used to write. The symmetrical film has four characters two of which are bound and gagged. The weird absurd situation produces a cozy environment where we can explore both the humor and terror behind psychosis. As Sartre said himself hell is other people.Box 7.0 Takashi Miike director of Iishi the Killer Audition Visitor QI have a feeling that Miike is the main reason most people come to watch THREE EXTREMES. Besides who really prefers Chinese or Korean movies over Japanese film anyway? Box is slow and quiet. That's all well and good but during the whole installment I was waiting with breathless anticipation for needlepoint shock. I'm sad to say that there is no shock. Most of the terror comes from hidden uneasiness as opposed to inyourface grotesqueness. I really wanted to see the bag monster from Audition. Thus Box gets a lot more interpretive than I had hoped for and that means it gets boring. I am also not a fan of Atsuro Watabe the male lead. His acting is annoying and more often than not gets on my nerves more than the coathanger does.JYJimboduckdotcom".

All of which have a horrific tale routed in it's story.Three extremes take two talented directors and one unknown from my perspective anyway and let them carve their own original piece of a puzzle that fits together in Three...Extremes. While I'm still impartial to Miike he does have talent. He has beautiful imagery in his films it's just that they also tend to have some story lacking. With his short BOX Miike gets you to think about what the outcome is going to be. His films are always twisted in some kind of way and asks the audience to look deeper into what they just saw. With BOX he ultimately disappoints with the ending. Cut the second short directed by Park has an uncanny resemblance to SAW as some might say. It deals with the psycho kidnapping someone and getting them to play a game or someone dies.CUT was my favourite segment out of the three and throws the viewer a curve ball at the conclusion. Which leads you to believe one of two things. Do you believe the events that you just saw and take them as face value or is there some mind tricks at play. Finally the first short actually is Dumplings from Fruit Chan. A name I never heard of but would like to hear more of. Dumplings doesn't have the edge that CUT has or the beautiful images that BOX has but it does have the disturbing factor. Which lands Dumplings in the good books.CUT is my favourite segment and Park did a great job at hinting that the film is not EXACTLY what it seems and it has the oh so cool factor that this film needed. BOX being the second film that I've seen from Miike still leaves me in the grey with him. I want to seek out more of his work but am hesitant because it hasn't impressed all that much. BOX isn't all that bad it's just not all that good and the viewer feels cheated by the end. Some might feel the same with CUT and be left very confused with the actions of some characters but it worked out it's in favour for some strange feeling.I'm going to let the cat out of the bag and tell you what Dumplings is about...eating aborted fetuses. Gross? Yes. Disturbing? Yes. Why did I like such a thing? Fruit handled it very well I have yet to see the full cut of the short but it leaves me wanting to know more. The ending...again with these endings left me very confused. What was with the tongue? It didn't flow with the rest of the film? Is she human?Finally if you're a fan of Asian cinema give this a little taste test. It's three for the price of one and you'll get some sort of enjoyment out of at least two of them. If you're the type that is uneasy hearing the crunching sounds of a women eating an aborted fetus you might want to skip these and look for Bambi.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stuff like this makes me question if it's possible it could ever be made in America. Sure we have David Lynch Guy Maddin even David Cronenberg adding to our wonderful world of extremely disturbing for the sake of disturbing filmmaking but could they go to this level? Or am I being unfair to say that this is a different level? It could be the same intent with a different approach...We have three segments each extreme in their own way. The first a shockingly grossout horror film involving foetophagia pardon me my neologism if there happens to be a real word for said consumption out there is about all the wonder in blood and gross biological matter you can possibly compress into gutchurning madness. Too bad it doesn't really have much more to it than that because honestly once you get over the initial gut reaction there's not much more to care about... no spectacular cinematography nothing really amazing in performances... no real reason to be a movie as opposed to a photograph a written story a bad tale told over candlelight. I'll just pretend it's all symbolic of the current issue over stemcell research and leave it at that.The second segment by the wonderful Park ChanWook of Oldboy fame gets a little better. Our little friend Park has an eye for torture I see as now it involves a movie director and his wife tied to his own houselike set a disturbed extra putting him through physical and emotional turmoil. This one has no longwinded development of psychological torturebyhypnotism this is straight out loseifyoudo loseifyoudon't. The focus on the stage lighting and the levels of truth and deceit make it an interestingly postmodern look at spectatorship as now these characters are forced to look at each other take up and remove their costumes in a twisted dynamic. Too bad that theme isn't really developed much more than just being there because again this film has a little bit less in terms of cinema. It has some neat tricks here and there just nothing to write home about.The third segment and my favorite is from my man the amazing Takashi Miike of Ichi the Killer fame. A much more atmospheric and involving film indeed this is the story of a woman who dreams fitfully about her accidental murder of her twin sister at the age of ten with a slightly more complex plot involving a circus performer and pedophilia. Mostly films that turn out to be just a dream are kind of disappointing but this has something fresh to add to the group. It also has the most to offer cinematically with real care put into editing production design imagery juxtaposition and whatever possible to embellish mood. Of all the segments this is the most artsy and lovely and really a good end to round up the features we've been subjected to.Overall don't expect to eat comfortably after viewing this film. Not gonna work out well. I wouldn't expect the most amazing stuff awaiting you but on the other hand if you're the type to be absolutely fascinated by the places the human mind will go see how you handle this.

	onyx:emotionText "Stuff like this makes me question if it's possible it could ever be made in America. Sure we have David Lynch Guy Maddin even David Cronenberg adding to our wonderful world of extremely disturbing for the sake of disturbing filmmaking but could they go to this level? Or am I being unfair to say that this is a different level? It could be the same intent with a different approach...We have three segments each extreme in their own way. The first a shockingly grossout horror film involving foetophagia pardon me my neologism if there happens to be a real word for said consumption out there is about all the wonder in blood and gross biological matter you can possibly compress into gutchurning madness. Too bad it doesn't really have much more to it than that because honestly once you get over the initial gut reaction there's not much more to care about... no spectacular cinematography nothing really amazing in performances... no real reason to be a movie as opposed to a photograph a written story a bad tale told over candlelight. I'll just pretend it's all symbolic of the current issue over stemcell research and leave it at that.The second segment by the wonderful Park ChanWook of Oldboy fame gets a little better. Our little friend Park has an eye for torture I see as now it involves a movie director and his wife tied to his own houselike set a disturbed extra putting him through physical and emotional turmoil.

The key plot device of the film is NOT simply that Japan won World War II but that the legendary Korean patriot Ahn Chunggun FAILED in his assassination of Japanese foreign minister Ito Hirobumi in China in 1909 thus sort of the point of the title being 100 years later. This single event is extremely important to the Korean culture and not only is their a gigantic memorial named after Ahn but also a form of Tae Kwon Do.

	schema:headline " Incredible movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "I didn't really know what this movie was about when I started it.  I wasn't disappointed.  The movie takes place in an alternate timeline where Japan owns Seoul and the rest of Korea. Korean terrorists wreak havoc in a fancy building for some asyet unclear reason and it's the job of two cops one Japanese the other Korean to find out what's going on.  What follows is one hell of a ride.  Make sure you're resting while watching this movie because you wouldn't want to get hurt.The first action sequence at the beginning of the movie sets the tone for the rest of the flick.  The shootout has this incredible intensity and never lets up.  The rest of the movie follows suit.  You don't really know what's going on at first but you know it's going to be explained and that it's going to be worth it.  The shootouts that follow only top one another which after seeing the first 15 minutes is quite hard to believe. They're so incredible.  They might not have the scale as 'Heat' or the budget of 'The Rock' but they sure as hell are as intense if not more and as good if not better than whatever comes out of Hollywood.As with 'Shiri' the action in this movie rests on one great story. Throughout the movie the characters become more and more like real people. No one is a hero no one is Superman here.  The characters are thrust into improbably situations but they always stay rather believable.  When they're not shooting guns the drama part of the story takes over and you're actually as impressed with what happens.  You feel for the characters and you're actually kind of glad you don't have to make the decisions they have to make.  I could kind of see where some of the relationships were going and I didn't really want them to go there but I suppose they had to. The story on the other hand is a complete mystery.  I never knew where it was going.This movie actually says something as well.  Just like in 'Shiri' it's not action for the sake of action  it's action for the sake of actually saying something.  It's slightly on the nationalistic side but that doesn't really bother me the message that the movie portrays is definitely worth the moments spent nationalism.  It's really not as bad as some other movies I've seen.  The movie is insanely political I was actually very surprised. No Hollywood studio would have the guts to do something like this.  I suppose the implications of the movie are universal but they chose to have Japan control Korea.  It's quite refreshing to see a movie an action movie no less with a thoughtful story.The cinematography is gorgeous.  I've seen all of 3 Korean movies and they all had this incredible visual style.  This one is obviously included. Most of the movie is shot with a lot of blues and grays.  It creates this nice calm atmosphere among the instances of carnage.  Add to that some great invigorating music which also reminded of the music in 'Shiri' but that's probably due to the fact that the same composer scored both movies and the entire mood is perfectly set.An amazing movie with brains and brawn everybody should enjoy this movie.".

A Koreanborn special agent tries to set the history right and his colleague a Japaneseborn and a friend of his tries to stop him.Although made in Korea dialogues are about 70 Japanese and you have to have some knowledge in the history of the two countries to fully understand this movie but the setting and basis is very imaginative and fascinating that anybody can appreciate it.  The two stars of the movie DongKun Jang and Toru Nakamura who are Korean and Japanese in real life are very fine and make up a nice team.  The action scenes which are plenty in this movie are nicely choreographed and serve to contribute to the story.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

	schema:headline " A First Class Asian Thriller!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Hollywood has made loads of Asian remakes recently and this would probably be another contender for their interest... although an American remake might have to be extremely bold. 2009 Lost Memories is one of the best Asian action films I've seen... period.First of all get those Hollywood tendencies out of your head. This is a film whose story far fetched though it may be seems to convey some very genuine weighted and apparent contemporary sentiment about a significant event in modern Asian history. Since the event and players around which the film is centered are indeed VERY real  make Wikipedia your friend   I would urge people from other parts of the world watching this film to try and imagine if something in their own histories had followed a similar plot to better appreciate the film from the vantage point of the storyteller. DO NOT watch this film if you're only looking for some John Woo style action. It's really not about the action at all.I'm a typical nonAsian very limited knowledge of Asian history and absolutely no implicit understanding of Asian culture or the mark that such history has had on modern Asian convention. I think this film among many offers a few clueins about the inward tensions concerning the past between Asians that are completely unknown to the rest of the world. It may seem deliberate as a matter of course to people from the region most oblivious outsiders would still be guessing. In short it is about an alternate reality in which Korea never gained independence from it's status as a Japanese protectorate. Now add time travel... and enjoy the film.Although it's a little on the long side it was fun all the way through. The storyline never dropped or suddenly got slow and there was nothing that could be completely lost in translation as I find is often the case with a lot of other transcontinental cinema. There's PLENTY of gun action for such aficionados. It was coherent and very suspenseful from start to finish. Even the music played to great effect perfect at certain instances like you see in film from time to time. All in all a fully enjoyable feature.I liked this film not for the time travel scifi gun fights or adequate special effects but for letting me see someone else besides Hollywood pay homage to their own heroes. In Japan this might be a horror film.".

	onyx:emotionText "Hollywood has made loads of Asian remakes recently and this would probably be another contender for their interest... although an American remake might have to be extremely bold. 2009 Lost Memories is one of the best Asian action films I've seen... period.First of all get those Hollywood tendencies out of your head. This is a film whose story far fetched though it may be seems to convey some very genuine weighted and apparent contemporary sentiment about a significant event in modern Asian history. Since the event and players around which the film is centered are indeed VERY real  make Wikipedia your friend   I would urge people from other parts of the world watching this film to try and imagine if something in their own histories had followed a similar plot to better appreciate the film from the vantage point of the storyteller. DO NOT watch this film if you're only looking for some John Woo style action. It's really not about the action at all.I'm a typical nonAsian very limited knowledge of Asian history and absolutely no implicit understanding of Asian culture or the mark that such history has had on modern Asian convention. I think this film among many offers a few clueins about the inward tensions concerning the past between Asians that are completely unknown to the rest of the world. It may seem deliberate as a matter of course to people from the region most oblivious outsiders would still be guessing. In short it is about an alternate reality in which Korea never gained independence from it's status as a Japanese protectorate. Now add time travel... and enjoy the film.Although it's a little on the long side it was fun all the way through. The storyline never dropped or suddenly got slow and there was nothing that could be completely lost in translation as I find is often the case with a lot of other transcontinental cinema. There's PLENTY of gun action for such aficionados. It was coherent and very suspenseful from start to finish. Even the music played to great effect perfect at certain instances like you see in film from time to time. All in all a fully enjoyable feature.I liked this film not for the time travel scifi gun fights or adequate special effects but for letting me see someone else besides Hollywood pay homage to their own heroes. In Japan this might be a horror film.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie has a semi interesting plot. Not very new or original neither very bad or too obvious. As usual when it comes to South Korean popular movie industry the craftsmanship is next to flawless. The lighting and the scenery are beautiful the soundtrack is very sentimental and bordering to bercheese but that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone with the slightest experience in Asian movies. The acting is also good though the English dub doesn't seem to even try to do any lip sync and brings down the overall impression. The special effects are functional but not really that spectacular. Also the action scenes have way to much slow motion for my taste. Though I guess this is made in order to boost the sense of patriotism. And this is where I have my main criticism.It contains about all components of the propaganda the nationalistic parts of South Korean society likes to flatter itself with. Embarrassingly obvious even more than usual. North and South Korea are united because they really are brothers. No Korean would harm another Korean. Japan is an enemy has always been and will always be. Japanese people are not to be trusted not even those you consider close friends. The Korean on the other hand are brave and self sacrificing with a pure heart. The key to the entire plot comes from the superior ancient culture and system of worship from the Korean peninsula. There are so many subtle details that are being pushed in that mean really a lot if you have an understanding of Korean culture like the Korean main character has become so Japanese he doesn't even eat Kimchi !.I agree that the patriotism is so much an undisputed part of Korean culture even today that it should not come as a surprise and I have enough experience of South Korea to be very aware of this when watching this movie. The problem here is that this script is so saturated with nationalistic propaganda that I feel it being written for this very purpose. It can sometimes lead to umm... interesting results though seldom to properly good ones. It's the equivalent of the American action movie where all baddies have a foreign accent smoke cigarettes and the bad guy boss has a hint of latent homosexuality. Just translate those components into Korean values. Enjoy it as nobrainer entertainment for killing some time or more interestingly for understanding the components of Korean nationalism and the grudge toward Japan in a commercial movie production. If you want to see a really good Korean movie for there are lots of them pick another one.".

One of my favorite things about this film is that it shows the extremes of what people will do to either keep that history or change it. Its race against race father against son and friend against friend in a race for a nation's identity. Who will win who will lose and who will ultimately decide the fate of the world? Fantastic action sequences that seem almost too real. The bloodshed abounds in this film as we see repeated scenes of terrorists face off against police forces in shootouts that can only end with the annihilation of one group or the other. The battle scenes are realistic in that you don't see your standard good guys never miss while bad guys can't hit the broad side of a barn routine these are truly horrific battles with a large casualty count from both sides.The film however isn't all about action. The story itself stands on its own as you try to piece together the jigsaw of clues and deadends to find out what in the world is the truth. Even when you arrive at the climax of the whole story you are left on one cliffhanger after another wondering if this will be the final bullet to decide it all...and at the ending there is no cliff hanging the writers have thrown you off the cliff and you wonder what awaits you at the bottom.Despite this nail biting ending the film had is draw backs 1 a plot that progresses like a starting train VERY slow at first before gaining tremendous steam at the end 2lots and lots of blood not for the squeamish 3the ending had a loose end that was never explained and 4you will want more character background and insight from the two main characters.A very good film that had plenty of room for improvement.".

Watching this movie as someone who lives in Tokyo it was interesting visually to see the Korean take on a Japanese City and Japanese Police the JBI  gotta love it. I really love the visual style of Korean movies and videos and have enjoyed more than a few Korean movies and I have to say Japan produces a fair too many clunker movies Korea has a better strike rate.I'll give the movie credit for being intriguing you get hooked in wondering what is this and even giving an interesting story.

I was rather looking forward to the stylized action sequences.This is where I was let down. Now pardon me if I'm wrong but Mr. Hero is standing here in front of 6 masked bad guys letting off a hail of Uzi fire yet he seems to find 5 minutes to drop his gun and tearfully look at children friends loved ones falling over in slow motion as violin music cuts in over the background.Honestly can one person here who liked this movie honestly say they actually forgot that the guy is surrounded by guys with machine guns and was pulled into any kind of emotion by the violin music? The nationalism bugged me just as it would for a Japanese movie but I know this is the Korean style so it didn't bother me too much. But honestly unless you are a hardcore fan of Korean cinema style I wouldn't bother with this  there are much better examples out there.".

I decided to watch 2009 Lost Memories after a very positive review on one Hong Kong movie website. After all they were quite correct and I give my highest recommendation for this movie.The backbone of the plot is basically about the ongoing struggle between Korea and Japan over territory. Coming from a country with territorial dispute Cyprus I've more than some similarities which made me enjoy the movie more. Plus it is refreshing to watch an action movie without revenge as the main motive. Honestly I didn't know what the struggle between Japan and Korea were all about and I have learned some after watching 2009 Lost Memories. It is always nice to learn and this movie teaches you without you knowing it.Imagine yourself like this...You live a life for maybe 30something years have good job and a successful career as an agent. One day you meet with somebody telling you that everything you believed in was wrong besides your enemies are your friends and your friends are your true enemies. What would you do ?Quite complicated matters right? Korean superstar Jang Dong Gun manages to represents all these confusions of JBI  Japanese Bureau of Investigation agent Sakamoto incredibly well that you cannot prevent yourself from thinking thank God that I'm not in his situation Besides development of Sakamoto is very impressively presented. He begins the movie as a dedicated and determined JBI agent then develops into a guy that hesitates to fire even a single bullet because of his confusions.The movie is not about action only this movie manages to have heart and brains as well. It is a ride of emotions right from the title screen to the rolling end credits. There is patriotism anger heart break disappointment betrayal sadness suspense and then some. Thankfully the characters are really well developed so that you can relate to them  quite easily.2009 Lost Memories is quite a long movie but the script is so well written I could not find a minute to get bored. There are very shocking moments in the plot that changes the direction of the movie entirely. You can think of it like a rollercoaster ride one minute you are very sure of the direction that is ahead but next minute you will be taken into a completely different route.Don't get it wrong thinking that there is small amount of action in this one. Action fans will find  quite a lot to enjoy in 2009 Lost Memories. All of those action scenes are superb done and makes you want to watch them again and again as the end credits roll. The action scenes are on the same level of any big budget Hollywood actioner minus the car chases that isThere are some scenes in this movie that I will not easily forget especially the scene that reveals everything. It shows the facts through both sides point of view and the dialogue in this scene fits perfectly.Plus I can easily state that 2009 Lost Memories has one of the best climax scene ever. The time really stands still and so will your breath. There is so much tension and emotions in that scene that cannot be described simply by words. You must watch it to understand what I am talking about.I have watched this film with English subtitles and since I don't know any of them I couldn't figure out which parts were Korean which parts were Japanese. But from what I have found out from the internet Jang Dong Gun did a great job in speaking Japanese. Props to him for his dedication to his role his future seems really bright.If I had known some Korean I would surely go for Special Edition DVD set as it features 311 page book called 2009 Memories of Jang Dong Gun that I really want to read. Such a shame that I have to miss it. If I learn Korean one day I will add this DVD to my collection.The girl could have been more beautiful and I wished that there would be some fighting but these are very minor points. Do watch this movie whenever you can. As I said in the beginning my highest recommendation.".

It wasn't about Japan being on the winning side in WWII. It was about a pivotal assassination in 1909. Yes it is hard to see how this lead to Japan being on the wrong side in WWII but I suspended my disbelief for this point. The action scenes were well paced and had impact although they did become a little repetitive. The agonizing the hero went through over the theatric death of the child and his girl friend who mysteriously came back were a little over the top. And it was flagrantly nationalistic.However I did find the film to be wellpaced overall with good action scenes and interesting characters. I liked the method they used to unveil the timetravel scheme. It was good enough that I accepted it as inevitable. It had enough little twists to make it a memorable film and one that I find myself mentally revisiting it. I liked it.".

The action scenes were well paced and had impact although they did become a little repetitive. The agonizing the hero went through over the theatric death of the child and his girl friend who mysteriously came back were a little over the top. And it was flagrantly nationalistic.However I did find the film to be wellpaced overall with good action scenes and interesting characters. I liked the method they used to unveil the timetravel scheme. It was good enough that I accepted it as inevitable. It had enough little twists to make it a memorable film and one that I find myself mentally revisiting it. I liked it.";

	schema:reviewBody "The year is 2009 but it's a 2009 in an alternate history to ours where Japan fought with the US in World War II and won... and still occupies and controls Korea. Most Koreans have accepted the state of affairs after 100 years but there is still a small band of terroristsfreedom fighters that want to see Korea regain independence.Our hero is a cop of Korean descent who now works in the Japanese Beaureau Of Investigation comfortable socialising with Japanese friends and speaking the language as default. After a major attack on an exhibition centre however he begins to investigate the terrorists to understand their motives. As he finds out more about their fight he begins to question the legitimacy of Japanese occupation and starts to feel the Korean blood flowing stronger in his veins.Clearly inspired by the box office success of SHIRI in 1999 the producers of 2009 LOST MEMORIES have conspired to produce a slick action thriller with production values that compete fairly well with Hollywood productions of only a few years back. Like SHIRI the trade off for absorbing some of Hollywood's virtues seems to be acquiring some of its vices too  chiefly a shallow script with major plot holes and a certain amount of xenophobia. These qualities are worse in 2009 than SHIRI and to be fair worse than the better Hollywood productions too.The script for 2009 LOST MEMORIES can hardly be called strong but it is interesting and not overly predictable despite the presence of large amounts of cheese which maybe explains why it's so full of holes?. I did find myself checking the time quite frequently as I watched but I got through all 130 minutes of the film without feeling too bored. It would have been much harder to say this if it weren't for the action scenes however which are of a very high calibre. There are just enough scenes of cool Hong Kong style gunplay to qualify 2009 LM as one of the better action movies of recent years. Also one of the more violent action movies  the body count is huge and there is no hesitation about showing the damage a bullet can do to the human body.The production values are mostly very high  some great sets and props many of which get severely destroyed in the gun fights. Good cinematography though that hardly needs mentioning for a Korean film these days. The soundtrack is perhaps a little OTT but then so is the melodrama in the script. Acting is acceptable though no performance approaches great.Overall I was rather disappointed with the film having heard so many very positive opinions expressed about it. I liked the action but felt the script could have been a lot better. It's a little too much like a Hollywood movie which was probably what the producers were aiming for but isn't what I want when I watch a Korean film. It's bound to be a film that people will be talking about a lot and may influence the direction of the Korean industry so any fan of Korean cinema should probably watch it if they haven't already".

Do you think you should fight back your friend or leave him alone condsidering that you guys are FRIENDS?2009 Lost Memories is a very creative film that emphasizes on the historical event which happened decades ago.  As every historians know Japan once controlled Korea as if it was their own nation.  While ruling Korea they killed many Koreans due to the fact that they fought for indepndence. However those brave people didn't give up and tried their best.  As an outcome many Korean fighters were able to destroy some Japanese soldiers and at last they got their country back.  However in this movie everything has been twisted.  The Korean independence fighters actually failed to destroy essential Japanese forces thus Korea finally became a Japanese colony until year 2009.  This is the creative part of the film.  The director and writer actually changed the whole historical event in a very attractive way.So far I haven't seen any kind of Korean SF movies that actually contained meaningful lesson such as 2009 Lost Memories.  In my opinion the CG effect and remarkable gunshot actions put into this film allowed this movie to look very outstanding professional and terrific.  It's hard to find such a Hollywood style blockbuster movie in Korea therefore 2009 Lost Memories caught my attention a lot.  However I like this film predominantly because of the warm message given to my heart.  Your nationality is more important than friendship.  After watching this movie this was the only sentence which came to my thoughts.  I learned that no matter how important your friend is it can not be more essential than your country.  Your country has given you an identity.  Your nationality is only one which no other nationals can imitate or gain.".

This leads to some melodrama and though the two hour 14 minute running time sans credits would be shorter if these instances were mercifully removed this does really get to you you find yourself caring and feeling the impact of bullets and the grip of tension. The acting is pretty good. I watched this with subtitles not dubbed and while I had to read along to understand what they were saying the power of the way they deliver the lines came through quite clearly. The action is all shootouts it's quite wellchoreographed it's stylizedwith slowmotion and framechopping and it's cool. This has some welldone visuals. The FX are reasonable. There is a lot of bloody violence in this. The DVD comes with 8 and a half minutes of behindthescenes footage and four trailers. I recommend this to fans of Asian cinema and John Woo type flicks. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "1st watched 3262009  7 out of 10 DirSiMyung Lee Well done political fantasy thriller from Korea that creates a scenario where Korea in the year 2009 is part of Japan. This happened because a Japanese ambassador wasn't killed in 1909 and the U.S. dropped an atom bomb on Germany instead of Japan who in this film they were allies with in World War II. This madeup history is presented just as the movie begins and then we are introduced to two friends in the Japanse Bureau of InvestigationsJBI for short who are hunting down a terrorist group who basically want Korea to be it's own nation. Initially we think this group is all bad  but the main star played by Toru Nakamura starts uncovering things that bother the JBI. A group that they work closely with houses an artifact that looks kind of like what's on the Korean flag that appears to be the focus of the terrorist group instead of just the terror. He is taken off the assignment because of what he's uncovering and he also starts realizing some things about his own past that link him to this group. The story gets more complicated and bizarre when we find out the artifact has the ability to allow people to time travel. Now I'm not going to tell a lot more because it will ruin the story for those who want to watch it. Despite the movie's length of almost 3 hours it keeps your interest even if you can't speak Koreanas long as you can read the subtitles. The end does take awhile and this is really the only downfall of this otherwise welldone and wellplayed action thriller that also is played out very well. For those interested in good foreign films don't miss this one!!".

A literal example of Gunboat Diplomacy! Too bad some filmmaker doesn't do a time machine movie about freeing Hawaii! But I digress  this could have been a great movie with such an original premise! Alas it was not to be! Instead the constant and graphic showing of heads being blown off makes this a terrorist warporn movie under the guise of Science Fiction! Slaughtering people with cameras carefully lingering over the corpses is not my idea of a good time. If it's yours perhaps you should consider seeing a psychiatrist!This is absolutely the very worst time machine movie ever done. It gives Science Fiction a really bad name and the filmmakers should truly be ashamed of themselves. I will certainly stay clear of any Korean filmmakers in the future!".

A literal example of Gunboat Diplomacy! Too bad some filmmaker doesn't do a time machine movie about freeing Hawaii! But I digress  this could have been a great movie with such an original premise! Alas it was not to be! Instead the constant and graphic showing of heads being blown off makes this a terrorist warporn movie under the guise of Science Fiction! Slaughtering people with cameras carefully lingering over the corpses is not my idea of a good time. If it's yours perhaps you should consider seeing a psychiatrist!This is absolutely the very worst time machine movie ever done. It gives Science Fiction a really bad name and the filmmakers should truly be ashamed of themselves. I will certainly stay clear of any Korean filmmakers in the future!";

LOST MEMORIES uses a more parallel world angle but it's still all about time travel.Don't let the South KoreaJapan collaboration fool you. The film is all South Korean with nearly every single Japanese character coming across as incredibly evil. Cartoonishly so in fact. If not for this I would have given LOST MEMORIES a better grade. AS it stands it's just too cartoonish too crude and too loud for its own good. Also the music is quite terrible.The best part of the film is the leading male who seems to be channeling Chow Yun Fat.

If you're familiar with the history you may find it hard to suspend disbelief about the whole whatif thing. It is predictable so you don't need to pay too much attention to figure out what happens next. Most of time the only thing happening next is a clich or a scene in which the film tries to make the viewer cry. I was so bored that I was crying.I've seen another Korean movie about timetravel.

What I liked about this movie the most was that it has been tried to maintain a realistic mood therefore  all the dialogs that ought have been in Japanese WERE in Japanese.

Being a Lithuanian I can understand Korean because our own nation has been under the influence of Poland for centuries.To put it into account you have to see this movie if you are interested in Asian cinema industry because there is nothing more handsome than an Asian man crying tears run down his face eyes are full of grief and sorrow but not a single face muscle stirs.

	schema:reviewBody "The world of movie superheroes began with Superman thrived with Batman and reached its ultimate apex with SpiderMan. 2002's biggest movie event combines the slam bang roller coaster rush of Batman with the heart sweetness and awshucks sincerity of DC's other titan into a comic book adaptation that is as close to perfect as any will ever come. A joyous blast of post911 American verve crafted with class and a keen eye for storytelling Sam Raimi's 2002 megahit is a onceinalifetime generation defining summer blockbuster and in the eyes of this Generation SpiderManer it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.SpiderMan takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to highflying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here just Marvelfied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach SpiderMan's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect Spider bite wrestling match great power and all that but it also includes unexpectedly an intelligent eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is and how his transformation into SpiderMan can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girlnextdoor Mary Jane Watson Kirsten Dunst is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego the Green Goblin Willem Dafoe. The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential SpiderMan story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wallcrawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure SpiderMan. Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire who was a revelation as Peter Parker SpiderMan. Like Christopher Reeve before him Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid shy dorky and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later teenage anxiety. As SpiderMan he's delightfully charismatic. Lively but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb with a legendary turn from J.K. Simmons as the hardnosed newspaper man J. Jonah Jameson and two measured twinkleintheireyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.But SpiderMan belongs to Sam Raimi. A SpiderMan superfan since childhood Raimi was destined to bring the webslinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring SpiderMan's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's SpiderVerse is! The tone with a precarious balance of largerthanlife action and textured character moments never wavers once. Raimi crafts in SpiderMan a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays the cackling villains the wisecracking heroes and the pedestrians who shout to the skies Look it's SpiderMan! fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. SpiderMan is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg but Raimi adds his own comic book punch a kind of visceral razorsharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal shocking and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when SpiderMan swings through the Manhattan skyline you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior but digital or not every time SpiderMan was on screen I couldn't take my eyes off of it.SpiderMan showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama SpiderMan is an enthusiastic piece of crowdpleasing entertainment a passionate celebration of the SpiderMan mythos and above all a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters especially superhero movies with their all but guaranteed profits can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real An enchanting love story a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. SpiderMan recalls the kind of standupandcheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark KnightAvengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. SpiderMan is not more than a comic book movie but through sheer craftsmanship it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. SpiderMan came together exactly as it should have with exactly the right people at exactly the right time for the country. Seeing this movie in theaters was an experience I will never forget and the film still stands as the standard for what superhero blockbusters can be.95100".

Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire who was a revelation as Peter Parker SpiderMan. Like Christopher Reeve before him Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid shy dorky and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later teenage anxiety. As SpiderMan he's delightfully charismatic. Lively but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb with a legendary turn from J.K. Simmons as the hardnosed newspaper man J. Jonah Jameson and two measured twinkleintheireyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.But SpiderMan belongs to Sam Raimi. A SpiderMan superfan since childhood Raimi was destined to bring the webslinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring SpiderMan's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's SpiderVerse is! The tone with a precarious balance of largerthanlife action and textured character moments never wavers once. Raimi crafts in SpiderMan a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays the cackling villains the wisecracking heroes and the pedestrians who shout to the skies Look it's SpiderMan! fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. SpiderMan is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg but Raimi adds his own comic book punch a kind of visceral razorsharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal shocking and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when SpiderMan swings through the Manhattan skyline you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior but digital or not every time SpiderMan was on screen I couldn't take my eyes off of it.SpiderMan showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama SpiderMan is an enthusiastic piece of crowdpleasing entertainment a passionate celebration of the SpiderMan mythos and above all a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters especially superhero movies with their all but guaranteed profits can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real An enchanting love story a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. SpiderMan recalls the kind of standupandcheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark KnightAvengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. SpiderMan is not more than a comic book movie but through sheer craftsmanship it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. SpiderMan came together exactly as it should have with exactly the right people at exactly the right time for the country. Seeing this movie in theaters was an experience I will never forget and the film still stands as the standard for what superhero blockbusters can be.95100";

	schema:reviewBody "I thoroughly enjoyed SpiderMan which I saw in a screening. I thought the movie was very engrossing.  Director Sam Raimi kept the action quotient high but also emphasized the human element of the story.  Tobey Maguire was very believable as the gawky teenager in the early part of the film and then after his runin with the radioactive genetically engineered spider as the athletic acrobatic superhero of the title. His boyish glee at discovering his new superpowers was infectious and got a lot of laughs.  I also didn't mind the changes to the Peter Parker The Amazing SpiderMan comic book story that the film's writers made e.g. having SpiderMan's web come out of glands in his wrists rather than being an invention of Peter Parker's.  Especially good were Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Aunt May and Uncle Ben Parker Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbornthe Green Goblin James Franco as Harry Osborn and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson.  And in a small but memorable role J.K. Simmons Oz Law  Order as newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson was hilarious.  Perfect casting. I also thought the special effects were very good.  Although I could easily tell when Spidey was a computergenerated image or a stunt double for that matter it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the movie. However I saw the movie with a sixyearold who found the villainous Green Goblin  superbly personified by Willem Dafoe  very very frightening so I would advise against taking children younger than 10 years of age to this movie. The Amazing SpiderMan comic book was a childhood favorite of mine and I can honestly say that Sam Raimi has done it justice!  I'm going to go see this movie again sans terrified sixyearold.".

The computer effects looked badly integrated the Green Goblin's costume looked awful and comic book adaptations usually have such painful scripting and plotting. Thankfully I was wrong on most counts The Goblin still looks rubbish.As it turns out this is probably the best superhero film I've yet seen  certainly up there with Superman and Batman. People seem to automatically comment that the script and acting was bad because they expect it to be the case in these films and indeed it usually is. But if you go into Spiderman without this prejudicial attitude you'll be pleasently suprised. The acting is generally great  there is never a time when anyone is not believable as their character and you think Hey that's an actor not Peter Parker. The effects do look artificial but the pace of the movie means you don't have time to dwell on this and the script is fine! What do people want Shakespearian soliloquies? That would sound incredibly outofplace in modern day New York. There are few of the painful cliches or dreadful dialogue that plague films like The Phantom Menace and the catchphrases like friendly neighbourhood spiderman are fully inkeeping with the character.The comic turns from J.J. Jameson hit the mark the snarling facial contortions of Willem Defoe were suitably evillooking and the conversation with his mirrorimage was a great touch. My only gripe was with the Green Goblin's costume. Very monotone green and not very scary.Allinall a great film that I wouldn't hesitate for a second in recommending.".

I waited an hour in line to see this movie with my friends and I have to tell you that it was completely worth it. This is the crazy movie of the summer but it's one of the best blockbusters to come out of the new millennium. I was never into SpiderMan didn't really know about the story but seeing this movie I think I'm going to take a trip to the comic book store probably.Peter Parker his best friend Harry Osborn and Peter's secret crush Mary Jane Watson visit a genetics laboratory with their high school class. While taking photos in the laboratory Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically engineered super spider. Feeling unwell he passes out shortly after arriving home. Meanwhile scientist and owner of Oscorp Norman Osborn Harry's father is attempting to preserve his company's military contract knowing that its loss will mean the end of his business. He experiments on himself with his company's new but unstable performanceenhancing chemical vapor which increases his speed strength and stamina. However it also causes him to become insane and kills his assistant. The next morning Peter wakes to find that his previously impaired vision has improved and that his body has changed into a more muscular physique. At school he finds himself producing webbing and having the quick reflexes to avoid being injured in a fight with bully Flash Thompson. Peter escapes from the school and realizes that he has acquired spiderlike abilities from the spider bite. He quickly learns to scale walls long jump across building rooftops and swing via webs from his wrists. Norman being ticked off that he didn't get a muscular body he decides to destroy the world! OK that's not exactly the reason but I did sense tension there.I had so much fun watching this movie I can't tell you how many incredible scenes there were I think my favorite was between Norman coming to Thanksgiving dinner and the high tension when he finds out who Spider Man is and the last fight scene between Spider Man and the Green Goblin was awesome! The ending is a cliff hanger so I'm looking forward to seeing the next Spider Man. This was a great movie I highly recommend it SpiderMan has great effects cheesy acting fun one liners and the upside down kiss that will be talked about for generations to come.1010".

With 200 million dollars you can buy  many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content.  If in the process though he decides to forego an entertaining story and script characters that we can get to know and sympathize with and good actors to bring those characters to life all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.  Fortunately for us in bringing Marvel Comic's Spiderman to life Sam Raimi did care about those little details and the audience is richly rewarded because of it.One of the trickier tasks when transferring a film such as Spiderman to film is in giving us enough background story.  If a writer and director spend too much time on the origins of the character it has a tendency to bog the rest of the film down.  Likewise if it is given short thrift we never have a chance to become involved emotionally with the superhero.  In Spiderman Raimi aided immeasurably by Tobey Maguire as Peter ParkerSpiderman strikes just the right note.  Maguire is such an accomplished actor that he immediately establishes Peter Parker as someone we will care about throughout the film.  He has a crush on the beautiful girl next door Mary Jane Watson Kirsten Dunst is constantly harassed by the school jerk and has a best friend Harry  James Franco who's relationship with his father Norman Willem Dafoeis far from perfect.  As for Peter he has an exceptional home life with his Uncle Ben Cliff Robertson and Aunt May Rosemary Harris which is probably one of the reasons Harry develops an early kinship with him.  That and the fact that Harry's father seems to think more of Peter than he does of his own son at times. After having been bitten by a mutated spider Peter awakens one morning to find himself with some exceptional super powers.  He develops muscles that he didn't have before has reflexes Michael Jordan would be proud of and can shoot a web like nobody's business.  It is during these early scenes of discovery by Peter that the film truly excels.  Maguire is like a child whom after taking his first steps learns he can motor about the house quite nicely thank you very much.  We can't help but have as much fun watching Peter Parker hone his skills as he seems to have in being able to do these magnificent feats.Another fine aspect of Spiderman is the love story that develops between Parker and Mary Jane.  As Peter Parker he is never able to quite overcome his inability to tell Mary Jane of his true feelings.  Later as Spiderman there is a wonderful scene between him and Mary Jane in a drenching downpour that any romantic film would envy.Whereas some have not been too enamored of Dafoe's portrayal as Norman OsbornGreen Goblin I found both to be right on the mark.  As Norman we see how his continuous drive to control his company alienates and spoils the relationship he has with his son Harry.  It's not that Norman is an evil person his quest for power has led him to more or less take his son for granted.  Later when after a lab accident it is the schizophrenic battle between the normal Harry and the Evil Harry that brings the Green Goblin to life.  It would have been easy for Raimi to have the lab accident just turn Harry instantly into the Green Goblin but instead we get a richer more dramatic story that we wouldn't have had otherwise.Likewise James Franco who looks enough like Dafoe that they could be father and son is a youth who seems tormented by the fact that no matter what success he achieves his father never gives him his just due.  Kirsten Dunst is also beautiful and charming as Mary Jane.  Her romantic scenes with Spiderman are wonderfully played and she has an especially moving scene with Peter Parker as the film draws to a close.As for the special effects they are indeed spectacular.  As Spiderman swoops between buildings on his web you won't think once that it's not really him doing so.  When reading IMDB reviews of this film or any other film that depends heavily on  special effects one must keep in mind that it has become more or less a hobby among some to downgrade the effects of any film so my advice is to just ignore the criticism in that regard.  The effects here are fine.Two years ago it was with quite a bit of eagerness that I anticipated Raimi's Spiderman film and it lived up to my hopes in every aspect.  If the impending sequel comes even close to being as good as the original it'll be a job well done.  And if a film such as Spiderman can have me counting the days until Spiderman II than I have no choice but to give it my grade which for Spiderman is an A.".

I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment. Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was it was still a disappointment. Spiderman however was everything I was hoping it to be. In fact it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie. Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books. Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains.".

	schema:reviewBody "Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made SpiderMan is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker or SpiderMan portrayed by Tobey Maguire whom after being bit by a radioactive spider he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls shoot web and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the SpiderMan universe the Green Goblin portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly playing a shy kid with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson while giving a great chemistry with her costar. But Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin feeling more like he's suitable for drama instead of action. Rosemary Harris James Franco Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons round up the supporting cast bringing some memorable performances onscreen especially Simmons who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original SpiderMan concept and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch and stay true to the plot. Behind The Dark Knight and The Avengers SpiderMan is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. SpiderMan in my review a refreshing story and exciting action.".

I hadn't seen the film in theaters so this was my first viewing. Definitely entertaining with a good mix of action and budding romance the film of the beginnings of SpiderMan. Although I was a bigger fan of Superman as a kid I also have good memories of the SpiderMan comics and this film is very faithful.no SPOILERS here  The 2 disk DVD set is one of the better ones. The picture itself is extremely sharp and very colorful with a very clear and dynamic Dolby 5.1 sound track. Surround sound complements the picture masterfully so that the viewer seems right in the middle of the action.  POINT  As I have explained in other reviews anyone still watching movies at home on VHS needs to get rid of it now!  It is a different movie on DVD the quality of the picture the quality of the sound not to mention all the extras. With a widescreen TV it is almost like being in a theater.The EXTRAS  In addition to the movie disk one has a feature that pops up a spider icon at certain spots that when clicked jumps you to a brief making of segment for that scene then jumps you back to the movie. Plus there are two different selectable commentaries for anyone who likes the rewatch a movie and hear what went into its making.Disk two is completely devoted to extras like screen tests an HBO special and other aspects of making SpiderMan.  Also included is an archive of SpiderMan comics covers from the 1960s to now grouped by decade and written script to summarize the basic story of each issue. A must have for all Spider Man comics fans.There have been a few user reviews on IMDb usually very short which trash this movie and may even say something like avoid this movie. Be certain those are bogus reviews written for some deceptive purpose I know not why. For anyone who enjoys any kind of fantasy action movie with a good message SpiderMan is a definite mustsee.".

I am very critical of comic book movies since I am a huge fan of the medium and was tremendously disappointed in the Superman and Batman movies all of them some greatly!. This film however has again demonstrated that an adaptation of a comic book story can be  fun and faithful to the story yet be a film for all ages and those who may not have ever even read a comic book.  The Crow was the only other good comic book movie in my opinion but it was not an all ages fun ride as this is!I had the privilege of seeing the film last night 43002 in SF with the press and 300 other folks for its Bay Area Premiere.The acting is the finest portion of the film with the leads giving us depth that I was unsure would be allowed by the style of story chosen.  Maguire was outstanding at being a guy who can rarely catch a break but attract difficulty with ease and aplomb.  He is awkward with the woman he loves but eloquent when dealing with the familiar just as most teenagers are even today.  He gave us wonderful joy at the prospect of web swinging and kicking some much deserved ass!  Dafoe is wonderfully scary as the man who has succumbed to the power games of the corporate  world that drives a decent man mad striving for perfection in himself while trying to hard to please all the wrong people to no avail and then being consumed by guilt that has built over the years of family neglect which finally helps to push him over the edge when an opportunity to make a huge mistake presents itself.The rest of cast is nearly as spectacular with the J.K. Simmons turning in the best performance in the film as J. Jonah Jamason.  When he appeared on screen things lite up even more and he was on fire making everyone in the audience laugh and myself nearly p my pants.  Harris as Aunt May and Robertson as Uncle Ben were excellent choices and gave the film a great deal of its credibility and finesse.  Letting what happens to Ben and Peter I am not telling was wonderful and the best punctuation to what makes Peter do what he does and brings complete credibility to the story.   I am not a huge Dunst fan but she was just fine as the love of Peter Parker's life and a person much like Peter only neither was conscious of the fact.  This to me is a more real version of  true love.The script was far stronger than I expected with some wonderful dialog verbal exchanges solid plot points and pacing.  Many a good parenting lesson can be found in this film as well as interesting thoughts about the choices that we make in life that we might think are no big deal when in the heat of passion but may well come back to haunt us if we don't think before we actspeak which is the trust of the film in my humble opinion.The direction from Raimi was also much better than I anticipated coming from someone who is known and loved for his over the top camp and action.  Many of the fight and action sequences where more over done than I like but they were solid and much like a comic of the Silver Age from whence the story comes so it fit the film fine.  Nice cinematography without the CGI taking over and detracting from the realism in fact it made much of the web swinging truly believable.  A few points made things a bit hard to believe but over all I think most folks will be able to suspend their disbelief.Danny Elfman.  Need I say more?  He is the man when it comes to super hero music and is the closest thing to John Willams and the late great Bernard Herman there is today.  He subtly sets the mood and most of the audience probably doesn't even realize it.  Tomorrow is my day off and I will be purchasing the score to add to my collection!".

Even today 10 years later I still get a thrill out of it and it's a movie that has stayed in my imagination for a long time.It's a great origin story about how Peter Parker Tobey Maguire becomes SpiderMan after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider and becomes a superhero after his Uncle Ben Cliff Robertson RIP is killed by a carjacker. He later battles the Green Goblin who is really Norman Osborn the father of Peter Parker's best friend Harry Osborn James Franco. I still love how the movie ends. Peter is walking away from Mary Jane who has just kissed him and realized that he could be SpiderMan since she kissed SpiderMan earlier in the movie. In a voice over Peter says Whatever life holds in store for me I will never forget these words 'With great power comes great responsibility.' This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm SpiderMan. And it shows SpiderMan swinging through New York City.Tobey Maguire is in my view the best actor to play Peter ParkerSpiderMan yet and accurately captures the awkwardness and caring personality of the character. Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane is great even though I wish she didn't play damsel in distress so much in this movie. My Dad and I joke around about the famous scene where she and SpiderMan kiss each other in the rain with SpiderMan hanging upside down. As for Willem Dafoe who plays the main antagonist Norman OsbornGreen Goblin he is insanely good since he always plays an excellent bad guy and the rest of the cast such as Rosemary Harris James Franco Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons bring their A game. Sam Raimi was an excellent choice for the director since he was a big fan of the SpiderMan comics as a kid. He definitely brought what he knew into the story even though he made some changes in this version. Honestly I don't have a problem with changes he made.I know that because of the new SpiderMan coming out this year fans of that film are hating this movie and the other two and embracing the new one. In all fairness I will always love Sam Raimi's trilogy regardless of how successful the new SpiderMan films are even though I'm looking forward to the new series.10 years later I still give this movie a thumbs up.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPIDERMAN is a stupendous masterpiece of the superhero cinema. It blends action adventure humour emotions thrills and science fiction in a perfect way. Tobey Maguire's wholehearted portrayal of SPIDERMAN is flawless. I remember watching this movie as a very young child and loved every bit of it. Just few weeks ago I rewatched the film in high quality to recall the old good memories of the film as well to enjoy it in the best picture quality. I felt more enthralled and intrigued than earlier. Each and every actor in this film has given an explosive performance. Tobey is undoubtedly very relatable as Peter Parker with whom you won't mind sharing his tears. The way the film's mood turns to a very intense one towards the end his act intensifies. You see him breathe the roles of Peter and Spidey. Willem Dafoe plays an easily menacing antagonist whose actions make him very entertaining. Kirsten Dunst leaves a strong impression as Mary Jane while James Franco too impresses with his cool performance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May very well while it's Cliff Robertson whose portrayal of Ben Parker is very emotional and instantly makes you care and cry for him. And J.K. Simmons do I need to say how great both his acting and comic timing are?The film's action is brilliantly executed and innovative in many ways. Each and every action sequence is explosive and gels perfectly with the screenplay. The film has a lot of classic moments which are still remembered as one of the best ones in a superhero film. The visual effects are phenomenal as is the editing. Sam Raimi's direction makes it a flawless film which feels like one's own story.Finally it's the film's action packed climax and an emotionally resonant ending which proves how every superhero who has superpowers has also many great responsibilities to handle. Seriously a SPIDERMAN movie couldn't have been any better than this.".

	schema:reviewBody "I truly don't know what to say about this movie which got already all possible praises and all possible critics ! But I will write what I canfrom my heart cause my post cannot match any reviews from grammaticalsuper humans and ultra intelligent movie critics ! OK lets start  This movie is directed by one of my favorite film directors Sam Raimi who directed and produced so many good movies and one I love the most is TV series adaptation of Evil Dead also directed by him movie Ash vs Evil Dead which also have mostly positive reviews by top critics. I think ratings go well over 90 on rotten tomatoes ! SpiderMan is supremely made from beginning till end. Every scene is so fresh playful innocent and there is no second of boredom in this one ! I think its the best movie of all movies about Spider Man and they surely knew why Sam Raimi would be perfect man for directing it ! Special effects are just right amount and they don't look artificial at all ! You really have feeling like being part of this world of super heroes and super villains ! So if you wanna movie to look good give it to Spielberg Peter Jackson or Sam Raimi ! In all three cases you cannot miss ! Acting could be flawed but movie will look good ! Cause I really love movies about super heroes with Superman first part being one of my favorite movies ever but I love also Batman and actually all marvel produced world of super heroes including Xmen franchise Nine movies until 2016 Deadpool is really great as well as all others yup I like also those three banned by critics Why I wrote this review in 2016 if movie was made 2002 ? I always loved this movieI guess I would like to support its ratings to go for tiny bit higher ! So for me everything is perfect in this movie  acting effects story scenery for me all this is 1010 ! On of rare movies I can say that without least doubt ! Just one more thing 3rd part of Spider Man from 2007also directed by Sam Raimi was little bit over criticized by movie critics ! I know they know what to write they are not stupid of course but still maybe we became little to spoiled by both mega successful and genius parts before that one 2002 and 2004 cause they said  in this 3rd part problem is there is too much of everything but I think Sam Raimi just wanted to conclude franchise with spectacular finish so in my eyes it was unjustly rated and my rate for all three parts is 1010 without any doubt ! Thank You Sam for so many excellent movies and to make our life more fun !!".

	schema:headline " An Entertaining Superb and Well Executed Superhero Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Bryan Singer's XMen have started getting audiences excited for the modern superhero movies but when Sam Raimi released his first Spider Man outing the expectations bar immediately shot to the stratosphere. Raimi delivered on his promise of an exciting and actionpacked film about Marvel Comic's famous webslinging superhero. We are given the basic origin story of how teenage Peter Parker gains his famous powers after a radioactive spider bites him but we are treated to an engaging narrative as the newly minted hero must contend with his most deadly adversary in the wicked Green Goblin while also contending with normal teenage drama such as an attimes contentious friendship as well as harboring feelings for his pretty neighbor. Stepping into the webslinger's famous costume is the well cast Tobey Maguire who deftly manages to play both the nerdy Peter Parker and courageous Spider Man with equal flair. Despite being nearly thirty years old at the time of filming Maguire's youthful appearance convinces the audience that he resembles a teenager and not a mature young man. Even when inhabiting Spidey's famous suit Maguire displays a youthful machismo mixed with some naivety as Peter is still coming into his element as a superhero but proves himself as fearless when confronted by his emeraldclad nemesis the Green Goblin. While other more seasoned young actors were considered the gamble to go with Maguire paid handsomely as he carries the weight of both average New York teen and crimefighting legend in harmonious tandem.On the opposite side of the board playing the villainous Green Goblin and his unstable alter ego Norman Osbourne is the wickedly delightful Willem Dafoe in one of his most insane roles. When the film starts and Norman is running his successful company Dafoe portrays a fatherly wisdom for young actors Tobey Maguire as Peter and James Franco who plays Norman's son Harry but also shows early signs of the soontobe shattered psyche that will doom Norman to the corruptible power of the Goblin persona the result of a lab accident where Norman tests a powerenhancing drug on himself and kills a fellow scientist in his mania. Once the transformation into an unstable madman begins to take effect Dafoe fully embraces the insanity and goes as over the top as possible utilizing his vocal talents by using a lighter vocal tone for the tormented Norman while using his trademark gravelly sounding voice and a cackling demented laugh for the wicked Goblin without becoming a cartoonish impression of the famous supervillain but as a calculating and dangerous adversary who strikes fear into everyone around New York. Added to the excitement of watching the actor in action is that instead of having a stuntman do the brunt work of maneuvering the Goblin's glider and engaging in fisticuffs with Spider Man is that Willem Dafoe performs his own stunts the actor himself stated the fact in numerous interviews and the filmmakers backed Dafoe's statements. A talented supporting cast rounds out the compelling characters with Kirsten Dunst as Peter Parker's longtime neighbor and love interest Mary Jane Watson James Franco as Peter's best friend Harry Osbourne who happens to be the son of his mortal enemy Rosemary Harris as Peter's beloved Aunt May and cliff Robertson in the role of Uncle Ben who sadly doesn't make it to the halfway mark of the film as comic book fans know well and in a scene stealing role as hotheaded and grouchy boss of the Daily Bugle J. Jonah Jameson is J.K. Simmons in what is one of the character actor's most iconic roles. The film's action sequences are well choreographed and executed from Peter Parker's first attempts to use his enhanced spiderlike abilities to the infamous introduction of the Green Goblin at an Oscorp party to the dynamic final confrontation between Spidey and his emerald nemesis where the fists fly and asskicking just draws the attention in and doesn't relent till a victor is declared. The filmmakers use as little CGI as possible except for Spider Man's webslinging across the city since director Sam Raimi is known for using practical effects in his films. The narrative of the film as mentioned before sets up the main action with the origin of Spider Man when Peter is bitten by the radioactive spider on a field trip with his class and we are given Green Goblin's origin as well with Norman Osbourne's illadvised test of his company's drug on himself that causes him to become the demented villain we love to hate. The story then shifts into the main plot of how Spider Man comes to learn what he must do as a hero to protect his beloved city and loved ones.A truly masterful superhero film that really ushered in the modern superhero craze.".

As for the villainactor William Dafoe was electrifying as Spidey's arch nemesis Green Goblin and the battle between him and our web slinger is something to behold. Even the leading ladyKristen Dunst was not bad as Peter's girlfriend who keeps his identity a secretbut she knows who he is. As the good point of interestthe movie is worth the price of admission. Even if you're a fan of the Marvel comic book or a huge fan of Spidey's cartoon series of Saturday morningsthen this is the ticket to get. Be prepared for the ride of the summersince this one is unbelievable. Kudos to director Sam Raimi for doing this right and finally bringing Spidey to the screen!!!!NOTE There will be two more installments to the SpiderMan trilogy in which Spidey goes up against his greatest enemies like Dr. Octopus Venomand Mystiquo and not to mention the deadliest of them all......

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Sam RaimiWritten by David KoeppStarring Tobey Maguire  Willem Dafoe  Kirsten Dunst and James FrancoAfter years of anticipation and a never ending court battle concerning the legal rights   a big budget cinematic adaptation of the well known comics superhero has finally made it to the movie theaters . First of all I should say I was never much of a Spiderman fan  I have never read comics but is there any person on earth who doesn't know the red clad hero who jumps from building to building ? I doubt so . My only knowledge of Spiderman was some cartoon show where he makes a dynamic trio with Iceman and FireStar . I am not aware of anyone of Spidey's enemies and I was not familiar with his origin and motives . Nevertheless I am keen on comics generally and I always like seeing comics characters materialize on celluloid . So I got really excited when I heard that the project FINALLY got greenlighted and that Sam Raimi eventually took it upon him to shoot the Spiderman motion picture . I will have to admit that most of the comments are 100 right . Spiderman 2002 may not be a GREAT film but it sure is a good one and it beats the hell out of the overrated and disappointing 2000's XMen .I don't think the plot is significant . The movie remains as faithfully to its comics origins as it could be and it satisfies both the hardcore wellknowing fans and the uninitiated like I am . Peter Parker Tobey Maguire is a nerdy 17 year old student   not much accepted by his social environment and constantly being picked by his bullies classmates . He has a secret crush on the beautiful girl next door Mary Jane M.J.' Watson Kirsten Dunst but she hardly knows he exists . When he is bitten by a mutated super spider he is bestowed with special powers like climbing on windows with his bare albeit sticky hands  ejecting spider nets from his arms  incredible acrobatic agility and enhanced dangerapproaching instinct. While he tries to adjust to his newly obtained powers he finds himself caught in a war that a fiendish super criminal called the Green Goblin has declared against him . The Green Goblin is a maniac who wreaks havoc and kills innocent people using military equipment and weaponry . He believes that SpiderMan is the only real threat and wants to bring him down . The Green Goblin is actually the alterego of Norman Osborn Willem Dafoe a very wealthy businessman  scientist who has started developing a split personality and the deranged Green Goblin becomes more and more dominant driving him to madness . Norman's son is Harry James Franco who coincidentally is Peter's best friend and classmate . So SpiderMan will try to stop the Green Goblin before he kills more civilians and simultaneously will try to get Mary Jane's attention .That's it folks . The film spends much more time on the love story between Peter and Mary Jane and less on action . I always like character development and human relationships unfolded in superhero films but a little more action wouldn't heart either . Basically we see SpiderMan beat up some random thugs on alley streets and that's it . The balloon sequence in the middle of the film is nice but awfully reminiscent of Batman 1989 . I wish there were more epic battles between Spiderman and Green Goblin with more explosions . Some other things I didn't like either were 1 Even worse CGI SFX than the robot soldiers in the Phantom Menace !!! I never thought it could happen but here it is . The shots of SpiderMan in the beginning of the film jumping from the top of a building to another is a lame cartoon that will not convince even a 3 year old viewer . I cannot describe how laughable and fake this Spiderman cartoon is  you will have to see for yourselves .2 The acting is average from all the actors . None of them manages to deliver fully the dramatic depth of the characters as scripted by the writer. The worst performance belongs to Willem Dafoe . His mirror communication scene was nicely scripted but Dafoe is extremely bad and unconvincing . What exactly happened here ? I liked him in Body of Evidence and Speed II but his talents seem to have been erased in this film . I will have to admit that some of the Green Goblin's lines gave me the creeps but can anyone assure me that it was really him under the suit or his voice for that matter ? Maguire's  and Dunst's acting is better but still mediocre . Speaking of the duo  one other flaw is that they don't have enough chemistry together like Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder . If they made a more fitting pair the screen time spent in their romance would be more worthily used . And if James Franco has the most impact screen presence is because his character requires for him to sit back and look calm and cool and it is obvious that's the reason why they cast him . The secondary characters like Peter's uncle and aunt act OK but that newspaper editor was too annoying to like him.3 The Green Goblin is never developed and is not much of a formidable foe . Maybe it was intentional to give him little screen time in order not to pull another scenestealer a la Joker and give all the focus on SpiderMan . Unfortunately a great action film always needs a powerful evil character to be the opposition AND the driving force for the hero's existence .Aside from these flaws the movie has all the features of a good blockbuster . The red suit of SpiderMan is faithful and really convinces us that the character has come to life ! There are some good scenes like the one where Peter finally beats up one the bullies in school . My favorite scene in the movie is a great surprise and that's why I cannot give it away. All I can say if you haven't watched the film  is the sequence where the Green Goblin sings The itsy  bitsy spider.' . I also digged the final duel between SpiderMan and Green Goblin . Without being too violent it is an exciting fight  largerthanlife and worth our money . I just wish the rest of the movie reached the same adrenaline levels . Despite a lackluster performance  Tobey Maguire was perfectly cast as Peter Parker . He suits the geeky looks the character has and convinces as a 17 year old with continually growing power physical and personal . The film has an obvious open end as a set up for the sequel .

We follow Peter Parker from the very beginning . We have a taste of his life before the drastic change occurs and then we have the transformation in front of our eyes full play !

But Raimi's SpiderMan is unique  we SEE Peter Parker training with his super powers  trying to control them and we even get to see him pick his costume . Now I will keep my reservations because I have yet to see the recent batch of Marvel comicbook adaptations like Daredevil or Hulk but for now SpiderMan is the best introducing film you will find .

Peter is just 17 and as much as he is supposed to be a science genius he wouldn't have the money or the technology to invent some synthetic web shooters . The Green Goblin outfit sure looks like a Power Ranger suit but it is also realistic as it is a piece of military equipment and not a Halloween costume . New York City is depicted as a shiny town and establishes a truly existing environment for the story to take place .SpiderMan 2002 for all its weaknesses is a good film with some of the best narrative I have seen . The voiceovers by Maguire help us identify with him even more . The film is better than some other comic book flicks like Phantom or Spawn not entirely their fault since these characters are less appealing and therefore less known Dick Tracy  The Mask or the Shadow good idea but mediocre script  execution or over hyped blockbusters like the XMen . It will not be a classic like Superman II or Batman but it is one of the best of the bunch of the comicbook' genre .

	onyx:emotionText "Directed by Sam RaimiWritten by David KoeppStarring Tobey Maguire  Willem Dafoe  Kirsten Dunst and James FrancoAfter years of anticipation and a never ending court battle concerning the legal rights   a big budget cinematic adaptation of the well known comics superhero has finally made it to the movie theaters . First of all I should say I was never much of a Spiderman fan  I have never read comics but is there any person on earth who doesn't know the red clad hero who jumps from building to building ? I doubt so . My only knowledge of Spiderman was some cartoon show where he makes a dynamic trio with Iceman and FireStar . I am not aware of anyone of Spidey's enemies and I was not familiar with his origin and motives . Nevertheless I am keen on comics generally and I always like seeing comics characters materialize on celluloid . So I got really excited when I heard that the project FINALLY got greenlighted and that Sam Raimi eventually took it upon him to shoot the Spiderman motion picture . I will have to admit that most of the comments are 100 right . Spiderman 2002 may not be a GREAT film but it sure is a good one and it beats the hell out of the overrated and disappointing 2000's XMen .I don't think the plot is significant . The movie remains as faithfully to its comics origins as it could be and it satisfies both the hardcore wellknowing fans and the uninitiated like I am . Peter Parker Tobey Maguire is a nerdy 17 year old student   not much accepted by his social environment and constantly being picked by his bullies classmates . He has a secret crush on the beautiful girl next door Mary Jane M.J.' Watson Kirsten Dunst but she hardly knows he exists . When he is bitten by a mutated super spider he is bestowed with special powers like climbing on windows with his bare albeit sticky hands  ejecting spider nets from his arms  incredible acrobatic agility and enhanced dangerapproaching instinct. While he tries to adjust to his newly obtained powers he finds himself caught in a war that a fiendish super criminal called the Green Goblin has declared against him . The Green Goblin is a maniac who wreaks havoc and kills innocent people using military equipment and weaponry . He believes that SpiderMan is the only real threat and wants to bring him down . The Green Goblin is actually the alterego of Norman Osborn Willem Dafoe a very wealthy businessman  scientist who has started developing a split personality and the deranged Green Goblin becomes more and more dominant driving him to madness . Norman's son is Harry James Franco who coincidentally is Peter's best friend and classmate . So SpiderMan will try to stop the Green Goblin before he kills more civilians and simultaneously will try to get Mary Jane's attention .That's it folks . The film spends much more time on the love story between Peter and Mary Jane and less on action . I always like character development and human relationships unfolded in superhero films but a little more action wouldn't heart either . Basically we see SpiderMan beat up some random thugs on alley streets and that's it . The balloon sequence in the middle of the film is nice but awfully reminiscent of Batman 1989 .

After Spiderman's release in 2002 and its sequels in 2004 and 2007 we saw the Dark Knight movies Thor Captain American Iron Man etc. Without this movie many people in these superhero films would not have careers. Unlike the cartoons and comics this is slightly different version of Spiderman with a different story. Why did they change? Dramatic purposes were needed. See the 2012 reboot to see why. A nerdy Peter Parker gets bitten by a spider at a high school science field trip and develops radical powers. Although still timid and softspoken he gains confidence and tries to win over Mary Jane Watson his lifelong crush. Meanwhile Norman Osborne's most recent Oscorp experiment goes drastically wrong and develops a vicious alteregothe Green Goblinwho Peter must stop.Anybody that says the 2012 reboot beats this either thinks Andrew Garfield is hot andor are hardcore comic fans that don't understand how movies work. Tobey's Peter Parker is kind caring likable hardworking and mysterious that can't seem to catch a break. Mary Jane is sweet has high hopes is popular and comes from a bad home. Norman Osborne is emotionally destructive and tortured by his other personality Green Goblin. This Green Goblin is freaking scary yet funny villain that hasn't yet been topped. Well Heath Ledger did. The Love story is original and better than the new one. In this Peter keeps himself a mystery from Mary Jane yet is still her emotional comfort who is always there. The new one is just him getting the girl right away and developing chemistry. The hero doesn't get the girl in this? That is originality. This movie is also very unforgettable.Tobey is so much better than Garfcat. For one he doesn't have a stupid haircut. For another he is smart but the whole movie isn't just Peter doing science experiments and trying to find out about his parents. Peter is also more muscular and looks like a superhero type while Garfield is just skin and bones. Peter is developed so well in this we feel his exact moods. Garfield's weren't bad but not good. Tobey wasn't disrespectful to anybody like Garfield was throughout the whole movie. Tobey was more deserving of his powers. Tobey's Spider powers being internal makes him more of a superhuman. Garfield's discovery of his powers were so stupid. Garfield wined a lot more than Tobey did. This Peter was constantly changing throughout the whole movie Garfield stayed the same. Tobey pulled off the geek persona while Garfield failed at a geek trying to be cool. Tobey's Spiderman delivers funny oneliners while fighting villains while Garfield breaks out into extremely stupid 10 minute songs and dances. Garfield gives up hunting his uncle's killer. Garfield only saved what 2 people? And caused that death of Gwen's father. Tobey saved many people throughout the whole movie and causes no deaths. Sorry for so many comparisons. It's a dirty job but somebody had to do it!".

Marvel comics Stan Lee adjusted the idiom slightly to make the mythology more accessible and at the same time make each panel more active. He also popularized the overlapping of static panels on the page so that not only was each panel composed but each assembly of panels.Pulling on those two poles the mythology and the framing must be done simultaneously. By focusing more and more on the framing of the art it allowed the referenced mythical power to increase. In other words by making the images more static the story became more dynamic and thus stronger. What made Spidey so novel was that his superhero action is primarily one of swooping and perching on oddly perspectived surfaces.So this particular comic Spiderman provides a much richer basis for effective film art than any other because it has a unique blend of framing and swooping. To appreciate the opportunity you need to know one of the most lasting and interesting controversies in the film world.Moving' pictures were seen as a sibling to still' pictures which themselves inherited much from easel art. Similar equipment and conventions applied. All early movies placed the camera at eye level on a stationary tripod. The movement was one that a normal human observer would see. A secondorder movement was introduced and mastered by Eisenstein the movement of the camera from one shot to another. The individual shots were still from a stationary camera but there was a choreography of the eye introduced. The setup of each shot was still essentially composed like a photo rather like a comic panel in fact. The master of that today in film is Greenaway but successful hacks like Speilberg mine what's been done. In fact folks like Speilberg compose their films first as comics storyboards and then replicate the frames.But there emerged a new school led by Hitchcock that had the camera moving while the action moved. By controlling those moves Hitch's camera had personality curiosity. Tarkovsky and later dePalma mastered this and innovated so that some rare films have the eye as a main character. Today essentially every filmmaker has a swooping camera because heshe can and because composing the EisensteinKurosawa way requires insight beyond the skills of the current crop. So we now have a community of swoopers mostly inept constantly copying.So you can see how I got my hopes up. The Spiderman material was rooted in clever framing like EisensteinKurosawa  it is no accident that Peter Parker is the photographer of Spiderman.But it also depends on referencing and exploiting the swooping eye as with TarkovskydePalma. It also makes heavy use of the oddangled architecture of Welles which clearly spilled more from his films into comics than into successor films.But what we get is a depressingly unoriginal treatment wholly unaware of either the grand possibilities or even the educated eye. This is not just a pedantic concern  you cannot have an exciting movie without an exciting eye. And this film's eye is hidden behind an inanimate mask. This is the Goblin's movie not Spidey's".

	schema:headline " Stylish yet somewhat disappointing!";
	schema:reviewBody "Being an avid fan of the comic book I really looked forward to this movie and for a long time I convinced myself that I liked the film. However after a long time of self denial I bought the SpiderMan DVD and I saw the film for what it truly was. A disappointment. The magic from the comic books had evaporated.The acting in the film is a mixed bag. Tobey Maguire is well cast but his overall acting and presence isn't very good. He does the nerd part very well but when it comes to being a super hero he falls short. SpiderMan was always a complex character with great internal struggles but the film medium doesn't convey this very well because we don't get the inner monologue that SpiderMan is so well known for. He therefore has to act with facial expressions and body language. Tobey has a pretty well defined body language but his facial expressions are somewhat lacking. Also the fact that he is wearing the SpiderMan suit in many scenes prevent us from clearly reading what is going on in his head at the moment. Kirsten Dunst is just miscast. She is a horrible actress with zero talent and no resemblance with the character she plays making her performance utterly unbelievable. Willem Dafoe is usually a brilliant actor but in SpiderMan he seems to have dumbed down quite a bit and although his schizophrenic scenes are pretty interesting they do not cover for the fact that this is Dafoe's most mediocre performance in years. James Franco who plays Harry Osborn is remarkably boring in his performance. His voice never seems to change making him a young Keanu Reeves. The most interesting and well cast actor is J.K. Simmons who plays J. Jonah Jameson and if there was ever a guy who looked like the character he is meant to play it is Simmons. This is in both looks voice and presence.The overall effects in the movie are undoubtedly very good and this makes the action sequences seem more believable. SpiderMan was nominated for an Oscar in the effects department but deservedly the Oscar went to The Fellowship of the Ring because while the effects are good they are far from brilliant. I will even go as far as to say that the only really good effects scene is the one at the very end where SpiderMan swings through the city. This scene however almost saves the film because it is brilliant and it is the only scene I can watch again and again.Danny Elfman's score is very good and it really suiting for a super hero movie. It really shows that Elfman has done a super hero movie score before. I am of course referring to Batman which is undoubtedly one of the best scores ever and you can certainly feel that Elfman used some of the experiences from that film in SpiderMan. The score has an epic feel to it that suits the film very well. The music is beyond reproach.Where the film fails is in the fact that it is too proper and it feels too much like it was adapted for kids which is in my opinion a mistake because the film had tremendous potential but it seems wasted because it never really becomes an adult film. Also the ending on the bridge is based on a well known story in the SpiderMan mythology where SpiderMan's first love Gwen Stacy dies in SpiderMan's battle with Green Goblin. I think they should have brought on Gwen Stacy for the first film and then introduced Mary Jan in the second movie. because it would have given SpiderMan a greater sense of loss and a better reason to hate Green Goblin if his first love had died at his hands but instead Raimi plays it safe and has SpiderMan save both the children in the lift and Mary Jane. It just seems too stupid.All in all SpiderMan was not the movie I was hoping for. I expected the best film ever and it certainly didn't deliver. Having said that and having seen the film a couple of times on DVD now I have grown to appreciate it a bit more. My primary issue with the film is that seems that the film wasn't directed for the fans of the character who expected a better adaptation but instead the film becomes a main stream Blockbuster with a wide range which isn't necessarily a bad thing but being a hardcore SpiderMan fan I would have liked to see a more adult film. SpiderMan is a good effort though and the effects alone deserve to be watched.710".

Many observers were curious as to the secret to its success. Was it because of the gangsters? the actors?The main reason for this movie's phenomenal success was the fact that is was a very good movie about male friendship. In Korean culture friendship between guys is a very strong relationship. Especially in the city in which the movie is set  Pusan  loyalty and sacrifice for friendship is seen as a very important part of honour.In this movie friendship is tested to the limit from beginning to end as the movie's two main leads Yoo Oh Sung and Jang Dong Gun grow from being teenage rebels to bigtime gangsters. The catch is when they grow up they become very different types of gangsters. One becomes a JOPOK  equivalent to the Korean Mafia respected by the Korean people for sometimes punishing bad people. And the other becomes more of a thug gangster who kills and steals for fun.The direction is excellent but the acting is the element which holds the film together as a whole. The two leads are two very different actors. The first Yoo OhSung plays the Mafia gangster and has a very toughasnails look and uses method acting skills. The second arguably Korea's most popular actor right now chews scenery with Chow Yun Fatlike charisma and striking looks.if you enjoy gangster movies or movies about friendship this will be a dream movie for you".

	schema:reviewBody "I am surprised and encouraged by the quality films I've seen out of Korea. Chingoo is a touching firstperson story about 4 boyhood friends and the way their lives unfold from carefree boyish cluelessness to the inevitable.There are flashy chaoticviolent films like Pulp Fiction which become instant cult classics because they are not chaotic at all but crafted immaculately. But the characters in Pulp Fiction are just that unreal comicbook lowlives who inadvertently display a few human characteristics while going about their destructive pulpfiction lives.Chingoo comes from the other direction although it too is crafted superbly. No flash. Instead of the cool junkie Vincent portrayed by John Travolta Joonsuk ably evokes a glimpse of the personal hellworld of addiction...and later wryly comments that he found the will to clean up after he saw he was losing ground in the gangster corporate hierarchy. Very much the CEO material. Yes he coulda been a corporate contendah.and 500 years earlier he would have been the Korean equivalent of a Samurai daimyoif only..These are real human characters growing up in a society that is rigidly disciplined yet dynamic and their paths take them literally on an escalator of fate to adulthood with just a whimsical struggle of will by Joonsuk the protagonist the main toughguy. He evokes the late Lee Strasberg's famous line from The Godfather These are the lives we've chosen in the stolidity with which he accepts the horror of being a gangster. But he's a better man than the Godfather or the Pacino Godfather. He shows loyalty goes both ways.Thirty minutes after Pulp Fiction you're hungry in fact there's no story to digest at all. It's a fairytale as it intends. Chingoo sticks to your ribs spoiler pun by building real characters and taking real themes and hinting at issues that torment great men. Unfortunately the film is true to the clime and there are no great women characters. I suppose that's true of the Godfather too. Gangsters just aren't chickflick material.Chingoo delivers a supposedly autobiographical story by the director which tells me yet again that life is stranger realer better than pulp fiction. Well worth viewing.".

Mr. Kwak is capable to tell the story of four friends on such an intimate level because it was based very much on his own personal experiences. The story is extremely genuine and it holds so much water for anybody who has ever witnessed the people that they love ruin their lives. It certainly comes straight from the heart of Kwak and while watching it it is hard not to become emotional as you see the film being developed.I also found the film to be made very professionally with some great camerawork and never once did I feel that the production was subpar. A lot of the camera work is well executed. Overall the dialogue and story are very powerful and the calm reflective nature of the film makes it easy to watch. I enjoyed this film very much.

Directorwriter Kyungtaek Kwak proves himself a major force in Korean cinema and I'm sure has even ruffled the feathers of the great Chanwook Park with this one well maybe not ruffled as Park has since directed Mr. Vengeance Oldboy Lady Vengeance and I'm a Cyborg But That's OK and Kwak has fallen to Typhoon. That all said at least we know he has it in him even if it was just a fluke. Certainly the best Asian film of 2001. 9 of 10 stars.".

It is a gangster movie but focus more on the characters and their friendship. Dongsu a quite tragic and antihero character with no elegance and glory is opposite of what audience would expect if they are used to a regular Hong Kong style ganster film.

	schema:headline " Sometimes this works";
	schema:reviewBody "When director Kwak Kyung Taek works portions of this film as period pieces the results are nothing short of spectacular beauty. Scenes depicting 1976 and 1981 alone are worth the price of this film.Sadly the broader story of friendship gone awry is bogged down by clichs and melodrama and stereotypical gangster character faux angst. The plot is incidental to the message that Kwak tries to convey with this film pure and innocent youthful friendship can be undone by the broader but ultimately less important adult world concerns of lust greed and power. Indeed the plot has been so often done that there is no need to relate it in this review. Suffice it to say that two young friends become as adults underworld gangster rivals in Pusan South Korea with plenty of that old standby bloodshed thrown in.The beauty of Friend starts when two friends Joon Suk and Dong Su along with two other friends who don't become gangsters try to examine sex as kids. In an amusing scene the group confuses the word menstruation with vagina. This leads to some hilarity for viewers later as the sexcrazed kids go about typical early teenage shenanigans.Similarly much later in the film a precious scene unfolds when one of the nongangsters visits the lair of one of his gangster friends and while engaging in friendly banter asks him why he as a gangster speaks of philosophy when he is but a hoodlum. The gangster's henchmen get itchy a la The Godfather and the gangster instead of killing or torturing his friend humiliates his own henchmen for overreacting by placing them in compromising positions in a car trunk. How dare you suspect my friend and guest he spits at his erstwhile protectors.Such portrayals of true friendship predominate until the last quarter of the film when the rivalry between the two former friends the gangsters erupts into stereotypical overthetop violence reminiscent of DePalma and Pacino. And while these latter scenes are apparently meant to provide the purpose and meaning of Friend they come off as clichd shootemups filled with hohum dialogue and predictably tense scenes that come up disappointing.Still Kwak displays instances of brilliance such as when he portrays the rebellious underworld of South Korea in 1981 under Chun Doo Hwan's military dictatorship. Women smoking cigarettes was taboo even when I visited the country more than a decade later. Kwak is able to depict subtle scenes of rebellion in a subtle manner and these are the gems of the film that resonate A stunning performance by a female rock band. A running away scene with Robert Palmer's Bad Case of Loving You blaring in the soundtrack. A West Side Story type brawl in a theater while a government propaganda newsreel runs in the background. Shades of Quadrophenia and Romper Stomper prevail throughout the early half of the film and when they do its scenes are effectively cut with enough humorous interludes that a viewer does not want the film to progress into the epic saga that it eventually tries with limited success to become.Former friends Joon Suk and Dong Su become reluctant adversaries and Kwak attempts to use this setting as a vehicle for a commentary on friendship. It works if your idea of friendship is apologizing to your best friend as he dies at your hand or if confessing to that murder to face a certain death penalty qualifies as redemption. After a lot of violence and prisoncell soulsearching the film concludes with a sentimental look back at the halcyon days of the friendly boys' respective childhoods. In this reviewer's opinion it doesn't work. What does work is Kwak's initial representation of the boys' coming of age. If he had stayed there this film could have been a lovely revelry in the ridiculous and absurd world of happily ignorant boyhood.Instead Kwak tries for a home run when all the friends really need is a base hit.".

Among friends there is no hatred or bitterness only forgiveness understanding and support.The acting is second to none. Both the lead and the supporting actors won the best acting awards at an international film festival. When the murderous and treacherous friend becomes himself murdered it is a profoundly sad moment. Then we realize that we have come to love and care for the characters despite their flaws because we come to respect them as human beings capable of deep and profound friendship unlike any other.Finally the director did an incredible job of enhancing the allure of the main female character.

	schema:reviewBody "If there were a movie out that resembled my story style it would be this one. I guess to that credit i gave it some unfair bias The elements of the story are like most of mine Good setup and character development at beginning Wanes a bit in the middle Awesome End Underlying message trying to be conveyedThis is a beautifully told story and the fact that's its based upon the director's true life makes it better.My only complaint is the lack of development on the shrimpy character. THe movie starts out displaying the FOUR friendships and develops on that really well. Yet near the middle of the movie the focus seems to be on the two gangsters and the narrator. It may be bc that's how it was in reality but the fourth character I thought needed to given more of the story at least fictional roles just for balancing purposes.Other than a few carping details I loved the film.The end owns and the quote from the beginning is quite relevant. The whole story displays LIFE and has reinforced what i believe life accounts  Memories. It is a series of memories and a series of moments that truly touches the heart and will perhaps make you realize memories of your own and how important and effective they are.810".

FRIEND was a big hit at home but it's certainly nothing special. The only thing that makes the movie stand out are the terrific performances by all involved and the cinematography is just gorgeous. But for something original go somewhere else. Then again if you've never seen a Jopok movie before FRIEND might seem really original to you.7 out of 10go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this movie and reviews of other foreign films".

With peaceful music playing in the background it feels as if the film is in the same nostalgic realm as Rob Reiner's Stand By Me. This feeling is given even more of a jolt when the viewer is introduced to four young protagonists Sangtaek Joonsuk Dongsu and Joongho. Although from vastly different backgrounds Sangtaek is uppermiddleclass Dongsu's father is a mortician Joonsuk's father is a gangster etc. the boys form a strong friendship and spend their days swimming asking each other outlandish questions buying menstruation pictures menstruation being the word used by adults for female genitalia and watching porn.The friends are split up when they enter junior high school but are reunited in high school. Enduring such individuals as their English teacher who not canes students on their bare feet when they cannot answer questions correctly but who also slaps and punches them the boys feel the pangs of first love Joongho for the keyboardist of the all girl band Rainbow and Dongsu and Sangtaek for Rainbow's lead singer Jinsook. However it is at this point a small breach forms in the relationship between Dongsu and Joonsuk. Joonsuk arranges for Sangtaek to go to a private room with Jinsook while Dongsu is left out in the cold. After Dongsu asks Joonsuk if he is nothing more than a henchman Joonsuk fails to give an answer.After a major fight in a movie theater which pitted the four friends against what seemed to be an entire school the gang of four is split and Joonsuk and Dongsu entrench themselves deeper into the criminal underworld while Sangtaek and Joongho pursue their own goals. Sangtaek and Joongho meet Joonsuk a few years later but the once hardasnails gang leader has been reduced to a drugaddled wreck. However after yet another long duration of time the friends meet again and Joonsuk is at the top of his game. Dongsu is also at the top of his game as well as the second in a rival gang.Threaded thickly with nostalgia Friend will move anyone who reminisces about childhood friends. Although from completely different backgrounds the friendship between Sangtaek and Joonsuk radiates deeply. Joonsuk's protective nature is almost frightening because of his almost dual personality of ruthless brute and a caring friend. While filled with violence and blood in my humble opinion the comedic interactions between the four men truly make Friend a good if not outstanding movie.".

The movie of course is good. It becomes the most money making film in Korean history and won many awards including Jang donggun's best supporting actor in Asian film festival. It is a gangster movie but focus more on the characters and their friendship. Dongsu a quite tragic and antihero character with no elegance and glory is opposite of what audience would expect if they are used to a regular Hong Kong style gangster film. With Jang donggun's performance Dongsu's suppressed rage and sadness were effectively but delicately shown though ruthless in mob confrontations the audience would still feel sympathetic and mourn for his inevitable death. Besides Jang donggun everything else is also excellent the photography the story the directing styles other actors especially Yu ohseong who also won the best actor award in Asian film festival who play Jeongsuk.".

The story ultimately fails to convince. In spite of the praise heaped upon this film from other viewers this is a story so dripping in emotional content it is laid on far too thick the movie ultimately becomes an overly romantic take on malebonding. One could also view Friends as an allegory on the NorthSouth Korean divide. In spite of terrible violence in the past the two Koreas share an inseparable bond or so the allegory might suggest.

Dongsu always want to be at the same position of Joonsuk.

	schema:headline " I can't kill him with lung cancer !!";
	schema:reviewBody "This story is about 4 assassins who only kill when someone wants another person dead. They do not kill unnecessarily because you realized in the movie they don't go around gunning everyone down just to kill the main target.There are many funny scenes in the movie. Some people don't find it funny because its not visual slapstick comedy. The humor is contained in the dialogues.For example Jaeyeong sniper goes to the church regularly to confess his sins. He told the priest that he killed 5 people this week and the priest was speechless for a while.. then he consoled the sniper saying 5 is only a team of basketball players.Jungwoo demolition man always gets the difficult assassination jobs. He can't bring himself to kill a pregnant woman. In the ending of the movie he was tasked to kill a man only by lung cancer and not bullets. The argument between Sangyeon big brother of the group and him on killing someone with lung cancer is very funny.In case you didn't understand why the cop did not arrest the 4 assassins. The cop made use of them to kill the villain of the movie. Earlier in the movie the cop sneaked into the assassins' house and stole some bullets. The cop also used the villain's confiscated car to let them copy down the suspicious license plate number. The stolen bullet was used to shoot Sangyeon. While Sangyeon was unconscious the rest of the 3 assassins assumed it was the job of that suspicious car that followed them earlier. They went out to gun down the people driving the car and the main villain happened to be inside the car. The main villain escaped legal punishment many times and the law cannot do anything to him. The cop therefore made use of the assassins in the name of 'justice'.The 'matrix slow motion' style of the sniper's bullet may look cheesy or insignificant now because we have seen so many such effects in movies these days. However please bear in mind that this movie was made in 2001. During that time this matrix bullet effect is considered very cool and well done.The music tracks are very fitting in the scenes. Well done by the sounds department.Mao points 810".

I haven't watched the dubbing yet but I love the subtitles. Plainly wonderful absolutely amazing.How the 4 main characters care for each other is unbelievable especially the relationship between Sangyun and Hayun is just too adorable.

The movie is cleverly structured vaguely reminiscent of Korean classic MY SASSY GIRL and beautifully filmed.

So when they aren't killing anyone they talk about crushes job satisfaction modern trends just about all the same things everyone else talks about. At first it's quirky and amusing but all too quickly the semiwitty banter grows wearisome and the audience is left hoping they will get back to the killing as soon as possible.Technically speaking the film is better than average. Acting filming editing all pretty good but the script is a soreeye. Not that the writing is bad just that is doesn't really go anywhere or do anything these guys won't stop talking but they never really say anything.One can only watch these guys slumming and acting cool just so much before it grows dull...which it does long before the film ends I'm afraid.610".

Of course eventually their lifestyle leads to complications with the police as well as their targets. That said the film's story is rather scattered and it's hard to figure out what the story is about in a larger sense. The characters at least three of them do undergo growth and development and the story does move forward as their jobs take them into the aforementioned conflicts but I guess my issue with the story is that there is no real overarching themes.There are two points where this film is impressive1. Style When this film decides to flex its stylistic muscles it can be quite stylish. In fact part of the joy of the film is watching how genre styles can be upturned as crime collides with comedy. But when the film is trying to pull cool it does. There are a few amusing and enjoyable applications of split screen and some amusing use of alternate reality scenes as well.2. Comedy I really found myself quite amused during this film actually breaking out into laughter on many occasions. Even though the overall story is a little unfocused the comedy is tight and appreciable. The setups are great the payoffs are amusing and everything is rooted in the situation and the characters.So the film does have some considerable overall story issues due to the unfocused script but the film does well enough in comedy and in putting together some suspense that it still remains surprisingly enjoyable despite its obvious flaws. As such I can recommend it as an enjoyable film but can't really compare it to similar hybrids by Guy Ritchie or Quentin Tarantino. You should think of it more as a comedy featuring four assassins. Good stuff. 810.".

It simply reflects on the human side of the professional killers and it mellows your heart out if you are a diehard fan of violence or a gore fan.

It simply reflects on the human side of the professional killers and it mellows your heart out if you are a diehard fan of violence or a gore fan. The hamlet scene is quite original i think and although the thriller part of the film is less than abundant there is enough to keep it entertaining.7.4 because the killers are humans after all.";

And one of the coolest special effects I've seen For the people how saw the movie Bullet in the parking garage...... The movie also has some funny moments. But I don't think the subtitles are as funny as the spoken language at least that's what I was toldI really enjoyed the movie and for people that enjoy tarantino without most of the violence will enjoy this movie.".

This is one Asian version of it less off beat more to the mild side and violence is not glorified however candy flossed. My only mistake is that i actually purchased this film on DVDbelieving that this film is as good as its rave i set an extremely high expectation  take Sharkskin man and peach hip girl 1998  i was expecting heaps too out of that one  and boy i wasnt the least dissapointed that film rocks the boat! OK so i was giving a ball park estimation that this film  gonna go in the tradition of Sharkskin man lots of wacky characters with killer suits a rocking fast and furious action and off beat dialogues.... hmmm... i guess it doesnt work that way. This views more like those Hongkong films  where every people under 30 are at their peak of hipness and being a killer doesnt stop you from having a well groomed haircut.... anyway....yeah. I'll cut it short this film goes around 100 minutes or so  i haven't manage to finish the whole film but i'm up to the 90 minutes something and i'm guessing that there won't be any twist or a major resolution whatsoever here we are presented with 4 pretty boy type dudes who seems having quite alot of fun on  doing their job offing people naturally with this kind of film the characters have to be unique one have to play the mysterious sniper whilst theres the usual wild but wacky lad and then theres the leader ah yes lastly but not least  the youngest pretty boy who  isn't allowed to handle guns yet  he also acts as the narrator of the story. Two of the characters the Leader of the quartet and his younger brother the junior are played by Korean leading Music video models i forgot whats his name  but he plays the killer in Bi Chun Mo1999   and the youngest  played by Teen heart Throb Won Bin. You get the usual bullet time scene and some slow mo running and others that you wont be too surprised off if you seen the movies i mentioned above. This is an ok film more well produced than your average straight to VCD hong kong films  a neat scene of an assasination act within the parrarels of Shakespeare's Hamlet occurs here. 3 out of 5 stars.".

In Ming dynasty the kingdom of Korea was under sovereign of China. The emperor o China declared Korea as a kingdom which China would never fight with. Actually in 16 century Japan invaded Korea and it was China helped them to win the war. This war cost the Ming dynasty a lot which was one of the reasons of its fall. And after its fall into Qing dynasty the kingdom of Korea was still loyal to Ming and kept using the era name of the last emperor of Ming internally till 19 century 3. Gunpowder was invented in China and already equipped in the army as early as in 11 century. In Ming dynasty they even had an army equipped with guns and cannons which was called Divine Engine Division Shen Ji Shin Ge Ying the first two characters are same as this movie's title and the last one means division. It's hard to believe they didn't show any of this in this movie.I could understand Korea proud of their nation and achievement but this should not be based on screwed history.".

The Inventor is killed but his daughter escapes and helps continue the work on the weapons. There are many difficulties in the development they must get the ingredients to make the gun powder and they still need the calculations. Inevitably the two sides will eventually meet in battle and the new weapons will finally be tested.While this might not be historically accurate that didn't affect my enjoyment of the film... perhaps because I don't know much about Korean history. The story is interesting with plenty of exciting moments leading up to a fairly spectacular final battle. As well as some impressive close quarters fighting we see two fearsome weapons deployed one that uses rockets to fire hundreds of arrows and great range and a the second a missile with considerable explosive force. The characters are interesting and while we do get an inevitable romance it doesn't detract from the main story. The cast does a good job bringing their characters to life. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of fareastern action in an historical setting... especially if you want realistic action rather than the highly choreographed superhuman fighting that features in many films.These comments are based on watching the film in Korean with English subtitles.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a entertaining movie from beginning to end and is like the movie 300 but with a more captivating plot. Not being racist but I noticed that a lot of Chinese turn a blind eye and tries to bash on this movie by turning a blind eye. But most historical movies from china is far from being historically accurate and goes in more of the video game directions especially movies about the seven kingdoms. Especially the fight sequences with men and sometimes women doing crazy stunts to dodge arrows and jumping almost 10 feet in the air to strike a enemy. Truth is china did try to suppress Korea and Koreans created weapons advanced at the time to fight back. Now some scenes in the movie probably didn't happen the way it did but what historical movie is 100 accurate? I found how Chinese bash on this film in a unfair manner while turning a blind eye on there super historically inaccurate movies and glorify it while trying to bash on a film that is more accurate than most historical Chinese films. Sure I can understand how it tries to make it more entertaining for the viewers but far from being accurate in most cases. The action is fun to watch and the pacing of this film is well done and you actually care for the characters that is trying to fight for independence. If you want to see one guy fighting 100 at once or people flying in the the air like some movies you might be disappointed. I enjoyed this film though and I highly recommend other Asian movie lovers to check it out as well. I like Chinese movies but is annoyed by some ignorant critics. Kinda like how some Persians threw a hissy fit about the movie 300 except this film is not based on a comic book. 7.710".

	schema:reviewBody "Luc Besson's movie Lon The Professional gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler.  Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package.  Jean Reno plays a character named  Lon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a cleaner or hitman.  His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help he learns about living a normal life even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.The performance delivered by then twelveyear old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant.  Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role.  Mathilda and Lon are unexpectedly thrown together but learn to value life from their chance encounter and how valuable a friendship can be.Jean Reno as Lon gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about.  Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had while Lon serves as a father and friend to her.  Gary Oldman as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope.  He moves the story along by his actions.  Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.The Professional is what moviemaking is all about.  Without the overuse of special effects a large shooting location or a commercially star studded cast we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie.  Portman Oldman and Reno along with Danny Aiello as the hitcontractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy drama and action and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates.  The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put an intense and impressive movie.".

He lives quietly from kill to kill harming noone whom he has not been paid to assassinate. He is a simplistic childlike man who lives by his own set of morals but is troubled by them. The one thing he seems to fear above all else is change.Mathilda Natalie Portman is Leon's neighbour. A young girl she lives with her father stepmother halfsister and halfbrother. As unhappy as Leon she lives in awe of the dark stranger unaware of his true profession. Beaten by her parents and sister she has abandoned school and instead spends the day watching cartoons and trying to escape from the real world.When Mathilda's family is brutally murdered by a drug crazed Norman Stansfield Gary Oldman her only chance for survival is to hide with her neighbour. When she learns of Leon's true identity she becomes infatuated with both him and the grim world he inhabits.This stark portrayal of humanity and inhumanity is produced with the style and finesse that one expects from Luc Besson. In addition the combined talents of Jean Reno Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman provide not only an unmatched onscreen chemistry but also three perfectly created characterisations the like of which are rarely seen in today's cinema. This film has my personal recommendation of being the best piece of cinema that I know of. I have not seen anything that matches it in terms of intensity or emotion  and believe me I've looked. I found myself caring for the characters involved an unique experience in itself.  This is not the type of film for a night in with your mates but nevertheless it is an unforgettable piece of cinematic history.".

Occasionally I make an exception  some films simply cannot be fully appreciated on just one viewing. Every time I watch Leon is as gripping and enjoyable as the first. Sad funny violent incredibly touching  few films manage to tick all the boxes and even fewer are about hitmen.It obviously helps when your leading man has as much screen presence as Jean Reno. Thin and wiry with toilet brush hair and a face like a bag of spanners he is hardly your typical guntoting action hero but he has an innocence and compassion that makes you fall for him instantly. Leon's life is as simple as a small child's TV lashings of milk and the odd gangland assassination. He cannot read he doesn't sleep he hasn't the trappings of family or wealth the fees for his hits are habitually trousered by his benefactor' sleazy smalltime Italian gangster Tony Danny Aiello  In short he lives like a robot. And then he meets Mathilda.Normally I can't stand Hollywood kids. They are all doeyeyed bouffanthaired brats who can cry on cue and are always ready with a cutesy smartalec comment that will cause their adult costars to tinkle with laughter or tousle their hair playfully. Often they are kidnapped and huge ransoms demanded while their parents go demented with worry. I for one am usually rooting for the kidnappers.Natalie Portman's Mathilda is the antithesis of these nambypamby Dawson's Creek actorsinwaiting. For starters she has something justifiable to gripe about in that her entire family has just been slaughtered by Gary Oldman and his gang of crooked DEA officers. This is a bit of a blow to say the least but Mathilda takes it all in her stride and teams up with Leon in a bid for revenge. So begins one of the stranger relationships in silver screen history but one of the most memorable.On the face of it a love story between a twelve year old girl and a hairy French hitman would raise a few eyebrows among more conservative moviegoers but director Luc Besson handles it so beautifully it seems like the most natural thing on earth. They are united in being totally alone in the world  indeed the scene where Mathilda walks quietly down the corridor past the carnage in her apartment and knocks on Leon's door imploring him in a tearful whisper to let her in is as breathtaking as it is heartbreaking. Leon is wary at first but she soon wins him round and starts to gently bring him out of the shell.Portman is truly astonishing  one can almost forgive her for being a part of the appalling Star Wars prequels on the strength of this one performance. The iconic image of this tiny grubby little girl clutching Leon's beloved plant and trotting to keep up with her lanky hero's giant strides is one that will live long in the memory.Aiello and Oldman at his sadistic malevolent best provide predictably excellent support there is a wonderfully suspenseful yet satisfying ending  heck there's even a decent Sting song playing over the credits  for this if nothing else it would be remiss of me to give Leon anything other than top marks.1010".

The iconic image of this tiny grubby little girl clutching Leon's beloved plant and trotting to keep up with her lanky hero's giant strides is one that will live long in the memory.Aiello and Oldman at his sadistic malevolent best provide predictably excellent support there is a wonderfully suspenseful yet satisfying ending  heck there's even a decent Sting song playing over the credits  for this if nothing else it would be remiss of me to give Leon anything other than top marks.1010";

	schema:reviewBody "Leon is one of the most emotionally intense movies ever made. French director Luc Besson uses everything actors music camera angles lighting to create an unique experience  It's not realism it's not naturalism  it's heightened reality as Gary Oldman very well put it.In The making of The Professional Besson says If I imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter I kill the guy in five seconds. I kill him and I think It's in me I'm a beast! On this part we can't forget that a part of us the genetic things inside are much much older than The Ten Commandments. He certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion  in the movie  the blood running from Mathilda's nose or Stansfield's unforgettable EVERYONE! are just a couple of examples. The music and the sound are excellent and are used in a masterly fashion  you can hear Fatman's heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when Stansfield turns to look at Mathilda's father.However Leon does not work only on this primary level it also has an intelligent story. It may seem to be almost a fairytale but don't be fooled   just like his character Besson is serious. This movie has a message without love we are dead even if we don't see it. Only true love give meaning to our lives everything else reminds me a big yogurt warm and rancid as Mathilda says in the original script which is available on the net under the name Leon Version 1. Is this true in real life? I don't know but this movie can make you wonder.Then of course there's the sensuality. It's hypocritical to deny it the camera interacts with Mathilda in a mesmerising fashion. It's not sick and it's not degrading it's art subtle and beautiful.Leon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven. It's a movie that really should not be missed unless you are concerned with its amorality. And don't be  Leon is less violent than many action movies and the unusual relationship between the main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling and tact.".

	schema:reviewBody "With enough blood and gore to please any fan of action movies and a unique love story to please the ladies this is a great movie for couples to watch together. However to truly comprehend the beauty of this film you must see the European Cut.The U.S. version is still a great movie but it cuts out 24 minutes which contain much of the heart of the movie and most of what makes the film a work of art instead of the usual action fodder. Elements of the story which are only hinted at in the U.S. cut become the centerpiece of the story when the uncut version is seen.The two main characters are a recentlyorphaned girl who is wise beyond her years and a hitman who is still an innocent. Their relationship unfolds against a backdrop of murder and revenge as director Luc Besson explores issues of age and maturity good and evil and the interplay of life death and love.The acting in this film is superb. Reno has an expressive face which conveys a myriad of emotions with great sensitivity and few words. He is cold as ice as the almost superhuman 'professional' but his performance is most moving when he reveals his sensitive side. Watching as his wounded soul slowly begins to heal is enough to touch the heart of any woman but it is handled so subtly that it never becomes too 'sappy'.In her film debut Natalie Portman turns in a performance that is beautiful beyond belief. She manages the transition from a  frightened child to a woman capable of killing so convincingly that it makes the relationship between she and Leon not only believable but understandable.Gary Oldman is just the best psycho there is and it is kind of nice to see him without all the strange makeup for a change. As a dirty cop in this film he personifies evil and it is a joy to watch him do his thing.The special effects are all you could hope for. Besson does great actions scenes  especially the explosions. There is also a lot of humor and when you throw in the tender love story   this picture has it all!".

	schema:reviewBody "An interview with Anne Parillaud in the Evening Standard 24.8.90 it was said that the message of Nikita is not one of violence but the idea is that people who are full of despair and missing love are not alone.This idea continues in Lon. Lon was Besson's first foray into international film production. The similarities or parallels between Nikita and Lon are undoubted. Both the central protagonists attempt to come to terms with their dysfunctionality to society against a background of violence which they both continue to act upon as the agent of someone else. There is no clean difference we may also include Le Dernier Combat for comparison. The only difference is gender.I always found that until obtaining the Version Integral there was a character hole in the plot. The original cut released for US audiences was felt by Besson had an offending scene cut which ruined later scenes. The American test audiences hated it seeing it as perverse and paedophiliac. The film was still panned by US critics as quasichild pornography on general release. What it to be understood about this film and this is what infuriated Besson is that the film is about pure love. Not sex which is all the Americans could see.And so we have ascertained that the characters in Besson's films are simply great. Then there is the action which is all the grace and style of Nikita. Typical of Besson's style with fast actionshooting and violent characterisation. This has to be one of Jean Reno's and by far Natalie Portman's best screen performance. To me Gary Oldman plays his part to the tee said by some magazines to be the best screen bad guy  it is one of his best performances.Stylisation and excess are hallmarks of Besson's work. Characters are larger than life. Dcors are in excess of realism. Besson's characters lack psychological depth. The sumptuous and the ornate cohabit with the violent or the vulgar. Besson's use of excess is also extremely playful mixing violence with humour. Besson's work appeals to the tastes of popular culture and may not please that of the elite  arguably a reason for the rejection of his work by many intellectual film journals.I have yet to hear of a person putting a bad word against this film. There is nothing I can personally fault so I give this film 1010 a score only two other somewhat different films hold in my IMDb list of 345 films  The Wizard of Oz and La Cit des Enfants perdu. If you like French Cinema or consider yourself a cinephile you must see the latter.".

His godfather and mentor is the mobster Tony Danny Aiello who loves Len as if he were his own son and his cold blood makes him a perfect killer. When Stansfield Gary Oldman and his gang executes the family of his twelve years old neighbor Mathilda Natalie Portman Len lodges the girl in his place beginning a weird friendship between a killer and a confused girl wishing revenge. When Mathilda finds who Stansfield is she presses Len to kill him. 'Len' is a wonderful movie having one of the most perfect chemistry in the cinema between Jean Reno and Natalie Portman. The storyline recalls some parts of John Cassavetes' 'Gloria' but the performances of the debutant Natalie Portman and the alwaysexcellent Jean Reno upgrade this film. There are at least three scenes that I really love the light on the corridor when Len opens the door for Mathilda when they are walking together in a New York street coming towards the camera and when Stansfield hits Len. My vote is ten.Title Brazil 'O Profissional' 'The Professional'".

Intelligently shot and scripted. It makes everything that follows hard to live upto. But it does so easily. It's stylish without being showy it's deep without being sentimental. And it's just hugely enjoyable. Seeing the friendship between newly orphaned mathilda and skilled assasin leon bloom is tenderly done. At risk of slipping into a sappy bond besson keeps it easy on the emotions without coming off as shallow.The actors are all spot on most notably the debut from a young natalie portman as mathilda. Showing an angry sad pent up in love girl is no simple task but she breezes through it touching all the right notes. And jean reno as the title character is minimal but very effecting. Hard to understand but easy to relate too. But gary oldman steals it with his glorious overacting. He's as scary as he is determind. His line delivery is almost perfect. And his fate is very fitting. If only they made more intelligent action movies then they could contend with this film. But as it stands right now leon is one of the best action dramas ever made.".

The action was thrilling and I always wanted to be like Leon a stone cold bad ass with a heart.About 20 years after I first saw The Professional I watched it again and it was awesome. It was awesome not because of the nostalgic feeling but because it is a movie that has stood the test of time. Its formula is simple but yet captivating. This is not your typical action movie of a buff guy of a pretty action star that was the norm in the early 90's but the protagonist is someone that is unassuming that epitomises the term silent killer. Gary Oldman gives a masterclass performance as the main antagonist and Natalie Portman gives a performance that makes one question is she was truly a teenager or if she was older. The plot is intriguing and the pacing keeps you engaged the stunts are believable and the action sequences will put modern movies to shame. The music is incredible and the characters have depth and humanized.Without giving out any spoilers this is a film that works in every perceivable way. An A for me".

	schema:headline " An Unclassifiable Classic";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a movie difficult to classify in any genre  which is a big part of what makes it a seemingly timeless classic.Other reviews have described in detail the essentials of the plot and the chemistry between the actors so I will not go over such things in any detail. Rather I will concentrate on my impressions while watching this movie for the first time  which I did just the other week.For years I had been vaguely aware of this film but I never bothered to check it out. The reason was that I assumed that it was basically a mob movie about a hitman  a genre I'm not particularly interested in. Which in once sense it is. However it is much more than that as I discovered when I finally got around to seeing it.When I started watching this movie at first I found my impressions confirmed as it opens with an apparently unstoppable mob assassin 'hitting' a group of drug dealing mooks. This opening scene was interesting in that the viewer never sees the killer directly  only in hints. This adds to the sense he's like a shadow or a ghost an unstoppable force.However the viewer soon discovers he's very much a human  and a sad lonely one at that living a marginal life in a slum with only his plant for company. At the same time the viewer is introduced to Mathilda the young neighbor girl who lives next door  who also lives a sad lonely and miserable life.Soon the unstoppable assassin saves the young girl from the hit squad of drugdealing cops and that's when the movie changes ... from a more typical mob shooter into something very like a very dark romantic comedydrama. This I was not expecting. I was sort of expecting that the hit man would protect the girl who would be more of a nonentity  a MacGuffin if you will a joke they employ in the movie itself  at one point she registers them in a hotel under the name MacGuffin.As a viewer I watched the unfolding sexual tension between the girl and the killer with uneasiness and dismay. Which appears to have been exactly the point the filmmaker was making. The viewer is kept uneasy not knowing exactly where this relationship is going  just how transgressive it is going to be ... is Mathilda actually in love with Leon? Is this love returned? Or is Mathilda just manipulating Leon to convince him to help her carry out her revenge? The answer appears to be a bit of yes to all the above  though Leon displays no sexual interest in Mathilda he clearly grows to love her in the sense of wanting what is best for her even above his own selfinterest.Mathilda on her part is certainly not above lying and manipulation in order to get what she wants. While she expresses her love for him repeatedly to the point of outright propositioning him for sex it is pretty clear that this sexual aggressiveness is the result of her abusive upbringing and her desire for adulthood  to her it would seem love means sexual love only as she has never seen any other kind other than cuddling with her baby brother. She both needs Leon to carry out her revenge and loves Leon the only adult who has ever been kind to her. In that context her declarations are both an attempt to bind Leon to her a sort of manipulation and the only expression of an adult type love she can understand.The point is that this is a surprisingly deep and sensitive exploration of a relationship and nothing like what one would expect from a typical action movie. For me at least this raises the movie to the level of a classic.".

It's just brilliant in every aspect  from casting to call and from beginning to end without a little distraction in between. Luc Besson has done a good job and Gary Oldman! My god! Why didn't he win an Oscar for this role? Jean Reno did a terrific acting and so did the young Natalie.What starts off as an introduction to the 'cleaner' takes a whole new direction as the girl meets our Hitman. Then comes Norman the badass cop for a drug related issue with the girl's father. A murderous scene that sets in so naturally that I felt I was in that room. The girl is fortunately safe and credit goes to her mother who sent her to the grocery and Leon who allows her inside after she seeks help witnessing the aftermath.Later on I thought the story between Leon and Mathalda would go somewhat like TerminatorJudgement Day. But there was something even more special. Leon is losing his murderous instinct bit by bit as he grows into a 'Caretaker' and Mathalda loses her craze for killing and adulthood again a bit by bit. The way the climax has been written and presented boy! 200 cops on one man and still they struggle to take him out until he finally sacrifices his life to save the pretty girl. Every thing in the middle that I've left out is something that I can only feel from the experience of watching this movie. Natalie Portman is now a huge star and she deserves her stardom and acclaim after having acted like this in her very first film and remember its no small film.It's a type of movie that I get to watch on rare occasions.

	schema:reviewBody "I sensed that Luc Besson director of The Fifth Element and La Femme Nikita was like Tarantino and many many others before him borrowed elements from various films and genres to create their own voice in the film. With Leon I sensed him alluding to the crime films of France i.e. Melville HongKong i.e. Woo and America i.e. Scorsese and making it into his own special brand for the story and characters. That his style visually is as compelling helps a great deal. The international version which is the one I saw is a little grittier and more suggestive than the version most American audiences saw in 1994 and on cable. But it is also a mustsee if you are planning to see the film. It's not a long movie though it gives a good many details in its story.Jean Reno has his starmaking turn at least for what he's worth in Leon he's ruthless contract killer who will kill just about anyone for the right price. He lives out of an apartment by himself trying his best to ignore his noisy neighbors. One of the daughters is Mathilda Natalie Portman also a major breakthrough performance abused by her whole family to no end. When a corrupt cop Gary Oldman one of the key villain performances of his career along with Dracula and Drexl in True Romance goes and kills off her family while she's away she has no one else to turn to besides the reclusive killer. She knows what he does and she wants in. The rest of the film is about their relationship as it unfolds professionally and emotionally leading to a tremendous bloody climax.One thing that struck me most about Leon is the fact that the film was more disturbing than I expected. The idea of a killer getting a pupil in a young teenage girl is unusual enough but the way it unfolds I felt so much for her plight got to me at times. this doesn't make Leon a tearjerker maybe for some I'm not sure but because of Portman's deadon portrayal it makes the story work somehow and is in a way as fantastical as it is naturalistic. There are also a few scenes that stuck out as being little masterpieces of all the elements coming together. The first is a brief scene and crucial to showing the character of Leon early on he takes a break after his contract and sees a movie a musical with Gene Kelly. He's the only one in the theater and he is completely in the grasp of what he sees on the screen. It's the perfect touch of humanity and shows his only escape is into complete fantasy.The second is when Leon and Mathilda are in a restaurant after she has just gone through a day of training there's a hilarious montage that follows this scene. Mathilda is getting drunk off of champagne rambling with words she may or may not mean. Suddenly she starts laughing and she laughs more and harder. People in the restaurant look at her like she's nuts. Leon is of course embarrassed. However I thought this was just the right touch to this scene where the kind of fatherdaughter relationship going on between Leon and Mathilda is revealed. It's not exactly funny not even really cringe worthy. It just is. The third scene is when Mathilda decides to pay a visit to the man who murdered her family. She follows the man into the bathroom and waits. Suddenly he Oldman appears out from behind a door. The language used the tenseness of the two off of one another it's simply the most terrifying scene in the picture aside from the first violent turning point.So basically when Leon finished I think I realized that my reaction was this if I had seen this film when I was younger be it in high school or even middle school I would've responded to it even more strongly than I do now. There's something very visceral about the nature of violence and killing as well as the mentorpupil relationship that Besson really gets down pat. While some of the situations have the chance of slipping into clichs it doesn't happen very often. Leon The Professional is hardhitting when it has to be soft and funny when it can and does stay with the viewer a few days after it's over.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many movies have characters in them who are hired assassins or hit men. They're the standard badass character that kills people in order to collect a reward. Most hit men in films have been portrayed as cold heartless villains Boba Fett of Star Wars Vincent of Collateral. Lon however flips this clich on its end as the hitman is the kindhearted protagonist who learns how to love thanks to a little girl who shows up on his doorstep.Lon begins in a restaurant with the assassin himself Jean Reno taking a contract from his boss Tony Danny Aiello to kill a man who's moving in on Tony's territory. The next 10 minutes become an enthralling cat and mouse game where Leon shows the viewers just why he is known as the cleaner he is extremely good at this job. We also see Leon's human side shown by his passion for milk his affection for his plant whom he calls his best friend and when he becomes engrossed watching Singin' in the Rain. Leon seems quite content with this life not seeming to want anything more. That is until he is forced to take custody of a twelveyearold girl Natalie Portman whose entire family was cruelly massacred by a corrupt DEA agent Gary Oldman. This is where Leon is forced to change his lifestyle for the little girl and when she wishes to get into contract killing to avenge her brother Leon becomes her mentor and protector.Luc Besson was both the director and screenwriter for Lon and he proves with his sophomore effort that he is no onehit wonder. Lon is a very fast paced movie chronicling Leon's training of Mathilda Mathilda's growing affection for contract killing and for Leon himself and the final standoff with Norman Stansfield. Despite all this Lon also has time to throw in some slower scenes that develop Leon's and Mathilda's characters expanding on their growing relationship and partnership.Jean Reno does a very good job as Leon portraying him both as an effective and frightening killing machine and as a loving and caring father figure. There is almost a childlike innocence to Leon with him being unable to read and not familiar with most American culture. Reno allows the audience to both sympathize with this character and respect him an extremely challenging feat.Natalie Portman's breakout role as Mathilda is one of the greatest acted child roles in a film period. Portman is able to portray childlike innocence combined with an above average intelligence and awareness of the world around her. Although she is young she becomes extremely interested in Leon and his job wanting revenge for the gross acts committed upon her. Make no mistake Mathilda is the true star of this film and Portman completely shines in the role.In comparison to Jean Reno's fairly subdued performance as Leon apparently Luc Besson wanted a more exciting and overthetop antagonist for the film enter Gary Oldman. Gary Oldman completely overacts his character of the crooked DEA cop and he does it so wonderfully that he steals every scene he is in. This is without a doubt the greatest performance of this underrated actor's career as the fun Oldman has with this role practically oozes out of the screen and infects anyone who watches him. While some critics criticized Oldman for his performance it was actually spot on considering that the character of Stansfield is a drugaddicted psychotic cop who has no problem with murdering an innocent family to get what he desires. The only nitpick I have with Stansfield is his screen time is fairly small compared with Leon and Mathilda nevertheless he completely steals the show when he does appear.The plot of Lon is fairly straightforward compared to most action flicks as there are no particular plot twists or double crossings. However the simple plot works because this is not a plot driven movie it is a character driven one. That's not to say there is no action in this movie there are a few great action sequences especially the spectacular police shootout in the film's climax but the film mainly revolves around the growing affection between Leon and Mathilda and how they change each others' lives. Overall Lon is an extremely wellmade actiondrama and one of the best films of 1994.".

	onyx:emotionText "Many movies have characters in them who are hired assassins or hit men. They're the standard badass character that kills people in order to collect a reward. Most hit men in films have been portrayed as cold heartless villains Boba Fett of Star Wars Vincent of Collateral. Lon however flips this clich on its end as the hitman is the kindhearted protagonist who learns how to love thanks to a little girl who shows up on his doorstep.Lon begins in a restaurant with the assassin himself Jean Reno taking a contract from his boss Tony Danny Aiello to kill a man who's moving in on Tony's territory. The next 10 minutes become an enthralling cat and mouse game where Leon shows the viewers just why he is known as the cleaner he is extremely good at this job. We also see Leon's human side shown by his passion for milk his affection for his plant whom he calls his best friend and when he becomes engrossed watching Singin' in the Rain.

I'd originally had no real intention of seeing it because I'd read a pretty savage review of it likening it to child pornography. Clearly this particular reviewer had his head firmly planted in his rear. I'm surprised he could find room what with that tremendous stick in the way. Anyway once I finally saw Leon for myself  thanks to my cinemaphile grandfather  I observed no such thing. This wasn't smut it was love. Leon has no interest in Matilda sexually but loves her as a father would love a daughter.If you have a choice then go for the longer director's cut. You get about 15 minutes more film  and not just filler. These are scenes that truly expand upon the story.My only complaints are about the almost complete under use of the completely underrated Danny Aiello and Oldman's single dimensional evilness.".

But speaking of 90s crime dramas and mob films Goodfellas Pulp Fiction The Usual Suspects Se7en Reservoir Dogs etc are much better than this movie at least for me. But still a lot better majority of crime movies today. The main theme  the relationship between Leon and Mathilda  mostly satisfying and very well written and directed. That is something I really loved. But at the same time a part of that relationship is quite a mixed bag for me. SPOILERS Mathilda falls in love with Leon and asks him for intimacy. As much as I admire Besson's decision it feels unusually weird. Plus Natalie Portman was just around 12 or 13 years old and there were some perverted shots of her in the movie that I didn't really want to see. The LeonMathilda plotline except for this part was quite good. And which means almost more than a half of the movie was good. Mathilda becoming a hitman plotline  the motivation felt a little forced to me her training sessions were finely entertaining but ..... where and how did it really end? More than becoming a real hitman probably she did in the montage sequence we only get to see her do some crazy teenager stuffs. And one of my biggest issues  Mathilda wanting a revenge on Stan plotline. It would have been a better movie if this one and the first plotline I mentioned were equally a major part of the movie. But the movie deviates from this a lot. We get reminded about this part when Gary Oldman shows up. This was one of the main parts of the plot but didn't really feel like one. Also Stan is a simple crazy psychoish villain with nothing much of depth to him. The first plotline worked for me in the way it did mostly because of the amazing performances of Jean Reno and Natalie Portman. They were very great. Leon was written very carefully. And ........ Gary Oldman ......... I love the man as an actor he is amazing in most of the his movies I have watched. May be his performances in Darkest Hour and as Commissioner Gordon in Dark Knight Trilogy are my favorite Gary Oldman performances. I haven't seen all of his movies but this is by far the worst Gary Oldman performance I have ever seen. A part of it is to be blamed on Besson but nothing can be taken away from Oldman. He simply hams up the performance. On the whole it's a very enjoyable movie and has it's goods and has it's flaws. Not bad at all. It's good. But it feels like hypocrisy to have this movie as the 30th highest rated movie on IMDb.Score  6.710Grade  BLabel  Decently entertaining for one or occasional views".

	schema:headline " Favorite Movie of alltime here is why";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie in the theatre in 1994 and I really like it then but at the time I wouldnt be able to tell you why. The next time I saw the movie was at home on TIVO in December 2001 and I fell in love with the film all over again.Firstly the theme of the movie  Isolation and Redemption  The characters Leon and Mathilda had no one who loved them in this world and were very much alone mathilda did have her 4 year old brother but that was all she hadThe characters were dealing with a similar lonlieness even thought heir worlds were very different.Secondly the scripting in the film really hit me. When a bloodied beaten Mathilda turns to Leon after meeting him only once or twice she says to him Is life always this hard or just when your a kid? Leon pauses and his response to her was not what anyone would expect. The whole movie is well scripted and blows me away.Thirdly The cinematography is top notch. When Mathilda arrives at Leons door and she pleads to enter and when the door opens bathing her in light is simply breathtaking. The closeups on the characters and the way the camera is held over their shoulder as they talk with each other really gives it a personal feel to allow you to empathise with the characters. I could go on about the cinematography more but I have more.Fourth the music by Eric Serra. I really enjoyed the music more and more with each viewing as I came to realize that the soundtrack was orchestrated specifically after each scene was filmed and then the music was designed to match what was happening on screen. Sometimes I watch the movie and just pay close attention to the details in the music. It creates a whole new perspective.Fifth the acting and the casting. Jean Reno plays Leon so perfectly. You really can sense what the character is about. The soft spoken hitman who is like a child in many ways but extremely skilled at his job. Natalie Portman plays the street wise Mathilda who has to pull off one hell of a performance. Many say it is her best role and I agree. Much of the acting by both of these characters is done with simple facial expression. The dialogue between these two leaves you wanting to see more. Danny Aiello as Tony. Gotta love Tony. Is he a good guy or a bad guy? Its open to debate and thats the way it is intended. Gary Oldman as Stansfield  The bad cop  what can you say? he plays the role over the top and is perfect and nuts.Sixth Luc Besson director writer and visionary who saw the potential of this film and went for it. How could anyone expect a movie that has a hitman who protects a twelve year old girl who falls in love with him and wants to be trained as an assassin to be a great film? Luc and Co. realized the dre am and brought the right people on board to make this very special film. I am amazed that it even came to be. He rested 50 of the acting chores on a 12 yr. old girl with no acting lessons or experience  his film depended on her and he was a little worried no doubt. But he showed her what he needed from her and she gave everything she had... and it shows.All I can say is this movie is like a song that I never grow tired off. I know there are others who fell the same way. Feel free to email me and join the Leon fan club on yahoo. 10 out of 10 of course.".

For me is this movie the real 1 of the top 250! I watched it let's say more than 1000 times and I'm still hoping that Lon can get through the door and reach the bright sun light. The acting is with one word superb and the genius soundtrack is just killing it. Lon is the best movie character I have ever seen and I'm quite sure that there will be no one who can top himThis is straight 1010 and nothing else.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a piece of Art. Truly unique in its genre. It successfully blends action drama thriller ...you name it together. Its masterfully directed by Luc Besson which proves that you dont need a big budget to make a really good movie. The shooting is awesome Camera angles close to face camera focus scenes such as Mathildas face illuminating as the door opens and the white flash at the end is simply awesome! The Musical score and soundtrack such as Sting and Bjrk is again... Very well chosen and fits the movie completely! The movie contains some unforgettable dialogues  scenes too. The scene where there is a burst of laughter in the Restaurant or the toilet scene with Gary Oldman is just a treat to watch that guy act! From its explosive start to its brilliant ending no any segments gets boring at any time everything is relevant and you just want more!The acting by the magical Trio Jean RenoNathalie PortmanGary Oldman just smokes! Nuff said. Probably one of the best Ive ever seen in a movie. You could read everything just on their facial expressions and looks real. Its really amazingAbout the controversial pedophile issue I think you guys are pushing this a little too far. The Bed scenes etc it is not sex but platonic love as Besson said! Its that love in the air that makes the movie even more gripping.Timeless classic and among just the handful of movies you could watch indefinitely No questions. Im always happy. This is a straight 10. This is my favorite movie.".

	schema:headline " Kiduk dreams of Odagiri";
	schema:reviewBody "Dream or Bimong as is the Korean title is already Kiduk's 15th film. It's also the 15th Kiduk film I watched so obviously you can consider me a fan. Kiduk is a director who's known to stay pretty close to what he does best so even though the differences between Dream and his earlier films might not seem stellar they do present a big deviation for Kiduk standards. Yet in the end Dream is still 100 Kiduk and couldn't have been made by any other.Central to Dream is the casting of Jo Odagiri Japanese acting talent who's often considered to be Tadanobu Asano's professional twin and rightfully so. Odagiri is known for his interesting choices in film and his foreign appeal. Even their looks seem to match from time to time. Odagiri plays a large part in Kiduk's latest and marks Kiduk's first big deviation. It's the first time a foreign film star takes the center stage in one of his films.Probably even bolder is the fact that Odagiri is allowed to speak Japanese throughout the whole of the film. There is no language barrier for the characters which is a pretty rare choice to make. Even though it is never specified whether Odagiri plays a Japanese or Korean character the way Japanese and Korean are mixed is very unnatural. Still after a few minutes of getting used to it only works in favor of the film as Odagiri can focus on acting rather than struggle with a foreign language.Kiduk's second departure from his signature style is the amount of dialog featured in the film. Not exactly the first time he allows his characters to communicate verbally cfr Time  Shi Gan but it still feels very unKiduklike. On the other hand it fits the film well and Kiduk does a much better job of handling the dialog than he did with Time. And even though there might be more dialog to Kiduk standards there are still pretty long stretches were characters do little more than grunt and act especially near the end of the film.Apart from these two deviations all crucial Kiduk elements are still very much in place. There are the strong key performances very troubled and somewhat enigmatic characters a touch of magic and at the end there is hope tragic as the events might have been. And in between all that there is enough confusion and symbolism to keep people who like to puzzle more than satisfied.Visually Kiduk is aiming for a more outspoken visual style here. He's not completely succeeding but the key scenes are all well directed and from time to time there is some stellar imagery to admire. Still there is room for improvement as some scenes still feel a bit bland compared to the others. Much better is the soundtrack which is every bit as mystical as it is special. Though a little overdone in the dream segments the singing near the end of the film really gives the film some extra chills and cuts right through the bone. No idea which language was used for the songs but it fit the film wonderfully.Apart from the strong leads the big plus of Dream is it's exceptional concept. Rather than spoil it here  it is much nicer to find it out for yourself  I'll say that it is every bit as magical as BinJip's finale. Kiduk eases the viewer into the story and goes full out in the last half hour turning the film around again to be all you'd expect from a Kiduk film. Characters are hurting reality is often as flaky as dreams can be and tragedy lies just around the corner.The scene in the field near the river marks a shift to Kiduk's usual trickery and from there on the film is elevated to a higher level. Odagiri is as strong as ever his female companion acts on an equal level and the both of them really bring Kiduk's Dream to life. If you get past the excessive dialog for a Kiduk film at least and accept the quirky but smart mix of Korean and Japanese Dream's another Kiduk film rivaling the best of his previous work.Since BinJip only Shi Gan was a small disappointment. Apart from that one Kiduk seems to be on a roll with a string of nearmasterpieces almost uncontested by any other director. That said I think Kiduk is still missing that final touch to make his films into true fullfledged masterpieces. Some more attention to the visual side and a little more attention to the integration of the soundtrack but it seems he's getting there slowly but surely. Odagiri's presence was a smart move so was the strong and exceptional idea behind the film. One of Kiduk's best no doubt. 4.55.0".

	schema:headline " Despite some excellent performances the film suffers from an artificial construction that drives it into a predetermined direction spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "Kim KiDuk's tale of how a man and a woman become linked by dreams.It begins with Jin waking up from a vivid dream involving a car accident. Going to the scene he finds th police are investigating a hit and run accident. Following information from a traffic camera the police go to Ran's home find that she was asleep. Hauled to the police station Ran tries to protest but there are pictures of her driving the car. Jin tries to intercede and soon its discovered that Ran has taken to sleep walking recently.It seems that when ever Jin dreams Ran acts out his dreams but in an opposite way which means that Jin who is trying to see his exgirlfriend whom he still loves causes Ran to see her ex boyfriend whom she despises.This is a dark romantic tale is an often uncomfortable to watch since we know what the dreams mean. Ran is getting hurt because of what Jin is dreaming and there is little that the pair can do. Well acted we feel for the characters because the actors makes it clear that sometimes its so hard to stay awake. They have created two nice characters that we feel bad for.Unfortunately the film has a couple of problems that work against the valiant attempts of the actors. First the score is not very good. It seems to belong to some cheesy exploitation film from the 1970's. For me it was all wrong and from the first notes it set a really bad mood. The other problem is that script doesn't really work. The characters are never fully fleshed out and as much as the actors try to breath life into them they sill feel a bit hollow or unformed. The trajectory of the story kind of seems too artificial. The film seems not to always be moving in a natural direction I had the feeling that the director wanted it to go in a certain direction and thats the way it goes. This being a Kim KiDuk film it's ripe with a sense of darkness and or even dread. This is not a wholly happy tale even if it is ultimately a love story there is some violent imagery.In the end I don't know what I make of it. I like the idea I like the characters but there is something about the way the film is told that rubbed me the wrong way. I think its an interesting misfire. And lest you think that I don't get Kim KiDuk's style or his films understand that I am a fan having all but his first three films in my collection. if you're a fan of the director or adventurous I think its worth trying for the characters and the pieces that work but at the same time I'd wait for it to be a rental or less likely on cable.Between 5 and 6 with my feelings toward the film bouncing back and forth between the ratings".

Personally I had not taken that advice and dove into the deep end only to find myself stuck in a confluence of mixed feelings where some of the films had excited others had disappointed going nowhere though you must admit that there are always plenty of imagery in his films to admire and a premise like none other.Within the first 20 minutes we get introduced to the main characters and the interesting though weird premise that they find themselves in. Jo Odagiri stars as Jin a man who often finds himself dreaming about some very vivid events then out of curiosity one day he visits an accident site that he dreamt about and lo and behold the exact same situation that he had seen subconsciously.His curiosity led him to dig further and here he comes across Ren Lee Nayeong a woman who sleepwalks. In more bizarre terms Jin soon realizes that whatever he dreams of Ren somehow will sleepwalk and execute it on his behalf in real time. Hence the stage is set for this fantastical movie where a couple find themselves having power over each other and made more acute when they discover that perhaps their respective exlovers have got a part to play in their predicament as well.You'd come to expect that perhaps Jin and Ren would fall for each other and this was even suggested at but of course Kim Kiduk would never go for the plain and ordinary. Instead he skews this potential love story into something more intense and comical even especially when the couple try their very best not to fall asleep one to prevent executing things against her wishes while the other not wanting to impose his will onto another.Alas the ingredients that went into the film turned out to be not my taste. Everything went really weird especially when Kim settled for some gory moments of imagery to continue his story some of which are squirmish enough to want to make you shut your eye from the nightmare. Also having Jo Odagiri speak in Japanese throughout and the only character to do so seemed too strange as well where everyone else was speaking in Korean. I suppose like Kim's earlier film in casting Chang Chen resulted in his character being mute was nothing more than overcoming a technical challenge in making the actors speak the Korean language. Straddling the thin line between reality and fantasy would have afforded a tale told in this manner but certainly this wasn't my cup of tea.The Closing Film of this year's Korean Film Festival those in attendance will attest to bewildered voices whispering sighs of disapproval and sniggering at how ridiculous the film had unravelled itself into. I suppose if not for Jo Odagiri's role many would have not batted an eyelid at yet another Kim Kiduk offering for the masses. Was I disappointed? Yes as the film could have been much more rather than a selfindulgent movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Frozen Flower got billed here as The Year's Sexiest Blockbuster and writerdirector Ha Yu's movie could probably be also billed as an equivalent to Zhang Yimou's Curse of the Golden Flower given its period setting and schemes within a royal household plenty of gorgeous costumes opulent production sets with a tinge of wirefu martial arts and a chock load of mixed romances thrown in for good measure too.Set in the Korean Koryo era where it's under the control of the Mongol's Yuan Dynasty the current gay Koryo King Joo Jin Mo sets up his own elite bodyguard troops recruiting 36 young boys to undergo extreme training and eliciting pledges of unfettered loyalty from this group of trusted men. Amongst all he favours Hong Lim Jo In Sung and spent plenty of personal and quality time with his pet from the open plains hunting to the courtyards training right down to the games both play in the royal bedroom. Nepotism runs in the royal household since it's an open secret as to why the King appoints Lim as chief of his bodyguards undoubtedly also because of the advantage of up close and personal already from within the royal chambers.The malecentric world soon got shaken by the introduction of the Yuan princess to be Queen Song Ji Hyo in an alliance forged by marriage and I guess you can see how this third party could cause severe problems. Pressure mounts when the royal family is expected to bear an heir otherwise a successor to the throne will be appointed. This displeases the King of course given someone on the outside waiting in the wings for his demise but then his sexual preference also meant that he can't get it up. So in desperation he crafts a crazy plan in over to hang onto power and that's to order his lover Hong to impregnate the Queen and produce an heir whom he will accept as his own thereby protecting his throne. The Queen reluctantly agrees of course but as a woman who accepted to be loyal to the kingdom she's got to do what is best for her husband. As for Hong well it's duty toward both King and Country.What this does is in fact to push both the Queen and Hong into an uncontrollable sexual awakening which the rest of the film pretty much centres upon dealing in relationships and the vast emotions that come along with it including the negative ones like jealously and ultimately rage and hatred. While at first Hong couldn't get himself to betray his first love I guess it probably is easier for any guy to treat sex as sex without an emotional baggage though it did tickle Hong's heart that perhaps the female of the species was more interesting and his breakaway from a malecentric relationship was seen as a betrayal and treason to the King.As for the Queen the power of fleshly pleasures from this perverse consummation of a marriage sees to it that she gains some strength in taking over some control in her restricted life and plots to seduce Hong even more so that she could satisfy her lust which for both parties transform into a healthy heterosexual relationship in which the King obviously despises. I suspect there will be some quarters cheering the film in depicting that homosexuality can be cured by a good dose of sex to open their minds but I thought it was more of a matter of choice and opportunity being presented here since the sexual preference get contrasted between Hong and the King's is quite clear  one's obviously following the heart the other his orders which slowly developed into silent insubordination before the heart fully takes over. In any case this romantic triangle will push and probe when you're viewing this as there are plenty of insights to gain from if you were to put yourself into the shoes of either party and determine how you would react to the sequence of lustful events.The film of course goes beyond love and lust issues although Hong and the Queen go at each other like jackrabbits. There's also a subplot involving the usual political intrigue having the film set in a period setting and not dwelling on this seems wasted with political assassinations bringing about some major set action sequences. I felt it would have probably benefited audiences with no clue about the Yuan dynasty control over Korea at the time if this was given a little more focus but I suppose it's left to further reading on our own. Or had a bit more about the bodyguard unit because they were being utilized for a lot more activities like counterespionage rather than just plain protection purposes.This being Singapore you'll get to see the more explicit heterosexual scenes between the bisexual and the straight woman quite intact though the only at least the only one that made it homosexual one was butchered for the most parts. Those who prefer their films intact could go opt for the DVD instead as the Koreans have already released this which includes a limited unrated 2disc edition.".

Pressure mounts when the royal family is expected to bear an heir otherwise a successor to the throne will be appointed. This displeases the King of course given someone on the outside waiting in the wings for his demise but then his sexual preference also meant that he can't get it up. So in desperation he crafts a crazy plan in over to hang onto power and that's to order his lover Hong to impregnate the Queen and produce an heir whom he will accept as his own thereby protecting his throne. The Queen reluctantly agrees of course but as a woman who accepted to be loyal to the kingdom she's got to do what is best for her husband. As for Hong well it's duty toward both King and Country.What this does is in fact to push both the Queen and Hong into an uncontrollable sexual awakening which the rest of the film pretty much centres upon dealing in relationships and the vast emotions that come along with it including the negative ones like jealously and ultimately rage and hatred. While at first Hong couldn't get himself to betray his first love I guess it probably is easier for any guy to treat sex as sex without an emotional baggage though it did tickle Hong's heart that perhaps the female of the species was more interesting and his breakaway from a malecentric relationship was seen as a betrayal and treason to the King.As for the Queen the power of fleshly pleasures from this perverse consummation of a marriage sees to it that she gains some strength in taking over some control in her restricted life and plots to seduce Hong even more so that she could satisfy her lust which for both parties transform into a healthy heterosexual relationship in which the King obviously despises. I suspect there will be some quarters cheering the film in depicting that homosexuality can be cured by a good dose of sex to open their minds but I thought it was more of a matter of choice and opportunity being presented here since the sexual preference get contrasted between Hong and the King's is quite clear  one's obviously following the heart the other his orders which slowly developed into silent insubordination before the heart fully takes over. In any case this romantic triangle will push and probe when you're viewing this as there are plenty of insights to gain from if you were to put yourself into the shoes of either party and determine how you would react to the sequence of lustful events.The film of course goes beyond love and lust issues although Hong and the Queen go at each other like jackrabbits. There's also a subplot involving the usual political intrigue having the film set in a period setting and not dwelling on this seems wasted with political assassinations bringing about some major set action sequences. I felt it would have probably benefited audiences with no clue about the Yuan dynasty control over Korea at the time if this was given a little more focus but I suppose it's left to further reading on our own. Or had a bit more about the bodyguard unit because they were being utilized for a lot more activities like counterespionage rather than just plain protection purposes.This being Singapore you'll get to see the more explicit heterosexual scenes between the bisexual and the straight woman quite intact though the only at least the only one that made it homosexual one was butchered for the most parts. Those who prefer their films intact could go opt for the DVD instead as the Koreans have already released this which includes a limited unrated 2disc edition.";

Hong Lim devoted his life to the King while the King sees him as a close friend he can trust including the physical intimacy they shared with each other.Under the pressure from the Yuan Kingdom of China for unable to have a son as a heir the King comes with a solution to allow the Queen Song JiHyo conceived by Hong Lim. After sharing the intimacy with Hong Lim the Queen began to meet Hong Lim in private so as to fulfill her desire. It ends up in a tragedy which no one would have foreseen in the first place.Directed by Ha Yu Marriage is a Crazy Thing Frozen Flower dealt with the modern day issues in a ancient Koryo Dynasty background. Homosexuality and adultery are the two topics which is a hushhush in South Korea today has been fully exploited and utilized in the palace. Issues such as conspiracy on overthrowing the King and control of power which were commonly seen in a Korean drama did not get a chance to see the daylight. It ends up as a supporting agenda to tell the story.The movie revolves around the King the Queen and Hong Lim on exploring their desires for each other betrayal and lust. Apart from that there is nothing much left to see on the remaining characters since they are dispensable and their existence in the story do not give much support to the presentation of the story.The affection between the King and Hong Lim were displayed through their daily conversations and actions to each other such as feeding each other when sick exchange of sword fighting skills and pillow talks. On the other hand you will get more than what you see for the relationship between Hong Lim and the Queen where both were seen having sex most of the time.Frozen Flower can be easily related to any modern day love triangle relationship drama or some modern day Korean drama sharing the similar plot. However the movie is greatly similar to Intimate Confessions of a Chinese Courtesan 1972 from HK's Shaw Brothers Studios. The 1972 production discussed similar issues in the view of 2 women and a inspector.If sword fighting and love triangle relationship is your cup of teaFrozen Flower will be a good choice.".

All to be said and done this movie gave me such reflections which I felt the story couldn't be better. The struggling between conscious and desires is forceful enough to overwhelm audience's mind. The scenes and customs were also splendid in details. One thing I would like to point out is I watched both English and Chinese subtitles of this movie. Not to mention that Chinese version is way better. I think the language barrier can affect how you see the movie. The culture difference between east and west also have impacts.It is loosely based on history. The plot was unexpected and mind blowing. Some reviews criticized the young actor who played the guard was not veteran enough. I would differ over that because the director tried to show the young man's first love which would be longing obsessed and addicted. The affection between the guard and queen was growing from lust to love. If you can imagine the society at that time which the two lovers only could express their affections privately you will understand why the director used extensive sexual contents in this movie.

The whole combination made this movie a big hit.1In acting two main actors and the actress did a great job. The characters are really complicated while facing opposite emotions such as loyalty and betrayal love and hate duty and passion obey and disobey at the same time. It is not easy to show cruelty and affection at the same time as two main actors did great in this movie. The actress also was great in showing her two different kinds of relationship with them. They all did a great job to reveal these emotions in their mimics and actions. Their internal combat reflects in their acting amazingly.2 In scenes the movie includes both sexual scenes and historical scenes. While a lot of discussions has been made about the sexual ones I believe they serve the purpose of the movie perfectly. They are not similar to some sexual scenes in other movies when you feel like they are not necessary and are just there to make it an R rate movie. No. Here these scenes reflects the growing emotions and changing winds in the characters' souls. The historical scenes are vivid as well. full of colors actions and harmonyeach and every second of them serves the storyline and events. They help to actually take our minds to that historical era in Korean history. They show us how they pray socialize and celebrate life events in that time which is crucial to make us understand the characters their duties feelings and social aspects.3 Directing and editing metaphored as the second directing are done perfectly. The camera angles are chosen wisely both in big shots in events and close ups while dealing with characters' mimics and inner feelings. Colors and designs works in harmony to elaborate the settings of that era. Imagine I saw the movie without any background in Korea's history and it encourages me to search a bit to know more. Great movie to watch to enjoy and also to explore a different time era if you are interested.".

The shock effect of Blood  Flowers or The Frozen Flower has nothing to do with the sex violence or death scenes in this movie. I found the story harsh because of its total lack of romance. I can handle Asian love stories that are heading towards an inevitable unhappy ending but a complete absence of love or love that is misunderstood makes me sad.This movie made me think of that old French classic Les Liaisons Dangereuses 1782 of Choderlos de Laclos. It shows how people who are playing with other people's loyalty and love will destroy everybody involved including themselves.I won't reveal too much about the story lines and I don't want to discuss the homo sexuality in this movie either. It has been done already and better. This movie left me with a lot of questions about love. Can lust turn into love? What is love anyway is it just a pleasant misunderstanding between lovers if it isn't tried too much? Can you gain something in life if you use your heart in stead of your brain? I won't take 'no' for an answer but this movie does. At least I got the impression the second man in the king's guard who wanted to claim the position of his chief survived everyone in the end because he was such a cold calculating bastard.My verdict Blood  Flowers left me in the dark and in a dark mood. I still give it a 7 out of 10 because the acting was really good. Also the characters are fleshed out no one is really good or evil. I recommend this movie to everyone who wants to discuss the meaning of love with some friends afterwards.".

Selected as an official feature film in the Canne Festival for the second time in a twoyear row this 66 years old director is getting better and better at what he is making of with a Korean culture.Simply Chihwaseon is about a great Korean painter 'Ohwon JANG SeungUp' who was considered as a prodigy in the late Nineteenth century.  The basic story of this film tells the life of Jang Seungup and the historical background of his time.  He was an orphan but in his teens he was picked up by a noble man called Kim ByungMoon.  This Mr.Kim becomes a mentor of Jang as well as lifelong friendship and continues to support his great talent that he knew in the first place.  With Jang's great effort and natural talent his fame grows faster and faster as the strength of his country Korea falls down.Jang's personality portrayed in the film is very complicated and one of the best actors in Korea Choi Minsik goes deep inside of Jang's soul. Suffering eyes reveal the struggle of a great artist's life.  He is very serious sometimes but all of sudden he changes to a wild maniac.  He drinks like an alcoholic and sleeps with courtesans anytime.  Even he said in the movie without an alcohol and a woman I can't draw. An alcohol and women are my only inspirations In the peak of the fame to develope his own style he travels all around the country and never gives up his pride as an artist for the authority or money.  I don't want to give out every details but I think you surely did get some ideas about the film.The most amazing thing about this film is a cinematography.  It is just so breathtaking how they captured every beauty of landscapes. Yes each scene is like a work of Jang's painting.  And the script is perfect too.  It mainly deals a deeper meaning of what makes a true artist.  For example Kim advices to Jang in the movie that 'before one holds a paintbrush one has to set an aim in life'.  This is very moving and inspiring line and there are many more.Go See this Film if you are going to be in the Canne Festival.Chihwasun will be the greatest film ever made that deals with the life of a painter in film history.".

	schema:reviewBody "The fire gives all...  This is one of film's most masterful meditations on artistry.  Set in 19th century Korea it tells the story of the famous painter Ohwon but rather than stick to saucy anecdote melodrama or psychological egg hunting it portrays a series of episodes throughout his life all of which are beautiful works of art in themselves.  It gives no interpretation of these episodes but leaves them for the viewer to ponder along with the paintings of Ohwon himself.  In this way the viewer enters into the same sort of contemplation as Ohwon and minus his talent can feel their way into the inspiration of his paintings.   Part of why this is so effective is the utterly masterful evocation of 19th century Korea and the musicalartistic world that Ohwon moved in. There are so many gorgeous shots of the world outside the paintings that we get a mirror effect where we see the beautiful world inspiring Ohwon Ohwon living and looking in that world and the works of art he creates all mirroring off one another.   The story is told with extreme economy. A feeling evoked is hardly ever lingered with or explained it just appears quickly then is gone for the next one to appear.  As an analogy it is a sort of Mozartian work of art endless and quick succession of great ideas rather than Beethovinian Obsessive lingering on one great idea.  It has a classical restraint much like Ohwon's paintings. There is really no music hinting how to feel except a few classical Korean pieces used with great effectiveness in several scenes and mostly played by characters in the movie.  One haunting image if I remember correctly is of a flock of birds soaring away over the blue mountains while a female singer croonsThis life is like a dream and only death will awaken us  One telling line of advice in the film from one of Ohwon's teachers is that the painting lies between the strokes.  The film follows that attitude as there is so much matter between what is spoken and described in the film.  I have seen it twice and it was very rewarding on the second viewing.  A very terse film with little in the way of obvert explanation one could see how it is Im's 96th film.  It is an artistic masterwork.  Like Ohwon's great friend and mentor tells him in describing one of his paintings Not a single stroke is wasted.  I compare it to Andrei Rubylev in quality though in style it is very different.  It is much easier and more directly entertaining to watch but classical in form where Andrei is gothic.  All in all highly recommended to almost anyone except appetite junkies. Both times I left the film I felt a wonderful spiritual renewal.  One point of Ohwon's life that intruiged me was that his mad drinking and raving began suddenly after visiting the noble who told him that Good art can come only from great knowledge and learning.  The next brief scene Ohwon was very angry and the next blasted drunk as he often remained for the remainder of the film.  I am curious why the nobles words effected him so much and drove him to the drinking that dominated the rest of his life. Or was it just a coincidence?".

	schema:reviewBody "Chihwaseong Painted Fire recounts the life of Korean painter Jang Seongub amidst the changing political landscape of late 19th century Korea.However the themes of this film center around the process of artistic creation through the fire of desire of the artist and the expectations and demands of their audience and society.Jang seongub is played masterfully as a complex character who changes from the innocent excitement of youth to a hardened alcoholic tortured soul. This characterization mirrors the young eager artist that finds it more and more difficult to invoke the spirit of artistic creation within himself without letting the creative fire out via drink erections and desire.Although this character development proceeds overall gradually through the film the emotional complexity of Jang is still played in a constantly oscillating manner building to the films' finale. Interestingly the montage of the film parallels this constantly changing and seemingly wild emotion or fire of the artist as scenes seamlessly transition from one time and location to another without any conventional 'cues' to the audience that such a scene change will occur. For example many scenes would change seemingly in mid conversation picking up at another point and location.The visual scenery of the film is presented beautifully and also oscillates from stark and perhaps bleak black and white scenery to more colorful and alive environments that again parallel the paintings of Jang either in simple black ink on white paper or with color added. Rainbows of color enter the film at points as the artist observes nature and especially women that then become reflected in his paintings.The theme of an artist's individual desire to create versus the expectations and demands of society arises in the film through various points including class distinction the domination of government over the artist the accepted norms of the artistic elite and the base desires of the common masses. Instead of creating his own completely original works Jang finds himself mostly recreating masterpieces of other artists throughout East Asia. The question thus arises if recreation itself deserves artistic merit.I wish that I was more familiar with the political events of the period to firmly grasp how they tied into the story  but beyond any comparison to the current role of Korean government in artistic expression andor censorship I cannot comment.Overall an extremely well acted film and the cinematography is often breathtaking. A great film to see and then ponder over.".

	schema:headline " How not to make a film about an artist...";
	schema:reviewBody "Nobody least of all me will argue about the visual beauty of this film. It is very well done with majestic scenes of nature as well as tight claustrophobic shots of a tormented man at work in his shuttered studio. As a period piece it comes across as very authentic and I give it high marks for its sets  costumes. So why didn't I like Painted Fire? Because I feel if you're going to do a film about an artist or musician or writer or poet of utmost importance is to convey exactly what drove inspired and influenced the artist.Excellent examples include Amadeus 1984 which showed Mozart being propelled by arrogance and perhaps moreso by his need to please andor escape his domineering father. Or Frida 2002 shows that Frida's Kahlo's grotesque often selfdeprecating sexual paintings were the result of her dysfunctional romance and sexual subversion by her husbandmentor Diego. These films seek to explain the idiosyncrasies of the artists' works by digging deep into the personality the psychology and the philosophies that drove the artist. That's why I like to watch films about artiststo get insight that we don't learn from textbooks.Here in Painted Fire it felt more like a textbook reading of the life of Ohwon. It shows his base beginnings as an orphan who in adolescence joins the house of an aristocrat. Abruptly jumping ahead 20 years it shows him as a frustrated drunk. He fights hard to divest himself of his vulgar origins but always swings back to his uncooth nature drinking womanizing. But why? What made him act the way he did? And how did it imprint the themes of his art? Not much of a connection is made the man is shown to suffer from demons but we are never shown what these demons are nor how they influenced his art. There are a few scenes where a peripheral character is whispering in the background about the symbolism in Ohwon's art The bird symbolizes freedom... but that's more of a broad cultural analysis rather than an analysis of Ohwon's psyche.I am a fan of Ohwon's paintings and have always been hypnotized by how beautifully he painted animals and the majesty of trees. In my mind I fashioned a painter who found great solace and order in nature while conspicuously avoiding human subjects. This could have been a great point to investigate in the film. Did he love animals? Did he fear humanity? None of this is in the film and none of his paintings are explained. We just see a drunk crass man who possesses a rare artistic talent. What a missed opportunity.Again contrast this against say a scene in Immortal Beloved where Beethoven's reclusive genius is exposed as the result of his shame of being deaf and struggling to keep it secret. At the same time Beethoven is shown to have a great capacity to love but explosively bitter when love is unrequited. In a scene he loses the love of his life because his carriage gets stuck in the mud on a stormy night and as we watch the man's torment we hear his music Apassionata in conjunction with the frantic beating of the horses' hooves. Every work of art has its particular motive and it's always fun to learn what that motive is.Painted Fire does not give us motive. It left all my questions about Ohwon unanswered presenting only a visual representation of what I already read in biographies. It gives us a good feel for what it was like to be alive in Korea in the late 1800s it paints the culture and political unrest of a nation in flux. But none of this really seems to affect Ohwon. He is just a particle awash in this cinematic sea.I can definitely see how it would win at Cannes because on a technical level it should wow any film connoisseur. But on a literary levelmeaning the act of telling a story and themeit did not satisfy me. For that I return to the works of Kurosawa Teshigahara and even modern Asian masters like Takeshi Kitano because I love their ability to incorporate cinematic prowess with the poetry of thought. Painted Fire was not an unpleasant experience but I can't say it did anything exceptionally good for me.".

Given the tumult of the time in which he painted and his own conflicted nature it is amazing that he produced so much work in so many styles and with such skill. This movie honors his talent while taking a direct look at his erratic and somewhat selfdestructive personality. The cinematography in MY opinion was beautiful many of the outdoor panoramic shots looked like Korean landscape paintings which I found a lovely conceit rather than overly arty and I think that Choi Minsik portrayed Jang Seunup with a necessary intensity and unpredictability. I would highly recommend this film to art lovers and movie lovers alike.".

Choi Minshik is good in acting out the temperamental artist and the supporting actors are good also. Ahn Sungki fits his role perfectly.The love scenes here were very very hot and one image out in the reeds will stick to my irises for a while.This is the kind of movie that should represent Korea abroad not the likes of 'Taegukgi'.

	schema:reviewBody "It is not surprising that this film was made by I'm Kwon Taek at the time it was. He examined the early beauty and tragedy of Chosun Dynasty life in Seopyonje and delightfully explored a wellknown Korean folk tale in Chunhyang and these comprised his last two films. What is most surprising is that Chi Hwa Seon his 2002 offering is not presented in the pansori style of those previous two films.Nonetheless the experienced hand of I'm comes through. We explore together the life of a real person a late nineteenth century Chosun Dynasty painter who rides on the edge of modernity but who is not a noble and who because of that causes a stir in contemporary Korean society with his fame and his public and artistic expressions of disdain for the old Korean noble class and his contempt for wouldbe Japanese ruling colonials alike. The painter Chang Seung Up known popularly as Oh Won performed magnificently by Choi Min Sik the famous star of Park Chan Wook's already legendary OldBoy becomes more and more influential and therefore more dangerous throughout the film. Contemporary Korean audiences will back a hero like this despite the fact or maybe because of the fact that he was so ostracized in his time. I'm's sense of simultaneous beauty and tragedy in history remains intact. I'm is a master at capturing his country's past idiosyncrasies and in this film he almost outdoes himself. As expected in an I'm film the cinematography is breathtaking the editing is precise and the story is central.Plots are set against Seung Up family ties are tested and broken scandalous behavior is alleged and is sometimes real all to bring down the man who painted fire. But against all the intricacies of I'm's detailed but sometimes convoluted account of Seung Up's life Seung Up himself somehow manages to survive. He becomes legendary because of his ability to perfectly copy famous Chinese paintings after only one look. Art dealers and agents then besiege him and try to make money off Oh Won. In other words lines of people who wish to take advantage of the real Seung Up an artistic star begin to form. But he refuses to be manipulated. His cleverness in staving off both the massive hordes and the imperial lackeys impresses the audience if not the cast. What does Seung Up think? He possesses powerful emotions and opinions about painting such as the aesthetic belief that paintings are living things and are never truly finished. He despises those who would try to turn art into profit. And he cares not for politicians who use their might to bring artistic beauty around them and then cast off the artist as traitorous. But he also thinks that painting plays a role in the coming upheavals. Horrid scenes involving foreign invaders from France and Japan are presented. I'm's signature historical epic motif and his influence in the realm remains on prominent display in this multimillion dollar epic. The protagonist causes greater grief for himself and those who care for him when he refuses to paint. This is when the story takes on a whole new meaning one that is not just political but social in nature. I'm takes on the issues in laudable realist fashion. He Oh Won becomes a Jesus figure. The people believe him capable of artistic miracles and the government feels it needs his artistic support but the protagonist remains fiercely independent and contemptuous of what others want him to do or be. Eventually both government and people come down upon Seung Up in a manner taken straight out of the Bible. His holiness becomes human his humanity is not accepted he dies for or escapes from the sins of the commoners the art critics the politicians who hound him. But does he die? As with most of I'm's films a question remains. In this case does Seung Up really become an immortal hermit? The film does not tackle that question it merely presents a possible end for the real man of Chang Seung Up or Oh Won. No death is depicted because no death is known. It is difficult to find fault with this film but I'm has become so good at presenting various historical absurdities in his culture that when he does it hardly surprises anymore. As usual for I'm's films the cinematography the editing and the writing are all first rate. It's a wellcrafted film imbued with I'm's uncanny storytelling ability. Granted he may be best at doing this through the ancient Korean musical art of pansori. Still the film contains stretches of this admirable art form and by the end viewers feel as if they have become privy to a great untold story. And they have because that precisely is I'm's gift.".

We explore together the life of a real person a late nineteenth century Chosun Dynasty painter who rides on the edge of modernity but who is not a noble and who because of that causes a stir in contemporary Korean society with his fame and his public and artistic expressions of disdain for the old Korean noble class and his contempt for wouldbe Japanese ruling colonials alike. The painter Chang Seung Up known popularly as Oh Won performed magnificently by Choi Min Sik the famous star of Park Chan Wook's already legendary OldBoy becomes more and more influential and therefore more dangerous throughout the film. Contemporary Korean audiences will back a hero like this despite the fact or maybe because of the fact that he was so ostracized in his time. I'm's sense of simultaneous beauty and tragedy in history remains intact. I'm is a master at capturing his country's past idiosyncrasies and in this film he almost outdoes himself. As expected in an I'm film the cinematography is breathtaking the editing is precise and the story is central.Plots are set against Seung Up family ties are tested and broken scandalous behavior is alleged and is sometimes real all to bring down the man who painted fire. But against all the intricacies of I'm's detailed but sometimes convoluted account of Seung Up's life Seung Up himself somehow manages to survive. He becomes legendary because of his ability to perfectly copy famous Chinese paintings after only one look. Art dealers and agents then besiege him and try to make money off Oh Won. In other words lines of people who wish to take advantage of the real Seung Up an artistic star begin to form. But he refuses to be manipulated. His cleverness in staving off both the massive hordes and the imperial lackeys impresses the audience if not the cast. What does Seung Up think? He possesses powerful emotions and opinions about painting such as the aesthetic belief that paintings are living things and are never truly finished. He despises those who would try to turn art into profit. And he cares not for politicians who use their might to bring artistic beauty around them and then cast off the artist as traitorous. But he also thinks that painting plays a role in the coming upheavals. Horrid scenes involving foreign invaders from France and Japan are presented. I'm's signature historical epic motif and his influence in the realm remains on prominent display in this multimillion dollar epic. The protagonist causes greater grief for himself and those who care for him when he refuses to paint. This is when the story takes on a whole new meaning one that is not just political but social in nature. I'm takes on the issues in laudable realist fashion. He Oh Won becomes a Jesus figure. The people believe him capable of artistic miracles and the government feels it needs his artistic support but the protagonist remains fiercely independent and contemptuous of what others want him to do or be. Eventually both government and people come down upon Seung Up in a manner taken straight out of the Bible. His holiness becomes human his humanity is not accepted he dies for or escapes from the sins of the commoners the art critics the politicians who hound him. But does he die? As with most of I'm's films a question remains. In this case does Seung Up really become an immortal hermit? The film does not tackle that question it merely presents a possible end for the real man of Chang Seung Up or Oh Won. No death is depicted because no death is known. It is difficult to find fault with this film but I'm has become so good at presenting various historical absurdities in his culture that when he does it hardly surprises anymore. As usual for I'm's films the cinematography the editing and the writing are all first rate. It's a wellcrafted film imbued with I'm's uncanny storytelling ability. Granted he may be best at doing this through the ancient Korean musical art of pansori. Still the film contains stretches of this admirable art form and by the end viewers feel as if they have become privy to a great untold story. And they have because that precisely is I'm's gift.";

It's not a movie that moved me but it was one that made me think about art and what it means to find your own voice in it. That's pretty cool. It's also interesting to see a version of Korea during those times right before the turn of the century where Chinese and Japanese powers are both in Korea and the Chosun kingdom is coming to an end. More than one revolution and political ideology are gathered in the film but are never the center. It's firmly on the painter.In the end it's a well made film about the life of a painter. But it doesn't exactly have the regular threeact structure plot so you have to be able to take a nonstandard Hollywood story to watch it. Yay for art! 810".

While all this didn't make him a particularly nice man it is important to capture on film so we understand a lot about the nature of the artist.I really found the movie fascinating and loved how the artists actual works were shown throughout the movie like in LUST FOR LIFE. I really wish I could show this to my students I teach at a school for the arts but can't because there is just too much adult material. Yes there is nudity but even more problematic for any audience particularly younger ones is when he....hmmm...I don't think IMDb will even let me describe what occurred but it was very graphic and involves bodily fluids.

	schema:reviewBody "Aachi and Ssipak is one film I've been wanting to see for a while now and lemme just say Wahoo! for it satisfied my expectations. But not for the poopiness but for the insane amount of violence and nods to famous film. Well the poopiness is also a plus.Story revolves around poop being the only? resource for energy addictive Popsicles called Juicybars which you're rewarded with if you make a poop and lots of little mutants who use JuicyBars as their means of provision. Oh you can throw in Aachi and Ssipak if you want but the real enjoyment comes from the violence you watch whenever the Diaper Gang is on screen. There is also a main villain who leads the Diaper Gang but at times you seem to root for him which was a nice touch. And then there is Geko one of the best fighting machines you'll ever see. He's only killing little blue freaks but hell those lil blue freaks carry uzi's and machine guns and Geko takes care of them without a stutter.Aachi and Ssipak was 23rds awesome violence and the other third is slightly tedious storyfiller. And weirdly that's when A and S are on screen. Sure they're in some of the fights but mainly they're second fiddles to the Villain and Geko and all the little blue freaks known as the Diaper Gang.Overall though this is a welcome addition to any fan of animation who likes the weird and violent as well. I dug the heck outta this film for it's unique animation style which seemed to combine the show DUCKMAN and the film AKIRA. And with a unique story good characters and great violence this is one flick I'm sure I'll be adding to my collection very soon.".

	schema:reviewBody "Aachi and Ssipak is a delightfully wicked piece of animation. It's full of fun and politically incorrect full of high octane action and set against a nonsensical background in the future. It's rude vulgar and totally unapologetic about it.In the future humans have learnt how to harness human waste to become rich sources of energy. As a result the government encourages everyone to defecate and collect their waste to power our world. To reward its population those who defecate are given juicybars as rewards when they do their business at designated collection points. However these juicybars they look so phallic when being sucked upon are addictive and here you have a black market churned from obtaining and selling these bars. With gangs one of the most notorious ones called The Diaper Gang come forth to wreck havoc on the populace and with the authorities not going to sit back and do nothing they unleash their cyborg policeman Geko to take them down violently.And all these happen in the first 5 minutes. Like I said it moves at breakneck speed infused with comedy and various pop movie references galore ranging from Pulp Fiction and the Untouchables to the obvious Robocop and a sequence taken straight out of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. If you thought that the Koreans had the most ultra realistic and violent movies in their crime genre this is also brought over to the animation field with this movie a showcase just how violent a cartoon can be  heads get shot off constantly and various dismemberment happen so often you'll start to want nothing less than a swift violent end for its characters in particularly the members of the Diaper Gang who serve as disposable fodder.So where does Aachi and Ssipak fit in you say? They're small time hoodlums who discover a girl called Beautiful whom I thought was anything but who has the capability to defecate and be rewarded bucketloads. As small time hoodlums they see this as a get rich opportunity and it becomes like a round robin hide and seek game amongst all the players involved.There are plenty of human waste jokes and references coupled with tons of swearing and showing of bad signs middle finger thumb in between fingers the flipping of the forearm etc and probably served as direct insolence to both the gangsters as well as to the V for Vendetta like fascist government and their polices.If you like your animations vulgar fun full of action and violence then Aachi and Ssipak will be right up your alley.".

	schema:reviewBody "Aachi and Ssipak is one of the new animated films coming from a foreign country and will probably be different bizarre life changing and overall will be praised by anime fans world wide.No not likely. It's actually a new animated film from Korea out of all those movies from Korea This would be the first and only one I've seen from the country. It's different and bizarre in that it's plot sounds something like Mad Max with Idiocracy Robocop and Demolition Man all compiled together. As for it being accepted by anime fans it all depends on if you like the story and animation.The Story takes place in an unknown future where all energy is now powered by defecation. Yes Human waste is what saves the world and supplies it with energy. The people who do this are rewarded with JuicyPops sort of like a Popsicle with almost drug inducing side effects the people get hooked on them and everyone loves them.As the movie kicks off it introduces the Diaper gang a group of mutants who can't excrete How I don't think is explained or yet not knowing how come they can't is a better use of words. but love the delicious Juicy Pops so much they hijack tankers carrying them to have them.Within the first two or three minutes this movie starts to go from a plot that John Waters could make with Adam Sandler and moves to something that Michael Bay could make with Adam Sandler as the movie goes from excretory humor to an almost nonstop bullet festival as we find these little monsters as well as average people want the delicious JuicyPops for financial and personal gain and ammunition is spent faster than a World War II movie as it turns into an all out brawl with a mixed up plot to see what happens next.Aachi and Ssipak are two poor guys whose lives are horrible they barely have a thing but their motorcycles to their names. A mixed up plot with a crappy movie director pun intended the evil leader of the Diaper gang the government Aachi and Ssipak and a girl known only as Beautiful becomes the rest of the plot.The plot is almost too crude to put into words and as I felt this movie would go nowhere it speeds up to an action plot and drops the comedy about 45 minutes in. At 1 hour and 24 minutes it just about wears out its welcome but because it drops off the bathroom humor about halfway through there is more plot to focus on which in this case means watching bullets fly and ridiculous story to commence.What does the movie provide to you though? Well for one it's not a date movie it made be animated but it's not for kids and it's violent yet cannot compare to Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira but how does it sit so well to be watched by anybody? If you look it at it's basically another film to be remade in America with some famous actors since The Ring Premonition and all these foreign films have been getting adapted to American Audiences give it to the Happy Gilmore production crew to make a new movie idea.It also felt like I could be watching the future. How? With Ethanol Global warming and other kinds of power for the future this movie feels like the future to me? Yes. I can't imagine we aren't much farther away from using defecation for something in society just have to find a scientist who says it's a great alternate fuel source or something to believe it.Still I'm recommending this movie. To who? Well You have to have a stomach for the plot be willing to watch something so weird that you'd think 14 year old came up with it and be willing to watch blood fly and have fight scenes that are so unreal The Matrix couldn't even have fight scenes of its magnitude in it.It's entirely inconceivable to make a movie like this but it has been made and you know what it's actually not that bad. Be prepared for some humor that will make you feel like you repeated 4th grade and fight scenes that are simply silly but it's still a good movie.I give it an 810 Or easily a 35.".

For some reason this type of humor never grows old to some folks but sticks itself into the collective psyches of many adults permanently.It was never my thing. So how did I end up watching this? Well for starters the whole movie is a not so subtle metaphor for society in general. The idea of breaking down the advanced and intricate systems of the world and then articulating it all in overly simplified terms is always a winning movie making formula to me.This movie is vaguely similar to a film called Equilibrium where the basic foundational idea of society is presented as a single statement Obliterate all human emotion to create the perfect society. The film then grows out of that idea. The plot grows organically as a result of trying to maintain the believability of the original idea.In the case of this film All energy comes from collecting human feces encourage the populace to defecate profusely. The idea is so simple it leaves you wondering immediately if there is more buried underneath it. Well unfortunately there isn't. The basic plot flow of this film is not original. It has been done before in hundreds of movies. It's very formulaic really. But it still works because of the setting.But no one is really watching for the plot. By now word has gotten around that this movie is violent as heck. It really is. Gore explosions torture.. it's got it all. DO NOT play a drinking game with this one especially if you need to drink every time someone dies. There are several sexual references so don't think this is appropriate for your kids. There's also some pretty creepy looking characters. The police Captain in particular was worthy of a cringe or two.The voice acting is acceptable if you are watching the English dubbed version but not great. The animation itself is somewhat difficult to follow from time to time characters wiggle like jello and bend like Gumby.All told the film holds itself together admirably and is very entertaining. It's not going to be a favorite of mine but I do not regret watching it. It was worth a watch.The only thing it doesn't have surprisingly is the actual showing of fecal matter. The mere reference to it is apparently enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "For what it's worth Aachi  Ssipak represents a stylistic and technical milestone for Korean animation. Now even if it might not be good or enjoyable it does manage to drop jaws in the sequences that do work. Quite obviously inspired by the glut of web animation on the Internet the film twines absurdity political lampoons and sexuality into an incoherent mess that's just much too energetic and maniacal to take your eyes off. In his simplest form it's about a ragtag crew of criminal elements caught in the middle of a war between the city's Big Sister government and a terrorist group called the Diaper Gang.

Now even if it might not be good or enjoyable it does manage to drop jaws in the sequences that do work. Quite obviously inspired by the glut of web animation on the Internet the film twines absurdity political lampoons and sexuality into an incoherent mess that's just much too energetic and maniacal to take your eyes off.

The power source of the future is human feces. And the state collects it and rewards the people with addictive juicy bars. The funniest characters are the ant like diaper gang members. They are the addicts of the drug that can be received after defecation. These poor guysgirls they have no longer any sex need the juicy bars but because they cannot defecate they have to find other ways to get the desired food. In their efforts they loose their live by the dozens. Mostly because of the cyborg police officer Geco. He is like Robocop defying the laws of physics mainly with unlimited ammo usage. The diaper gang calls themselves orphans of the city. Their small size and as they act I think they are like kids turned into addicts. Despite the original story that they were normal citizens. The rest of the characters are bad guys too Aachi and Ssipak are always arguing on something. They are marauders attacking people on the toilet. Beautiful the woman is a porn star or prostitute. The leader of the police is much like an angry chiwawa a little blonde girl shouting with her inferior officers.Overall lots of action lots of location good storyline weird ideas.".

I'll name a few unacceptable things.1 The Diaper GangIt is a complete failure first of all in art design  come on we made much cooler pictures of villains at school though we did it just for fun. And here the Korean guys earn money by THIS? Such green little onedimension figures with UZIguns or whatever. However much blood you draw when representing their deaths this will always look like a drawing of a spoilt kindergarten child or a violent grownup moron. The characters of Beavis  Butthead were at least funny at times and quite friendly. I mention The Diaper Gang because it is a key element in the flick. It occupies the majority of this feature and that's very irritating to watch this moronic daub.2 Scenes remakesremixes and concepts from other moviesThe Korean guys are stealing concepts from Alien Mad Max Indiana Jones Basic Instinct and RoboCop just to name most obvious borrowings. Should I say that the tree mentioned films are cult classics and will be remembered by the movie fans forever? It all looks and feels that these Korean guys have nothing to say and the only thing they can do is stealing other men's ideas.3 Satanic materialYes you see it correctly. What is it if not satanic material that goes at the beginning of the cartoon? Quite possibly the creators of this newwave entertainment are the followers of some satanic cult because a more a less normal person even an atheist would have never used such provoking images in a film and would have never promoted this kind of popart so fiercely.4 Unfunny comedy elementsCannot name even one funny scene they are either too rude and sinister or too stupid and interfering.Korea should be ashamed for promoting such poor product. It made the situation even more uncomfortable as I watched the promos and advertisement material on the DVD little kids smiling Korean girl shouting something like Ssipak!!! guys waiving with flags etc.  it really makes me doubt the Koreans in general. Let's just say that they look very awkward promoting this kind of video product. Maybe you'd point out It's just a little funnysilly cartoon take it easy! And I'd say No dear viewers what we have here is an abomination which should have never been born. Entertainment however wicked and silly should have some boundaries and you know it.So if you like artless projects enjoy satanism and are in love with poor remakesremixes of the good movies go for it! You'll love this one.I still hope that those happy gals guys and children which were promoting this abominoanimation had not actually seen it and were paid for their Hoorah! words. Otherwise Korea SOUTH is in big trouble to cherish and advertise rotten products like this. I could not believe my eyes when they showed a little kid of about 5 years old who was supposed to represent the praise of this cartoon. Did the Koreans suggest that even such children could watch and enjoy THIS? Is it a PG material in their country?As mentioned above the background plot is good. I really think so. And this feature shows vividly how an original plot can go down the toilet. They could have done a groovy postapocalyptic drama. But that requires real talent like that of John Carpenter James Cameron Ridley Scott and George Miller  something that these SouthKorean guys and girls are missing so badlyIf you want a real gem of Korean cinema go get Hong kil dong 1986. But that's North Korea  militant poor rejected by the World's Greatest Empires etc. And what does South Korea with all its tons of money and luxurious living conditions produce? Read the review from the beginning  that's what. Sad but true1 out of 10 and keep your children far away from this dung. Thanks for attention.".

When I was told it was about a 15year old girl dealing with puberty I wasn't very happy about it. But then what I saw surprised me. During the first 2 minutes I prepared myself for two hours of overdone artistic cinema. But after some time I got into it and even got attached to the girl who everybody just calls Its. However according to the director this film may have been shot in only 14 days but it took them about nine months to edit it. No wonder since the director Bruce McDonald took the Fragmentpart of the title by word. The film consists of hundreds of fragments of pictures each showing different perspectives of the same moment mixing up reality and thoughts and fantasies of Tracy the 15year old protagonist. There are only rare scenes in which there are less then 3 fragments to be seen on screen. And the more emotional the protagonist gets the more fragments appear. So thus confusing you with just too much information it leaves you overwhelmed with impressions and emotions that are just too plenteous to handle. Off course McDonald did this on purpose. It's all just a try to visualize what a teen must have to go through in puberty. After a while you get sucked into a world of bullies disturbed parents unanswered love doubts and fantasies sympathizing more and more with Tracy. Even though it was exhausting to pay attention all the time I'd say the film is worth seeing if you have the stamina. I have seen a lot of movies but this one was actually something new. Well it may be exhausting but when you think of it wasn't puberty too?!".

This allows the viewer to watch the movie in many different perspectives. Where this can be confusing at times I found it wonderful and unique! I had such a blast watching this movie and trying to see every frame at least once.The beginning of the movie will leave your head spinning for a good 2030 minutes. Picture an empty timeline and as the movie progresses you get to know a little from the beginning a little from the end a little of the middle and repeat it until the movie finishes. It's bizarre but an experience.One great portion of the film are the little scenes when you get dumped into Tracey's fantasy world. Sometimes you can tell it's a fantasy and sometimes you cannot. However this then leads the viewer to wonder if future scenes are real or just a fantasy.The highlight of the film in my opinion is Tracey's 'back of the bus' confessions. Throughout the movie Tracey will pop in the movie dressed in a shower curtain and give a little hint or just some insight into her somewhat confused mind. It gives you a short break from the nonlinear chaos of the film and sometimes will give you a chuckle.All in all Ellen Page yet again shows how great of an actor she really is. Her acting in this movie blows Hard Candy and Juno out of the water! The movie is all about her and I don't believe that there isn't a scene without her. I find this great because you can truly focus on the main character and her story rather than any subplots or supporting character development. The Tracey Fragments is a must see film!!".

At first glance the picture may seem annoyingly pretentious due to its very original picture composition. And in some ways it IS annoying. But the amazing thing is it works pretty well. It really does compose the delicate mysterious tune which is the nerve of this fine movie.Some people might think that The Tracey Fragments would benefit from a more explicit epic narrative. But the artistic mist is also the movie's strength and I certainly did enjoy this mystery. So give it a chance even if you're a bit amazed by all the flashing frames. It's actually possible to follow the storyline even if the intentional nonclarity of this flick is not mastered completely.Having said all that Ellen Page as Tracey is a very very good choice!".

	schema:reviewBody "There is so much I could say about The Tracey Fragments it is almost like a really big and scary looking roller coaster its definitely not for everyone but those that like it love it.I will start with what i noticed first the fragments the split screen super impositions whatever you want to call it the editing. Its original but there is a reason for that all of these constant different visuals at the same time is exhausting at first. 10 minutes into the movie all i wanted was a complete shot with none of those extras that you eventually get used to. 45 minutes into the movie though i was completely engrossed in the story and totally understood the director's reason for all of that stuff. And the reason is simple it allows the audience to get inside the head of this alone and suffering teenager.I am a teen myself and I thought that the bullying and the family life and the emotions Tracey experiences are pretty realistic and flawlessly portrayed by Ellen Page. This is what life is like for some teens sadly.The script was I thought perfect. It is dark and disturbing and mostly pretty realistic and most importantly or annoyingly it is very disjointed you watch the story unfold but you don't figure out what is real and what isn't and how it all happened and why until the end.The soundtrack is amazing I loved it and it fits perfectly I am not a fan of Broken Social Scene who scored the film but I am definitely going to be looking for the soundtrack when i get some time.This movie is Canadian and that makes me proud. This was shot in Toronto and it was beautiful they seemed to find the perfect location for every shot and the director is Canadian and Ellen Page is Canadian and etc.Finally Ellen Page. I have saved this for the end because she is the best part of this movie. She is one of my favorite actors and the reason why I decided to see this movie in the first place. She is fantastic portraying the life of this 15 year old Tracey perfectly. her performance was flawless and there was not a moment in the film where I wasn't totally believing her or cheering on Tracey as we as the audience learn more about her. I could go on forever but simply put she is so great so talented.".

You are the one to edit to movie to decide whether you want the see the long or the close shot. I found this a very interesting approach to the process of making a movie. But still sometimes the film seems to be so random trying hard to be special and smart. You might have to watch it a second time to really check if there's is a kind of inner logic to every scene. The movie has great moments and is full of original ideas though sometimes it is only original for the purpose of being original and nothing else.

I'm looking forward to her future projects.".

	schema:reviewBody "If it's true as Marshall McLuhan has suggested that the medium is indeed the message then The Tracey Fragments proves that theory in spades. This highly idiosyncratic work has as its focal point Tracey Berkowitz  15  just another girl who hates herself  a description that comes straight from the mouth of Ms. Berkowitz herself. Tracey is a deeply unhappy youngster who hates her admittedly horrible parents is terrorized by all the cool kids in school for insufficient mammarygland development spends most of her nights riding the subway hooks up with a psychotic lowlife who turns out to be a drug dealer and searches for her little brother whom she's hypnotized into thinking he's a dog and who goes missing by a frozen river when she's supposed to be watching out for him. To help mitigate her misery Tracey also dreams of having a relationship with a brooding emo bad boy at school and fantasizes that she is a famous universally worshipped rock star.But it is not Tracey's story that is of primary interest here rather it's the cutandpaste filmmaking style director Bruce McDonald has employed to create a sense of fragmentation and dislocation in the viewer  intended obviously to mirror the highly chaotic and disordered nature of Tracey's world and life. With rare exceptions the screen is occupied by as few as two and as many as a dozen shots at a time often portraying the same sequence from slightly different angles or at slightly different moments in time or portraying thematically related scenes simultaneously. The question inevitably arises is the approach effective in what it's trying to accomplish or does it serve as a distancing device for those of us who are trying to enter into Tracey's mind and world. I imagine that different viewers will come to varying verdicts on that point.Personally I appreciate what McDonald is trying to do here more than I admire it. The Tracey Fragments which Maureen Medved has adapted from her own novel offers many probing insights into the subject of teenage angst particularly as regards the tremendous pressure modern young people are put under to measure up and conform to some arbitrarily agreedupon social standard. And Juno's Ellen Page gives a stunning performance as the young woman caught in an evertightening web of selfhatred this is in many ways the darker side of Juno and Page is much less mannered in this role.But frankly the movie probably would have been more moving and involving without all the migraineinducing imagery which succeeds mainly in throwing us out of the story. In fact there is only one scene in which the split screen technique actually serves a narrative purpose  and that is when Tracey is hiding behind a curtain while her drugdealer friend is being savagely beaten by the irate boss to whom he owes money. Most of the rest of the time the approach feels more like a gimmick designed to separate this film from the rest of the distressedteen indie pack than an artistically viable choice in its own right.Still if you can get past all the artiness and visual distraction you might just find in The Tracey Fragments a thoughtful sensitive and ineffably sad glimpse into a young woman's heart.".

A bullied and misanthropic youngster who never really fits in to either her family or school Tracey takes on a journey as she searches for her brother but also herself at the same time.The Tracey Fragments is indeed just that with the same told from multiple angles in a single frame onscreen that convey Tracey's fractured mind family and life. For the most part the technique works and actually conveys a lot of meaning particularly in the family scenes. In whatever context it's used it rarely feels like just a gimmick.Furthermore there is the film's representation of it's heroine. Many bad things happen to Tracey Berkowitz and yet although her plight is moving at times her selfish actions and carelessness prevent the audience from sympathizing with her completely and this keeps the film from being overly sentimental. That said however the tone is unrelentingly remorseless and without much humour to lighten it up things tend to drag at times.Page as ever leads the way with another complex performance probably her best to my mind along with Hard Candy. She isn't quite strong enough to hold the long shot at the very end of the film but otherwise she's excellent. Page is well supported by a solid supporting cast and some strong direction by Bruce McDonald.This film is not a light or fun viewing experience but is certainly one of a kind in it's technique and performances and is worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tracey Fragments is a very experimental film. 95 of the film is shot with two or more screens. Sometimes it's even split up as much as 100 screens! Not often do you see a film where there is more art in the editing than anything else in the film. In fact some of the split screens act as shattered glass which seemed to be the symbolic meaning of the film where a girl's life is pretty much shattered throughout the film.Tracey Berkowitz played by Ellen page is a fifteen year old girl who thought it would be funny to hypnotize her brother into being a dog. She hates her parents and her school mates. She dreams of starting a rock band with the boy of her dreams Billy Zero. Very independent she decides to run away from home to look for her brother. there she has her day from hell.The first thing I'd like to comment about the film is I thought the script lacked. Ellen Page made this movie watchable but I disliked some of the scenes. In fact some parts were so ridiculous it almost made me laugh nervously as if they were trying to make the movie corny at times. With that said I'd have to say that Bruce McDonald did a very good job capturing Tracey with the budget that he had. It's obvious that the film was shot with a handheld camera but it fit very well with the dark behavior and life that Tracey endured throughout the movie. I also loved the score. I read on one of the message boards for this movie that some replied that they loved and hated this movie. I agree. Some parts were so beautifully captured while some seems completely lacked and didn't fit once again the lacking script. The movie is exhausting at times but the last thirty minutes began to pick up again and make the movie interesting.Ellen Page is a versatile actress and I like her a lot more when she plays darker roles such as this movie and her best performance to date Hard Candy. I did love Juno but I like these type of roles more. The most memorial seen in the movie is when she stares her mom down and points her finger in her face while screaming at her. It's almost freaky but so well done.If you love Ellen Page this movie and Mouth to Mouth need to be seen with an open mind. 77 minutes of this film could feel like two hours.My verdict 6.2510".

It's obvious that the film was shot with a handheld camera but it fit very well with the dark behavior and life that Tracey endured throughout the movie. I also loved the score. I read on one of the message boards for this movie that some replied that they loved and hated this movie. I agree. Some parts were so beautifully captured while some seems completely lacked and didn't fit once again the lacking script. The movie is exhausting at times but the last thirty minutes began to pick up again and make the movie interesting.Ellen Page is a versatile actress and I like her a lot more when she plays darker roles such as this movie and her best performance to date Hard Candy. I did love Juno but I like these type of roles more. The most memorial seen in the movie is when she stares her mom down and points her finger in her face while screaming at her. It's almost freaky but so well done.If you love Ellen Page this movie and Mouth to Mouth need to be seen with an open mind. 77 minutes of this film could feel like two hours.My verdict 6.2510";

She has left home is looking for her missing little brother Sonny and is in trouble.We are drawn into Tracey's chaotic mind and soul but also towards her path of growth from child to woman from fairytale worlds to harsh reality and acceptance of the self. This is a very interesting story about a teenager that is not pretty cleaver or happy. Although this is a movie about teenagers there is nothing sweet about it as presents very hard topics rape bullying loneliness lack of selfesteem confused selfimage delusional thoughts insecurity and mental trouble.Tracey's memory fragments and thoughts appear in miniscreens within the screen and on splitscreen images which show different angles of the same scene or different scenes altogether. The nonlinear narrative is very challenging. Pay extra attention to the first 1520 minutes of the film because they are the most difficult and the ones that really give clues to understand many of the things that happen later on.The film is more complex visually at the beginning when Tracey's mind and emotions are more confused and becomes simpler and more linear at the same pace that Tracey's mind clears to be completely linear at the end when she accepts herself and the events related to Sonny. In other words Tracey's troubled mind and emotions are directly linked to the way the movie is visually organized. The movie is also full of symbolic psychoanalytical elements from the gender of Tracey's psychiatrist and the settings in which the consultation happens to the appearance of different animals a crow a horse and a dog to the way the scenes have been patched and shown to the viewer.Ellen Page is fantastic despite the dramatic demands of her character. She was 20 when the film was shot but she is believable as a 15y.o. girl. That's not only her physique is the great actress she is. The rest of the cast are OK in their respective roles Ari Cohen and Erin McMurtry as Mr  Mrs Berkowitz Zie Souwand as sweet Sonny Toronto Songwriter and performer Slim Twigg as jerk Billy Zero Julain Richings as Dr Heker among others.A few important flaws ruined what could have been a great movie. The main idea is brilliant but since we get mostly Tracey's subjective approach to reality the rest of the characters are somewhat pointless and can't be trusted by the viewer in fact they are just hinted. I did not like the end not the way it ended but how the end was presented and how we get there  what triggers Tracey's epiphany? That is so because the mood of the movie and most importantly its tempo were not the right ones.This is one of those movies that are a challenge for the viewers that need of their full awareness and attention that have a difficult knot to untie but also one of those movies that can be interpreted in different ways and make your brain produce sparks. One of those movies that you get or you don't nothing in between. To me one of those movies that the more I think about it the more I want to watch again.Are you ready for it?".

	schema:reviewBody "Ever notice whenever a work of art is referred to as experimental it usually sucks? Not so here if The Tracey Fragments is indeed experimental I'd have to say the experiment produced successful results. The gimmick here is that the entire film is presented with multiple cameras showing different fragments of Tracey's memories.In the DVD bonus feature director Bruce McDonald says he used this method to convey the nature of memories. And true if you think about it how often do you have a memory that plays out like a linear story? Most often memories jump back  forth focus on different objects change perspective and become intertwined with other memories.If you're ready for a disorienting experience like this then you'll enjoy this movie because while being difficult to digest it's ultimately a rewarding experience. Tracey expertly played by Ellen Page is a 15yearold outcast who is constantly ridiculed  abused by schoolmates parents and strangers. The movie recounts 2 or 3 intense days in her life beginning with the story of her missing brother jumping back to a few days before and eventually coming full circle and then beyond. While the story itself is linear the narration through Tracey's memories is anything but linear and the multiple cameras add a deeper dimension of confusion.But whether you grasp every individual camera  scene or not the story unfolds clearly and by the end we are aware of what happened with a few dramatic surprises to boot. Although I hate the phrase coming of age story because it conjures up images of extreme boredom and sappiness this movie is a great gritty powerful coming of age story. It's a lot like how I would imagine the book Catcher in the Rye with its seemingly random episodes that are glued together by a common theme. In the case of The Tracey Fragments much like Catcher the theme is about a young adolescent who sees himselfherself as the protector of a younger child however the protector herself is coming apart from the strain of protecting innocence while losing her own innocence.Although the character Tracey is a lot like Ellen Page's character in Juno as well as her character in Whip It don't expect the same quirky humor because The Tracey Fragments is much darker and sometimes disturbing. You might crack a smile at some scenes and she does have a few great sarcastic lines but mostly this is a heavy drama with an emphasis on weird.There aren't many films I can compare this to but one that comes to mind is the excellent Man of the Year 2002 starring John Ritter a movie featuring about 2 dozen actors and 2 dozen cameras filming simultaneously in real time. Another film I'm reminded of is Pi 1998 the directoral debut of Darren Aronofsky who also did Requiem for a Dream The Fountain and Black Swan. If you like dark films like those with unusual visual styles give this one a whirl.".

Imagine your basic ahead of the curve student writing a somewhat bent screenplay an inexperienced director turning Page loose to interpret her character without the help of acting for the camera direction and the entire film class piling into the computer lab to slice and dice the thing in postproduction hoping that thousands of hours of digital editing can add some value to the minimalist production.If the idea sounds like fun it probably was and the end product should please its narrow target audience of film buffs Page fans and assorted offkilter types. The Tracey Fragments is a blend of Ghost World 2001 and Gummo 1997 imagine a dumbeddown Enid Birch transplanted to Xenia Ohio.This comingofage story is selfindulgent with a screenplay chock full of symbolism a chopped up timeline and frameinframe effects can you say fragments that call attention to themselves. But in this case it is not a bad thing if you don't find the whole package entertaining you can just focus on the inventive style and on what it tells you about film theory and how viewers expect to read a film.Tracey Berkowitz the slackjawed title character has a secret. She seems to have misplaced her little brother Sonny and the film elliptically reveals the story of Sonny's disappearance and Tracey miserable existence with the disparate story fragments connected by Tracey's odyssey around town in a bus. But film conventions are not followed and it is impossible to tell which segments are real and which ones are figments of Tracey's imagination. Ultimately the viewer is left to wonder if there ever was a Sonny that he may simply represent Tracey's lossofinnocence in what may otherwise be a very traditional comingofage tale. By the end we see that her coping mechanism seems to have worked and they go out on a character who probably has come to terms with her reluctant nudge into an adult world a world that she already finds disappointing but one which will be tolerable because of her low expectations.Then again what do I know?

It's got that postmodern outoforder storytelling technique  a la Quentin Tarantino or Charlie Kaufman  that I love. And yet with it's fragmented multiframed editing style it dared to go deeper into this technique than either of those writers have ever done allowing two different stories to occur simultaneously by juxtaposing scenes from different points in time and different settings. this style also allowed the director to use different takes of the same action simultaneously repeat shots show events happening from completely different angles focus on multiple things and characters at the same time highlight small details allow the scene to play out at different speeds and sometimes just completely disorient the audience. Each technique had its own unique effect and was never ever overused or clichd.On top of this was an excellent performance by Ellen Page her best so far in her career. She's been perfect in the roles I've seen her do  Hard Candy and Juno  but I knew she was capable of much more. Hard Candy was a little unbelievable and Juno was not much more than entertaining. But Tracey I think is the kind of role I've been waiting to see from her and she did it better than I think any actress could have done. This was a full character realistically written with a whole array of emotions and she did an outstanding job with it.I'm really disappointed to see so many viewers who just couldn't appreciate it due to the visual technique. I think many were just bothered by the fact that there was so much to see and they didn't know what to pay attention to. No you couldn't pay attention to all of it at once but that's the point. I like art that isn't spoonfed to me that I can come back to and notice something different every time and this is that kind of movie. Most films make it too clear what you're supposed to pay attention to but this one gave you the power to choose. Sometimes I appreciated the entire composition sometimes I just focused on one little detail but isn't that what you're supposed to do with any film? In that sense appreciating this work of art really isn't that different than any other.I would recommend this film to anyone with an open mind and an interest in the avantgarde or experimental.".

Sometimes I appreciated the entire composition sometimes I just focused on one little detail but isn't that what you're supposed to do with any film? In that sense appreciating this work of art really isn't that different than any other.I would recommend this film to anyone with an open mind and an interest in the avantgarde or experimental.";

This Bruce McDonald movie proves that Ms. Page is a natural honest combustible and believable actress. It may take a while to get used to THE TRACEY FRAGMENTS shot not in just split screen but if you will... fragmented screens. The story line is also fragmented and after a half hour or so you are already involved.Page plays 15yearold Tracey Berkowitz who comes from a very screwed up family to say the least. Being a little underdeveloped in the breast area Tracey is humiliated at school and nobody really knows the confused girl inside. She is punished at home with a three month grounding for telling off her crossdressing shrinkJulian Richings. But independent Tracey runs away in search for her little brother SonnyZie Souward who has strayed from home thinking he is a...dog. Damn can this get a little more weird. There is the unnerving photographic technique to get used too. Some will complain about the extremely strong language. Although there is a walk in the park this movie is no picnic. There is this feeling of darkness and raw bitter cold. OK Ms. Page is the movie's redemption. Also in the cast Maxwell McCabeLokos Ari Cohen and Slim Twig.".

	schema:reviewBody "httpeattheblinds.blogspot.comYou can put lipstick on a pig but it's still a pig. As of late this phrase has been frontpage headlines for all the wrong reasons but regardless the meaning behind it stays the same. For all intents and purposes Bruce McDonald's The Tracey Fragments is a melodrama of AfterSchool Special proportions regardless of how hard the director and his editor try to dress it up as something more profound. Fragmented images act as multiple windows forming an endlessly elaborate collage peering into the dark recesses of 15 yearold Tracey Berkowitz's life and mind. This technique has been around for decades it's origins forever tied to the annals of experimental filmmaking. Long before Bruce McDonald the work of Stan Brakhage the most prolific and famed of all experimentalists was coopted by music videos directors who made famous the disjointed stylistic flourishes common to MTV in the 1980's. TTF looks and feels more like a music video than a conventional narrative film and since most kids who grew up on music videos have come of age stylistically TTF cannot define itself as anything new.But amidst a mine field of cookie cutter Hollywood films TTF does manage to distinguish itself as something more than the melodrama it merely is. If you can make it through the first 20minutes you'll be rewarded since at this point there seems to be a departure from the conventions of story telling into the hyperpersonal interior realm of a 15 yearold kid struggling with herself her family and the unforgiving world around her. This portrayal may be framed within the plot driven melodrama but McDonald reaches beyond plot by emphasizing the impressionistic quality of the visual collage he has painstakingly cobbled together. This is when the film becomes interesting when the visuals take over and expand the film watching experience into something haunting and poetic. The dreariness and drab of Tracey's lowerclass life transcends into something beautiful as each frame of her collage acts as a window into her soul. Ultimately TTF's greatest asset is it's ability to effectively portray the mixed up mind of a teenager who is desperately trying to make sense of her world. We've all been there and we've all lived it now you can relive the experience only this time without the acne scars.".

At first audience may become confused but in the end everyone will agree that he has done a wonderful job with the storytelling. This film also presented some realistic and rare to be seen condition of cities in Canada at night and twilight moment. The environments blend perfectly with the plot and storyline. However this film is lacking on one real solid ending to close this great work.This film is really a work of art in filmography the acting quality the storytelling time line and the multiple camera angle are very unique. However just like every other arts it is up to every person interpretation. Some people will say that the multiframes doesn't really work and they doesn't understand the movie at all.

Glenn is the bestknown of the three but had the least lines in here. Forsythe was good at playing what he does best the nasty villain.This movie was also wellfilmed with some nice closeup and camera angles.

	schema:reviewBody "You cannot see the trees for the testosterone in director Dean Semler's synthetic outdoors action saga Firestorm starring sportscaster Howie Long as a stalwart smoke jumper who parachutes into raging Wyoming forest fires to rescue little gals and grownup gals from getting cremated. Any sparks that Howie ignited as an actor in John Woo's Broken Arrow sputter in Firestorm with Long's pulp diction performance. Chris Soth's onedimensional script doesn't help Howie much as escaped convicts and flaming infernos challenge his physical prowess. There is nothing compelling about Howie's character and his charisma cannot compensate for this monolithic hero. Leanly plotted as a sapling but predictable as a plunging redwood Firestorm kindles minimal excitement with its prefabricated plot and Howie's Styrofoam heroics. Of course juvenileminded audiences who don't demand much from their cinematic exercises may find this halftoasted tale tolerable.What modicum of merit the movie musters lies in its premise. Ultraviolent villain Randy Earl Shaye William Forsythe of Once Upon A Time in America cons his shyster lawyer Terry Kelly of Christina into committing wildfire arson. Shaye wants out of the Wyoming State Penitentiary to get his 20million. It seems that the prison dispatches shorttime convicts to help extinguish forest fires. Shaye plans to use the forest fire as a cover for his escape. Stabbing a friendly prisoner on the fire detail Shaye disguises himself as the dead man and then sneaks out of the joint. Soth asks us to believe that a man could escape from prison based largely on a tattoo worn behind the ear.As villains go Shaye shows early promise as a worthy adversary until the filmmakers contrive obvious flaws in his character that assure his mortality. Veteran heavy William Forsythe supplies appropriate plugugly menace as Randy Earl Shaye. When we initially see Shaye he resembles Sean Connery from the The Rock with a beard and blond messianic coiffure. The filmmakers emphasize Shaye's villainy by showing not only the character of Shaye but also Forsythe's sneering face together in the same shot with the man that he kills. Driving the point home director Dean Semler wants audiences to realize that Shaye is clearly an unrepentant sadist. Sadly the events of the plot turn more on Shaye's sadism than on his criminal ingenuity. Shaye's comeuppance is horribly graphic but richly deserved for his murderous demeanor.Firestorm follows clenchjawed Jesse Graves exRaiders football star Howie Long as he thwarts Shaye's escape. The Spartan Chris Soth screenplay tosses in a woman to liven things up. Titanic supporting player Suzy Amis appears here as Jennifer an ornithologist who finds herself trapped by the wildfire blaze. Fleeing from the fire she runs smack into Randy Earl and his armed and stupid henchmen masquerading as Canadian firefighters. You must have stupid henchmen in Firestorm so that they can brag about their means of escape. When Jennifer finally gets away Shaye cannot afford to let her live because she knows his plans.Meanwhile when Jesse learns about the forest fire he skydives into it singlehandedly. He stumbles into Shaye Jennifer and Shaye's other henchmen. In other words Firestorm constantly moves ahead in terms of storytelling but with little efficiency plausibility or imagination. When Shaye tries his bogus Canadian firefighters story out Jesse is neither impressed nor convinced. Matching fists and wits with Shaye's motley crew our brawny firefighter hero sneaks off with Jennifer and they evade Randy Earl until a climactic fight on a lake about to be engulfed in a withering blaze.Firestorm derives its title from the phenomenon which occurs when two fires collide and suck all of the oxygen out of the air creating one of Mother Nature's nasty nuclearstyle blasts which destroys everything in it. Soth's script contains those suitable elements that any decent heman actioneer should boast. The effect however is less than incendiary. The problem with Soth along with uncredited scenarist Graham Yost of Speed and Hard Target is that their characters are a poorly developed bundle of stick figures with neither depth nor complexity. Randy Earl Shaye is supposed to be a homicidal genius who goes so far as to impersonate a prisoner brutally killing the convict by stabbing him in the neck but doesn't know squat about forest fires. Jennifer claims to be the offspring of a third generation Marine. Boasting that she can field strip automatic weapons like an AK47 she fails to notice that the autopistol that she swiped from a sex offender isn't loaded.Firestorm does other things wrong too. A neat gimmickpingpong balls that explode to start firesis lamely utilized. The first time that they use it as a trick during a pingpong game and the second time Howie uses it to start a backfire to divert oxygen from the first fire. But the pingpong balls disappear afterward never to be used again. There is a running joke about axes that the filmmakers bungle too. At one point in the plot Jesse and Jennifer lay a trap for Shaye and his sexpredator henchmen that goes afoul because it is so ineptly planned with halfbaked results! The only surprises in Firestorm are provided by rugged Scott Glenn as battleweary smoke jumper Wynt Perkins who is crippled while rescuing a dog from a burning house. Revealing more about his role and character would cut down on what little energy Firestorm contrives. Sentimentality drips off the script at points especially at the end when Jennifer learns that she has been incubating two bird eggs during this maelstrom of action.Dances with Wolves Oscarwinning photographer Dean Semler makes his less than inflammatory directorial debut with Firestorm. When he takes his cameras up for aerial shots of British Columbia you find your breath catching in your throat. Sadly Semler doesn't breath the same magic into the thin adolescent storyline. The special effects of the firestorm aren't that imaginative. You feel like you're trapped by expensive looking computer graphics instead of a real wildfire.".

Soth's script contains those suitable elements that any decent heman actioneer should boast. The effect however is less than incendiary. The problem with Soth along with uncredited scenarist Graham Yost of Speed and Hard Target is that their characters are a poorly developed bundle of stick figures with neither depth nor complexity. Randy Earl Shaye is supposed to be a homicidal genius who goes so far as to impersonate a prisoner brutally killing the convict by stabbing him in the neck but doesn't know squat about forest fires. Jennifer claims to be the offspring of a third generation Marine. Boasting that she can field strip automatic weapons like an AK47 she fails to notice that the autopistol that she swiped from a sex offender isn't loaded.Firestorm does other things wrong too. A neat gimmickpingpong balls that explode to start firesis lamely utilized. The first time that they use it as a trick during a pingpong game and the second time Howie uses it to start a backfire to divert oxygen from the first fire. But the pingpong balls disappear afterward never to be used again. There is a running joke about axes that the filmmakers bungle too. At one point in the plot Jesse and Jennifer lay a trap for Shaye and his sexpredator henchmen that goes afoul because it is so ineptly planned with halfbaked results! The only surprises in Firestorm are provided by rugged Scott Glenn as battleweary smoke jumper Wynt Perkins who is crippled while rescuing a dog from a burning house. Revealing more about his role and character would cut down on what little energy Firestorm contrives. Sentimentality drips off the script at points especially at the end when Jennifer learns that she has been incubating two bird eggs during this maelstrom of action.Dances with Wolves Oscarwinning photographer Dean Semler makes his less than inflammatory directorial debut with Firestorm. When he takes his cameras up for aerial shots of British Columbia you find your breath catching in your throat. Sadly Semler doesn't breath the same magic into the thin adolescent storyline. The special effects of the firestorm aren't that imaginative. You feel like you're trapped by expensive looking computer graphics instead of a real wildfire.";

I was a little saddened to see Scott Glenn in such an underwritten role.  Honest to god the man does have talent.  I've seen it. Here he only pops up long enough for you to forget about him and then to pop up again for some sort of suprise plot twist anyone ever see Backdraft?.  Aside from the movie's unforgivable flaws bad script weak melodrama PLOT HOLES half hearted acting etc. it does have a redeeming factor or two  the fire scenes were extremely well done and I really enjoyed the mountain scenery.

The script itself makes you wonder why there are so many struggling writers in hollywood while people are actually paid to write bile like this.  I was a little saddened to see Scott Glenn in such an underwritten role.  Honest to god the man does have talent.  I've seen it. Here he only pops up long enough for you to forget about him and then to pop up again for some sort of suprise plot twist anyone ever see Backdraft?.  Aside from the movie's unforgivable flaws bad script weak melodrama PLOT HOLES half hearted acting etc. it does have a redeeming factor or two  the fire scenes were extremely well done and I really enjoyed the mountain scenery.

The only thing about the movie that didn't ring true aviation wise was that before leaving Boise he didn't perform a preflight inspection of the aircraft.

Wanamaker and Christopher Reeve.It is not an all there presentation that this film provides for with the unenviable task of allowing a AirMail plane to now have a passenger in Rosanna Arquette.It is interesting to note that Arquette is being given this ride because her father and his bank underwrote the very fortunes of this Airmail airline and felt it was a rather safe bet.The accident this time is even more hard to see how anyone would of survived but they both survive.The antics of this seventeen year old in actuality are a bit much to take.She causes almost singlehandedly both of there

excitement to contact the planeArquette takes a nasty fall and seriously injures herself.Reeverigs something up whereby you carry supplies on but instead Arquette is brought in tow and they continue to move however slowly.They arrive at something of a clearing when Reeve notices that there are telephone lines and rushes to locate first the telephone pole and then some perhaps indications of life.He is on his way back to where Arquette is however he does not know that Arquette shot at a Wolf and that the wolf has circled the area and comes back around and attacks Reeve.This time he has no gun and in the best tradition of Annie OakelyArquette shoots the wolf dead at 50 yards.To make a long story short they get rescued by the guy who did not do such a good fixit on the oil line and Arquette gets to kiss Christopher Reeve.The purport of this unbelievable film is that we have a very spoiled youth who in there own right have caused a very near disaster.When that youngster crashed and lost his life at the beginning of the filmhe would not of crashed had he been given a virtual right of waythat is no more for now unless you say so.He crashed because he wanted his way.Rosanna Arquette though may appear to be a little different but no alas the difference is she was after bigger game though she is just as spoiled as any rebellious teenager.The attempt to place heroic attributes around this characterization is pitiful and nothing but a lie.The kind of lies that youngsters are influenced by as they grow up in this world.It is not a believable film and even more so it is meant to damage credibility.This is a poor excuse for entertainment.These ridiculous films are really a virtual perversion and there is probably no greater an injustice than to provide any

It starts with the kidnapping of a leading lawyer. The kidnapper claims her to take the case of a murder to release her daughter. The story revolves on what she does to fight the murder case. The lead actress in the movie plays the role of the lawyer. She is so pretty I would love to see her in many movies. But to play a major role in a thriller she just screwed it up. If she was like the loverwife of the protagonist then she would have been perfect. However for this movie you need a strong character who has brains and bravery. For the whole movie she acts like a housewife that is sentimental and more concerned about the kidnapped daughter. Again such roles will fit with a concerned mother in a movie but to be the lead role that too of a lawyer she should have done better. At times she looks dumbfounded if not completely lost. To be precise she is like a deer in a headlight. I wish the director chose someone better to play her role. Other than that the sidekick to help her is good. He presents the perfect guy in the movies. The story has a mystery and I would recommend to people who love thrillers. But again if you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes or one who expects a cold detective this movie will not satisfy your tastes. Here and there there is useless emotion and sentiments. They are like speed breakers to thriller movies. Overall it is fine.".

The director that made this movie probably watched a lot of these thriller movie and mixed a lot of them together but it's just not effective. Midnight FM did a better job with it's execution with the mother looking for her kidnapped daughter scenarios although this came first. It's kinda obvious the director took ideas from other thrillers although that is my assuption and investigation TV shows which is fine but it's just not well blended. And comes together pretty darn lame and generic than cool and thrilling. The acting is just over the top for some characters and not believable including the direction. Yeah this is a movie but for a movie like this if it went in a more realistic direction it would have been a upgrade. This movie just felt really dragged out with constant uninteresting scenarios that could have been shortened down. The twist at the end was alright though actually pretty good. And I did like is how it shows how some lawyers mentality can be driven by victory over if that person they are defending is guilty or not or visa versa. The thing is the story seems to be all over the place but not for good reason. This isn't awful but there are better thrillers worth watching.5.810".

The director that made this movie probably watched a lot of these thriller movie and mixed a lot of them together but it's just not effective. Midnight FM did a better job with it's execution with the mother looking for her kidnapped daughter scenarios although this came first. It's kinda obvious the director took ideas from other thrillers although that is my assuption and investigation TV shows which is fine but it's just not well blended. And comes together pretty darn lame and generic than cool and thrilling. The acting is just over the top for some characters and not believable including the direction. Yeah this is a movie but for a movie like this if it went in a more realistic direction it would have been a upgrade. This movie just felt really dragged out with constant uninteresting scenarios that could have been shortened down. The twist at the end was alright though actually pretty good. And I did like is how it shows how some lawyers mentality can be driven by victory over if that person they are defending is guilty or not or visa versa. The thing is the story seems to be all over the place but not for good reason. This isn't awful but there are better thrillers worth watching.5.810";

	schema:reviewBody "I had very high expectations of Seven Days because I'm a big fan of lead actress Kim Yun Jin and because it got great reviews from critics who called it 'a Korean film version of CSI'. I left the movie theater disappointed because while this movie is OKAY it doesn't deserve the hype that the media is giving it. Just to give this movie a little bit of background it was originally titled 'Thursday's Child' starring Kim Sun Ah who's best known in the hit drama 'My Name is Kim Sam Sun'. Production on the movie was halted after the director was fired by the production company over creative differences. After waiting a couple of weeks Kim Sun Ah left the project because she didn't want to keep waiting. Already 2.8million dollars a big sum by Korean movie standards were spent on the movie and luckily renowned actress Kim Yun Jin agreed to do the movie if they filmed it in a short period of time so they hired a new director fixed the script to fit Kim's age and changed the title to 'Seven Days'.The movie focuses around Yoo Ji YunKim Yun Jin a very able lawyer with a 99percent success rate. Because of her busy career Ji Yun has little time to spend with her 8 year old daughter. When her daughter's school has their annual sports meeting Ji Yun comes to spend time with her daughter. But while Ji Yun participates in a 100 meter relay race her daughter suddenly disappears. The next day a phone call arrives. The mysterious caller says that she must free Jung Chul Jin a convicted murderer accused of murder. The final trial is in seven days and if Ji Yun doesn't free Jung she'll never see her daughter again.The concept itself is interesting. I can see why Hollywood bought the remake rights for one million dollarsa large sum by Korean movie industry standards but it's like a stale cake. On the outside it looks like a normal cake and is delicious. But after you eat it you have a terrible stomach ache. I give this movie 6 stars because it's very fresh in our movie industry but the story itself is too how can I say it anyways it could've had more depth.I guessed who the kidnapper was as soon as his or her face appeared onscreen. It turns out to be the mother of the woman that was murdered by Jung Chul Jin.".

	schema:reviewBody "The main if not the only to be honest reason I watched this film is that it stars the beautiful expressive athletic Korean actress Yunjin Kim who has of course become an international star thanks to her regular role as Sun in the TV series Lost. She does not disappoint  she gives a terrific performance here. The story a mix of kidnapping thriller whodunit and courtroom drama is VERY complex loaded with red herrings and engaging for the most part until a final twist that's a bit farfetched. Let's just say that you probably WON'T guess the identity of the kidnapper until the end but only because his  her motivations and the lengths that he  she goes to for the sake of his  her plan are a bit hard to swallow. But the main problem with Seven Days is the toooften gimmicky frantic direction. While it has its inventive moments Kim watching her kidnapped child it usually just makes scenes hard to watch. At 130 minutes the film is too long but the cast and most of the story are strong enough to earn it a mild recommendation. 12 out of 4.".

I think Ted Danson possibly gives his best performance ever as Washington Bellamy an enrapturedwithknowledge elementary school teacher who also collects beautifully oddball classic cars. The story line described above about trying to match the distance the Apollo crew travels by simultaneously driving over a large part of the country to the Spires of the Moon National Park is already a remarkably charming idea. This will be his one perfect act as he brings his very cute young boy with him leaving behind an quirky paranoid wife who is always afraid to leave the house. Mary Steenburgen plays this part with superb humor as she sets off after her husband and son. Of course interesting adventures and troubles occur during the journeys but it's Washington's never failing enthusiasm for life and its wonders that really make the film's ideas all work. I've watched this film a number of times and will watch it again into old age and when I'm no longer able to enjoy it I'll be ready to die.".

Suddenly it dawned on me that just like the fictitious National Park which has no basis in fact other goofs were deliberately put there to give the film a surreal tongueincheek quality. In short this is pure fantasy where anything goes.And trust me the last 20 minutes requires some heavy suspension of disbelief the same way a '49 Pontiac Eight would require a whole new suspension if you put a 455 engine in there like they did! The last 20 minutes featured things that were so absolutely wrong it felt like a ZuckerAbrahamsZucker movie Airplane! and I believe in its own subtle way that was the intent of the filmmakers. So just bear in mind things are supposed to get bizarre and dreamy.Now on to the movie as a whole...The story is refreshingly original. A wacky schoolteacher father Ted Danson decides to temporarily abscond with his sheltered son Ryan Todd in an impulsive effort to achieve one perfect act much to the chagrin of the agoraphobic mother Mary Steenburgen Dansons wife who hasn't left the house in 7 years. What follows is a cute road movie full of interesting characters and a few preposterous action scenes but now remember what I told you about suspension of disbelief while past family mysteries slowly unravel themselves. Everything leads lead us to an outrageous conclusion that will either leave you sighing with delight or hurling apple pie at the TV screen.This film is a oneofakind. At first it felt like a sappy E.T. type flick but it soon morphs into something more along the lines of Edward Scissorhands only without the satire  quirkiness then slips into something like the Dukes of Hazzard TV series before bringing us to something reminiscent of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.This is a very polished production with some memorable moments. The acting sometimes seems over the top but that's the point Danson  Steenburgen portraying polar extremes of lunacy. I didn't care for the musical soundtrack in the first half which seemed to upstage dialogue but in the latter half the film featured wellplaced nostalgic hits such as Crimson  Clover Let's Get Together smile on your brother and Cheek to Cheek. The director Peter Medak known for his prolific work on 70s80s TV did a nice job with some stylish visuals watch for the car carrier under the stars and tell me how the heck he pulled that off!.If you're prepared for a wild ride especially if you are able to experience the movie as if it were a dream you'll enjoy yourself. I must confess cynical old curmudgeon that I am I hated this movie through most of it. But I'm ready to watch it again through rose colored glasses and have fun the 2nd time around. Here's hoping you can skip the hatred part.".

Bellamy's goal is to reach the Spires of the Moon National Park at the same exact time that the Apollo XI astronauts land on the moon. Meanwhile Bellamy's timid agoraphobic wife Katherine beautifully played with touching vulnerability by Mary Steenburgen works up the courage to leave the house and follow after them.Director Peter Medak working from an offbeat yet thoughtful script by Finn Taylor and Jeffrey Brown offers an affectionate evocation of the late 1960's period setting ably crafts and sustains a pleasant warm tone makes the most out of the picturesque locations and further enhances things with amusing moments of gentle wacky humor. A slew of sharp cameos from a topdrawer cast gives this picture an extra appealing lift Cathy Moriarty as predatory barfly Lorraine Eric Schweig as friendly pacifist Native American Ernest Ironplume Max Gail as Bellamy's supportive farmer brother Jerome J.C. Quinn as an irascible bartender John Schuck as a bumbling state trooper and Don Swayze as a hostile redneck. The bright and attractive cinematography by Thomas Kloss provides a pleasing sparkling look. Randy Edelman's lush and lively score hits the sweeping spot. A nice little film.".

Bellamy's goal is to reach the Spires of the Moon National Park at the same exact time that the Apollo XI astronauts land on the moon. Meanwhile Bellamy's timid agoraphobic wife Katherine beautifully played with touching vulnerability by Mary Steenburgen works up the courage to leave the house and follow after them.Director Peter Medak working from an offbeat yet thoughtful script by Finn Taylor and Jeffrey Brown offers an affectionate evocation of the late 1960's period setting ably crafts and sustains a pleasant warm tone makes the most out of the picturesque locations and further enhances things with amusing moments of gentle wacky humor. A slew of sharp cameos from a topdrawer cast gives this picture an extra appealing lift Cathy Moriarty as predatory barfly Lorraine Eric Schweig as friendly pacifist Native American Ernest Ironplume Max Gail as Bellamy's supportive farmer brother Jerome J.C. Quinn as an irascible bartender John Schuck as a bumbling state trooper and Don Swayze as a hostile redneck. The bright and attractive cinematography by Thomas Kloss provides a pleasing sparkling look. Randy Edelman's lush and lively score hits the sweeping spot. A nice little film.";

Ted Danson Mary Steenburgen and Ryan Todd perform as if the roles were written for them and they carry the film with gusto and subtlety. It is such a joy to watch and I've watched it several times that I can't help but wonder why others can't get it but must pick at points that are simply irrelevant. Do you question whether Superman can actually fly or where is the exact location of the Shire? Pontiac Moon is a movie for heaven's sake and it's hugely enjoyable moving and entertaining. It encourages you to step out of your box and go out into the world because life is meant to be an adventure of the mind and body. This is not for people who wish to live average and mediocre lives of quiet desperation. I'll watch it again and again.Thank you Ted Danson.".

The story is about LOVE. a must seefamily movie. i think it is as good as the Christmas Story showing that one can have a fairly good childhood even with crazy parents. I love characters in it the geeky father and agoraphobic mother the kid who is about to start to suspect that his parents are not as good as others'. I like the plot of the film that is about a journey to reach the Craters of the Moon National Park in Idaho and drive an exact amount of miles to scale the real distance Apollo had to make. the father and son have to go quite a distance from California through Montana to make the miles match. The story gets more interesting as the mother has to overcome her fears to join them ultimately saving her family and marriage. While the story presented as a memoir of the child the overt part of the plot is quite simplistic. Yet what actually happens on unspoken level is extremely dramatic and revolutionary even for just one family. For me it was the key to my enjoyment of the whole film. The simplicity of a road movie reflects just the quality of the childhood memory deliberately put there to give the film a tone yet symbolic meaning of it has so many layers. In short this could be just a dream or fantasy where anything goes and open for the endless interpretations. Especially towards the end of the film things are supposed to get really dreamy and even bizarre.".

Besides the '49 Pontiac there was an Amphicar driven by Mary Steenburgen as well as some neat oldies from the '40s sitting outside the Bellamy's home which Washington kept as collector cars.Ultimately it was fun to watch the Bellamy family together again being saved from a police manhunt as they drove the Amphicar across a lake to Canada.Two parts of the movie were ridiculous one was Andy Bellamy in his own father's science class and putting a 455 V8 into the old Chief would have required major body modifications as well as a new transmission impossible to do in a single night.Inspiring was watching both the astronauts and the Bellamys preparing for their voyages at the same time the liftoff and that shift of the old HydraMatic Drive into DR was a lot of fun to watch.".

Aficonadodelosmovies from Idaho states...why they had to drive through Montana to get to Idaho from California it is completely out of the way This is explained by Bellamy to his son before they leave home. Bellamy demonstrates this to his son using a map. They had to follow an exact round about route. Bellamy and his son were forced to take an out of the way long way around so the Pontiac's odometer would read exactly the same mileage as the distance from the earth to the moon when they arrived at the fictional Spires of the moon. Bellamy very carefully and intentionally plotted their route the long way around so that when they arrived at Spires of the Moon the odometer would read the same miles as the distance from the earth to the moon. If they had gone by the direct route the Pontiac's mileage would have been nowhere near the miles they needed to match the distance from the earth to the moon. The movie made it very clear that this out of the way route was very intentional and necessary.".

Aficonadodelosmovies from Idaho states...why they had to drive through Montana to get to Idaho from California it is completely out of the way This is explained by Bellamy to his son before they leave home. Bellamy demonstrates this to his son using a map. They had to follow an exact round about route. Bellamy and his son were forced to take an out of the way long way around so the Pontiac's odometer would read exactly the same mileage as the distance from the earth to the moon when they arrived at the fictional Spires of the moon. Bellamy very carefully and intentionally plotted their route the long way around so that when they arrived at Spires of the Moon the odometer would read the same miles as the distance from the earth to the moon. If they had gone by the direct route the Pontiac's mileage would have been nowhere near the miles they needed to match the distance from the earth to the moon. The movie made it very clear that this out of the way route was very intentional and necessary.";

	schema:reviewBody "As pared down stylish and deceptively simple as the stark glass and concrete block inhabited by two of its main characters La Mujer de Mi Hermano My Brother's Wife is an adultery drama that skips the big life lessons in favor of observing the mysteries of human interdependency and social behavior.Peruvian director Ricardo de Montreuil has transposed the characters created by his compatriot novelist Jaime Bayly from Lima to Mexico City and has cast Mexican stars in three of the film's four principal roles. The idea behind the relocation was to broaden the film's global appeal as Mexican films tend to be well received across Latin America and within the United States. Accents and local slang are duly adjusted but the shift feels academic. La Mujer de Mi Hermano blooms inside only the most insular intimate spaces its characters untouched by the world around them. If anything it's a reminder that class  especially the upper echelons  is a country unto itself that doesn't recognize geographical borders.Disturbingly beautiful and melancholic Zo Barbara Mori lives with her imageobsessed husband Ignacio Christian Meier in an ultramodern house  half display case half hothouse  on the outskirts of the city. Ignacio is wealthy and doting but distant and their marriage is affectionate but passionless. Ignacio's sterility and Zo's refusal to consider adoption compound the feeling that the marriage has cruised into a culdesac.Zo's complaints which she shares with her gay friend Boris Bruno Bichir are legitimate but it's Ignacio who elicits sympathy at first. Genuinely afraid of losing Zo he exudes a tightly wound reinedin helplessness that's painful to watch. The feeling is cemented when Zo starts hanging around with Ignacio's estranged younger brother Gonzalo Manolo Cardona a painter who badmouths Ignacio at every opportunity but gladly takes his money each month. When Zo drops by his gallery unexpectedly Gonzalo sells her a painting from his show. The selling rather than giving becomes another point of contention between Gonzalo and Ignacio but for Zo it's a chance to get back at her husband.The principal pleasures of the film lie in the subtle shifts in character that prompt shifts in allegiance so I won't spoil them. The main thing is that La Mujer de Mi Hermano lets its characters' behaviors speak for themselves which naturally lead the audience into snap judgments that evolve into something more fluid and forgiving.Tall and broad Meier has a rigid hulking quality that serves him well as the highstrung businessman scared stiff of losing his wife. For a guy built like a pylon he has a remarkable way of making himself small by tucking himself into a neat package.Mori a memorable presence plays an instantly recognizable type nonetheless rarely seen on screen. Zo's uncommon beauty masks her neediness insecurity and loneliness. Mexican star Anglica Aragn plays Cristina the mother of Ignacio and Gonzalo a woman who sees strictly what she wants to see and nothing more.A final twist  a bit of a corker  threatens to push what has otherwise been a coolheaded emotional experience into the realm of melodrama. Despite this false note La Mujer de Mi Hermano keeps a cool eye trained on its characters as they struggle to make their lives conform to some strict phantom ideal.For a movie about an interfamily dalliance it's far more pragmatic than you might expect and far more humane. Ultimately La Mujer de Mi Hermano offers the uncommon in movieland perspective that it may be the ideal that oppresses life not the other way around.".

	schema:reviewBody "A LOT OF SPOILERS HERE SO BEWARE There has been considerable fuss over this movie and I'm not sure why. Rather than being 'shocking' as some have called it I found it pretty predictable primarily because the characters are clichs that have been familiar figures in movies over the past 10 or 15 years.'Mujer etc.' is a Peruvian film that is really a stylish soap opera. We have the conflicted husband Ignacio Christiane Meier who can't conceive the unhappy confused and childless wife Zoe Barbara Mori and the husband's brother a scruffy evercool always foulmouthed Gonzalo Manolo Cardona who also just happens to be a talented artist why are these people never accountants or claims adjusters?. Gonzalo wants to sexually possess the wife rather than love her more out of revenge and hatred for his brother.And then to round up the usual clichd suspects we have the nonthreatening flaming gay guy Boris Bruno Bichir who offers secret breathless advice to Zoe while confessing around deeply effeminate giggles that he finds her husband 'very hot'. Zoe for reasons that escape me regularly and inexplicably seeks his counsel. This is some counsel Boris says Zoe's husband must be gay because if he wasn't he would want to have sex with her every day this is after 10 years of marriage. With advice like that I'd be looking for another nonthreatening flaming gay guy.It could be my imagination but contemporary movies are littered with situations like this the 'thirdparty' omniscient gay man who is sought out for advice by confused heterosexual women or men.Director Ricardo de Montreuil tries to explain everything toward the end and it becomes a pretty awkward 'wrapping up' ceremony. The husband confesses he 'likes men' i.e. he's always been gay. The wife who has slept with this guy for 10 whole years appears to be shocked by his confession. Credibility anyone? The nonthreatening gay guy offers to adopt the wife's baby as his own and how many times have we seen this scenario?. The wife is content with a child donated by sperm from the rotten brother who has exacted his revenge on his brother and wants nothing more to do with the wife. The husband carries on living a gay lifestyle while he continues to live and sleep with his wife in an agreement that includes a 'fully loving' relationship. Egads. As if.This director wants us to suspend a whole lot of disbelief in this film and it just doesn't work at least for me.".

Zoe for reasons that escape me regularly and inexplicably seeks his counsel. This is some counsel Boris says Zoe's husband must be gay because if he wasn't he would want to have sex with her every day this is after 10 years of marriage. With advice like that I'd be looking for another nonthreatening flaming gay guy.It could be my imagination but contemporary movies are littered with situations like this the 'thirdparty' omniscient gay man who is sought out for advice by confused heterosexual women or men.Director Ricardo de Montreuil tries to explain everything toward the end and it becomes a pretty awkward 'wrapping up' ceremony. The husband confesses he 'likes men' i.e. he's always been gay. The wife who has slept with this guy for 10 whole years appears to be shocked by his confession. Credibility anyone? The nonthreatening gay guy offers to adopt the wife's baby as his own and how many times have we seen this scenario?. The wife is content with a child donated by sperm from the rotten brother who has exacted his revenge on his brother and wants nothing more to do with the wife. The husband carries on living a gay lifestyle while he continues to live and sleep with his wife in an agreement that includes a 'fully loving' relationship. Egads. As if.This director wants us to suspend a whole lot of disbelief in this film and it just doesn't work at least for me.";

The ending is a powerful one and all three actors come in true sync with their respective characters. This is the second film Meier has done based on a Jaime Bayly character and here he hits a bang! All three main characters are subtle yet very effective with their portrayals..simply amazing chic and sexy all throughout.I had a slight problem with the fact that sex was a little bit overdone...It somehow felt that some of the sex talk scenes took away from the actual story and felt more like a filler than to have any substantial purpose. This was one of the main reasons I would rate this movie a 7.5 out of 10...It was a great movie that had a great pacing for the surprise finale and I was a bit baffled about one of the character's actions after he discovers something very significant to the story which I will not give away. Manolo Cardona was also great and the imperfections of his character came alive through the screen.I did not see this movie with subtitles so I am not sure what nonSpanish speaking folks read but I do have to say that it is understandable why many American critics will slander this film. Is because they don't understand that Hispanic films don't deal with some of the American topics on film in a daily basis. Americans and Europeans make tons of films about rape incest murder and every possible sick thing imaginable which is why it might seem like a joke that something like La Mujer De Mi Hermano will cause marvel to the Hispanic audience. Spanishspeaking films seldomly deal with these topics and do not have such a big history with sleek smart  taboo films so they should definitely take that into consideration when rating the film.Overall I felt as I needed more...More thoughtprovoking dialogue but it did justice to the Jaime Bayly novels which rather speak for themselves rather than providing revolutionary sayings.".

Firsttime feature director Ricardo de Montreuil has a firm grasp on his story and he is not afraid to let Mori who is breathtakingly gorgeous dominate the action and be the central focus.

The cinematography is lush and evocative in the competent hands of Andrs Snchez and the tension of the story is well underscored by the music of Angelo Milli.

	schema:reviewBody "SAw the trailer for this film on Apple Trailers and was intrigued as it hinted at being an emotionally charged film in the 'Closer' category of hard hitting relationship dramas but upon seeing it was let down by what turned out to be a quite commercial venture with some very unlikely developments.First of all the premise is potentially rife for intrigue but the script dictates that the brothers hate each other and that Gonzalo the younger one would like nothing more than punish his brother. Then we find that Zoe and Ignacio have a very stale unadventurous relationship. Then we find that Gonzalo is a painter and lives a very liberated life and that Ignacio lives in a grey concrete house as square as his spectacles. With this premise it becomes too obvious and not difficult enough for the affair between wife and husband's brother to happen.The first meetings between Zoe and Gonzalo are simple exposition scenes where all they talk about is how much they really would like to have sex and then they do. There is no danger apart from the husband being his brother. What makes for a truly intriguing scenario is when the danger is emotional  i.e. if the brothers were great friends and got along really well but the irresistible nature of the eldest brother's wife makes it impossible for the younger brother to resist  and if the marriage is a happy one. That would be a great premise and make the emotional danger far greater. Have a look at Liv Ullman's 'Faithless' for a film full of emotional danger and high stakes.Surely the point of casting a woman as indescribably beautiful and sexy as Barbara Mori is to make Zoe irresistible to anyone and for the passion of a union with this dream girl to reach unprecedented heights. Instead we are taken through some rather dispassionate scenes between Gonzalo and Zoe that we are told are great through conversations between Zoe and surprise surprise never seen this before her gay friend Boris.Film is a visual medium and there was little visual evidence of this affair being at all more than some sex. It is in this kind of context where I think more explicit sexual content is entirely necessary in order to give the viewer the feeling of being part of an adult world where adults do adult things  like have illicit passionate sex. Because sex is central to theme there needs to be more of it. Well not more but more realistic more intense. Take 'Unfaithful' with Diane Lane and Richard Gere. The scenes between Diane Lane and her lover are very steamy and sensual and sexy some even violent  which makes the illicit nature of their affair real and dangerous. Or look at 'Closer' where we are not given the sex visually but the full explicit sexual escapades are exposed through the argument between Owen and Roberts which is equally hard hitting through its graphic language. The most explicit scene in this film was between Gonzalo and his girlfriend LauraGaby Espino who I guess has a more relaxed nudity clause than Mori but which here makes it seem like that is more passionate than the central affair.Aside from the lack of sexual power there were plot points and character behaviours that felt crow barred. The only back story we get is that Zoe and Ignacio want a child and can't and that Ignacio apparently molested his brother when they were young. These two things are meant to give the reasoning behind why Zoe allows herself to have an affair and why Gonzalo so happily betrays his brother. Then we find that Ignacio is homosexual  which is to explain his lack of passion for the gorgeous Zoe. Fine these are all valid ideas but how they develop is very trite and unlikely. The point at which Gonzalo talks about his brother molesting him comes from nowhere and quickly vanishes. There is no indication before  apart from Gonzalo being a bit angry at his brother  and there are no consequences after  Zoe never finds out and we don't know if it is true  nothing. The fact that Ignacio is homosexual is hinted at and when admitted is followed by a bizarre solution he says that he will stay with Zoe forever and be a father but that he will have to have men sometimes. She is his life long love but he likes men  meaning he wants to be with her asexually which she then says is fine and voil everything is rosy. They just deal with it!? Gonzalo meanwhile suddenly cares nothing for Zoe as if his boyhood fantasy of her is gone through the revelation she is pregnant with his child. There is also a very odd unresolved scene where the gay friend Boris says he is happy to father the child  which Zoe thinks sounds like a wonderful idea. All these scenes are very much uncharacteristic of normal human behaviour and feel like the scriptwriter having run out of ways of tying things up and resorting to quick fixes.Having said all that it somehow manages to be watchable and fairly entertaining film. Probably down to it being rather nicely filmed and the acting being quite strong. For any red blooded male just watching Mori is a delight and she is not bad as an actress either. I suppose I think it could have been so much more much stronger with a darker more intense edge which is what I have gotten used to seeing from Latin and South American films. Instead I was given a rather simple commercially structured film with some nice scenes that carried little weight.".

Storywise it would have been better off set anywhere between the Fifties because technically it's akin to the much better FAR FROM HEAVEN in melodrama or even when this type of movies came into vogue during the period going from the late Seventies into the early Nineties. How and why it's situated in the present and even more so that its story got through the datedness that bogs it down is a mystery but then again Latin America is still in a mire of its own ultraconservative values  men are supposed to be macho women who take charge of their own life are seen as little more than zorras in heat and everything happens in a very hushhush way. So for a Latin American public the premise of LA MUJER DE MI HERMANO may work perfectly on the other hand it falls into an ugly Splat! of epic proportions on this side of the Rio Grande.Much of it has nothing to do with its denouement which to a degree may even then be somewhat forgivable. Its failing and Achilles heel is based squarely in the trite language  both on a visual and written level  that tries to tell an intelligent story but has nothing to hold on to. For example we're told that Ignacio and Zoe have been married for ten years and that's okay. What is not and where the story's implausibilities begin to show is that in those ten years they've fallen into a predictability where Ignacio can only have sex on Saturdays and prefers business traveling than being with Zoe. Ten years is a long long time for Zoe not to notice the 500 pound elephant sitting placidly in her sleek minimalistic and ubercontemporary living room. Maybe it's those twenty grapes she has a penchant for. Then again Dorothy Parker wrote a story called Too Bad where a married couple of seven years suddenly separated. No one knew why but once we went inside the marriage we saw that these two had absolutely nothing in common not even enough for small talk. We never find out their mechanics but it's still a pretty funny story.This however is a story that takes itself seriously. Adding to the fact that Ignacio and Zoe have strange marital arrangements is the presence of Ignacio's studly brother Gonzalo. Gonzalo and Ignacio are estranged as presented in exclamation points early on at a family lunch. Zoe dogooder that she is contacts Gonzalo and tries to make amends. He sells her a painting and Ignacio hits the ceiling. Fifteen minutes are spent mulling and arguing over this painting as if it had some symbolic meaning. No sooner than this happens that Zoe is confiding deep secrets to Gonzalo as if she'd known him all her life and a phone conversation implausibly makes its way to Ignacio's ears but all he can do is throw the darned painting into the pool and seethe. More unremarkable events take place Zoe also confides in who we're led to believe is her best friend Boris a stereotypical nellie. Conversations between Zoe and Boris are built to make us understand more will come out of their friendship but that doesn't happen. The same can be said when Zoe makes Gonzalo prove to her he hasn't had sex with other women or when in a repeat scene she makes Ignacio promise her he hasn't had sex with men. It's all tease and fake promise.So with all this teasing going on it's not a surprise as to why LA MUJER DE MI HERMANO looks good but is quite bad. It begins with the misnomer of its title which would have Gonzalo the main narrator of the story and ends by its sheer quaintness that never decides where it wants to take its characters and leaves them muddled in its telenovela roots. At least for a debut film from Ricardo de Montreuil it's not a flatout failure. It sells glossy images attractive leads that would be at home in daytime soap the presence of a veteran actress Angelica Aragon and that's all there is to it.".

It's something that should be tried more often. We should organize distribution  production companies in LatinAmerica to integrate the whole region and give us more opportunities to see Latin American films because there's such an overload of American films that we in Brazil know much more about Hollywood stars than about our LatinAmerican neighbours. This said let's go to the film.The film is about a triangle love story but it is in some ways unusual there's no moral preaching and no conventional happy ending. The characters belong to the privileged class and live in a conservative background where the Catholic Church is still a power to reckon with but the modern world is their real world. They may sometimes go to mass and confession but when conflicts between the two worlds arise their own wishes prevail in spite of conservative dogmas and the Church and their icons go to the background.There was a reviewer that said that the sex scenes were a fillup and were not necessary at all. I disagree with him. Sex is essential to show the reason why Zoe gorgeous Barbara Mori in spite of her conservative upbringing engages in an affair with her brotherinlaw. And the sex scenes are really sensual showing a woman discovering herself through sexual pleasure. Can someone tell me of any American actress able to do the same in such a sensual way? The acting of the whole cast is excellent the film has such a good story that manages to keep our interest till the end. I'm not telling you that La Mujer de mi Hermano is a masterpiece but certainly it's a very good film.Other Latin American films I recommend are Pantaleon Y las Visitadoras Maria Full of Grace Nina Santa El mismo amor La misma lluvia Y Tu Mama Tambien Machuca and so many others!".

But because of that I was even more prone to watch for mistakes or imperfections in the acting than I normally do when watching a movie. The first thing that must be said about this film is that the cinematography is excellent!! The attention to detail and framing that was put into every shot is manifest. Even just the opening sequence with the leaves floating in the pool was shot with a talent that is evident throughout the movie. The soundtrack is fine and subtle blending well with the scenes and setting the appropriate mood. The acting was top rate  across the board  from the primary actors to the supporting cast down to the extras. Way to go cousin you did fantastic. The director definitely knew his story well and seamlessly planned out the path on which he would develop it. The situations and circumstances portrayed are perfectly believable. You truly find yourself engaged in the lives of these people. As the madness guilt and predicaments gather up you can't help but feel pity for each character's weakness and just hope that in them lies some dormant strength they can muster to correct and recover their lives. This is a good drama film. And if you are in the mood for the steamy quandaries that people can get themselves into you will enjoy watching this movie. By the way my cousin is Manolo Cardona just in case you were curious.".

It could be said that all they do is talk philosophize and soulsearch in this film. So if what they talk about is interesting and moves you then the movie works. With subject matter such as religion friendship finding a meaning in life and even the art of salesmanship the characters definitely have a lot to say. And they're pretty funny even if the film is too tragic to be called a comedy. Bottom line is I'll long remember Danny DeVito's touching understated performance.He and Kevin Spacey Phil and Larry respectively play experienced industrial lubricant salesman who've been sent to a convention in Wichita. Accompanying the two longtime friends and colleagues is a young coworker Bob Peter Facinelli. They're hosting a small party in their hospitality suite for the elusive Dick Fuller. This is a client who could conceivably make or break their careers but might not even show up to talk biz. Fuller represents the title character although you could also say the kahuna is God. The final third of the picture delves deeply into spiritual belief and the search for the man above. Facinelli is devout Spacey is not DeVito rides in the middle lane and tries to keep the peace.Whether or not they actually make the big deal plays second fiddle to the giveandtake relationship of the 3 very different men. Spacey is as witty and smart as usual but DeVito is the soul of 'The Big Kahuna'. He's been good before but he's generally a comic actor. Here he's the straight man. The writer and director Roger Rueff and John Swanbeck who've never made another film know how to give Spacey his big scenes and they REALLY know how to let DeVito play everything in expressions and tone. The filmmakers aren't breaking new turf but they let their excellent actors act. Even if this is just another verse in the 'Death Of A Salesman' song DeVito's got the goods on Willy Loman.".

	schema:headline " A refreshingly intelligent film";
	schema:reviewBody "This refreshingly intelligent film delivers raw intellectual power by retaining the look and feel of the play from which it was adapted.  The use of a single set and just three actors throws the emphasis entirely upon the indepth character studies the incisive dialogue and the actors' outstanding performances.  It draws us into the lives of three seemingly ordinary guys at a convention whose interaction broaches questions that are nothing short of an examination of the meaning of life.  The dialogue unabashedly strips the characters naked to show the ironies and hypocrisies inherent in their strategies for establishing meaning in the machinations of mundane lives.  The laser sharp exchanges slash relentlessly at the souls of each leaving none of the characters intact by the end of the film.  And with each thrust they drive another introspective probe deep into the psyche of the viewer.The presentation reminded me a little of Glengarry Glen Ross' with its theatrical feel and deep reflective tone although this film was more confronting and less darkly despondent.  Roger Roeff's penetrating script approaches the meaninglessness of life from three unique perspectives.  We have Larry Kevin Spacey the seemingly superficial cynic who has far greater depth than he lets on and who uses his sardonic persona as a defense mechanism to hide his own fears.  Phil Danny DeVito is the pragmatic but jaded salesman who is great at putting things in perspective for everyone but himself.  Bob is the nave young Christian zealot whose antidote for the futility of life is a strong dose of Jesus.The juxtaposition of Larry the cynic and Bob the idealist makes for numerous thought provoking exchanges especially when we learn that Phil our mediator and voice of reason is drowning in his own soulsearching quest for meaning.  The story poses more questions than it does answers and sputters a bit at the end but overall it accomplishes its purpose of making the viewer ponder profundities easily ignored while in the pursuit of everyday priorities.The acting was brilliant.  Kevin Spacey gave what I thought was the best performance of his career.  This was so much more interesting and meaty a character than he played in American Beauty' that Spacey easily eclipsed even that outstanding performance.  Larry was such a dynamic and complex character that Spacey was able to open up the throttle and show us the full measure of his considerable talents.  Likewise Danny DeVito delivered a personal best in a serious dramatic role.  His portrayal of the mediator who was trying to keep the peace while he was disintegrating inside was subtle and powerful.  Peter Facinelli was also near perfect with an utterly believable and sincere performance as the pure hearted whelp whose heart was suffused with the Lord.I rated this film a 910 but it requires a certain type of viewer to enjoy it.  It is a very intellectual film which precludes it from having much mass appeal.  Action junkies will be bored to tears.  However for those who have a philosophical bent this film will be highly satisfying.".

Phil Danny DeVito is the pragmatic but jaded salesman who is great at putting things in perspective for everyone but himself.  Bob is the nave young Christian zealot whose antidote for the futility of life is a strong dose of Jesus.The juxtaposition of Larry the cynic and Bob the idealist makes for numerous thought provoking exchanges especially when we learn that Phil our mediator and voice of reason is drowning in his own soulsearching quest for meaning.  The story poses more questions than it does answers and sputters a bit at the end but overall it accomplishes its purpose of making the viewer ponder profundities easily ignored while in the pursuit of everyday priorities.The acting was brilliant.  Kevin Spacey gave what I thought was the best performance of his career.  This was so much more interesting and meaty a character than he played in American Beauty' that Spacey easily eclipsed even that outstanding performance.  Larry was such a dynamic and complex character that Spacey was able to open up the throttle and show us the full measure of his considerable talents.  Likewise Danny DeVito delivered a personal best in a serious dramatic role.  His portrayal of the mediator who was trying to keep the peace while he was disintegrating inside was subtle and powerful.  Peter Facinelli was also near perfect with an utterly believable and sincere performance as the pure hearted whelp whose heart was suffused with the Lord.I rated this film a 910 but it requires a certain type of viewer to enjoy it.  It is a very intellectual film which precludes it from having much mass appeal.  Action junkies will be bored to tears.  However for those who have a philosophical bent this film will be highly satisfying.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Big Kahuna proved to be one of the finest offerings that I was privy to at the Toronto International Film Festival this year. The expression saving the best for last applies strongly to this film. We were fortunate to have a QA after the film with Roger Rueff the screenwriter of this eloquently written piece John Swanbeck the director enjoying all that a first timer could hope for from his debut and the gifted actor Kevin Spacey who starred in and produced the film.This marvellous examination of three men of different age groups at a convention in Wichita also features the talents of Danny DeVito who apparently came to the production in the proverbial last minute. This film was shot in a very short sixteen days which comes as a surprise despite it's one central location as the dialogue is so strong. The best way to describe it is as almost poetic. The script was adapted from the play Hospitality Suite also written by Rueff who revealed in the QA that the story was based upon his own experiences at a sales convention long ago. But he assured us that his character of the young impressionable bible thumping Bob was not based on himself. Rueff also noted that with this being his first screenplay he had worried about the horror stories he heard where scripts are butchered and transformed into things the writer never intended in many Hollywood productions. But in this case he trusted the director and cast implicitly and was not disappointed in any way.Kevin Spacey shines in this sneak peak behind the scenes of a sales convention where the future of a company lies squarely on the shoulders of three men in the pursuit of a big client. The president of another company represents the biggest potential account they will ever have. They exchange stories accounts and personal philosophies and find how different they are from one another based on what they've been through.The interaction between the three actors is mesmerizing. They take the audience into what feels like a true life account documented verbatim. To say more would spoil the outcome for those who've not yet had a chance to enjoy this film. It is my strong recommendation that all of those who have not do so at their first available opportunity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though essentially little more than a stage bound version of the play Hospitality Suite' the film entitled The Big Kahuna' earns distinction for its sharply delineated characters and the finely wrought performances of its three main actors.  In fact the stage origins of the film are evident in the fact that the action rarely extends beyond a single set  a hotel suite in Wichita Kansas in which three salesman are gathered for a convention  and the fact that only four people are even assigned speaking parts and even the fourth is a mere walkon bellboy.  All the other people we see serve as a kind of silent backdrop before which the three principal players enact their complex personal drama.Kevin Spacey in a truly brilliant performance plays Larry a middleaged sardonic salesman who sees life strictly from the perspective of a hardcore cynic and who consequently runs roughshod over his two business associates with his acerbic wit and hardnosed bluntness.  In total contrast is Bob Peter Facinelli a 20something neophyte to the selling business a sincere wellintentioned but hopelessly nave bornagain Christian who has trouble separating his career as a salesman from his felt need to fulfill the Biblical edict to go out among men and spread the Good News. Caught between the two is Phil Danny DeVito a 52year old man who after years of devoting his life to the cause of selling has begun to seriously question the validity of his life's work and has therefore recently found himself contemplating such weighty matters as suicide the existence of God and the meaning of love and friendship.  Obviously such cleanly delineated characters could well have slid over into twodimensional stereotypes yet the author Roger Rueff in adapting his play to the screen has built into each of the three principal figures a dimension of multifaceted human complexity.  Larry for instance despite all of his facile cynicism shows a far deeper side to his character when in a quiet moment in which Phil pours his heart out to him he offers his buddy the hand of genuine compassion and friendship.  We discover that the oftenbitter tone Larry displays to the world is just a faade a coverup for the void that lies deep within his own troubled psyche.  Similarly Rueff avoids the common trap of reducing the devout Christian character to the customary level of a mindless buffoon.  Although we sense that Bob too uses his Christianity as a way of ordering his life  thereby avoiding the messy ugliness that a more freethinking life often requires  yet Rueff merely implies that Bob has some growing up to do not that his belief system must itself be jettisoned. And Phil caught between these two worldviews provides out of his own confused weakness the voice of reasoned sanity that helps Larry and Bob come to a final understanding and mutual appreciation of each other.  He sees Larry plainly for who he is yet Phil knows that this is the person who means more to him than anyone else in the world.  Similarly though he somewhat admires and respects Bob's sincere devotion to his Christian principles Phil knows that Bob has a long way to go before he becomes a true man of character.'The Big Kahuna' does not provide big laughs though the sardonic wit often strikes a deep chord in the audience.  The film may also seem claustrophobic to those who demand more movement from their movies.  The dialogue however is consistently sharp and incisive even though Phil's final speech borders a bit on the pedantic.  At this point Phil's function as the author's mouthpiece becomes a bit heavyhanded to say the least.  Nevertheless for those in search of a fine character study driven by strong performances and insightful observations about human nature The Big Kahuna' is definitely worth checking out.".

There's a lot of dialog  virtually the entire movie takes place in the suite with only a few very minor scenes outside it  and each word is absolutely dripping with meaning. There aren't any throwaway lines in this movie folks. Most movies contain generic lines that would fit in any similar movie. Not this one.

This is always a problem with movies based on plays. They come off restrained stagey and claustrophobic. But the lack of action actually gives the viewer the opportunity to watch two decidedly different acting styles. Spacey is bombastic punctuating each syllable with a sneer or a rant. DeVito on the other hand is more reserved and appears wizened as a result. Each actor turns in a stunning performance with Spacey basically reprising the role he played in Glengarry Glen Ross. The only one who seems out of place is Facinelli who is ineffective as Bob the marketing guy.The Big Kahuna is compelling as long as you don't mind talky comedydramas.".

If it doesn't define the true character it surely reflects on the core of how they see their art.

The director a first timer tries to work in interesting cinematic techniques but he doesn't do it enough and you end up feeling like you're watching a play.  But the play isn't even good as it was in other films with the same problem I'm thinking of Oleanna here. THe simple fact of the matter is that this story didn't need to be told didn't want to be told and is not told well.  The acting?  Danny DeVito's alright I suppose but he has that earnest nice guy look he has in most of his work these days.  Kevin Spacey sinks way below the heights he reached in American Beauty.  Spacey bitches and moans and proves once more that he can overact with the best of them.  The fact that Spacey also produced this film makes it even sadder  this was Spacey's idea of a good movie.  This movie has nothing to recommend it.  THe story is flat and uninteresting and builds to an intense conclusion that is full of emotion and energy but is completely undeserved by what came before it.  This is a total piece of garbage.

That's when the film on itself nearly capsizes.Basically the storyline unfolds like Waiting For Godot' the three salesman have set up a cocktail party for their meeting with this red herring of sorts and what ultimately comes down the pike is he shows but unknowingly to Larry and Phil has had a heart to heart with the young Bob.  Realizing they only have one shot when Bob casually describes a warm conversation leading to an invitation to an exclusive gathering late in the evening Larry and Phil persuade their cohort to ingratiate himself into the good graces of their clienttobe which results in an unlikely turn of events namely the subject of one's selfbeliefs i.e. what one considers important and in this case it is Bob's straightarrow image and his strong will in being a faithful Godfearing man who loves his wife and believes there's more to life than this account.Spacey and De Vito reunited from L.A. Confidential' make a nice comic team as they try to make sense of their lives particularly the latter's downward spiral since his pending divorce and sudden sense of getting out of the business leaving the former flummoxed and later to a fault selfdiscovery that it may have been too late.There are some comparisons to a Billy Wilder sense of responsiblities here and the stagy direction by theatrical trained Swanback the piece was performed onstage as well but that only enhances the nicely conveyed characters on screen.  Spacey has a lot of fun here particularly in having his character display some spontaneous feats of frustration to comic effect in one scene he practically has a hissy fit on a sofa and in another his apoplectic facial reactions are only harnessed by his sarcastic responses. Funny and enlightening a rare combination.  The same could be said of Kevin Spacey himself.".

It is alright to fail however failure must have a reason and now for Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito recrimination must serve a constructive purpose!! Being lambasted by mediocrity has become the insidious social hindrance which has aggregately demoralized both of them!! For these two their Horatio Alger spirits have been utterly vitiated!!! This is a very ideologically riveting concept that the film The Big Kahuna purveys!!The intense emotions in this movie are extremely realistic!! Kevin Spacey's performance is remarkable!!! The ideological premise of life having a cohesive plausibility has been totally obliterated in this film!!! For better or for worse reality has now become vicariously abusive!!! The resonating attitudes for the main characters in this movie ultimately emerged with all three men have a clearer understanding of one another. I found this movie to be identifiable and poignant!! Upper middle class hangups have effortlessly thwarted as well as devoured all three of these men!!! Failure to close a sale transcends the loss of commission it also serves as an indictment on an individual's charisma!! The outstanding portrayal of recognizable human inadequacies is the key component as to why I strongly recommend that every salesperson in this country sees this film!!".

Being lambasted by mediocrity has become the insidious social hindrance which has aggregately demoralized both of them!! For these two their Horatio Alger spirits have been utterly vitiated!!! This is a very ideologically riveting concept that the film The Big Kahuna purveys!!The intense emotions in this movie are extremely realistic!! Kevin Spacey's performance is remarkable!!! The ideological premise of life having a cohesive plausibility has been totally obliterated in this film!!! For better or for worse reality has now become vicariously abusive!!! The resonating attitudes for the main characters in this movie ultimately emerged with all three men have a clearer understanding of one another. I found this movie to be identifiable and poignant!! Upper middle class hangups have effortlessly thwarted as well as devoured all three of these men!!! Failure to close a sale transcends the loss of commission it also serves as an indictment on an individual's charisma!! The outstanding portrayal of recognizable human inadequacies is the key component as to why I strongly recommend that every salesperson in this country sees this film!!";

After a chanceless expedition to find something worthwhile 'Identity' and 'The Big Kahuna' were the only two movies we nominated. We flipped a coin and it was heads so we rented 'The Big Kahuna'. Alright Kevin Spacey Danny de Vito what could go wrong? During the first 15 minutes of the movie it felt it could turn out good although the constant blabbering of Spacey's character started to annoy. Three guys two marketing veterans De Vito and Spacey and a new guy in a hotel room planning a reception to get some big cheese business guy to use their lubricants. After 30 minutes nothing has changed. There's only conversation. We start to think this movie was made in one day and in one take. Every half ass bit of dialogue stayed in somehow. And all of a sudden after 45 minutes... NOTHING still nothing! Dear god! I guess  the screenwriter who also wrote the original play must have thought that if he'd just let the characters talk on and on and say quas intelligent and insightful things he would have a brilliant movie. Then there's the reception which the whole movie is about. Big cheese dude doesn't show up Spacey's character goes halfway nuts but not in a funny or cool way just annoying De Vito doesn't care he doesn't care about anything which IS interesting and the new guy doesn't know whether he cares. New guy spoke to big businessman didn't know it was him got a card and went to big businessman's party it all leads to nothing.Nearing the end there are some decent conversation between De Vito and the new guy and that's about it. Now a movie were nothing happens can be very interesting when there is great dialogue likeable characters great actors and some kind of coming of ageending but this movie offers none of those features. 98 percent of the movie takes place in the terribly boring hotel room which makes you want to sleep the overall pace of the film does so even more. I'm sorry if I've spoiled the whole movie for you but then again you could say I've saved you a couple of bucks which you can now invest in beer or food.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a poor henpecked loser who isn't allowed cable television I found myself in the rather alien position of being spoilt for choice over which movie to watch last Sunday night. British terrestrial television rarely throws up such a dilemma so I had to consider carefully which one to select. In the corner marked 'safe option' we had Mel Gibson's Ransom seen it dull can't really remember what happened but am assuming they eventually get the kid back second was Man on the Moon seen it vaguely remember being a bit disappointed and third was Wes Craven's Dracula 2000 never seen it presumably a straighttovideo job. Almost without hesitation I plumped for that.A maverick choice you might say  but there was method to my madness. On more than one occasion drunken and deluded girls have approached me in bars and accused me of looking like Jonny Lee Miller. They are wrong of course  those close to me have taken sadistic pleasure in assuring me I look more like a cross between Woody Harrelson and Kelsey Grammar  not particularly good for my sexsymbol status but useful if I ever wanted work as a stunt double on the set of Cheers.Anyway it turns out I chose wisely  Dracula 2000 is a hoot. More Schlock than horror as you might expect from the creator of the Scream franchise it has the kind of kitschy charm of Buffy the Vampire Slayer only with worse dialogue and a sillier plot. Those purists who prefer a more classic Peter CushingChristopher Lee tussle between good and evil are unlikely to stay beyond the first reel but there are rewards for those who stick it out.Miller plays Simon Shepherd the protg of the mysterious Matthew Van Helsing Christopher Plummer. A gang of thieves infiltrate Van Helsing's secret stash of old relics and unwittingly release Dracula from his silver coffin. Big mistake.

	onyx:emotionText "Being a poor henpecked loser who isn't allowed cable television I found myself in the rather alien position of being spoilt for choice over which movie to watch last Sunday night. British terrestrial television rarely throws up such a dilemma so I had to consider carefully which one to select. In the corner marked 'safe option' we had Mel Gibson's Ransom seen it dull can't really remember what happened but am assuming they eventually get the kid back second was Man on the Moon seen it vaguely remember being a bit disappointed and third was Wes Craven's Dracula 2000 never seen it presumably a straighttovideo job. Almost without hesitation I plumped for that.A maverick choice you might say  but there was method to my madness. On more than one occasion drunken and deluded girls have approached me in bars and accused me of looking like Jonny Lee Miller. They are wrong of course  those close to me have taken sadistic pleasure in assuring me I look more like a cross between Woody Harrelson and Kelsey Grammar  not particularly good for my sexsymbol status but useful if I ever wanted work as a stunt double on the set of Cheers.Anyway it turns out I chose wisely  Dracula 2000 is a hoot. More Schlock than horror as you might expect from the creator of the Scream franchise it has the kind of kitschy charm of Buffy the Vampire Slayer only with worse dialogue and a sillier plot. Those purists who prefer a more classic Peter CushingChristopher Lee tussle between good and evil are unlikely to stay beyond the first reel but there are rewards for those who stick it out.Miller plays Simon Shepherd the protg of the mysterious Matthew Van Helsing Christopher Plummer. A gang of thieves infiltrate Van Helsing's secret stash of old relics and unwittingly release Dracula from his silver coffin. Big mistake. The dark lord makes a beeline for New Orleans in search Van Helsing's daughter Mary. On his way he creates merry hell crafting a few undead henchwomen mostly blonde and enjoying unspeakable depravity in the middle of the Mardi Gras carnival.

It was a MOVIE!Dracula 2000 was a lot better than the old Hammer movies or in fact a lot better than a lot of other Vampire moves. If you could ever do an original story on Vampires this was close. I mean what is in a Vampire script. Spooky guygirl gets out of coffin kills people usually girls with great bodies another guygirl tries to kill them before they kill again. Oh and I forgot the part about the heroine is a reincarnation of the Vamps long lost love. See Blacula Fright Night Dracula 1992 etc etcDracula 2000 was more original. At least he had a real reason for wanting the Heroine his blood her blood and his origin was an interesting concept better than Coppola's which I still find confusing. This was never going to be An Interview with a Vampire but it was a hell of a lot better than Queen of the Damned. If you like Vampire movies this should be on your viewing list.".

	schema:reviewBody "in a campy sort of way. First watch the DVD deleted scenes extended scenes and audition featuring Gerard Butler. That will get you in the right mood! Then start the film. The first 30 minutes are a mess. After the opening scenes with Christopher Plummer as Van Helsing that lays the groundwork for the story they could have skipped all the scenes about the stealing of the coffin and just had Plummer tell Simon Johnny Lee Miller we been robbed!. But the young people and the robbery and taking the coffin by plane and it crashing  all could be handled by voiceover. This is just a mess and not one of the actors are interesting or have any charisma. Especially Solina Jennifer Esposito going into the vault dark and creepy and skulls and gad! you get the picture. We are in for a fright! Bah!!! So lame.Our first great shot of Dracula Butler is on the plane when he walks into the section of the plane and reaches out for Solina  and like any sane woman she goes right to him. The love bite is next. Um Hmmmm! In the meantime Mary Van Helsing Justine Waddell  child like and innocent is having dreamsnightmares seeing Dracula in her mirror. She is speechless and we are too. OMG! She keeps saying wake up  you're dreaming but then he comes close and sniffs her and says you're real and I have to pause the film and fan myself.Troubled Mary goes to the church in New Orleans where the priest is a childhood friend to get some answers about her Mother and as he is putting the candles out and turns to Mary  it is him the big D. A gaze to die for. The next is Dracula perched like a gargoyle on the church parapet above the Mardi Gras revelers and he says Farewell Princess. Perfect! Down at street level he walks among the drunken revelers with a bemused look. There is a giant TV screen showing dancers silhouettes there are beads and coins tossed at him as he looks on with a knowing smile. He watches the giant screen flash images of atom bombs rock stars lingerie ads and women mud wrestling and says Brilliant. Great satire!His walk through the Virgin record store is iconic with all the young gals turning to look as he passes by. He gets Lucy Mary's friend to take him to their home. His comment to Lucy when she can't come up with a word to describe Mary's mothers decor of the house catholic? is priceless. And to her query would you like some coffee? he says  I don't drinkcoffee. Timed perfectly with just the right look. And of course he has her on the bed and on the ceiling! Faint!!!It is like there are two films here  one a brilliant satire with great lines. And the other an incoherent teenslasherbloodfest. But it is almost possible to just start anywhere after the first 30 minutes and the story is interesting and makes sense of the Jesus ChristJudas theme.The cinematography has some beautiful scenes. The Red Hall  the curtains blowing and the eastern theme music for the desert and cross scenes. The few lines DraculaButler utters are great and with timing and marvelous expression. The Bible is propaganda. You think you can defend her with the Bible. To Mary Everything I have is yours and all you are is mine. Shades of The Phantom.Dracula to the Jesus Cross I give them revelers below what they crave most. All the pleasures you denied them. And his gesture to Mary  arm and hand out as the camera pans away and he says come let us feast and the kisses. Wow!! Nellie bar the door. I want some of that! 810  would have been higher but that first 30 minutes is just bad!".

Also there's plenty of blood and violence on hand and erotic sexual seduction by Dracula.With the sole exception of Miller the acting is good. Plummer works despite the accent Omar Epps is having a whale of a time Justine Wadell is good and Esposito Ryan and Fitzpatrick make a good team of scary and sexy vampires. Gerard Butler is fantastic as Dracula. He's young VERY handsome has curly black hair and a buff body. Also he portrays Dracula's sexuality and violence very well.

In my opinion Wes Craven here presents the most novel and compelling reenvisioning of the Dracula story since Lugosi. As far as originality and a fresh direction this makes Coppola's production seem like a bloated but tired overproduced rehash. Yes Gary Oldman is a consummate actor and a great Count. But in Francis' version Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves are totally flaccid and uninteresting. And Anthony Hopkins embarrasses himself with such an overthetop portrayal of Van Helsing that I wouldn't be surprised if Oldman hasn't talked to him since. Tony almost seems to be purposely lampooning the story.Don't expect 100 million special effects. Craven had to make do on a shoestring budget. But that seems to have forced him to focus on the story rather than the flash. Butler could certainly have upped the intensity rather than relying so heavily on his dropdead good looks to establish Dracula's charisma. No question Gerard underplays the role though that only seems to add moodiness and atmosphereand is consistent with the character as he is presented in the story. Dracula is so bitter and internally conflicted that he hasn't got a lot to say to his victimsor even his pursuers. Also conflicted is the wonderful Christopher Plummer who is so present in the role of Van Helsing that he really sells the premise of the whole reinvention in the film's first few minutes.For levity Dracula's new brood of followers have a lot of trendy newage comments to make on the pluses and minuses of their new undead status. They come off as Katzenjammer kids with fangsbut as amusing as they are they still bite. They seem to be the only ones really having fun here vampirism as a form of delightful liberation right up until the moment the stake sinks in.As Drac movies go this is a winner. By the way Plummer has been criticized by some reviewers for his curious pronunciation of the Count's honorific. But it is actually proper. If you were addressing him as Count or Vlad yes Dracula would be the correct form. But if it's the only identifier then the single term Draculea just as Plummer pronounces it is correct.Three cheers for the Count. Although Butler isn't quite as pretty here as Langella he's got more to work with as far as engaging and original backstory. And he is spared Olivier's Van Helsing as kvetching crybaby. What it is about Van Helsing? No one did it better than Edward Van Sloan until Plummer came along in the 21st century.".

OK it has almost nothing to do with the Bram stoker version but honestly at the end of the movie i was thinking . I saw almost every Dracula movies ever and the Dracula bram stoker version is with any doubt the best 1 ever with an amazing performance of Garry oldman on the second place Dracula untold 2014 and than this movie.

OK it has almost nothing to do with the Bram stoker version but honestly at the end of the movie i was thinking . I saw almost every Dracula movies ever and the Dracula bram stoker version is with any doubt the best 1 ever with an amazing performance of Garry oldman on the second place Dracula untold 2014 and than this movie. That said if there ever was a real vampire than this movie would get the closed to a logic explanation.

The reason this movie is amazing is because it takes the old Dracula tale that everyone knows and puts it into a modern time situation. It is a fun and enjoyable that keeps you in your seat. The acting in this movie is wonderful actors like Johnny Lee Miller Gerald Gutler Christopher Plummer and Omar Epps did fantastic jobs on their roles. Overall this movie has a great story line above average acting and many more. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good vampire flick or anyone who just wants to sit back and enjoy a great movie. Easy 10 out of 10 no doubt.".

I loved the imaginative writing that formed the premise of the plot for this film. I mean the whole Judas IscariotBetrayalEternally DamnedRedemption themes really resonated with me as it no doubt did for a lot of Vampire fans. On those levels it is comparable to the works of Novelist Anne Rice. The fact that the writers incorporated the history of a 2000 year old Biblical personage into this strange tapestry shows a fresh inventiveness and totally sums up the title.

Sloppy scripting  and there also seems to be a problem with the structure where theres numerous scenes of characters being at the New Orleans mardi gras then the characters being at a different location such as police station in the following scene then theyre back at the mardi gras the scene after that which means the lack of credibilty in the plot is enhanced Theres something else that yanked my chain  Product placement .

He was the best thing about this film and he proved himself to make a fantastic Dracula. You can really understand the sexy darkness of him and it's fabulous. I also loved finding out what the film's theory about Dracula was and believe me it's a fantastic twist but I won't say what it is. This is a must see if only for Gerard Butler and a new theory on Dracula. Certain party scenes are also fantastic and the soundtrack is very modern and rocky which really suits the film and Gerry Butler's take on Dracula. He really is very good and by the end I found myself wanting him to bite me he's very hypnotic when he acts and you can really see it in his eyes especially on the extras on the DVD. Must see so all you women out there will understand what I mean!".

I won't totally doubt that there are some chilling parts of the film and it was smart to bring in Johnny Lee Miller who did good in Trainspotting there his real name was Simon here he is also known as Simon weird huh but that is it.

But there are some new twists.To share those with someone who hasn't seen the movie would be to take away the parts that I enjoyed most so I won't go into them here.Gerard Butler is fantastic at taking creatures that are supposed to be monsters and making them sexy as hell! I first saw him in the title roll of last year's Phantom of Opera. In that he had me wondering if Christine made the right choice at the end of the movie and in this he makes me wonder if being a vampire would be all bad! Christopher Plummer does well in the roll of Van Helsing and the rest of the cast is good. The special effects were well done and spooky. There wasn't an excess of blood and gore I know not a plus to all vampire movie lovers! This movie is only a 7 to me because it clings tightly to the vampire myths at times and disregards them totally in other places. The best example of this is the fact that Dracula hates all things Christian and shuns them. With out giving away why that makes sense it's understandable considering how he became a vampire. Why then aren't the people he makes into vampires just as repelled by crosses and such?In spite of that all in all it wasn't a bad way to spend a Friday night!".

What it reminds me of funny enough is Ladyhawke remember Michelle Pfeiffer?. Once you make this connection however it's not difficult to notice the striking similarity. In both stories the romantic pair do not meet until the very end but for different reasons. In Ladyhawke she is a hawk by day ahd he a wolf by night. The situation in Il Mare is far more complicated and will take some explaining to unravel.Before the unraveling of the Time element in Il Mare it is interesting to note the difference in the way the two endings are handled. In Ladyhawke when the curse was broken and both finally appear together in human form he gave her a fierce embrace lifted her slightly off the ground and spun around in a final scene that fills the audience with ecstasy and joy of a final fulfillment long denied. In Il Mare the finale is handled in a much more reserved manner when they didn't even touch physically. The joy experienced by the audience here is more subtle.Now to Einstein's Theory of Relativity. The mystery of Time has provided the plot for many a movie among the most notable of which are Time Machine Somewhere in Time Back to the Future. Similar to these three the key element in Il mare is an attempt to change something in the past or to create an alternative life line so to speak.We mustn't however let the similarity obscure the one big difference. Unlike any of the other three there's nobody in Il Mare who actually traveled through Time i.e. physically move back to a different Time. This is what makes this movie so clever and unique. It avoids altogether the paradox that haunts the idea of time travel meeting yourself your double.Il Mare does not have this problem. The interaction is only through a magical mail box which delivers letters between two Times 1998 and 2000 to be exact. It all starts in 2000 when the girl puts a letter in the mailbox of the house she is vacating intending it for the next occupant. The reply to her great surprise comes from a guy in 1998. Now we have a situation in which the girl knows in general what has happened since 1998 although she does not know specifically where this guy is in her present of 2000. The guy on the other hand knows that the girl can tell him things that has happened between their respective presents of 1998 and 2000.They finally agrees to meet at a Time that is future to both of them which is two years away for him but just the next week for her. But when he does not show up at the rendezvous she is left wondering whether he has changed he mind. Then comes the final climax when she finds out that he was killed in an accident back in 1998 and desparately tries to send a letter back to warn him. In the happy ending we are back in the opening scene when he shows up BEFORE she puts that first letter in the mail box. The interesting final state of affair is that the guy knows what has gone on before i.e. the exchange of letters including the final one that warns him and saves him from the fatal accident. For the girl however this reality has been wiped out entirely! As far as she is concerned she has never put the first letter in the mail box and will just live happily ever after with this guy she just met.There are other subtleties that I wouldn't go further into. The plot has been very carefully woven with great attention to details. The movie is well written and well acted with lovely music beautiful cinematography and altogether well worth seeing.".

The plot has been very carefully woven with great attention to details. The movie is well written and well acted with lovely music beautiful cinematography and altogether well worth seeing.";

	schema:reviewBody "Subtle melancholic magical. The movie is almost comparable to another Asian film jewel Love Letter 1995 in terms of the subtleness and slow buildup of the plot where the platonic relationship between the protagonists help make the love story almost ethereal and yet very grounded and real at the same time. The love story is polite and decent with different shades of melancholy that at times it edges into sappiness. However this sappiness is only like a pinch of salt which adds additional flavor to the already deliciously rich mood of the film. In terms of storytelling cinematography and acting skills it is almost flawless and after the closing credits it will leave you utterly breathless. The mood will stay with you long after you've seen it  i think that's the magical domain of the film  not only in terms of plot but more so the effect it brings to the viewers. A truly cinematic experience you shouldn't miss!".

	schema:reviewBody "The plot of this movie goes something like this.... A young woman leaving a house called Il Mare because it stands on a pier in the sea leaves a note for the next occupant of the house. The idea is to greet the next occupant and to ask them to send her any mail addressed to her since she expecting some important letters from her boyfriend who's learning animation in America. The letter is picked up by a young man who is an aspiring architect but who works building bridges to pay the rent. He has just moved into Il Mare...as its first tenant...two years before the girl's letter was sent. What transpires is a conversation in letters as boy and girl exchange letters across time.This is a beautiful to look at I love Il Mare the house and to listen to movie I'm going to have to track down the soundtrack. In a way this plays like a time traveling version of 84 Charring Cross Road with much of the story told simply through the letters. In some ways its a story of two isolated people connecting through time even though there is no way they should be able to. I think that one review of the film I read was right in away in that this film is a weird sort of take on the IMing culture as well as anyone who spends too much time on the computer and so isolates themselves from human contact.This also has echoes of Voices of a Distant Star This is a very nice little romance about two people who at first think their connection is a joke and then find that they are somehow becoming friends. For the most part it manages to keep you from thinking about the problems that time travel stories usually engender. Basically if you give yourself over to it you'll have yourself a good time.This isn't to say that there aren't problems there are. As I said the film deals with people who aren't connecting with each other and a good portion of the film is taken up by the two leads moving around not connecting to people. Yes they talk to people The girls best friend runs a manga store and she does voice acting but mostly they are are off in their own little worlds. It gets rather tiring since it feels more like a play than a movie at times the movie in the wrong frame of mind which I was in will make the movie seem much longer than its 95 minutes.Worse I thought I would jump a head...bad mistake since I had to go back to make sense of what I saw Still its a nice romance that moved me I'm not afraid to say I had a tear in my eye. Definitely worth seeing if you're so inclined.7 out of 10 Higher if you're in the right frame of mind".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review DVD Il Mare 2000";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the earlier Korean hits in Singapore was Il Mare starring Jun Jihyun and Lee Jungjae and last year it became the excuse of a remake by Hollywood to reunite Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock on the big screen. If anything good comes out these remakes it is the acknowledgement that Asian stories are finding some legs to travel. There was no hesitation to obtain my copy of this movie when I saw the DVD given that almost all the versions of the movie here was the VCD oneJust so you know where I'm coming from I haven't seen the original and had seen the Hollywood remake first. But if you were to ask me to decide right now which version is superior I would say without hesitation the original Korean one triumphs over the remake simply because as a romance it sure knew how to present it the way it's supposed to be. The way the movies were made is akin to the lake house featured in both movies  the Hollywood one is very grand with plenty of bells and whistles but the Korean one is simpler though by no means less effective in its minimalist look and feel puts the focus of the story squarely on our lovebirds separated by time.The first thing that strikes you is how quiet this movie can be. There is less dialogue and it allows the images do the talking. As the clich goes a picture is worth a thousand words. Containing plenty of beautiful idyllic soft focus shots which contribute to the overall romanticized feel Il Mare is slowly and intricately paced and less complicated with its relationships and its supporting cast is few and not given anything substantial to steal thunder and limelight.This compared to the very Hollywood style of development every minor subplot into a major one and having to explain everything to the audience  this I thought was sledgehammered through in the remake very early on into the film which after watching how it was dealt in the original you'll agree at which version is more superior. There were many instances of homage shots like the red coat the paw prints and the shots of the mailbox as well as adapting plot elements like the train incident and liberties were taken to bring to life some of its supporting casts which were only mentioned in passing in Il Mare. If not for the inflation of run time because of the lack of skill in making a beautiful picture then I don't know what is.Il Mare allows the audience room to piece together clues and events without stifling and this enables a greater appreciation as well as time to be absorbed totally into the lives of our protagonists 2 lonely hearts finding each other through a temporal time warp via a mailbox at Il Mare the name of the Lake House. One's an architect and the other's a voice artistes and both connect heart to heart during the winter season leaving the question of if we can click why not meet up and get together?Jun Jihyun and Lee Jungjae play off each other really well even though they share limited screentime together. Coupled with the way each had their individual scenes shot framed and presented I'd say again you can't help but to feel for these 2 and root for them to transcend hell and high waters to come together.

	onyx:emotionText "One of the earlier Korean hits in Singapore was Il Mare starring Jun Jihyun and Lee Jungjae and last year it became the excuse of a remake by Hollywood to reunite Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock on the big screen. If anything good comes out these remakes it is the acknowledgement that Asian stories are finding some legs to travel. There was no hesitation to obtain my copy of this movie when I saw the DVD given that almost all the versions of the movie here was the VCD oneJust so you know where I'm coming from I haven't seen the original and had seen the Hollywood remake first. But if you were to ask me to decide right now which version is superior I would say without hesitation the original Korean one triumphs over the remake simply because as a romance it sure knew how to present it the way it's supposed to be. The way the movies were made is akin to the lake house featured in both movies  the Hollywood one is very grand with plenty of bells and whistles but the Korean one is simpler though by no means less effective in its minimalist look and feel puts the focus of the story squarely on our lovebirds separated by time.The first thing that strikes you is how quiet this movie can be. There is less dialogue and it allows the images do the talking. As the clich goes a picture is worth a thousand words. Containing plenty of beautiful idyllic soft focus shots which contribute to the overall romanticized feel Il Mare is slowly and intricately paced and less complicated with its relationships and its supporting cast is few and not given anything substantial to steal thunder and limelight.This compared to the very Hollywood style of development every minor subplot into a major one and having to explain everything to the audience  this I thought was sledgehammered through in the remake very early on into the film which after watching how it was dealt in the original you'll agree at which version is more superior. There were many instances of homage shots like the red coat the paw prints and the shots of the mailbox as well as adapting plot elements like the train incident and liberties were taken to bring to life some of its supporting casts which were only mentioned in passing in Il Mare. If not for the inflation of run time because of the lack of skill in making a beautiful picture then I don't know what is.Il Mare allows the audience room to piece together clues and events without stifling and this enables a greater appreciation as well as time to be absorbed totally into the lives of our protagonists 2 lonely hearts finding each other through a temporal time warp via a mailbox at Il Mare the name of the Lake House. One's an architect and the other's a voice artistes and both connect heart to heart during the winter season leaving the question of if we can click why not meet up and get together?Jun Jihyun and Lee Jungjae play off each other really well even though they share limited screentime together. Coupled with the way each had their individual scenes shot framed and presented I'd say again you can't help but to feel for these 2 and root for them to transcend hell and high waters to come together. Watch this movie to find out if they do!!Certainly one of the better romantic tales out there done totally right. Forget about The Lake House make it Il Mare instead!";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a wonderful film. It is the first korean film I ever saw and I was not disappointed at all. Recently the remake of this movie The Lake House came out in the US. I had to see it of course to compare. I still prefer the original.The music in the korean version is just spellbinding and beautiful. It gives a wonderful lovey doveykinda sad mysterious feeling to the whole movie. It kind of connects the whole movie together which I didn't feel in the remake bc they kept using random music that didn't mix well to me.I don't know much about Korea but watching the film gives me more of a sense of how it is over there and how things are different from my own country. The Lake House didn't really give any feel as to how the US country is.. maybe bc it wasn't anything original. There were too many holes in the US version too. And even though I've seen the original a lot the remake confused me a bit even about the time period. don't even get me started on the other changes they made to the plot as well as new characters etc.The korean film left you guessing more and didn't just hand over the whole plot and clenchers like the remake. There was more emotion in the korean and more surprising. It's so dramatic and heart clenching and ugh.. just makes you want to cry.Don't let subtitles scare you away.. go find this movie and watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Il Mare' is a beautiful film  beautifully shot beautifully written beautifully acted. It's as romantic a film as I've seen in years.Two attractive young people live in an isolated beach house two years apart. Each is hiding from unhappiness and lack of fulfillment. When the young woman moves out she leaves a note in the house's ornate mailbox asking the house's next occupant to forward her mail. She is hoping for a letter from her lover who is studying abroad and from whom she has not heard in some time.When she gets a reply it is from a young man who claims that he is the house's first occupant and he doesn't know how her letter got into the mailbox but that he'll keep his eyes open for her mail. The young woman moved out of the house in 1999 the young man's letter is dated 1997. They are living two years apart but the house's ornate mailbox somehow makes it possible for them to correspond.Over the course of their correspondence they open to each other and it becomes obvious that they are soulmates. But . . . they are living in parallel universes separated by two years. She tells him exactly where she will be on one day two years previously and he goes and sees her but of course she has no idea who he is.The story moves forward inevitably but unpredictably and there are almost guaranteed to be tears at the end. But more than the story and more than the strength and beauty of the film's stars what impresses is the way the story is told through ravishing colors perfectly composed images amazing cinematography even beautiful music. Music can be the downfall of Korean romantic films. There is hardly a frame of this film that could not be frozen and framed.See it before Hollywood gets hold of it and spoils it. It's all over eBay with perfectly good English subtitles. This is one to own.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those rare films that is so close to being perfect that any criticism of it seems like nitpicking. It begins with a scene showing the female lead Eunju moving out of a lonely house by the sea called Il Mare. Eunju has written a letter to whoever rents out the house next asking him or her to forward any mail addressed to her to her new apartment. She dates the letter late 1999 and puts it in the house's letterbox. We then see Sunghyon Il Mare's original occupant moving into the house two years earlier. Somehow Eunju's letter from 1999 has turned up in his mailbox. The two begin to correspond and the lonely Sunghyon and heartbroken Eunju find that they were made for each other  but can they ever be together?The film focuses almost entirely on Eunju and Sunghyon's evolving relationship and therefore there are only a handful of other characters in the film none of whom have significant roles. The film spends such a long time developing the relationship between Eunju and Sunghyon that it becomes entirely believable and profound unlike so many films where the two characters simply have to look into each other's eyes to fall in love. The two characters are so likable and so lonely that we hope terribly that their relationship will succeed.Somehow the fantastical element of the plot doesn't make it any less believable. Rather it makes one reflect on how quickly time passes and how two years into the future can seem a long time but two years into the past can seem like no more than a few months. Nitpickers will criticise the film because of the inevitable anomalies that the concept of time travel causes but it is easy to overlook these slight imperfections. Furthermore the complete absence of sex violence and language is a blessing.It's a beautifully photographed film with a very beautiful story which  as one reviewer suggested  should be seen with someone you love sitting beside you. It's one of those films that will stay with you for a while after you see it  I found I was still thinking about the characters days later. I confess a tear came to my eye at the end. But was it a tear of joy or sorrow? Watch the film and find out for yourself. This is one of only four films I've ever given 10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember watching Il Mare aka Siworae back in the day shortly after it was initially released. And I do remember it as being a very beautiful movie. So I sat down yesterday to watch it again for the third time.And while Il Mare does have a very nice and original story then it was a tad slow paced which could be somewhat of a challenge for some audience to get through. However I think that it is alright with a slow paced storyline here because director Hyunseung Lee uses the time quite well to tell a very beautiful and touching story.The story told in Il Mare is about a lovestory between Kim Eunju played by Jihyun Jun and Han Sunghyun played by Jungjae Lee. They are sending each other letters from a mailbox at an oceanside house named Il Mare. Kim Eunju is living in 1999 and Han Sunghyun is living in 1997. And even with two years apart their love grows with each letter.It is indeed a very interesting storyline and one that has originality and sinks right in because it is really welltold by the director.And while the cast list in Il Mare is relatively small then there is a bigger pressure on the leading stars to perform well enough to hold up the movie. And I will say that both Jungjae Lee and Jihyun Jun did more than perform adequately. They really carried the movie quite well both individually and together on the screen.Il Mare is a beautiful movie to grace the South Korean cinema and it is a movie that is wellworth watching regardless of you having a preference for Asian cinema or not.".

	schema:reviewBody "Il Mare is a film about love story between two people separated by time. It touches the theme about long distance relationship. The plot is original and refreshing. In fact Hollywood picked it up and remade it into a film that reunited the stars of SpeedKeanu Reeves and Sandra Bullockentitled Lake House. The acting was excellent. Both Lee Jungjae and Jun JiHyunwere great as lovers writing letter to each other and sending it to the mysterious mailbox. The cinematography was commendable as well. The ending can be very sad and the last scene may provide confusion to a lot of viewers. But overall the film is a mustsee not only for Jun Ji Hyun fans but for people who have appreciate great love stories. How does Il Mare compare to the Hollywood remakeLake House?Il Mare was a lot better than The Lake House. Here are the reasons why.1. Il Mare keeps the audience guessing as to what is going to happen next while the plot is clichd in The Lake House.2. You care more about Han Sunghyun and Kim Eunju in the Korean version as compared to Alex and Kate in the Hollywood version. Credit that to Jun JiHyun's performance as she has the ability to make you sympathize with her characters in her films. While in the Hollywood version Keanu Reeves is not fit for any kind of romantic leads for he is more suited for action films like Speed and the Matrix.3. There was more emotion in the Korean version as compared to that of the Hollywood version. You know that the leads do care a lot for each other. 4. The Korean version focused on both leads and their loneliness while the Hollywood version involved more characters which made the viewer felt less for the emotions of the leads.5. Finally the use of mailbox and writing letters was probably still common in South Korea during 1997 and 1999 in the Korean version while the use of emailgoogle and the internet was already a way of life in the United States during 2004 and 2006 in the Hollywood version which made the plot of The Lake House less realistic and presented more plot holes. For movie fans check Il Mare instead of The Lake House.".

	schema:reviewBody "Attack the Gas Station! is an effective show case for 4 young stars and goes some way to prove that the newly revitalised Korean cinema has a lot to offer. Anarchic briskly staged and with some genuinely funny moments it is a film which could be remade to good effect in the West I can see Kevin Spacey as the beleagued station owner for instance although I doubt that all of the verve could be recaptured for this is a young man's film angry and alert to wider issues.If they move kill them is a running joke through the film as the number of hostages increases and whether or not a deliberate reference to Peckinpah's Wild Bunch its still funny. The least convincing aspect of the film is the flashbacks. While useful in providing some background and character motivation for the main characters their previous lives seems sketched in too cursorily and in result the young men lose dramatic weight. It's as if that once away from the scene of their most important and direct influence they are morally enervated. Their stature is only significant the film seems to suggest as the principals go on and take direct group action. Part of this is deliberate as their past frustration undoubtedly feeds their current boredom and anger yet one feels that much of the same ground could have been covered by some relevant interaction between the four who leave their personal demons resolutely undiscussed.More interesting is what the Gas Station represents this viewer feels that to some extent it is Korea in microcosm. Just as Japanese cinema has repeatedly reworked the trauma of nuclear holocaust into its science fiction and fantasy films so the peculiar nature of the local NorthSouth Korean standoff and mutual hostility is echoed in this film in which the ending threatens a peculiarly lunatic and mutually achieved apocalypse through petrol and lighters. Clearly continued tension plays a part in the national psyche and the repeated requests to 'fix it'the phone has wider implications as far as national communication or understanding is concerned.The contempt poured upon the glib national slogans hanging in the wall is one explicit political disaffection. As the film proceeds and the shiny new gas station a manifestation in itself of the hitherto 'economic miracle' of the east is increasingly the scene of mini power struggles escalating standoffs and threats of destruction. This is a Korea in which changes are demanded or annihilation surely follows and in which no one it appears wants to be 'boss' or take responsibility as the station owner's ready relinquishment of authority suggests. A country in which one might as well balance upside down on one's head pointlessly and endlessly as achieve any dialogue. And as the final scene shows a forecourt packed with Koreans ready to destroy themselves is both bitterly ironic and ruthlessly apt.".

Clearly continued tension plays a part in the national psyche and the repeated requests to 'fix it'the phone has wider implications as far as national communication or understanding is concerned.The contempt poured upon the glib national slogans hanging in the wall is one explicit political disaffection. As the film proceeds and the shiny new gas station a manifestation in itself of the hitherto 'economic miracle' of the east is increasingly the scene of mini power struggles escalating standoffs and threats of destruction. This is a Korea in which changes are demanded or annihilation surely follows and in which no one it appears wants to be 'boss' or take responsibility as the station owner's ready relinquishment of authority suggests. A country in which one might as well balance upside down on one's head pointlessly and endlessly as achieve any dialogue. And as the final scene shows a forecourt packed with Koreans ready to destroy themselves is both bitterly ironic and ruthlessly apt.";

	schema:reviewBody "The DVD box says This film either serves as a political parable about Korean society a microcosm of Korean social problems or alternately just a hell of a lot of fun. I couldn't sum it up any better.Attack the Gas Station! can be many things... or nothing at all. Therein lies the mark of a great work of art. I'm not familiar with Korean politics or society so I can't comment on whether it's a fitting allegory for those... but I personally saw this film as a brilliant immorality play and definitely a lot of fun.Like the classic morality plays of the 15th century it uses characters to personify certain human virtues  vices. However unlike a classic morality play which is supposed to teach a moral lesson Attack the Gas Station! draws no moral conclusions ...except maybe that you should never pss off Chinese food delivery boys. They can get nasty.Instead of moralizing over right  wrong this film simply tells it like it is. The plot  premise is summed up in the title a bunch of hoodlums decide to attack a gas station. They do it for no real reason other than just because. If you're a fan of Camus The Stranger and certain other influential writers of the 20th century already you see an interesting theme of existentialism here.As the film progresses we see that theme become more powerful. Characters answer to no higher morality other than their own individual instincts. Good  bad become irrelevant. Actions reactions and situations seem almost random. Folks if I were to teach a 10th grade English class about Existentialism I'd say to heck with Camus Sartre  all those heady books... just watch Attack the Gas Station! and have a blast.On the flip side if you watch this movie and try to judge what's right  wrong you may hate it. Like Pulp Fiction the lines of right  wrong are erased and often the most likable characters are the ones who are doing horrible things.OK enough of that deep stuff. Let's assume the movie is just intended to be a hell of a lot of fun. It's definitely a comedy but the comedy isn't in your face. It's more like an absurdist comedy where the situations are so bizarre you can't help but laugh. In that respect it reminded me of Buuel's 1962 surrealist classic Exterminating Angel. In the DVD interview the director of Attack the Gas Station! states that the gas station is designed to represent a fantasy bubble separate from the rest of the world where peoples' true natures come out and anything goes.Also in the DVD interview he mentions that each of the 4 main characters represents a different emotional aspect and the 4 put together represent a complete individual. I can't remember exactly who represents what and you'll probably have more fun figuring that out for yourself but for example Mad Dog may represent frustration Rock Star may represent regret etc.The presentation itself is stylish hip and fast paced like an MTV video. It may remind you of Amelie or other JeanPierre Jeunet films who himself claims to be influenced by Japanese and Korean films. If you're familiar with Asian cinema think of Kamikaze Girls or Cutie Honey live action. But there are also some sober moments giving us time to reflect on the deeper significance... if there is any.Like I said Attack the Gas Station! can be many things... or nothing at all. The best part is that it doesn't pretend to be anything so it's up to you. I highly recommend it for a philosophicalsociopolitical mind trip as well as a mindless actioncomedy flick. See it if you get the chance.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can definitely see the cult potential of this movie but is the actual movie itself being that good? Not really.Of course it's a very entertaining movie to watch but also a real simple and shallow one. It isn't being that terribly clever with its story and it mostly purely relies on its main concept of having a bunch of anarchist youngsters taking over a gas station holding employees and costumers prisoned while a whole bunch of other crazy stuff is happening. And yes the concept of the movie does make this movie fun but in terms of being a comedy this movie really isn't being clever or even funny enough.The movie doesn't do a very good job with fleshing out its characters or making them interesting or compelling ones. It makes the whole movie a quite distant one to watch and it also turns it a bit into a long sit even though the movie itself is just under 2 hours so nothing that long in itself actually.The story itself just doesn't ever take the trouble to take itself serious or believable. This is of course the right approach for a comedy of this sort to take but it actually more often comes across as some lazy writing. Seriously these guys didn't even had real weapons but yet nobody attempts seriously to escape even though the numbers are being heavily in their favor. And sometimes characters just disappear out of the story or add nothing to it at all. In the end the movie does feel like an ultimately pointless one.It was also obviously a quite cheap movie to make which can mostly been seen back in the entire way and style the movie got shot in. Most of the people involved with this movie come across as talented ones but they still made tons of mistakes with this movie. At multiple times throughout the movie its clearly getting day while the entire movie is supposed to be set during one night and it shouldn't be in the morning till at the very end of the movie.So plenty of criticism about this movie yet it was still one that I enjoyed watching. Despite everything I regard this movie as a perfect one to kill some time with. It doesn't stand out in any way but it at least is something unlike anything else. Despite that the movie is not being really clever with its story or concept it's still being an original movie to watch. This of course has also everything to do with the fact that you are watching a South Korean movie here so it's unlike anything else that you would usually watch or would expect to see unless you are Korean yourself of course. And yes there are also definitely being some good and fun moments in this movie that help to make it an entertaining one to watch.But in truth the movie did really seem to have far more potential in it. It seemed to try to make some statement regarding humangroup behavior and it almost seemed to me as if it was going for a A Clockwork Orange done more comedystyle like approach. Needless to say that the movie does not really work out as a social commentary but does this take away any of the fun of this movie? I think not.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "A group of 4 dissatisfied and bored youths set out to smash up and demolish an all night gas station. They soon find that they can make more money if they pose as staff fuel peoples vehicles and keep the earnings.The film is constantly amusing and entertaining with some great characters that despite being nameless except for 'Bulldozer' are still likable regardless of their motives. That may sound odd as afterall the 4 lead characters are technically the bad guys of the film due to the fact that they are out causing trouble simply because they are bored. And yet you feel no animosity towards them and they are all likable and entertaining right from the start without any need to build up any sympathies for them. There are some tiny flashback moments and while these may explain some of the characters motivation the movie would of worked just as well without them.The movie is well shot and well acted and keeps up its amusing entertaining pace throughout its almost 2 hour duration.There are many great moments littered throughout. I especially liked a scene where one of the characters breaks open a vending machine to steal the change which he subsequently uses in another vending machine to buy a drink.Other highlights include things such as the best way to get a bit of background music whilst they are working and why Pepsi might be Korean.The events that unfold at the gas station are a clever social commentary on the state of Korea the gas station itself actually representing the country and the people representing the North or South and other nations.Those that don't pick up on the message I didn't the first time I watched it or don't care about the social commentary should still enjoy this as it is an excellent funny and entertaining movie. The only downside for me is that the subtitles on my version seem to suffer from being poorly translated at times but that doesn't detract from understanding events or from the enjoyment of the film overall.".

	schema:reviewBody "To make a memorable mark in the comedy genre nowadays is quite a difficult thing to do. With movies that recycle the same tasteless toilet humour and clichd teenage sex antics comedy is a genre that has slowly been dying in the mainstream for the last decade. Korean comedy veteran SangJin Kim's Attack the Gas Station is a hysterically different take on comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously but comes through with some seriously entertaining comedy. Before seeing this film for the first time I didn't expect much from the title and all but I was very surprised on the humour and direction of Attack the Gas Station.Attack the Gas Station is the wacky story of a gang of 4 Korean youths who have a bad case of boredom so what better to do then rob the local gas station?! After the high of the robbery wears off the 4 teenagers find themselves right where they were before the robbery bored. The only solution they can come up with is to rob the gas station again! As the gang attends to the customers to keep all quiet they realize that instead of just robbing the place they can make even more money by keeping the money that the patrons give them for pumping their gas! Soon after a group of high school wannabe thugs come to collect money from one of the gas station employees. After rubbing the robbers the wrong way our main gang decide to teach the wannabes a lesson and take them hostage too! Somewhere along the line their antics lead them to taking a snotty premadonna hostage who's boyfriend just happens to be in the yakuza and pissing off a highly irritable delivery boy who decides that he isn't going to take it anymore! Aside from the hilarious action that takes place the film has a nice underlying tone of the gang comically bonding with the now supportive gas station employees as they teach each other to stand up for what they believe in and cooperate to take down what soon will be slew of opposing gangs waging war on the gas station! Attack the Gas Station does not have any big name actors no recognizable faces but the acting is enjoyable. SangJin Kim is known for his knack of directing new talent. The feel of the movie is real enough given the crazy premise and the ride you go on with the cast is highly enjoyable and incredibly funny.You wouldn't see Attack the Gas Station winning any Oscars or sweeping any film festivals because that's not the aim of this film. Attack the Gas Station is a semiserious comical ride of what some slightly confused youth do when they're bored and nothing more. There is no camera art and no first grade performances but I doubt that is what anyone going into this film expects. From the opening you understand what level to suspend your disbelief.Attack the Gas Station is a refreshing take on comedy that finds a very original and comical way to entertain its audience while not wasting their time. Its pace is swift and fluid. From a very comical opening to a final parking lot battle between our new found heroes some very scared high schoolers the yakuza and a group of angst filled delivery boys Attack the Gas Station is a spin on comedy that shouldn't be passed up.".

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of reviewers have mentioned the social commentary in this movie. Oh it's great because of the social commentary. Social commentary! Well that may be the subtext but the reality is that anyone who showed up at the gas station with a gun or even a knife would have gotten the best of these idiots in about two seconds. Better yet anyone over 5'4 150 could have just knocked any of them over. There's absolutely nothing scary about any of these characters who are either vainly tossing their hair around and playing bar 80s techno misunderstood little boys lashing out because they miss their parents hurting inside because their daddy didn't support their desire to be an artist or preparing for a Karate Kid remake by screaming at everyone. It seemed like the actors had watched too many American movies and were trying to imitate characters they'd seen before. At times it was so obvious it was embarrassing. One guy just had a long stick and yelled loudly which intimidated everyone. Anyone could have easily grabbed it from him and game over. One guy tried to pull the thousand yard stare on everyone which got uncomfortable because he's got nothing to back it up. The dumb blond guy with long hair is not at all intimidating but he's playing the unpredictable crazy role. Never know what this got will do. Ooooooooh.This movie seemed to be attempting A Clockwork Orange mixed with Warriors but in Korean. The main reason it wasn't successful was because none of their hostages seemed to put up any real fight. The owner of the place kept the money hidden even after being tortured. None of these guys appeared tough or even scary. Nobody really tried to escape and they even intimidated the police successfully. With no weapons? Not bloody likely. It's beyond silly. The reason why a movie like Clockwork worked was because these were really intimidating guys who weren't afraid to kill or rape. They were genuinely not all there and showed that they could win in a fight. The gang in this movie win their fights with virtually no resistance and they do not come off as tough at all. There's nothing to recommend them and you are rooting against them throughout. Antiheroes are perfectly ok but these guys didn't even have enough substance to be considered anti heros. The movie was too long and way too repetitive and boring. Nothing really happens and their lame attempt to inject humor into the situation was an utter failure. Social commentary or not there are way better ways to show the disillusionment of Korean youth wrought by the Asian Financial Crisis. You would have a better time visiting a gas station than watching this movie.".

The movie was too long and way too repetitive and boring. Nothing really happens and their lame attempt to inject humor into the situation was an utter failure. Social commentary or not there are way better ways to show the disillusionment of Korean youth wrought by the Asian Financial Crisis. You would have a better time visiting a gas station than watching this movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "This film is rarely seen anywhere which is a shame. It has a more balanced view of the subject than you would imagine coming as it does from China the main victim of the story it portrays. This latest showing the first time I have seen it was on Sunday 20th October 2002 on the nationwide Arte television channel based in Hamburg Germany. The theme of the evening was Queen Victoria and the Opium War was the unusual and bold first choice of a group of 3 programmes the other two coming conventionally from Germany and Britain. One could never imagine the BBC or ITV daring to be so inventive if they presented such a themed evening in Britain. I should declare an interest as a Brit and one who lived in Hong Kong under the colonial govt for 12 years leaving in the mid nineties and having spent a considerable time working in China. This film doesn't just get a bad press it gets NO press !It deals with a subject which has been THE major thorn in China's dealings with the West over the past 150 years and the single most important factor in forming China's foreign policy strategy right up until the present day. The film is seemingly unobtainable in the west either on DVD or VHS. This particular viewing was all dubbed into German so I cannot comment on the authenticity on the use of Cantonese dialect in the southern scenes and the use of Mandarin in the Beijing and Tianjin episodes. However it is most unlikely that these would not be addressed bearing in mind the fim maker. Similarly as there are genuine British actors in the film one would imagine their contribution to be reasonably authentic  certainly their body language was throughout.Your first thoughts about this film would most likely immediately be to dismiss it as pure communist government propaganda especially being released in 1997 the year of the handback of Hong Kong to China.  But you would be very rash to make such a judgement. Many of the characters are drawn with sympathetic care both on the Chinese and the foreign sides and an authentic attempt to show the real causes of the war is made.  Yes there are stereotypes but not as many as to cause you to lose your interest in the film's main theme.This story needs to be told and for the British to acknowledge openly and without reservation what they did and the reasons why they did it. Interesting that they still really have not done so. Hong Kong to the average British person means designer clothes Chinese takeaways and the opium war is still a large blank in the consciousness for most of the population.The Germans have come to terms with what they did 60 years ago it's time we learnt from their example and did the same with our own actions more than a century ago enslaving an entire nation with governmentsponsored illegal drug trafficking on a huge scale. If we tried that policy today we would be the pariah of the UN !See this film if you can  it is admittedly not a firstrank masterpiece partially because of the stilted scenery especially the foreign concession which looks rather like part of Disney's Adventureland and partially because of the lack of realism in certain parts of the battle scenes  the British army seems to have a suspiciously high proportion of oriental recruits! However it is an opportunity to see an historical injustice from the side of the victims at last and in a manner which any fairminded person ought to acknowledge as remarkably unbiased in the circumstances.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Opium War is an historical event that heralded the beginning of the end for the Qing Dynasty and the Chinese Empire as a whole. However despite its name the roots of Opium War do not only lie in the drug or its addiction. Opium corruption mismanagement and a gross underestimate of the West's projection power are only some of the many complex reasons that led to the First Opium War.In Yapian Zhanzheng Opium War historical events are depicted in a fairly accurate manner concentrating on the main facts and events. Different aspects of the situation are presented the Emperor's dilemmas BritishWestern interests Commissioner Lin's character the opium merchant the corrupt officials etc... The film however lacks depth and emotion. The viewer is kept on the outside and cannot identify with any character bar young He who is forced into the story so as to add a human dimension to the story.From a historical perspective the film also tends to simplify certain aspects of the situation. One would think that there only were half a dozen merchants in Canton and that the whole war was caused by Captain Elliott. The power of merchants and their trade is briefly mentioned but only incidentally as are power politics at the Imperial Court and at Parliament internal turmoil national and international political strategy and many other factors that led to the War.Overall viewing of this film is recommended to gain a overview of major events certain scenes are also quite spectacular. But do not watch for an indepth historical analysis or representation of the Opium War.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Opium War is an historical event that heralded the beginning of the end for the Qing Dynasty and the Chinese Empire as a whole. However despite its name the roots of Opium War do not only lie in the drug or its addiction. Opium corruption mismanagement and a gross underestimate of the West's projection power are only some of the many complex reasons that led to the First Opium War.In Yapian Zhanzheng Opium War historical events are depicted in a fairly accurate manner concentrating on the main facts and events. Different aspects of the situation are presented the Emperor's dilemmas BritishWestern interests Commissioner Lin's character the opium merchant the corrupt officials etc... The film however lacks depth and emotion. The viewer is kept on the outside and cannot identify with any character bar young He who is forced into the story so as to add a human dimension to the story.From a historical perspective the film also tends to simplify certain aspects of the situation. One would think that there only were half a dozen merchants in Canton and that the whole war was caused by Captain Elliott. The power of merchants and their trade is briefly mentioned but only incidentally as are power politics at the Imperial Court and at Parliament internal turmoil national and international political strategy and many other factors that led to the War.Overall viewing of this film is recommended to gain a overview of major events certain scenes are also quite spectacular. But do not watch for an indepth historical analysis or representation of the Opium War.";

	schema:reviewBody "What kid did not fantasize at one time or another being left alone completely unsupervised for a long long LONG period of time?   To be allowed to say or do whatever he pleased whenever he pleased.  To eat anything he wanted to go to bed late to not go to school to act or behave as he pleased without reproach.  To be his own adult.  Usually those kind of thoughts permeated our little minds right after a heavyduty punishment.  In 1990's Home Alone we saw a broad comical take on this fantasy.  With 1963's Lord of the Flies we get to experience the flip side.Lord of the Flies was required reading in junior high school.  William Golding's dark sobering allegory set during wartime London tells the story of a large group of young schoolboys airlifted out of England who are left to their own devices after a plane crash leaves them marooned on an uninhabited isle with no surviving adults.  As the boys struggle to adapt to their crude but strangely exotic Robinson Crusoe existence the troop begins to splinter into two opposing sects after failing to come to terms on an autonomous code of ethics.  Most of the boys decide to revel in their unsupervised freedom reverting to primitive animallike behavior while resorting to barbaric acts and ritualistic practices.  A conch shell becomes the embodiment of power a boar's head a symbol of lordly conquest.  On the other side a minority group try to repel the tempting force of evil by forming a more civilized commune.  Eventually the survival of the fittest factor sets in as the anointed leader of the hostile group incites violence to force an autocracy. Golding's fascinating premise certainly does not hold much hope for the future of mankind.  We are conditioned as a people to be civilized it is an acquired trait NOT an inherent trait    according to the author.  And if and when the shackles of goodness and purity are at any time removed to the extent that we are allowed to become our own social and moral dictator we will invariably revert back to what comes naturally.  And with a child who has been lessconditioned it will take little time at all.  Evil is stronger easier and much more seductive.  When playing good guys and bad guys as a kid which did YOU prefer to be?Boasting a surprisingly natural cast of amateur actors and directed by radical stage director Peter Brook MaratSade this lowbudget British effort impressively captures much of the novel's backtonature symbolism that I found so powerful and fascinating.   The young masters representing good and evil James Aubrey Ralph and Tom Chapin Jack effectively portray the resolute leaders of the two disparate tribes while butterball Hugh Edwards as the bespectacled philosophical Piggy and towheaded Tom Gaman as the quietly sensitive Simon are touching as two of the weaker followers who become likely targets of the surrounding chaos and burgeoning brutality.  What I love most about this cast is that they act like little boys not little actors grounding their often awkward actions and behaviors in reality.  Trivia note one of the secondary boy players is none other than Nicholas Hammond who went on to play young Friedrich in the film classic The Sound of Music two years later.Brook's use of grainy blackandwhite photography plus the lack of any comprehensive musical score remember Tom Hanks' Castaway? accentuates the bleakness of its surroundings and feelings of isolation.  The movie can hardly be expected to capture fully every single intention of this highly complex novel most don't but it does respect Golding's words and captures the very essence of what he wanted to say.  For that alone it should be applauded. By the way don't waste your time on the 1990 color remake featuring professionals like Balthazar Getty.  The poetic beauty is all but dissipated in this haphazard jarringly Americanized update.  It makes me worship Peter Brook's version even more.And what story could BE more disturbing yet topical than The Lord of the Flies as it applies to today's latchkey society?".

I found it to be quite good and a hell of a lot better than the 1990 version which alters all too many important moments and characteristics of the book. Reading over these comments I was very confused. 1. The story and moral of Lord Of The Flies is so haunting and powerful that it does not need an overly dramatic score. The tune that Jack and his choir sing around the island is just the right touch. 2. Of course the acting wasn't as amazing as it could have been! Everyone seems to be forgetting just how young and inexperienced these boys were. Besides the character's in Golding's story are just as young and act their age however violent and disturbing it may be. I found the camera work to be quite lovely. The film uses beautiful shots which only enhance it even more. The final scene is one of my favorites. My only bone to pick is how quickly the film goes through the events in the book. I really do wish it would have slowed down a bit and concentrated more on such characters as Simon as well as the boys transformation into savages. Overall I found this adaption of Lord Of The Flies to be fantastic. My advice to future viewers of this film is to read the book first definitely watch this 1963 version afterwardsand completely avoid the 1990 version all together.".

Brook did not attempt a straight adaptation he presented Golding's story through his own vision and emotional lens.The use of nonprofessional children is one of the things that make this a brilliant film and vastly superior to the obnoxious 1990's version. If you pay attention to the opening minutes of Brook's film you will notice that the world presented is nice normal clean and functional. The boys deliver their lines well and the story flows smoothly. Once the boys are on the island the scenes aren't nearly so smooth in transition the speech becomes very awkward and the boys interaction with each other is stilted and unnatural.That is the point! These children know the direction they are going is wrong to a boy they know this. Yet as individuals they are helpless to stand up to the group. Their awkwardness flows from their fear of being cast out while yearning to be rescued and return to their homes. The nightmarish quality of the situation is well reflected in the hesitant speech and graceless movements. The uneasy stringing together of scenes makes the viewer squirm hopefully making the connection to how ill at ease and unnatural the boys themselves must feel.I'm sure most of you have been around boys of this age at some point in your life. They are prone to being tonguetied have few social graces and lack physical coordination. That's what makes this film so utterly believable the boys are real boys not pimpedout Hollywood trick ponies delivering their lines in perfect Shakespearean English while nimbly doing complicated dance moves and mugging their perfect little faces square at the camera.Golding's book is a masterpiece that can be taken on several levels. Brook's film offers no fewer interpretations of the deeper meaning while presenting a realistic and horrific vision of the basic story. I know most people simply will not get this film.

There are no false notes especially in the principals.

While back in 1954 kids killing each other took some strong believing today you can see Golding's prediction being chillingly accurate. Nine years later stage director Peter Brook would direct the film version that generated many mixed reviews. Some called it unprofessional and rushed while others praised it as a classic. When the terrible American remake was released in 1990 many looked back at this version as a classic and rightly so.     Brook's film opens with a very creepy montage consisting of pictures of a British boarding school intercut with planes flying over London with a haunting school chorus playing in the background. We learn that the world has been caught in a nuclear war and all the kids in the school were evacuated on planes. One plane crashes into the sea during a thunderstorm. The only survivors are kids ranging from six to twelve years old. Knowing they are trapped on a deserted island they decide to restart civilization.     The leader is Ralph James Aubrey one of the oldest kids who calls on assemblies with a conch. His buddy is Piggy Hugh Edwards a fat nerdy kid with glasses who is ignored by the other children even knowing he is the most mature. The bully is Jack Tom Chaplin a trouble chorus leader who quickly evolves to a Nerolike totalitarian leader and begins to lead the boys into savagery. The neutreal Christlike figure is quiet Simon Tom Gaman who fails to fit in with others. The kids eventually split up to two tribes after many disagreements one tribe consists of savage hunters led by Jack while the other tribe led by Ralph is worried about being rescued.     Like the book Peter Brook's THE LORD OF THE FLIES is a parable of the world under different political views. Piggy and the conch represent order and are both eventually ignored. Ralph represents a democracy while Jack represents a totalitarian form of leadership. Simon represents Christianity although he is also ignored for most of the time. The kids undergo many conflicts most ending in tragic results.      Today Golding's novel is a subject in many school discussions and some people today criticize it for being unrealistic and irrational. But after all it is a parable. In real life it is obvious the kids wouldn't last for very long.      Not believing professional child actors would deliver acting strong enough to portray such characters Brook decided to cast nonactors that lived close to the island of shooting. This benefits the film greatly since Brook coaches great performances out of the kids were some of them really acting? and the fact that the actors are all unknown adds to the realism This technique could be compared to the recent CITY OF GOD. But the film's secondary performances are not as good. The kids usually take long pauses in between their lines and for most of the time they seem to be reading them. Poorly reading them in fact. To make things worse the movie was dubbed on postproduction due to the lowbudget. This makes some of the scenes awkward mute and out of synch. May I also add the scenes are edited abruptly making the whole thing seem rushed. It's sad that the film had to be cut to 90 minutes considering an extra 30 minutes of footage would improve it. This process slows down the film making it sometimes boring and tiresome.     This by no means is a bad movie. Brooks direction and Tom Hallimans cinematography put the 1990 remake to shame. The island locations Puerto Rico look dark and menacing in BW the kind of atmosphere the remake lacked. Brook is able to compose beautiful sad visuals. SPOILERS These include the kinetic editing during the hunt for Ralph Simon's dead body floating in the water arranged by the sad school chorus depressing moment Piggy's tragic demise that puts the 1990s remake laughable mirrored scene to shame and the very scary feast that occurs at night followed by the dance. That scene consisting of quick images scary closeups on the savages painted faces and disturbing screaming is very strong even for today's standards. Brook is also wise on deciding to omit the Lord of the Flies scene and only suggesting it. He does a batter job at it than Harry Hook did in the remake. Imagine the pain of actually filming that scene. END OF SPOILERS     While the outofsynch audio some poor acting and slow pacing might keep this movie away from the recent generation it is still an underrated classic on its own right. It is disturbing haunting and visually wonderful. It really deserves to be seen twice to be really appreciated. Strongly recommended for those that never read the book and an essential preference over the remake.  45".

My immediate association was with my and other Third World countries where many children are abandoned by the Government in their poor communities and without education perspectives in life and laws become very young criminals working in gangs of drug dealers and thieves. In this movie it is exposed how primitive a kid can be without the authority and respect and this sort of violence is in the headlines of our newspapers almost every day.

Then why am I not offended by this movie as I was by Lord of the Rings?This film is an excellent translation of Golding's novel. It is stark bold and well directed. The young cast are frighteningly talented especially Chapin and Edwards. This has everything I expected and much more. Perhaps I was wishing for a more vivid Lord of the Flies scene but it brought it's message across and kept everything in the book alive. I marvel every time I see Edwards' Piggy. I can't understand the capacity the boy had at such an age. Jack was well portrayed also as was Ralph.The ending was perfect. I admit the music did throw me off a tad but everything else just came so willingly. The emotions of the boys practically leaked out through to me and that one little boy in particular I've forgotten his name I'm afraid  is it Percy? looking up at the seacaptain just personified everything that the ending symbolised.

Finally it was decided to attempt the film as a sort of Drama Workshop. Thus it was that 30 boys plus director Peter Brook a film crew and the regulation chaperones found themselves living in a bunk house which had been an old canning factory on the island of Vieques off Puerto Rico with little more than copies of the novel and an outline of the idea and the limitation of the school holidays in which to make the film.The result defies belief. This is a masterpiece of Youth Drama years ahead of its time. Even today 40 years on it is still staggering in its truth and clarity. The powerful imagery chilling in its simplicity far transcends anything which could be achieved with present day digital trickery. Not for this film the obvious blood and guts of action horror here we have the most unspeakable acts made far more terrifying by their very understatement. Simon's death must be one of the foulest acts ever filmed  but then in reality it was not  it is all in the imagination of the viewer and becomes far more terrible than any actual depiction of the act of  ritualistic murder could ever be!.When the great day of reckoning comes this film will stand head and shoulders above all other film adaptations of novels.".

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSLord of the Flies 1963 is a film based on William Golding's 1954 novel which went by the same name. This film like its written counterpart can be taken two different ways. In one aspect Lord of the Flies is an enjoyable adventure story with several elements of horror as well. From another pointofview the position William Golding obviously took when he wrote his novel Lord of the Flies is an paradigm of human nature. The film does its novel justice in discussing both literally and figuratively the primordial nature of man and how the superego plays a major role.Symbolism is abundant in this film. Ralph the protagonist represents democracy and rightness while Jack the antagonist represents totalitarianism and wrongness. Furthermore the conch Ralph uses to attempt to establish rules represents governmental order and decorum. While Ralph struggles with a small amount of boys to build huts representing safety and man's dependence on nature Jack is out with his hunters killing pigs signifying their fall into savagery.Piggy Ralph's sidekick of sorts is asthmatic and unwilling to help with chores but nonetheless represents intelligence and clearsightedness. The fact that Piggy is mocked ignored and the object of derision exemplifies the real life fact that true intelligence is usually not paid any attention. When Piggy is killed the conch is shattered into thousands of little fragments. This represents the complete termination of any sense of intelligence rationality or order the island may have at once had.Simon the most introspective of the characters and a true loner represents Jesus Christ. He faints when the choir boys first meet Ralph and he offers some of his meat to Piggy when no one else would share with the corpulent young boy. Early in the novel a young boy with a mulberry birthmark raises the question of a beast which he says he saw moving through the foliage one night. Simon says it was him going to meditate but the littlun's the small children are still nervous. When Simon finds a dead parachutist atop the island which Sam and Eric saw and mistakenly believed was the beast he staggers down the island's mountain to tell the boys that the beast is not real. This is reminiscent of Christ staggering under the weight of his own cross.However Jack his men and even Ralph and Piggy are caught up in a festive tribal dance. When Simon appears he is mistaken for a beast and beaten to death. When this occurs wind causes the parachute atop the island to detach from the twigs which snagged it and the dead parachutist's body flies out to sea as Simon is dragged out to sea as well. This shows that Simon was and forever will be the only one of the boys to truly know where the beast was the entire time in their hearts.Roger an inimical character representing the embodiment of pure evil and sadism is the one who kills Piggy. He gets sadistic pleasure from torturing pigs and he enjoyably kicks down sand castles the littlun's build and throws stones at Henry. Roger is the personification of the base stage of the human psyche evil.Sam and Eric twins collectively known as Samneric represent society. They are naturally good and assist Ralph with collecting fruit and building huts. However Jack eventually captures them and they are forced to join his tribe. When Jack and his men hunt Ralph near the end of the film Samneric reluctantly give in and inform Jack of Ralph's hiding place showing that anarchy caused them to lose all sense of loyalty to others.Lord of the Flies is truly a masterpiece. It exemplifies Freudian thought observable human behavioral characteristics and the incontrovertible reality of the human psyche. The superego the part of our brain concerned only with our own survival can take over if rules are not existent. Society keeps humans sane and lack of civility will inevitably lead to savagery.Yes Lord of the Flies is a great adventure story but it is also the greatest representation of the human spirit ever created. Praise Golding for the invention and praise Brooks for his wonderful interpretation.".

	schema:reviewBody "I read the book when I was a kid and I found it to be very disturbing. I didn't really care to think why.Watching this movie as a grown up especially as a grown up trying to think about anything BUT work made me ponder several things about human behavior. For instance what makes one person lead and another follow? Why is there almost always just 2 prominent sides to a situation even though there are people involved whose opinions may be of varying shades of gray? Isn't it strange that once you commit an act of taboo that it just makes it so much easier to do the next time? Why is an act that is morally reprehensible to perform individually become so much easier when it is done in group? Where does one's individualism go when mob rule prevails ? I think the movie did a good job of bringing out the beast but it didn't surpass my initial impression from reading the book. The acting was commendable given the age and experience of the actors and the classic novel they were trying to portray. Ralph was just superb trying to lead with reason but watching his leadership ebb to a much more terrifying alter ego. The relentlessness and inevitability of his fate was captured in all its horror when he is told They're going to hurt you Ralph.Its hard to write a review about just the movie when the story itself as told in the book is what makes the biggest impression. The movie is rich in metaphors  innocence lost war society in general right and wrong etc. In closing I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for fear but not of the sensational variety that 'horror movies' are generally associated with. Its a black and white movie made in the 60's and stars a bunch of scrawny kids. The fear is what you have to not watch  but live.".

	schema:reviewBody "William Golding's timeless novel Lord of the Flies is one of the many works of literature that has continuously etched itself into the English reading curriculum much like Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird and William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Golding's novel isn't a racial parable or a story about starcrossed lovers but a dark biblical allegory with a message about as crippling and as thoughtprovoking as anyone I can think of. It's not an easy read with lots of imagery spelled out in grand detail and a plethora of ambiguous symbolism. And for that matter it's not a very easy watch. One must go in prepared and openminded to truly enjoy what Peter Brook's Lord of the Flies brings.The story is simple. After a horrific plane crash a group of young schoolboys are left stranded and illequipped to try and sustain themselves on a remote island surrounded by water as far as the eye can see. There are no adults the pilot is dead and their home country of England is now involved with what will be known as World War II. We are first greeted with plucky young Ralph Aubery who will later become selected leader of the island with his leadership resembling a fair and balanced democracy. Ralph's best friend on the island is a chubby boy named Piggy Edwards who remains realistic about the situation that the boys will be condemned to this island until they die.Another boy on the island named Jack Chapin quickly embraces life on the island and turns to barbaric and savage intentions as the antagonist whose only care is to hunt and kill. He becomes symbolic for Satan while another boy named Simon Gaman becomes almost a Christlike figure with his excessive assistance to the boys and authentic kind nature.The moral of the novel and film is quite interesting and is open for some heavy debate. Golding states that the only reason humans are kept in place and are civilized is because of law and order and if those laws were ever to be lifted at any given time that at first people would try to remain civil but would soon become virtually consumed by their savage instincts. We act on our superego meaning we do what we believe is right and if laws didn't exist we'd most likely act on our id our impulsive innerevil if you will. Over the course of the film it seems like in no time these once wellkept collective children are consumed by their own innerdesires to act on impulse and not fear any consequences at all. This makes for a very unsettling picture especially in the last halfhour when some unthinkable scenes occur.Hook's direction sets up a consistently tense and very detailed atmosphere. The cinematography is also commendable only complimented by the dreary silence because of the choice to omit any formal music. Hook manages to incorporate some rather tricky tracking shots and some birdseye shots that are difficult to successfully pull off. Apparently the film was shot on an island in Puerto Rico and very little scripting was done. Much of the dialog is improvised which works for and against the film simultaneously. There is a great feeling of authenticity when a film or show is improvised but here the children all of them I believe to be first time actors with some never even returning to film again recite their lines in a strange unnatural way which takes time to get used to. It provides inevitable corniness but thankfully can't derail the entire film all together.Not to mention the pacing feels a little off. Sometimes long periods of silence go on and we are unsure of where the film is going. Although a little odd it provides time for the cinematography and atmosphere to take effect projecting a feeling of dread and uncertainty. Throughout the film and the novel the boys are fearing what they call the beast which refers to the unknown on the island. The boys constantly believe some creature is out to get them and this fear consumes them much like their feelings of barbarism and savagery. This is where the film begins to hit home. What kid didn't dream of living by his own rules in a place where heshe could do and say whatever they wanted? It isn't until that dream becomes a reality do we begin to regret our wish. The true tragedy is these boys didn't wish for this.Lord of the Flies was a challenge to adapt to film and director Peter Brook clearly accepted it with gratitude and honor. He has great respect for Golding's original work keeping the biblical theology and references in place and rarely tampering the original events making this a successful adaptation. I still feel the need to reiterate the fact that the phrase the book is always better than the movie is a void statement seeing as the film adaptation can never be truly everything you wanted it to be. This is because the film is based off the director andor screenwriter's interpretation of the story. As far as that works Brook's is on par with mine but perhaps the more important question is is it on par with yours? Starring James Aubrey Tom Chapin Hugh Edwards and Tom Gaman. Directed by Peter Brook.".

	schema:reviewBody "...not because the book is so much better but rather because one always gets more out of a book than out of any movie rendition of it. The exception that proves the rule being One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nestnot better than the book but definitively it's equal. So I just watched the movie and cannot recommend it highly enough. Go into it with the question of what makes us human what civilization is and how we deal with our need for social living and then consider ALL sides of the matter before making a judgment.The movie making itself isn't all that perfect. But the way in which Brook present's the storyas a tableaux without a message leaving it for us to decidemore than redeems any inconsistencies in film technique or the acting.Someone above mentioned that it is hard to talk about the movie without talking about the story itself. And that is true. So that said I just wanted to comment that I'm disappointed in what seems to me to be a rather facile interpretation of Golding's work that seems prevalent amongst the commentsthe easy assignment of virtue to Ralph and Piggy and savagery to Jack and his followers. Commenters keep noting a reversion. The conch represents civilization and democracy Jack or more properly the boar's head totalitarianism and barbarism.But the question goes a bit deeper than that. Ralph starts off with the power and the trust. But his response to the situation the kids find themselves in is a passive onehe wants to build a fire and wait to be rescued. Jack is described as power hungry a number of times in comments but the readers fail to note that if not by show of hands the first time by show of feet the second time the kids withdraw the power from Ralphi.e. the scene in which he says what if I blow it and they don't come when Piggy tells him to summon the kids with the conch. And the ultimate question is not about whether Jack is power hungry and Ralph virtuous but rather why the children chose to follow Jack and not Ralph.THe answer is very clear. Jack was a stronger leader than Ralph. Ralph wanted to be rescuedJack sought to deal with the situation as it was. Materially Jack was able to provide meat to the kids because he was able to arm and discipline his choir boys. Socially Jack was able to forge a bond with his followers his tribe that gave them a reason to accept his leadership while Ralph could only offer leadership based on a momentary common consensus. And in the end Jack could protect his followers Ralph could not. It is significant that the two boys with Ralph in the scene mentioned above are Simon and Piggyin the end in allying themselves with him they end up dying while Roger the first to desert to Jack survives. To see Golding's story as a reversion to savagery misses I think the whole point. It was not a reversion the boys underwent but rather an adaptation to the circumstances in which they found themselves. They didn't go naked because they were suddenly nothing but monkeys they went naked because it was the better adaptation to the environment in which they found themselves. They didn't accept Jack because they had become uncivilized they accepted Jack because under the circumstances he offered more in terms of social utility than Ralph could. It is understanding this that we understand how totalitarian regimes do take powerthat people don't adopt them because they've reverted to savagery but rather that an extremity of circumstances compels certain behaviors in order to survive. Jack's power wouldn't have been possible without his choirboys armed with spears but neither would the meat he brought his tribe. The respective prime followers of Ralph and Jack Piggy and Roger are very interesting in that they represent the conflicting elements in human civilization that to protect the weak and that to hurt it. Intelligence is perceived as weak in a society on the edge because its rewards are not reaped immediately Raplh's glasses can start a fire but the kids are still at the mercy of someone seeing it while brute strength and violence does as in the killing of the pig reap immediate rewards. It concerns me that this novel is being taught improperly in schools as an allegory for good vs. evil rather than as testamentary to the human condition and the choices we make in order to survive. Golding's work is a brilliant examination not of human morality but of human society and its many layers and it is a shame to reduce to Ralph good Jack bad Manichean dichotomy.".

They nailed the characters of Ralph Jack Piggy and Simon dead on.

Yes the cast was talented in a nonprofessional way and that is perhaps what made the film work. But the real story of how the film was made is this Off set was very much like on set. We lived in an abandoned pineapple warehouse and all called each other by our movie names. There was a split in the cast  sort of one gang against another  although in the real life one Jack and Ralph were on the same side the leader of the other gang being one of the other choir boys. The gangs would make war on each other with Jack and Ralph's bunch headquartered out in the cane fields while the other bunch had a metal scaffold fort near the warehouse. In the beginning the cast was more of less evenly split but in the end I found I was on the losing side since we were down to only two people! So filming was not all that difficult for the kids and much of it was simply letting us go at it. For instance the hut building scene was turned into a contest of who could build the best hut with a watermelon being the prize. That the cameras were going was only a secondary concern for the kids.

	schema:reviewBody "It has been three years since I read the book and saw the movie and I have still not forgotten it. Lord of the Flies is one of the most harrowing film expiriences I have ever seen.You don't need Hannibal Lecter to make a movie scary and this movie proves it. Actually a film is most scary when it provokes fear on a most basic level. This is not a story that is scary because of plot twists or original characters. This film is scary because it uses techniques that will scare anyone in the deepest way.The plot is simple. School boys crash land on a remote island with no adults. The boys set up their own government with Ralph in charge. But things start to fall apart very quickly.The set up is perfect. All the boys are perfectly cast and their performances are strong all around. All the characters are likable in the beginning which is important because as Roger Ebert I think said a person is scarier when the viewer knows more about them.The directing is perfect.

	onyx:emotionText "It has been three years since I read the book and saw the movie and I have still not forgotten it. Lord of the Flies is one of the most harrowing film expiriences I have ever seen.You don't need Hannibal Lecter to make a movie scary and this movie proves it. Actually a film is most scary when it provokes fear on a most basic level. This is not a story that is scary because of plot twists or original characters. This film is scary because it uses techniques that will scare anyone in the deepest way.The plot is simple. School boys crash land on a remote island with no adults. The boys set up their own government with Ralph in charge. But things start to fall apart very quickly.The set up is perfect. All the boys are perfectly cast and their performances are strong all around. All the characters are likable in the beginning which is important because as Roger Ebert I think said a person is scarier when the viewer knows more about them.The directing is perfect. Even though the film is in black and white the imagery still retains a sense of wonder and awe. Each shot is perfectly used to create the optimum effect.

	schema:reviewBody "We open this classic 1963 adaptation of William Golding's novel with a series of photographs underneath the credits. A series of memories nicely setting the mood of the story  photographs of boy's schools of the situation at hand in the story and of plane crashes disaster. We get though sometimes unclearly that a plane has crashed during a war and that there are presumably boys on board.With that note the story becomes suddenly detached. The first acting scene starts with the British boys we inferred before yet they are completely clean and perfectly calm and nothing can be seen of the fact that they've just survived a near brush with death. We see nothing of the remains of the plane we see nothing of the scar that was referenced in the book  we have no idea if these boys are simply on a field trip. A key point for continuity  the tube escape system hinted at in the book a possibility that the boys might have escaped in their condition. It was supposed to be technology but we never find out about it  that key point was missed.So we start off with a break. Coming in to the movie the first thing you'd notice is a horrible lack of pacing. When dialogue occurs there are harsh pauses in between camera focuses on each character. Piggy speaks horribly slowly  although that could be attributed as a part of character  and the other characters seem perfectly sedate. It seems that they're simply waiting for a teacher to arrive. No sense of emotion nothing.Progressing through the normal parts of the book the dialogue and action is extremely slow. The camera would focus in on Ralph for a second wait....then he'd say his line. This rough pacing brought down the entire feel of the movie.Granted it was made in 1963. It is a black and white movie and uses a different kind of cinematography we are used to today. But that is not apparent in movies made earlier in black and white  Hitchcock movies are paced amazingly. This is not an example of a good use of the technology available.But there were naturally certain redeeming points. The bloodlust in eating the first pig is pictured well and the second half of the movie is much better and easier to watch. There is a genuine frisson of tension while Ralph is being chased  although a flash or a glimpse of a possible attacher would make it more so  and the music and sound effects are used amazingly well although there is one point on the top of the mountain when one line of music repeats over and over monotonously.The main problem aside from the pacing must have been the lack of a clear point to the tale  in the novel there was a societal critique and a perfect image of one's inner demons. In this movie  it lacks.Rating 610".

	schema:reviewBody "William Golding's 1954 novel Lord of the Flies has gone down as one of the most widelyread and acclaimed books of the 20th Century and beyond thanks to the author's melding of solid though deceptively straight forward storytelling with allegory making it an excellent tool to introduce various literary devices to students hence why it is usually a staple of high school and college English curriculum. TIME Magazine even included it on their list of the 100 Best EnglishLanguage Novels written between 1923 and 2005. The novel itself can be enjoyed on many fronts. If nothing else it's a fascinating premise What WOULD a bunch of young boys do if stranded somewhere with no adults around no rules no laws no structure or discipline and left to their own devices? The fact it also happens to rich as an allegory on human nature and societal structure is just the icing on top. Golding himself summed up his intent rather simply by stating it's ... about the problem of evil and the problem of how people are to live together in society. That basic concept is put front and center in director Peter Brook's film adaptation and relayed with power despite some obvious technical issues that arise.An airplane full of young British schoolboys  ranging from about 6 years old to early teens  crashes somewhere on an uninhabited island. Ralph James Aubrey the son of a Navy commander who thinks the paternal figure he idolizes will soon come find them stumbles upon the chubby insecure bespectacled talkative Piggy Hugh Edwards first and the two make their way down the beach discovering more of their schoolmates as they go. Along the beach come a second and smaller group of slightly older boys led by Jack Tom Chapin. Things begin harmlessly enough with the kids essentially viewing the experience as some extended camping trip. They play games laugh play pranks gather fruit start a fire and build a shelter from branches as they await rescue. Using a majority rules vote to establish a new leader in Ralph the group set down a few basic ground rules at the outset to maintain order like using a conch shell as a platform to speak without interruption and keeping a fire going at the island's highest peak so a passing aircraft may see it but things quickly go to hell.Once one of the boys claims to see a snakelike shapeshifting beast stirring among the bushes at night which later turns into a mythical sea beast a seed of superstition and paranoia encroaches on the new society and things escalate from there. Jack and his group deem themselves the hunters sharpen spears paint their faces dress in animal rags leave pig heads on stakes as an offering to their perceived new God and quickly descend into a life of violent tribal savagery while Ralph loses his power and his numbers once his rival proves he can provide better and has no issue using deadly force as a means to silence those who oppose the new way. After having swayed the majority of others over to his side Jack and his few remaining allies realize their own lives are in grave danger.Filmed in 1961 in Puerto Rico this low budget production had numerous technical issues that needed tended to before it could finally be released in 1963. The major problem was the audio most of which was not actually recorded on location due to various natural noises the filmmakers really couldn't do anything about. As a result most of the dialogue was dubbed in later and sadly they didn't do a very good job of it. Audio levels really seem off throughout. Many seem to have issues with the casting of inexperienced boys instead of trained child actors in all of the roles which results in some wooden amateurish and  or stilted dialogue readings. Personally it didn't bother me all that much but it will some viewers. If you can ignore the above issues this is a visually splendid film that's atmospherically photographed on beautiful locations and it manages to generate a great desolate feel apart from the 'civilized' world.Most importantly of all Brook actually does the source novel justice. Very little of importance was left out and the director conveys exactly what the book is trying to say. That's especially impressive considering he had to narrow down around 60 hours ! of total filmed footage to just 90 minutes for the theatrical release. Supposedly a 100minute version was initially released to Cannes but I don't believe that cut has ever been made commercially available. A more polished and bigger budgeted color remake was made in 1990 by director Harry Hook. Though it's not a terrible movie it lacks the character and artistry of this original version.".

And there's no compromise on that constrained only by the sensibilities of British audiences of the time.So we have episodes only.

The message a real one is about the use of abstraction in understanding how we use abstraction to aggregate civilly. Austentype introspectives Golding and Brook all do this in different ways so the joy in this project is in seeing how they overlay.Pay attention to the way we are implied. Everything that is there is obviously arranged so that our eye can catch all the important elements.

It was a very attention drawing story with vivid imagery a compelling descent into savage behavior with a strong lesson about values and ethics. I highly recommend the book to anyone.But here an immortal story has amazingly enough been made into a bad movie. It's as simple as that. I don't know about the simple movie viewer but if you had just read the book as I had watching the movie would be complete torture.The book had eerie colorful imagery that pulled in readers and compelling and disturbing scenes. Naturally a movie adaption of a story on such an island in such a remote place begs for color and visual moods. However this movie was filmed in black and white which considerably dulls the intended atmosphere in several scenes. Too bad the '90s remake of Lord of the Flies completely sucked. It would have been a chance to make up for this flaw.The scenes are very poorly organized. Any tension suspense or compelling nature is lost because the screenplay and shots just don't flow well and the camera work is amateur and quite sloppy.And what really both amused and irritated me about this movie is the laughably poor acting from an inexperienced child cast. Yes it's true that they're only children but there were and are films with good kid actors that could convincingly do character roles. The kids in this film are just embarrassing. They all sound like they're struggling to remember their lines or are trying to follow character directions but not quite knowing what to do. The cast is completely unconvincing and their performance contributes greatly into making this the bad movie that it is though it's not completely their fault as the direction and technical work is every bit as shameful and amateur and besides the child cast from the '90s remake was every bit as horrible if not worse. By the way you'll notice that the voices of some of the older kid actors change tone getting deeper and higher pitched in alternate scenes this is particularly noticeable with Ralph. Yet another sign of poor organization and little thought into this movie.Overall a lousy film but definitely the right choice between the '60s and '90s version. If you're going to watch a movie adaption of William Golding's literary classic this is the right version to watch as the '90s version is even worse but the best choice would be to skip the movies altogether and just read the book. Go to your local bookstore get the novel turn to page one and get ready for one amazing trip.".

	schema:headline " A different take on a highly analyzed story";
	schema:reviewBody "I would like to offer a different take on how this film should be seen. Most people see Lord of the Flies as a film about the descent of a group of schoolboys into savagery.  I see it as a story about the collapse of democracy and the rise of totalitarism.Allow me to elaborate on that one.  William Golding wrote his novel in the years following World War 2.  Golding had observed to his dismay the collapse of German democracy and the rise of Hitler's Nazi regime. Democracy failed in Germany primarily because the German people wanted it to.  Hitler then proceeded to crush all opposition and remilitarize Germany much like Jack seduced the schoolboys to join him and  hunt down Ralph after Ralph had been fairly elected.  Similarly in the USSR Stalin came to power and hunted down Trotsky and all his dissenters.  In book and film Ralph becomes a heroic Trotskyist figure who opposes Jack and his brutal Stalinists.Both book and film provide a disturbing look at the triumph of totalitarism.

	schema:headline " Not a bad adaptation but it doesn't have as much of a bite as it should";
	schema:reviewBody "Lord of the Flies a piece of literature written by William Golding and originally published in 1954 is still a very famous novel and is often studied in schools many can say that's where they became familiar with it. Nearly a decade later the first movie adaptation of the book saw the light of day. Adaptations of novels can be excellent while others may generally be disappointing. This 1963 adaptation of William Golding's famous novel turned out to be sort of a mixed blessing.A large group of English schoolboys find themselves stranded after a plane crash without any surviving adults. Shortly after the crash two of them meet for the first time. One of them is Ralph and the other's real name remains unknown. The other boy tells Ralph about his undesired nickname Piggy and unfortunately that is what he is called from then on. Ralph and Piggy don't see any other boys around so Ralph uses a shell or a conch to call them. With all the boys gathered Ralph is elected as the leader for the time they are stranded and it is soon discovered that they are on an island. Ralph tries his best to keep the rest of the boys civilized and tells them that a smoke signal must be kept going in order for them to be rescued. However a rivalry soon begins between Ralph and the powerhungry Jack and many boys end up on Jack's side creating a group of savages! The first thing you may be wondering about this movie is how faithful to the novel it is. Quite a bit of detail from the story was removed for this movie which often happens with adaptations of novels so if you've read the book remembering some parts that you found really interesting and you'd like to see how they're done in this movie you may be disappointed to see that some of them are not included. However apart from that I would say the movie tells the original story very well but it definitely has some other problems. The cinematography is pretty amateurish and the cast is well not terrible but not great. Personally I found some of the movie dull so I had trouble getting into it at times but also found certain parts interesting or somewhat moving though not as much so as I was expecting.This Lord of the Flies adaptation definitely hasn't impressed every admirer of the book which I can understand. I was a tad disappointed myself certainly not as much as some people but still a tad disappointed. However many other admirers of William Golding's piece of literature like this movie. For fans of the book who haven't seen this movie if you want an adaptation that is faithful to the book despite the unsurprising fact that the story is shortened and you can get over the shortcomings I've mentioned I recommend this movie. You just might not want to expect a work of genius.".

Now I love the Truman Show too very much and I'll admit that I was was very uninterested in ever seeing a copycat version of it. It was until just a few weeks ago that I actually watched Edtv even with the expectation that I would most likely not like it too much and I must say I was pleasantly surprised!Not only was Edtv funny and entertaining but it was nearly nothing at all like the Truman Show. I mean the ONLY similarity is the idea of a live TV show about an ordinary guy. But Truman didn't even know he was on TV. He was just living what he thought was an ordinary life. All the cameras and microphones were completely hidden and he lived in a town that was entirely fabricated from his wife and lifelong best friend to the rain and even the sun. His is a story of a man searching for an escape from his everyday life which little by little he is realizing may not be what it seems. Ed on the other hand was a nobody who was chosen to have a camera crew actually follow him around all day while he went on about his life. His life and in turn the show became more about instant celebrity as viewers became enchanted in watching this loser become a megastar over night. People flocked around him just as much to meet him as to be on TV themselves and he endured some major struggles in keeping his life and relationships normal which was impossible with his celebrity status and oncamera life.Both movies had a theme of America's fixation with TV and more specifically Reality TV but have different plots and overall themes altogether. I think Edtv was a very enjoyable movie and Mathew McConaughey and Jenna Elfman delivered fantastic performances. Not to mention the mind boggling and I think underrated job of editing such an enormous amount of footage. Considering that while the film cameras were rolling the video cameras were rolling too and just about all of the video footage you see was actually shot when you see it being shot I think that Ron Howard did a great job of keeping track of it all and actually making it work. So when someone says Well it was no Truman Show they are absolutely right. I  think it is a great movie that stands on it's own and should stand proud.".

Ed slightly reluctant at first soon becomes seduced by this idea an idea which turns sour.Ron Howards movie does have a lot to say about the issues of celebrity  reality TV but at its heart is a great romantic comedy which has more of an edge to it than is expected from the one time star of Happy Days. The pairing of Matthew McConaughey  Woody Harrelson is inspired they are great together sparking off one another. Natural comedic actors you believe they are brothers. Dennis Hopper puts in a good cameo  Jenny Elfman is totally convincing as the female romantic lead. You really care about the plight of the characters  the rest of the cast are also on top form. From Rob Reiners small role as a TV executive to the excellent Martin Landau as Eds father. He is one of the best character actors of recent years making truly varied  believable performance in films as diverse as Crimes  Misdemeanors Ed Wood  Rounders. Add Edtv to the list   his performance is comedy gold!The great acting would of course all be in vain if it weren't coupled with a good script. Thankfully Edtv has one. All the predictable hallmarks of a romantic comedy are here but with a sharper wit  of course the reality show structure which brings a new dimension to the genre. Add to this Howards direction using all the tricks styles  conventions of reality TV. Sometimes you are watching the cameramens POV sometimes Eds exploits are conveyed on a TV screen complete with advertising at other times you are presented with multiple viewpoints of the same scene. These constant variations in style keep the film fresh  interesting  are further enhanced by the audience reactions throughout the film  the TV led critique  discussions about the merits or otherwise of the phenomenon that is Edtv. Together the acting directing  script really convince that Edtv is viable  could exist!Overall this is a funny well directed romantic comedy from Ron Howard. Great performances abound from all concerned. There is a deeper level to the film which isn't hammered home or done in a heavy handed way but is there none the less among the laughs. But just how long will it be before Edtv becomes a reality?".

EDtv is a fairly black comedy a satire on modern TV culture.The producers of a failing TV network decide to take a punt and try a new format  a real TV doco on an ordinary life.They audition and choose Ed Mathew McConaghey a rangy slobbish video store worker who's been once or twice bitten in love the sort of fellow who goes out with a beer mug tied around his neck.Ed takes on the challenge partly because he's pretty broke and partly because he's bored urged on by his little hoper small brained big muscled brother Ray played by Woody Harrelson. A few days into the shoot Ray throws over his girlfriend Shari Jenna Elfman and Ed wins her as his new lover. Ratings soar!The talent of the cast not to mention it's director Ron Howard lends a great deal of life to Edtv. It's often genuinely funny. McConaughey uses that winning smile to perfection even as he has an early morning half asleep  fiddle with his genitals. McConaughey is a major reason why EDtv works as well as it does.Woody Harrelson is a genuinely talented actor and can play a spoilt selfish meat headed brother perfectly. Some of the best lines have been left to Al the boy's father played by Martin Landau as well as to Ellen DeGeneres as the show's producer.But it's the character of Ed and his family who really set the neurones firing. Unlike many American films these heroes are ordinary middle Americans probably about as close as a mainstream American film could get to an English Ken LoachMike Leach style of middleworking class family. There aren't any chandeliers in Edtv.It's not often that these sorts of characters are treated warmly in these sorts of films and then we must ask how our own families would fare under this sort of warts and all scrutiny probably about as well as Ed's.And it's also interesting to wonder how much the average Aussie would consider EDtv to be a satire given the popularity of Rikki Lake and her ilk not to mention the Funniest Home Video types of programs. Is real life TV is there such a thing already even more outrageous than EDtv? Is EDtv outrageous enough to be satire?There are some dull minutes in EDtv mostly to do with Elizabeth Hurley's appearance as a sex pot but EDtv proves again that Hollywood isn't nearly as dumb as it makes out to be.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I review a film I like to try and elaborate on its good and bad points however in the case of EdTv there aren't many good points to speak of. Ron Howard's film is cliched from beginning to end. There is not one surprising element and the characters are quite dull with the exception of Ed's brother Ray Woody Harrelson who is at moments quite funny. Mattew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson look like they could actually be brothers but McConaughey's performance is just plain dull. And speak of dull people call this a hilarious comedy. It had a couple of funny moments but it definitely wasn't hilarious. As well Dennis Hopper had a throw away performance as Ed's real father. Why bother getting a brilliant actor such as Hopper for a role like this?EdTv had a couple of minor elements that were somewhat good. First of all Ron Howard captures quite well the fascination that people have with seeing themselves on TV. Second he repeatedly shows images on television some in extreme close up uncovering the individual pixels that make up an image giving the viewer the feeling of the 'artificial'. TV is an artificial means to anyone's existence whether you're on TV or just watching it.The real problem with EdTv is its failure to take into account the fact that people act differently when they know they are being filmed.  The concept of EdTv is to get into the real life of an average every man by having a volunteer allow a camera crew film every aspect of their life on live TV for two months. But the truth is people no matter what setting they are in respond differently to a camera than to other people. We are lead to believe that this is Ed's real life. Well it isn't! Early on in the film Ellen DeGeneres's character says that if you drive by an accident you can't help but look to see if there is that rolling head on the highway. At first I hated this line because its so cliched in itself I can remember having heard this line when I was eight or ten. It is however true people do look and have that desire to look but something such as an accident is a random and extreme event. These events are what people are interested in seeing. EdTv tries to develop a theme around people's desires to watch but fails miserably. Psychoanalytic film theory has emphasized the importance of the 'look' or the gaze of the audience. This is reflected in its references to the audience as 'the spectator'. 'Looking' is part of an individual's selfdefinition and relationship to his or her environment. Freudian theory describes the position of the 'spectator' as that of a voyeur who makes an object of those caught unwittingly in the power of his gaze. The voyeuristic look is one of the pleasures an audience finds in the cinema. One of the real pleasures of 'looking' is the power you feel in knowing that the person who is the subject of your gaze doesn't know that you are looking. EdTv doesn't even consider this as an option even though it hinted towards it at the beginning. Films such as Blue Velvet and even Sliver capture the idea that people want to see what others are doing without them knowing they are being watched.I think that EdTv would have been much more interesting if it had considered some of these possibilities. If what occurs in EdTv  were to actually ever happen I don't think it would be much of a success. I personally couldn't care a less about some program with a guy knowingly putting on a show for us. Perhaps if you could get into his life and videotape him without his knowing it it might be interesting. I know this is a scary idea and most people would not want to admit this about themselves but more people would watch if the person being filmed had no clue because that gives us the audience the power.12 out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "EdTV is Hollywood's remake of the 1994 FrenchCanadian hit Louis 19 le roi des ondes. I'm not going to compare the two films. The only reason I mentioned it is to set the record straight that EdTV 1999 is NOT a ripoff of The Truman Show 1998 since the screenplay was bought years earlier.EdTV is a somewhat Orwellian comedydrama about an everyman named Ed who falls victim to society's hitech voyeurism. Ed becomes the pawn of a bunch of network suits who broadcast and do their best to ruin his entire life to the thrill of millions of viewers. I think it would've worked better as a noholdsbarred satire like the movies LIVE ROBOCOP AMERICAN DREAMZ or the masterpiece BRAZIL but director Ron Howard opts to take the kinder gentler approach which ends up watering down the message  its impact on us.Not only that but today the story isn't as edgy as it might have been back in the 90s when reality TV was just budding and we didn't know where it would lead. Today's audiences might think what's the big deal? and to be honest I found myself thinking that a few times during the picture. But I do remember the 90s and the whole realityTV phobia which fueled such stories as this and that's what made it an entertaining film for me. If you remember the 90s and your first reactions to the new phenomenon called reality TV you might enjoy it too.At times the film teases us with challenging philosophies in particular there's the intriguing line Ed is the apotheosis of a prevailing American syndrome. It used to be that people were famous for being special. Now they're considered special merely for being famous. Fame has become a moral good in this country It's its own virtue Unfortunately the film never follows up on such thoughts and instead runs back to predictable drama such as the girlfriend who can't deal with cameras invading her life or the clich about Ed being hounded by brainless fans all the time. These plot devices undermine the power of a film like this reducing the film to passing entertainment instead of something more thoughtprovoking.The whole film struck me as being a very Ron Howard production which means a shiny polished presentation and a predictable Disneylike story with no real surprises or tension. It dazzles us with a great starstudded cast and a lot of gloss the budget was an estimated 60 million... five times as much as 1999's Academy Award winner American Beauty. But I was much more impressed with the relatively obscure films LIVE a satire about a reality show where the contestants play Russian roulette CASI DIVAS a great Mexican comedysatire about a nationwide search for new talent and an unknown comedy gem called SPECIAL about an ordinary chump who takes an experimental drug and becomes... uh... special. These 3 films deliver entertainment but more importantly they carry a lot of weight behind what they're telling us. EdTV had a few noteworthy scenes such as the funeral confrontation between the two brothers but these scenes were deleted from the final release and can only be seen on the DVD extras. The result is a somewhat breezy and entertaining but unimportant film.EdTV is worth the price of admission and it kept me entertained from start to finish. But if you want a little more substance to feed your brain try to check out the other films I mentioned above.".

Ed becomes the pawn of a bunch of network suits who broadcast and do their best to ruin his entire life to the thrill of millions of viewers. I think it would've worked better as a noholdsbarred satire like the movies LIVE ROBOCOP AMERICAN DREAMZ or the masterpiece BRAZIL but director Ron Howard opts to take the kinder gentler approach which ends up watering down the message  its impact on us.Not only that but today the story isn't as edgy as it might have been back in the 90s when reality TV was just budding and we didn't know where it would lead. Today's audiences might think what's the big deal? and to be honest I found myself thinking that a few times during the picture. But I do remember the 90s and the whole realityTV phobia which fueled such stories as this and that's what made it an entertaining film for me. If you remember the 90s and your first reactions to the new phenomenon called reality TV you might enjoy it too.At times the film teases us with challenging philosophies in particular there's the intriguing line Ed is the apotheosis of a prevailing American syndrome. It used to be that people were famous for being special. Now they're considered special merely for being famous. Fame has become a moral good in this country It's its own virtue Unfortunately the film never follows up on such thoughts and instead runs back to predictable drama such as the girlfriend who can't deal with cameras invading her life or the clich about Ed being hounded by brainless fans all the time. These plot devices undermine the power of a film like this reducing the film to passing entertainment instead of something more thoughtprovoking.The whole film struck me as being a very Ron Howard production which means a shiny polished presentation and a predictable Disneylike story with no real surprises or tension. It dazzles us with a great starstudded cast and a lot of gloss the budget was an estimated 60 million... five times as much as 1999's Academy Award winner American Beauty. But I was much more impressed with the relatively obscure films LIVE a satire about a reality show where the contestants play Russian roulette CASI DIVAS a great Mexican comedysatire about a nationwide search for new talent and an unknown comedy gem called SPECIAL about an ordinary chump who takes an experimental drug and becomes... uh... special. These 3 films deliver entertainment but more importantly they carry a lot of weight behind what they're telling us. EdTV had a few noteworthy scenes such as the funeral confrontation between the two brothers but these scenes were deleted from the final release and can only be seen on the DVD extras. The result is a somewhat breezy and entertaining but unimportant film.EdTV is worth the price of admission and it kept me entertained from start to finish. But if you want a little more substance to feed your brain try to check out the other films I mentioned above.";

	schema:reviewBody "It's a bit of a shame that EdTV is always compared to The Truman Show because it's really not a ripoff just a lighter treatment of similar subject matter. With the rise of reality TV in the late 90's loss of personal privacy was a hot subject and so it's quite legitimate for more then one movie to be made about it and both movies treat the subject differently Truman with a more philosophical angle and EdTV with a social one and with a more comedic direction. And the story does bring its own message one that's poignant and clear and aged well over the last decade of realityreign.Unfortunately  none of that helps the fact that the movie just isn't very good. Ron Howard's directorial work as it always is is professional but hollow using every trick of the trade ably and without soul. He can make it slide though or could have if the script would have been better. The dialog may have been written specifically to sound everyday and authentic but a lot of the lines would have sounded unrealistic if spoken on Big Brother. As for the acting  the horrible Matthew McConaughey actually pulls off a betterthanaverage performance for his abilities but it's not enough to pull it together Woody Harrelson is mediocre at best much worse yet are two mediocre TV actresses  Jenna Elfman and Ellen DeGeneres  who told Ellen she could act?  who really fall short with very flat characters and very unconvincing deliveries. Some quality supporting actors  Martin Landau Dennis Hopper and Rob Reiner in a terrific performance  and some nice cameos from Jay Leno Bill Maher Michael Moore and other prominent media men of the time help it along but it's not enough.So for the story alone it's worth a watch and it makes some pretty interesting points about the role of the media in demolishing personal freedoms and it's quite amazing that it was made before the Bush administration because some direct connections could easily be made and it's often enjoyable but while The Truman Show and Pleasantville may be remembered for many years to come EdTV is ultimately as forgettable as any middleoftheroad American comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Concursante is the most brilliant thoughtprovoking and intelligent movie I've seen this year and I recommend it to any moviewatcher who has an open mind to new storytelling ways in cinema and to an out of the ordinary and ferociously critical content. It is basically an intellectual bomb aimed at the modern economy system based on fictitious money and on bank credits mortgages and loans that ends up devouring the individual his properties his dignity and eventually his life.The movie follows Martn Circo not by chance it means circus in Spanish since that is exactly what we're about to watch an Economy teacher who doesn't sidestep the traditional scholarship when he lectures his students according to him we live in the best world possible. One day he wins material goods worth 6 million euros on a television contest he and his girlfriend are now filthy rich. But Circo is about to find out that being a millionaire is very expensive and that he has now become a victim of the bank system. The movie starts a la Sunset Blvd. with Circo witnessing his own death scene no spoilers therefore and telling us his story of rise and fall. But even though we know or we think we know how the story goes there is much more to it than the story of an ordinary man versus the bank. In the wake of his gradual fall he and the viewers will meet several picturesque characters with the outlandish and rebellious economy expert Edmundo Figueroa clearly standing out and forming a memorable antiheroic pair with Circo.There are many reasons why it is advisable to watch Concursante. It will tell you or remind you of a few uncomfortable truths that we live with every day but which we accept for the sake of being able to buy the newest cell phone model and yet it will do so in a nonlecturing way. It is brimming with cynicism irony and some degree of accepted fatalism as to the world we live in this could as well have been a rampant tragedy but the director has wisely chosen to make it a surreal comedy of sorts despite its heavy critical content.".

It is basically an intellectual bomb aimed at the modern economy system based on fictitious money and on bank credits mortgages and loans that ends up devouring the individual his properties his dignity and eventually his life.The movie follows Martn Circo not by chance it means circus in Spanish since that is exactly what we're about to watch an Economy teacher who doesn't sidestep the traditional scholarship when he lectures his students according to him we live in the best world possible. One day he wins material goods worth 6 million euros on a television contest he and his girlfriend are now filthy rich. But Circo is about to find out that being a millionaire is very expensive and that he has now become a victim of the bank system. The movie starts a la Sunset Blvd. with Circo witnessing his own death scene no spoilers therefore and telling us his story of rise and fall. But even though we know or we think we know how the story goes there is much more to it than the story of an ordinary man versus the bank. In the wake of his gradual fall he and the viewers will meet several picturesque characters with the outlandish and rebellious economy expert Edmundo Figueroa clearly standing out and forming a memorable antiheroic pair with Circo.There are many reasons why it is advisable to watch Concursante. It will tell you or remind you of a few uncomfortable truths that we live with every day but which we accept for the sake of being able to buy the newest cell phone model and yet it will do so in a nonlecturing way. It is brimming with cynicism irony and some degree of accepted fatalism as to the world we live in this could as well have been a rampant tragedy but the director has wisely chosen to make it a surreal comedy of sorts despite its heavy critical content.";

	schema:reviewBody "In his films about morality and the church such as Viridiana director Luis Bunuel has attacked the selfdeception of those whose pure Christianity comes into conflict with the demands of society. In the masterful 1958 film Nazarin Father Nazario Francisco Rabal a Catholic Priest tries to imitate Christ by living a life of selfdenial. He surrounds himself with prostitutes beggars thieves and dwarfs and freely shares his meager resources with others but finds that his actions only produce distressing results. Based on the novel by Benito Perez Galdos the film is about a gentle but sanctimonious priest in rural Mexico in 1900.Naively unconcerned with his own best interests he provides refuge to Andara Rita Macedo a prostitute who has just killed another street girl in a knife fight. When he also befriends Andara's sister Beatriz Marga Lopez suspicions arise among his superiors about his behavior. Forced to leave the church he remains steadfast in his beliefs going on the road dressed as a peasant and begging for alms. The sister's soon join him as disciples in his saintly pilgrimage after a dying girl regains her health as a result of his prayers. Nazarin's best intentions prove fruitless however. He agrees to work on a road crew for food but in so doing creates a labor dispute that leads to violence. His guidance is again rejected when he volunteers to help a woman dying of the plague asking her to picture what Heaven looks like. In spite of the priest's equation of sexual desire with sin all she wants is one more visit from her husband and lover. Arrested and thrown into prison with Andara Nazarin's life becomes more and more Christlike in its agony. He is beaten by a thug and begins to question his faith when he is unable to forgive his assailant. Is Father Nazario an impractical fool trying to live by unrealistic ideals or is he a modernday Christ sentenced by a soulless world to endure a similar fate? Bunuel sends us mixed messages. He attacks the hypocrisy of the church for not living up to the teachings of Christ and seems to admire the priest for his rebellion against accepted social norms. Yet ultimately Nazario is just a sad and forlorn human being. Condemned by the church as a nonconforming rebel scorned by a society that does not understand his passion he carries his crown of thorns to an uncertain end perhaps realizing at last that his selfsatisfied idealism did not include understanding the true nature of his humanity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nazarin directed by Luis Bunuel presents an extraordinary view of religion in Mexico. As written by the director and Julio Alejandro his notable collaborator this was a film that put Mexican cinema in the international map after receiving the Grand Prix in Cannes that year. It's a disturbing film because Mr. Bunuel delves deep into what's wrong with the church.Nazarin by all reckoning is a saint. This young priest is seen living a life of poverty in a seedy pension of a city. He doesn't have enough for himself but he doesn't mind parting with a coin when a beggar appears by his window asking for help. At the same time he takes into his small room a prostitute that has been hurt in a fight with another woman. Andara the woman repays his kindness by burning the room and the whole building!

It's ironic how Spain welcomed him after this film was released because they saw it as showing Christian qualities when in reality this is an acerbic satire on the catholic church and its ministers.Francisco Rabal the Spanish actor makes a wonderful Nazarin. This was one of his best roles. Mr. Rabal worked extensively in his native country but also in Mexico and Argentina. Rita Macedo as Andara is also excellent.

	onyx:emotionText "Nazarin directed by Luis Bunuel presents an extraordinary view of religion in Mexico. As written by the director and Julio Alejandro his notable collaborator this was a film that put Mexican cinema in the international map after receiving the Grand Prix in Cannes that year. It's a disturbing film because Mr. Bunuel delves deep into what's wrong with the church.Nazarin by all reckoning is a saint. This young priest is seen living a life of poverty in a seedy pension of a city. He doesn't have enough for himself but he doesn't mind parting with a coin when a beggar appears by his window asking for help. At the same time he takes into his small room a prostitute that has been hurt in a fight with another woman. Andara the woman repays his kindness by burning the room and the whole building! Nazarin is seen taking to the countryside begging for food. Andara and Beatriz two prostitutes from his old town follow him. Nazarin's life parallels that of Jesus.

Other earlier works like The Forgotten Ones about juvenile delinquents from a marginal neighborhood in Mexico are more serious and provide a strong social message.However I believe it is Nazarin which most successfully shoots for the heart of the viewer. While it's true that it's brimming with irony it nevertheless reveals an aspect of Buuel which would appear to be intrigued by the beauty and solemnity of the spiritual quest. Here while the director quite typically throws countless jabs at the Catholic Church he also appears to show surprisingly a sense of admiration for genuine Christian thought and its practice of selfless love.What?? Luis Buuel unabashedly praising a Jesuslike figure?? I always thought of him as a completely cynical artist without a trace of faith in human virtue... that is until I watched Nazarin. My appreciation is that he satirically exposes the difficulty of following Christ's example in a society infested with meanness ignorance and sin but he also presents the hero Father Nazario as quite the beacon of light amidst a sea of darkness. Without a doubt by the end of the film I was looking up to him and not down on him! Some would argue that Father Nazario's doubts regarding his faith point to the loss of his saintly values. Alas if he can't do good in this world who can? But I would say that this flaw his frustration precisely makes his character all the more heroic because it shows how human he is and how challenging his struggle within must be. And who says the priest couldn't eventually emerge from that dark night and regain his confidence? Perhaps we've only been presented with a difficult part of his spiritual journey. The elegant open ending allows us to imagine ourselves what the final outcome of the story might be like.I recognize in Buuel the aggressive selfprofessed atheist endowed with brilliant wit and social awareness but after having watched Nazarin I also sense from him a certain warmth a depth and maturity that's not so evident in his other work.For the sake of contrast I strongly recommend watching afterward his short film Simon of the Desert also made in Mexico several years later. It deals with a similar subject matter  the surrender of the ego in the face of temptation  only it does so in a hysterically funny and totally irreverent style.".

This story Nazarin was written by Spain's greatest writer besides Miguel de CervantesDon Quijote de la Mancha. The story in itself is superb Nazarin a priest that lives by his beliefs tries to live a very Christian life but as always there are people that do not accept this. He wanders through many places preaching his Christianity but finding most of the time people that do not accept him.

As an output from his Mexican era of film making it was an invaluable talent to possess with little money and extremely tight schedules. Nazarin however surpasses many of Bunuel's previous Mexican films in terms of the acting Francisco Rabal is excellent narrative and theme.The theme interestingly is something that was explored again in Viridiana made three years later in Spain. It concerns the individual's struggle for humanity and altruism amongst a society that rejects any notion of virtue. Father Nazarin however is portrayed more sympathetically than Sister Viridiana. Whereas the latter seems to choose charity because she wishes to atone for her perceived sins Nazarin's whole existence and reason for being seems to be to help others whether they or we like it or not. The film's last scenes in which he casts doubt on his behaviour and in a split second has to choose between the life he has been leading or the conventional life that is expected of a priest are so emotional because they concern his moral integrity and we are never quite sure whether it remains intact or not.This is a remarkable film and I would urge anyone interested in classic cinema to seek it out. It is one of Bunuel's most moving films and encapsulates many of his obsessions frustrated desire mad love religious hypocrisy etc. In my view 'Nazarin' is second only to 'The Exterminating Angel' in terms of his Mexican movies and is certainly near the top of the list of Bunuel's total filmic output.".

There he had to deal with very cheap budgets and work in an industry interested mainly in churning commercial movies to unsophisticated audiences yet he somehow managed to make interesting thought provoking movies that have stand the test of time. This movie is based on a novel by Spanish author Benito Perez Galdos  and the adaptation is quite faithful even if the setting is now early 20th century Mexico instead of early 20th century Spain. The protagonist Nazarin is a priest who tries to live a life that is as faithful as it can be to the one prescribed by Christ. The question many would ask is whether such endeavor would be possible without incurring in the hostility incomprehension and mockery of your fellow human beings. As it happens he suffers a lot of indignities yet he remains stubborn until the controversial final shot to this objective. I think Buuel wanted to show Nazarin as a somewhat ridiculous figure but perhaps inadvertently his stubbornness at least to this viewer comes out as admirable. In any case a great film.".

My first experience with him was The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeosie often considered his greatest work with which I became so frustrated and bored that I eventually shut the tape off. Likewise Belle de Jour which is almost certainly his best known film and also generally considered one of his many masterpieces didn't interest me very much at all. I didn't hate it like I did Discreet but I didn't like it. Third I saw L'Age d'Or. Finally I had gotten somewhere. Fourth Los Olvidados also good. Still neither L'Age d'Or nor Los Olvidados blew me away. Great films but not masterpieces.Nazarin is my fifth Bunuel and I like it just a tad more than those other two. It is about a priest from Spain now in Mexico who refuses to live in the kind of luxury most priests live in. He wants to be more like Jesus leading the meekest life possible. He's also willing to forgive everyone for anything and to suffer without protest. I'm pretty sure Bunuel does not sympathize with the character and sees him as rather selfrighteous. However I only assume that because of my knowledge of the director whose most famous quotation is Thank God I'm still an atheist which he apparently said in an interview over this very film I get this information from John Baxter's book about Bunuel if you're interested. The interviewer who dragged those words from Bunuel's mouth must have been himself confused about Nazarin. One who was more predisposed to believe in religious conviction who also knows nothing about Bunuel might see the priest as a heroic figure. This is especially true if that viewer has hisher own criticisms of organized religion. The priest may be somewhat selfrighteous but he seems to be basically a good man. When he harbors a violent prostitute in his room in order to protect her and presumably to save her soul people begin to find out and assume that their relationship is sexual. His superiors assume the same and punish him for it. Later on he suffers even worse punishments from clerics.".

	schema:headline " Never think that is a contradiction its spiritual.";
	schema:reviewBody "The topic of religion in Buuel films is a point that one as an eater of films as an eater of art or as a person need to analyze hardly. One can see to a satirical Buuel in La Voie Lacte Un Chien Andalou or in L'Age d'Or. Is very hard and effective in its critic but when you have seen this and then you see a movie like Nazarin after you see this work you begin to be questioned about its author. And much have questioned about what seems to be a contradiction for Buuel thinks but is better not called in this way i think that there's not any contradiction in its work only that Buuel religion point of view is very diverse as unique in films.This beautiful film is based on the novel of Benito Perez Galds which told us the story of Father Nazario who lived a humble simple life dedicated to God and to help everyone. He lived in a simple and poor region. There lived too Beatriz who is an abused and abandoned wife. She don't find any sense of her life without her violent macho man. She have a kind of repulse to him. In the other side is Andara one of the towns prostitutes. Father Nazario has been stolen again he blames to Andara's cousin. Andara hear this and try to fight without success with the priest who don't believe in violence. That night Andara find that her cousin is actually a thief she have stole her bellboys. Andara fights with her cousin with terrible consequences. With this Andara search mercy from the priest. Nazario decides to help her knowing well that this could be against his church obviously this thing going to have some consequences. Since here Nazario going to be a pilgrim. Without nothing even without shoes but with spirit and faith. But Andara and Beatriz want to be with he and be like he to serve God.If is the sweetest Buuel film that i have seen so far is too the most spiritual. Is clear here that the thing that most confuse people with the contradiction is that here we don't see a Buuel against the power of church we see a Buuel whose film is about church but not in the typical  and great  satirical way. Whethever like it is i don't think that the right word is contradiction actually i find it pleasant and well done and in spite of contain such religious issues As his Voie Lacte i found it more a spiritual film but that don't try to touch in diversity the Catholic religion as maybe he touch and laugh of it in another films. Nazarin is of father Nazario and its perspective front God and the same religion but all of this is at the end analyzed in the spiritual life of this man.The other two women are not a contrast but as very well another two perspectives of faith. First we have Beatriz the mistreated woman that lose all the faith in life first with her husband and then with a little girl who was in her family. This little girl was very sick. At side of her was too Andara the prostitute who run of the justice. In the family of the child just religious women there a big pain but faith becomes in father Nazario when he arrives with nothing to this town. He bless the child a say later she is fine. The priest want go on walking but Beatriz and Andara have recovered the faith in life and want to dedicate their lives to God with father Nazario. After some complains father Nazario decide to be with them discovering with some things until the end how he feels about faith God religion and the person in necessity the people who must request to charity to survive. This last issue then must be noted as one possible explanation for the pineapple ending. This ending we listen the drums Similar to that in L'Age d'Or and a father Nazario walking over asking about this things when he refuse the fruit at the first time and at the end decide to receive it as a symbol of necessity or maybe as an answer for its spiritual road that begin being priest. Meanwhile the two women must take away of the father Andara for its crime Beautiful scene where she thanks a man who helps father Nazario in jail and then she damn the man who hit the priest in jail and Beatriz because she prefer be with her macho man in spite that he treat her bad just because she don't accept that she fall in loved with the priest. Father Nazario  and here is maybe the unique place in film to critic church walk to contradict the church the religion that he serves.Father Nazario is that then is a Soft for much but not for me critic for some thing in religion Father Nazario helping a women who is guilty of a crime of a sin but most of all is one of Buuel analysis of faith and life and he really got it with a beautiful tender sweet and unforgettable film that is without a doubt one of his best.Sorry for the mistakes...well if there any.".

He starred in three films directed by Buuel  Nazarn of course but then later Viridiana 1961 and Belle de jour 1967. Interestingly William Friedkin thought of Rabal for the villain of The French Connection 1971. However he could not remember the name of that Spanish actor. Mistakenly his staff hired another Spanish actor Fernando Rey. Friedkin discovered that Rabal did not speak English or French so he decided to keep Rey. Rabal had previously worked with Rey in Viridiana. Rabal did however work with Friedkin in the much less successful but Academy Awardnominated cult classic Sorcerer 1977 a remake of The Wages of Fear 1953.".

Some might call it a parallel to Christ's story but any follower and practitioner of the word life should be like Christ in a way. But in essence Bunuel also inquires into the ogle of man's selfishness and need to sin and how goodness may save us all. It is a bold statement to make that may enliven or recite to memory the movie for some. Truth be told the Nazarene is also selfish because he gives without wanting in return or asking for it. His selfishness is his folly and the two women who follow him represent the sides of a coinwith the same face on each side. Lots of people represent sides of a coin in this movie all with both faces the same. But the movie isn't exactly memorable once it ends and one could attack many of its ethical perforations and effusions within the movie's own doctrine.

Scanners II is both visually stunning with some great opening shots of Montreal and has a great comic book style plot. Yeah sure the connection to the first Scanners was kinda cheesy in execution but this film is alot faster in pace and has more action than the very slow paced Scanners.  The FX by Mike Smithson are great and very realistic before our dependence to all that is CGI.  But overall the performances are good but nothing to write home about.  Overall Scanners II has good cinematography and a clever little story of world domination to entertain fans as well as the casual viewer.  I suggest to anyone to check it out and be totally entertained for 100 minutes.".

Scanners was one of his best in his early period when he was working from original screenplays and wasn't in an adaptation funk at all ie. Naked Lunch M. Butterfly and Crash.  It was a promising plotline and was very entertaining.  It has also become a cult classic.  So when I saw this sequel when it first came out I didn't think it would be as good as it is.I'll spare you the plotline since you've undoubtably have read the other reviews but I will comment on the films structure.  It works surprisingly well considering the original didn't leave much for a sequel like this one. If one were to truly look at the first film for a sequel the likely route would have been to have the main characters be on the run from the secret corporate organizations a plotline used in Firestarter which could lead to a very boring and predictable outcome.  But this film was made ten years later and the plotline ideas can have new twists and it is this factor that makes this film a success.The opening ropes you in by the way it mimics the opening to the originalhomeless drifting Scanner losses mind in public and gets corralled by the guys in shades and trenchcoats.  But its different from the original opening in that Scanners 2 opens with the vagabond Scanner screaming at the city in agony as the mental voices of the population invade his extrasensory mind and drive him crazy.  It would be like an itch you can't scratch.  I liked this aspect of the opening and it made me realize the filmmaker was a huge fan of the first film.  It proved he wanted to be true to the first film and not just make another sequel in name only.  The plot device of making the Scanners junkies to mind suppressing drugs was another excellent addition.  It further proves the filmmaker's desire to make a good sequel.If you loved the first film you have to give this one a try.  It is very entertaining great character development and delivers in the gore factor department.".

He is approached by a research lab that is trying to find fresh Scanners who are not psychopaths one of the side effects of the mutation is that it often drives those affected completely insane.

Many plot elements are recycled from Part One most notably the scanner oblivious to his powers and a battle between a 'good' and 'bad' one however the film also takes the concept in refreshing new directions. His detective work as a scanner is fascinating even if we only ever really see it in action once there is a great bit where he uses scanning to stop a store robbery another scanner controls video arcade machines with his abilities and at its most touching our protagonist inadvertently uses his scanning powers to comfort and calm down pet store animals. The film is very well photographed too with lots of low camera angles and tracking shots courtesy of 'My Bloody Valentine' cinematographer Rodney Gibbons. The biggest minus here is the acting which varies from noncharismatic to annoyingly overthetop with Raoul Max Trujillo the worst offender in the latter regard. The action sequences are solid the special effects are almost as good as in the original and while the atmosphere is never the same the film at least manages to add a lot of extra ideas to the mythology of scanners.".

With such a special gift he is quickly recruited by power hungry Commander John Forrester Yvan Ponton who wants to use David as a tool in the building of a totalitarian 'new order'. However when David realises that Forrester is a fascist dictator in the making he rebels pitting him in a desperate battle against Forrester's less idealistic scanners of which Peter Drak Raoul Max Trujillo is the most powerful.Horrible saxophone score aside there isn't really much to dislike about The New Order director Christian Duguay keeps things moving along at a reasonable pace the cinematography is good there are two juicy exploding noggins although neither are as shocking as FX genius Dick Smith's handiwork in Cronenberg's movie and rounding out the cast are Deborah Raffin as David's babelicious older sister Julie Tom Butler as nasty Doctor Morse and Isabelle Mejias as David's girlfriend Alice Leonardo.6.5 out of 10 rounded up to 7 for IMDb.".

When I sat down to watch the sequel I had a good idea of what I was getting myself into  an unconnected Bmovie in name only made in 1991 so probably pretty cheesy. Boy I was wrong! This is a sequel that follows the original film pretty closely but puts a fresh spin on proceedings and it actually doesn't come off too badly in comparison to the first. Sure the director can't hope to match Cronenberg's work but for the most part this is a pacy exciting little thriller with some wellstaged action scenes. And it's only a little bit cheesy.David Hewlett makes for a charismatic lead and he's ably supported by an intriguing cast. This being a Canadian production half of the actors are French and Yvan Ponton is the best of the lot a truly hissable and appalling villain. It was great to see Isabelle Mejias again after her titular role in videonasty era horror flick JULIE DARLING Mejias is an actress with an indefinable hypnotic quality about her. I would describe her as elfin and she lights up the screen whenever I see her it's a shame she hasn't done more work. Raoul Trujillo playing an evil scanner goes way over the top but there was something about his crazed energetic performance that grabs your attention in the same way that Jim Carrey does. Of course there are the requisite exploding heads and other bubbly grisly special effect sequences and these are all wellhandled. This is a fine little film that puts other Bmovies from the era to shame.".

	schema:headline " Scanners  if David Cronenberg was a comicbook fan";
	schema:reviewBody "David Cronenbergs original Scanners was a one of a kind film it was science fiction it was horror an action film yet it felt more like a drama the characters firmly in the centre of attention. We were able to relate to the Scanners seeing them as normal human beings who had superpowers that were at the same time a disease.The sequel takes a slightly different turn the action and science fiction elements churned up it feels more like a RoboCop then a Scannerssequel and the ampedup colour sound and specialeffects give the film a comic bookfeel. A good example is the use of the drug 'Ephemerol' in the original it's a medicine that has no effect on 'normal' people but temporarily cures the Scanners from the sideeffects of their powers in Scanners 2 it's a drug that turns Scanners and nonScanners alike into baldheaded addicts eventually killing them.In the original film there's a 'sound' of what the Scanners hear in their heads permeating almost every scene fractions of sentences and words voices and noise the viewer can relate why the Scanners live a tortured existence. Here the 'Scannersound' is reduced to a light vibrating noise that sets in ever time a Scanner uses his powers.Christian Duguay clearly is no David Cronenberg the director is more at home at the straighttovideo horror and science fiction genre. Not to say that the director is doing a bad job within the limits of above mentioned genre it's a very neat movie but to give you a reference imagine Wim Wenders Wings of Desire being remade by Brad Silverling.As for the acting most of the performances are Bmovie at best but adequate for a sequel like Scanners II. Especially the villains Tom Butler Yvan Ponton Vlasta Vrana and Michael Rudder seemed to have climbed straight from a comic book. Special mention should go to Raoul Trujillo decades before he'd play 'Zero Wolf' the monstrous Mayan bounty hunter in Apocalypto who fantastically hams it up as psychopathic Scanner Peter Drak.The gorefactor one of the trademarks of the Scannersfranchise has been hyped up a notch or two never reaching the level 'splattermovie' but often coming close. However especially younger viewers should be warned that this movie comes from a preCGI era relying entirely on special effects not computer animation hence may seem a little rough on eyes used to contemporary CGI.All in all it's an enjoyable little romp but suffers the fate of most remakes it just doesn't stand the comparison to the original. If you came for action exploding heads and the archetypical Scannergrimacing you cannot go wrong with Scanners 2  but if you consider the original film a piece of art and hope for a similarly inspired film you might leave disappointed.8 points for being a 90's videocheapo of it's own right 5 as a sequel to an artfilm like Scanners so I settle for 7 points out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "David Cronenbergs original Scanners was a one of a kind film it was science fiction it was horror an action film yet it felt more like a drama the characters firmly in the centre of attention. We were able to relate to the Scanners seeing them as normal human beings who had superpowers that were at the same time a disease.The sequel takes a slightly different turn the action and science fiction elements churned up it feels more like a RoboCop then a Scannerssequel and the ampedup colour sound and specialeffects give the film a comic bookfeel. A good example is the use of the drug 'Ephemerol' in the original it's a medicine that has no effect on 'normal' people but temporarily cures the Scanners from the sideeffects of their powers in Scanners 2 it's a drug that turns Scanners and nonScanners alike into baldheaded addicts eventually killing them.In the original film there's a 'sound' of what the Scanners hear in their heads permeating almost every scene fractions of sentences and words voices and noise the viewer can relate why the Scanners live a tortured existence.

And maybe it was... once upon a time. However there are those films that stand the test of time and then there are those who do not age well. I feel this is the latter.It's about more of those psychics or 'scanners' as they call them here. A corrupt police chief wants to harness their unnatural power to end crime and generally make himself equally powerful. But after years of experimenting on boring scanners who no one cares about he finds lovely nice scanner 'David' to exploit. But luckily for all that is good David is too nice to be used and sets about ending this corrupt cop's regime before it really starts.Whereas you can watch Star Wars and not be bothered by the 'seventies haircuts' Han and Luke are sporting here everything just seems waaaay too eighties which is doubly ironic as it's made in 1990.But it's not just the look of the film I disliked  it's also the story. Everything just happens to fit together waaay too well to be believable. It's one coincidence and obvious plotmotivating device after the next. The seeminglymandatory love story is quite unnecessary and forced plus the characters either underact or overact and I'm thinking about the 'bad scanner' when I mention overacting  he's practically a pantomime villain he's that nasty!. Yes there's the odd bit of decent gore but that's a small part of an 1 hour 40 minute film.Maybe this was an okay film in the eighties or if you've never seen the original but if you're looking for dark and nasty horror stick to the first Scanners  it's head and shoulders over this one.".

	schema:headline " A vague concept and some nice set pieces do not cover a lack of logic tension or narrative cohesion";
	schema:reviewBody "For us normal people luck comes in streaks of good and bad sometimes we have rotten luck sometimes we fluke something and sometimes miracles happen. However for some people luck is a gift that is always with them but can be lost with the touch of another person with the same gift. When Federico is stripped of his gift by Samuel a survivor of the concentration camps he sets out to find another gifted as he was and use him as a way back into the series of games they play. He finds Tomas  the only survivor or a massive airplane crash that killed over 230 others. However when Tomas flees his hospital bed he is pursued by a police officer haunted by the loss of her husband and son who also has the gift.This film opens with a cool sense of atmosphere with people wearing hoods long corridors mysterious characters and so on providing it with a good start but not one it builds on. That it manages to continue with a good visual style and a cool thriller atmosphere is what I will give it credit for but to me these are not enough to make this film work. The plot is very little more than a basic premise which although it acted as a very interesting hook failed to serve anything in the way of substance or narrative up. The plot lacks logic and it relies on a series of reasonably good set pieces the games to keep the interest in the film up  I can see why Hollywood has bough the rights to remake it because it does have style and if it gets a big name and a thriller director the lack of substance shouldn't worry too many execs. The ending is good but by that point I wasn't feeling all that involved in the film and it had missed its chance to really get me on board.In many ways the film reminded me of Lucky Star which some may remember was an advert pretending to be a trailer for a film about a man with impossible luck played by Del Toro and directed by Michael Mann but I thought the advert did it better. The characters are also pretty thin I expected them to be complex and interesting considering the plot but they were tools more than people.

Sbaraglia was a good presence with a good range Poncela was coolly mysterious Lopez was passionate and held the attention but von Sydow just seems to be off in his own film somewhere just filling time with the second unit director until the rest of the cast meet up with him.Overall this has a concept that will bring many too it but it doesn't do anything with it and it never really managed to get a good involving story built up around it nor create characters to be held by. It is not terrible though just hollow and unsatisfying  a few set pieces and consistently stylish direction and atmosphere all add value but this will be one time when I'm actually looking to a Hollywood remake to be an improvement.".

	onyx:emotionText "For us normal people luck comes in streaks of good and bad sometimes we have rotten luck sometimes we fluke something and sometimes miracles happen. However for some people luck is a gift that is always with them but can be lost with the touch of another person with the same gift. When Federico is stripped of his gift by Samuel a survivor of the concentration camps he sets out to find another gifted as he was and use him as a way back into the series of games they play. He finds Tomas  the only survivor or a massive airplane crash that killed over 230 others. However when Tomas flees his hospital bed he is pursued by a police officer haunted by the loss of her husband and son who also has the gift.This film opens with a cool sense of atmosphere with people wearing hoods long corridors mysterious characters and so on providing it with a good start but not one it builds on. That it manages to continue with a good visual style and a cool thriller atmosphere is what I will give it credit for but to me these are not enough to make this film work. The plot is very little more than a basic premise which although it acted as a very interesting hook failed to serve anything in the way of substance or narrative up. The plot lacks logic and it relies on a series of reasonably good set pieces the games to keep the interest in the film up  I can see why Hollywood has bough the rights to remake it because it does have style and if it gets a big name and a thriller director the lack of substance shouldn't worry too many execs. The ending is good but by that point I wasn't feeling all that involved in the film and it had missed its chance to really get me on board.In many ways the film reminded me of Lucky Star which some may remember was an advert pretending to be a trailer for a film about a man with impossible luck played by Del Toro and directed by Michael Mann but I thought the advert did it better. The characters are also pretty thin I expected them to be complex and interesting considering the plot but they were tools more than people. With this in mind the cast actually did OK with what they have. Sbaraglia was a good presence with a good range Poncela was coolly mysterious Lopez was passionate and held the attention but von Sydow just seems to be off in his own film somewhere just filling time with the second unit director until the rest of the cast meet up with him.Overall this has a concept that will bring many too it but it doesn't do anything with it and it never really managed to get a good involving story built up around it nor create characters to be held by.

What if Luck were a quantifiable commodity and certain people had the ability to take it from others?  What if such people were only one in a billion?  The premise reminded me somewhat of Unbreakable but this movie has so many more complex characters and is so much better written yes really.However the more I think about this film the more I realize how much I disliked the cinematography editing production design and lighting.  I know they probably didn't have a lot of money to spend but a good DP isn't hard to find.  Making much of the movie literally dark to go with the psychological darkness was a fine idea but executed poorly.  It's unfortunate.The script would make a great read though and I suspect that's why the film was able to be made.  Those talking about Adaptation as an argument for a screenplay to be a legitimate piece of literature would do well to read Intacto and leave it at that.As a film though I'd still recommend it.  Good job keeping Max von Sydow away from the other actors... he acts circles around them.  But the others do okay too.  810.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are a few good filmmakers alive now ones I credit. Mostly they are distributed in accidental pools of the industry a couple in Hong Kong a master in Amsterdam a few passing through Hollywood it seems. Singles here and there. But there are three film communities that when I enter them I feel as if I am entering a magical kitchen of imagemaking shared by a single family. The blood pumping between one pair of lovers the enhanced tongue of another the wild creative dialog about spices among a young crowd in the corner  each of these somehow providing juices I will taste.One of these kitchens is Australian another Canadian oh how puzzling!. But this big saucy one is Spanish with emissaries all over the Americas. Not every Spanish film is nourishing but when I find one that has serious ambitions it more often than not inherits all the smells traditions and many of the skills of that kitchen that world.Superficially this is an ambitious project with a young filmmaker whose visual skills aren't unusual and he has been helped by a crew that pulls off most of the cinematic needs of his scenes. The techniques themselves aren't very striking.See this. It is not full of new ways of seeing story as you find with Medem. It has no novel parallel narratives as you'll often find. But it parallels it does have else it wouldn't be in this tradition I like so much of magical overlays of reality up and down.What is striking is the typically Spanish shape of the thing. Folded realities agents of fate placed among us the narrative as game that includes a game. The tokens of the game as images and placed in images we win. Some players as noir characters others as filmmakers in the thing.This juxtaposition of noirrelated game with gambling with images with conflating images in the film with images of the film is unique. Remember when you saw the first film of a gifted filmmaker and began a rewarding life with a new friend? Here's one for you a new friend. I do not think he will disappoint.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

Mostly they are distributed in accidental pools of the industry a couple in Hong Kong a master in Amsterdam a few passing through Hollywood it seems. Singles here and there. But there are three film communities that when I enter them I feel as if I am entering a magical kitchen of imagemaking shared by a single family. The blood pumping between one pair of lovers the enhanced tongue of another the wild creative dialog about spices among a young crowd in the corner  each of these somehow providing juices I will taste.One of these kitchens is Australian another Canadian oh how puzzling!. But this big saucy one is Spanish with emissaries all over the Americas. Not every Spanish film is nourishing but when I find one that has serious ambitions it more often than not inherits all the smells traditions and many of the skills of that kitchen that world.Superficially this is an ambitious project with a young filmmaker whose visual skills aren't unusual and he has been helped by a crew that pulls off most of the cinematic needs of his scenes. The techniques themselves aren't very striking.See this. It is not full of new ways of seeing story as you find with Medem. It has no novel parallel narratives as you'll often find. But it parallels it does have else it wouldn't be in this tradition I like so much of magical overlays of reality up and down.What is striking is the typically Spanish shape of the thing. Folded realities agents of fate placed among us the narrative as game that includes a game. The tokens of the game as images and placed in images we win. Some players as noir characters others as filmmakers in the thing.This juxtaposition of noirrelated game with gambling with images with conflating images in the film with images of the film is unique. Remember when you saw the first film of a gifted filmmaker and began a rewarding life with a new friend? Here's one for you a new friend. I do not think he will disappoint.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.";

	schema:reviewBody "Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo became famous in Spain by being nominated for the Oscar for best short subject with his short Esposados which I found refreshing but somewhat overrated. Anyways... he went to Hollywood knowing that he didn't have a chance of winning and wanting to take his chances of selling the rights for distribution of three films to Miramax. The first of these films is called Intacto starring argentinian Leonardo Sbaraglia spaniard Eusebio Poncela and swedish Max von Sydow yes The Exorcist in person.The plot The film starts at a casino in the middle of a desert. We know there two characters Federico Poncela and Sam Sydow. The first one is the protegee of the second the master of luck... a man who has the power to get other people's luck by touching  even hugging  them and by getting photos of them... well... Federico was the sole survivor of an earthquake and Sam was also the sole survivor of a nazi camp... both has high amount of luck and also Federico at this time is the only person allowed to see Sam's face!Federico thinks it's high time he got his own way away from Sam who has raised him since childhood and that earthquake... so Sam is not going to let Federico go... with his good luck.A few years later we meet Federico searching fortunate people that can let him get back to Sam and have revenge... because Federico now has the power of give bad luck to the people who touch him... or that he touches. After a failed  another failed we suppose  attempt to find the right person with the right luck he manages to meet Tomas a thief that is the sole survivor of a plane crash and is in an hospital under arrest. He frees Tomas and offers him to play some games in which anything but money is can be bet.Then we know Sara Monica Lopez a female cop which wants to catch Tomas again and has herself her own personal history with luck good? bad? you can never tell this is one of the most moving characters in the film... and the hunt begins.I won't go too far in details of what happens next with the sole exception of that another important character is introduced a bullfighter Antonio Dechent who retired without ever being harmed... and also likes to play the games Federico and Tomas NEED to play.The ending of course will take place at the casino with the five main characters being involved... it is no spoiler since from the first minutes of the film it is clear that the casino is for Federico what Itaca was for Ulysses. The difference is that instead of Penelope's love he's looking for revenge.The acting range from very good Lopez Dechent to great Sydow Sbaraglia and Poncela. I foresee a best actor nod at the Goyas Spanish Oscars for Eusebio Poncela.The flaws of the film... a few. The most important for me was that in a couple of times the director remarked too much some aspects I think too much explanation is bad. And also it is maybe a little slow for the average thriller viewer but this is more like Unbreakable... Yeah it has many shares with Unbreakable but it is really different. To compare both films is just as dumb as to do so with The Sixth Sense with The Others. Needless to say that Unbreakable and Intacto doesn't share endings at all... don't expect a twist ending in this one and that is the first of the strenghts of the film is that one FINALLY A THRILLER WITHOUT TWIST ENDING!.The strenghts Fresnadillo's direction is strong. When I saw the film I somehow KNEW this one is going to go to America and success. Believe me. Another Fincher? I don't think so but he's good enough. The landscapes the movie was shot at the Canary Islands and the game scenes are great!How I rate this film? 8 points. 4 stars out of five. Could have been a masterpiece but it delivers the goods. And it is fairly better than most of the thrillers I've seen in a long time.".

Friedemann was quite a talented and fascinating composer in his own right though probably not as great as his famous father who composed some very interesting and beautiful music. Yes he was quite a free spirit and was both as a person and as a composer remarkably different from his father.But how I ask did those responsible for the soundtrack get it into their minds to transform Friedemann's fashionably for the time graceful and sensitive melodies into some grotesquely anachronistic postromantic musical wallpaper? And why was it so hard to fill the entire soundtrack with period music  people did it in Amadeus Immortal Beloved and Farinelli to name just a few so why not here? With all due respect to the composer of the soundtrack's original music I thought his music was just way too anachronistic for me to sustain my suspension of disbelief. I simply couldn't believe in the story anymore.Among the countless nonmusical historical inaccuracies let me mention just one. Unlike in the movie Bach according to many reputable biographical sources didn't flatly refuse to improvise anything on Friedrich's theme. In fact he pulled off the threepart fugue originally proposed by the King and only withdrew after the sixpart fugue was proposed the latter being too difficult to improvise.So no more than 4 stars for this cinematographic lemon. This could've been 7 had the soundtrack compilers done a better job.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Musical Offering' by JS Bach is one of the greatest masterpieces in the music written by a human and one of the highest tops of musical thought. But the film is not mostly about how that was composed but rather about dramatic fragments in Bach's and Fredrick's families. Juergen Vogel played a complex personality of the Prussian King with conviction. Vadim Glovna as Bach however playing his role reflected Bach's character in such a realistic and simple way that you could forget about a sublime genius a part of the universal mind which was Bach. But even such a giant acknowledges music being much more essential than the human being. The family is not eternal music however... he said talking to his son's wife. Glovna very honestly performed Bach as just a mortal man with his doubts fears smiles and cries. And the final scene is so emotional although nothing particular happens. I sincerely recommend this movie to every one of Bach's and his music fans and the ones who like the historical drama on the screen".

Vadim Glovna as Bach however playing his role reflected Bach's character in such a realistic and simple way that you could forget about a sublime genius a part of the universal mind which was Bach. But even such a giant acknowledges music being much more essential than the human being. The family is not eternal music however... he said talking to his son's wife. Glovna very honestly performed Bach as just a mortal man with his doubts fears smiles and cries. And the final scene is so emotional although nothing particular happens. I sincerely recommend this movie to every one of Bach's and his music fans and the ones who like the historical drama on the screen";

This movie did nothing for me. I thought this would be a good opportunity to have a great soundtrack of Bach music but most of the music in it is by the film's soundtrack composer Frederic Devreese. Good period costuming and set design. Vadim Glowna is excellent as Johann Sebastian Bach. This film was shot on Super 16 and printed to 35mm and almost all of this film is shot with hand held cameras. I could only muster up a Fair rating for my review. I would give this a 5.5 on a scale of 10 and I could not recommend it.".

	schema:headline " Weak from almost every perspective lacks subtlety crucially";
	schema:reviewBody "Mein Name ist Bach is a coproduction between France Germany and Switzerland from 2003. The country I mentioned last is probably crucial here as this is probably the careerdefining work by director Dominique de Rivaz who is also one of the writers here because the film received strong awards recognition in Switzerland was eventually also chosen to represent the country at the Oscars back then where the film did not even get close to a nomination though. Not unexpected in my opinion but I'll get to that later. Most German filmmakers would really be intrigued by the prospect of Glowna Vogel Herfurth Taubman Buck and the very recently deceased Rehberg as part of their project but they definitely did not manage to use the strong cast list to an extent here where this could and should have become a strong period piece. As the title gives away this film centers around the life of famous composer Johann Sebastian Bach in his later years and especially on his conflict with Friedrich II. I must say that I didn't like the title too much. It says nothing sounding like a Bollywood movie set in Germany while actually trying to say a lot. It also sounds a bit like a biopic in my opinion which it absolutely is not.Anyway the big problem here is not the name but it is the script. It lacks subtlety entirely and goes over the top in a cringeworthy fashion on quite a few occasions. One would be when Vogel's character starts singing randomly and the singing component was generally a big weakness. Another even worse situation was the table scene where everybody except Bach had sheets over their heads. Meh... The worst is that some of these scenes were intended as the most poignant and most memorable of the movie and that is just not working out. So the actors were given weak material on Vogel's occasion especially even if what he did with it was not really tolerable either or they were simply not given enough material and screen time quantitywise so that an otherwise solid actress like Herfurth was pretty much wasted. I guess visually you cannot say really anything negative as costumes and sets were okay and the ending  last shot wasn't too bad either. However the tiny pros cannot make up for the big cons here. I give My Name Is Bach a thumbsdown as it is nothing but a very poor man's version of Amadeus as we depict the fall of a genius in the face of an oh too powerful rival. It was rightfully not nominated for an Oscar and I suggest you skip these 1.5 hours.".

Franco contributes great direction and a perfectly eerie atmosphere to this lowbudget film which was one of Soledad's most prominent international roles.

Franco appears in the film as he does in many of his movies as a servant to Professor Van Helsing. Franco contributes great direction and a perfectly eerie atmosphere to this lowbudget film which was one of Soledad's most prominent international roles. The talented cast and direction as well as a fantastic score by Bruno Nicolai make this one of the best filmed versions of the Dracula story and a great companion to Francis Ford Coppola's version made decades later.";

Lom at first appears to be walking through his role but as the movie progresses his Van Helsing becomes so subtly shaded as to rival Dracula for the viewers attention. A fine film that would have benifited from a larger budget Note the German Shepherds which stand in for wolves! El Conde Dracula can be enjoyed by the vampire novice as well as the enthusiast. This is the first major Dracula film to depict the Counts Lizard Crawl down the Castle Wall and the wolf attack on the grieving mother. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd been wanting to check out Franco's 'faithful' rendition of Bram Stoker's classic vampire tale ever since I came upon a review of it in two horrorfilm reference books from the mid70s written by Alan Frank. When the Dark Sky R1 DVD was announced I was overjoyed  but this was soon dissipated by reports that their print was missing some footage I still intended to pick up that edition for the interesting supplements Franco interview star Christopher Lee reading excerpts from the novel but an upcoming German 2Disc Set is supposed to be complete as well as featuring an Audio Commentary with Franco and costar Fred Williams! Anyway having watched the film now  via the Spanish DVD  I don't think the additional footage was fair trade for the lack of an option to include the Englishlanguage track or at least English subtitles while I'm obviously familiar with the storyline so that I had no difficulty following the proceedings I missed hearing the Stoker dialogue  not to mention Lee and Herbert Lom's distinctive voices!Its overall effect is worlds removed from the Hammer outings which starred Lee these were actually still going on when COUNT Dracula was made but he had become increasingly disenchanted with their approach. Lowkey deliberatelypaced and hampered by severe budgetary constraints resulting in shoddy effects and a distinct lack of props the film nevertheless makes the most of its Spanish locations  even if Manuel Merino's shaky camerawork displays an unwarranted propensity for zoom shots while an attack ostensibly taking the vampire's POV then bafflingly reveals Dracula to be coming from a totally different direction!. The soundtrack highlights Bruno Nicolai's typically reliable score at once evocative and moody but it's punctuated by weird  and amusing  slurping sounds during the vampire attacks! The Spanish DVD presents the film in its correct fullframe aspect ratio though the transfer itself lends the whole an unrealistic orange hue as opposed to the bluish tones for nighttime sequences which have been mentioned online with respect to the Dark Sky edition.It has been said that Lee's performance in COUNT Dracula is superior to his various interpretations in the Hammer films while I certainly appreciated his different approach to the role he is still given relatively little time in which to work his magic no pun intended interestingly the vampire starts off as an old man here but is gradually rejuvenated through his bloodsucking habits a concept originating in Stoker and picked up again by Francis Ford Coppola for his BRAM STOKER'S Dracula 1992 another wouldbe rigorous adaptation. The rest of the main cast is virtually a Who's Who of Franco's filmography during this time Herbert Lom makes for an imposing Van Helsing due to the language barrier I didn't understand why he was suddenly wheelchairbound  but from the Eccentric Cinema review I gathered that the character had suffered a stroke Klaus Kinski is a creepy Renfield able to create a character by saying almost nothing at all  he had already done similar duties for Franco as the Marquis De Sade in the 1968 version of Justine and by the way it's interesting that the actor would himself eventually play Dracula twice in NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE 1979 and the Italianmade NOSFERATU A VENEZIA 1988 Maria Rohm as Mina looking ravishing but who's rather underused throughout Soledad Miranda as Lucy she only really comes into her own when turned into a vampire which actually precedes her iconic turn in Franco's VAMPYROS LESBOS 1970  itself a very loose adaptation of Dracula! Fred Williams as Harker Jack Taylor as Quincey Paul Muller as Dr. Seward and even Franco himself as Van Helsing's dopeylooking yet vaguely sinister manservant.For all its shortcomings it wouldn't be a Franco film if it weren't flawed COUNT Dracula still provides a fair quota of memorable moments Dracula silencing the wolves outside his castle Dracula feeding a baby to his 'brides' Dracula's attacks on Miranda twice interrupted by Rohm whom he eventually gets to of all places at an opera house! Miranda's bloody demise in her coffin the stuffed animals in Dracula's London home coming to life to scare the vampire hunters Lom burning a crossshape on the floor in his clinic to ward off the approaching vampire blood spurting in Taylor's face from his staking of a vampire woman in Dracula's castle Dracula's fiery comeuppance actually similar to Miranda's  not to mention Bela Lugosi in the 1931 Universal classic  in that he's dispatched while at his most vulnerable i.e. asleep in his coffin.It's unfortunate that none of the companies who released  or are set to release  the film on DVD seem to hold the rights to CUADECUC VAMPIR 1970 a documentary shot at the time of COUNT Dracula's production. By the way I should eventually be following this viewing of the film with several more Francos including alternate versions of two monster mashes on similar lines but even more idiosyncratic namely Dracula  PRISONER OF FRANKENSTEIN 1971 and THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN aka THE EROTIC RITES OF FRANKENSTEIN 19723.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jess Franco's version of the Bram Stoker classic has Count Dracula as an old count who grows younger whenever he dines on the blood of gorgeous maidens . Bram Stoker's Count Dracula 1970 turns out to be an acceptable picture directed by Jesus Franco with a good cast as Christopher Lee  Hebert Lom  Maria Rohm and Klaus Kinski . It is a passable and averagebudgeted version with splendid players  functional set design and brilliant costumes . The picture begins in a prologue Over 50 years ago Bram Stoker wrote the greatest of all horror stories. Now for the first time we retell exactly as he wrote one of the firstand still the besttales of the macabre. A young lawyer named Jonathan Harker Fred Williams is assigned to go to a creepy castle in the mists of eastern Europe . Harker is captured and imprisoned by a strange character who is accompanied by his bloodsucker girlfriends Emma Cohen  Jeannine Mestre . He really is a vampire who lives on through the ages and gone back life . The undead vampire named Dracula Christopher Lee comes to England to seduce Mina Maria Rhom and Lucy Soledad Mirandaand inflict havoc in the foreign land . As it is said that Dracula has extraordinary powers  but these supernatural powers have sinister origins  and this is the first film in which  like in the novel Dracula begins as an old man and becomes younger as he feeds. Later on  at a Sanitarium outside London Harker awakens in bed with Dr John Seward Paul Muller at his side . Dracula goes London and starts a reign of seduction and horror draining the life from Mina's closest friend  Lucy . But Dracula has not counted on young Lords Fred Williams and Jack Taylor acquiring the assistance of the Vampire hunter Herbert Lom .European coproduction between various countries as Spain  West Germany  Italy  Liechtenstein . This thrilling as well as terrifying film contains horrifying scenes  chills  lots of gore and red tomato was used for the blood . This version of Dracula is closely based on Bram Stoker's 1897 classic novel of the same title . Adequate version about the famous personage with an European allstar cast  poor cinematography by Manuel Merino though would have been necessary a photography similarly to Hammer Films  glamorous gowns and regular production design  including evocative sights on Victorian London  actually shot in Alicante Barcelona Catalua  Estudios Cinematogrficos Balczar Esplugues de Llobregat Barcelona Catalua Spain and Munich Bavaria Germany . Christopher Lee who plays a splendid Dracula and Herbert Lom who plays stunningly Dr. Van Helsing  never saw each other during the filming. They shot all their joint scenes separately . Christopher Lee was reportedly tired of playing Dracula and was convinced to join the cast only after being promised that the film would be a faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula novel  the film however ultimately made numerous significant changes to the story . Filmmaker Jess Franco's first choice for the role of Van Helsing was Vincent Price. He was not able to obtain Price due to his exclusive contract with American International Pictures and second choice Dennis Price was forced to withdraw through illness  Franco was able to get his third choice Herbert Lom for the role. Although the producer claims that Klaus Kinski was hoodwinked into playing Renfield when producers gave him a script with a fake title director Jess Franco says this was not true and he claims that Klaus Kinski ate real flies as Renfield instead of fake ones. Special mention to rousing and powerful musical score composed and conducted by Bruno Nicolai . Interesting script by writers Jess Franco Erich Krhnke  Harry Alan Towers as Peter Welbeck also film producer . Other films retelling the known legend based as originally conceived on this novel are the following   Dracula 1974 by Dan Curtis with Jack Palance  Simon Ward Nigel Davenport  Bram's Stoker Dracula'with David Suchet as Abraham Van Helsing  Marc Warren as Count Dracula and Sophia Myles as Lucy  the best results to be Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula with Gary Oldman  Winona Ryder  Gary Elwes  Keanu Reeves and Anthony Hopkins and last version Dracula2012 by Dario Argento with Rutger Hauer as Abraham Van Helsing  Asia Argento as Lucy  Unax Ugalde as Johnathan Harker and Thomas Kretschmann as Dracula .".

	schema:headline " Better Than Franco's Usual Efforts . . .";
	schema:reviewBody "The prolific Spanish director Jesus Franco who has helmed over 160 films makes marginal movies. Essentially Franco's films contain only vestiges of drama urgency and sentiment. The mystery is that Franco has made so many films when most qualify as unremarkable. Franco's Count Dracula surpasses most of his monotonous movies but it too suffers from anemia. Christopher Lee made a name for himself playing the most celebrated vampire in English literature Bram Stoker's immortal vampire and the elegant but imposing actor reprises his role for Franco as Dracula. Admittedly Franco and scenarist Harry Alan Towers a.k.a. Peter Welbeck of The Blood of Fu Manchu strove for greater fidelity to the classic novel. Nevertheless they do take liberties with the narrative the undermine Count Dracula. Chiefly the budgetary boundaries that they confronted compelled them to eliminate Dracula's voyage to England on the Demeter and they have omitted the relationship between Jonathan Harker and R.M. Renfield. Although Lee and fellow costars Herbert Lom and Klaus Kinski give Count Dracula some credibility by appearing in it their marquee value is negated by the lackluster storyline. Aside from the solid cast the only other asset that Count Dracula boasts is Bruno Nicolai's brilliantly atmospheric orchestral score that injects some suspense and tension into this dreary stuff. Among other things Nicolai served as the arranger and conductor for the legendary Ennio Morricone on most of his best soundtracks.The story takes place in 1897. Wannabe attorney Jonathan Harker Frederick Williams of A Bridge Too Far travels from England to Transylvania where he confers with Count Dracula Christopher Lee of Horror of Dracula about a real estate property that the nobleman wants to purchase outside of London. The early scenes show Harker traveling by train to see the Count. He doesn't understand why some of the people that he meets want to keep their distance from him. At his hotel the innkeeper's wife warns him of his impending danger. Harker takes a stagecoach to Count Dracula's castle. The first coach deposits him in the middle of the wilderness. After a short wait another arrives with a coachman suspiciously resembling the Count who offers Harker a flash of whiskey with which he may fortify himself. Harker refuses the coachman's offer and climbs aboard the vehicle.Count Dracula Christopher Lee meets Harker at his castle. Enter freely and of your own will the Count bids him without explanation. No sooner has Dracula shown Harker to his room than the Englishmen is puzzled by an unusual sight. The mirror in his room casts a reflection of himself but shows nothing of the Count standing alongside him. Later Harker asks the whitehaired heavily mustached Dracula why he has chosen to leave his castle in the Carpathian wilds he replied I am not young but I am restless. Harker's comments prompt Dracula to relive the exploits of his bloody past when he helped to repulse the invading Turks. Finally Dracula concludes his monologue The wind blows coldly through these broken battlements. Although this is my home I must move on. Harker observes that he could have sent the Count the real estate papers through the mail. Disagreeing with Harker Dracula explains that he wanted to learn something about the people and customs of his new home and so he invited Harker as his guest. At this point Harker's hackles rise at the howls of wildlife around the castle. Dracula utters his immortal line. Listen to them the children of the night what music they do make. Later Dracula intervenes when three of his women are poised to suck every last drop of blood from a supine Harker's throat. As it turns out Harker has been dreaming. He decides to escape from Dracula's castle and does a header out of a window. The next time that we see him he is a patient in Dr. Seward's sanitarium. Dr. John Seward Paul Muller of Lady Frankenstein operates an asylum for the mentally ill and one of his consulting colleagues is Professor Abraham Van Helsing Herbert Lom of Mysterious Island who has been studying the 'black arts.' Seward explains to Harker's fiance Mina MurrayMaria Rohm of Twenty Four Hours to Kill that her future husband was brought to his sanitarium because of the outrageous stories that he told about Count Dracula and an army of bats. Mina has been accompanied by her friend Lucy Soledad Miranda of She Killed in Ecstasy and she faints when she hears one of the patients screaming. Later we learn that R.M. Renfield Klaus Kinski of Nosferatu is kept there because he told a trip to Transylvania. Renfield's daughter died from loss of blood and has been insane and eating insect since her demise. Meantime Dracula has moved into the house across the road from Seward's clinic unbeknownst to any of the occupants until Harker realizes later that the count is residing there. Mina walks in on Dracula sucking the blood out of Mina and we get the scariest shot in Count Dracula. Eventually Harker and Lucy's fiance Quincy Jack Taylor pursue Dracula and burn him in his coffin.Believe it or not Count Dracula surpasses the typical Franco fiasco. Lee delivers a terrific soliloquy in his castle about his valorous combat against the invading Turkish horde but he doesn't have half as many lines after he forsakes his castle. Lee appears appropriately sinister but he is rarely frightening. As perfectly cast as he is as Renfield Kinski seems wasted in a peripheral role while Herbert Lom fares best with more substantial role as Van Helsing. Count Dracula is clearly an example of 1970's filmmaking. Franco's longtime collaborator lenser Manuel Merino relies heavily on zooms to indicate surprise and tension. Meanwhile Franco directs with his customary lack of fanfare and rarely covers a scene with additional shots. The Spanish production values are good but there aren't any scenes set in London. Francis Ford Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula is a far better retelling than Franco's Count Dracula.".

	schema:headline " Arguably The Most Loyal Adaptation Of Bram Stoker's Novel";
	schema:reviewBody "Although entirely different to Hammer's Dracula films starring Chrisopher Lee Jess Franco's Count Dracula aka. Nachts Wenn Dracula Erwacht of 1970 is a creepy and great film and in many aspects the most loyal adaption of Bram Stoker's novel. Director Jess Franco must be one of the most prolific directors in the history of cinema definitely the most prolific I know and his 180 movies include bigtime stinkers as well as masterpieces. One of his great films Count Dracula is a movie with a very creepy atmosphere a great eerie score and an excellent cast starring Christopher Lee as Dracula Herbert Lom as Van Helsing and Klaus Kinski as Renfield.As mentioned above this movie is probably the most loyal adaption of Bram Stoker's novel so I don't suppose a further plot description is necessary. I am a huge fan of the Hammer Dracula flicks and the 1958 Dracula is one of my alltime favorite movies. Although this Jess Franco version of the story differs entirely from these great classics of British Horror this is a highly atmospheric creepy and original flick that must not be missed by a Horror fan.Christopher Lee is as always brilliant in the role of Dracula. The prince of darkness is wearing a mustache this time one more aspect in which this movie is loyal to the novel. Herbert Lom is a great actor and fits very well in the role of an elderly Van Helsing although my personal opinion is that he can't compete with Peter Cushing who will always be unmatched in the role of Van Helsing he played in the Hammer films. Last but not least Klaus Kinski delivers a brilliant performance as Renfield. Kinski was predestined to play madmen and the particular role of Renfield fits this great actor perfectly. The cast furthermore includes Paul Muller Nightmare Castle and beautiful Maria Rohm and Soledad Miranda and the gloominess of the atmosphere is even increased by the great eerie score composed by Bruno Nicolai. Count Dracula has a few cheesy moments too but all things considered this is another great Dracula flick starring Lee and definitely one of the best films directed by Jess Franco. Highly recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a fan of horror throughout my entire life introduced to Dracula in the late 1960's I've always been fascinated by the Vampire mythos itself as much as the theatrical interpretations of those legends. While I believe Bela will always be the actor most commonly associated with the role I also believe that Lee was the BEST Dracula.Unfortunately this director considers himself to be an arthouse worthy stylist when in actuality he ends up wasting at least 15 minutes of every film with his arthouse shots which are usually superfluous and lend nothing whatsoever to the plot he is supposed to be shooting.Fortunately this time he didn't bother with that mindless activity and delivers an awesome bit of horror. Is this the best Dracula MOVIE? Well not in my opinion. I'm one of those storygreat effects over atmosphere horror fans so in my book the best Dracula movie so far has been John Carpenter's Vampires because the effects were mind blowing and the story was just plain GOOD.So why am I reviewing THIS movie? Simply because Lee's performance more than rates your time. If you are a Lee fan or if you're a Dracula fan or if you're a horror fan in general this movie is worth the 2 hours' viewing time just to take in Lee's brilliance. As I've said in my opinion this is by far his best performance. Loved him as Sauron but this is still his best. Check it out if only for Lee's Performance. You won't be disappointed.It rates an 8.810 from...the Fiend .".

Of note is Christopher Lee's Dracula costumed and made up almost directly in line with the book. His portrayal is equally good if a bit flat at times.At a certain point though the narrative deviates. Several characters are omitted from this adaptation and parts of the plot change significantly from the novel. However much of the sexual undertones of the original novel seep through regardless which is almost expected given director Jess Franco's experience with adultoriented films. Some parts of the new narrative also fall flat resulting in at least two notable wallbanger moments but overall it makes sense and is still somewhat similar to the novel.Also of note is Klaus Kinski's portrayal of Renfield not the best that honor goes to Dwight Frye in the 1931 adaptation but mysterious and welldone nonetheless. In addition Herbert Lom does well as Dracula's foe Van Helsing especially given later events in the narrative and Lee's statement that they were never actually filmed together on the same set.Some other bad parts of the film include the aforementioned wallbanger scenes Franco's obsession with shaky camera zooming and some cheaply done special effects and sets.These don't necessarily detract from the film however and it remains an enjoyable if definitely flawed film.

	schema:headline " Very well done by all concerned.";
	schema:reviewBody "Count Dracula is the legendary Jess Franco's stylish and opulent looking adaptation of the enduring Bram Stoker tale done in such a way as to create a true sense of foreboding right from the outset. Not only does it look great but it's beautifully atmospheric and elegant and may appeal to lovers of classic vampire tales by keeping exploitative elements to a minimum. There are beautiful women and there's a tiny bit of gore but Franco mostly makes this film all about the ambiance. Plus it's hard to go wrong with any film that casts Sir Christopher Lee in the role of the nefarious Count a dozen years after he'd began essaying the role in Hammer's Dracula series Herbert Lom as the intrepid Van Helsing who doesn't let a stroke deter him from doing what needs to be done and the oneofakind Klaus Kinski perfectly suited to the role of the disturbed Renfield but actually playing the role with a little more restraint than one might expect. The familiar story has lawyer in training Jonathan Harker handsome Fred Williams visiting the aged Count in his Transylvanian castle as the latter prepares to make the move to London and the efforts of Jonathan Van Helsing and Quincey Morris Jack Taylor to vanquish the Count once they realize they have a problem. Franco gives his film a wonderfully ominous mood which he maintains for 97 straight minutes and creates some haunting sequences such as Lucy's Soledad Miranda seduction of a child. Speaking of Ms. Miranda it would also be hard to knock any film featuring such a lovely lady as well as the equally delectable Maria Rohm as Mina. The period recreation is strong the pacing efficient Bruno Mattei is one of the two editors and the music by Bruno Nicolai simply excellent. Mainly though the film serves as a fine showcase for the always dapper and always charismatic Lee who gives Dracula a measure of dignity he has one impressive monologue done in closeup as he relates some family history as well as menace. Colourful sinister and featuring interesting touches such as animal noises on the soundtrack as Jonathan and Quincey are surrounded by stuffed animals at one point Count Dracula is worth a viewing for fans of old fashioned fright fare. Eight out of 10.".

The period recreation is strong the pacing efficient Bruno Mattei is one of the two editors and the music by Bruno Nicolai simply excellent. Mainly though the film serves as a fine showcase for the always dapper and always charismatic Lee who gives Dracula a measure of dignity he has one impressive monologue done in closeup as he relates some family history as well as menace. Colourful sinister and featuring interesting touches such as animal noises on the soundtrack as Jonathan and Quincey are surrounded by stuffed animals at one point Count Dracula is worth a viewing for fans of old fashioned fright fare. Eight out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "In 1922 German filmmaker F. W. Murnau failed to get rights to film Bram Stoker's novel Dracula and so he made many changes in his vampire film Nosferatu. In 1931 the most famous Dracula film starring Bela Lugosi was released. Instead of the book it was more based on a famous theater play. In 1958 Hammer Films released its first Dracula film that was a greatly simplified version of the story. Christopher Lee who continued to play the part of Count Dracula in many of Hammer's sequels often complained that writers didn't use any of the great scenes andor dialog from Stoker's novel. In 196970 a Spanish cfilmmaker Jess Franco or Jesus Franco agreed with Lee and begun to plan filming an authentic movie version of Stoker's book. Delighted Lee agreed to play the part in his film.Franco's film El Conde Dracula a.k.a. Count Dracula Nachts wenn Dracula erwacht Verenhimoinen Dracula etc. has a very promising beginning. Although film is shot in Spain Franco has found very Gothic looking places where to shot the film and on the background we hear Bruno Nicolai's powerful organ music. Jonathan Harker's Fred Williams journey to Dracula's castle follows Stoker's pages faithfully and Lee looks stunning with the white hair and mustache Dracula appears as an old man for the first time in cinema history. When he starts speaking Stoker's lines about Dracula's past and passionately tell how Dracula's ancestors defeated Turks you can see Lee is having a time of his life finally playing Dracula as he wanted.Sadly the first 20 minutes are also mainly the only good ones in this film. Apparently the producers backed out suddenly and Franco lost most of his budget. He has tried to keep most of his film faithful to Stoker but the lack of money has forced them to make changes. After Harker escapes from Dracula's castle he wakes up weeks later in a hospital ran by Prof. Abraham Van Helsing Herbert Lom and Dr. John Seward Paul Muller. Soon Harker's fiance Mina Maria Rohm arrives with her friend Lucy beautiful Soledad Miranda and her fianc Quincey Morris Jack Taylor. Count Dracula has moved to an old abbey very close to a hospital and his presence has an odd effect on Van Helsing's patient Renfield Klaus Kinski who actually played Dracula later in 1979.As said Franco tries to keep the film as faithful to Stoker as he can. However dreams of making a completely authentic adaptation were gone. Also the film is far from being even a good film. Poor supporting performances Franco's annoying habit of taking many closeup shots and the general lack of money are too visible effects to ignore. Also after the castle sequence Lee doesn't have much to do anymore. He does get younger which is interesting to see but he mainly just gives threatening glares. Herbert Lom who has played different roles from Captain Nemo to Phantom of the Opera is the saving grace here. His Van Helsing becomes the only interesting character here and Lom does put his best to the role stealing the rest of the film from others. Klaus Kinski sadly just wastes his talents here for he has no lines at all. Story tells that producer Harry Allan Towers would have tricked Kinski in the film by not telling him it's a Dracula film. Franco has denied this though.Jesus Franco's El Conde Dracula is the first movie really trying to be faithful to Stoker's book. Unfortunately it doesn't reach it goals and is not even that great movie in the first place. God only knows that they might have done a lot better with more money. Now the only things memorable are performances by Lee and Lom as well as the organ music.".

	schema:reviewBody "Franco's take on the Bram Stoker novel with Christopher Lee again portraying Count Dracula except this production..a meager one at best with Franco admitting in a recent interview that he had to front his own financing to finish the film!is completely subdued from the acting to the presentation. Director Jess Franco does exploit an obsession of his in this film..his love for the use of a zooming camera lens. During moments of dialogue Jess Franco loves for his camera's eye to hone in on the faces of his casts and even lingers on the mouth of Dracula as his fangs become slightly visible. I do think that this technique can work but to be honest Jess Franco does tend to go overboard a bit. It does seem like he has inferior equipment..his camera at times seems to have the jitters and the focus  color occasionally obscure. But I liked this film much more than I thought I would. I love the opening sequence with an elder Dracula welcoming Harker into his decadent castle. Dracula looks overwrought from the dead atmosphere of his ancestral home where he belovedly speaks with passion and authority about his proud family and how they fought and won wars bravely. Yet in that castle he remains and I think that you can see it through Lee a relic of a begone era. The blood of those in a completely different place far removed from home will bring the youth he seeks. Like always Lee can merely open a door and you stand at attention. That whole scene in his castle before venturing off to seek fresh victims elsewhere nearby Van Helsing's mental institution is probably my favorite of the film because it brings something different to the oftfilmed character establishing this version of Dracula performed by Lee as more than just a bloodsucker. If only Franco had been able to afford better special effects. He does use the location of Barcelona impeccably. I would've enjoyed a better confrontation between Lee and Lom but to see them..along with Kinski and Mirandain the same film even if they were often filmed separately is enough pleasure for me.For a long period of time in my youth I only knew Lom primarily as Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus the constant recipient of aggravation from Peter Seller's bumbling Inspector Clouseau. Since watching more 60's  early 70's horror I've come to find Lom an icon of the genre. He can hold you captive with his mere presence just as Lee. He's not as much a theatrical actor as this authoritative commanding figure who draws you to him like a moth to the flame. I didn't mind Franco's constant zooming towards Lom's face because he has always delivers something interesting with his Van Helsing character. Lom is formidable and this really bodes well because there is a good portion of the film where Lee's Count is away from the screen. I think in order to hold the viewer's interest..or those who want to see Lee all the time it's important to cast other interesting actors. This leads me to Klaus Kinski. I have to admit that I wasn't expecting this type of interpretation from Kinski as the often dementedly performed character of Renfield. Klaus I don't think ever finishes a complete sentence preferring to show the terror on Renfield's face as he slowly awaits the arrival of Dracula. Even within a padded cell you can see through the facial mannerisms and hypnotic blue eyes of Kinski Renfield's plight. Unlike past interpretations of Renfield Kinski doesn't deliver deranged monologues about the Count but channels the horrors of what he knows through silence..often seen staring almost mimelike in how he makes for the window of his cell as it faces the mansion with which his enemy residesand gesture. Soledad Miranda's exotic beauty is definitely put to good use as Lucy Dracula's chosen source of blood. Fred Williams as Lucy's fianc Jonathan Harker and Jack Taylor as Mina's fianc Quincy Morris are more or less secondary characters. They're important as vampire hunters urged by Van Helsing to stop Dracula before he can harm other innocents. The lovely Maria RohmVenus in Furshas the role of Mina but she is used mainly on screen to scream when she sees Dracula.".

Whats this? I cried literally Juicy flies and spiders!? What happened to the script? Was there a script? Would it have helped? A good film is the result of many things writing lighting production even actors have been known to add to the overall effect.

The movie sees Count Dracula played by the legend that is Christopher Lee flee his Carpathian Castle in Transylvania for the shores of England where he is desperate to feed on the blood of English women Lucy and Mina in order to grow youthful and remain alive. Unfortunately for Dracula however having everything go his way is not as easy as he had hoped as good guys Professor Abraham Van Helsing Jonathan Harker Quincey Morris and Dr John Seward soon learn of what Dracula is up to and set out to stop him. As well as being quite possibly the best and most faithful movie adaptation of Bram Stokers novel this movie is also the most serious available this in terms of story script directing and acting. There thankfully isn't any over the top performances here.

All of the all star cast pull off fantastic acting performances in particular Christopher Lee and Herbert Lom. Christopher Lee also provides his best performance as Dracula in this movie better than the more over the top Hammer Dracula performances and many will find it a treat to see Christopher Lee delivering Bram Stoker's dialogue word for word in particular the 'children of the night' speech. The atmosphere throughout this movie is incredible as are the sets and music which is performed by the brilliant Bruno Nicolai. The only downfall concerning this movie in my opinion is the budget which was obviously low and this shows when it comes to the rather embarrassing scene when the stuffed animals come to life and are supposedly attempting to attack Harker Morris and Seward. Overall Jess Franco's version of Count Dracula is a very good movie and if you are a fan of Dracula movies then this is one movie that your collection should not be without.".

	schema:headline " Perhaps one of the finest Mexican horror flicks...ever";
	schema:reviewBody "Nowadays I am rather bored with the same movies about spiteful little ghosts of teenage girls or resentful children who want to give someone a message or simply punish their murderers. Especially if we are talking about those Asian movies that always have a similar ending. Don't get the wrong idea about me I am not trying to be rude or offensive but horror movies nowadays tend to be way too similar when it comes to the whole vindictive ghost subject matter. Obviously it is almost impossible not to base a movie on prior ideas and that is not the blameworthy thing I'm trying to point out. Basically what really annoys me about contemporary ghost flicks is that they try so hard to shock the audience or provide something new that they usually end up messing it up and worst of all the ending is still predictable. At least that is my humble opinion. Fortunately we can always rely on a good horror gem from many years ago and that is the case of Hasta el viento tiene miedo. A simple and yet stylish horror movie that provides all the necessary elements without trying so desperately to fill an hour and a half. It may be a little bit predictable in a way but at least it's highly enjoyable and it doesn't try to mislead the audience with pitiful and superfluous situations. In Hasta el viento tiene miedo a group of boarding school girls suffer from the torments of a authoritarian and conniving headmistress called Bernarda who seems to unload of all her anger on the girls. In contrast Lucia the viceheadmistress tries to be as easygoing as possible to make up for Bernarda's unkind behavior earning that way the girls' friendliness One night Claudia a student from the boarding school suffers from a nightmare in which she hears a ghostly voice that calls her name from the heights of a tower that is situated in the school garden. When she goes in and walks up the stairs she opens a red door and finds the body of a blonde girl hanging from the ceiling. Claudia's classmates become so fascinated with that dreadful nightmare that they all go together to the tower to reveal the mystery even though Mrs. Bernarda had forbidden the girls to go up there. Before they can reveal any mysteries the headmistress arrives and catches the girls who were trying to disobey her rules. As a consequence all the girls are punished and forced to spend their winter vacations at the boarding school. Furious with their headmistress all the girls complain about their vacations without realizing that something even more awful is about to happen. There's a ghost seeking for revenge and one of them is going to be chosen as a messenger and living avenger.Hasta el viento tiene miedo is a well made Gothic horror gem that not only frightens more than once but also offers a lot of amusing scenes that work as some kind of humorous relief without turning the whole movie into a comedy. Naughty winks and yet nave situations that probably caused a little bit of controversy back in the 60s when the film came out. For example the scene in which the illdisciplined and naughty student named Kitty performs a striptease for her classmates and teaches them how to do it I think that's one of my favorites. Not so much because of the striptease itself but mostly because the other girls look at her as if she was killing someone right in front of their eyes. There's also the scene in which all the girls force the prude girl to dance along with them and then jump all over her like barbarians and take off her clothes as a way of revenge for being such a gossipy. The chemistry between actresses who played the schoolgirls some of them were almost in their 30s was simply flawless. Marga Lopez as the evil headmistress probably offered one of the best performances in this film. Her character Mrs. Bernarda reminded me of those days when I used to go to school and I would feel a shiver up from down my spine every time I saw an intimidating teacher or headmistress. Definitely not a pleasant feeling which means she did a good job. The well known Mexican composer Armando Manzanero was in charge of the music which is also an extra point. His work is also one of the main elements that contributes to make this film so atmospheric. Hasta el viento tiene miedo probably even delivers a hidden message regarding the severity of school authorities back then and the fact that violence can only produce more violence. Now the question is is there really a hidden message or am I just overreacting and giving the film more credit than it deserves?. I suppose that's up to each one to decide. Either way hidden message or not I highly recommend this film.".

Even without being aware of it because many of us as merely spectators at least me and some other persons I've spoken to didn't realize for many years that El libro de piedra 1968 and Ms negro que la noche 1975 were part of Taboada's film history.Though i dig more El libro de piedra to a level as considering it his masterpiece Hasta el viento tiene miedo Even the wind's scared it's such a powerful ghost story that happens in a boarding school for girls. Since the beginning the film warns you about what you're going to see because of a creepy start that involves a sleepwalking girl on the outside in a windy night attending a call made by another girl from the bell tower of the school's chappel. She starts climbing upstairs and the next thing you see it's a pair of hanging feet and the sleepwalker awakening in a scream. Even on these days the memories of the voice chanting like wind Claudia Claudia in a whispering full of anguish gives me the creeps. The first half of this story is told in such a brilliant way that can only be surpassed by El libro de piedra in a whole with good acting by names like Marga Lpez Norma Lazareno and Maricruz Olivier Hasta el viento... moves around a girl whose dead a bunch of brat student girls and a mean school director. As I said before the first half is brilliant in many ways. Taboada surely knew the sources of primal fear and took them to cinema extends making you jump with scenes that has the ability to caught unaware or leading tension into almost unbearable levels. Hope you can see it some time because it's well worth the feelings of anguish and fear caused by the sense of terror that we're led into while watching. Unfortunately the second half falls on it's lap as a formulaic chain of events that leads to a clich ending.Even so most of Hasta el viento... it's a live picture of Taboada's art. He knew how to grab you by the neck and never let go. With his movies you can feel the greatest fear running all over the body and you don't want to stop watching anyway. That was and still is magic it was great cinema that depended only on the subconscious manipulation of terror. In fact I owe Taboadas some of the greatest fears from my childhood like never watching at the curtain's end at night or to a window when there's a storm.".

	schema:reviewBody "While not as prolific as the USA UK and Italy Mexico is responsible for many great horror films with the sixties in particular being something of a goldmine for the horror fan. Carlos Enrique Taboada's Hasta el viento tiene miedo has a great reputation amongst those who have seen it and after having finally tracked the film down myself I have to say that its reputation is completely deserved! The title translates into English as 'Even the Wind is Afraid' and as you would expect from a film with such a title this is a macabre treat! Like the classics The House That Screamed and Suspiria this film focuses on an allgirl boarding house. After a group of girls sneak into a restricted part of the school and are caught their punishment doled out by the head teacher nicknamed 'The Witch' is that they have to stay behind during the summer break! Naturally the girls are not too pleased and things take a turn for the worse when a long dead student is sighted during the heavy winds and seems to be after a student named Claudia...The story is very much of the slow burn variety and while we do get plenty of horror the film focuses more on building the characters their relationships and the central situation. The horror is brought forward more through atmosphere and while the locations used are not as Gothic as those seen in similar Italian films the film does deliver a great air of creepiness and the way that the wind is used provides one of the main highlights. The acting is very good with adult performers Marga Lpez and Maricruz Olivier delivering the standout performances as the two teachers. The younger performers are all very nice looking and while the acting is sometimes a bit cheesy it doesn't harm the film too much. The plot does move slowly but it's always interesting and the film builds tension as we get closer to the end with the film taking a rather unexpected twist half way through. It all boils down to an engaging and original for the time climax and overall Hasta el viento tiene miedo may not be one of the best known horror films ever made but it will certainly be of interest to horror fans.

The whole Gothic atmosphere including settings score art direction and cinematography is simply stunning. This is a visually stunning Horror movie mainly because of Taboada's direction. It's really sad that he is heavily underrated although he made among Mxico's creepiest Horror movies. The movie relies it's creepiness on the settings Gothic and the shocking factor on the usual scary images that pop out of nowhere. For example when the girls are dancing along with the piano music and Kitty is performing a striptease the ghost of Andrea appears through the window and scares the hell out of the girls. That was a chilling scene that nobody expects. And there are more shockingscary scenes through the movie. But that isn't the best feature of the movie. The atmosphere is what makes this a worth watch. The performances are simply great. Although it's obvious that the main characters were picked up because of their physical beauty. Nice move!Marga LpezR.I.P. in the role of Bernarda is simply fantastic. She demonstrates why she's considered one of the top 5 actresses in the history of Mxico. Her performance is solid believable and truly gains the audience's dislike. When she had to be strict or bitchy she did it very well and when she had to look worried scared or demonstrate sorrow she was also great. Alicia Bonet Claudia gave a strong performance as the naive well behaved heroine. She was very cute but brave at the same time. Norma Lazareno Kitty stole the show as the rebel sexual Kitty. She paved the road for the dead end girl type character like PJ Soles in Halloween or Margot Kidder in Black Christmas very influenced by Lazareno's performance. The rest of the cast was great. Diego Lucia portrayed perfectly by Maricruz Olivier Josefina Carolina Liliana and even Armando deliver great performances. You can feel the excellent chemistry between all the characters. The result is that you feel sympathy for them. You will probably find the acting to be cheesy at some points but that is because Mexican acting at the time was heavily inspired by dramatic theater plays. Mexican acting tends to be over the top at some points and this is no exception. But the onscreen charm and chemistry between the characters saves the day. Hasta el Viento Tiene Miedo is a pioneer in the genre and probably among Mxico's best Horrors movie to date. There's no need of gore or fx in order to create a scary creepy and moving Horror movie. Hasta El Viento Tiene MIedo succeeds on every possible aspect. You can't get much better from any ghost movie. I have a strong recommendation Watch the movie before reading it's plot summary and don't let anyone spoil it for you. The first viewing experience worths your time. For it's time I'm sure it was a truly scary experience. It may not be scary enough for today's standards but definitely it still has the touch.".

At night when the wind whistles.....This film is a horror film with touches of comedy and it manages to create a good supernatural atmosphere night the wind blowing the leaves trembling the tower... It reminded me somehow of Werewolf in a Girls' Dormitory an ItaloAustrian film made in 1961 that also took place in a girls boarding school. But Hasta el viento tiene miedo is the better film. Hasta el viento.. tells the story in a very straightforward way no room for ambiguity is left so it becomes predictable and this takes away some of the film's edge. The girls though are very charming and add eye candy to the film.You can't compare it to the Italian Gothic films  by Bava Margheriti Freda Caiano.. with their visual grandeur lighting decors camera work .. and their magnificent soundtracks.Anyway Hasta el viento.... is an interesting film  I think that it won't scare the modern viewer but it offers in return a wellcrafted atmosphere with touches of suspense and comedy. It is charmingly naive and romantic. It was released in Mexico in 30 May 1968. Some months later a hard wind blew and even the wind was afraid.".

After all girls see the ghost her beloved teacher Lucia tells them that the hanged woman was Andrea a former student who had committed suicide five years earlier because she was punished the same way the girls were and doesn't have the chance to go see her dying mother her only living relative. After possessing Claudia the spirit of Andrea seeks revenge and hangs the principal.Aside the final scene with the swimming pool that appears to have thrown in because of the time just to see girls on swimsuits all the movie has memorable cuts of truly suspense scenes. Andrea appearing in front of the students and in the top window of the cellar. The scene of teacher Lucia with gardener Diego Have you seen her?! Yes...you don't?. The piano and heliotrope scene when Bernarda starts to believe. The bird scene and...well all the movie up to the few last scenes. Some other reviewers said that after 55 minutes after the possession of Claudia or so the movie is awesome but afterward was all clich. I disagree.

Now that it is over I do not see what all the fuss is about. Perhaps one has to see Hasta el Viento Tiene Miedo young before watching many horror movies. Otherwise it is just not an especially memorable horror movie. The first problem is the film's slow pace. The first fortyfive or fifty minutes is all set up. It's a lot of wind blowing cats jumping out and did you see that strange girl type discussions. All of this becomes tedious after awhile. The film does not produce any surprises or action until its final third. By that time many viewers have given up.A second problem is the tameness of the whole film. I do realize that a ghost story is built upon mood and atmosphere rather than shock scenes but really this is a horror film for one's grandmother. I find the film's scares all old hat for 1968. That was the year of Night of the Living Dead the year of Targets the year of Naked You Die a much better school girl mystery.Hasta el Viento Tiene Miedo does have a few surprises. The film takes an unexpected turn in the final third. The striptease scene is colorful and sexy in a PG way. There is also some nice interaction between the girls. Despite these pluses the film is not worth the time. The movie is further ill served by a flat ending. Those interested in seeing a late 1960's mystery set at a girl's school would be better off checking out Naked You Die or The House that Screamed from 1969.".

He also understands the genre very well he knows that in movies like these the special effects wont be effective he knows that characters mood and execution are priorities.

All the young female actresses are EXCELLENT each playing the perfect part especially Kitty Norma Lazareno doing her trashy strip tease which almost steals the show!! Leading the scary roll is Claudia Alica Bonet possessed by the ghost of Andrea played by the beautiful Pamela Susan Hall. Oddly enough she did not pursue a career in movies. The rest of the young girls continue acting in Mexican soaps and movies to this day. Interestingly there are only 3 male actors with the story since the story deals with a private school for girls. The screechy owl on the tree the haunting sounds and the whistlingeerie wind are scary enough to scare anyone. The final touch to the movie that everyone is forgetting is the great spooky music. Most of the special effects are done in camera no digital or cheesy effects here. I have bought this DVD and always look forward to seeing it again and again. Somehow we like to be scared once in a while. Great Halloween flick. You don't have to be bilingual to understand the story.".

	schema:headline " Yeah I felt a little walled in myself";
	schema:reviewBody "Walled In is the kind of horror film that sets itself up in a bizarre location and then explains all kinds of bizarre rules to make the scariness work. The movie opens with a series of headlines that explain the terrible discovery of 16 bodies cemented into the walls of a building including that of the architect who designed it. We learn that the person who walled them in Joseph Malestrazza was never caught and then we cut to 15 years later when the building is planned to be demolished.Mischa Barton stars as Samantha a young member of the demolition company family perfectly named the Walczak's the 'c' is silent. She recently graduated from engineering school and it becomes her first lone assignment to visit the building and supervise its demolition. It's a perfect setup for a horror movie I suppose although as soon as we get to the building the one where the 16 bodies were discovered you remember and learn that the wife and son of the murdered architect are still living there the movie takes a pretty serious turn for the worse. I would think that if a man suffered the terrible fate of being murdered and cemented into the walls of a building his wife would take it upon herself not to raise their son for his entire life in that building. But that's me.Upon her arrival we meet the woman living there and her creepy son who explains things to Samantha that the lights go off every six minutes to conserve energy she shouldn't go to the 8th floor that's Malestrazza's quarters you see and it's never cleaned and whatever you do don't go on the roof! I would think that someone planning the demolition of a building would explain the logical deficiency of avoiding certain parts of it but we understand that this is a horror movie and these goofy rules he's explaining are a setup for freaky sequences that are to follow. There's also the issue of a few remaining people who lived in the building and who are not likely to appreciate Sam arriving to destroy it. The young boy also worries that Malestrazza will be offended by her plans.I was reminded of the brilliant novel House of Leaves in a lot of things about the movie. Sam discovers enormous discrepancies between the blueprints and the actual measurements of the house which in that book led to a fascinating and frightening series of events but in the movie leads to the cheap and utterly witless third act. There is also a lot of throwbacks to Psycho in the relationship between the young boy and his mother in an isolated location. Sam even describes the building as being like the Bates Motel only bigger and at one point the mother forbids her son to go near Sam telling him that Sa could never take care of him the way she does. Creepy.Ultimately we learn about an ancient architectural belief that provides the reason that Malestrazza killed people and walled them into his buildings and also the reason why not one of the 27 buildings that Malestrazza built have ever been torn down. It gives the movie the feel of something with more thought in it that it actually has. I felt a little flicker of interest when this was revealed but in retrospect it strikes me as little more than a screenwriters brainstorm. I understand that Walled In is based on a novel and I hope the novel is better than the movie. Books especially horror books are always better than the movie ad if someone read the book and thought it was good enough to make into a film it must have been better than this movie because it has all the signposts of a weak horror film. It's full to the brim with cheap scares notice the Screeching Cat Scare which at least was made a little bit different but essentially is the same old thing and my favorite a scary rose scare. You have to see that one to believe it and blatantly rips off a whole series of other horror movies. I'm curious what the movie would have looked like had director Gilles PaquetBrenner never seen Psycho Texas Chainsaw and the Nightmare on Elm Street films. He even uses that One Two Freddy's Coming For You song several times. Real creative there buddy.I won't go into the details of the end of the film partly because I don't want to ruin it for you but mostly because it's so dumb that I don't want to bother spending my time explaining it. I will tell you one thing though. There's a particularly amusing scene where the boy accuses Samantha of thinking that he's nothing but a crazy little boy. You gotta see this scene man it's hilarious. At the time that he says that to her I won't tell you what he happens to be doing but when you make a statement like that it's generally not a good time to be acting like a crazy little boy. What follows that scene is a third act that is not entirely without effect but definitely one of the dumbest situations that I've seen in a horror movie in some years. It is so bizarre and makes so little sense that the movie almost becomes a mystery. Another mystery is why the thing got made in the first place but sadly after seeing the movie I don't think I'm every going to be able to bring myself to read the book".

	onyx:emotionText "Walled In is the kind of horror film that sets itself up in a bizarre location and then explains all kinds of bizarre rules to make the scariness work. The movie opens with a series of headlines that explain the terrible discovery of 16 bodies cemented into the walls of a building including that of the architect who designed it. We learn that the person who walled them in Joseph Malestrazza was never caught and then we cut to 15 years later when the building is planned to be demolished.Mischa Barton stars as Samantha a young member of the demolition company family perfectly named the Walczak's the 'c' is silent. She recently graduated from engineering school and it becomes her first lone assignment to visit the building and supervise its demolition. It's a perfect setup for a horror movie I suppose although as soon as we get to the building the one where the 16 bodies were discovered you remember and learn that the wife and son of the murdered architect are still living there the movie takes a pretty serious turn for the worse. I would think that if a man suffered the terrible fate of being murdered and cemented into the walls of a building his wife would take it upon herself not to raise their son for his entire life in that building. But that's me.Upon her arrival we meet the woman living there and her creepy son who explains things to Samantha that the lights go off every six minutes to conserve energy she shouldn't go to the 8th floor that's Malestrazza's quarters you see and it's never cleaned and whatever you do don't go on the roof! I would think that someone planning the demolition of a building would explain the logical deficiency of avoiding certain parts of it but we understand that this is a horror movie and these goofy rules he's explaining are a setup for freaky sequences that are to follow. There's also the issue of a few remaining people who lived in the building and who are not likely to appreciate Sam arriving to destroy it. The young boy also worries that Malestrazza will be offended by her plans.I was reminded of the brilliant novel House of Leaves in a lot of things about the movie. Sam discovers enormous discrepancies between the blueprints and the actual measurements of the house which in that book led to a fascinating and frightening series of events but in the movie leads to the cheap and utterly witless third act. There is also a lot of throwbacks to Psycho in the relationship between the young boy and his mother in an isolated location. Sam even describes the building as being like the Bates Motel only bigger and at one point the mother forbids her son to go near Sam telling him that Sa could never take care of him the way she does. Creepy.Ultimately we learn about an ancient architectural belief that provides the reason that Malestrazza killed people and walled them into his buildings and also the reason why not one of the 27 buildings that Malestrazza built have ever been torn down. It gives the movie the feel of something with more thought in it that it actually has.

The first 2030 minutes of the movie is actually pretty good but I'll save you the time by saying that it went downhill FAST. I'll give you perspective that the budget of a film means nothing to me. Sure I love the special effects that make the bigbudget films soar and help tell the story but I like the lowbudget indie films just as well provided it tells a good story. This film has neither. When they started to rush they lost the viewer by getting off track and seemingly changing the actual story line making it confusing wobblypaced and completely destroying the story.

Many current horror titles are very uninspired and frankly rely too much on gore and not enough on story or atmosphere.

I love horror movies especially ones that rely more on imagination and atmosphere this one does to an extent but then focuses on the human element and becomes more of a thriller in this I felt a little cheated.The building which is the object of the movie is simply a nice piece of Gothic deco art. Sinister and yet elegant in its simplicity huge and monstrous in its presence. The premise works in the beginning and the actors do not disappoint. It is suggestion that works here as well as a psychological drama that is as twisted as an abnormal Mother and son relationship and dark secrets of the past mingled with arcane knowledge of the architecture of forbidden temples. Sadly though I wished for more emphasis on the later aspect it held my interest and fascination but it veered into a film about a demented teenage crush. If more time had been spent on the architect his history and theories as well as the previous murders then the chill factor would have been amped up. The building should have been the real star here and its creator and to a large extent it is yet it slowly is pushed into the background and dwarfed by a teenager's obsession and some of the dwellings rather seemed to be almost inconsistent in their art direction. The inhabited dwellings almost seemed cheap bland compared to the overall presence of the building. It caused a sense of confusion perhaps intentional. Enjoyable yet flawed and could have been developed into a much richer film. It is still a fun view. I hope the director continues with the genre though this film has its flaws the director has potential.".

	schema:reviewBody "Walled In definitely looked like a horror movie with massive potential and several aspects about the synopsis immediately appealed to me like the guaranteed horrific theme of claustrophobic death isolated buildings with a macabre past lunatic architects and a slowly unfolding serial killer plot. I became even more convinced of the potential after witnessing the terrifically uncanny opening sequence in which a small child is trapped between four walls and screaming her lungs out whilst cement slowly filling up the concrete grave. This is a harsh and nightmarish sequence that you don't expect to see in modern day horror movie so I started to feel very confident this could become a gem of a film. Unfortunately I shouted victory way too early again as the walls of the productions literally come crashing down promptly after the opening credits. The screenplay is adapted from a graphic novel written by Canadian writer Serge Brussolo and I certainly don't doubt the idea makes an absorbing book but the film version is unstructured confusing preposterous and utterly implausible. Furthermore the film itself is extremely unpleasant to look at what with its grainy photography grim ambiance and vile characterizations. Walled In is one of those movies that make you nervous and uncomfortable without actually scaring anyone so I was really glad when it was over. Sam Walczak is a freshly graduated engineer and the heiress of her family's destruction company. Her father offers her the opportunity to be in charge of her very own project organizing and supervising the demolition of a remote and sinister apartment building originally designed by the notoriously eccentric architect Joseph Malestrazza. The building has a dark past as reputedly over 15 previous tenants were entombed in the walls and Sam quickly experiences there's truth in the rumors. Together with the slightly offbeat teenage son of the evicted caretaker she develops a theory that the mysteriously vanished architect might still be entrenched in the building. Pretentious and lethargic Walled In is basically a totally absurd movie with an overload of transparent red herring and atmosphere building elements that are boldly stolen from other and much better genre classics. The ending is downright pathetic and actually a direct insult on the viewer's intelligence. Don't expect any gore or bloodshed neither just a whole lot of wannabe shocking undertones leading absolutely nowhere. The performances are very much below par and the overall conclusion regarding the film is simply put embarrassing. If these walls could talk  they would advise us to throw all copies of this movie in a hole in the basement and subsequently blow up the building.".

The only reason she explains to Sam that they stay in the apartment is because Mary feels close to her husband's spirit.

She is sent on her first assignment to a building from an eccentric architect Joseph Malestrazza who cemented the bodies of people into his walls including himself. This allegedly gives the building immortality which is a bit of a problem when you're in charge of demolishing it. In the battle between demolition expert and spiritual architecture who can win?I watched this film and found myself let down after the first ten minutes. I enjoyed the opening scene with a young girl becoming part of the building  more scenes like this would have sold the film  and the credits over newspaper articles detailing horrific murders tied to the building. But the remainder of the film just flopped and dragged like a captured fish out of water and to say what I would say and say it better I defer to the reviews of Michael DeZubiria and Horror.Com's Staci Layne Wilson. I am reluctant to encourage readers to venture from Killer Reviews but these are excellent writers. Wilson touches on all the right allusions hinting that Walled In has aspects of Argento Poe Roeg Polanski and Cocteau  names you don't just throw around. DeZubiria compares the story in some respects to Mark Z. Danielewski's unique 2000 novel House of Leaves. But Wilson is right when she says the directing plays it safe and falls short of all these looming figures and the accompanying cinematography is not very innovative which is unfortunate for a film set in a building as interestingly bizarre as this one. DeZubiria flatly states that Walled In blatantly rips off a whole series of other horror movies.Wilson and DeZubiria both find the film discourages rather than encourages reading of the original book  Serge Brussolo's novel Les Emmeures. Wilson says the movie quelled my curiosity and DeZubiria bluntly says the book must have been better than this movie but I don't think I'm ever going to be able to bring myself to read the book. As I found the plot to be largely a rehashing of Thirteen Ghosts and the storyline as given in the film to be boring I have to concur  the book is likely better than the film but doesn't seem worth my time to seek out.DeZubiria doesn't reveal the end but says it's so dumb that I don't want to bother spending my time explaining it and that's a fair assessment. I seriously had a difficult time sitting through half the movie it was a bit of cinematic torture to make it to the end. The making of featurette doesn't help or add any value to the DVD. Wilson rightly says it's nothing more than backpatting. If you want to see the cast and crew congratulate themselves on a boring movie be my guest. But I think these two reviewers got it right  there are many other authors and directors who deserve to have their films appreciated. Read and watch those novels and films and leave this one to be quickly forgotten in your local video store's discount bin.".

	schema:reviewBody "At first I thought that Walled In would be a pretty good movie. The opening scene was great but as soon as I heard the voice over I was thinking that the movie might not represent the novel well. When a movie is based on a book written in first person it's normally filled with voice overs of the narrator's constant thoughts. Sort of like Twilight.It wasn't that good. Really. Twenty minutes in I kept thinking how exaggerated and bad Mischa Barton's acting was. She kept reciting her lines awkwardly and it had no flow. The emphasis on her words made it feel like maybe she wasn't listening and she's just saying everything randomly. However towards the ending her acting got better. But that's only because she was screaming most of the time and I gave her the benefit of the doubt that maybe her character Samantha's just a bad liar.The plot itself was confusing and it made the entire movie seem like the most interesting thing there was the building. They put in a million random shots that were left unexplained and then gave some kind of random solution at the end. An example of this is the mother's crazy talk to Jimmy's father. That was answered by the fact that she was talking about Malestrazza. But it still didn't answer whether or not she meant to put him there. I mean it WAS his tomb. He WANTED to be there.Were there any ghosts in there? Was Malestrazza psychic? I certainly don't know. Sam kept hearing voices and Malestrazza was really weird. It became hard to tell whether or not it involved ghosts or if everything was just gore.Who the heck was Jimmy and what was he doing? First it seems like he's just an insane child next it seems he's just the victim of his mother's insanity. Then suddenly he's some kind of cruel mastermind and then he's suddenly just a teenage boy in love again.This movie would only be good for those who can overlook detail and like to think. Everyone else will just get confused or think it's lame.".

They put in a million random shots that were left unexplained and then gave some kind of random solution at the end. An example of this is the mother's crazy talk to Jimmy's father. That was answered by the fact that she was talking about Malestrazza. But it still didn't answer whether or not she meant to put him there. I mean it WAS his tomb. He WANTED to be there.Were there any ghosts in there? Was Malestrazza psychic? I certainly don't know. Sam kept hearing voices and Malestrazza was really weird. It became hard to tell whether or not it involved ghosts or if everything was just gore.Who the heck was Jimmy and what was he doing? First it seems like he's just an insane child next it seems he's just the victim of his mother's insanity. Then suddenly he's some kind of cruel mastermind and then he's suddenly just a teenage boy in love again.This movie would only be good for those who can overlook detail and like to think. Everyone else will just get confused or think it's lame.";

The movie is about a building by a strange architect who killed several people by walling them in his architecture. Years after the murders are found out a female demolition expert is coming to get data to take down the building. And here it gets absurd... the building is about to be pulled and she lives in it in a perfect apartment with furniture along with a bunch of other strange inhabitants... they basically get evicted when the explosions team turns up. Now that is for the realism of Walled in. Anyway the strange atmosphere of the building keeps your interest and makes you forget about some clumsy editing and ridiculous dialog along the way. The problem is that Walled in is damn slow and ultimately leads to a finale that is so incredibly dumb you have to see it to believe it. The mix of unexplained supernatural elements an incredibly lame love story is strange in an interesting way at first in a hard to bear way in the middle and in laughable way at the end.The basic idea is so stupid that I wonder who gave the go to work on that script...

Instead I got this crazy serial murder mystery involving the building's deranged architect Joe Malestrazza Pascal Greggorywho's been on the lamb from the police since it was discovered in his monstrosity the Malestrazza Building some 16 tenants who were entombed by him  obviously for being late in paying their rent in its walls.One of Joe's victims also happened to be the building's caretaker the creepy looking Mary's Deborah Kara Unger husband. The spacedout looking Mary together with her even creeper looking 15 year old son Jimmy Cameron Bright have been living in the building since Joe with the police hot on his tail checked out.Sam showing up at the building to get everything ready to blow it sky high finds that not only Mary and Jimmy live in it but also disabled army veteran Burnett played by former Tronto Argonaut offensive lineman Eugene Clark and the somewhat senile Denise Jane Hedlyon as well! Jimmy who's sick and tired of taking orders from his overbearing mom Mary tries to hook up even though she old enough to be his big sister Sam and finally leave the place and start a life of his own.SPOILERS It's then that we and Sam get the surprise of our lives in finding out that the elusive Joe Malestrazza has been living in the building the entire time he was supposed to be on the run from the law! Joe's been kept under lock and keyin the buildings top floor by Mary herself as punishment for not only doing in some 15 or so former tenant but her husbandand Jimmy's fatheras well! The rest the movie centers around poor Sam who ends up being locked up together with the mad as a hatter Joe Malesrazza having to put up with Joe's craziness that almost drives her to the brink of madness! Joe seems to want to be done in for all the hurt he's done over the years like having his godawful Malesrazza Buliding built and wants for reasons he only knows Sam to be the person to do him in! This all would have been good and well if Sam by knocking off two monstrosities with one blast of explosives would have finished off Joe together with his unsightly that looked like a modern version of Hitler's Bunker Malestrazza Building! It's just too bad that the movie due to its lack of imagination and sense of justice didn't end the way we expected and hoped it would! With a great big Bang!".

Burnett physically sick and hostile to attempts to destroy the building expresses Sam's anger at her lack of control over her life. Mary bizarrely committed to the preservation of the tomb of her murdered husband represents Sam's frustrated and creepy desire to please her father.

Malestrazza Jimmy's serialmurdering slave is a manifestation of Sam's deepest fears and superstitions he subscribes to Egyptian mysticism and cuts himself in punishment for his sins. Malestrazza's teeth are as rotten as Sam's mind.The film ends in the total shattering of Sam's sanity symbolized by the neardemolition of the building and she nearly commits suicide resulting in the death of her paranoid delusion Jimmy the god and puppeteer of her universe. However the demolition is stopped and Sam's body is saved but she will never recover from her total destruction. This is the true message of the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "People has been anticipating the release of this film since it was launched and here it is.In short it is a mixture of human emotions. A remake of the 2010 Telugu hit Vedam and directed by Radhakrishna Jagarlamudi who directed the original as well. The film was eagerly anticipated because two reasons which are an ensemble starcast which is a rarity in Tamil cinema and Yuvan's music.Vaanam is STR's first movie after the success of the romantic flick Vinnaithandi Varuvaaya. As Cable Raja he played his role as a slum dweller to perfection. This proves he can really play varied roles. Bharath played the role of a budding rockstar well. His body language and dialogues suits him perfectly while Vega was adequate in her role as Bharath's companion.Anushka reprised her role from the original and she did a good job here as well. Like Anushka Saranya also reprised her role from the original. As a poor weaver she excels in her role. Her body language and dialogue delivery is brilliant.Prakashraj as usual played his role with finesse. This time he played the role of a discriminated Muslim with sheer excellence. Santhanam was good as STR's sidekick. He impresses with his usual comic antics alongside VTV Ganesh as well. Debutant Jasmin Bhasin performed relatively good and fills the requirements of her character. Hats off to her for dubbing in her own voice. An impressive attempt.One of the highlights of the film is Yuvan Shankar Raja's music. YSR has done a wonderful job. The film's BGM suits the mood of the film well but it is kinda loud in certain parts of the film. Evandi Unna Pethan is definitely the one of the best songs along with No Money No Honey. Both songs were wellchoreographed and STR's dance moves are mesmerising.Nirav Shah's cinematography is excellent as usual. The colour tone suits the scenes perfectly although the angles were a bit dizzying in certain scenes. The songs were well picturized.Stunts by Silva is commendable and apt for the action scenes. Anthony's editing is crisp and the film does not drag.Vaanam is a potpourri of emotions and the performance of the cast is excellent plus it does come with a message for all. A different treat for movie buffs and I can easily say that it is one of the best movies to come out of the Tamil cinema industry.".

Each of the character in the movie lives up to the expectation and every character has a message to display which is an important criteria for a movie goer like me. Thus the music was a well done task by Yuvan Shankar Raja not only by giving a chart buster single yet the song Vaanam sung by himself was exceptionally woven brilliantly together with the story line. As the plot shapes together it draws more and more interest to know what will happen next.The acting of star cast such as StrBarathAnushka Saranya Prakash Raj VTV Ganesh and Santhanam was brilliant and subtle and authentic. The climax was brilliant and it will touch your soul and will make you think . The ending of the movie is not an ending it's more to the beginning of a new life.

Just like Crash the characters intertwine at some points with many subplots and themes involving judging others racism religious discrimination power and other horrible things that plagues this world.The movie has a good screenplay good music and light comedy thrown in here and there. A complex story from South India it is and that's saying something as it never happens normally and if it did happens usually they suck. But this one's much better.A movie well worth watching.
