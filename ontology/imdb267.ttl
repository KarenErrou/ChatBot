	schema:headline " Excellence continues in one of the most memorable entries";
	schema:reviewBody "This is quite probably the most mentioned and possibly even watched of the movies concerning The Olsen Gang. The reason is one scene that defines the genius that is the writing and directing that is Bahs and Balling and the OlsenBanden movies The scene at the Danish Royal theater featuring both the Overture of Elverhj and one of this country's two National Anthems. Just about everyone reading this probably already knows exactly what the scene details... and anyone who doesn't should not simply read about it. It's one of the most unforgettable scenes in movie history as far as comedy goes. For my money anyone who considers themself to possess a sense of humor should watch this scene at least once and it doesn't hurt to see it more than that. I've watched this film so much that the VHS tape is worn... and I'm still enjoying the scene immensely and noticing amazing details about it. The plot is wellwritten and interesting. Including nobility was a marvelous idea and they have a lot of fun with the class. The pacing is right on... I was never bored for a second. The adding of Fie Brge's girlfriend is great and Lene Brndum did a lot with an amount of lines that could practically be counted on a hand. Her facial and body language do most of her acting and it works great. Ernst Meyer provides a delightfully Francophile chef. Bent Mejding gives an incredible performance in the small role of the conductor. And Asbjrn Andersen deserves a mention... his last role a cameo and then one so fitting. It could be argued that he portrays himself. The humor is very sophisticated and retains the human touch that makes these films stand head and shoulders above the typical Danish comedy of this periodwhilst admittedly many of them are hilarious. There is a very small amount of cartoony humor in this one but it's such a brief occurrence it makes little difference one way or the other. The police are made fun of again and this time the granting of medals and such are added to the parody pile. There appears to be a common theme between this and the former... that of workers having outlived the time they grew up in and preferred to live in. The good old days are no more so to speak. A bit in this that begs mention is when Poul Bundgaard and Ove Verner Hansen who were both opera singers both emit some rather deep vocal sounds. There's an added touch of irony when Bundgaard being asked what it was he just did replies I don't know! whilst grinning nervously. A thoroughly wellwritten and highly entertaining film in a great series. I recommend this to any fan of the series andor of Danish comedy in general. I'd suggest you make sure to have watched as many of the previous films as you can first for important background and character knowledge. 810".

The movies in this series are probably the best danish comedies ever made they are not annoying as several of the older Danish comedies and the humour is intelligent and peculiar.In my opinion one of the best Olsenbanden movies made. As the other earlier Olsenbanden movies this one has supreme acting from Sproge Grundwald Bundgaard and Walther. On top of this comes what I believe is Arthur Jensens best part ever as the pettythief Kongen with high ambitions and a snobbish attitude. I never liked Poul Reichardt much and I dont find him convincing in this movie either playing the part as Knaegten the partner of  Kongen.What makes this Olsenbanden movie exceptional is the brilliant script. The fact that Egon Olsen Sprogoee has found a worthy advisory in Kongen carries this movie through very well  much better than some of the later movies in the series. So 810 from me for some good entertainment".

	schema:reviewBody "I had watched this film a long time ago as a kid. When I saw it again after seeing most of other Olsenbanden films I found this one a bit disappointing. It seems like the movie makers were searching for a proper formula for the series  which they fortunately found in later films. In this film firstly the gang is involved in a common burglary against honest citizens. The only excuse for an opening scene is that this is a very funny situation joke. The title big score is stealing 4 millions of collected taxes. ...Not that a government guarantees to make a proper use of money collected from people but it feels better when our heroes punish some dishonest individuals who deserved it. The police in the film are just annoyingly goofy but this is also the last film of the series to make such simple jokes of the police.The ending is dissatisfying and just wrong  if the Olsen's gang could not keep the stolen money then why on Earth the script makers awarded an evil woman from the other gang with the loot?... Was it only because she was attractive although her character did not do anything in the whole film to be likable? Moreover the lone woman in an expensive fur showing a suitcase full of money would probably soon fell a victim of some scoundrel and we even see a candidate clearly interested in her money. By the way Annika Persson hardly said a word in the film and as far as it is known this is her only role. There was even a nudity scene when we saw her from a back coming to bath  if I recall correctly the only nudity scene in a whole series. Although pleasant to look at her character did not fit to the series. All in all I feel it would have been more appropriate ending if contents of the suitcase just had spilled on the airport ground.Despite this criticism the film is worthy to look at. There are some funny twists when Yvonne criticizes Kjeld and Benny praising Egon or when Benny takes over planning in Olsen's style and Kjeld acts like Benny. Even a musical scene with Kongen and Kngten is an intelligent and funny spoof of old Hollywood movies and does not seem out of place.".

	schema:headline " terrifying vision";
	schema:reviewBody "The viewer is warned by the director at the onset but it is nonetheless a terrifying portrayal that kept my heart in my throat until the very end. The fable is set in the Middle Ages and the armored knight on horseback in the opening scene leads one to expect an exalted image of heroism but this expectation is exploded in gradually mounting fashion almost like the medieval battering rams beating down the castle door.First the child murders to fulfill his father's charge then he grows up without love as he has deprived his mother of love setting in motion an ever more insidious chain reaction of smoldering hate. The child now grown up as the knight of the castle goes away to the wars after having given the world a son Arnaud and daughter Beatrice who is purity personified. She reminded me of the daughter in Virgin Spring.Awaiting her father we see her communion with nature and the primitive Virgin and Child icon that sits in judgement throughout the film. Beatrice expresses loving innocence and expects it in return but when her father returns each act reveals with a shock his real or changed nature seated at table he finishes eating washes his hands and after he has cruelly described his son as a coward he sees his son still eating and further humiliates him in a pattern that culminates in an act that will cause terror even in those inured to the depiction of violence and depravity in today's movies. The rape of Beatrice by her father is in itself but one further step taking his blameless offspring into his descent into hell while the last incident with his son forced to dress as a girl to be raped as prey is the most horrific of all and certainly ranks with the reallife event in Boys don't cry.Throughout the film Tavernier seems to be showing us a window into two worlds that of the real Crusades and that of the contemporary era where acts of violence are almost the only way some beings can communicate.  We are meant to feel the same terror that Beatrice in a remarkable performance by Julie Delpy endures and that of her brother played by the director's son Nils. As for Donnadieu as the father he inhabits the role with a coldness and brutality glimpsed in his eyes in an early closeup at table that immedately tells Beatrice and us that something is amiss.Moviemakers today seem not to be able to get by without sex and violence and the intention is often to shock and titillate for its own sake. But through Tavernier's lens we experience the genuine emotion of the actions almost unaware of the acting per se. The ultimate compliment to the cast and director. Some previous reviewers have asked what is the point of the film except to depict a horrific case of childfamily abuse? As a fable I believe the director is saying there has been no progress in human nature.One final point this movie also encapsulates Tavernier's attitude toward the horrors of war Capitaine Conan La Vie et Rien d'autre etc in another guise  war dehumanizes the living. If we compare this film with his Un Dimanche a la Campagne we will understand the meaning of cruelty in the balance of his values and his aesthetic of spirituality in daily life as expressed in the faces of children or Beatrice or Sabine Azema's. Five stars  but not for the weakhearted.".

	onyx:emotionText "The viewer is warned by the director at the onset but it is nonetheless a terrifying portrayal that kept my heart in my throat until the very end. The fable is set in the Middle Ages and the armored knight on horseback in the opening scene leads one to expect an exalted image of heroism but this expectation is exploded in gradually mounting fashion almost like the medieval battering rams beating down the castle door.First the child murders to fulfill his father's charge then he grows up without love as he has deprived his mother of love setting in motion an ever more insidious chain reaction of smoldering hate. The child now grown up as the knight of the castle goes away to the wars after having given the world a son Arnaud and daughter Beatrice who is purity personified. She reminded me of the daughter in Virgin Spring.Awaiting her father we see her communion with nature and the primitive Virgin and Child icon that sits in judgement throughout the film. Beatrice expresses loving innocence and expects it in return but when her father returns each act reveals with a shock his real or changed nature seated at table he finishes eating washes his hands and after he has cruelly described his son as a coward he sees his son still eating and further humiliates him in a pattern that culminates in an act that will cause terror even in those inured to the depiction of violence and depravity in today's movies.

The script written by the director's exwife presents a chilling portrait of a nobleman whose fury against women is only one expression of his rage against God. Thirty years after murdering his mother's lover he brutally torments his own son and corrupts his adoring daughter by first raping her and then proclaiming his intention to take her as his wife. Tavernier captures the often oppressive atmosphere of the setting with plenty of nervous energy carried along by a restless handheld camera and the director's astonishing eye for presumably authentic period detail. All the primitive manners and arcane medieval symbolism make the film perhaps easier to respect than enjoy it's a dark and violent film about a dark and violent age when women like cattle were not thought to have immortal souls.".

	schema:reviewBody "Julie Delpy stars in this horrific film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in France of the 14th Century. The film attempts to shatter the romantic chivalry image of the heroic medieval knight by showing a rather dreary image of the period defined by psychological dysfunction and violence. The movie opens with a child Franois growing up in the shadow of the Hundred Years' War told by his father to keep his mother safe and to wait for his return. Franois takes action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed. Franois murders him in the name of defending his father's honour. Like father like son Franois grows up and leaves his family also to go to the same war. This setting is somewhat of an explanation for the events to come as on his way home we already notice that something is wrong with Franois. The war has not done well with him he has changed.The daughter Batrice de Cortemart Delpy awaits her beloved father to return from captivity of the English. She is pure of heart and she was left to take care of the estate while her father was gone. In her father's absence Batrice needs to deal with financial difficulties which strengthens Batrice's hope that her father will return to save her. But upon his return she notices that he lost the will to enjoy life and he tortures and humiliates everything around him even his own daughter. From this points the film depicts various ways how Franois torments his family. Starting with humiliating his own son and ending with the rape of his own daughter Batrice.Setting the film in the Middle Ages supposed to soften the blow as the viewer may tell himself that these kind of violent acts were held in difficult times. And indeed many films on the topic of Incest such as Tim Roth's The War Zone 1999 which are contemporary were more shocking because of that.Delpy appears in this film in several daring nude scenes. Indeed she appears to be angelic and beautiful.I was annoyed when I saw some animal torture scenes. I believe and this is not confirmed that some birds were killed for the making of this film which really upsets me. The quality of a film drops when real violence is used towards animals. I would hope that this movie will be rereleased without those cruelty scenes. Those scenes do not contribute much to the film storyline.Overall the movie is too long. The script is problematic. We don't get to see Franois and Batrice before the war we don't really get the answer why is he changed to such extreme. I would have pass on this film however I have to mention a few scenes that made this film worth watching Scenes of a young child being able to murder in cold blood is truly shocking. I saw it first time on City of God 2002. Here Franois murders his mother's lover while his father away at war. Excellent scene and very graphic.  The scenes from Batrice being raped by her father till she finds out she is pregnant from him are truly shocking and interesting. The scene after the rape where Delpy burns her cloths and cleans herself. She asks her brother to kick her in the stomach with hopes to have a miscarriage. The brother humiliation scenes where the father dumps his son's head into the food  humiliating him then ranting about the war. Later dressing his son with women's cloths.The film won the Csar French Oscar for Best Costume Design I agree the costumes here really make the film look authentic for the time period. The movie location is Chteau de Puivert a real 12th century castle and a historical monument located in Aude SouthCentral France. Beautiful castle and mountain view really helps you set into the period of this film. The film also nominated for 3 more Csar awards but they were all snatched to the widely successful French film Au revoir les enfants Goodbye Children 1998. Released as Beatrice in New York City March 1987. Only to be screened in France on November 2007. Watched it on YES3 on 3 May 2007 1745 at work.".

That was until I saw Pledge This. ever since then I have been unable to say worst movie ever because I know that it wasn't as bad as this one. Ill admit I thought I knew what I was getting into when I saw this movie. I knew that it was National Lampoon and how that name no longer means what it did in the 70s and 80s. I knew that it was staring Paris Hilton so that I shouldn't really expect anything majestic. But I thought that it would be a more or less fun 90 minutes if i wanted to watch a simple brainless sex comedy with lots of fart jokes. Boy was I wrong. There is nothing good about this movie. Not the story obviously or the acting. But I was almost stunned to see how bad the rest of the movie was. It was poorly edited the quality was awful. One whole scene took place in a white room and the walls were so bright that I couldn't even see the characters. unfortunatly I was still able to hear what was being said. Now I'm not the type of person to normally go around bashing movies without reason. But I almost feel that I cant review this movie other than to repeat that it was bad bad bad.

That was until I saw Pledge This. ever since then I have been unable to say worst movie ever because I know that it wasn't as bad as this one. Ill admit I thought I knew what I was getting into when I saw this movie. I knew that it was National Lampoon and how that name no longer means what it did in the 70s and 80s. I knew that it was staring Paris Hilton so that I shouldn't really expect anything majestic. But I thought that it would be a more or less fun 90 minutes if i wanted to watch a simple brainless sex comedy with lots of fart jokes. Boy was I wrong. There is nothing good about this movie. Not the story obviously or the acting. But I was almost stunned to see how bad the rest of the movie was. It was poorly edited the quality was awful. One whole scene took place in a white room and the walls were so bright that I couldn't even see the characters. unfortunatly I was still able to hear what was being said. Now I'm not the type of person to normally go around bashing movies without reason. But I almost feel that I cant review this movie other than to repeat that it was bad bad bad.

There is barely any continuity between scenes and major plot points are often introduced but then mysteriously forgotten forever by the next scene. Gags and jokes are lame every part of the movie seems to be designed specifically to insult your intelligence as a viewer. Worse the entire movie is based around the idea of the sorority being hot but there wasn't a single part about it that I found hot.

Noone who isn't past puberty can find this funny I watched this with 3 of my friends. We all like high school movies we all go to college especially when we are hung over from last night which we were when we watched this movie.First we wanted to shut it off and go watch paint dry but then some randomly placed very nice TA came in to the picture and we decided to continue watching. We didn't understand anything about the plot and if you do you have probably written the manuscript. There is no logic at all in this movie.This is what I believe that the movie is about Paris Hilton is the head of some girl sorority her biggest dream is to be on the cover of FHM softplayboy and now she has her chance. FHM have a competition where the most beautiful sorority gets to be on the cover awesome! But oh no the sorority has to have a nerd girl too so now they have to let in a group of nerdgirls in the sorority.Actually the only thing that kept us watching was that every time one of us started to complain about how bad this movie was one of the girls in movie showed her titties. Kudos to the director who actually saw when the movie sucked so bad that titties was the only thing that could save the movie. There are a LOT of randomly placed tittiescenes which have nothing to do with the plot in this movie. And they're needed.This movie has no logic actually not even scenes that fit together it is for no one that isn't IN puberty the few laughs you'll get is when the movie makes so little sense that it's actually funny. The girls in this movie are very nice tough but they don't manage to make it watchable.Unless if you reallyreally like tits then maybe this movie can make you not vomit. If you do like tits I know I do rent American Pie 5 instead it's funnier. Or rent porn it has better acting.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some films get a score of 1 because they are ineptly filmed or the acting is terrible due to incredibly low budgets. Given what they had they couldn't do much better.. This film technically speaking isn't that badit looks professional. But it is also the ugliest and most shallow film I have ever seen without a single thing to recommend it.The film stars Paris Hilton and she also narrates much of the film. The premise is that she's the ultimate hottie and she goes to South Beach to help a sorority become hot enough to win some pointless award. And much of the narration consists of her finding fault with everyone and it abounds with her putdowns as no one could possibly be as hot and sexy as her. She forgot to also add as narcissistic and pathetic.Here are a few of the highlights in this uplifting and sublime film a bathroom where the toilets and sinks become geysers of liquefied human waste and it spews on everyone an Indian lady who learns about the joys of a vibrator a lady showing off her horribly scarred breasts following breast surgery stereotypes as opposed to realistic characters such as the obligatory fat girl with a suitcase stuffed with snacks and the religious zealot some antilesbian and antiwoman remarksjokes I'm not supersensitive about politically correct stuff and still it clearly offended me to hear women referred to that way bestiality as well as the crudest language I've ever heard not funny crude just classless and crass. Clearly the film shows all the imagination and grace of a movie written by a 13 yearolda very nasty and talentless 13 yearold. Currently this and several other Paris Hilton films are in the hallowed Bottom 100 on IMDb. Considering it consists of Hilton dispensing advice to others on how to be a better person or just her torturing people for fun I could certainly understand it making the list! It's nasty and cruelwithout a hint of grace or cleverness. If you think that Paris does not get enough time in front of the camera and you have absolutely no values other than to look 'hot' then this movie is for you. Otherwise find something else to do...ANYTHING else!".

The acting is horrid the plot makes absolutely no sense and the execution is dead on arrival. All this and more spells doom in a project that should have been left on the cutting room floor.It doesn't help that I find Paris Hilton to be extremely annoying and totally unworthy of the screen time she has been given but to make matters worse she narrates a movie in which she constantly tries to reaffirm her character as better than everyone else but what was vividly clear at least in my eyes is that she is talking about herself as a person not the character she so poorly portrays.You would figure that someone like Paris would be able to handle playing the spoiled rich girl since the role hits so close to home but unfortunately even she seems like she doesn't know what is going on. She appears disoriented and dumbfounded as to what exactly she is doing as do those surrounding her.This film doesn't have a saving grace. It has nothing to redeem it except for the fact it ends. And the ending is as predictable as anything you will ever find. In a movie where a snobby rich girl gets all the admiration and respect one easily expects the ending to knock her down a peg.... and that is exactly what happens. No curveballs here. The screenplay is bland and extremely unoriginal.Every single aspect from beginning to end was both predictable and poorly executed. It is bad enough to make a movie in which nothing new is attempted but to do what has already been done and do it in a lackluster manner? That is inexcusable.If I am to pledge thee one sage drop of advice Avoid this and you'll be forever better for it.".

Anyway I have seen quite a few Paris Hilton films and enjoyed them all and to be honest I didn't think she did a bad job here guys. I've seen her do worse like her performance in Bottom's Up with Jason Mewes. It almost appeared as if she didn't really want to do that movie as she was not making an effort to making her character believable. As for the rest of Pledge This? The movie was filled with extremely lame punchlines and a predictable outcome. I watched the Special Features and one of the actors I believe it was actually called it a great script! You could have put I don't know Ryan Reynolds and Tara Reid in this movie and it still wouldn't have been a great script! I will give it 3 stars because even though it was predictable I thought with funnier punchlines it actually could have been a hilarious movie. All in all I think Paris has the potential to be a good actress if she'd stop accepting roles that are based on well....her! Oh and WHAT HAPPENED TO NATIONAL LAMPOON'S????".

As it is the film plays on the safe side but does attempt to draw on the underlying motivations for people's curious needs.The film's conclusion is that the dominatrixes that staff Pandora's Box a high class brothel on Manhattan's 18th St just off 5th Ave provide a much needed therapeutic environment. Mistress Raven's pleasuredome is just a good place to let off steam and maybe understand the forces often found in childhood that led to your particular quirk. And no it doesn't always have to involve pain.There is an attempt to categorise people's various addictions Whether to fabric of one sort or another corporal punishment constriction sociopolitical roleplay Jews who like to recreate Nazi fantasies blacks regressing to the plantation eg. and so on. Like other attempts in this direction such as Katherine Gates book Deviant Desires the filmaker is not exhaustive in his presentation of the full breadth of fetishism. But hey! We do only have an hour and a half.This film exclusively centers around dominantsubmissive themes. It errs on the side of good taste by only addressing the more palatable female dominating men or occasionally other women scenarios.In short Pandora's Box turns out to be not such a bad thing to open after all just as long as you've got plenty of money.".

As it is the film plays on the safe side but does attempt to draw on the underlying motivations for people's curious needs.The film's conclusion is that the dominatrixes that staff Pandora's Box a high class brothel on Manhattan's 18th St just off 5th Ave provide a much needed therapeutic environment. Mistress Raven's pleasuredome is just a good place to let off steam and maybe understand the forces often found in childhood that led to your particular quirk. And no it doesn't always have to involve pain.There is an attempt to categorise people's various addictions Whether to fabric of one sort or another corporal punishment constriction sociopolitical roleplay Jews who like to recreate Nazi fantasies blacks regressing to the plantation eg. and so on. Like other attempts in this direction such as Katherine Gates book Deviant Desires the filmaker is not exhaustive in his presentation of the full breadth of fetishism. But hey! We do only have an hour and a half.This film exclusively centers around dominantsubmissive themes. It errs on the side of good taste by only addressing the more palatable female dominating men or occasionally other women scenarios.In short Pandora's Box turns out to be not such a bad thing to open after all just as long as you've got plenty of money.";

	schema:reviewBody "I can't really say that the idea of fetishes appeals to me too much  my 'knowledge' of SM before seeing this film has mostly come from the 'trash' cinema that I enjoy watching. I've got to say that this film didn't particularly teach me anything about the scene and the people that enjoy being dominated by 'superior' women that I didn't already know but established documentary maker Nick Broomfield's look behind usually closed doors makes for enjoyable viewing even if it isn't particularly insightful or informative. The film focuses on New York fetish club 'Pandora's Box' and we watch as Broomfield films various sessions with the mistresses and their clients. These range from rather tame whippings to more obscure sessions involving concentration camp domination and 'infantilism'. Nick Broomfield's approach is very objective and he films everything without ever making a stance on what he's seeing. Even his voice is very cold and lifeless and it doesn't always make for compelling viewing. Ironically the most interesting thing about this movie is not the filming involving SM acts but rather the insight into the dominatrix's lives and their thoughts on their jobs. One of the mistresses a woman who calls herself 'Mistress Raven' brings up a good point during the film about the director making a documentary about a subject he himself has never experienced and that pretty much sums it all up. This film is interesting for the most part but Broomfield's closed mind unwillingness to partake in the acts that he's filming ensure that this is more of an expose than an analysis. Still it's something of an eye opener although people that are interested in this topic won't find out anything new and those that aren't interested in it are likely to find out that SM is in fact not all that fascinating.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fetishes is an hour  twenty five minute documentary set in an SM dungeon establishment called Pandora's Box located in Manhattan New York focusing on it's Mistresses  clients who pay upwards of a 1000 for a session... I watched Fetishes on the British special edition DVD which has an intro by coeditor writer coproducer  director Nick Broomfield which informs us that he spent two months not two weeks as the IMDb plot summary would have you believe filming there  that he didn't know much about SM before he started. Once Fetishes starts proper we are treated to various clips form a Betty Page film called Teaserama 1955  Nick doing an introductory narration that moreorless repeats exactly what he said in the now not so special intro on the DVD great extra guys. After the obligatory establishing shot of a busy Manhattan street complete with yellow taxis we go inside Pandora's Box where Mistress Raven the manager greets us  Nick. Fetishes then jumps from interviewee to interviewee as Nick  his crew film  ask questions to the various Mistresses  their clients. But you don't really want to know about that do you? I'm pretty sure most people who are contemplating watching Fetishes are doing so to get a look at some kinky fetishistic sessions. I personally found the session footage not to be particularly strong or shocking  rather weak considering what you can find on the internet. There are scenes of whippings a brief nipple piercing rubber  breath play infaltalism cross dressing nipple clamps wrestling verbal humiliation a couple of phone sessions  various people crawling around on all fours as I found this footage rather bland  shown in glimpses as the hand held camera jerks around all over the place. In between this session footage there are interviews with both the Mistresses  clients but they are short  apart from one or two exceptions not that informative I found Nick asking various Dominatrix's the same what made you want to be a Mistress? question became tedious  the answers were almost meaningless. In fact I only watched it last night  I'm struggling to remember anything about it or what was said other than the session footage. Nick's comments about most of Pandora's Box clients being rich high powered lawyers businessmen  doctors really isn't that enlightening is it? Most of what he says isn't but that was a good example of the sort of commentary Broomfield provides. There is one part that I remember well during a phone session the Mistresses were smiling trying hard not to burst out laughing  ending up looking very bored which didn't do them any favours at all. Broomfield like's to use classical music throughout probably for some misguided artistic reason or other. Fetishes is OK if you want a voyeuristic look at SM at it's most basic level but if your looking for something with intention meaning  something which ends up being thought provoking then Fetishes isn't for you in my opinion. As I have already mentioned I viewed the British special edition DVD which contained an extra 40 something minutes of additional scenes as an extra these scenes consist almost entirely of session footage  it's a shame it was dropped as I personally thought it was better than what ended up on screen. There is a long interview with the French Mistress Beatrice as she performs a session whipping a naked man who is kneeling on the floor  then making him lick her high heeled shoes eventually she describes him as a shoe licking dog as Nick continues to interrogate her this sequence should have been left in even if her accent sometimes makes it difficult to understand what she was saying. There is an embarrassing moment when a naked slave walks in on another first time client  everyone has a laugh about it not sure why. Mistress Delilah gets some extra scenes as she talks about having to leave the profession  piercing someone's body with needles  is more graphic then the nipple piercing in the finished film. As well as various other little bits  pieces there is quite a long scene of a 'slave auction' where Mistresses bid on slaves  get to keep them for a night I suppose once again I thought this sequence was better than most of which that ended up in the finished product  all of these scenes play as they were filmed without any sort of inane commentary by Broomfield which could be a major reason why I preferred this footage. Definitely worth a watch  I enjoyed it overall but just don't expect to be any the wiser about SM apart from a few tame session ideas.".

But in spite of itself this film did have its informative moments.About 4 or 5 dominatrices from the same 'house' in Manhattan are featured. They are supposedly the best and most expensive in their field. I found them awkward and completely unintimidating. Scenes of them 'at work' looked like embarrassingly bad dinner theater or a high school play where the kids didn't learn their lines properly and are doing some very cringeworthy ad libbing. None of them had a very commanding presence. They all looked like weak underfed women to me. But the 'clients' seemed completely engaged and taken in with the scenarios or fantasies. I was amazed.The real reason I was interested in this film was to know why anyone would pay for these services. And to Mr. Bloomfield's credit he does have a good amount of client interviews that shed some light on that subject. I found the clients were far more varied and interesting than the rather predictable and clichd 'mistresses'.Mr. Broomfield maintained his distance at all times even when he was offered a free 'session' to further his knowledge of the experience. I think he should have taken it and evolved from a vaguely judgmental voyeur to possibly a better film maker.All in all if you're into documentaries there are loads of them much better than this. If you're curious about the world of fetishes doms  subs etc. give it a try but keep your expectations low. If you just want to see naked people getting spanked there is a bit of that but strange as it may seem this isn't a terribly sexy documentary.

These are real people with all their quirks and stupidities and rich relationships with one another. There is an accurate full portrayal of the human condition and an acceptance of what that means that is rare to nonexistent in movies today.If you like films that put you into another world for a couple of hours you've got to see this. The late 19th century Northern Italy textile factory is amazingly realized. The black  white cinematography is gorgeous and the acting is convincing all around.Mastroianni is a personal favorite and this is a terrific role for him very unlike his usual suave modern urban characters.This film is a masterpiece.

Mastroianni is particularly wonderful here in a very nuanced performance where he goes from nebbish professor to inspirational and powerful leader in matters of seconds. The script is very strong and Rotunno's cinematography is excellent. Monicelli injects the film with so many details that hit their mark that he has gone from a very good director to a great one in my estimation. The early scenes at the factory are truly remarkable in a uniquely cinematic way. They hardly contain any dialogue and put you in the workers place in a remarkably efficient way.Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most comments on this movie are positive  and quite rightly so. Except for someone who said I Compagni was depressing. Well of course it's depressing  it's an Italian comedy ! Why do you think Monicelli and writers AgeScarpelli abolished the happy end from popular comedy with their milestone farce I Soliti ignoti? Because humor has nothing to do with good feelings. At least it didn't to the eyes of that crazy movie industry which for a while gave its country of origin the dimensions of a continent.Which brings me to this other topic  is it possible that most comments here were made by people who saw that movie with English subtitles? That can be a problem especially for comedy. To difference of all other countries of the western world English speaking markets United States England English Canada never developed a dubbing industry worth of the name. Which also means that when they nevertheless try to dub something or other the result is generally awful. Of course from the point of view of domestic market dominance that's excellent  with such a prophylactic wall no foreign movie can seriously compete with Englishspeaking productions. American comedy director Mel Brooks lead the battle a few years ago to have the French farce Les visiteurs dubbed in English and lost.Sometimes I agree that subtitles are the least worse solution. But not when it comes to comedy to farce to entertainment. A subtitled comedy IS NOT FUNNY or much less funny than the originallanguage OR dubbed version. For comedy is a matter of tempo of timing  the oneliners have to fall in place all at the right millisecond. Even more so when it's written by AgeScarpelli the best comedy writers in movie history! And if you're busy reading the words down below instead of watching the faces of the actors most of the time you miss the shot.To me the most striking aspect of I compagni which I saw and resaw in French as Les Camarades is that it is surprisingly funny  not unlike Monicelli's and AgeScarpelli's preceding masterpiece La Grande guerra I Compagni is a commedia all'italiana i.e. a tragicomic satirical fresco where epic and derision are mixed in equal proportions. This is what makes I compagni the best strikemovie ever made  better than Eisenstein's The Strike?!? yes sir! better than John Ford's The Grapes of Wrath?!? yes madam! better than Miguel Littin's Actas de Marusia starring our beloved red icon Gian Maria Volont?!? yes comrade! For its humorist's view of life is the perfect antidote against the rhetoric that almost always permeates that kind of film.Mario Monicelli AgeScarpelli are ENTERTAINERS. Comedy specialists. For sure the type of entertainment they were cooking back then was at the antipodes of Hollywood's feelgood reassuring consolative recipes but IT WAS a recipe all the same attracting spectators in Italian movie theaters by millions and millions. Commedia all'italiana is a SERIAL an industrial recipe producing tons and tons of movies each year between 1958 and 1980.My problem here you see is one of perception  as soon as a movie is not American it is almost automatically perceived in the United States as something for intellectuals happy few snob radicalchic whatever. The idea that foreigners also make ENTERTAINMENT for the million is quasi taboo. Well it is a grave mistake.As a spectator I've never been so entertained than by Mario Monicelli's great comedies of the 50s 60s and 70s  even when they are also very tragic i.e. depressing as this one evidently is.".

Commedia all'italiana is a SERIAL an industrial recipe producing tons and tons of movies each year between 1958 and 1980.My problem here you see is one of perception  as soon as a movie is not American it is almost automatically perceived in the United States as something for intellectuals happy few snob radicalchic whatever. The idea that foreigners also make ENTERTAINMENT for the million is quasi taboo. Well it is a grave mistake.As a spectator I've never been so entertained than by Mario Monicelli's great comedies of the 50s 60s and 70s  even when they are also very tragic i.e. depressing as this one evidently is.";

	schema:headline " Monicelli delivers an effective blend of neorealism and commedia all'italiana";
	schema:reviewBody "Mario Monicelli was one of the successors to the neorealist movement in Italian cinema which began in the mid'40s and catapulted Italy to the forefront of international cinema. Following it came a generation of Italian filmmakers  including Fellini and Antonioni  who had apprenticed under the neorealist directors and who kept Italian cinema alive for one more generation while the big three neorealists Rossellini De Sica and Visconti moved in increasingly disparate directions. Monicelli was one such filmmaker to emerge from the waning neorealist movement. His first big success I believe was the 1958 film Big Deal on Madonna Street which is the first major film I know of from the commedia all'italiana genre comedy Italian style taking its name from Pietro Germi's 1961 film Divorce Italian Style. It's a wonderful comedy and I'd recommend seeing it if possible before The Organizer.Commedia all'italiana is generally characterized by a mixture of mildly overthetop humor and a gentle poignancy that anchors what could otherwise be absurdist farce. There tend to be light political undertones which unobtrusively satirize contemporary life in Italy and an emotional undercurrent that stems from a sympathy with likable characters who simply can't get a foothold in modern society.This all fits Big Deal on Madonna Street to a tee but what about The Organizer? The film released in 1963 and starring Marcello Mastroianni has all the aforementioned qualities but in smaller doses. It goes heavier on the drama and lighter on the comedy which is nearly always saturated with a pathos that exceeds what is typical of the commedia all'italiana genre. The resulting blend is sometimes uneven. There were times when I wasn't sure if something was supposed to be sad or funny. But I suppose there's no need for the two to be mutually exclusive and there were other times where the humor and drama came together wonderfully. The Organizer is halfway between a standard commedia all'italiana film and a more traditional neorealist exercise like Bicycle Thieves or Umberto D.. We can certainly see the neorealist influence all over the film but we can also see Monicelli's own unique brand of comedic farce in this entertaining blend of cinematic styles. Monicelli was a lifelong Marxist and communist. Other than the apolitical Fellini and perhaps Rossellini whose politics are still a bit of an enigma to me Italian cinema was filled with Marxist thinkers and selfproclaimed communists Visconti Pasolini De Sica Antonioni Rosi Bertolucci Pontecorvo and Monicelli. In fact cinema in general has been filled with them Godard Gorin Marker Varda Fassbinder shima Eisenstein Kalatozov et cetera. More narrowminded American viewers will need to be reminded that communism did not have the terrible connotation in Europe in the '60s that it has in America today. McCarthy did his job well in demonizing communism for Americans but being a communist in Europe in those days was simply about politically engaged individuals seeking to rectify the social injustice they saw all around them. Today we associate it with tyranny and Stalinism but that is very far from the reality of communism for Europeans who embraced it during the era in which The Organizer was made. Communism was simply a natural and inevitable response for countries like France and Italy who had recently seen the other end of the political spectrum up close and personal. Americans have always been the quickest to scoff at communism partly because we live in the capitalist center of the world but also because here on the other side of the Atlantic we've been largely spared the ugliness of fascism although McCarthy certainly gave us a glimpse.The reason I delve into such contentious territory  something I would normally prefer to avoid  is because The Organizer is a plainly Marxist film brazen in its declaration of political rights and wrongs as those who discuss politics will almost invariably be. If your political compass is locked in a fixed anticommunist position you will likely be unable to enjoy this film which would be a shame because there's a lot to enjoy here if you can set politics aside. I'm not political by nature so I've never had any issue doing that. I respect the prerogative of filmmakers to express their ideas even ones I don't agree with in fact those are often the perspectives I find I learn the most from and so political cinema  of any variety  is always welcome on my television. Overall however The Organizer is actually relatively unbiased compared to many other exercises in leftwing cinema. Monicelli calls it a Marxist film and it most certainly is but it's Marxist in the humanist sense as much as it is in the communist sense. There is of course a deep sympathy with the working class and that on the whole is the dominant tone of the film sympathy. It's not so much the angry revolutionary mode of filmmaking that we see from say Godard in the early '70s. It's based much more in an empathy for human suffering and a desire to see despairing individuals liberated from the prison walls created by their social class. This desire after all was the core of communism before it was bastardized by Stalin.The Organizer is an insightful film about the complexities and moral dilemmas surrounding revolution and while I prefer less biased reflections on the subject such as Fellini's Orchestra Rehearsal Herzog's Even Dwarfs Started Small or Tarr's Werckmeister Harmonies Monicelli does a respectable job of observing the obstacles that stand in the way of the revolutionary process. He is committed to a specific ideology without question but this is not by any means mindless propaganda. This is a high quality film that works both as a dramatic contemplation on the nature of revolution and as a comedy based in lighthearted entertainment. Enjoy it on whichever level you prefer.RATING 8.00 out of 10 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "Mario Monicelli's The Organizer 1963 is an excellent dramatic production.It is a very engaging and compelling period piece set in the late 19th Century textile worker's strike in Turin Italy. The storyline is very believable if not totally historically accurate.The acting by the whole cast was somewhat inspired very sincere and believable. Marcello Mastroianni gives an exceptionally strong performance in a role that is quite different than the several others I seen him portray that of a somewhat mild mannered reflective teacher cum labor organizer who doesn't seem to be quite sure of himself on some level. This is certainly a departure from the glib debonair self assured upper crust character that I've become accustomed to in the other films that I've seen him in. Yetfor me his role in this film confirmed for me the breadth of his acting ability and furthers my belief that he is one of the great actors of all time. Mastroianni is the dramatic lynchpin in this film and carries the storyline to its conclusion.The cinematography in this film is really great giving the viewer a variety of interesting looks as a result of diverse camera positions and camera angles.The period sets and period costumes are very good. The huge indoor factory setting is amazing and made me wonder where they got all that antique machinery.The dramatic tone of the film was just right in my opinion somewhat walking the tightrope between the various emotional tensions inherent in the storyline at various points.This film is just an example of good cinematic storytelling allowing the viewer to see the emerging storyline from a diversity of character perspectives. The storyline has a few interesting twists and the rather downbeat ending was rather unexpected but left me pleasantly speculating about where the story went from there.".

	schema:headline " Another excellent adventure for Sherlock Holmes!";
	schema:reviewBody "This entry in Universal's awesome and prolific series of Sherlock Holmes films is one of the best that I've seen. The series works because it offers a solid hour or so of light entertainment which it peppers with good humour and an engaging plot and that is something that is masterfully handled with this movie. The plot of this film is great and it follows Sherlock Holmes as he makes a rare blunder which leads to a rare and valuable pearl being stolen from a museum. It is then left up to the main man to make up for his mistake as he attempts to search for the lost gem and get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding it's disappearance. This plot makes a great base for a tale about the great detective as it puts him in a position that we don't usually see him in  the man in the wrong. Aside from being amusing this also gives us the chance to see a different side of Basil Rathbone's portrayal of the great detective. His mannerisms and facial expressions as he realises the trouble that his showboating has brought are priceless and a highlight of the series on the whole.Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce make for a great onscreen duo as Sherlock Holmes and his sidekick Dr Watson and they are joined by the inept police sergeant Lestrade and that only increases the comedy element of the movie. The plot line this time doesn't break any new boundaries where mystery plotting is concerned but it ensures that the film always runs smoothly through it's short running time. It also makes for some great dialogue and Holmes' speech towards the end is of particular note for being really well done. The atmosphere for this movie is really well done and as we follow someone that breaks people's backs during the night this helps the story immensely. My only criticism of this film really is the same one that could be applied to most of the series and that's that the film is far too short and we can never really get our teeth into the mystery because the film just isn't on for long enough. However aside from that this is still a very good Sherlock Holmes adventure and if you've enjoyed other entries in the series no doubt you'll like this one too.".

	onyx:emotionText "This entry in Universal's awesome and prolific series of Sherlock Holmes films is one of the best that I've seen. The series works because it offers a solid hour or so of light entertainment which it peppers with good humour and an engaging plot and that is something that is masterfully handled with this movie. The plot of this film is great and it follows Sherlock Holmes as he makes a rare blunder which leads to a rare and valuable pearl being stolen from a museum. It is then left up to the main man to make up for his mistake as he attempts to search for the lost gem and get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding it's disappearance.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1903 Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a short story called The Adventure of the Six Napoleons. In it Inspector Lestrade tells Holmes and Watson of a strange series of seemingly unrelated crimes in which houses are burglarized and bricabrac smashed. Is it the work of a madman or an intelligent criminal? Holmes discovers the running link in the crimes  in each case a cheap bust of Emperor Napoleon I was smashed. Then the crimes become deadlier  a man is murdered at the site of one of the smashups the home of a newspaperman named Harker  a name retained in the movie by a minor victim. Holmes soon finds out that the busts came from a store where a man who fits the description of the criminal worked. This criminal is captured. The final one of the six busts is found and broken before Watson and Lestrade by Holmes. And out pops the world's rarest black pearl the Borgia Pearl. Of course the story is more fully fleshed out by Conan Doyle. His villain is an ethnic type  so there is a little racism though nothing like the racism met with in G.K.Chesterton or R.Austin Freeman. However the story is not totally like that in the film. The villain Beppo is not a criminal mastermind  not a Moriarty type. He has a clever idea not one of many clever ideas. And he kills his victim when he is confronted by an enemy something totally unplanned. There is no creature of the night figure of dread but just Beppo.So the film version is except for the pearl and the busts of Napoleon a rewrite. Giles Connover and the Creeper or as Lestrade calls him the Oxton 'Orror are movie innovations and both are quite effective thanks to Miles Manders acting and unfortunately Rondo Hatton's appearance. But they helped make the film better than average.So does Rathbone. He does a disguise act at the start as good as his song and dance act in THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES. He also has a go at imitating the voice of another actor in the film and he does it nicelyand a disguise at the end. Nice balance there. Bruce adds some good comedy especially when he thinks fast and shows he too can hide the pearl. Also note his scene where he tries to reassure a visitor that he is as good at deductions as Holmes was. Altogether a different story from the Doyle original but it is a good film on it's own merits.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Universal Holmes series was on a roll at this point having just released what is probably the best film in the series The Scarlet Claw earlier the same year. This one is a bit of a step down but on a par with earlier films like Sherlock Holmes Faces Death and The Spider Woman...and on a much higher level than the first three flagwaving WWII propaganda films.This entry is based on the Arthur Conan Doyle story The Six Napoleons. And while numerous changes were made it actually follows the original story more closely than any of the other Universal pictures did. Most of the films were either very loose adaptations amalgams of several different Holmes stories or original scripts that were merely inspired by the Conan Doyle canon. This one however follows the general outline of the original story while adding various subplots along the way. Overall it works even if it does seem to veer offtrack at a few points.These films were produced at breakneck speed it was not uncommon for three Holmes films to be released in a single year with fairly low budgets but Roy William Neill knew how to achieve great results with his limited resources. As with its immediate predecessors the camerawork in The Pearl of Death is strong and evocative the direction is confident and effective and the performances are at least for the most part fine to excellent. Rathbone's Holmes is once again in his proper element here and Rathbone makes the most of the character.The Pearl of Death is just a step below The Scarlet Claw in my estimation...which still makes this outing quite enjoyable. Anyone who liked The Spider Woman Sherlock Holmes Faces Death or The House of Fear will definitely appreciate this one. Out of the dozen Holmes films that Universal churned out between 1942 and 1946 this is one of the eight that I would say deserve to be called great.".

I was impressed by Basil Rathbone's characterization of Holmes he consistently utters lines that coming from an inferior actor would probably sound ridiculous yet he manages probably because this was his sixth turn at the character to impress me with his believability and sheer presence on the screen. Until I saw this film I was always irritated by Nigel Bruce's bumbling Dr. Watson whose character is miles away from the Watson portrayed in the books but I now realize that he was the perfect foil for Rathbone's Holmes. The updating of Holmes into the modern era also troubles me but the film manages to maintain a kind of 'timeless' quality by avoiding too many 'modern' references. Virgil Miller's cinematography  is beautiful I would hate to see it Colorized by Turner and his evil band.

The story while only containing elementsthe pearl the Napoleon busts of the original story moves very quickly though not feeling too rushed and is always engaging with great suspense and sense of mystery. The acting is strong the most memorable being Rondo Hatton who is just spinechilling as the Creeper having seen this at about 11 years old and having vague memories of that viewing it was Hatton that I remembered the most vividly. Basil Rathbone is spoton as Holmes as he always was cunning and very wellread with a touch of humour about him Pearl of Death also has some of his best deductions of the series. Nigel Bruce is amusing as Watson and he does bring some loyalty to counterpoint with Rathbone's Holmes though the character can be too much of an idiot in this series and at times that is true here. His chemistry with Rathbone still convinces there really is a great dynamic between them. Lestrade is even more so the character was always inept but this Lestrade really is as thick as a brick like with Watson the writing of the characters is part of why that is. Dennis Hoey is very funny though and seems to be really enjoying himself. Evelyn Ankers is very attractive with great disguises she makes for a striking and stronglyacted accomplice. Miles Mander is not quite as good as the rest he is menacing in a quiet and subtle sense without falling into total blandness which is a good approach if not quite distinguishing himself in the climax especially compared to Hatton one rare case where the henchman actually eclipses the mastermind. In conclusion an entertaining and atmospherically effective Sherlock Holmes mystery Hatton's Creeper makes the film. If you are a purist though and want a more faithful adaptation of the story watch The Six Napoleons with Jeremy Brett as Holmes as part of the Granada series even better than this and one of the best of that series. 810 Bethany Cox".

The pearl of course is the cursed Borgia Pearl an object of rich men's lust.

The Borgia Pearl has been the object of criminal stratagems since it arrived in London for display in the British Museum.

But what happens when Sherlock Holmes Basil Rathbone apparently makes a mistake. And what happens when the electricity doesn't work. It will be Sherlock Holmes aided by his game but confused partner Watson Nigel Bruce against Giles Conover. Holmes makes his disdain for Conover clear. I don't like the smell of you  an underground smell the sick sweetness of decay. You haven't robbed and killed merely for the game like any ordinary halfway decent thug. No you're in love with cruelty for it's own sake. Little does Holmes realize that Conover has a creature of his own...a brute whose face is the result of a disorder of the pituitary gland. Watson might call it acromegaly. Most laymen would say it's the Easter Island Statue Syndrome. It's not long before Holmes must deal not only with Conover but also with this creature...the Hoxton Creeper Rondo Hatton. A monster Watson Holmes says with the chest of a buffalo and the arms of a gorilla. His particular method of murder is back breaking. And it's always the same...the third lumbar vertebrae. How horrible says Watson. Does Sherlock Holmes best the Creeper? Does he recover the Borgia Pearl? Does Conover taste the bitter brew of utter defeat? You'll get no spoilers from me. Some think macaroni and cheese is the perfect comfort for what ails you. I think it's Rathbone and Bruce. People can argue about which actor has been the best Sherlock Holmes but there is something about Rathbone's style earnestness profile and line delivery that makes me sit back and smile every time I watch him play The Great Detective. All that Victorian gaslight fog and cobblestones help too. With some strange alchemy the Holmes movies with Rathbone have turned into an elixir of kitsch style remembrance of things past satisfaction and noble causes. Mac and cheese doesn't come close.".

As he and his loyal companion Watson get stuck in to the case it's evident that the perpetrator has brains to match his undoubted daring. Backed up by a menacing thug known only as the Creeper this criminal may just have enough about him to evade capture by Holmes and his bag of wily tricks.Very loosely based on the Arthur Conan Doyle short story The Six Napoleans it's probably best to just judge this delightful Holmes adventure as a standalone picture. All the usual ingredients that made this franchise so rewarding are here mystery at every turn a perpetual sense of adventure and of course the quite wonderful chemistry between Basil Rathbone's Sherlock and Nigel Bruce's Dr Watson. Here the pair are backed up by Miles Mander Evelyn Ankers Ian Wolfe and the always enjoyable Dennis Hoey as Inspector Lestrade. But I promise that the most memorable performance you will come away with in this picture is that from Rondo Hatton as The Creeper barely seen outside of a darkened moving shadow once this hulking creeping menace is revealed it has quite an impact. Hatton is perfectly cast as he was always effective as the muscle character check out In Old Chicago 1937 for another memorable little turn.I always find with the Holmes series that the films are only as good if their villains are memorably bad I like the villains here and come the obviously inevitable finale I feel that you can't possibly feel let down. 70 minutes of entertainment just fly by it may not be one for the Conan Doyle purists but in the context of the franchise it works rather well. 7.510".

I would welcome a little more humility and patience in Holmes.  Bruce plays Watson as a bit of a buffoon and although unfair to the character he is amusing and lightens proceedings.  Likewise all policemen are foolish and comical.   Mander is a good villain but somehow you never feel like he could overcome Holmes but Hatton as the Creeper has walked onto the set from a horror film or something and is far too ghoullike to be just a dangerous criminal.That said this is enjoyable none the less and fans of this Holmes series will like this.  It is constructed well with only the few weaknesses towards the end in the shape of the creeper.".

It happened the 'Carry On' films with 'Cleo' and the Bunuellian masterpiece 'Up the Khyber'.

There is a clever plot with some good twists and a particularly charmless villain.  Director Neill does what he can with a limited budget creating atmosphere menace and tension through camerawork rather than expensive period sets.  Normally this is about all you'd get from the series.  But 'Pearl' offers something more.  Most Holmes plots are bizarre enough until explained away but there is a Chestertonian absurdity to this one of a priceless murderous jewel secreted in one of six busts of Napoleon that hints at a peculiarly English kind of nonsense of dream verging on nightmare.  Once again Holmes' disguises are ritualised the emphasis on acting on playing a part of shifting unreliable identities.  We must remember that this film was made in 1944 the height of the Second World War.  Conan Doyle's story was written in 1903 before any world war. Comparing film and story is instructive.  In the story a not hostile Lestrade comes to Holmes with an unusual case which with a few interviews some casual racism inductive reasoning and supreme detachment the great detective solves.  Here however Holmes is the source of the crime the mystery the five murders.  It is his unwitting Watsonlike dismantling of the security system that enables Giles Conover to steal the jewel.  Conover is thus in a sense Holmes' double committing his crimes maybe a Freudian emanation of the Id.  This is a world as yet unknown to Doyle a world where moral certainties have so collapsed that even Holmes now facilitates thieves and murderers.  Conan Doyle's Holmes is the true Enlightenment man hiding his decadent taste for cocaine and atonal violins by reason by his assurance that the world can be explained that knowledge can be transmitted and the world made a safer even better place.  One person as responsible for this ideology as anyone was Dr. Johnson whose great Dictionary is one of the major Enlightenment artefacts.  Here this very book conceals a weapon intended to kill Holmes there is some lovely comedy and suspense here as an unaffectedly curious Watson tries to open it.  Similarly Watson as a doctor represents progress through science.  And yet the chief agent of evil in this film is a hideous deformed convict halfman halfbeast the Creeper a Yahoolike monster that Enlightenment man would deny Lestrade thinks him dead and yet who keeps resurfacing there's class stuff too  Conover and the Creeper go through the servants entrance on their way to the final bust his accomplice holds a number of menial jobs.  The climax is more suited to a horror movie that great genre of reason breaking down with its allusions to Poe its monster and Holmes as a mad scientist lying in wait a powerful allegory of the struggle between bestiality reason and murder taking place in Europe perhaps why the 'Six Napoleons' story was chosen alluding to another charismatic continentdominating lunatic.  Holmes' final generic summation may have been intended as propaganda but its tone and content is pessimistic even defeatist not even Holmes is sure evil can be vanquished.  Extraordinary stuff.".

But since this valuable jewel has to be guarded of course Holmes is on the same ship and in another fabulous disguise as an elderly clergyman recovers it from clever Naomi.So it's finally placed in its 'uniquely' guarded place in the museum  and the director lets Watson who's got his doubts about its safety demonstrate how his security system works as soon as Watson takes the pearl away from its cushion the alarm bells ring and all doors and windows are automatically shut! But a little later when Holmes Watson and the director are discussing the security matter again in his office Holmes turns the tables and demonstrates to HIM that his system is not at all that safe because it's all connected by only three little wires which Holmes disconnects in order to show the security flaws to the director  BUT in those few minutes until the system is restored a member of the gang disguised as a worker manages to get away with the priceless pearl for once the great Sherlock Holmes has embarrassed himself most terribly...And so the hunt for the pearl which must be hidden somewhere begins  but it isn't called the 'Pearl of Death' by pure chance in the many centuries since it belonged to the infamous Borgias it has brought death upon many people and it continues to do so. Very soon a series of murders begins with the victims having no relation whatsoever with each other or the pearl  but all bear the same cruel 'handwriting' of the murderer their backs are all broken at exactly the same spot the method a demented mass murderer who's believed dead by the police by now used years ago. And there's another thing the scenes of all crimes have got in common around all the victims whole heaps of broken china are scattered...A very intriguing entertaining case with many unusual features Holmes the great PERFECT detective makes a vital mistake for the first time without which the whole story wouldn't even have happened the ending is made up of a very cunning psychological trick instead of the usual chase scene and another thing Evelyn Ankers who usually played the frightened heroine in Universals thrillers and horror movies gets an opportunity here to show MUCH more of her talent in various disguises and most of all as the reckless femme fatale fit for any Film Noir of the time! This is definitely one entry in the RathboneBruce 'Holmes' series that not only Sherlock Holmes fanatics will find enormously interesting thrilling and entertaining...".

Very soon a series of murders begins with the victims having no relation whatsoever with each other or the pearl  but all bear the same cruel 'handwriting' of the murderer their backs are all broken at exactly the same spot the method a demented mass murderer who's believed dead by the police by now used years ago. And there's another thing the scenes of all crimes have got in common around all the victims whole heaps of broken china are scattered...A very intriguing entertaining case with many unusual features Holmes the great PERFECT detective makes a vital mistake for the first time without which the whole story wouldn't even have happened the ending is made up of a very cunning psychological trick instead of the usual chase scene and another thing Evelyn Ankers who usually played the frightened heroine in Universals thrillers and horror movies gets an opportunity here to show MUCH more of her talent in various disguises and most of all as the reckless femme fatale fit for any Film Noir of the time! This is definitely one entry in the RathboneBruce 'Holmes' series that not only Sherlock Holmes fanatics will find enormously interesting thrilling and entertaining...";

However I found that a little bit too much of the focus was on Bruce. That's not always a bad thing but here he really didn't have much to do. Watching him paste clippings in a book for several minutes isn't the most entertaining thing in the world. My only complaint with the supporting cast is I would have liked more Evelyn Ankers. Other than that they're fine. The story is good and it's nice to see Holmes fail on occasion as he does in the beginning of The Pearl of Death. In fact it's an incredible change of pace to see Holmes make such a gargantuan mistake that ends up costing several people their lives.".

	schema:reviewBody "For those who have a hard time remembering which of the RathboneBruce Sherlock Holmes pictures is which this is the one with Rondo Hatton as the creeper. It's an excellent entry in the series with some bright dialog for Rathbone more supercilious here than usual and an excellent plot derived from a Conan Doyle original. This one feels longer than it is as the plot is fairly convoluted though not in a bad way. There's no Professor Moriarity on hand in this one and no Atwill Daniell or Zucco either. One has to settle for Miles Mander instead. I have a fondness for Mander as an actor and I'm not sure why and while I wouldn't say that he appeared exclusively in good movies he did appear in a high percentage of my favorite ones.

He needed an assistant like the hulking Hatton to do his dirty work as he seemed incapable of doing it himself. Poor Hatton was a real life victim of acromegaly which accounted for his grotesque appearance which the movie studios exploited rather cruelly I think and which certainly saved them in the makeup department as Hatton was frightening looking without.

It's an excellent entry in the series with some bright dialog for Rathbone more supercilious here than usual and an excellent plot derived from a Conan Doyle original. This one feels longer than it is as the plot is fairly convoluted though not in a bad way. There's no Professor Moriarity on hand in this one and no Atwill Daniell or Zucco either. One has to settle for Miles Mander instead. I have a fondness for Mander as an actor and I'm not sure why and while I wouldn't say that he appeared exclusively in good movies he did appear in a high percentage of my favorite ones.

Here we are with mid 1970s Russian version and in my opinion it is worth watching. Lots of things go against this film  well how easy was to create an authentic atmosphere of the medieval England in the 1970s Soviet Union. Not very easy at all.

The plot is a version of a familiar story so not too many surprises there. All in all the film to me always looked a bit weak with few brighter spots e.g. evil knight casting and performance but the songs of Vysotsky are good songs. At times they fit well and at times they are dissonant with what's on the screen but no matter they definitely add a dimension to the movie itself. There is something in the scenes very akin to Taganka theatrical mood of the time.The first cinema release did not contain the songs there were simply cut off subsequently everything was restored so if you come across the butchered version it's not worth looking at.Where is the release with the subtitles you might want to ask?

	schema:reviewBody "First and foremost I appreciate Dutta's good intentions of exposing today's generation to the beauty of Urdu Zabaan and Lakhnawi Tehzeeb. It takes courage to do an Urdu film in an age where Hinglish is fast becoming the linguafranca of people. It's a pleasure to hear the main characters of Umrao Jaan mouth dialogue in chaste Urdu. The problem is that except a few  Shabana Azmi and Aishwarya Rai who has evidently worked hard on her diction  no other actor can carry it off. And at many places the 'Lakhnawi' flavour of the language is missing. And even chaste Hindi words like 'MaanMaryada' creep into the dialogue at times.Next the production values of the film are quite good. The sets are opulent the costumes and jewellery exquisite. While the film is a visual delight the objective of recreating 19th century Lucknow is not achieved. Nawab Sultan dons a Pathani look Faiz Ali is more Afghani and despite J.P Dutta's best effort the Rajasthani element ends up making brief yet damaging appearances in the art decoration. The narration of Umrao's story demands a bit of 'thehrav' a relaxed unfolding of events. That calls for some patience on the part of the audiences who are used to instant gratification. However I think J.P Dutta got carried away and completely forgot that a slow film need not be boring. Some of the sequences are so long drawn out that one loses interest after a while. When Nawab Sultan returns to the kotha in a drunken state his scene with Umrao takes boredom to new heights. I wouldn't mind even a 15 minute scene where Umrao and Nawab might just exchange poetry or converse in highflown Urdu. But here there is no poetry to appreciate there's no delicacy of zabaan to relish and there's really nothing consequential going on. It hurts. The film is so long that by the time the film ends it seems that you've been sitting at the theatre for ages. I did not get bored because I was carefully listening analyzing and appreciating the language of the film. But for someone who does not appreciate Urdu it can be quite a torture.I am probably one of the very few people who have liked Anu Malik's music in Umrao Jaan. After watching the film people are cursing the movie even more because they think the songs add unnecessarily to the length of the film. I disagree with this. The songs and the lyrics are the highlights of this film. Instead of dialogue the narrative moves through songs. If Umrao wants to say something she says it through a ghazal remember Ruswa's Umrao is a poetess. I also think very highly of Vaibhavi Merchant's choreography. Her steps movements and gestures are full of ada as one would expect in a film about a 19th century 'tawaif'.Aishwarya looks stunning as Umrao Jaan. And it is also evident that she has worked hard on her performance and dialogue delivery. I always considered her as a beautiful face with no acting talent. But in Umrao Jaan she is quite good if only by her standards. So while it cannot be rated as a great performance in absolute terms coming from Ash it certainly is a good job. Sadly Abhishek disappoints big time. And I wouldn't only blame the script for that. His performance is very flat something one doesn't expect from an actor who has shown considerable improvement over the years. The only actor who is consistently good in the film is Shabana Azmi what else did you expect? The film's biggest drawback is it's script. J.P Dutta's film follows the same narrative structure as the book where in her twilight years Umrao Jaan tells the story of her life to the author  Ruswa. In that respect J.P Dutta tries to be truer to the book than Muzaffar Ali's 1981 version. I was quite pleased with the way J.P Dutta chose to start his film. However the changes introduced later and the confused characterisation spoil what could've been a great film. I'm all for making changes to literary works to suit the medium of celluloid so long as it doesn't alter the spirit of the original writing. But Dutta goes a step further and creates a few entirely new events to add twists to the story. These changes do not add to the film in fact they drastically change some of the important characters.The main problem with Dutta's script is that most characters have either not been properly developed or altered significantly. Gauhar Mirza Puru Raj Kumar Bismillah Divya Dutta Khursheed Ayesha Jhulka Faiz Ali Suneil Shetty  all had significant roles to play in the literary Umrao's life but in the film all except Faiz Ali get very marginal roles almost as if their presence was only incidental. Even Faiz Ali's character has been changed drastically. Except the fact that he's a dacoit who Umrao elopes with every single aspect of his character and role have no relation to Ruswa's story. Ditto with Gauhar Mirza. The only character who comes across just the way Ruswa envisioned is Khanum played with characteristic ease by Shabana Azmi.On the whole while J.P Dutta's Umrao Jaan has some positive aspects to it it doesn't come across as a genuine attempt at recreating Ruswa's novel. And the length of the film just kills it!".

	onyx:emotionText "First and foremost I appreciate Dutta's good intentions of exposing today's generation to the beauty of Urdu Zabaan and Lakhnawi Tehzeeb. It takes courage to do an Urdu film in an age where Hinglish is fast becoming the linguafranca of people. It's a pleasure to hear the main characters of Umrao Jaan mouth dialogue in chaste Urdu.

	schema:headline " Umrao Jaan could have hit the mark but missed it by a wide margin";
	schema:reviewBody "I have just watched J.P. Dutta's remake of the classic Umrao Jaan from 1981 and I find that there's a lot to say about it not all of which is very positive.To begin with however I will say that Aishwarya Rai's performance was very good in the film. She has been called a wooden faced actor in the past and has also been credited with no more than four facial expressions that she can use in her performance. But in Umrao Jaan Aishwarya seems to have matured greatly. Her performance captured Umrao Jaan's maddening joy at finding love and then her confusion despair the betrayal she felt and the ultimate resignation to fate when she realizes that she's lost everything. If Rai's acting seems repetitive or slightly tired at times this can mostly be attributed to less than perfect direction from J.P. Dutta and many other actors in the film have also failed to deliver the best they could for this very reason.Abhishek Bachchan who is now a very versatile actor delivered a rather forgettable performance in the film. He was slightly awkward in his screen movements seeming uncomfortable in some of the indoor settings and as the first and biggest love of Umrao Jaan's life he did injustice to the role. His acting was so understated that it prevented viewer identification with the character. He could not evoke an emotional response in any of his scenes least of all in his last scenes in the plot where the anger resentment and resolute cold hearted rejection of Umrao Jaan by her lover came across only as petty tantrum thrown by an adolescent.Mostly however these flaws in the film could have been prevented if J.P. Dutta had kept a firm grip over the screenplay over the editing and over the number of people in the cast. It seems that with too much to direct by himself Dutta could not do full justice to many parts of the film and veteran actors like Shabana Azmi Himani Shivpuri and Divya Dutta directed themselves to fill in the gaps in the director's frenzied vision.There are too many actors in the film fighting for screen space so much so that no one except a few make any impact. This has been a problem with a couple of Dutta's other films too namely Border and LoC where the script was crowded with far more characters than required and too many well known actors played them on screen.The screenplay for Umrao Jaan should have been tighter. Dutta does not find a good mix of emotions here. The first part of the film's story is almost entirely neutral or happy with viewers waiting for some dramatic tension or conflict to appear. Umrao Jaan's and Nawab Sultan's courtship is dragged on for scene after scene until just before the interval where we see some action beginning to happen. The remainder of the film is then entirely sad. The length of the film makes these polarities stand out even more and the transition from the best time of her life to the worst is too slow to happen and then very suddenly accomplished.Most importantly it seems that Dutta could not resist the temptation to put in everything that he had shot. This film sorely needs stricter editing. Perhaps it is because Dutta has edited it himself that one finds too many unnecessary scenes in the film. If he had had an impartial editor do the job it would not have been botched up out of sentimental attachments to the 'director's baby'. Martin Scorsese when he went to the cinema with his friends realised that if the viewers laugh at some point at which they're not meant to then obviously the film has gone wrong there. I found the entire theatre howling with laughter at many scenes that were not meant to be funny at all. In particular three crucial scenes in the film one in which Nawab Sultan goes to Umrao drunk and on the defensive. He then chooses to misunderstand her concern for him as pity. This scene dragged on for so long that the audience started picking on the dialogue and laughing at all the inappropriate times. Another scene where Faiz Ali finds Umrao unresponsive to his love so he rips her clothes off and then screams in anguish evoked guffaws louder than the character's own enraged cries. And finally after enduring the film for ever so long the audience had no sympathy for Umrao at the end when after her last mujra the whole court is in stunned silence for a minute. At this point all that the audience sitting behind me could think of was how ridiculous all the people looked sitting on the floor with their heads hung low.And to add a last point to my argument where the director paid attention to such exquisite and minute details as far as the beautiful period sets and costumes were concerned there he failed to spot a most obvious gaffe. Suniel Shetty appears in one scene in which the camera is positioned so that his feet are in the centre of the frame to be wearing regular 21st century rubber soled and heeled lace up shoes. Apart from this there were plenty of scenes were one could see the adhesive strips on fake beards mustaches and wigs.But despite all the flaws in the film it was visually stunning. A real treat for the eyes. I would recommend that people watch Umrao Jaan to admire the beautiful and opulent period detail and Aishwarya Rai.".

It makes me wonder if they watched the entire movie as the ending scenes are among the best ever filmed. For cultural reference and point of view I am a 35 year old American male living in the United States and a fan of any good film. This movie is incredible and an achievement in Bollywood film. There have been some really great movies coming out of Bollywood and some great nonBollywood is Black and Raincoat recently such as Devdas and Lagaan. Both of those movies really showed off the best elements of typical BW but both also had at least a little of the well cheese or melodrama that tends to show up in the standard Bollywood movie. Umrao Jaan had no melodrama and hardly any comic relief either. The music and dancing element that is a staple of BW and in most movies seems to come out of nowhere was here given a foundation in reality and a reason for existence due to the main character's profession. Speaking of the main character Aishwarya Rai as Umrao Jaan herself was perfect casting and she did an incredible job at real acting and never once hinted at melodrama. Most of the musical numbers belonged exclusively to Rai and in fact she was in almost every shot in the entire movie.One of the complaints is that this movie is too long. It was not too long but rather pretty average for BW as it is only a few minutes longer than Devdas and is in fact shorter than Lagaan at the time of this writing the run time was not given on IMDb.com but my watch indicated about 210 minutes including intermission time. Another complaint is that it has too many songs. It did not have too many  there were six I believe which is about average for BW and each one played an important part  especially the first and last songs in the movie. Besides their importance the performances of the musical numbers were absolutely incredible  most of this was achieved on the shoulders of Rai  and after each musical number I seriously couldn't wait for the next one hoping it would again feature Rai. Additionally the songs themselves were absolutely amazing and fresh real talent was behind the scenes here. The performance by Rai in the musical numbers was to me what completed the entire film.I called this movie an achievement because it features only the BEST elements of BW while incorporating things that are new and different from the typical BW feature that only uplift it's credibility reality and entertainment value. The goal of the BW film is to transport the viewer to another reality and this one does it better than any I've seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Poor Aishwariya Rai. To have had to suffer the indignity of being the most beautiful woman in the world. It may sound like I'm being excessively sarcastic but you're only half right. Rai like many other actors before her has had to contend with preconceived notions of her artistic abilities. What makes her unique is that she has also had to contend with the very thing which has brought her so much international attention her looks.Unlike India's other major screen mavens renowned for their beauty Madhubala Rekha and Manisha Koirala among them Rai's ethereal charms have consistently been lodged against her as proof that she is nothing but a plastic mannequin with the emotional range of a Barbie Doll. And until recently her detractors have largely been right.Bhansalli's Hum Dil Dechuke Sanam for all its puerility showed that Rai deserved the title of performer if not actress. His followup the heinous melodramatic bloat called Devdas gave a glimpse into what was possible for Rai under the right setup she was and remains the only thing worth watching in a film that should have been called Paro. And now Umrao Jaan finally brings the inner being out which pronounces the arrival of Aishwariya Rai the actress. While one may question J.P. Dutta's motives for filming a story already memorialized as a classic one does not question his casting of the lead. As AmeeranUmrao Jaan Aishwariya at last achieves that elusive but indispensable acting necessity emotional nudity. Regardless of whether one agrees with the film or the character she cannot be faulted for turning in a hollow soulless or canned performance. Here she is fully in character physically aesthetically emotionallyeven psychologically. And while the film is melodramatic Rai is decidedly not. She delivers the superficial necessities of the eponymous courtesanbreathtaking beauty and grace and dances which are embodiments of bothbut her performance is never subdued by the surface features of Umrao Jaan. Witness the scene in which she is repudiated by her aristocratic lover in his drunken stupor the dual conjuring of disbelief and anger as she spits out the refrain Vah Re Kismat Oh Fate. is perfect in its subtlety. Barely moving her lips to deliver the curse of her fate Rai demonstrates that she is capable of much more than is customarily delegated her way.The film features a few lightweight actors like Sunil Shetty who is woefully wooden and miscast. One cannot help but pine for a menacing Shah Rukh Khan or a grunting Abhishek Bachchan in the part of Faiz Ali. Bachchan is of course present as Nawab Sultan Umrao Jaan's only true love. Sadly he delivers an uninspired portrayal of an aristocrat tormented by his desire for a courtesan. Dutta's casting is way off here as well. Sultan is frankly the kind of part screaming to be played by Ajay Devegan or Akshaye Khanna.Much has been made of the fact that Shabana Azmi is playing the part of brothel keeper which her mother played in the 1981 film. Unfortunately Dutta conceptualizes the part from a much more clichd stock mother stereotype which lacks the bite and deformed morality which made the original so interesting. Perhaps a Rekha or Sridevi would have made the part more deliciously dramatic making this a film about the forging and destroying of female bonds in a misogynistic world rather than a romanticized portrayal of prostitution which ignores the fundamental questions of a womanidentified sanctuary for women in 19th century India. We'll have to wait until the story is absorbed by experimental feminist cinemaoddly enough Muzaffar Ali's film deals with these issues rather lucidly. One thing I'd love to see is an adaptation by a female director Mira Nair or Deepa Mehta could work unique wonders with such a story.But back to Dutta. The main drawback of his film is its script. It is constructed as a chaptered retelling of the life of Umrao Jaan who recounts her memorable journey to the man who would later memorialize her in print. The film revolves around a hohum love story thrown on top of an absolutely awful introduction in which the kidnapped Ameeran inexplicably accepts her place in the brothel because it offers her material opulence. How many sheltered 10yearold girls will accept the position of prostituteintraining? Not many I'm glad to say but Dutta's film explains away the young victim's angst or torment as though she had been peddled off for a day at a carnival. Whatever the realities of life were for 19th century working class girls the flippant caricature offered by Dutta was most definitely not it.Comparisons between Dutta's and Ali's films are difficult to maintain yet unavoidable. The plotcharacterizations are sufficiently different yet one cannot help but think of the peerless Rekha as Umrao Jaan. Despite Rai's earnest performance designer costumes and modernized mujras Rekha continues to literally own Umrao Jaan. Few scenes can compare to Rekha's wordless devastation in the moment her lover has come to invite her to his wedding. Her longing yearning and rage all rally in her eyes as angry tears and she tears away Sultan's shirt without revealing the heart she longed to conquer. Not a single moment in Dutta's film approaches the depth of this scene and so Dutta will have to settle for the embrace of the moment if not of history.The same holds for the film's music Anu Malik's compositions are fine works of music no doubt but there are frankly too many of them and offer little range. Javed Akhtar's lyrics however deserve special mention particularly the final lament Poochrahe Hain Poochnewale. The final stanza of Patthar Ab Kya Phenk Raheho Hum Pehlese Zakhmi Hain Why do you cast your stones when I am already wounded? bespeaks the brilliance that should have been. Alas.And so the final word is that Aishwariya is a revelation but the film tells us something we already know a classic cannot be remade.".

	onyx:emotionText "Poor Aishwariya Rai. To have had to suffer the indignity of being the most beautiful woman in the world. It may sound like I'm being excessively sarcastic but you're only half right. Rai like many other actors before her has had to contend with preconceived notions of her artistic abilities. What makes her unique is that she has also had to contend with the very thing which has brought her so much international attention her looks.Unlike India's other major screen mavens renowned for their beauty Madhubala Rekha and Manisha Koirala among them Rai's ethereal charms have consistently been lodged against her as proof that she is nothing but a plastic mannequin with the emotional range of a Barbie Doll. And until recently her detractors have largely been right.Bhansalli's Hum Dil Dechuke Sanam for all its puerility showed that Rai deserved the title of performer if not actress. His followup the heinous melodramatic bloat called Devdas gave a glimpse into what was possible for Rai under the right setup she was and remains the only thing worth watching in a film that should have been called Paro. And now Umrao Jaan finally brings the inner being out which pronounces the arrival of Aishwariya Rai the actress. While one may question J.P. Dutta's motives for filming a story already memorialized as a classic one does not question his casting of the lead. As AmeeranUmrao Jaan Aishwariya at last achieves that elusive but indispensable acting necessity emotional nudity. Regardless of whether one agrees with the film or the character she cannot be faulted for turning in a hollow soulless or canned performance. Here she is fully in character physically aesthetically emotionallyeven psychologically. And while the film is melodramatic Rai is decidedly not. She delivers the superficial necessities of the eponymous courtesanbreathtaking beauty and grace and dances which are embodiments of bothbut her performance is never subdued by the surface features of Umrao Jaan. Witness the scene in which she is repudiated by her aristocratic lover in his drunken stupor the dual conjuring of disbelief and anger as she spits out the refrain Vah Re Kismat Oh Fate. is perfect in its subtlety. Barely moving her lips to deliver the curse of her fate Rai demonstrates that she is capable of much more than is customarily delegated her way.The film features a few lightweight actors like Sunil Shetty who is woefully wooden and miscast. One cannot help but pine for a menacing Shah Rukh Khan or a grunting Abhishek Bachchan in the part of Faiz Ali. Bachchan is of course present as Nawab Sultan Umrao Jaan's only true love. Sadly he delivers an uninspired portrayal of an aristocrat tormented by his desire for a courtesan. Dutta's casting is way off here as well. Sultan is frankly the kind of part screaming to be played by Ajay Devegan or Akshaye Khanna.Much has been made of the fact that Shabana Azmi is playing the part of brothel keeper which her mother played in the 1981 film. Unfortunately Dutta conceptualizes the part from a much more clichd stock mother stereotype which lacks the bite and deformed morality which made the original so interesting.

Shabana Azmi Sunil Shetty Abhishek Bachchan and all the other actors shine in their characterizations. Anu Malik's music is superb and perfectly fits with the dance sequences. Overall I thought the film really did justice to the classic 1981 version  updating it and adding terrific song and dance sequences. Both versions tell a powerful story.

The worst comment that i could give on this film is that the first half is n a different class to the second half as it took a while for me to start thinking about what i was seeing however the second half definitely makes up for it. well done Aishwarya!".

Although Dutta claimed to have based the film on the novel it is clearly more a remake of the 1981 film version directed by Muzaffar Ali and starring Rekha. The 1981 film was lavish powerful and beautiful and is a famous musical classic. Rekha's heartfelt performance as Umrao Jaan remains till date one of the finest performances of not only her career but of Indian cinema in general. So obviously one would go on to compare the two versions and needless to say the 1981 film is and will always be associated with this title. This new version is not very bad. It is pleasing to the eye it has some nice songs great costumes and Aishwarya Rai looks impossibly beautiful. However the film is lacking in substance in emotion and it lacks the power to excite.In comparison to Rekha Aishwarya Rai is frankly more of an amateur and I'm not one of those who hate her. Rekha's line delivery her nonverbal emotions her pain her expressive eyes being occasionally filled with tears and above all her dance numbers which are some of the most memorable in the history of Indian films were so soulful. Aishwarya though stunning in looks and evidently trying to do her best simply does not have the ability to recreate this magic. She does have her moments but that's as far as it goes and it is hardly a good performance. Moreover her dance numbers are overly mechanical. Anu Malik's soundtrack is good and the great Alka Yagnik sings the songs beautifully but then again when compared to Khayyam's unforgettable songs performed to perfection by Asha Bhosle in the original version is nothing exceptional. Another much talked about role in the film is that of Khanum Jaan played by Shabana Azmi. Azmi plays a role her own mother Shaukat Azmi played in the original version. She seems to have a lot of fun with the minimal job her character lets her do and surprisingly does not really take her role seriously as she rightly admitted in an interview. That's okay even accomplished actors like Azmi are allowed to have fun and that's what actually makes her portrayal the more so entertaining. As for Abhishek Bachchan the less said about him the better. Even on its own Umrao Jaan does not hold water. It is melodramatic uninspiring and poorly directed. Aishwarya's presence and the film's visuals cannot save it from being just another unsuccessful and forgettable attempt to remake a classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "I happened to watch original Umrao Jann just a few days back by chance and instantly fell for classic movies. As soon as this remake was released i went especially to theater to watch and i didn't regret as it was equally good. Story was not completely a copy of original one instead some more good ideas were added. I think it wont be fair to both REKHA and ASH to compare them with each other as both performed equally well and were a perfect choice for the character as it demanded some thing beyond than just the verbal performance. Songs are really touchy esp SALAAM and JIS ZINDAGE NAY AP SE MILWA DIYA HAMAIN. Though the duration of the movie is too long for the typical Indian movie which is the only notsogood aspect to some extent but if considered it was inevitable for such a story. Its not that Abhishak didn't perform well he did an OK job its just that he doesn't have the typical NAWAB FEATURES or may b we are looking forward to his upcoming DHOOM 2 featuring him as the cool cop so perhaps having that image in mind i just couldn't digest him playing a NAWAB in this movie.

	onyx:emotionText "I happened to watch original Umrao Jann just a few days back by chance and instantly fell for classic movies. As soon as this remake was released i went especially to theater to watch and i didn't regret as it was equally good. Story was not completely a copy of original one instead some more good ideas were added. I think it wont be fair to both REKHA and ASH to compare them with each other as both performed equally well and were a perfect choice for the character as it demanded some thing beyond than just the verbal performance. Songs are really touchy esp SALAAM and JIS ZINDAGE NAY AP SE MILWA DIYA HAMAIN. Though the duration of the movie is too long for the typical Indian movie which is the only notsogood aspect to some extent but if considered it was inevitable for such a story. Its not that Abhishak didn't perform well he did an OK job its just that he doesn't have the typical NAWAB FEATURES or may b we are looking forward to his upcoming DHOOM 2 featuring him as the cool cop so perhaps having that image in mind i just couldn't digest him playing a NAWAB in this movie. Rest the sets were good and the costumes too though the dialogs if written with more depth would have added more to it. Anyway overall everybody did a good job. And one last thingeven if the movie didn't do well on box office Ash should get best actress award this year. What do u say??";

In a rush of making comic action and exotic foreign locale movie this movie is the answer to all those who think the only way of making a good movie is by going to foreign counties and spending big cash with a exaggerated larger than life image to the movie.The biggest heroes of Umraao Jaan are its screenwriter the veteran Mr. O.P. Dutta and the director himself J.P. Dutta music director Anu Malik lyricist Javed Akhthar singer Alka Yagnik choreographers Saroj Khan and Vaibhavi Merchant and of course most importantly Aishwarya Rai. The original story by Mirza Muhammad Hadi Ruswa is bigger than just saying fabulous. Abhishek Bachchan and Shabana Azmi too deliver great performances. Thorugh the only place I find the movie obtrusive is its production design and prop department the rest of the movie is perhaps the best movie of the year. No doubts Aishwarya Rai will be nominated for at least Best Actress this year.So what is bad about this movie.. Well just one fact that the movie is a bit too long and one easily loses patience till he reaches the end. Expect for those dozing heads in the theatre I saw I must say it is a film I really like and though musical classics is not really my cup of tea this one is. If I slightly compare it with Devdas I see Umraao Jaan has got a bit drier texture as Devdas was more juicier.The obvious comparison I would like to draw is with Don that release two weeks ago. Well both are adapted screenplays but see how Don was full of errors while this one Umraao Jaan done by a veteran who has spent about 50 years making movies. Well breathtaking exhilarating and what more I can say? The artists and the producers have made a 100 input and its worthwhile but the question is if today's crowd likes such movies? That now depends upon the public to make this movie a success or a failure.This is a great movie. Go and watch it.".

This is not the type of flick that some people might be used to because this is a classical. And about Ash's acting skills I have to say that this is her best so far. She looks stunning and the dances are superb. I think she deserves to win the Best Actress Award because I haven't seen any other that can measureup to her. This is the best female character this year I can't see no one better for the job than Aishwarya. For all those people who dislikes her and that talk badly about her watch this movie and you will change your mind.

	schema:reviewBody "That's the feeling I had walking away from the cinema after seeing Umrao Jaan last evening. That and the fact that the feeling that Aishwarya Rai has outdone herself with this role. I was completely floored. I have always heard that God would never give one person more than they can bear but with everything that happened to Umrao Jaan in this film just makes you wonder how she could have taken even the first blow. I decided to wait 24 hours before writing my review but even still I have the same feelings. This film was so good and every single person involved with it was in their element! I tip my hat to JP Dutta and his relentlessness in making sure that the film did not go to the dumps in the hands of the detractors. He has proved once again why he is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to directing in Indian Cinema. The Delightful Divya Dutta  Suave Suniel Shetty in a very predictable role costar.It's a very difficult task to outshine someone like Shabana Azmi a woman whose screen presence rivals that of Betty Davis Katherine Hepburn and then some. It is very hard to halt a rolling stone like Abhishek Bachchan whose hurricanelike performances in Sarkar Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna Yuva  Refugee despite his super famous daddy seems to be carving out his own niche in Bollywood. But surprisingly in spite of all of this Aishwarya Rai held her own and then some. She hit it straight into the stratosphere. She CAME She SAW  She CONQUERED as the title character.We meet Umrao as she begins to tell the story of her life to a solicitor and from this flashback we learn the tale of how she was once known as a young girl named Ameeran. She was kidnapped by an enemy of her father's for revenge and sold into a brothel headed by an opium smoking entity of a woman named Khanum Sahib played by the incomparable Shabana Azmi. In this brothel Ameeran receives new parents and is brought up in the life of art music  poetry. Young Ameeran's named is then changed to Umrao and she eventually blossoms into a stunningly ravishing young lady now played by Bollywood's Queen with the bag of tricks Aishwarya Rai. All seems to be going swimmingly well until Umrao meets Nawab Sultan Abhishek Bachchan on the eve of her very first Mujra for the brothel and sparks between them fly. IMHO Umrao the scene in which Umrao looks the most beautiful in the entire film is in that very first scene where the two characters meet. When she lifted her veil the entire audience just gasped I felt so proud of Aishwarya. This meeting would mark the beginning of the end for the woman known as Umrao Jaan as it starts to become apparent from here on that fate has cast an evil eye upon her glory with the events that follow her tempestuous  torrid affair with the infamous Nawab Sultan.Aishwarya Rai has never done a Mujra before for a film and it seemed all the more fitting that she performed many along with her first in this film. Mujra lovers are in for a treat but Mujras aside Aishwarya Rai has given the performance of a lifetime with this role. You have never seen her like this before. She captured the very essence of Umrao Jaan the girl the woman and the legend. For the first time Aishwarya's beauty took a backseat and allowed her to come out of her shell. If she does not win nominations for this role next year then it would be out of pure malice. She nailed it people! She nailed it!".

	onyx:emotionText "That's the feeling I had walking away from the cinema after seeing Umrao Jaan last evening. That and the fact that the feeling that Aishwarya Rai has outdone herself with this role. I was completely floored. I have always heard that God would never give one person more than they can bear but with everything that happened to Umrao Jaan in this film just makes you wonder how she could have taken even the first blow. I decided to wait 24 hours before writing my review but even still I have the same feelings. This film was so good and every single person involved with it was in their element! I tip my hat to JP Dutta and his relentlessness in making sure that the film did not go to the dumps in the hands of the detractors. He has proved once again why he is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to directing in Indian Cinema. The Delightful Divya Dutta  Suave Suniel Shetty in a very predictable role costar.It's a very difficult task to outshine someone like Shabana Azmi a woman whose screen presence rivals that of Betty Davis Katherine Hepburn and then some.

Only towards the end is there any noticeable flow to the story. Casting is fine but Sunil Shetty does not fit the bill of Faiz Ali.The language of Lucknow is Urdu and unlike what some other commentators claim the movie does not employ a correct version of the language. The dialect used by some characters is also incorrect. Dialogues are horrible and Aishwarya's pronunciation of Urdu words is absolutely revolting. Umrao Jaan was an Urdu poetess and Aishwarya does not do her justice. The playback singers however are excellent especially Alka Yagnik.Being a native of Lucknow I know that we do not use Baisa Mausa Apshagun Maan maryada etc especially among Muslim families to which all the movie's characters belong. Yet JP Dutta pays no attention to these important details and the characters continue to use these and other wrong terms.The characters' wardrobe is not comparable to period Lucknow or to Muzaffar Ali's version of the movie despite Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla's involvement.JP Dutta's Umrao Jaan is a low budget pretender of a movie with Aishwarya's looks being the only redeeming factor.Stay away from this film.

Niven and Kerr live a comfortably sterile existence each having a private bedroom and each having a secret lover. Their chauffeur Armstrong and maid Turner are cozy with each other between duties. Niven's brother Coote and his wife Redfern struggle with teenage daughter Geeson's sexual blossoming under the tutelage of scamp Dundas. Evans plays a dotty Lady who is the aunt of Dundas. Some eyecatching titles get the whole thing started with whimsy and it almost flies but it does lack that certain sparkle necessary to become a real classic. Despite the film's title and the billing this is not Kerr's movie. The story primarily revolves around Niven with ample time given to all the other participants. He does a decent enough job though it's sometimes hard to imagine what his lover Demick whose lines of dialogue almost but not quite can be understood sees in him. Kerr looks smashing sometimes resembling 1960's Joan Crawford in long shots with similar beaded gowns and big red hair but her character isn't particularly sympathetic or even likable. She isn't given very much to do but does the little bit of it well. Redfern is appealing and funny in her overwrought reactions to the blunt and unflappable Geeson. Both Geeson and Dundas have eyes that aren't exactly straighton so their kids don't have a chance! Evans comes off as a little forced in her humor and oddball situations. Some of the humor is broad and some of it is subtle and the whole film looks good but it doesn't seem as cohesive as one might wish. Naturally it's dated but can be viewed as a period piece. There's no sex or nudity involved despite the continual partnering of the participants but the subject matter had to have been daring for the time nonetheless hence the avoidance of stating certain things outright in the film. Certainly today there's little if anything to find offensive other than the misuse of Miss Kerr. It was insubstantial andor tasteless roles like this and ones that she turned down rather than play that led her to hang up her acting shingle almost directly afterwards. Niven continued on of course with only the occasional significant role and more often appearing in dreck. Now the film comes off as somewhat charming in spite of the racy issues at hand. It's worth checking out to see a decent British cast some 1960's fashions and a few amusing bits.".

If you enjoy The Importance of being Earnest you might enjoy this film although the settings are in different centuries. It's very funny that the birth control pills keep getting switched for aspirin. Also the surprise pregnancies of a woman with a teenage daughter and of the daughter as well.

If you enjoy The Importance of being Earnest you might enjoy this film although the settings are in different centuries. It's very funny that the birth control pills keep getting switched for aspirin. Also the surprise pregnancies of a woman with a teenage daughter and of the daughter as well.

While birth control pills might have looked VERY different in the UK in the 1960s all the ones I've seen look absolutely nothing like aspirins or vitaminswhich are much much larger. So how could people be replacing another person's birth control pills with aspirins without anyone realizing it? This 1960s sex comedy stars Deborah Kerr and David Niven...both of which made quite a few sophisticated sex comedies in the 1950s and 60s such as the horrible CASINO ROYALE BEDTIME STORY and THE GRASS IS GREENER. In this film Mr. and Mrs. Hardcastle have an open marriage and both have their lovers. In addition Mrs. Hardcastle's niece Judy Geeson is sleeping with her boyfriend. However someone is messing with these ladies' birth control pills and soon complications ensue. Like most of the sex comedies of the era this film talks a lot about sex or more rightly INSINUATING a lot about sex without really showing or saying much at all. Racy stuff for the time...very tame stuff when seen today. So while it portrays folks who have affairs and premarital sex it's done with 60s sensibilitiesbeing both extremely broadminded AND old fashioned at the same time.So is this any good and is it worth seeing? Well at least for me no especially. I might have enjoyed it had it just been more interesting made more sense or made me laugh. Plus and I guess this makes me sound very prudish but I thought the Hardcastles were a pathetic couple...and I really didn't care one bit about what happened with them. What was a kooky sex romp back in the day now just seems dated and subpar despite the bigname stars in it.".

The town priest is encouraging her to look at Brendan Albert Finney a local police officer madly in love with her as a possible husband. But Tara is not in love with him and won't consider it. A second suitor actually commits suicide for the love of her it is supposed. Only when a troupe of actors comes to town does Tara meet someone who interests her. That would be Tom Aidan Quinn a most friendly and engaging gentleman who stars in the troupe's productions. However Brendan is most displeased to have a rival and thwarts Tom's attentions as best he can. Will Tara be able to find happiness? The Irish setting is beautiful as no one can disguise the loveliness of the country. However the story here is most somber. Life in this village is restrictive and sobering with hardly a break for anyone from the harsh realities of life. Penn's Tara is a very worthy lady who defies the odds to keep her son. Finney is wonderfully scary as the policeman who hounds Tara day and night to accept his hand. By contrast Quinn's Tom is a breath of fresh air with his good spirits and funny manners. If you wish to see Ireland and can put up with a story of a depressing nature this is a good view. For although the tale is sad it does have its moments and the scenery is a knockout. Just do not expect a mirthful tale as depicted on the handsome box cover.".

It spends a lot of screen time trying to show how hypocritical all the village folk are as they look down on this poor single mother yet indulge in bad behavior every chance they get. For as we all know from watching many Hollywood movies in the 1950s the world was ruled by silly hypocritical cavemen who forced their oppressive outdated morality on the enlightened young'uns.The main characters are not especially likable and when the single mother develops a new love interest the plot fails to give a convincing reason why the couple would care about each other beyond lust. That makes it very hard to care what happens.Honestly some people might think this movie is OK but very few people will love it.

Like other films that discusses poverty it justifies that the deprived are not always bad and that they have reasonable motives why they do vicious thingsthat they are only victims of circumstances that pushes them to commit crimes. But what is different in this film is that the protagonist Anne is not the usual crime busting type of characters. In fact she is somehow an ally of the criminals because she lets them free and then helps them change. She is not bothers by the idea that she is no longer a policewoman that should keep peace and order in the society alone but instead more if a social worker who even takes care of an old lady who keeps on escaping in the institution she stays at. As if Anne already loses hope in the government that in her own way initiates to change the society.Anne is portrayed as an independent woman . She lives on her own and is supported by no one. She is freewilled and takes matters into her own hands. But still it is seen in the film how she can be incapable for her job. Her colleagues constantly remind her to grow a thicker skin because she gets too emotional and too attached to those whom she encounters. She is too idealistic to find the good in criminals by helping them even off duty.In the aspect of cinematography of the film Dresen together with Michael Hammon the director of photography is very successful in creating the appropriate mood of the film by the establishing shots of the high rise buildings and empty streets of the gloomy city of Rostock. The film has a documentary feel because of the grainy picture. Hammon also gave a more humane touch to the film by using a lot of hand held camera shots as well as tracking and pans. The film is very moving because of the abundant reaction shots which make the audience feel the characters' emotions.The powerful cast even adds the success of the film. It would not have been as successful if not for their marvelous portrayal of their roles. Laila Stieler's screenplay is equally as excellent as all the aspects that made the film possible. It was not at all dragging nor boring. The film proves that social change is still possible with someone like Anne who still do not lose hope in our society.".

It's probably to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil.This film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of Anne a raw recruit into a police squad stationed in the Baltic area.  No attempt is made to glamorise the police.  They are truly down to earth harsh at times and unforgiving  Anne on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition.  Against all rules she sometimes holds back incriminating information found on her strip searches and other investigations.This is not a pleasant film. Not one to relax you.  There is not much feeling of optimism in it.  The police seem to be involved in a losing battle. Tomorrow there will be more bashings more murders more family breakups and more distressed children.  Let's face it.  This is the world we live in.As days go by Anne becomes more intimately involved with the police and with the families they are investigating.  The only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character Benny a 12 year old from a broken family. Anne has her own way of patching things up.  She turns a blind eye to Benny's shoplifting and tries to help him as best she can. I was surprised though that she went so far as to seduce Benny's father.  It set me wondering if it was in consideration of the father or her own needs.  After all the film makes it clear that she was desperately in need of a partner and loving children.Well cast but not my idea of an evening's entertainment".

It's about a princess who disguises herself in the pelt of a goldexcreting donkey to avoid an unpleasant marriage. A notable adaptation was Jacques Demy's 1970 movie starring Catherine Deneuve in the title role.Well it turns out that the Soviet Union made its own version of the story. Oslinaya shkura The Donkey's Hide in English isn't as flashy as the French version but still has lots of charm. The opening and closing scenes with the paintings added a special element to the storytelling. A number of the scenes come across as more slapstick especially the scene with the wicked fairy.I should admit that a number of the scenes made me throw out sarcastic comments like on Mystery Science Theater 3000.

Jackie Kallen made a name for herself as one of the few successful female managers in the history of professional boxing. In the movie's prologue we meet Jackie as a young girl so obsessed with the sport that she spends her off hours at the gym helping her dad train her uncle a fighter who died very early in his career. Years later Jackie on a dare agrees to manage her own player  if only she can find a talent who will be willing to put his life and his career in the hands of an untried but determined woman. She alights on Luther Shaw a drugdealerwithaheartofgold whom she picks up in the nearby projects. Luther is for the most part a fictional character a composite we're told of several of the fighters Kallen led to victory in the ring.Regardless of how much of this is fiction or nonfiction 'Against the Ropes' fails to generate any heat either as a character study or as a human drama. We're supposed to find all this interesting simply because Kallen is an attractive woman trying to prove herself in a man's world. Yet the story is hackneyed the dialogue corny the characters and their conflicts trite and underdeveloped. The Cheryl Edwards screenplay is so sketchy and poorly articulated that we often don't understand why characters are behaving the way they are particularly when it comes to the roughandtumble relationship between Jackie and Luther. One moment they are getting along swimmingly and the next Jackie is strutting around blowing her own horn while Luther sits pouting in the corner. Whole episodes which could have gone a long way towards explaining the characters' motivations seem to have been dropped from the finished product at the last minute. Kallen is obviously a changeofpace role for Meg Ryan who generally plays the innocent ingnue lead in romantic comedies. Yet despite the fact that she is a trifle more serious here and even gets to work with an accent the mark of any 'serious' performer looking to buck up her credentials the movie itself is so lacking in tension and grit and so determinedly upbeat and optimistic that it really doesn't give the actress a whole lot of opportunity to truly stretch those acting muscles. In fact in the final scene the film turns into little more than a vanity production for the waning star. Omar Epps fares a bit better turning in a performance of strength and dignity though the script lets him down by failing to develop his character to any appreciable extent. The one fight scene is only moderately well executed and comes way too late in the film for anyone interested in the sport to still be hanging around ringside at that point. In fact no one comes even close to scoring a knockout blow in 'Against the Ropes'  not Ryan not Epps and certainly not the audience. 'Against the Ropes' is a sucker punch all the way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Meg Ryan plays a Jewish woman from Detroit who strives to become a successful boxing manager despite facing many obstacles including an unscrupulous boxing promoter played by Tony Shalhoub. Against the Ropes looks at the relationship between Kallen and her first professional boxer played by Omar Epps.Against the Ropes is your typical Lifetime movie of the week feature that somehow made it to theaters. It had nice intentions but the film is not very good or strong. The story is very uninspired and it reminded me of Erin Brockovich. Against the Ropes tried too hard to be like Erin Brockovich and other boxing films without really being its own film. Also most of the film is pretty dull and there are no real good performances. Meg Ryan is okay as Jackie Kallen. She was a little weak in the dramatic scenes and sometimes her emotions felt really fake. Her outfits were really trashy and this took away from her already less than stellar performance.Meg Ryan is paired up with Omar Epps and he gives a decent performance. However his chemistry with Meg is really weak. This hurts the film a lot since the whole movie was basically their relationship. Tony Shalhoub gives an okay performance but there really wasn't a lot for his character to do. Charles S. Dutton gives an okay performance as Felix. Again there really wasn't much for his character to do. Dutton also directs the film and he does an okay job. He could have developed the characters a little more and he could have done a better job at capturing the relationship between Jackie and Luther. The film is very predictable and very simple. The boxing scenes are good but they pale in comparison to other boxing films like Rocky. In the end this really is a weak film that's not worth watching. Rating 410".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a huge huge disappointment. It's a lot like a weak boxer. The story starts strong but about halfway into things it loses it's legs. They should have thrown in the towel during the final act because this movie was not holding itself up.It's bad enough that the story has nothing to do with the real life of Jackie Kallen these characters have nothing to do with reality at all. Even as a piece of fiction I couldn't buy what they were doing. The characters black and white good and evil and there's nothing complex about them. This movie doesn't try to challenge you to think at all. Tony Shaloub plays a thinly veiled Bob Erim caricature who is always evil. He's never nice to anyone. Omar Epps plays a thinly veiled James Toney minus Toney's uncontrollable temper and with a much higher IQ. Epps' character Luther Shaw is just a kid who's had a run of bad luck and needs a chance. He's a hero. Ryan is also someone who just needs a chance. He and Ryan's characters have to learn to trust each other believe in themselves and have enough heart to follow their dreams. In this world good always triumphs over evil and people always get their dreams.Here's how Kallen describes the movie on her own siteThe true story of boxing manager Jackie Kallen  dubbed the First Lady of Boxing  a former Detroit TV personality publicist and suburban mom who broke into the predominantly male boxing community and guided the careers of several fighters including champions James Toney and Thomas Hearns. Kallen later went on to become the commissioner of the International Female Boxers Association.This movie is an insult to the sport of boxing. When you think about how low boxing has sunk recently anything that insults boxing has to be absolutely awful. The big fight sequence at the end of the movie has to be one of the worst boxing scenes in the history of the movies. Think of the ridiculous boxing sequences in the later Rocky sequels and then imagine trying to make them even more absurd. The characters do nothing but take cheap shots and then smack each other with devastating blows squarely on the jaw.The saddest thing is the real story of Jackie Kallen would have made a great movie. Meg Ryan portrays her as a spinster working as a secretary for a boxing promoter in Cleveland. The real Jackie Callen was married had a son and was the publicist for the Kronk gym in Detroit. Callen's first big fighter James Toney was from Ann Arbor. The script doesn't even set the story in Michigan where things really happened. In this world there's no Don King no mafia no sleezy gamblers ... it's just not the real world of boxing. There's also no controversial fight between James Toney and David Tiberi. In the real world so many people felt the scoring of that fight was so wrong that the fight must have been fixed. That decision for Toney launched an investigation into boxing by the US Congress. For her part Meg Ryan offers no surprises and just plays another blonde who smiles a lot. Really this is a role that should have been played by Marg Helgenberger of CSI. Ryan is too innocent. Helgenberger would have brought credible toughness and credible sexuality to the role. Charles Dutton is always amazing and Omar Epps looks like an up and coming action star but the script isn't up to their talents. Tony Shaloub also does a lot with a poorly written character.If this movie really had told the real story of Jackie Kallen it would have been worth seeing. Instead it tells a predictable fictional story about unoriginal characters that lack believable human traits.Don't bother.".

I am Charles Dutton's neice and a very big fan of Omar Epps. The movie was very well written and directed and the cast did a fantastic job. Meg Ryan definately played her part and made it be known that there is no such thing as a man's sport. I give the movie it's writers directors and it's cast 2 thumbs up. This will definately be a movie that I will purchase on DVD when it comes out.".

	schema:headline " At Least as Good as Erin Brokovitch";
	schema:reviewBody "Having intensely disliked the last four or five Meg Ryan movies I looked upon viewing Against the Ropes with some trepidation. After all the movie had received terrible reviews both with the critics and with the members of the IMDb. While boxing is my favorite spectator sport I don't like it enough for Pay for View or HBO. So I went into the movie knowing nothing of Jackie Kallen or the accuracy of the film. Maybe that's why I enjoyed Against the Ropes so much. I could appreciate the work Ryan Omar Epps Charles Dutton Timothy Daly and especially Tony Shaloub were putting on the screen. That Dutton directed particularly impressed me. He handles actors and the camera very well has a very good eye for screen composition and color. Ryan's Midwestern accent is at least as plausible as Kurt Russell's in Miracle and Against the Ropes is a more entertaining movie. However the best acting plaudits go to Tony Shaloub as the weaselly fight promoter. Those only familiar with Shaloub's work on Monk or Wings are going to see a completely different side of him. Shaloub is menacing without the use of violence that's not as easy to do as some people might think. The ensemble acting here is even better than Erin Brockovitch another sanitized story so I fail to see why that movie was praised and this one panned. Despite the Hollywood touches this movie is less predictable than either Brockovitch or Twelve Monkeys which both received much better reviews.Against the Ropes motivated me enough to read Jackie Kallen's biography.She's a hottie like Ryan no surprise since that was necessary to get any attention at all in a man's sport. she's also 57 so much for the childhood scene dated 1972 in the beginning and was a successful fight analyst before she became a manager so much for the secretary bit. She's also Jewish three of her gentile champions paraded around the ring with trunks emblazoned with the star of David. Now THAT'S the story I would have liked to have seen. Nonetheless as presented Against the Ropes is worth at least a 7.".

	schema:reviewBody "Boxing is one of the few sports that has transcended well onto the big  screen. Raging Bull Rocky I  II and even 1992's more comedic effort  Diggstown each offered an exciting and or interesting look at the  corrupt gruesome and barbaric sport of boxing. Even less accomplished  films like The Great White Hype and Michael Mann's Ali are still better  than the Major League's Slap Shots or Victory's that other sports have  produced on film. With nary a misstep you could get the impression  that boxing movies were a failsafe option.  That was until now.   New to DVD this week is Against the Ropes a boxing film that is yet  another vehicle to reinvent and reenergize Meg Ryan's persona. This  stab has Meg playing Jackie Kallen a truetolife famous boxing  promoter that used her skills and sex appeal to puncture the male  dominated sports arena. Stuck as an executive assistant Jackie stands  up to the vile boxing promoter LaRocca Tony Shalhoub and ends up  buying a boxers contract for the bargain basement price of a dollar.  Upon attempting to contact her new acquisition Jackie is introduced to  Luthur Shaw Omar Epps who bursts on to the scene to rough up a few  drug users in the rundown apartment complex. Seeing talent in the way  Shaw handled himself Jackie bails him out of jail and offers him a  chance to box professionally which he reluctantly accepts after her  persistent aggression.   With a boxer now under her wings Jackie pursues retired trainer Felix  Reynolds Charles S. Dutton to chisel off the rough edges and make  Shaw the boxer we all know he will end up before we see the first  credit at the ass end of the film.   But things can't be that smooth for Ms. Kallen or they wouldn't have  optioned the story for a movie and obstacles come in the form of  LaRocca's influence on the sport and how he is able to keep Jackie's  fighter to insignificant undercard fights. Jackie's fights with other  venues and boxing promoters to circumvent LaRocca's unfair decision  gets the royal treatment by the sports media and soon her head gets  bigger than most boxing purse payouts. This would then lead to the  anxiety on behalf of Shaw and his eventual run to LaRocca for the  respect money and limelight he thinks he is entitled.  Directed by Charles S. Dutton there's that name again Against the  Ropes is a misfired attempt at what was probably a Seabiscuit type  story of a female breaking in ranks with the big guys. But as the movie  plods along with some unnecessary and almost laughable accents by  Shalhoub and Ryan we find that we don't care about the characters can  see things scenes before they unfold and we are reminded that boxing  can sometimes be more of a who you know rather than what you can do  kind of experience.   Maybe most notable was the effort by Ryan who with last years In The  Cut and now with Against the Ropes is trying to have everyone forget  that she has dimples and is nothing if not for the actors to which she  is surrounded and with all due respect to Omar Epps you are no Tom  Hanks. Where Julia Roberts was a little more effortless in her brazen  role as Erin Brockovich Ryan seems to be trying to hard to reinvent  herself. Her swagger was probably a mock of the real Kallen's walk but  coupled with the heavy deepthroated voice it just doesn't play out as  natural enough and is therefore more distracting than believable.  Also noted are how each of the characters offered nothing new to those  viewers that either watch boxing as a spectator sport or who have  enjoyed boxing films in the past. There is the outformyself promoter  Shalhoub the reporter who is always on the side of the good guys  Tim Daly the trainer you know will get his fighter in shape in  record time.etc. etc. etc. .  So with all this going against it I recognize that this is a boxing  movie and I had hoped that the boxing sequences are exciting enough to  keep us on the edge of our seats and forget all that leads up to them.  Nope. Against the Ropes fails there too. The boxing sequences seem  amateurish in how they were shot and orchestrated. Gone are the  smashing sound effects of body blows and jabs that made Rocky such a  smack to the senses. Instead they are replaced with phantom punches  and screen shots from the cheap seats of a large arena.  Too easy a clich to pass up Against the Ropes is no TKO. Instead I  felt like the experience was a draw put in the hands of corrupt judges  and this judge gives it a thumbs down.".

This would then lead to the  anxiety on behalf of Shaw and his eventual run to LaRocca for the  respect money and limelight he thinks he is entitled.  Directed by Charles S. Dutton there's that name again Against the  Ropes is a misfired attempt at what was probably a Seabiscuit type  story of a female breaking in ranks with the big guys. But as the movie  plods along with some unnecessary and almost laughable accents by  Shalhoub and Ryan we find that we don't care about the characters can  see things scenes before they unfold and we are reminded that boxing  can sometimes be more of a who you know rather than what you can do  kind of experience.   Maybe most notable was the effort by Ryan who with last years In The  Cut and now with Against the Ropes is trying to have everyone forget  that she has dimples and is nothing if not for the actors to which she  is surrounded and with all due respect to Omar Epps you are no Tom  Hanks. Where Julia Roberts was a little more effortless in her brazen  role as Erin Brockovich Ryan seems to be trying to hard to reinvent  herself. Her swagger was probably a mock of the real Kallen's walk but  coupled with the heavy deepthroated voice it just doesn't play out as  natural enough and is therefore more distracting than believable.  Also noted are how each of the characters offered nothing new to those  viewers that either watch boxing as a spectator sport or who have  enjoyed boxing films in the past. There is the outformyself promoter  Shalhoub the reporter who is always on the side of the good guys  Tim Daly the trainer you know will get his fighter in shape in  record time.etc. etc. etc. .  So with all this going against it I recognize that this is a boxing  movie and I had hoped that the boxing sequences are exciting enough to  keep us on the edge of our seats and forget all that leads up to them.  Nope. Against the Ropes fails there too. The boxing sequences seem  amateurish in how they were shot and orchestrated. Gone are the  smashing sound effects of body blows and jabs that made Rocky such a  smack to the senses. Instead they are replaced with phantom punches  and screen shots from the cheap seats of a large arena.  Too easy a clich to pass up Against the Ropes is no TKO. Instead I  felt like the experience was a draw put in the hands of corrupt judges  and this judge gives it a thumbs down.";

The film is entirely superficial throughout and never avoids the chance to have Jackie be a tough b cheerful or c tearful. The biggest way this is a problem is in the character of Jackie at no point did she convince and the result is that at the end when Jackie pops up to give generic advice that turns the fight I almost laughed out loud at the sheer corniness of it. I suppose Dutton must shoulder some blame but to be fair nothing in the script suggests that it wanted to be anything other than glossy pap.And if gloss and superficiality is your aim then I suppose casting Meg Ryan is a good move.

	schema:reviewBody "It is embarrassing to see Hollywood have their hands so deep into a project that you can already tell how the film will end before you even finish watching the opening credits. You could even possibly tell how the film will end and how most of the main conflicts will be resolved from a true Hollywood preview. This is exactly the case with Against the Ropes. While Meg Ryan thinks that she may be shedding her romanticcomedy skin for something a bit more roughly what actually is demonstrated is that Ryan is willing to do any feelgood project. There was nothing gritty or real about this film and in fact should be labeled as a fantasy story. With the fading accent that Ryan produces only brings smiles to most faces the fact that nothing truly bad happens on her road to achieving greatness in a male dominated world is pathetic. The writer of this film same writer as Save the Last Dance doesn't give any honest response to Ryan on her journey to the top. The fighter never looses a fight and Ryan is never stopped from being the best she continually has one good thing happen to her time after time. To me this builds for a trueHollywood story that promises never to change or to bring anything tempting to the screen.I honestly could picture this film as a very gritty portrait of a woman trying to compete in a man's world but instead what was actually shown to me was this laminated piece of fake history that was promoted as the story of Jackie Kallen's life. There was no dark seedy underbelly to this story except for when Ryan moseys her way into the ghetto. In quite possibly one of the most racist scenes of the film Ryan clichs her way into the world of this fighter that is black therefore from the streets. I know that they were trying to build the background to where this unstoppable boxer could come from but to me it has all been done before and better. I thought that the filmmakers even glossed over the ghetto to bring us into this dramatic light. It was not a believable story and ultimately that is what hurt this picture.Outside of this laminated world created there were just so many loose ends that were not even attempted to be closed by anyone in the film. Tim Daly's character was the most simplistic character I have ever seen in a film causing the mere minutes he was in this film to be some of the most catastrophic and confusing ever. Was he in love with Jackie? Did he still hate her at the end? What was he doing most of the time? Then there was actordirector Charles S. Dutton who played double duty in this film and gave us nothing new with his character. Clich after clich Dutton played the exact same boxing coach that has been done time and time again. Does every boxing coach need to be gruff and large? Apparently when you are in Hollywood the answer is yes. The only person that gave some decent effort in this film was Omar Epps whose voice was completely covered by Ryan's lacking appeal. You basically had to look at Epps during this entire film because Ryan's performance gave you splitting headaches. This than caused several problems throughout the film especially the ending. What happened at the end? I can't even count on one hand the number of questions that I had and why oh dear me why Hollywood created this glossed ending that resembled nothing of real life but was destined to give the audience something to tear up about. GET OVER YOURSELF Hollywood. If you want to make a good movie you must show realism not everyone clapping at the end. How many times in real life does this happen? Either way it was despicable and nothing sort of general.Overall this film was a waste of time. If you have seen one sporting film you have seen Against the Ropes. If you have seen two sporting film then I am sorry for you. Sport genres are my least favorite and this is yet another glowing example of why. Cheap characters coupled by a story that seemed more like fairyland instead of reality brought this movie down quite a distance in my book. What is even more appalling is the fact that Jackie Kallen looks nothing like Meg Ryan. Apparently the studios needed someone that would attract people to the film because the STORY ITSELF cannot carry on its own so Ryan was called in to change her image and bring out the worst of the story. I continually kept a keen eye on this movie just to see if Tom Hanks would make an appearance as her dad possibly another boxer or just some random moment to revitalize the RyanHanks appeal but alas it never occurred. It would have helped the film in the long run but instead we found clich after clich was the stronger approach. I am not suggesting this film at all unless you are a diehard Meg Ryan fan and even then I think you will be disappointed.Grade  out of ".

It was not a believable story and ultimately that is what hurt this picture.Outside of this laminated world created there were just so many loose ends that were not even attempted to be closed by anyone in the film. Tim Daly's character was the most simplistic character I have ever seen in a film causing the mere minutes he was in this film to be some of the most catastrophic and confusing ever. Was he in love with Jackie? Did he still hate her at the end? What was he doing most of the time? Then there was actordirector Charles S. Dutton who played double duty in this film and gave us nothing new with his character. Clich after clich Dutton played the exact same boxing coach that has been done time and time again. Does every boxing coach need to be gruff and large? Apparently when you are in Hollywood the answer is yes. The only person that gave some decent effort in this film was Omar Epps whose voice was completely covered by Ryan's lacking appeal. You basically had to look at Epps during this entire film because Ryan's performance gave you splitting headaches. This than caused several problems throughout the film especially the ending. What happened at the end? I can't even count on one hand the number of questions that I had and why oh dear me why Hollywood created this glossed ending that resembled nothing of real life but was destined to give the audience something to tear up about. GET OVER YOURSELF Hollywood. If you want to make a good movie you must show realism not everyone clapping at the end. How many times in real life does this happen? Either way it was despicable and nothing sort of general.Overall this film was a waste of time. If you have seen one sporting film you have seen Against the Ropes. If you have seen two sporting film then I am sorry for you. Sport genres are my least favorite and this is yet another glowing example of why. Cheap characters coupled by a story that seemed more like fairyland instead of reality brought this movie down quite a distance in my book. What is even more appalling is the fact that Jackie Kallen looks nothing like Meg Ryan. Apparently the studios needed someone that would attract people to the film because the STORY ITSELF cannot carry on its own so Ryan was called in to change her image and bring out the worst of the story. I continually kept a keen eye on this movie just to see if Tom Hanks would make an appearance as her dad possibly another boxer or just some random moment to revitalize the RyanHanks appeal but alas it never occurred. It would have helped the film in the long run but instead we found clich after clich was the stronger approach. I am not suggesting this film at all unless you are a diehard Meg Ryan fan and even then I think you will be disappointed.Grade  out of ";

Trust me...I read the book enjoyed the message and was excited to see the movie but then they treated the audience like we are rtarded. There is no story and the story that is there is crippled by too much magic and coincidence. It is too bad they have to spell out the nine prophecies and can't simply weave them into a story that is entertaining to follow. They didn't spend any time on character development and it was easy to not care if any character died. It was embarrassing to be one of the few people who stuck around until the end of this incredibly boring movie. The book is pretty boring too but I enjoyed the parallels that could be seen in everyday life while you read the book. The film does not offer the same opportunity and I would suggest not seeing it if you want to continue to hold the words of the book close to your heart. DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE. Trust me.".

So if you tend to think of yourself as spiritual believe in or at least can tolerate stuff like aura and astral body and don't mind the frequent use of the term energy outside of the context of physics or technology you might actually like the movie and will likely even more enjoy whatever book it is apparently based on.However if you are mostly in touch with the physical universe if your ability to suspend disbelief is easily exhausted by inane New Age nonsense and plots based thereon if in addition to that you have a low tolerance for cheesy lighting effects to denote the happening of spirituality and perhaps even expect reasonable nonwooden dialog an acting then this is my recommendation for you regarding this movie Stay. Away.Don't even think about it. Tonight this movie displaced Dungeons and Dragons as the worst movie I ever personally saw in a movie theater I do not count movies I went to see with the expectation of them being bad such as Plan 9 etc.. At the same time it raised the grand total of movies I almost walked out on to two DD being the other one. I do not walk out on movies not even on this one but I should've when I first saw the visual depiction of an aura because the New Age BS keeps on getting thicker and thicker from that point on.The plot is about a group of people involving themselves with some old prophecies in a quest for spiritual enlightenment and aiming at bringing mankind to the next step in its evolution. Or something like that. They actually talk about this spiritual stuff being the next step in human evolution which should make anybody who has even the faintest idea of what human evolution is cringe. The movie is shock full with whoppers like that. Occasionally people beam to what they would certainly describe as another dimension or perhaps another plane only to become invisible to those around them who haven't yet reached enlightenment. Goodness.At the end the director patronizes the audience by rolling the insights making up the prophecy painfully slow presumably so that we can memorize them and leave the cinema as better more enlightened individuals.Good things about the movie? Some very pretty nature shots and some decent supporting performances by Elizondo and de Almeida.I honestly can say that it seriously affects my ability to take a person seriously if they consider this movie interesting or acceptable. It really is el cheapo spiritualism of the most naive kind and unless that's your thing you better do something else with your time and money.".

Their motivation  objectivity is dubious since they encourage you not to look at the movies faults but at its well intentioned message of New Age consciousness.So would it be alright for some twenty to thirty Evangelical Christians or Islamic Fundamentalists to pour in positive ratings about moviestelevision that support their views? In spite of the poor qualities of production or the lack of truth in any of its supposed historic basis? I hope not.I am sure the followers will come right behind me to say flowery things about this movie in spite of the truth.".

The plot is one that has been recycled countless times.I was only prompted to even spend the time to put in a comment when I noted that some have tried to propup the reputation of this drivel. Their motivation  objectivity is dubious since they encourage you not to look at the movies faults but at its well intentioned message of New Age consciousness.So would it be alright for some twenty to thirty Evangelical Christians or Islamic Fundamentalists to pour in positive ratings about moviestelevision that support their views? In spite of the poor qualities of production or the lack of truth in any of its supposed historic basis? I hope not.I am sure the followers will come right behind me to say flowery things about this movie in spite of the truth.";

It is very clear that the book looses a lot in this movie version. The events that were suppose to show synchronicity taking place are almost unrecognizable. A lot of reasoning has to be done for the viewer to see that the scene indicates a coincidence and even more to imagine that it has something to do with a greater purpose. Enlightenment scenes are visually poor and do not create the better feeling that it was supposed to. Do you recall the enlightenment with Keanu Reeves in Little Buddha ? Well this is nothing like that.Most scenes are poorly executed. There are a lot of scenes that really don't develop the story and also do not help in creating an atmosphere.The better actors in this movie namely Hector Elizondo Joaquim de Almeida and Jrgen Prochnow cannot save it. The first 2 seem to have gotten more scenes than their characters should in an attempt to save the movie and because they were paid more but this does not work. Most of the scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all.Jrgen does good in his scenes and sells as an evil guy as always but the script does not help him at all. The scene where he first tries to convince John Matthew Settle to join him is just bad script. The execution of the scene when he dies in an explosion is absurdly bad executed. The flashbacks throughout the movie cannot even be commented.Overall this movie is a big waste of time read the book!

	schema:headline " Yet another New Age hype movie based on ancient scrolls";
	schema:reviewBody "The film gives a rather condensed version of what is contained in the book which as far as I can tell by doing some research and investigative fact checking is largely a work of fiction. In reality there are no ancient scrolls and if the author was hard pressed I'm sure he'd have to admit he's never laid eyes on any scrolls in ancient Aramaic found in Peru. These valuable texts written as usual by anonymous were destroyed by the evil truth haters in the church and in the local government. That's rather strange as all kinds of New Age crap comes out each yearhundreds of books dozens of moviesand the Roman Catholic church doesn't seem to me to be hell bent on destroying the movement which it probably views as I do a total crock of doody. I'm no fan of the church mind you but at least the ancient texts which they base their faith on are real.It's a typical pattern of scam artists and religious hucksters to claim to have seen or translated ancient documents which unfortunately got destroyed by evil men or in Joseph Smith's case got taken back to Heaven once translated. Therefore the actual texts cannot be found in any museums like the Smithsonian nor the translations checked by specialists in ancient languages like Coptic or Aramaic. It's a scam. In one sense I admire anybody smart enough to come up with a great idea and make millions off it but I couldn't do it myself as I've no desire to mislead the public with more New Agey hokum.Occasionally a genuine ancient text does get found hidden away and lost for years. The Gospel of Judas a Gnostic text was discovered and after carbon dating and diligent study of the text deemed authentic by experts. The Gospel of Judas was referenced as heretical around 300 C.E.. No church documents from that time mention any Celestine Prophecies as authentic heretical or anything else.We are evolving towards somethingthat much is truebut the optimism in the Celestine Prophecy is based on nothing but fiction and lies and a philosophy built on a foundation of lies like a castle built on sand will collapse. The harsh ugly overpopulated cruel world of Blade Runner is more likely what it'll be like over the Horizon than some Utopian Hippie Commune where all is love and peace! I tell people the truth and they hate me but tell them what they want to hear even if pure piffle and one can make millions. The Celestine Prophecy is what the world wants to hear. Too bad it is a castle built on sand. Don't get me wrong. I wish to God the Celestine Vision was reality only it's not.

	onyx:emotionText "The film gives a rather condensed version of what is contained in the book which as far as I can tell by doing some research and investigative fact checking is largely a work of fiction. In reality there are no ancient scrolls and if the author was hard pressed I'm sure he'd have to admit he's never laid eyes on any scrolls in ancient Aramaic found in Peru. These valuable texts written as usual by anonymous were destroyed by the evil truth haters in the church and in the local government. That's rather strange as all kinds of New Age crap comes out each yearhundreds of books dozens of moviesand the Roman Catholic church doesn't seem to me to be hell bent on destroying the movement which it probably views as I do a total crock of doody. I'm no fan of the church mind you but at least the ancient texts which they base their faith on are real.It's a typical pattern of scam artists and religious hucksters to claim to have seen or translated ancient documents which unfortunately got destroyed by evil men or in Joseph Smith's case got taken back to Heaven once translated. Therefore the actual texts cannot be found in any museums like the Smithsonian nor the translations checked by specialists in ancient languages like Coptic or Aramaic. It's a scam. In one sense I admire anybody smart enough to come up with a great idea and make millions off it but I couldn't do it myself as I've no desire to mislead the public with more New Agey hokum.Occasionally a genuine ancient text does get found hidden away and lost for years. The Gospel of Judas a Gnostic text was discovered and after carbon dating and diligent study of the text deemed authentic by experts. The Gospel of Judas was referenced as heretical around 300 C.E.. No church documents from that time mention any Celestine Prophecies as authentic heretical or anything else.We are evolving towards somethingthat much is truebut the optimism in the Celestine Prophecy is based on nothing but fiction and lies and a philosophy built on a foundation of lies like a castle built on sand will collapse. The harsh ugly overpopulated cruel world of Blade Runner is more likely what it'll be like over the Horizon than some Utopian Hippie Commune where all is love and peace! I tell people the truth and they hate me but tell them what they want to hear even if pure piffle and one can make millions. The Celestine Prophecy is what the world wants to hear. Too bad it is a castle built on sand. Don't get me wrong. I wish to God the Celestine Vision was reality only it's not.

There is only one thief JeanClaude van Damme in the world which possesses the skills required to do this... But how can one convince him to come to Turkey and do the job?

The question asked in the film that is possible to measure the performance with one exam? As a main basis horse race was given in the movie.Ruya Onal is excellent we can see her movies in soon. JeanClaude Van Damme was not suit in his role. If he would played we should have seen much more action scenes. Other players were average. Some characters some typical pronunciation sticks to the player. We see Kadir Copdemir with same sort of character.The director tried to bring velocity to the movie by accelerating scenes. However for the velocity we need much more peculiarities.The movie is not bad on the whole at least it gives us valuable clues about life itself.".

The question asked in the film that is possible to measure the performance with one exam? As a main basis horse race was given in the movie.Ruya Onal is excellent we can see her movies in soon. JeanClaude Van Damme was not suit in his role. If he would played we should have seen much more action scenes. Other players were average. Some characters some typical pronunciation sticks to the player. We see Kadir Copdemir with same sort of character.The director tried to bring velocity to the movie by accelerating scenes. However for the velocity we need much more peculiarities.The movie is not bad on the whole at least it gives us valuable clues about life itself.";

In my opinion the acting performance of all the young actors are great and effective and also the musics chosen for the movie are making the movie more emotional and binds you with the characters of the movie more deeply.I guess the ones who will find a part from their life in this movie are the students. Also in the film we see not only the exam stress that the students are dealing with but also their relationships and mostly disagreements with their parents. In my opinion every parent should watch this movie as well in order to see how their negative attitude can have crucial effects on the child's psychology.Sinav is a movie worth seeing for. I'm sure that everyone will enjoy this synthesis of drama and comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cheating knows no bounds. It breaks through the Englishlanguage barrier with Omer Faruk Sorak's entry into the fray SINAV. The tale of five friends who conspire to beat the big exam the film opens with an intense nightmare montage and doesn't slow down from there. Even in the movie's most heartfelt moments there are few shots that last longer than five seconds. Otherwise the camera jumps around the image goes from color to black  white and back again and the film moves with at a pace that could trigger epileptic seizures. Despite this wild montage at close to two hours SINAV becomes a rather tiresome venture.Too much of the film is a buildup to any kind of educational larceny. The moral chasm of cheating appears to be more of a crack in the sidewalk to these youths who defiantly charge that they'll steal questions from the ones who steal my youth. It doesn't help that the school has brought in a motivational speaker who now makes money selling exam tutorial classes but is best known for being Armless Levo a student who used an arm cast to sneak study sheets into examinations. And this successful businessman is their role model? The emotional center of the film is Mert Ismail Hacioglu a troubled teen who seems to have left school to get a job but has no trouble returning when he wants to fulfill his dying mother's dream of getting a proper education. While Mert deals with his mother's cancer and his inability to study his compatriots all have their own home problems to face from the everbickering parents of Gazme Rya nal to the parents who want to get their son Sinan Yagmur Atacan an exorcism since he doesn't test well.SINAV plays like a Turkish version of THE PERFECT SCORE until it jettisons all heretofore structure of the film's own logic at the ninetyminute mark. Rather than performing some smaller heists for test keys and being general nuisances to the totalitarian teachers and principal the kids decide to call in a world class thief Charlie who one of their own Uluc Volkan Demirok met as a child. Only having the name Uluk actually manages to find this thief after sending out 17000 emails. When he arrives everyone can't help but notice how much Charlie JeanClaude Van Damme looks like JeanClaude Van Damme.In another braincrushing twist it turns out that JeanClaude Van Damme is friends with Armless Levo and the two of them have cooked up a scheme to give the kids the wrong exam in order to teach them a valuable moral lesson. Ouch! Had the film stuck with the reality of the situation and kept up the potboiler pressure of parents professors and peers SINAV may have worked. As it was the Van Damme es Machina became a fatal flaw from which the film could not recover.".

Basic plot Ali Baba Rod Flash aka Iloosh Khoshabe aka Richard Lloyd has hidden the sacred crown in the opensesame cave the bad guys who want it capture Ali and repeatedly torture him and his companions including the obligatory dwarf the villain's daughter falls in love with Ali and helps him escape there is a big battle at the end.The film brims with zest. Ali Baba is a joyous and lustful fellow often seen getting out of the bed of a satisfiedlooking woman. The various tortures and tests to which he is subjected are among the most devilishly complicated and sadistic ever seen in a peplum. And Ali's lovehate affair with the villain's daughter is HOT.Of the peplums Khosabe made this is by far his best showcase. He bares his chest early in the film and stays halfnaked throughout his torments and tests as well as his eventual triumph with lots of closeups of his straining back brawny chest and strikingly handsome face. When he is dressed in a revealing Arabian Nights outfit the designers show off his physique splendidly.I hope one day to see this movie in a widescreen color format is there an archive print somewhere in Europe? so as to enjoy it in its full glory.".

The film consists of people fighting talking getting captured escaping fighting round and round in an endless circle with little in the way of originality to distinguish it from the other Italian productions of the period. I still find it hard to understand why the Italians decided to make Ali Baba films without any magical elements or exoticism aside from that old clich of the Open Sesame! hidden door  surely the exotic locales and characters should be exploited to their full extent rather than going through the motions in what if you changed the settings and costumes would be another runofthemill peplum yarn.All in all it's a pretty violent film with lots of people dying violent tortured deaths. Unfortunately the action scenes are few and far between and invariably disappoint in their sheer shoddiness with guys hitting each other with lumps of wood with no skill. Sometimes somebody hits someone else with a sword but there's no blood. The only time this film gets kindof exciting is in the bloodandthunder finale. The best thing this production has to offer are some colourful costumes and a far eastern theme tune which is repeated over and over throughout. Rod Flash VULCAN SON OF JUPITER is the musclebound meathead of a hero who wanders through the plot Bella Cortez GIANT OF METROPOLIS the most watchable plot element as the voluptuous love interest who wanders around in lowcut clothes. The bad guy as played by Furio Meniconi isn't nearly evil enough for this kind of production.Also thrown into the cooking pot of the plot are a friendly dwarf tribal dances a wicked witch who consults her crystal ball a huge spiked pendulum torture device which knocks people into burning pits a gang of guys in jokeshop fright masks Ali Baba's hilarious screams of agony when he gets wounded the same bloody wound being burnt closed with a knife and some mystical mumbo jumbo but no special effects  the budget wouldn't stretch that far. There's always something going on in the film but the problem is that it just isn't very interesting. Three years later director Emimmo Salvi returned with ALI BABA AND THE 7 SARACENS an unconnected sequel which saw Rod Flash apparently without his muscles Bella Cortez and the dwarf actor returning in a greatly improved and more entertaining production  thanks in part to Gordon Mitchell's totally overthetop portrayal of the manic bad guy.

Think of lots of 1950's low budget scifi cliches bad acting bad special effects etc. and then throw them all into a single movie.  The outcome of this is a critic's nightmare 1958's Earth vs. the Spider.  There's no way such trash with all its errors can be entertaining right? Wrong.The only real disappointing goof in this film is the title a horrid misnomer as the spider only gets to crawl about its web in a cave and a small town and less than 10 people in the town actually fight it.  Of those 10 people most are represented by the driest actors imaginable except for the women who get to scream and sob and the teenagers are obviously not especially Joe who looks like he's in his mid30's.  Said teenagers also make decisions in the film that are stupid yet at the same time have enough logic that the audience is able to forgive them for it as opposed to some movies of the genre where people just act stupid out of the blue.  It might seem like a really bad idea to go to a killer giant spider's cave but if it is to retrieve the last memento of one's father its understandable although still not a wise choice.  The teen characters in this film act like that making them less annoying and more lovable than most teen victims in the genre.The spider they take on is unimaginatively a runofthemill tarantula filmed and superimposed over scenes to make it seem gigantic sometimes it's really noticeable and looks awful but most of the time it works yet still comes off as tacky since the spider is always moving in the same direction.  Besides that fact the other main reason that this barely works is that the spider and the people are rarely in the same shot at the same time.  This also means that all deaths are offcamera but accompanied by the spider's unspiderlike hissing and growling and the resulting corpses are really weirdlooking by no means realistic but odd enough to be entertaining.Which is really the reason why films like these are watchable and to some like me even enjoyable.  Sure there won't be any Oscar nominations for the acting but isn't it funny to hear a science teacher call a spider an insect? He should obviously know better.  Isn't it funny that the route the lead teens take to escape from the spider at the beginning of the film leads to a deadend at the end of it? That was obviously a mistake in the script writing.  Granted these mistakes aren't intentional or intelligent humor but it's humor nonetheless and there's enough of it to recommend this film to fans of the genre.  It's also worth noting that this film thankfully knows its limits and is thus quite short so that it can be enjoyable without dragging on and on.".

	schema:reviewBody "I guess Bert needed a catchier title than just The Spider which was what this was originally titled. Following in the wakes of TARANTULA Bert I. Gordon bestows upon us this um epic of medium proportions. The story deals with two teens in a small midwestern town one of whom works at a theater which so blatantly displays a poster of Gordon's AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN go looking for the girl's father who was killed it turns out by a web belonging to the titular beast which coincidentally is never explained how it grew so big or survived for so long even if Ed Kemmer from SPACE PATROL tries to explain. But egghead Ed manages to kill the spider and bring it back to the school gym where it is locked up. But wouldn't you know it  the evils of rock and roll bring it to life and it kills Mr. Ziffel from GREEN ACRES. How can they kill it? Electricity anyone?Lord you have to admire a man like Bert who directed produced wrote and created the special effects. Sure the effects suck but think about it. He saved money and became an auteur at the same time! And while we're on the effects . . . let's just say Plan 9 has some serious competition as it deals with the spider attacking photos of buildings or walking along as a rear projection which the audience can clearly see through. And please the spider could fit in the gym how could it tower over a three story building? But an added advantage this has is that the spider in this one has a web even if no one sticks to it. And truth be told it's actually quite entertaining in a perverse sort of way. At least it doesn't have the long dull stretches that most Gordon films do. Thank you Mr. Gordon.".

The story deals with two teens in a small midwestern town one of whom works at a theater which so blatantly displays a poster of Gordon's AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN go looking for the girl's father who was killed it turns out by a web belonging to the titular beast which coincidentally is never explained how it grew so big or survived for so long even if Ed Kemmer from SPACE PATROL tries to explain. But egghead Ed manages to kill the spider and bring it back to the school gym where it is locked up. But wouldn't you know it  the evils of rock and roll bring it to life and it kills Mr. Ziffel from GREEN ACRES. How can they kill it? Electricity anyone?Lord you have to admire a man like Bert who directed produced wrote and created the special effects. Sure the effects suck but think about it. He saved money and became an auteur at the same time! And while we're on the effects . . . let's just say Plan 9 has some serious competition as it deals with the spider attacking photos of buildings or walking along as a rear projection which the audience can clearly see through. And please the spider could fit in the gym how could it tower over a three story building? But an added advantage this has is that the spider in this one has a web even if no one sticks to it. And truth be told it's actually quite entertaining in a perverse sort of way. At least it doesn't have the long dull stretches that most Gordon films do. Thank you Mr. Gordon.";

The spider's growl is a bit much.  I don't know if arachnids make any audible noises but this one is very vocal.The cave sets are pretty impressive interlaced with real shots of Carlsbad Caverns. The story is fairly plausible and Gene Roth is a trip as the town sheriff.Albert Glasser gives us again a terrific score that adds to the terror of the story.  For it's theatrical release the original title was shortened to just The Spider.  That would fit easily on any marquee.".

THE SPIDER are thin beer indeed but adequate.  These effects include rear projection split screens superimposures miniatures and forced perspective utilizing photographic plates of famed Carlsbad Caverns.

While firmly ensconced in genre conventions the film's tongue in cheek tone promotes such a wholesome sense of enjoyment that such clichs feel warmly familiar rather than suffocatingly so. Like many of its contemporaries the film explores notions of adults versus teenagers one particularly comical yet chilling scene has the titular creature awoken by a rock 'n roll song and dance interlude and science versus good old fashioned American values though the film is politically correct to not outright condemn scientists as nonsensical lunatics as many other such films do. Similarly the much alluded to cause for the spider's abnormal growth is crucially never discovered feeding into cultural notions of postwar nuclear paranoia. However the film boasts surprisingly strong production values the spider's cave is a wonderfully grotesque setting and above par special effects given its inevitably low budget and again manages to bend convention to its advantage through use of an eerie theremin score giving it a sturdy enough veneer to make for a surprisingly entertaining 73 minutes. Despite the cast's typically universally flat performances failing to infuse much life into the shoddy script one would hardly peruse such fare for the acting making the cast's lackluster efforts endearingly amusing. Ed Kemmer interestingly melds the 'scientist voice of reason' and 'charismatic protagonist' figures into a single character and feels all the more fresh and appealing because of it. June Kenney is often embarrassingly and comically melodramatic as a teen mourning her missing father and Eugene Persson counterbalances her overacting with a dull unenthusiastic performance as her earnest gee whiz boyfriend. Gene Roth delivers many an intentionally comical moment as the town's ineffective sheriff who also intriguingly shifts roles into a voice of reason figure later on.Despite a slew of expected faults given its genre Earth vs. the Spider is never less than supremely entertaining making for a wonderful comedy intentionally or not and easily worth investigating for any fans of classic horror or those willing to derive amusement from envisioning how frightening it must have been to 1958 audiences or simply ridiculing it throughout. 510".

It has a very formal three act structure.In Act One a man driving home crashes his pickup truck when he hits something stretched across the highway. Carol his daughter and Mike her boyfriend borrow a car from their friend Joe thirtyfive years old and still a student in high school! and go in search of him. They find the wrecked vehicle and go into a cave convincingly portrayed by the very brightly lighted a fact no one mentions Carlsbad Caverns where they find a giant spider from which they barely escape.

I listened with headphones because the family was asleep and I'd swear that the spider mutters home....home as he heads toward the cave.The somewhat overlong third act finds Carol and Mike in the cave searching for a bracelet which her late father had purchased for her. She had dropped it running for safety in the first act and wants to retrieve it. They are unaware that the spider is alive until it returns. The authorities seal the cave with dynamite figuring that they've entombed the spider for good. When they find out the teenagers are in there they have to start digging. The spider chases Carol and Mike onto a ledge. The science teacher and sheriff find them and they rig equipment to electrocute the spider. Happy endings. Well not for the spider or the people who were spider snacks but still a happy ending.This is just flat a fun movie. The people making it knew it wasn't CITIZEN KANE. They did their jobs and went home. The special effects are surprisingly good when you consider the time and the tiny budget that Bert I. Gordon had. There are some elements that are surprisingly effective. The sound quality is impressive. Scenes where people are talking in the hallway of the school have the slight echo quality you get in hallways of such structures. The music is rousing and effective. And American Movie Classics got a print that's in pristine condition clear and sharp black and white.Looking up the cast members through IMDb is fun. Gene Persson who plays Mike went on to produce YOU'RE A GOOD MAN CHARLIE BROWN on Broadway. Many cast and crew had long and varied careers some going on to much bigger things.Enjoy.Some people take argument with the title EARTH VS. THE SPIDER. It wasn't the spiders goal to stop with one small town. And that town was as best we can tell on planet Earth.I rest my case.".

It has a very formal three act structure.In Act One a man driving home crashes his pickup truck when he hits something stretched across the highway. Carol his daughter and Mike her boyfriend borrow a car from their friend Joe thirtyfive years old and still a student in high school! and go in search of him. They find the wrecked vehicle and go into a cave convincingly portrayed by the very brightly lighted a fact no one mentions Carlsbad Caverns where they find a giant spider from which they barely escape.

If we had see these movies when they came out originally in the theaters or drive ins we probably would have been scared out of our wits.Now this movie Earth vs the Spider a true creature feature stuck in my mind over many of the other ones. The scene that I remembered for years afterwards and hoped like crazy that they would show the movie again was the scene when the band starts playing that real hot music in the gym with the spider listening in. I just couldn't believe how anyone would want to be in the same room as the spider.I was so happy when they showed the movie I guess maybe a half a year later. I was ready. I set up my tape recorder and waited patiently for that particular scene and when I got that music on tape I got REALLY excited!!!!!!That was the only thing that I had from that movie until about 3 months ago. I found a video store that had the movie!!!!! I couldn't wait to bring it home and play it in order to find out what was the rest of the movie all about.Yes I did remember all about the spider itself and how it reeked havoc in a small town in the middle of nowhere. I remembered about the useless sheriff Gene Roth and his attitude towards the townsfolk and the kids funny he plays a lot of those kind of parts. Plus I remembered the fellow who played Mr. Kingman the hero. He used to play Commander Corry in Space Patrol which was on television in the very early 50s.The scene with the band in the gym with the spider and the drama class still was very powerful. I just couldn't get over how funny it was.To me that made the whole movie a joy to watch!!!!For Saturday afternoon fun where you don't have to think rent this one!!! You won't be disappointed!!!!".

Please folks  never bring a kid to a Harvey Keitel movie.Anyway this movie is pretty good for its genre  way better than the one with Shatner from the 70's where they dress up VW's in fake fur.

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this on AMC's Monsterfest in High School in the early 2000's I had my tape ready  all it was on very late 3 or 4 in the Morning. It's about a 50foot giant spider mutated by radiation one of Mankind's mistakes for fooling with atomic stuff that usually was the Precursor to most of the 50's SciFi Films about big bugs or everyday Small creatures mutated into giants. Here Gordon seems to have done a SpinOff of Jack Arnold's Tarantula on a smaller budget for A.I.P. Which Tarantula is better in many ways not just effects wise similar Effects used in that too. Well a young teenage girl Carol played by June Kenney also in another Bert I. Gordon SciFi Classic Attack Of The Puppet People from '58 discovers her dad is missing for he never Returns from getting her bday gift the night before. Her  her Boyfriend Mike takes their friend Joe's Car to go look for him. They Find a large long skinny piece of silk stretched across a road along With broken glass from a windshield they find her dad's truck in a Ditch on the side of the road  find also a cave that her dad might Have gone in for shelter so they investigate they eventually fall in a Huge spider's web that looks like rope very unrealistic looking Especially since it's a real Tarantula used in the film  Tarantula's Don't make webs  walk on them or creep down on them. Gordon should of Used a different spider but considering the effects  the time period he used the biggest spider which is a Tarantula or The South American Bird Spider which with its legs stretched out it's as big as a Dinner Plate. It would of been a lot harder  impossible with a smaller spider such as a common House spider which is what the Tarantula is supposed to represent. It would of been harder to enlarge on film  use with models. Mike  Carol fall into this web  hear sounds loud screeching high pitched vocal cords from something incredibly huge it's coming this way it's a large hairy Spider they are frightened to death  run out of the cave as quickly as possible they take part of the web from the road back with them but no one Is convinced not even the local sheriff. Pretty quickly The Sheriff  other officers headed by a high school teacher played by Ed Kemmer try some DDT  they do knock it Conscious. They put it on display in the high school gym for the time being until it is going be moved to a nearby university. Joe  his friends practice for the upcoming high school dance in the same gym Where the giant spider is on display. Joe  his buds are playing Instruments  young teens dancing which the vibrations cause the spider to be awakened which makes sense most spiders rely heavily on vibrations. Which being awakened sends it through the high school gym wall  on a Rampage through the small town of Riverfalls It heads back to the cave eventually  they get it in the cave when they attach a live power line to it's web  electrocute it. Then it's dynamited  buried. I really enjoyed it this was one of the best giant spider films  believe me there are many big spider films. Superb eerie musical score by Albert Glasser who also did Gordon's Beginning Of The End 1957 where Giant Locusts or Grasshopper Locusts run amok in Chicago. Glasser also did Monster From Green Hell 1958 with Giant Wasps in Africa  a few more I believe. My quick run down of this story for this isn't the exact whole story check it out BMovie fans if you haven't seen it already. I thought I would also mention that the original title was The Spider suddenly last minute was changed  Earth vs. was added. On the credits u can tell too with The Spider in huge lettering  Earth vs. in small Lettering. Also a lot of Original Posters are still around that say The Spider.".

	onyx:emotionText "I first saw this on AMC's Monsterfest in High School in the early 2000's I had my tape ready  all it was on very late 3 or 4 in the Morning. It's about a 50foot giant spider mutated by radiation one of Mankind's mistakes for fooling with atomic stuff that usually was the Precursor to most of the 50's SciFi Films about big bugs or everyday Small creatures mutated into giants. Here Gordon seems to have done a SpinOff of Jack Arnold's Tarantula on a smaller budget for A.I.P. Which Tarantula is better in many ways not just effects wise similar Effects used in that too. Well a young teenage girl Carol played by June Kenney also in another Bert I. Gordon SciFi Classic Attack Of The Puppet People from '58 discovers her dad is missing for he never Returns from getting her bday gift the night before. Her  her Boyfriend Mike takes their friend Joe's Car to go look for him. They Find a large long skinny piece of silk stretched across a road along With broken glass from a windshield they find her dad's truck in a Ditch on the side of the road  find also a cave that her dad might Have gone in for shelter so they investigate they eventually fall in a Huge spider's web that looks like rope very unrealistic looking Especially since it's a real Tarantula used in the film  Tarantula's Don't make webs  walk on them or creep down on them. Gordon should of Used a different spider but considering the effects  the time period he used the biggest spider which is a Tarantula or The South American Bird Spider which with its legs stretched out it's as big as a Dinner Plate. It would of been a lot harder  impossible with a smaller spider such as a common House spider which is what the Tarantula is supposed to represent. It would of been harder to enlarge on film  use with models. Mike  Carol fall into this web  hear sounds loud screeching high pitched vocal cords from something incredibly huge it's coming this way it's a large hairy Spider they are frightened to death  run out of the cave as quickly as possible they take part of the web from the road back with them but no one Is convinced not even the local sheriff. Pretty quickly The Sheriff  other officers headed by a high school teacher played by Ed Kemmer try some DDT  they do knock it Conscious. They put it on display in the high school gym for the time being until it is going be moved to a nearby university. Joe  his friends practice for the upcoming high school dance in the same gym Where the giant spider is on display. Joe  his buds are playing Instruments  young teens dancing which the vibrations cause the spider to be awakened which makes sense most spiders rely heavily on vibrations. Which being awakened sends it through the high school gym wall  on a Rampage through the small town of Riverfalls It heads back to the cave eventually  they get it in the cave when they attach a live power line to it's web  electrocute it. Then it's dynamited  buried. I really enjoyed it this was one of the best giant spider films  believe me there are many big spider films.

THE FLYING SAUCERS 1956! All of which suggests this was a pure exploitation flick aimed at teenagers even incorporating a rock'n'roll number at one point and on that level it is not too bad  being also thankfully brief at just 73 minutes  though clearly offering nothing we have not seen before! The Carlsbad caves used for a good part of the duration supply an ideal otherworldly backdrop even if the special effects involving the spider itself are less successful the spider often changes color from dark black to light grey! the wizened makeup created for the blooddrained victims is rather creepy however. One thing which can be said about Bert I. Gordon is that he was a shrewd promoter and to be sure two of his other horrorscifi efforts get namechecked here namely THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN 1957 and ATTACK OF THE PUPPET PEOPLE 1958  both of which as it happens I have acquired in time to be viewed this Halloween along with three more of the director's work within the genre".

The movie doesn't have any Hammer's big stars in the cast the story doesn't bring anything new into the mummy myth and at few times the going gets unintentionally hilarious in the film. But on the other hand the characters are acted quite solidly even if the performances don't truly shine. Comical reliefs are mostly done with certain style especially by Fred Clark as a P.T. Barnum replica and the plot has few interesting twists. We even have here few scenes of surprisingly graphic of it's time if a bit unrealistic screen violence if that's your cup of tea. Slow pace and low action rate of the film works more for than against the movie at least in my books and the whole package is short enough so the story can carry it all through till the end.All in all if you're a fan of old horror films give it a go whether you're a fan of Hammer studios works or not. At least this one certainly beats the stuffing out of it's followup Mummy's shroud which in my opinion truly deserves any public stoning it gets.This is my truth  what is yours?".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very slow film with a not very frightening monster a rather dull romance and some pretty unconvincing backgrounds.That said it does have its moments of excitement and the basic story manages to hold one's interest if you can get through the long stretches of expository dialogue.The parts that stay in my memory the strongest are those involving the tragic figure of archaeologist Giles Dalrymple played by Jack Gwillim.This dignified older man has a weakness for alcohol and as his embarrassment at being an unwilling participant in the hokey show biz presentation of the mummy by the American impresario increases his drinking gets worse. There are a couple of truly memorable and sad scenes involving his boozing one where a housekeeper tries to persuade her employer to eat supper as he pours himself the latest of many drinks and insists he isn't hungry.The other is an uncomfortably convincing scene of Giles trying to be helpful to a younger colleague who is translating a manuscript and Giles clumsily spills his drink on the ancient parchment. The younger archaeologist has been trying to restrain his impatience and discomfort with the awkwardness of his mentor being intoxicated but he loses his temper and curses Giles for being a drunken old fool. The actor's look of chagrin at what he has just said is completely real as is Giles' sad low key response as he looks shocked at first but says  So I see I've lost your respect now also and the younger man tries to pretend he didn't mean it.This scene is perhaps the most memorable of the entire film and quite moving. It's a small moment in the convoluted tale of the mummy and the curse but a striking one nonetheless.Having recently acquired a copy of this movie and seen it twice I am struck by the idea that the basic storyline is rather intriguing and might have made for a much more exciting picture. I think the main problem is that the leads are not terribly interesting personalities andor that their characters are underwritten. Imagine the possibilities if Christopher Lee had played the part of Adam Beauchamp instead of Terence Morgan or Richard Pasco had played John. Terence Morgan gives his role a good try but I can't help feeling that Lee would have brought a really intense evil charisma to the part of Adam that would have made Annette's attraction to him more believable. Also imagine the level of intensity and fire that Pasco would have brought to the role of John with serious conflict between him and Adam over the love of Annette.I think this is not really a bad film at all but it could have been better with more inspired casting.".

	schema:reviewBody "On an Egyptian expedition a group of British explorers stumble across the hidden tomb of the pharaoh Ra yes I know quite original. But once they bring him back to England for exhibition they find the tomb to be empty. Did someone steal this priceless specimen or is the curse real with a lumbering corpse walking the streets of London ready to kill those who disturbed his rest? Has a good mummy film been made in thirty years? I can't think of a recent one The Mummy with Brendan Fraser really isn't all that great. The 90s were not mummyfriendly. The 80s? Not so much. Vampires zombies... no problem. Even werewolves get the occasional bone tossed to them Dog Soldiers. Where are the mummies? I don't know. But I do know you can find one seriously cool mummy in this film.The actual mummy doesn't appear until the third act with about twenty minutes left. We are instead treated to the conflicts deceptions and internal politics of these competing archaeologists. And believe it or not this works. A good plot is unraveled with interesting characters... Hammer Studios didn't use the usual cast sorry Lee and Cushing but gave us others that are equally capable. A romance blossoms that pays off later on in the film.Mummy films are interesting or at least this one is if thought of as a moral tale about invading and desecrating a foreign culture. Sure we can talk of a curse that kills those who disturb a mummy's rest. But how often do Egyptians dig up their own kings? It's more often... the Brits. So there's something of a moral suggesting the Brits a dominant empire shouldn't be meddling in the affairs of weaker nations stealing their heritage for monetary gain. Would the Brits want Egyptians digging up William the Conqueror? Then again maybe they would. Things take a bizarre turn later on that you'll have to see to believe. One of the archaeologists is not who he says he is. And yes you really ought to see this film. I watched it courtesy of the Icons of Horror box set featuring four classic Hammer films and I can now say that all four are worth watching and even owning. Hammer knew horror and some of their gems at the time make today's horror look silly in comparison. Until a better mummy film comes along and I've been waiting decades this is the one to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb is out of Hammer Film Productions and written and directed by Michael Carreras. It stars Terence Morgan Ronald Howard Fred Clark  Jeanne Roland. Music is by Carlo Martelli and cinematography Otto Heller. It's shot in Technicolor using the Techniscope format. Plot sees three British Egyptologists discover the tomb of Prince Ra and under guidance from their showman benefactor bring their discovery back to London. Once in London the Mummified body of Ra starts killing people it seems someone has the knowhow to resurrect the creature for evil doings.It doesn't actually feel like a Hammer Horror movie except for Roland's cleavage that is. The cast are largely unfamiliar Hammer performers and you sense that the casting is a deliberate attempt to detract from a very salient point. As a story and how it's strung together The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb is pretty much an uncredited remake of Hammer's own excellent first foray into Mummy world in 1959. Once mooted as that film's sequel it has since been distanced as such because of the similarities. Which means to judge it as a standalone or a remake which makes it a lazy cash in then is the question. Fact is tho is that either way it's a distinctly average film from a narrative view point. The acting is fine enough tho Roland really is only there for said cleavage and the sets and vibrant colour make it very pleasing to the eye. But it takes an age to get going and the unoriginality of the script only hastens the feeling of well boredom setting in.Wrapping up bad pun I know it's watchable and better looking than the other Mummy film's that Hammer released after it. But really it all feels lazy and pales in comparison to the first film in 1959. 510".

	schema:headline " This is a Hammer film...?";
	schema:reviewBody "The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb is Hammer's second foray into ancient Egypt...and it's not as good as the first. Not even nearly. None of the cast from 'The Mummy' has returned probably because they read the script and the film lacks both the ingenuity and goodnatured style that has come to be associated with Hammer productions. In fact this film goes directly against what Hammer fans have come to love about their films as about two thirds of it is frankly boring! The film is far too talky and it diffuses any sense of dread or horror that the film contains. To be honest I have no idea why Hammer studios ever greenlighted it. The story is basically a rerun of the first film except there's far more chat about the pitfalls of taking ancient relics away from a Mummy's tomb as opposed to the far more interesting subject of Egyptian mythology. We follow an American that is very much like J. Jameson from the Spiderman films who decides to make a sideshow out of a mummy and ends up feeling the Mummy's curse after a whole load of boring nonsense.When the film does finally get going it isn't bad as we've got a mummy going round bumping people off left right and centre but it takes far too long to get to this stage and by the time it does you couldn't care less about the mummy the characters or anything else about the film. Many people seem to be giving the film small plaudits for the mummy's makeup but I honestly can't see why. It looks like something some kid made in a Paper Mache class assuming kids have Paper Mache classes of course and nothing like what you'd expect to find in a horror movie. The Mummy suffers because it's boring lacks invention and doesn't feature enough horror. This is by far the worst Hammer film I've seen and if you really have to see it I recommend fastforwarding the first hour and just watching the ending. Feel free to disregard my sage advice but I don't doubt that you'll wish you'd heeded it when the credits finally role.".

Carreras also wrote this under the pseudonym Henry Younger.'The Curse' has not found a huge amount of favour from fans over the years but I really like it.

Fred Clarke renowned American comic actor plays the larger than life Alexander King who it seems invented the term Turkish Delight in this film arrogantly determined to milk as much money from the Mummy as possible but lives or dies to regret it. Jack Gwillim is very good as pickled deflated Sir Giles Dalrymple whose demise is the film's highpoint in my view whilst underrated actor Terence Morgan excels as villainous and debonair Adam Beauchamp who is more interesting than stuffy square jawed hero John Bray Ronald Howard.The Mummy Dickie Owen is a curio. He seems slight compared with the usual culprits and has a claylike face giving him a Golemlike aspect. But he is directed very well and his kills are often accompanied by nothing but the sound of his deep rhythmical breathing which makes up for his less than intimidating bearing.It is true to say that the story takes a while to get going but is a solid telling of typical Mummy revenge and certainly livens up once the resurrected RaAntef begins his killing spree and remains compelling until the exciting sewerbased finale in which Beauchamp is also relieved of his hand.".

Writerdirector Michael Carreras alas allows the opening half to plod by at a leisurely clip and crucially fails to build any tension or momentum that would sped things along better. It doesn't help that the story is totally routine Once again a lethal shambling mummy springs to angry life in order to avenge itself on several people who are foolish enough to desecrate its tomb. Fortunately the movie finally begins humming and delivers a few effectively rousing mounts after the mummy awakens. Dickie Owen as the mummy makes for an impressively fierce and fearsome monster. The violence is shockingly brutal and gruesome stuff. Plus there's a nice unexpected plot twist involving one of the central characters. The game cast do their best with the mediocre material with especially standout contributions by Terence Morgan as the charming Adam Beauchamp Ronald Howard as the huffy John Bray Fred Clark as the blithely crass P.T. Barnumesque American showman Alexander King Jeanne Roland as the fetching sensitive Annette Dubois George Pastell as the helpful Hashmi Bey and Jack Gwillim as the hearty morally upright Sir Giles Dalrymple. Both Otto Heller's sumptuous widescreen cinematography and Carlo Martelli's robust stirring score are up to par. But overall this film is way too bland and meandering to be anything more than a merely watchable and acceptable timewaster.".

Certainly not the better mummy film of the seriesI thought Holt's Blood from the Mummy's Tomb was quite better and more interestingand doesn't really take an original route showcasing some very familiar materialsuch as the idea of invading crypts and removing mummy's from their rightful burial ground or the exploitation of ancient civilizations for profit taking a nice little jab to ribs of American materialism.

Despite the extraordinarily slow pacing the first hour of the film does nothing except to set up the various characters and their relationships the production values  even in a film relatively cheap by Hammer standards  are top drawer the costumes and sets are fun love those Egyptian backlots and there's even a smattering of graphic gore for those who enjoy that kind of thing. Imagine the year this film was made. Now watch the film complete with multiple handchoppings bludgeoning beating and  most graphic of all  an offscreen but horrific thanks to the sound effects guy headcrushing underfoot  and you can imagine that the film must have been considered pretty terrible when it was first released. Sure today it seems tame but I still get a kick out of gruesomeness that is readily achieved WITHOUT excessive bloodshed and through imagination more than anything else.The storyline is very predictable and doesn't need retelling here other than it contains the usual themes of cursed siblings one good one evil the mummy falling in love with a beautiful girl immortality and the bumping off of those who first defiled the Egyptian tomb. The leading characters all seem pretty stuffy but the actors do manage to put in more than adequate performances aside from Jeanne Roland who's pretty but hopelessly miscast. Terence Morgan is devilishly evil as the slick bad guy Ronald Howard more than acceptable as the decent hero Fred Clark steals the show as a P.T. Barnumstyle sideshow hustler who wants to get the mummy working for HIM. Then there's a trio of great supporting performances from George Pastell Michael Ripper killed all too early and Jack Gwillim.The mummy makeup is imposing but not necessarily all that scary and an interesting touch has the mummy heavy breathing as he goes about his business kind of like a prototype Darth Vader! After the slow first hour things pick up for the climax throwing in some genuinely nasty shocks one death scene is one of the juiciest in the whole Hammer repertoire and a climax that must have seemed good on paper but doesn't work all so well. Would sewers really collapse that easily? Still despite the ambiguity of the climax this is a fun enough ride for genre fans content to happily sit through welldone ripe dialogue and costume drama to get to the good gruesomeness.".

	schema:reviewBody "A shame because a lot of Hammer's films are great or at least very entertaining. But unlike 1959's The Mummy directed by Terrence Fisher and starring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb is not one of their finest hours. Not unwatchable by all means but very much a lesser effort for them.The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb is a goodlooking film at least thankfully not having the rushed and madeonthequickandcheap production values of the Universal Kharis Mummy films. The chilling Hammer atmosphere is present in how the film looks with the sumptuous Gothic sets lush photography that does a fine job evoking some atmosphere much tighter editing and rich bold colours. The music score is hauntingly stirring and while The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb is too often dull it really does pick up in the final twenty minutes. The final twenty minutes make the film with the film being at its most horrifying and suspenseful by some considerable distance with some gruesome but not overlygratuitous shocksi.e. the amputation scene and a tense and exciting sewer chase.Regarding the acting the supporting cast fare far better than the leads. George Pastell brings a lot of charisma to his role Jack Gwillum is movingly sympathetic and in particular Fred Clark plays a very sleazy character with intensity and lively and often funny comic timing. The very muchforgotten Dickie Owen while just lacking the imposing creepiness of Christopher Lee and the pathos of Boris Karloffmuch better than Lon Chaney Jnr though at least Owen's heart seemed in it is still a very formidable Mummy and is aided by some cool makeup. One just wishes he was on screen for longer and was introduced earlier.On the other hand the pacing really hurts The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb. It starts off well but for at least three quarters of an hourmost of the film the film is very tediously paced and painfully predictable with the less eventful scenes dragging interminably and even with a few surprise twists here and there everything just felt very overfamiliar. There is very little tension thrills or sense of dread or horror further let down by a pointless and saccharinely written love triangle that takes up far too much of the film. It also feels far too talky and stilted with the romantic parts being truly banal the humour while sometimes amusing and wellplayed at other points overdone unneeded or not the best placed and the speeches sideshows and history lessons didn't properly maintain interest.While the supporting cast acquit themselves well the three leads aren't too great. Ronald Howard is the least bad but he has given far more involved performances he has presence but at other points he sleepwalks through his role. Terrence Morgan is a wooden bore though that his character is very underwritten doesn't help in but Jeanne Roland fares the worst. Despite her exotic looks Roland spends the entire time looking lost and is not always easy to understand at worst incomprehensible. Michael Carreras has his moments he shines in the last act with some of his visual directing and storytelling being almost worthy of the best of Hammer but most of it sadly is very routine competent and technically accomplished but he forgets to make the story and characters interesting so fails to engage the viewer as a result.All in all despite it coming to life in the last twenty minutes amongst a few other things The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb is one of the lesser and duller Hammer films. 510 Bethany Cox".

The costumes are beautiful the sets are extravagant the exterior landscapes are a lush paradise the monsters are huge puppets and just when you think the story can't become more bizarre...it does! An absurdly majestic music score by Les Baxter strives to match the melodrama of a hero who dares to revolt against the gods themselves.Cottafavi will try just about anything to dazzle and disorient the viewer. In one scene as our hero approaches looms above and then passes over the camera the point of view turns completely upsidedown the effect is so audacious I had to laugh out loud!

Although I got the price of admission back 15 cents I never did get to finish the film. Due to the fact I was very young I was most impressed with the parts of the movie I did get to see. It is years later and I finally got to see the entire movie completely. I am surprised to sit through the entire film without yawning. The scenes which intrigued and captivated me as a child were laughable as an adult. However I am impressed with the story of how Goliath or Hercules was able to mesmerize young impressible audiences with such a small budget and hokey special effects. Still as a grownup I would quickly recommend this film to young members of the audience as they have not lost their imagination or have forgotten what it means to be inspired by flickering images. During the Sword and Sandal era these movies are the very inspiration we received when it was needed most. How else could Gods Goddesses Monsters Centars and heroic deeds have impressed us so much?

Watch him bark orders to soldiers like he were plotting a gangland rubout.  Meanwhile Mark Forest is the hero called Emilius who is nicknamed Goliath because he is so strong and apparently immortal.  He also has a younger brother is is neither superstrong nor immortal and a mortal wife who is not bothered by the fact that she will eventually grow old and die but he won't.  Go figure. Most of us watch these movies for the monsters and ofttimes the cheesier the better.  After a mechanical 3 headed fire breathing dog ahem that is NOT Cerberus! a man in suit giant bat and a centaur which had to have been the most uncomfortable costume in the bunch seeing a dragon that is partially stop motion animated was a real treat.  Oh yeah in closeups it is a giant rubber prop but those few moments of animation make it worthwhile. There is enough plot here for 2 movies and it does not always make perfect sense but the action will keep your attention.  Oh and look closely at that dragon.  David Hewitt borrowed some of the stopmotion scenes for his no budget thriller THE MIGHTY GORGA.".

Most of us watch these movies for the monsters and ofttimes the cheesier the better.  After a mechanical 3 headed fire breathing dog ahem that is NOT Cerberus! a man in suit giant bat and a centaur which had to have been the most uncomfortable costume in the bunch seeing a dragon that is partially stop motion animated was a real treat.  Oh yeah in closeups it is a giant rubber prop but those few moments of animation make it worthwhile. There is enough plot here for 2 movies and it does not always make perfect sense but the action will keep your attention.  Oh and look closely at that dragon.  David Hewitt borrowed some of the stopmotion scenes for his no budget thriller THE MIGHTY GORGA.";

Animationwise the film was a major disappointment.And otherwise? Well you gotta give this movie a big A for Ambition. Hercules excuse me GOLIATH doesn't just duke it out with soldiers he battles a three headed dog a bat monster a centaur a bear and at one point even wrestles an elephant to the ground! Unfortunately none of these conflicts is handled with anything like the skill needed to really bring them off but you've gotta love them for trying.

	schema:reviewBody "A wellmade for the genre expensivelooking apart from the special effects peplum vehicle for Mark Forest here dressed up to look just like Steve Reeves. GOLIATH AND THE DRAGON is one of the more impressive peplum adventures and contains some very good scenes in its running time. Sure the expected court shenanigans romance and plot twists are all present and correct but the action  when it comes  is very good indeed and a mustsee for fans of cheesy monsters.The opening couldn't be better as it has Goliath climbing down a huge pit to retrieve the stolen blood diamond from the statue of his beloved wind goddess. It turns out that the diamond was stolen by the troops of Eurystheus Broderick Crawford and thrown into the pit for Goliath to retrieve. You see there's a dragon lurking in the pit which Eurystheus hopes will kill Goliath. What do you think will happen? You're right Goliath will manage to kill the dragon singlehandedly but that doesn't happen until the end of the film. For now we have to make do with some cool impressive stopmotion animation of the dragon hunting through the cave a first for the peplum genre? I've a feeling that this may have been inserted by American producers as I've certainly never seen any sign of stopmotion in other Italian peplum movies they didn't have the budget for one thing. Still it's a big surprise and a big plus for the film as I love stopmotion.Goliath's first obstacle is a dangerous firebreathing threeheaded dog which is guarding the entrance to the cave. After a few thwacks from Goliath's sword it immediately plays dead thus letting him enter  still it provided a nice spectacle. Incidentally spectacle is what GOLIATH AND THE DRAGON is all about and it provides oodles of it which is why I rate it so highly it may be cheesy and unrealistic but the spirit of the film is actionpacked and a whole lot of fun! Goliath wanders into some very impressive mistenshrouded underground caverns full of bubbling lakes and lurking danger. Sure enough he's soon attacked by a cheesy flying winged monster but beats it out of the sky! After retrieving his precious diamond Goliath retreats and the rest of the film until the ending takes place aboveground with some less impressive more standard human intrigue.Broderick Crawford hams for all his worth as the cruel tyrant Eurystheus whom one character so memorably calls a mass of fat and muscle full of violence and brutality!. Crawford is miscast yes but provides a worthwhile villain for Goliath to face  the only trouble is that he looks so physically unfit that you feel he might keel over and die at any minute! The rest of the cast is made up of Goliath's troubleseeking younger brother who doesn't share his sibling's love of bodybuilding obviously some supposed Italian beauties and lots of marching soldier types. Amid all the usual dialogue neardeath moments and swooning females Goliath proves his worth by chucking rocks pulling down trees and temples and fighting a grizzly bear or a maninasuit depending on how gullibleperceptive you may be! Great fun worth watching.Eventually Eursytheus kidnaps Goliath's brother and has him tied to a cross intending to make an elephant trample him in a surprisingly grisly little moment. Thankfully Goliath comes to the rescue on his chariot fighting off the elephant singlehandedly  well he makes it sit down in the end!  and escaping again. But the fun isn't over yet. You see Crawford has a creepy snake pit in his dungeon into which he lowers beautiful women as a torture device! This means that Goliath is up to his arms in rescuing people and righting wrongs.In a memorable plot twist Goliath actually falls foul of the gods causing the sky to turn purple  cool! A centaur seen only at a distance called Polymorphus appears to kidnap Goliath's love interest only to receive a spear in the back for its troubles. It hands over the fainted lady to Crawford before dying who proceeds to chain her up as dragon bait. This leads to another cool scene in which Goliath bravely battles the mechanical monstrosity which is defeated fairly easily it has to be said! It's all about spectacle again...after Goliath slays the dragon and has his girlfriend kidnapped AGAIN he storms Crawford's palace with his small army but not before singlehandedly destroying the foundations of the place from underground.A wellstaged battle ensues and the film culminates with Crawford falling into his own snakepit and dying  a hilarious sight. Somewhat bizarrely the most beautiful actress is also bitten and dies but I guess even Goliath can't have everything! The Les Baxter score is appropriately spooky and exciting when needs must Mark Forest looks the part and has some choice dialogue as Goliath and the sets and costumes are spoton. In all an actionpacked and fastpaced adventure and in my mind one of the best films of the genre! I highly recommend Something Weird Video's print of this movie which is as they say crystal clear and impressively letterboxed  go get it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Goliath and the Dragon was one of two peplum films featuring Hercules the other being The Loves of Hercules' released in 1960 following the success of Hercules and its sequel both starring Steve Reeves. The original Italian title for this film is La vendetta di Ercole The Revenge of Hercules but U.S. distributor AIP changed the hero to Goliath for the American release and added a stopmotion animation dragon not included in the Italian cut. ItalianAmerican Brooklynborn bodybuilder Lou Degni billed as Mark Forest takes over the role from Reeves. Forest starred in a dozen or so peplum films including Maciste in the Valley of the Kings released this same year and played Hercules again in 1964's Hercules Against the Sons of the Sun. He is a more than passable standin for Reeves impressively built if not quite as classically handsome or wellproportioned and able to pull off the macho arrogance of the character. The oddest thing about this film is the casting of American actor Broderick Crawford with an enormous and distracting scar across his face as Hercules's or Goliath's ... whatever nemesis. Crawford growls his way through the movie and generally seems like a grumpy old man. At least he gets to use his name which neither the film nor the writers nor the lead actor nor the hero do  cowriter Nicolo Ferrari is credited with the bizarre pseudonym Archibald Zounds Jr.! Apologies to anyone actually named Archibald Zounds Jr. or Sr.The story is particularly baroque involving forbidden romance doublecrossing courtiers an overlarge cast of characters that becomes cumbersome to keep straight and some vague plans to defeat Hercules and conquer Thebes but the overall motif in keeping with the Italian title is revenge with Hercules at one point destroying the statue of the God of Vengeance after it falls on him  twice! The real attraction here though is not the complicated plot but the dizzying array of cheesy monsters Hercules gets to fight beginning with a sequence in the cave of horrors where the big man defeats a threeheaded beast that is probably supposed to be Cerebus though not identified as such another pseudonymous indignity and a very strange mansized batlike creature that at first I thought was a unique take on the dragon but as it turns out a more conventional though frankly pretty hilarious dragon turns up later. Along the way Hercules also defeats a giant bearlike monster and spears a centaur who is the most convincing and strangely affecting of all the creatures that populate the film. The batthing and the bearthing are clearly stuntmen in silly costumes but the dragon aside from the brief stopmotion sequence is a giant puppet that Forest does a great job trying to battle convincingly. Other peplum tropes include the obligatory dancing girls and Hercules practically tearing down a city with his bare hands. Though much cheaper looking and cheesier than the two Reeves films that preceded it this is actually pretty fun and peppy peplum entry helmed by director Vittorio Cottafavi.".

Apologies to anyone actually named Archibald Zounds Jr. or Sr.The story is particularly baroque involving forbidden romance doublecrossing courtiers an overlarge cast of characters that becomes cumbersome to keep straight and some vague plans to defeat Hercules and conquer Thebes but the overall motif in keeping with the Italian title is revenge with Hercules at one point destroying the statue of the God of Vengeance after it falls on him  twice! The real attraction here though is not the complicated plot but the dizzying array of cheesy monsters Hercules gets to fight beginning with a sequence in the cave of horrors where the big man defeats a threeheaded beast that is probably supposed to be Cerebus though not identified as such another pseudonymous indignity and a very strange mansized batlike creature that at first I thought was a unique take on the dragon but as it turns out a more conventional though frankly pretty hilarious dragon turns up later. Along the way Hercules also defeats a giant bearlike monster and spears a centaur who is the most convincing and strangely affecting of all the creatures that populate the film. The batthing and the bearthing are clearly stuntmen in silly costumes but the dragon aside from the brief stopmotion sequence is a giant puppet that Forest does a great job trying to battle convincingly. Other peplum tropes include the obligatory dancing girls and Hercules practically tearing down a city with his bare hands. Though much cheaper looking and cheesier than the two Reeves films that preceded it this is actually pretty fun and peppy peplum entry helmed by director Vittorio Cottafavi.";

	schema:reviewBody "For a sword and sandal movie Goliath and the Dragon has about the most convoluted and ridiculously hard to follow plot that I can remember. It was kind of like watching two or more different movies at the same time where the pieces just never seem to fit into a cohesive whole. Based on what I did get out of it King Eurystheus Broderick Crawford has it out for Goliath. He kidnaps Goliath's brother Illus and when that doesn't work he kidnaps Goliath's wife. King Eurystheus also has the hots for a babe about a third his age who just happens to be in love with Illus. To win her over King Eurystheus takes the reasoned approach of having her imprisoned as well. In the meantime Goliath is off doing battle with a threeheaded dog a giant flying bat creature a wifesnatching centaur and a dragon that can't seem to decide whether it's a stopmotion creature or a big goofy looking puppet. In the end Goliath literally brings down the walls of King Eurystheus' fortress and with the help of an army from Thebes saves the day.Overall Goliath and the Dragon is a real mixed bag  hence my very average 510 rating. There's a lot about the movie I enjoyed. The beyond cheesy fight scenes with the various creatures I mentioned is an obvious place to start. These scenes are just plain old fun. I also enjoyed the scenes of prisoners being crushed by a trained elephant. You don't see stuff like that everyday. Watching Goliath tackle the elephant was a hoot. But when Goliath and the Dragon is bad it's real bad. Some of the acting is painful. Mark Forest the requisite body in this sword and sandal epic is about as wooden as you'll find in one of these movies. He moves in a very unnatural manner that looked odd to me for lack of a better word. And what's Broderick Crawford doing in this movie? He's so out of place I often felt embarrassed for him. Another big negative for me is how deathly dull much of the movie is. When Goliath's not fighting some creature the movie can be terribly sleep inducing. Too many unnecessarily confusing plot points too many characters I didn't know or care about and too many scenes with nothing going on  not the sign of a what I'd call a good movie. Like I said Goliath and the Dragon is a real mixed bag.".

Actually now that I've given it another look it's not worse than most other peplums  though certainly not up to Cottafavi's best work THE 100 HORSEMEN 1964 but his offbeat framing and vivid sense of color enlivens several sequences to be sure. For the record Cottafavi also made that which is arguably the best Hercules film of all HERCULES AND THE CAPTIVE WOMEN 1961 whose shortened US version alas has just been released on R1 DVD.Anyway the plot kicks into action immediately as Mark Forest playing the titular heman named Hercules in the original Italianlanguage version goes to recover a diamond from a monsterinfested cave which includes a hilarious large cat creature with bat wings which I clearly recall sending the Venice Film Festival audience in hysterics! The villain of the piece is Broderick Crawford who naturally chews up the scenery and approaches the role as if he were playing a gangster at one point he even puts down his equally crooked if actually brighter henchman by calling him a moron...after which Crawford is apparently revitalized and inspired into devising newer and more ingenious traps to spring for Hercules...er...Goliath! The busy plot line of course involves several action setpieces court intrigues much invoking of the Greek gods women threatened with torture...and more laughable monsters the dragon of the English title is so cheap that only its head ever makes any significant appearance. There is the usual coterie of maidens in these mythological epics who thankfully are very easy on the eyes here especially Leonora Ruffo as Goliath's wife she went on to repeat the role in Mario Bava's HERCLUES IN THE HAUNTED WORLD 1961 and Gaby Andre' as a duplicitous slave who also falls for Goliath.The version I watched this time around via Alpha's DVD was the AIP Englishdubbed and rescored one by the ubiquitous Les Baxter surprisingly it was a widescreen print  but the colors were way too much on the red side so that I had to tone down the colors on my TV set to make the whole thing viewable!P.S.

But for fans of silly and stupid films it's worth seeing this one through to the end.When Hercules I mean 'Goliath' returns his brother Illus is oddly indifferent. Apparently Illus is an annoying and pouty young man who is easily influenced by Theaa bad girl who has twisted Illus' mind against Goliath. In addition there are some other baddies led by Crawford who want to kill Goliath. I never really understood the intrigues and frankly I don't think this was really my faultthe plot was pretty crazy and confusing. Instead watching Goliath fight against guys in bear suits and a lot of other stupid creatures is THE reason to watch this very bad film.Pathetic and stupidthis is among the worst of the HerculesGoliathMaciste films. If you enjoyed laughing at this mess of a film also try Hercules Vs. the Moon Menperhaps the only movie of this type that is even stupider than this one!".

Castellari and Franco Nero have here returned to familiar territory with perhaps a broader and more accessible read not quite as good vision of much the same character. Or at least he has the same hat.While Jonathan Degli Orsi doesn't have the uncompromising feverish fantasy feel of its predecessor it is perfectly convincing in its chosen setting a forested wilderness about to be exploited by a wouldbe oil magnate John Saxon that is currently inhabited by an Indian tribe and their sacred burial ground. Enter Jonathan Nero an orphaned white man of Polish descent who has been raised by bears and the aforementioned tribe. After leaving his adoptive family to seek revenge for his parents' murder a quest which has brought him face to face with the futility of his rage he returns to his true people the ones who raised him only to find them under attack by the world he wants nothing to do with.And what do you think he does?This film could be seen as Castellari and Nero's answer to the previous year's Unforgiven as it both pays tribute to and meditates on themes of the Western genre the meditation is coming from a similarly aged and wisened point of view. For my money this particular meditationtribute is more clever more accomplished and has a much wider scope. It is beautifully filmed excellently acted and superbly written. It has a soundtrack that while not having much to do with Spaghetti Westerns enhances the story quite well. In one way it improves over Keoma in that it contains songs with lyrics that actually COMPLIMENT the film rather than taking away from it.This film's winks and nods to the bygone Spaghetti genre are all quite clever some of them made me laugh out loud. Watch as Castellari actually provides a realworld explanation for the mysterious fog that always rolls in for the climactic shootout. There's also a great scene that I'm sure was meant to evoke Django the Bastard as well as plenty of references to the director's own Keoma. What's really cool though is that this film doesn't try to BE a Spaghetti Western while doing this. It finds its own place in the scheme of things. It very much feels like a nineties kind of film but a damn good one.Castellari's Peckinpahstyle action has come a long way and is a pleasure to watch. The actor who plays Jonathan as a child is quite good and has an uncanny charisma. I would definitely urge fans of Keoma Castellari and Nero to seek out this rather difficulttofind film. Like I said I was not disappointed.I would also encourage fans of Dances With Wolves type dramas to check out this one and see how it ought to be done.".

Castellari.As some you know the Italian film industry was in complete disarray by the end of the 1980's as they failed to be able to compete against American films and video sales. By 1990 Italian film was relegated mostly to low budget art films and TV movies but in the early 90's the dissolution of the Soviet Union brought about a continuance of the spirit of cooperation between Italy and Russia not enjoyed much since the early 70's. Several big budget coproductions emerged in these first few years but largely became fiasco's such as the only recently finished QUIET FLOWS THE DON and the everlanguishing GENGHIS KHAN. In the true spirit of Italian copycat filmmaking with DANCES WITH WOLVES garnering much critical and financial praise at the time it only made sense to try a Spaghetti Western in the vast expanses of the largely untouched motherland. Hire on Castellari who in turn brings a few of his regulars but strangely no Romano Puppo David Hess John Saxon and you get a highly entertaining oddly cast and strangely themed last gasp of a nearly forgotten genre.Franco Nero produces put up the money in a retread down memory lane and plays a part that would have better suited him 15 years earlier and it did when it was called KEOMA as a gunslinger raised by Indians and befriended by a bear. He's out for revenge against the thugs who killed his birth parents while trying to stop an evil politician Saxon from ruining the environment with oil prospecting plus he still has an old rivalry to settle with his step brother. There's also a local ruffian played by Roderigo Obregon I am guessing that he was being groomed by the Italian film industry to be the next Werner Pochath  to play a creepy sleaze bag in every film who kidnaps Nero's woman.While this is easily one of Enzo's most technically polished films... especially in terms of cinematography with MANY beautiful shots JONATHAN is lacking much of the fun and originality of Enzo's previous efforts. It's still a good film but pales in comparison to KEOMA to which it owes very much if not everything. Characteristically for Castellari it's loaded with slow motion though editor Moriani is no Amicucci or Tomassi and there's a few film injokes like the chief villain Goodwin being named after Enzo's soninlaw Greg Goodwin. Many of the action sequences are rather unbelievable or borderline ridiculous and a lot of the Native American extras look more like Kazakhs or Uzbekhs to me but I'm just nitpicking.Considering the rest of Italy's output at the time it's amazing this film is as good as it is. A shame it never got a proper distribution as well as a shame that it didn't rekickstart Castellari's career.".

This newer venture shares with that earlier one not only its Western setting and a similarly grizzled longhaired hero but also a touch of pretentiousness and a painful song score composed by the unsympathetic minstrel figure who appears intermittently throughout! The film starts well enough with the black and white flashback to the hero's traumatic witnessing as a young boy of his parents' slaying by a trio of greedy badmen after their gold while the segments featuring the boy's interaction with a playful bear cub are also quite amiable. However we have seen the white man among the Redskins scenario  albeit incongruously played here by Mongols  which follows soon after complete with their seemingly interminable quasimystical passages far too often for those scenes to propose anything new. Equally predictable are David Hess' villainous overtaking of a town Nero falling foul of Hess and his henchmen and their various confrontations interestingly Hess had to complete his part in a short space of time because he couldn't get along with Nero  with whom he had previously acted in HITCHHIKE 1977.Things are enlivened by the late entrance of powerful entrepreneur John Saxon who with his aged group of gunslingers wipes the town clean of Hess and their unaccountably campy rivals  a group of studsporting leatherwearing barechested musclemen!! Like Keoma before him Franco Nero's character here occasionally steps outside of himself and is witness to his own past experiences as a child also he suffers greatly at the hands of the current villain including crucifixion. The climactic confrontation staged again as was KEOMA's in a barnyard is appropriately rousing and ends the film on a positive note which redeems some of its earlier flaws.".

The film comes off as pretentious propaganda tackling numerous themes unsuccessfully the most blatant and offensive being racial prejudice and oil production. And naturally given its release date when revisionist Westerns were all the rage in Hollywood we're deprived of proper bloody action and served CBS miniseries drama and cues. I counted only one decent slowmo Enzo battle and that consisted mainly of dangerous horse stunts not balletic squibs and shooting spray. The bear subplot was a new idea albeit handled with a lacking child performance which somehow finds its way into every dramatic arc for the rest of the feature. The most amusing instant comes during a fight where the participants turn into their younger counterparts! The lil' cub was pretty cute though.David Hess and John Saxon provide some legitimate villainry. Even Enzo's reallife papa adds a bearded grittiness to his role. On the technical side this is the most polished work Castellari has done. Gone are the paintball squibs shoddy camerawork and cheap pyrotechnics but all this guerrilla charm is a trade off for the stock orchestral music and dramatic fodder.

	schema:headline " While this film was somewhat entertaining this movie is not so high on my great Spaghetti Western list. It was a bit under cooked but watchable.";
	schema:reviewBody "Being a huge fan of Spaghetti Westerns I found this movie directed by Fred Ringold AKA Fernando Cerchio to be very fun to watch. However there was one thing about the film that kinda ruin the movie for me the main character Loring Vandervelt Peter Lee Lawrence. Don't get me wrong Peter Lee Lawrence isn't a bad actor. It sucks that he died really young at age 30 due to glioblastoma cancer but his character in this film was very badly written. The stupid things he does throughout this film are irritating. Because of that this film felt like a dumber and sillier Zapata version of 2007's 'No Country for Old Men' with Loring finding stolen money taken from Mexican banditos and unwisely using the money for selfish reasons bringing unwatched attention to himself. While Loring's actions does drive the plot along his bad decision making feels out of place and forced even with the awful confusing twist toward the end. It doesn't add up compare to the scenes he makes very clever and smart decisions. Honestly I can think of many other ways the movie could had done this better like having Loring's sister Daphne Agns Spaak find the money and spent it without Loring or Mark Harrison Louis Dawson AKA Luis Dvila's knowledge. It would give more reason for her character to be in this film plus it would build more tension between the two gunslingers. Since the movie didn't do this Daphne felt like a bothersome show stopper distraction. She really does slow the movie down with the whole deeply religious father subplot. It goes nowhere. Despite that I have to say I kinda dig most of the supporting cast. Luis Dvila does wonder as the solo mysterious gruff type character. Even the out of the top somewhat racism cartoony caricatured stereotype of Mexican bandits of General Valiente Tano Cimarosa  his assistant Augustine Jesus Guzmn was fun to watch. The movie has some of the best scenes with them. Tons of great jokes are play out with them like General Valiente forcing a man to eat paper ordering Augustine to get his sombrero or tossing devotional scapular and rosaries whenever he think a Saint has failed him. A part of me really wanted these guys to win. They were really fun to see! Another character that I like was Nelo Pazzafini as a billiard player yet I do understand he was a character that does not contribute anything to the main plot. However he was so funny! That's one thing the movie does so well. It has a very good sense of humor. Who knew that a title like 'Death of High Mountain' with little to no mountain could be so hilarious? The writers Jos Mallorqu Lorenzo Gica Palli and Eduardo Manzanos Brochero who also produced the film must had been high when writing this movie. It seems to me that the writers of 1970's They Call Me Trinity' could had been influence a little bit from this film with the oddball relationship between Mark and Loring. Who knows!? All I know is this movie has one of the best saloon fistfight scenes ever with everybody going at it. Yes it could be seem as cheesy  generic but it did put a smile in my face. Another great thing about this film is the music by Luis Enriquez. It really does bring the funny epic side of the film to life. It was very catchy. However the movie is somewhat rare. Hard to find due to the movie being often recopy and dubbed in many languages. It doesn't help that the movie originally titled was call 'sin breathless' making it sound like a romantic erotic thriller. Another problem is how familiar the stolen loot plot is to other films at the time. It really doesn't stand out much besides it humorous tone. It so plain that the producers didn't even bother renewing their copyright and since then the movie has fallen in public domain. So it's pretty easy to find really bad transfer grainydiscolored DVD copies of this film on online. Overall While this movie is not very successful at the Italian box office still overtime this movie could earn a cult status once enough people see it. In the end I highly recommended watching. Just note that is not great but it's not too bad as well. It just meh.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie opens with the familiar scene of Mexican highwaymen robbing an army wagon. These bandits have assistance though as you then see them divide the loot between themselves and an American associate. Meanwhile in the nearby town of Two Arrows a dastardly youth named Loring Vandervelt Peter Lee Lawrence is trying to find his way in life. All while a mysterious stranger sporting a black hat has just moved into town Luis Dvila. There is not as much violence or skullduggery as one might expect from a Spaghetti flick despite a fair share of shootouts. Instead the tone of the movie is more akin to it's American contemporaries rather than the purposely cynical Italian western's made around this time. The humor of the film varies in quality. Many jokes fall flat but a few like the Mexican general drawing storyboards for his attackplan are genuinely funny.The actors all do a fine serviceable job. Lawrence depicts the naive yet optimistic and charismatic role his character calls for while Luis Dvila nails the part as a laconic loner. The same can be said for the movies directing and cinematography. The plot moves along at a solid pace sporting enough twistsandturns to keep you interested with a few genuinely surprising moments to stir things around a bit. The English title Death on High Mountain is completely nonsensical and do not reflect the film at all.Lastly there are some rather undignifying portrayals of Mexicans in this movie even by the standards of the day. The Hispanic gunmen are basically crude jocular caricatures. Overall it's a pretty average flick. 610".

And then the dance with the dancing sensation Helen in Ayaya Karume Kya Suku Suku? And finally the romantic songs Ehsaan Tera Hoga by both the late Mohd Rafi and the nightingale of India Lata Mangeshkar? This film was Saira Banu's first film and it was opposite the then top actor Shammi Kapoor who is known as Elvis Presley of Hindi cinema now more famously called Bollywood. Born into a family who has extremely strong and perhaps even draconian rules which also includes no one allowed to laugh in the household fall in love or even go out led by the old time favourite dreaded mother played by Lalita Pawar who heads the family and Chandra Shekhar Shammi Kapoor as her son who even those working for him consider him and call him Junglee. But there is his sister Shashikala who is totally the opposite of him and the mother. She laughs and likes to go out and meet her boyfriend who happens to be a clerk in Chandra Shekhar's firm. Naturally the mother suspects that her daughter is up to something and sends her packing with the brother on a holiday to Kashmir. Here there some very hilarious scenes with Chandra Shekhar and Raj Saira Banu whenever they meet. But then the fate takes a turn and the god of love firs an arrow and love starts to blossom and Chandra Shekhar realises what he has missed all his life and the sister is absolutely shocked and cannot believe that it is her brother behaving in the way he now is.With the combination of the late Mohd Rafi Shammi Kapoor and Shankar Jaikeshen as the composers one knew at the time that the music and the songs had to be good. In one scene Raj the character played by Saira Banu calls Chandra Shekhar a Bunder monkey and in true sense of the word it can be said that his expressions until romance starts to blossom are that of the monkey. Related to Naseem Banu an old time favourite actress Saira Banu is perfect in this role.Shashikala who later played roles similar to that of being an evil mother  in  law or sister  in  law who falls in love with a clerk in her brother's company is perhaps a flamboyant here as she is totally the opposite of her brother and her mother. The part of her lover is played by the late Ashok Kumar's Dadamoni's brother Anoop Kumar who is good in supporting Shammi Kapoor in this film.Finally the rock of the family Lalita Pawar who controls everything in terms of rules of the house. She is just perfect as an authoritarian character who is stubborn and will do whatever she can to ensure that her late husband's rules are carried on.This movie for those who watched it when first released 47 years ago will take down memory lane which has some of the most memorable songs by Mohd Rafi Lata Mangeshkar and is supported by good excellent comedy and scenery of Kashmir as well romance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Flawless' is an offbeat story about Walter Koontz Robert De Niro an excop who suffers a stroke and loses partial ability to speak.  In an effort to regain some of his speech capabilities it is recommended to him that he take singing lessons.  So he decides to ask his neighbor Rusty Philip Seymour Hoffman who is a female impersonator to give him singing lessons.  This is an unlikely pairing because Walter is a belligerent homophobe.This film was written and directed by Joel Schumacher.  His story though peculiar makes some powerful points.  This is a story about hatred bigotry and reconciliation.  Walter learns through his disability who his friends really are and who they are not.  It seems that the people he hates treat him a lot better than the people he thought he loved.  Ultimately he is able to look past his prejudices to find the human elements that make him and Rusty not so different after all.This was an excellent character study of both main characters giving a lot of insight into the motivations and lives of each.  Unfortunately the story meanders too often to irrelevant characters and scenes that don't really contribute much like the Gay Republicans.  Schumacher would have been better to concentrate on the relationship between Walter and Rusty rather than digressing so frequently into Rusty's relationships with his friends.De Niro was outstanding in this film.  Not only was he excellent in the emotional portrayal of a man having to deal with a sudden debilitating stroke but he was very realistic in his portrayal of the physical disability itself.  The combination of his struggles to do the simplest of tasks and the obvious look of anguish and frustration on his face was poignant and affecting.Hoffman brought a lot of emotional energy to his part and his imitation of a drag queen was passable though somewhat forced and unnatural.  Wilson Jermaine Heredia who played ChaCha the winner of the Flawless contest was a much more convincing queen.I rated this film a 710.  This is a good film that helps us understand that the remedy for the fear wrought of our differences is understanding not hatred.  In that respect it makes an important contribution.  If cross dressing and blatantly gay themes put you off perhaps you should defy your inclinations and see it.".

The two of them were marvelous  and the end of the film had an outtake of Hoffmann and DeNiro practicing The Name Game that alone was worth the entire movie.  There were certainly stereotypes among the minor characters but the plot was good and so was the acting.  My acting teacher used to describe playsfilms like Virginia Wolff as love stories. Using his criteria of two people coming together sharing experiences and touching each other's hearts  Flawless certainly qualifies as an atypical love story.".

The two of them were marvelous  and the end of the film had an outtake of Hoffmann and DeNiro practicing The Name Game that alone was worth the entire movie.  There were certainly stereotypes among the minor characters but the plot was good and so was the acting.  My acting teacher used to describe playsfilms like Virginia Wolff as love stories. Using his criteria of two people coming together sharing experiences and touching each other's hearts  Flawless certainly qualifies as an atypical love story.";

	schema:reviewBody "An unlikely bond is formed between a conservative retired New York City cop who has suffered a stroke and a drag queen in Flawless' written and directed by Joel Schumacher.  Walter Koontz Robert De Niro is paralyzed on his right side his speech is impaired and he can barely walk to overcome his speech difficulties he is encouraged by his doctor to try singing lessons which in some cases like his have proved effective.  Toward that end he hires Rusty Zimmerman Philip Seymour Hoffman a neighbor in his apartment building who performs at a local club in town.  Formerly at odds with one another the two form an alliance for their mutual benefit Walter needs help and Rusty needs the money. De Niro as always turns in an outstanding performance here so physically convincing and shading Walter's disability with such finesse that you forget that this is an actor playing a role.  Such is the magic De Niro can weave on the screen.  Hoffman too is excellent as Rusty the tortured soul who wouldn't wish his life on anyone and who can readily identify with Walter's newly acquired sense of isolation and helplessness.  He understands selfpity and tries to help Walter get past his own.  There is nuance to his performance through which he conveys so well Rusty's subtle anxieties and the feeling of rancor that surrounds him and with which he must live every day of his life.  Also notable in a supporting role is Skipp Sudduth as Walter's friend Tommy who must deal with his own confusion in dealing with Walter's situation and the people with whom he now finds him involved. Previous to the stroke drag queens were definitely not a part of their immediate circle of friends. The supporting cast includes Barry Miller Leonard Christopher Bauer Jacko Daphne RubinVega Tia and Karina Arrovave Amber.  Schumacher has deftly crafted a character study that examines diversity and proffers the rewards of a symbiotic existence.  The message here is that no one is flawless we're imperfect creatures living together in an imperfect world and if we can only get beyond ourselves and our prejudices we just may find that gold at the end of the rainbow.  Flawless' is not without it's own flaws either some of the scenes involving the other drag queens and some of the criminal elements involved are somewhat overplayed at times but that's a minor complaint.  This film is deeply felt without being sentimental and sheds some light on the human condition.  It holds up a mirror to all of us and asks the flawless among us to step forward.  I rate this one 710.".

As therapy he is advised to take singing lessons from Rusty Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Their relationship as neighbors goes from antagonism to mutual respect by the end of the film. Money and crooks are involved and Rusty wants to get enough money to have his operations and drug therapy to become the real woman that is inside him.Some of the film is funny some of it too over the top with the drag queens. It moves slowly in places in others there are both good guys and bad guys shot and killed. While I enjoyed the viewing experience for its novelty I probably would not recommend it to friends. I give it a rating of 7 mainly on the good acting of De Niro and the superb acting of Hoffman as the drag queen. We saw him in Almost Famous recently plus Magnolia and Talented Mr Ripley and he is without a doubt one of the finest actors working today.I saw the DVD and while it is fine it is nothing extraordinary. And there are no extras at all which is disappointing. I'm sure there at least could have been some very funny deleted scenes.".

But very few want to talk about the social implications of it.Philip Seymour Hoffman is a female impersonator who lives in the same apartment building as Robert DeNiro a retired policeman who works as a security guard. During a robbery of a drug dealer one of Hoffman's fellow drag performers is killed and DeNiro suffers a stroke trying to prevent the crime. The drug dealers can't exactly go to the police with their story but they have other methods of dealing with transgressors.DeNiro and Hoffman have nothing in common at all and usually confine any conversations they have with some usual shouted epithets. But DeNiro's doctor advises singing lessons as a form of speech therapy and he goes to Hoffman. They develop an unusual friendship.More unusual because it turns out that Hoffman has the stolen loot. And why Hoffman is keeping it is a matter of life and quality thereof.Hoffman is not dressing in drag for effect or to make money as a performer. Hoffman's real drag is the body parts God gave him because they don't match what's inside. Hoffman is a transgendered soul and the cost of a sex change operation is more than he could earn in a few lifetimes.Here in America our insurance companies amazingly regard a sex change as cosmetic surgery. Scary idea but true. Recently I had some talks with a transgender person from the United Kingdom. There the debate is whether their socialized medicine system should be paying for the sex change. Either way it is frightening situation that Hoffman is put in with all that cash suddenly in his possession and the chance of matching heart and soul to body can be realized.Especially after just winning an Oscar for Capote Philip Seymour Hoffman isn't worried about getting cast in gay roles. From the lovestruck Scotty G in Boogie Nights to Flawless and now to Capote Hoffman's making one great career for himself going gay. But all three of those parts show an astonishing range and a courageous player willing to accept and master challenging roles.Of course Robert DeNiro is great he's never anything else. And he's back in the world of lower Manhattan that he knows so well. His character turns out to be a person of great character and more than just physical strength.Flawless is a film that will make you laugh and cry but even more important will make you think.".

	schema:reviewBody "FLAWLESS  1999 12 out of fourBy Blake FrenchSomewhere in Flawless there is a very good movie but it is shuttered by the awkwardness of a jumbled plot. There are two separate stories here and although they are interrelated either one by itself would be enough for a whole movie. Robert De Niro and Philip Seymour Hoffman make a chemistryrich pair both entertaining and amusing and their screen presence is deserving of a lot of attentionit is tragic that not one but two different stories get in the way of their electric charisma together.The first storyline details a homophobic former New York City security officer named Walt Koontz Robert De Niro who at the beginning of the movie has a stroke while rushing to a nearby crime scene. He is burdened with partial paralysis on the right side of his body and speech problems which can be overcome with the help of his neighbor Rusty Zimmerman Philip Seymour Hoffman a flamboyantly gay drag queen who often practices his musically vocal abilities with fellow friends in drag. Walt's physical therapist recommends singing lessons from Rusty.The other story involves a criminal named Mr. Z and his attempts to find the incompetent people who stole a large sum of cash belonging to him. As Walt'z recovery continues and the relationship between him and Rusty becomes more stable various characters must react to the danger of Mr. Z and his clan of criminals.What makes this movie so amusing is the interesting personality clash between the characters of Robert De Niro and Philip Seymour Hoffman. I just wish De Niro's character was more active for much of the production he is nothing but a metronome who is unable to speak or even move much. Some of the elements involving the gay drag queens are hilarious and contribute to the movie's effective mood and Philip Seymour Hoffman is so deliciously clever as Rusty that I would nominate his performance for an Oscar almost immediately. The dialogue is witty and intelligent I need some butch faggots over here. taking advantage of the situations applicable and giving the movie a surprising emotionally gentle side.Not much else of Flawless is gentle though. The overwhelming majority of the movie is gritty rough material intended for adult audiences only. The vulgarism and profanity seemingly never stop and the coarse atmosphere is prevalent. The film is shot in a grainy highcontrast style with excellent cinematography and mood development. None of this shocks us however since the film's director Joel Schumacher was behind such perverse movies like A Time To Kill 8MM and Tigerland.Flawless has a lot of decent material but it just does not fit together because of the plot distractions. Too much plot has never really been an issue for Joel Schumacher in A Time to Kill and 8MM he found focus with a central character here he finds likable traits in two main characters but allows the plot to control their inspirational qualities. If Schumacher were to reexamine this script with a different perspective perhaps cutting the Mr. Z plot entirely maybe it would work more effectively. As it currently stands Flawless is a movie in which the actors work hard to overcome a plot heavy script and they do reign victorious in a few battles but eventually lose the war.".

	schema:reviewBody "I will start by saying RIP Phillip Seymour Hoffman  his acting talents were magnificent and we truly lost a special person. Every one of his films is acted with passion and dedication and Flawless is no different. He is special in this and his portrayal of the fierce drag queen is tender and heartfelt whilst also being fierce and powerful. Robert De Niro is of course brilliant in his role and really did an incredible job playing a stroke survivor  that is no easy feat and he has put his all in to every movement and every word spoken. This film should be watched for the acting talent and energy of these two actors alone as well as the character study of two very interesting people who find themselves with unique challenges to face in life. The cinematography is not top notch the film was made in '99 so it does have a rustic quality but it's perfectly fine. The focus here is on the characters colourful and frantically trying to find connections in a difficult world. They are flawed in some ways through sheer stubborness or quick tempers but they aren't all that different when it comes down to it  they are both flawed in similar ways and maybe that's why their friendship works. It doesn't feel forced  it grows naturally and their chemistry is on fire. I loved this film  it depicts the world of drag queens wonderfully and the difficulties members of the LGBT community faced in the 90's. For the time it was made I applaud it  it hasn't tried to sugar coat anything and it has thrust us in to a layered and colourful and magical environment. Loved it loved it loved it .It's on Netflix UK right now so watch it.".

For outward appearances and in his surroundings Walt appears to be the most together character in the film. But is he? His life is definitely flawed as he has no meaningful contact with another person other than his poker and beer buddies. He seeks a hollow substitution in the dance hall escort he tangos with she is no 'Sweet Charity'!. However Walt is not a hopelessly flawed person which he heroically demonstrates on the night of his stroke as he attempts to assist an unknown neighbor. We feel sympathy and to a degree empathy for Walt's plight as discarded husband and emotionally lost loner.Next comes Rusty. From all external appearances Rusty's difficulties with life are visibly apparent. However if one stops there with Rusty they miss the real story of his flawed existence. Philip Seymour Hoffman steals this film as the female impersonator with wit and a sharp eye for seeing the needs of others. But even though Rusty wrestles with his soontobe trans gender journey he is open and frank about his inner demons which define and offer an explanation of his gender identity crisis. In the end Rusty genuinely connects with Walt because he senses and feels isolation from family and others just as Walt does. We see that Rusty's caring nature is genuine and limitless as he uses his 'operation' money to pay for Walt's treatment after being shot during the film's final scenes. Hoffman truly takes a character that easily could have been portrayed and seen as a one dimensional caricature and turns Rusty into a flawed but three dimensional person of complex needs and inner strength.Flawless is not the human condition. Rather recognizing our flaws and working to change or improve one's life situation becomes the true test of an individual's worth. The 'flawless contest' in the film serves as a microcosm of people's pursuit of perfection in in imperfect world.Surely Rusty and Walt exhibit an inner strength as they find in each other that they have more in common than not.

It's a buddy movie about a drag queen and a homophobic security guard who suffers a nearparalysing stroke. It's written in the style of a GCSE drama piece and directed by Joel Shumacher he of Batman And Robin fame. Not exactly a mouthwatering prospect you say? Perhaps you are wondering why it got a release at all. Well because it stars Robert De Niro and Philip Seymour Hoffman and they are two of the finest actors working in film today.De Niro plays Walt Koontz we know he's the security guard because he has a mantelpiece full of trophies plays cards and eats donuts. Hoffman is Rusty Zimmerman who lives next door he's the drag queen obviously because he's brash claps his hands excitedly and says things like Well life's a bitch so I became one honey!'. After his stroke Koontz has to side step his ultraconservative beliefs and take singing lessons with Rusty as part of his speech therapy. Cue some touching oddcouple moments around the piano and the gradual realisation for Koontz that  shock!  those crazy homos really aren't so bad after all.De Niro played a comparable role to better effect in Awakenings and Hoffman is not as impressive as he was in Happiness or Boogie Nights but the two leads are generally convincing and enjoy some inevitably fantastic moments. The chemistry between the two however which must be tight to drive an essentially theatrical movie like this is distinctly lacking. A European filmmaker with a greater grasp of subtlety would give the characters more time to breathe Almodovar's All About My Mother trod similar territory with electrifying results but Schumacher's dire script insults the audience by assuming that the story needs constant emotional crisis to hold the attention. And so we are provided with deaths gunfights parties and tragic telephone calls all of which are contrived plotdriven devices which demean the relationship between the two central characters to the kind of schmaltzy emotional pornography which usually involves Robin Williams the script stops just short of including an AIDS death or a speech explaining Koontz' hatred of homosexuals although one can be certain it would have had something to do with an abusive father.The treatment of the gay men in the movie though stereotypical does not pander entirely to the expectation of a straight audience as one might accuse Hollywood product like The Birdcage of doing. And as director Schumacher is reasonably accomplished and has thank heavens suppressed his previously flamboyant tendency and instead developed the gritty style he established well in 8mm. Like Curtis Hanson's recently released Wonder Boys the general style and the casting of Hoffman suggests he has been paying heed to independent cinema and that can be no bad thing. But his frequent use of handheld camera fulfils no function whatever and his neon lighting and clichd gangster scenes mostly of the Gimme back my muthafun money bitch' variety more resemble a Tarantino pastiche than a distinctive voice of his own. Add into the mix two entirely irrelevant subplots and an overwhelming weight of tragic over the comic and you are left with a movie that despite some good performances is anything but flawless.".

	schema:reviewBody "A small film filled with laudatory intentions and highpowered star performances Flawless is regrettably better in its individual parts than as a whole.  This most opposite of oppositesattract love stories features a homophobic stroke victim and a lessthangorgeous drag queen who forge an unlikely friendship as neighbors in a rundown apartment located in a crimeinfested section of New York City.In the early part of the film writerdirector Joel Schumacher fills in the backgrounds of this retired cop and this struggling chantreusse drawing parallels between their seemingly alien worlds intercutting for instance between the subdued ambience of a straight dance club and the raucous atmosphere of a noholdsbarred transvestite stage performance.  As the two neighbors brush up against each other in occasional random encounters in hallways and elevators we see the seething hatred that comes from the fear of the unknown and the inexplicable that routinely divides human beings one from another.  Then Walter Koontz is felled by a stroke which leaves him paralyzed on one side and virtually without the ability to speak.  On a doctor's advice Walter swallows his pride and asks Rusty to give him singing lessons to help him regain his speech.Thus the stage is set for a couple of characters who intitially feel they are worldsapart in their lives interests and values to discover the common humanity that lies beneath the surface and actually ties them together.

	onyx:emotionText "A small film filled with laudatory intentions and highpowered star performances Flawless is regrettably better in its individual parts than as a whole.  This most opposite of oppositesattract love stories features a homophobic stroke victim and a lessthangorgeous drag queen who forge an unlikely friendship as neighbors in a rundown apartment located in a crimeinfested section of New York City.In the early part of the film writerdirector Joel Schumacher fills in the backgrounds of this retired cop and this struggling chantreusse drawing parallels between their seemingly alien worlds intercutting for instance between the subdued ambience of a straight dance club and the raucous atmosphere of a noholdsbarred transvestite stage performance.  As the two neighbors brush up against each other in occasional random encounters in hallways and elevators we see the seething hatred that comes from the fear of the unknown and the inexplicable that routinely divides human beings one from another.  Then Walter Koontz is felled by a stroke which leaves him paralyzed on one side and virtually without the ability to speak.  On a doctor's advice Walter swallows his pride and asks Rusty to give him singing lessons to help him regain his speech.Thus the stage is set for a couple of characters who intitially feel they are worldsapart in their lives interests and values to discover the common humanity that lies beneath the surface and actually ties them together.  The stroke as the great leveler makes Walter in particular cognizant of the struggles Rusty has had to undergo as a result of his very noticeable difference.If Flawless had stuck to this twocharacter format it might have been a more powerful film.

The Aboriginal teen in the film is David Gulpilil one of Australia's most celebrated Actors recently seen in Rolfe Heer's awesome film THE TRACKER.";

	schema:reviewBody "This timeless classic Australian masterpiece did not disappoint in the slightest. The cinematography is brilliant the acting is great remember this was 1976 Australia  especially from child actor Greg Rowe who is now all grown up and living with his wife and two kids in Canada. David Gulpilil also provides a wandering Aboriginal man mysticism to the film and he looks quite younger than in Australia but it's like he is playing the same character. A character well suited to him. The area in which it is set is just beautiful and while Storm Boy battles with his needs to see the greater world and gain an education  all I wanted to do when watching was to swap places with him. The film supplies a lot of themes about nurturing growing the circle of life thankyou Lion King isolation friendship and the morality of right and wrong. The battle between life in general and the life the rest of the population says we should be living. The film is funny at times touching sad and inspiring and will make you want a pet pelican!!!Try and get to see this one  I know Target has them for 7 and you can probably pick up at most places for same price  or rent it. One disappointing thing about it  the DVD is a straight copy of an older print  it is not remastered but somehow to me this added to it's age and quality  like a fine port on film.".

It seems to be usually not very sunny which adds to the mood and the visual beauty of the place as well I think the weather is a necessary ingredient in making this such an excellent film. This is the most real movie maybe I've ever seen. A tenyearold boy lives with his father in a shacky though cozy small handbuilt house located right near the beach. Father has a very small fishing boat. We don't see him actually fishing but on the dock preparing to go out or coming back in. He puts food on the table and seems to do a good job caring for his son who loves him. The boy is not in school and this becomes an issue as the story progresses. The boy meets a young Aborigine man in his early 20s one day when he is out on his own as he tends to be sailing on his tiny homemade raft and after encountering each other a second time they become friends. While they are together they find three baby orphan pelicans which Storm Boy adopts. Storm Boy being the nickname given to him by his Aborigine friend. I don't want to tell anymore so as not to ruin it. Let it suffice to say that drama ensues in various ways as the story goes on and it is all moving and as I said very human. It will definitely touch your emotions. I think this is a story everyone could relate to.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bibliothque Pascal 2010 Dir. Hajdu Szabolcs Hungary Los Angeles Film Festival LAFF 2010 image1.jpegAnother film from Berlin was the new Hungarian entry Bibliotheque Pascal the fourth feature from director Szabolcs Hajdu who made a big international splash with a gymnastics film entitled White Palms in 2006. Where White Palms was basically a semiautobiographical docudrama firmly rooted in reality Bibliotheque is an hallucinogenic excursion into the kinkiest recesses of the mind brilliantly lensed by DOP Andras Nagy but firmly rooted in sexual surrealism excessive sadism and masochism and weirdness for weirdness sake. This is the kind of film that makes you wonder if the agony is ever going to end but keeps you glued to your seat just because it's impossible to take your eyes off of the main actress Orsolya TrkIllys a rare beauty of a special type who is shown constantly in lingering closeups.Plot In order to regain custody of her daughter whom she left in the care of her fortune telling aunt Mona TrkIllys has to tell a social worker her story. The tale she spins and the movie we watchis a wild surreal adventure in which people are able to project and enter each other's dreams and our heroine is sold into slavery in a debauched literary brothel in Liverpool where the patrons act out their literarysexual fantasies with Lolita St. Joan and Desdemona.Though this is in theory a Hungarian film the story is set largely in Romania and most of the dialog is in Romanian delivered by a mainly Romanian cast except for the extended sequence in a British brothel where what dialog there is is in a kind of weird Englishl. The story centers on an hypnotically beautiful single mother Mona Orsolya TrkIllys who is halfHungarian halfRomanian and speaks both languages when necessary.

	onyx:emotionText "Bibliothque Pascal 2010 Dir. Hajdu Szabolcs Hungary Los Angeles Film Festival LAFF 2010 image1.jpegAnother film from Berlin was the new Hungarian entry Bibliotheque Pascal the fourth feature from director Szabolcs Hajdu who made a big international splash with a gymnastics film entitled White Palms in 2006. Where White Palms was basically a semiautobiographical docudrama firmly rooted in reality Bibliotheque is an hallucinogenic excursion into the kinkiest recesses of the mind brilliantly lensed by DOP Andras Nagy but firmly rooted in sexual surrealism excessive sadism and masochism and weirdness for weirdness sake. This is the kind of film that makes you wonder if the agony is ever going to end but keeps you glued to your seat just because it's impossible to take your eyes off of the main actress Orsolya TrkIllys a rare beauty of a special type who is shown constantly in lingering closeups.Plot In order to regain custody of her daughter whom she left in the care of her fortune telling aunt Mona TrkIllys has to tell a social worker her story. The tale she spins and the movie we watchis a wild surreal adventure in which people are able to project and enter each other's dreams and our heroine is sold into slavery in a debauched literary brothel in Liverpool where the patrons act out their literarysexual fantasies with Lolita St. Joan and Desdemona.Though this is in theory a Hungarian film the story is set largely in Romania and most of the dialog is in Romanian delivered by a mainly Romanian cast except for the extended sequence in a British brothel where what dialog there is is in a kind of weird Englishl. The story centers on an hypnotically beautiful single mother Mona Orsolya TrkIllys who is halfHungarian halfRomanian and speaks both languages when necessary. At the beginning and at the end of the film she is trying to convince a Romanian social worker that the young daughter she left in the custody of a flaky fortunetelling aunt when she took off for England to work as a prostitute ie. sex slave should be returned to her  and what happens in between is her incredible tale of suffering and bondage in a grotesque British brothel in Liverpool borrowed it would seem from Genet's Balcony with a little input from Dreyer's Passion of Joan of Arc.In this super kinky whorehouse which gives the film its title clients pay to live out literary sex fantasies and Mona is in fact assigned to a room called Joan of Arc.

	schema:reviewBody "One word sums up how I felt while watching W uncomfortable.I went into this film expecting more of an absurdist comedy than a tragedy. The level of realism was far beyond what I expected. For the most part the cast makeup and casting crew did such a good job with the characters that it was very easy to imagine that these were not actors on the screen but the actual people. Josh Brolin's characterization of W was certainly Oscarworthy.Even better than Brolin's part was Phedon Papamichael's photographic direction. The job of the Director of Photography is to bring the story to life through the creation of images to draw the attention of the viewer where the Director wants. Few films are as good of an example of this as W. Papamichael used the camera to force moral and emotional perspective in a way that I have rarely seen outside of the films of Stanley Kubrick. I've only seen the film once viewing it as a complete work. I intend to watch it again to study the photography.Overall I thought the film was fair in its treatment of the actual people involved. The most ardent Bush supporters will not like it but to still be that supportive of him in the final months of his second term you either have to not be paying attention or be uncritical in all of your thought. While artistic license was taken throughout the film the portrayal of all events and people with the possible exception of Dick Cheney were far more grounded in reality and recorded history than I expected.The film made me uncomfortable on multiple levels which is why it succeeds and deserves such a high rating. The portrayal of Bush's relationship with his parents especially his father forces the viewer to feel sorry for him. The overt religiosity that pervades the public service portion of his life must anger anyone who believes strongly in the separation of church and state. There are many moments when with any other characters the film should have generated much laughter. Only one moment in the film actually caused more than one person in the theater to laugh. I guess 4000 dead soldiers drains the humor out of even the most hilarious gaffes.I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a realistic portrayal of historical events. I wish Stone had waited until Bush was out of office to make it though. While it captures the major events that were involved in building the Bush legacy it ends far too early.".

Thandie Newton is hysterically funny as Condie Rice but it's an SNLtype parody not an emotionally honest performance.The film is obviously meticulously researched and carefully considered which is why the sequences that are clearly either utter conjecture or merely political fingerpointing stand out by a mile.Bush  whom I personally despise for his offensive combination of idiocy and selfrighteousness  is treated with fairness and sensitivity. The effort here is obviously to fashion him as a tragic hero a man who genuinely wants to do good but simply doesn't grasp how hard that is especially when surrounded by the likes of Karl Rove and Dick Cheney who is very specifically the villain of the piece as he is in life. And it generally works. I found myself feeling bad for the poor guy.However while trying to make W. a sympathetic character Stone pushes his theme  It Was All To Prove Himself To Daddy way too far. He overplays his hand including a moodbreaking dream sequence near the end. There simply has to be more to George W. Bush than that..... doesn't there? The film ultimately plays much much better when Stone relies on actual transcripts and information gathered by experienced reporters and those sequences whether they are cabinet meetings press conferences or more personal moments snap and zing.".

	schema:reviewBody "With his in the moment biopic W. the normally volatile Oliver Stone wisely saves his judgments for history when hindsight will be 2020. Achingly subdued and slightly satirical Stone plays it straight and to the bone. Here he presents us with the early years of our current lame duck president showing Dubya rushing a frathouse at Yale meeting Laura at a barbecue living in the shadow of his father and brother his troubles holding down a job his failed bid to become baseball commissioner and his defining moment when he gives up drinking and becomes bornagain. All of which leads us to his first term and the Iraq War quagmire where Dubya honesttogoodness truly believes God wanted him to become president and that Iraq did have those rascally WMD.In the lead role Josh Brolin is an endearingly bumbleheaded Dubya and Stone presents him as a simpleminded man with good intentions who has been crippled by his daddy issues and has surrounded himself with the most cynical selfserving and corrupt administration in modern American history. The supporting cast is a hoot with highlights including Thandie Newton eliciting big laughs just with her facial expressions as a wicked and moronically faithful Condi Rice Elizabeth Banks giving a winning portrayal of Laura Bush and Richard Dreyfuss playing Cheney as the most insipid megalomaniac American politics has ever seen.Stone accomplishes three major coups here that should surprise those who expected a onesided liberal smear job. First he humanizes George W. Bush. The director does this with savvy editing showing the backstory of why Dubya does the things he does i.e. why he uses nicknames for everyone or why running three miles every day is so important to him and then juxtaposing that with the inane decisions he has made as president. By utilizing actual transcripts from press conferences news coverage and meetings Stone and scribe Stanley Weiser allow Bush and his administration to speak for themselves and it's both comically cathartic and occasionally frightening to see it dramatized so well. Second he redeems the presidency of George Poppy Bush a somewhat miscast but still effective James Cromwell by showing what a restrained and thoughtful Commander in Chief he was compared to his naive and tooeagertoplease son. Thirdly he redeems the legacy of Colin Powell a surprisingly good Jeffrey Wright who is shown here as the only person in the administration with any hindsight or foresight and the only sane voice who questioned the motives for entering Iraq though he eventually caved in and played along. His fyou to Cheney towards the film's final act is priceless.As the actual presidency still has a few months to go at the time of the film's release Stone's biopic was never written a true ending leaving us with a symbolic image of Dubya looking up to the sky in center field waiting to catch a ball that will never drop. It may be another twenty years before we can pass any accurate judgment on Dubya's legacy and likewise Stone's film will have to wait. It's going to be a long time before anyone catches all those balls George W. Bush's administration threw up in the air.".

	schema:reviewBody "I used to be an Oliver Stone fan. But after Natural Born Killers I read in an interview that he had doubts about continuing his directing career. I don't think I have another good movie in me.Well I still think that he does but W. isn't it. The reason I like and watch Oliver Stone films is that he has a strong opinion about a subject. One that isn't mainstream but expresses it in such a way that he wins his audience and therefore can change popular opinion. The best examples for this are Platoon and JFK.Oliver Stone makes a decision with this film which I do not like. The life and times of George W. Bush offer enough subject matter to make a powerful semidocumentary film with hard hitting political and religious views that would sturr up popular belief. But instead of going for the jugular Stone takes W. on his knee pats him gently on the head and says I know son. I get it. The film has all the elements that make W. the infamous guy that he is the invention of axesofevil God is on the side of good The US of A W.'s history of failed business talechasing and alcohol abuse. Add the wheeling and dealing by the Bushdynasty and you would think it's dynamite stuff.But it's not. The script is superficial. Tame at best. Stone is not good at satire and this film shows us why. Anyone who reads the Sundaypaper and watches the nineoclock news could have written this movie. It has the character motivation of a soapopera. The fatherson relationship for me was totally unbelievable. I expected a true depiction with close source material. But it has become an imagined portrait by the screenwriter. Another thing that disappointed me was the lack of insight into the kitchen of the rightwing BushAdministration more over the infiltration of the Hawks in the White House. This film doesn't add anything new or reveal any new insights. The movie is based on research done by outsiders. I knew every detail of this movie because I am up to current events. I don't want a summation and lovable depiction of a man who is responsible for eight very defining years of US foreign policy. I wanted new insights make me doubt my own beliefs and discuss this with friends and on message boards. The end result has me shrugging my shoulders and saying Eehh... so what?".

One that isn't mainstream but expresses it in such a way that he wins his audience and therefore can change popular opinion. The best examples for this are Platoon and JFK.Oliver Stone makes a decision with this film which I do not like. The life and times of George W. Bush offer enough subject matter to make a powerful semidocumentary film with hard hitting political and religious views that would sturr up popular belief. But instead of going for the jugular Stone takes W. on his knee pats him gently on the head and says I know son. I get it. The film has all the elements that make W. the infamous guy that he is the invention of axesofevil God is on the side of good The US of A W.'s history of failed business talechasing and alcohol abuse. Add the wheeling and dealing by the Bushdynasty and you would think it's dynamite stuff.But it's not. The script is superficial. Tame at best. Stone is not good at satire and this film shows us why. Anyone who reads the Sundaypaper and watches the nineoclock news could have written this movie. It has the character motivation of a soapopera. The fatherson relationship for me was totally unbelievable. I expected a true depiction with close source material. But it has become an imagined portrait by the screenwriter. Another thing that disappointed me was the lack of insight into the kitchen of the rightwing BushAdministration more over the infiltration of the Hawks in the White House. This film doesn't add anything new or reveal any new insights. The movie is based on research done by outsiders. I knew every detail of this movie because I am up to current events. I don't want a summation and lovable depiction of a man who is responsible for eight very defining years of US foreign policy. I wanted new insights make me doubt my own beliefs and discuss this with friends and on message boards. The end result has me shrugging my shoulders and saying Eehh... so what?";

	schema:headline " W. Movie Review a review originally written for college";
	schema:reviewBody "'W.' Oliver Stone's latest true story film is a simple biopic of America's 43rd President George W. Bush touching on certain aspects of his life including his college life his alcoholism and his relationship with his father the 41st president George Bush while revolving mainly around his first term in the white house specifically his controversial 'war on terror' and search for WMDs in Iraq. Like any biopic there are two ways for it to be viewed. The first is how the feature stands as a film on its own regardless of its comparison to the source material. Obviously the other way of perceiving it is to compare it to the source material considering it's about something real and about real people who are alive or have lived. Unfortunately 'W.' is a movie that isn't particularly strong with either of these angles in mind.The film's light and sweet perspective which portrays George W. Bush as a smart and well meaning guy with flaws like the rest of us doesn't balance with the fact that many of the scenes drone on. This is significant especially for audience members with no particular political expertise which arguably this film should appeal to. Its father and son story has no real interesting conflict either except for early on which isn't a good place to have focus since we're meant to be kept sitting around for the duration of the 2 hours of which this film runs. The structure of the film is confusing and the ending itself falls flat leaving a hole that the audience may not be able to fill themselves seemingly trying to make tough point about whatever issues the film is attempting to cover.In terms of comparing the film to the real subjects of which it is based on 'W.' has even less to show for itself as the film focuses on the less interesting or more widely known pieces of just Bush's first term and almost completely avoids the interesting material. Examples of said material would be the controversial speculation around the legitimacy of his position as president the even more questionable aspects of Bush's behaviour around the time of the 911 terrorist attacks and the film even makes absolutely no mention of Hurricane Katrina.The performances in this film are the only real things it has to brag about as Josh Brolin carries the film quite nicely with his charming and quirky take on Bush along with Richard Dreyfuss' Dick Cheney Thandie Newton's Condoleezza Rice and others. However these still feel like impressions granted they are rather good impressions. Another problem with the film's performances is James Cromwell's portrayal of George Bush Sr. as he is shown as a sweet hard working old man with no similarities shown in the real George Bush Sr.'s speech or mannerisms which I guess was necessary to make the character likable.Overall 'W.' is reasonably entertaining with its imitations of the American president and the people surrounding him in his career however the viewers shouldn't delude themselves into thinking it as a reliable source of historical or political information as it covers any subject it has chosen to include very lightly giving very little for it to say despite the fact that there would be many things for this film to include considering its protagonist's history. The only real conceivable politically taut reason for why this film was even released before the end of Bush's time as president is that to avoid anyone else making a biopic of Bush in case they might have had the kind of daft one sided sense to portray George W. Bush as a hero and his enemies as scum Oliver Stone jumped at making the film in an act that sort of resembles suppressing an explosion.Verdict Stone's telling of George W. Bush's life is long but thin however it doesn't have any huge bias leaving it as an empty and boring chronicle with little harm.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie at my friend's insistence and watching it while drinking a beer seemed more fun than sitting at home. In retrospect only the beer was worth my time. Not that it's an irredeemably bad film... some of the sections depicting George Bush's early life are interesting and the whole thing is technically well done. But when the film gets into his presidency we're treated to impersonations rather than performances.W Josh Brolin is the prodigal son of the wealthy and influential Bush family and the film depicts a series of unfocused episodes or vignettes that led up to his assuming the presidency of the United States. Bush is depicted probably correctly as a man virtually without intellectual curiosity. His family life is left very much untouched outside of his relationship to wife Laura perhaps out of respect for the Bush children who after all did not ask for such scrutiny. I did enjoy the aspects of the story that touched on his relationship with his father President George Bush James Cromwell. Nothing else in the film had much interest or gave us much information outside of what's readily available.I think it was a mistake for Oliver Stone to make this film during Bush's presidency when there is no fresh perspective and when audiences are already so used to seeing the man on TV that attending the theater to see him represented seems pointless. And it not only seems pointless but in Oliver Stone's rambling and unfocused film it actually is pointless in my opinion. What's the idea behind this film anyway? George W. Bush is a human being. Wow give the man a cookie. It might be interesting to people decades from now but at this point everything in the film is common knowledge and a lot of the things you see in the film you might as well just watch the original footage on youtube. There are also a lot of jarring performances  Thandie Newton's take on Condoleeza Rice comes off as cartoonish and silly and yet Jeffrey Wright's take on Colin Powell seems nothing like the man we've known in public service for decades. It's as if half the performers thought they were doing a reenactment while the other half were being directed to play it broad from the hip.Oliver Stone deserves the blame for this stinker. I simply cannot fathom why he's considered by so many to be a good director. He had some talent as a screenwriter but his whole task as director seems to be to produce glossy postcards of history that probably never happened. He's like a Cecil B DeMille for our times. Not that I doubt the overall points that the film makes about our 43rd president but more I wonder why anyone feels the need to make them at this point. The film does not address any of the worst aspects of Bush's career in the presidency and lets him off the hook by portraying him as a mere incompetent who was persuaded by Rove and Cheney Richard Dreyfuss to be a devil's accomplice. Real history must be more complicated than whatever happens in Oliver Stone's head. This film is afraid to step on anyone's toes so it ends up being dull. It should have gone one way or the other  courted controversy by depicting Bush as a kind of hero or villain. Instead we get a very tepid representation of him as a wellmeaning loser. Whether it's close to reality or not should be for historians and true political observers to say but I don't see much point in basing a film on such a middle of the road interpretation.".

Although some critics apparently wanted the average TVMoviemuck type of performance where the actress finds the lighter side of the real life person Newton and Stone smartly resist that trite nonsense.Newton transcends her own glamorous persona and gives a hardasnails imitation of Rice as a person that is smart enough to understand and follow those that actually have the power in the Bush White House as she helps them manipulate Bush to acquiesce to their desires.Newton's performance successfully evokes images of the Rice that recently went to Russia and had the nerve to coolly and robotically lecture Putin on why it's OK for the U.S. to travel half the globe to punish those who kill Americans but it's not OK for Russia to go over its border to punish those that kill Russian citizens.It's one of the gutsier performances all year by anyone male or female and it really helps make the movie great.As I stated at the beginning W. is great and we finally get a movie that appeals to those of us that don't want to waste 10 bucks on a film about a Hollywood Chihuahua.".

There are many gaps in the story and I'm certain that there was a reason for that.W. wasn't meant to be a political piece but instead a character piece about a man that normally would have been quite forgettable...but as president would create many enduring memories globally.I gave it 8 out of 10 for the acting and the story...all of which has been said before so I feel no need to repeat it.".

This is probably the most pathetic version of the Bush legacy I have ever seen..It saddens me that a great director like Oliver Stone has sunk to the level of Michael Moore and made such a crap movie solely to get his own political agenda out!! What about making some propaganda films about his beloved Democrats who truly were spoon fed life like Al I created the internet Gore or dare I say ANY of his beloved Kennedys!! You will never see this due to the fact any actor in Hollywood would never get another job for slamming Demi's. As far as the acting while I thought all performances were not even close to the reality I think Newtons portrayal of Condi Rice should offend anyone Left or Right...Stone took one the most powerfulintelligent and articulate women of are day and made her into nothing short of a clown character and yes women to Bush. So to close I wish all reading this that you will take any movie coming out of Hollywood with a grain of salt and see these movies for what they truly are....COMEDY!! P.S. It's easy to be a republican when almost ALL of Hollywood has a difference of opinion when it comes to my political views due to the fact they do not live in our reality anyway!!

Oliver Stone doesn't deserve making any more money by you renting his movie. I am not an American and I also never was a fan of Bush jr. or senior. But I rented that movie because of some of the misleading comments on IMDb which shows how gullible I can be I know. I lived for 30 years in Europe and now reside in Canada and you can take my word for it when I state the fact that most people outside of the U.S. think the Americans as an arrogant and ignorant bunch of bible wielding Joe sixpacks. And many of the comments on this forum only prove it. George W. is not a moron that's just how he came across. He graduated from Yale and passed the exam to get into Harvard Business so how stupid can he possibly be. But Mr. Stone portrays him as such because he is riding the antiBush wave. He is cashing in on the fact that many people have a low opinion about their former president and he is using Michael Moore tactics by aiming low. And be it as it may my main criticism with this movie is would Oliver also make a movie about Mr. Clinton and portray him as a lying cheating warmongering cunning unethical and greedy nonindividual? Of course not so where is the artistic integrity? Because Clinton belongs to a group of politicians Oliver Stone obviously relates to. And if this political colouring leaks through a movie the director is bad. I don't care what Stone votes when the elections come so why does he need to tell me. Mr. Stone should concentrate on making documentaries but he is not of the caliber of a Werner Herzog Hell they are not even in the same league. Stone is like Moore with maybe a tad more talent. But the talent is waning. And I follow up with an apology to anybody who feels offended by certain comments I made I am not antiAmerican. To conclude my opinion about Oliver Stone he is a very biased film maker that lacks the skill of a Tom Tykwer Martin Scorcese Coppola or even Sam Peckingpah. And when it comes to bias I have similar issues with Lars von Trier who started out as a promising talent and now only demonstrates what a racist he really is. And emotions like that are better kept in and not transmitted onto the screen. Whatever happened with the director that made a movie like UTurn?".

Unfortunately the movie does not extend past 2003 and most of the screen time is given to his earlier life and his lovehate relationship with his father. Easily the most interesting scenes in the movie are the ones with him and his Cabinet. One significant flaw in the movie is the casting particularly the ones for Dick Cheney Colin Powell and George Bush Sr. who either do not have the proper voice the former two or bear any physical resemblance the latter. Josh Brolin's performance in this movie is one of the best things about this movie and he should deserve an Oscar nod as he should have gotten for his outstanding performance in the Coen Brother's masterpiece No Country For Old Men. This movie could have been better had Stone waited for the real Bush to complete his presidency and then painted a complete portrait of his Presidency instead of just the first 3 years and if he had changed some of the cast around. The fatherson relationship is interesting but becomes redundant. The writing acting and craftsmanship are impressive however. 8 out of 10.".

Now I understand why this film was released right before election time now I work at a movie theater and everyone who came out of the theater said they felt bad for W. and a couple of my friends who I saw the film said they also felt bad for him... how about us?! OK before I start banging my head up against the wall again so Oliver Stone is the critical director who decided to take on this wonderful project. The film is actually well made Josh Brolin does a decent job of portraying our constant dumbfounded president the story is pretty sad when you think about all the pressures he must face on a daily basis.Based on George W. Bush's life we go from when he was just a crazy party animal in college. Dubbed as the black sheep of the family that his brother would be more suited as president facing constant criticism from his father George Bush Sr. who was also our president for a short time. We explore W.'s life with his family his presidency the pressure he faces and the Iraq war. We also go into his world of having to pull himself out of his rut with his family who constantly puts him down with a country who is not exactly proud of him as well.W. is a good film it's well acted and put together however my main complaint but I think there is a reason why is that Oliver completely skips the election controversy we faced in 2000 as well as 911 which I thought was an important subject to touch. But I have a feeling why he didn't bring it up is due to how hard those times were for him and wasn't exactly sure how to go at it. Over all this is a watchable movie but for me it is forgettable I don't know if it will be considered a classic down the line but I guess we'll find out if our future kids are watching it in their history classes and asking us what were you on when you voted for this guy?.610".

	schema:reviewBody "After watching Stone's latest biopic I feel like I have lived through George Bush's life. No I have no new understanding of the man's life I just feel like I waisted 40 years of my own life all in the matter of 2 hours. This movie adds a whole new meaning to boring. This movie managed to show us every aspect of George's life besides those that might be interesting. We got to see some girl friend??? of George's step on a cob of corn. Why?? Is there some symbolism here. We get to see George be out Texased by some Democratic rival for state senate but when he is going to make his out Texasing comeback against the Governor of Texas we are just informed he won. Why not show it? But by far the worst two things about this movie have got to be the actress representing Condilice Rice and the choice of background music. First Condi. I am not a big fan of the woman but my god what was the decision to present her as a mentally challenged freak with facial ticks. And why does she act more like George's secretary than a deputy of the NSA and then future Secretary of State. I do not know who the actress was as of yet but I can guarantee you that I will never watch another movie that she is in ever again. She alone made me hate this movie more anything else in any other previous movie. Now the music. Stone should know better. The sappy crap music reminded me of the dramatic under filler for the series Jericho. It was the music that destroyed the whole series of Jericho. And for all you peanut lovers out there I can care less about your peanuts. I am glad Jericho was canceled.".

	schema:reviewBody "W.  Oliver Stone's W. is an oddity. There's no other word for it. In attempting to provide psychological commentary on the presidency of George W. Bush it forgets the simple cinematic basics of story structure and character. The tone of the film is nearly non existent leaving its admirable cast of actors on shaky ground without a leg to stand on.Stone juxtaposes the rise of Dubya played by Josh Brolin with his decision to begin the current Iraq War. In displaying Bush's journey from frat boy to drunk to born again AA member to leader of the free world Stone has enough material to create a wicked absurdist satire or compelling political theater. However Stone seems hellbent on making a film that remains neutral toward the forty third President giving him the ability to say things like It will contain surprises for Bush supporters and his detractors. Well yes I was surprised indeed. Surprised that the man who's made films as vibrant and lively as JFK and Natural Born Killers as somber and emotional as Platoon or Born on the Fourth of July has rendered this film completely dull and lifeless.Perhaps Stone isn't completely to blame. Stanley Weiser's script bland and talky in the worst possible way contains figures instead of characters and when put into scenes these figure say exactly what should be shown in outlets other than dialog removing any hope for subtlety.I do know this the film's failure is certainly not the fault of the cast which includes actors as esteemed as Richard Dreyfuss and Ellen Burstyn. By and large with the exception of Thandie Newton's dreadful aping of Condoleezza Rice the cast excels at inhabiting the situation. This is especially true for Brolin who's performance is so complete and convincing that it overshadows the entire film and underlines the numerous flaws. Beyond physical inhabitation and imitation Brolin's performance shows a deep understanding of Dubya as a man I wish I could say the same about the film.".

Each would be relatively harmless as clerks who amuse at lunch breaks but these are men whose inadequacies break worlds.It is no wonder that this portrays Bush respectfully. No wonder that it is all about intent the man is a good honest unselfish man whose only weakness was a vision of an unrealistic utopia and the accident of being surrounded by fools and devils. I believe that all of Stone's projects are autobiographical and he impresses on them his own story. Its Woody Allen except instead of placing himself in the cosmic forces of personal relationships and self he wanders among what he sees is a cosmos of global conspiracy. That he is able to make a living in Hollywood is I think because our notions of noir are close enough to this so that he and Spike Lee can bloviate and make a living.As time goes on he worries more and more about himself so he makes his heroes basically good men lost. But this time history bucks him. The culpability of this man cannot be explained away by blaming Rove and Cheney. His qualms about torture are known to not have happened. We know that he pushed for policies that will be evaluated in time as war crimes. Now he may have done that with noble intent but more ruthless and scheming than this golden Rube we see here.This is a disaster for history. Because so few Americans read books instead getting their history from films and blogmobs. The cinematic values of Stone's prior work are not even visible. The energy of Platoon the craft of JFK are gone. We have normal TeeVee movie framing here.I think we should vote Stone out.Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.".

A sequel to Heidi the beloved classic that makes many people think of Shirley Temple it tells the story of a teenage Heidi who is sent to boarding school in Italy during World War One. But circumstances force Heidi and her new school friends to embark on a dangerous journey through the warring countryside bound for the mountain that will take them safely to Heidi's homeland of Switzerland.One of the prime delights in this movie is the splendid scenery with sweeping views of the Alps from all sorts of different angles. As for the movie itself it has a compelling enough plot and one certainly appealing to the family audience courageous children fighting against all odds to find freedom during troubling times. The characters are interesting and somewhat Dickensian though at times you feel like we move to the next scene before we've had a chance to really get to know any of them. Fortunately most of the cast is excellent especially 15yearold Juliette Caton who plays Heidi and the other four girls who are these wonderful actresses and why didn't we see them again after this movie?. Leslie Caron remember An American in Paris? is nice as the warmhearted headmistress and Jan Rubes is the perfect Grandfather. And three cheers for another marvelous but relatively unknown actor Yorgo Voyagis perhaps most widely seen as Jospeh in the epic miniseries Jesus of Nazareth who plays the villainous factory owner to wicked perfection.The only actor who is completely out of place is the actor who gets his name at the front of the credits Charlie Sheen. Perhaps it's the fact that he doesn't even try to hide his American accent or perhaps it's because he is playing an 18yearold when he is actually in his midtwenties at the time. Or perhaps it is an attempt to have a star so that the movie will be easier to promote a device that never works.Surprisingly enough Mr. Sheen is not in the movie very much. And everything else is really a worthwhile adventure for the entire family without any pesky offcolor jokes and bad language a rarity in family movies these days. And be sure to listen to the music. It's just as majestic as the mountains.".

I had never watched Heidi before so really had no experience with the Heidi story. This movie could not have been a better introduction and I have never wanted to watch another Heidi version since. I love this movie and we have a family tradition of watching it every Christmas. I also pull it out of the vault and watch it at ANY time of the year because I love it so much.This movie not only has beautiful shots and scenery in it but shows that a young woman or any woman for that matter can be beautiful being her natural self. Heidi is gorgeous naturally beautiful without artifice and very self confident and sure of herself. She lives her life simply and doesn't know any other way and even when she finds out that her lifestyle is considered old fashioned she doesn't let it get her down.The story line in this movie is simple yet tugs at the heart strings. There is adventure the awkwardness of new experiences the buddings of first love new friends to be made and challenges to be overcome all the while amidst the back drop of snowy caped mountains and rustic villages.If you are a fan of period romances westerns frontier type movies or just a simple romantic at heart then I would give this movie a try. You might be surprised that hidden underneath that unassuming title and DVD graphics is a true gem.Ohh..did I mention TOTALLY kid friendly and morally appropriate!!!".

	schema:headline " Oliver Twist meets the Great Escape";
	schema:reviewBody "There are some slight spoilers but I'm not going to give away any finer details. I guess there are a lot of down points to this film. Miscasting revisionist literature et cetera. But despite all this Courage Mountain is still a rather entertaining movie.A sequel to Heidi one of the world's most beloved children's books our protagonist finds herself with a large inheritance. So Grandfather sends her to an elite school for girls where she can learn to fend for herself like any rich girl.She travels to Italy and spends only a short time in the school when World War One breaks out. The Italian Army commandeers the school and the children including Heidi whose parents could not be reached are shipped to an orphanage where they are forced to do hard labor.The orphanage is run by a sinister man a really evil version of Mr. Bumbles from Oliver! who works the poor children to death. Literally.Then they plan to escape across the Alps to Switzerland to Heidi's Grandfather. But to complicate their plans the orphanage owner persues them across wartorn Italy with the sole intention of killing them.Sounds reasonably good? Well it is. Despite the occasional miscast like Charlie Sheen as Peter Heidi's love there is good acting now and then especially from Juliette Caton who plays Heidi. There's also the good production design and cinematography. Courage Mountain also has the feel of adventure a sense of urgency.It's not perfect as mentioned. The movie has the feeling that it had been longer and better written but that it has been cut to make it more KiddyFriendly. Scenes pass too quickly for the acting to be engrossing. Detail has been given to the narrative yet the human element character development has been left out.Ultimately it is the Great Escape for children with elements from Oliver Twist and Heidi thrown in to create a movie which despite being somewhat watchable could have been great!I give it a 7 out of 10. It should really get a 5 but I added two points for effort. Not all my agree especially if your picky with my score but face it it could have been worse and there worse movies out there.".

It is just too farfetched with usually mediocre acting that's child actors for you though usually mediocre.The heart in this story is it's driving force. It's about love and survival Heidi's love for well nearly everyone the children's love for each other and more.Although the cover and title may not seem very promising it is worth watching.

	schema:headline " Beautiful scenery simple family fair enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours";
	schema:reviewBody "Never heard of this movie till popped up as the midday movie today. Definitely has that Swiss alp feel nice girl power story line with the mandatory villain the town's orphanage owner played by suitable scary Yorgo Voyagis. Leslie Caron is very good and well cast as the school mistress. Grandfather played by Jan Rubes is very believable and portrays the perfect Heidi grandfather. The time setting of WWI helps by providing the background story helping the movie move along at a suitable pace. Juliette Caton in the lead role as Heidi does a good job with Charlie Sheen who does a good job when cast as Heidi's little bit older boyfriend whilst he does not have a big role I think it would probably have been a little bit inappropriate if he had more to do in the film as he was in his mid 20's when the film was shot Charlie's character manages to save the day and all ends in smiles. Others have given a more indepth dissection of the plot but I will finish now by saying watching Courage Mountain would be a good way to spend a couple of hours with the family on a wet overcast or cold day.".
