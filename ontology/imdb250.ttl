On a whim Steve proposes marriage to Mary while acknowledging that their hearts will always belong to others. They decide their marriage will be based on their friendship alone and each will be free to walk away at any time with no regrets.It is of course inevitable that the original sweethearts will each turn up and test Steve and Mary's resolve. But what is most striking to me is that midway through their marriage Mary gives birth to a baby girl. Yes of course this film was made preCode but nonetheless it's remarkable that it would be acknowledged that these friends in a marriage of nothing but convenience would have a sexual relationship as well. The pregnancy and birth aren't even a very big deal and Mary's and Steve's open marriage agreement continues. There is even a suggestion that the existence of the child should be no impediment to either of the spouses' decision to go his or her own way.Of course there's a happy ending so the point is made moot.

A blond Myrna Loy looks alluring enough but not when she's reduced to fluttering her eyes and mouthing sappy lines like Oh darling look at this glorious night it was made for us to a champion of the Catholic guilt complex. Director John Sloane does little to inspire his actors who morosely deliver their lines in two shot filled with pregnant pauses and embarrassed looks. Sloane manages to zap the energy out of nearly every shot while his clumsy cuts from scene to scene plays havoc with time and place. If there is any consolation to Consolation Marriage it is that Ms. Dunne at times rises above the material and Pat's anemic passion to project an effective and ideal portrait of a modern woman in turmoil. Thing is she does it just as well in better pictures.".

Director John Sloane does little to inspire his actors who morosely deliver their lines in two shot filled with pregnant pauses and embarrassed looks. Sloane manages to zap the energy out of nearly every shot while his clumsy cuts from scene to scene plays havoc with time and place. If there is any consolation to Consolation Marriage it is that Ms. Dunne at times rises above the material and Pat's anemic passion to project an effective and ideal portrait of a modern woman in turmoil. Thing is she does it just as well in better pictures.";

	schema:reviewBody "The socalled PreCode films were made up to about 1935 and were called this because although Hollywood DID have a long list of standards they were pretty much ignored until an updated Production Code was adopted. These PreCode films were some times VERY racy and not at all what the average person these days thinks these early films were like as some included nudity foul language racy topics and violence! While CONSOLATION MARRIAGE was made in this era and has SOME elements that would not have been allowed had it been made just a few years later it is a relatively benign filmwith no nudity or violence. Instead its main plot line would NOT have been acceptable as it concerns a marriage of convenience that is essentially an open marriage. If either partner became dissatisfied or found someone else then they both agreed the marriage was over and it was okay to leave! This rather selfish or amoral view of marriage NEVER would have appeared in films during the next several decades! This strange marriage contract it seems resulted from BOTH Pat O'Brien and Irene Dunne being dumped by their respective fiancs. So out of loneliness they were drawn togetherat least until something better came along! And later BOTH Dunne's and O'Brien's old flames return and want them! And at this point the couple have a choice to makeleave or stick around. This is further complicated by the fact that they now have a baby! How this whole thing is sorted out is despite it being PreCode rather conventional and predictableas well as overly long and a tad dull. That's because this type of plot was believe it or not often copied! I have seen several very similar movies involving open marriages in the early 1930s and in each case the film ends EXACTLY where you'd expect. Because of this derivative nature it is a very skipable filmespecially if you've seen others like it.FYIIt's interesting to see that in this film Myrna Loy is a blonde!".

This is old in that it's melodramatic and irrelevant and dated.Consolation Marriage is from 1931 and stars Irene Dunne Pat O'Brien Myrna Loy John Halliday and Lester Vail. Dunne is Mary Brown Porter who loses her childhood sweetheart Aubrey Lester Vail to a rich woman. Mary tends to be a fairly understanding woman. Or else she's masochistic.She meets Steve Porter O'Brien another jiltee and they decide to get married even though they aren't in love. There's an understanding that Steve is still in love with the girl of his dreams Elaine Myrna Loy but they keep breaking up. Mary again goes along with this arrangement.When I saw that Myrna Loy was supposed to be playing the other woman I thought it was a mistake when I saw her. She did not look remotely like herself. Later I realized it was indeed Loy who made a dazzling blond beautifully gowned and coiffed.Steve and Mary get a dog and have a baby but Steve slips away often to be involved with Elaine. Then Mary gets her big chance with Jeff John Halliday. Will she take it? And will Steve ever leave her for Elaine?It's the rare woman who has the other woman over to her house and helps her dress. This is a movie about class distinction a big topic in the old days so it has a certain formality found in the theater and film before the Depression brought in the working man playwrights. I always liked Pat O'Brien but I've never quite understood why he was used as a leading man in these romantic movies. Comedy certainly. But unlike the other character actors who became leads  Bogart Robinson Cagney etc.  O'Brien was not as successful. Irene Dunne is lovely in a difficult role that of a woman being walked all over putting up with it and keeping her dignity.John Halliday refers to himself as an old man and I thought to myself I'll bet he's 40  you know how differently age was perceived in those days. Turned out he was 50.This is one of Dunne's first films and if you're a huge fan you may want to see it. I don't recommend it. At around 90 minutes it seems like it's four hours long.".

It makes the movie seem very very long although it's actually only 81 minutes long.The premise of the film is actually interesting. A man Pat O'Brien and a woman Irene Dunne each break up with the loves of their lives for the man it's Myrna Loy. They then have a chance meeting in a barrestaurant. They don't exactly fall in love...it's more a relationship of convenience...better to be together than alone. They marry with the understanding that if their true loves return they're each free to make their own decision. A child is born. And then at the same time the old lovers do return. Dunne leaves her baby and heads off with her lover Lester Vail. But within hours realizes she loves not only her baby but also Pat O'Brien. She returns home to find that O'Brien is going to meet Loy but instead she suggests bringing her to the house. Which O'Brien does and that leads to a very awkward scene where Dunne attempts to keep a stiff upper lip and be very modern about what is happening...but ultimately breaks down in tears.Strikes against each character. Vail and Loy for horning in on a marriage...doubly so for Loy because she is such a cold woman here. Strikes against Dunne for being willing to give up her baby and husband...at least for a while. Strikes against O'Brien for bringing the other woman to his home to meet his wife.The actors play their roles relatively well it's just that it's difficult to really like any of the characters very much. Each of the characters is remarkably callous at various times and there's no clear good or bad guys and gals here. I did enjoy supporting actor John Halliday The movie is worth wading through if you like really old movies though you won't want to wade through it more than once and I doubt you'll want this clunker on your DVD shelf.".

John Terlesky isn't the musclebound hulk that Rick Hill was and certainly not the musclebound hulk in the Boris Vallejo painting they used for the poster but he doesn't have to be. This is a Deathstalker who knows perfectly well that he's in a campy Bgrade swordandsorcery flick and is determined to have as much fun with it as he can. He takes nothing seriously and almost everything is done with a wink at the audience. He wonders aloud at one point where the cliche Spikey Trap O'Death is and when the spikes immediately pop out of the walls he just rolls his eyes says Son of a bitch! and deals with it.John Lazar as the villain Jarek knows it too. He's gleefully manaically evil but when he learns his adversary's moniker he can barely suppress the giggle as he repeats incredulously Deathstalker?!Monique Gabrielle takes her parts seriously and it's just as well. She's the one who's always in need of a rescue and I suppose that someone has to put up a show of genuine peril. She also fills out admirably the part that's absolutely essential in films of this quality she supplies the main set of onscreen boobs. It wouldn't be a proper Bgrade swordandsorcery flick without them.Sit back have a beer or 5 and enjoy Deathstalker II. Laugh you're supposed to. And stick around through the end credits for the outtakes. Those are funny too.".

	schema:reviewBody "Deathstalker II is the presumed followup to 1982's lowbudget Deathstalker. Aside from the title it's hard to consider this film a sequel. In fact this film is so much more enjoyable than the first or the third or fourth for that matter that such a statement is probably a good thing!The film begins with Deathstalker John Terlesky infiltrating what appears to be a treasure room in a dark castle.  He sneaks up to an altar upon which rests some form of crystal artifact and in a scene that recalls either Raiders of the Lost Ark or Conan the Barbarian no really! gingerly takes it from its place of honor and pockets it. Without warning a legion of robeenshrouded swordsmen rush in and Deathstalker battles them off in truly heroic fashion.well somewhat heroic fashion. After dispatching a few of these menacing thugs Deathstalker breaks through a shuttered window drops to a stone bridge below and leaps to the back of his waiting horse before escaping into the night. In his wake a scantily dressed warrior woman named Sultana Toni Naples steps to the window from which he made his daring escape and watches him vanish into the darkness. Without missing a beat she turns to her remaining guards and vows I'll have my revenge and Deathstalker too!at which point the title card Deathstalker II comes up with a fiery background and a Morriconeesque theme fully setting the style for this bgrade but surprisingly entertaining swordandsorcery epic.In his travels our hero encounters a lovely young woman who claims to be the wrongfully dethroned Princess Evie former Penthouse Pet Monique Gabrielle. She implores him to aid her on her journey to reclaim her kingdom and overthrow the villainous wizard Jerak who has used his skill at the black arts to create Princess Evie's evil duplicate MirrorUniverse Monique Gabrielle. With the promise of fortune and fame thrown in his lap Deathstalker accepts the task and the adventure begins in earnest.Along the way the adventuring duo battle swarthy castle guards undead zombies sinister traps amazon women warriors an insidious pirate and his team of enforcers the wicked Sultana and numerous other hardships before finally reaching the castle and engaging in mortal combat with Jerak and Evil Evie. Who wins? Well that would be telling but suffice it to say that this is a quest that is certainly worth the 7885 minutesdepending on which version you getspent watching it.Filmed on a budget of apparently tens of dollars Deathstalker II is rife with highquality costumes props and sets. Beautifully adorned styrofoam rock walls can be spotted in the opening scene as well as in the following tavern sequence which also clearly features a poured concrete floor and fluorescent lighting in addition to numerous wooden barrels marked BEER!!! The ominous woods are made even more ominous with the generous use of a fog machine and wellconcealed klieg lights streaming from between the trunks and branches of the trees. Colored light gels and inspired location shooting provide unique ambience for each new area and the climactic sword battle the Duel of the Titans mentioned in the title is actually very wellchoreographed and presented with a dynamic musical accompaniment. However these technical achievements are only the tip of the cinematic iceberg!The actors chosen are alltooclearly enjoying their respective roles to an enormous degree. Watch Monique's eyebrows as she gazes into her crystal doorknob and tells Stalker about the adventure he's about to undergo! Witness the unbridled amount of midget abuse that occurs throughout the film! Prepare for the Gladiatorlike battle between Stalker and Gargo the Amazon!  And be sure to spot the Fiat parked in the upperleft corner of the Amazon village scene!If you're in the mood for an unpretentious swordandsorcery adventure Deathstalker II is your ticket. It's not Shakespeare but it is a lot of fun. Rent it tonight or better yet buy it outright! and make sure your fridge is fully stocked with brew!P.S. Don't pop this sucker out of your VCRDVD player until after you watch the outtakes over the end credits! Think of it as your reward for giving this one a chance!".

At the opening of the film Deathstalker steals a jewel from SultanaToni Naples who announces the film to the viewer after she vows revenge. Sultana will assist Jarek in a mission to kill Reena and give Evie the kingdom..Evie needs Reena dead because she's slowly fading for some reason. Anyway Deathstalker agrees to help Reena manipulated into partaking the mission at the idea of fame and fortune..not knowing he's being duped into helping Reena get her kingdom back for she has concealed her identity as the princess taking on the fortunetelling gig as a disguise. The rest of this flick has them facing all types of peril..oooo..ahhhh... including Deathstalker's wrestling match with an Amazonian female behemoth..gasp..to the death because the female tribe he and Reena were captured by condemn his womanizing ways! Maria Socas is the Queen of this tribe and yet another easyontheeyes casting choice by the filmmakers..you have to know the demographic this is aiming at eh? Deathstalker also faces other traps like one inside a mausoleum where Jarek has designed a wall of spikes coming towards him as Reena faces off with a horde of zombies. Reena hangs over a cauldron as Deathstalker has to come to her rescue while trying to defeat Sultana in a swordfight. You have a finale at the Princess' castle as the Amazonian women tribe who decide to help Deathstalker and Reena after all assist them in a fight against Jarek and his guards while Evie plans to kill her sister.Director Wynorski operates with NRNNo Restraint Necessary. This is a complete send up of the swords sandals and sorcery genre that was successful at the time. Tongue just isn't firmly in cheek..it's wagging. And as expected in a film from Jim Wynorski you get plenty of tits. Monique Gabrielle doesn't try to act and knows the film is ridiculous so she just plays along with the material as does Terlesky as the mugging hero all chiseled smiles. Neither hides the fact that they're in a silly film..this will no doubt drive some people up the wall..I can't say I'd blame them but I knew what I was getting into and the opening minutes lets you know the brand of entertainment in store for the viewer the rest of the way.. I watched this nonsense in the right frame of mind so it went over without a hitch. Naples and Socas are merely eyecandy as is Gabrielle who looks fantastic even if she's not exactly the greatest onscreen performer in the world. The very definition of a guilty pleasure..some will find it incredibly annoying but I just took it with a grain of salt and had a good time. I swear that whishing sound effects as swords move in combat sound like something out of the Masters of the Universe cartoon. Whoever choreographed those sword fighting scenes must have done it for free..and especially the bar fighting scene and cave fighting opening scenebecause they don't look that convincing to me..perhaps like the rest of the film Wynorski is winking at us that this flick isn't supposed to be convincing but pure schlock. If that was his intent constantly winking at us he succeeded.".

	schema:reviewBody "I always loved B movies that have fun and don't take themselves too seriously. Add a likable male star in John Terlesky and the beautiful former Penthouse Pet in Monique Gabrielle and you have a classic. Even though this is a B movie it has good enough special effects to get by. Probably the other most important part to make this a great movie are the two nude scenes by Monique Gabrielle! The movie starts out with the real Princess Evie being replaced by a fake. She recruits the Deathstalker to take her to the castle and reclaim her crown from Jarek the Sorcerer. She predicts their future and offers a reward if he will help her out. They battle bandits and Zombies along the way. Monique has a great line when they go to sleep for the night. She says Stalker is that your sword or are you just glad to see me. The next day they are caught by a group of women and they put him on trial by combat because he is a womanizer. He has to fight in a boxing ring and they play the Rocky Theme as he enters the ring. He has a very funny fight to the death with a huge woman. He wins and realizes Monique really is the princess. Monique plays the dual role of the princess and the fake princess. She did a great job in each role. As the fake princess she is made up and looks gorgeous. Her costumes are nice and revealing. The real princess spends her time in a brown outfit and she is not made up at all. She still looks gorgeous. Monique leaves the woman's camp when Deathstalker shows interest in the head woman. Stalker leaves when she becomes serious and comes to the rescue of Monique. They finally make it to the castle. Stalker is captured and Monique is attacked by the guards. They rip off her dress to check her heart. Monique boobs look great in this short nude scene. She was definitely hired for her body even though she does a great job of acting. Later Stalker is saved by the fake princess. She wants to have sex with him and then kill himthis is how she keeps her appearance. She has on a Leia slave girl like outfit on and then she show her two talents in an excellent scene in bed. Nice shots of her boobs! Way to go Monique it was well worth the wait. The good Monique kills the fake Monique and Stalker takes care of the Sorcerer. The final scene has Monique wearing a sexy white outfit and giving him a reward herself! What a great reward. What a really fun movie with a really nice nude scene thrown in for Monique fans. 10 out of 10!".

Deathstalker takes up the challenge but can he defeat this powerful villain and has Evie told him the whole story Okay this movie's a bit cheesy and goofball with cardboard sets and a scenechewing cast but I can't help but enjoy it a lot. Like Piranha it knows it's cashing in on the success of a better film but that doesn't stop it being witty exciting and fast paced. We get medieval barroom brawls slavegirl mud fights a tussle in a crypt with a gang of zombies a wrestling match with an Amazon a pit and pendulum torture number and a steamy vampire seduction scene. Wynorski sensibly keeps everything moving along nice as you please with the next fight joke fleshpot or scare never far away. He's a really good director with a fine eye for a shot clever timing and a complete lack of pretension check out any of his other films my favourite is Transylvania Twist. The cast are fun  Terlesky coasts on his goofy good looks as the amiable Deathstalker and Gabrielle and Naples are both saucy delights frequently in eyepopping costumes which seem to defy both gravity and human physiology. Topping it all off is a toetappingly pleasant muzak score by Chuck Cirino all kooky chords and crescendos. Bmovie afficionados and if you aren't one stop taking films so seriously will find much to enjoy in this goodnatured sexy lowbudget adventure flick. A straighttovideo movie also known as Deathstalker II Duel Of The Titans it has little connection with the more mundane 1983 movie Deathstalker and two plodding sequels Deathstalker And The Warriors From Hell and Deathstalker IV Match Of Titans.".

It seems a vampire is loose in a small German town draining its victims of their blood. Police Inspector Karl Brettschneider Melvyn Douglas in one of his early roles is skeptical believing a crazed killer not a vampire is running amok. The only one who believes him is Ruth Bertin Faye Wray the inspector's girlfriend and lab assistant to Dr. Otto von Niemann Lionel Atwill who though apparently an eminent scientist goes along with the vampire theory. The townspeople suspect the weirdo Herman Gleib played with his usual frenzy by Dwight Frye who seems to be having a lot of fun with his role. The film contains quite a bit of humor which helps relieve some of the intensity involved with all the murders being committed. One funny part has Gussie Schnappmann Maude Eburne Ruth Bertin's aunt thinking weird Herman has turned not into a bat but into a dog. Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye make a good comedy team.This budget movie brings in elements from The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari with Dr. Niemann using the power of suggestion to make a somnambulist carry out his orders from Frankenstein by using the human blood to help create life in the laboratory and Dracula since the murders are believed by everyone except the inspector and his girl to be the work of a bloodsucker. Thses elements are mixed well by director Frank R. Strayer with a little comedy thrown in for good measure. The concoction works. The restored version I viewed used tinting to increase the spooky atmosphere. So try to see the this version if possible.".

With that this is still worth everyone's time and it's a heck of a lot of fun to view and in my opinion it's better than most of what is supposed to pass nowadays as horror! Story takes place in the small German town of Klineschloss where the bodies have been piling up completely drained of blood and with suspicious puncture marks. Burgermister Gustave Schoen Lionel Belmore shouts It's Vampires but the local police chief Karl Brettschneider Melvyn Douglas thinks it's a madman who's responsible and he vows to catch him.SPOILER ALERT The Burgermeister and most of the towns folk think that the local kook Herman Glieb Dwight Frye who loves bats and frequently talks to them is the one they are looking for and they chase him until he falls to his death in a cave. The one who is responsible for the killings is Dr. Otto von Niemann Lionel Atwill who has created a new form of tissue mass that feeds on blood and he accomplishes this by having some sort of mind control over his servant Emil Robert Frazer who goes out at night to collect the blood. Dr. Otto has a pretty assistant named Ruth Bertin Fay Wray and an annoying aunt named Gussie Maude Eburne but they have no clue what he's up to but Karl eventually become suspicious when one of the murders takes place after Herman's death.Frank R. Strayer was never confused with being James Whale but he was a pretty competent director who ended up directing most of the Blondie films in that series and with this film he uses the same sets from The Old Dark House which was also filmed at Universal. I'm the first to admit that this film is downright clumsy at times but it's practically impossible to resist a film that has a cast like this including Frye who is pretty much doing his Renfield role only this time he befriends bats and strokes them and keeps them in his pocket for safe keeping! One thing that just doesn't make sense is the mind control that Dr. Otto has over Emil as the film never explains this and I had a strong sense that this was some sort of nod to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari but on the other hand it's probably just the weakest part of the script. There are a few other tidbits that I noticed including the chase of Frye to the big caves which is obviously an early shot of the infamous Bronson Canyon where numerous other films have been made and also Wray's brown hair which is her true color. True horror film fans will appreciate this more than others but I think this is a fun film to view for everyone and with a cast as attractive as this it's well worth a look.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Vampire Bat starts out fabulously with eerie images of large bats fluttering through the dark night and a very atmospheric portrayal of a petrified little town with its superstitious inhabitants under the spell of a serial killer who seemly drains all the blood out of hisher victims' bodies. The opening sequences of this film the first 15 minutes or so is pure vintage horror with a suspenseful introduction to the story extended speeches with a detailed description of the killer's modus operandi and a great use of set pieces and interiors that already proved their effectiveness earlier the same scenery was used in Universal classics like The Old Dark House for example. Very regrettable however is that the story quickly becomes tedious and predictable and the only element left to admire near the end is the sublime acting by a multitalented cast. In the remote town of Kleinschloss very cool name by the way they keep on finding bodies with not a single drop of blood left in them. The scared and superstitious villagers are convinced that there's a vampire in their midst it wouldn't be the first time according to the history books and the prime suspect is the villageidiot Hermann who shows a bizarre affection towards bats. The only straightthinking authority figure is inspector Karl Brettschneider but even he can't come up with a rational explanation for the murders. If you're somewhat familiar with the roles and careers of eminent horror actors in the 30's you know who the real culprit is right away and  even if you're not  it's not hard to guess since the clues are numberless. The Vampire Bat isn't a very efficient whodunit mystery but it definitely remains a must for fans of classic horror films since it brings together names like Fay Wray immortal for her role in King Kong Lionel Atwill Mystery of the Wax Museum Melvyn Douglas Polanski's The Tenant and Dwight Fry. This latter is my personal favorite cast member here mainly because he's a very underrated actor who always stood in the shadows of more important horror veterans. His performance of Herman the nut is truly terrific.".

I won't go into the details of the plot as that has been covered multiple times in other reviews and it's not the story that makes the film shine.There are three things that make The Vampire Bat stand out from the other poverty row films  the cast the direction and the comedy.The Cast  Lionel Atwill Melvyn Douglas and Fay Wray get the heavy lifting in the film and all are excellent. Atwill is perfect for this type of part as he demonstrated many times. Douglas is sufficiently perplexed as the investigator and Fay Wray is just gorgeous in distress. The other players add sufficiently especially Dwight Frye channeling a dimmer version of Renfield from Dracula.The Direction  Frank Strayer does an admirable job in shooting the film with creepiness abundant and lots of camera movement. Some shots are just so outstanding such as the opening scene that they almost seem out of place in a cheap horror movie. Strayer provides loads of atmosphere and never loses the audience. An excellent job.The Comedy  As with most horror films of this time comedy relief was thrown in to lighten the mood of the audience and in most films the comedy was misplaced and terribly unfunny. However in The Vampire Bat the comedy mostly provided by Maude Eburne as Aunt Gussie is spot on and still funny today. This helps to keep the film watchable.The Downsides  There is really only a couple of downsides to the film. The first is the editing which is clumsy and hurried. It sometimes spoils the excellent direction. Cuts are often not matched and this can distract. Obviously this was not a big budget film so the sets and overall production values are not high but this is mostly glossed over by the efficiency and care shown by the director but there are a few scenes where the seams showed too much like the cave scene parts of which look like it was filmed in a closet.Overall The Vampire Bat is certainly worth a look for the great direction a mad Lionel Atwill and the always lovely Fay Wray.".

It is better than most independent pictures of this type and compares favorably with productions being produced by Universal at the same time. The settings and atmosphere are as good as any displayed in the latter's more expensive productions. The story is about a small German village whose citizens are turning up dead drained of their blood and showing the familiar two telltale puncture wounds on their necks suggesting the work of a vampire. Who is behind these sinister actions? The townfolk led by police chief Melvyn Douglas suspect the dimwitted Herman Dwight Frye. Respectable doctor Lionel Atwill and his assistant Fay Wray are among the concerned citizens. Herman is driven to his death however the killings continue. So who really is to blame?  It's not to hard to figure out who is behind the killings. The suspense builds nicely in the first half of the film only to be let down by the uninspired ending and resolution of the mystery. The reason for all of the killings although explained is not really explored in any detail i.e. no monsters or the like. The dispatching of the villain is done off screen and as a result the viewer feels cheated.  For all of its faults The Vampire Bat is still an enjoyable little film if for no other reason than to enjoy Melvyn Douglas in an early preMGM role and Fay Wray just before she found her 15 minutes of fame in King Kong the same year.".

Burgermeister Gustave Schoen Lionel Belmore and police chief Karl Brettschneider Melvyn Douglas are at a loss as to explain what's going on though hints of a vampire at work seem to be on everyone's mind. It looks like the fall guy will be the mentally challenged Herman Glieb Dwight Frye who admits to keeping bats as pets and playing with them.What's really going on is that the good doctor Otto Von Niemann Lionell Atwill in his quest to create life a la Frankenstein has developed a mass of living tissue that needs human blood to sustain itself. His creation laughably resembles not much more than a large sponge in a lab jar not very horrific and certainly not very threatening. Von Niemann has an unexplained telepathic link to an assistant named Emil who does the doctor's bidding in providing a reliable blood supply complete with the signature dual puncture marks on the throat of the victims.Before it's all over a posse of citizens chases down the pitiful Herman who jumps to his death in a mountain cavern known as Devil's Well rather than allow himself to be captured. Dwight Frye created quite the niche for himself with knock offs of the Renfield character he portrayed in the original 1931 film Dracula. In this one he's particularly effective complete with crazed look as he fondly strokes one of his many furry bat friends.Fay Wray is on hand as romantic interest Ruth Bertin for police chief Karl just a few short months away from the release of the film that forever defined her signature role as the love interest for King Kong. She also teamed up with Lionel Atwill a couple more times in 1932's Doctor X and Mystery of the Wax Museum which closely followed The Vampire Bat.In the film's finale Von Niemann attempts to pin the bat murders on his assistant Emil but Emil turns the tables on his mentor with both antagonists meeting their end to the sound of gunshots off screen. Shortly after in a priceless scene hypochondriac Aunt Gussie frantically comes calling for the doctor complaining of symptoms she's suffering from the doctor's prescription of hydrous magnesium sulfate. Calling a spade a spade Karl and Ruth share a laugh as the Epsom salts the doctor provided have Aunt Gussie on the run.If by the end of this film you haven't yet had your fill of the bat genre drive yourself even more batty with Bela Lugosi's 1940 entry The Devil Bat or Vincent Price's 1959 horror mystery The Bat.

NOt much happens for a long time but then we discover that Atwill's pipe smoking doctor is the real murderer. There is too much 'comic relief' but that is par for the course for this era. Fay Wray looks really good.";

	schema:reviewBody "Last night we watched 'The Vampire Bat' on Amazon Prime. It's a 64 minute 1933 film featuring Fay Wray Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye. This was another of those wonderful 1930s horror films I enjoy so much...there is so much magic in these old BW films I can't get enough of them. The story was a mystery with an interesting twist on what was happening. Is it a vampire committing the murders or a man ? All we know is there are strange marks on the victim's necks and all their blood has been drained out. We have to wait to find out why and how ? Vampire or man either way the viewer will not be disappointed by the weird finale. IMO It's not as good as two other horror films with Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray from the same time period 'Doctor X' and 'Mystery of the Wax Museum' still it's fun and well worth watching for sure. About my only complaint is Amazon had a pretty mediocre copy lots of scratches in the print and the sound quality was hardly understandable at times. I hope someday someone does a full restoration on this film if they haven't already done so.".

Everyone is in a tizzy because no one can seem to figure this out. They lock their door close their windows do all the right things but the killing goes on. Crosses and other anti vampire paraphernalia don't seem to work. That's because there's more to it than meets the eye. As long as it was truly a vampire story it worked. When other elements enter in it starts to fall apart if one does the least bit of thinking. Since seeing Dracula I've enjoyed watching any appearance of Dwight Frye. He is the consummate scene stealer. The poor guy here comes and goes among the gentry with bats in his pockets staring with those sunken eyes. Considering people are terrified of bats and suspect him already these are not the wisest of moves.The whole premise for this set of events is never made totally clear. The blood of the victims is needed and so old Lionel Atwill springs into action. There seemed to be a few of the distinguished actors whose careers seemed to bank on the horror genre. He plays his part well. He also has his assistant. Who is this guy and why is he willing to work so hard of course there's a secret. The film has its moments and it's not bad for this type of film but it could have rivaled some of the better ones by banking a little more on the supernatural.".

Here we have a movie taking elements from the earlier 'Dracula' 1931 and 'Frankenstein' 1931  in a Germanic town the village leaders believe that vampires in the shape of bats have been the cause of recent deaths of bloodless victims. Even though shot at Universal and at the Bronson caves! it's a Poverty Row feature it's not fair to compare it with those earlier more expensively made and superior films.From the familiar and exciting chilling music of the main titles which must have been by Mischa Bakalienikoff through the talky but well done opening sequence we anticipate the arrival of Lionel Atwill Fay Wray and Dwight Frye to give us a good 30s mystery film. Unfortunately it doesn't happen. That's the disappointment.We get little more than the formulaic elements of such films but with slow pacing low budget not enough of Dwight Frye the overdone presence of Maude Eburne Aunt Gussie and the premise for Lionel Atwill Dr. von Niemann to require human blood or how he exhibits mind control over his servant Emil Robert Frazier never made very clear.Do not watch the technicolor 'Dr. X' 1932  which also stars Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray but as father and daughter  before watching this the way I did it's an Oscar winner by comparison. So watch this one first. Structurally 'The Vampire Bat' still isn't that good. It plods along with too much talking or unnecessary comic relief without focusing strongly on the vampiric villainy.Besides 'Dr. X' and 'Mystery of the Wax Museum' both 1932 and co starring Fay Wray Lionel Atwill's most famous appearances are as the one armed gendarme in 'Son of Frankenstein' 1939 and as Moriarity in 'Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon' 1943. Dwight Frye steals all his manic scenes in 'Dracula' 1931. As the 'young lovers' Melvin Douglas and Fay Wray have a nice kissing scene but that's about it. He can be seen in 'The Old Dark House' 1932 and Fay gets dragged around by Joel McCrea in 'The Most Dangerous Game' 1930. Then there's her 1933 classic 'screamer.' Too bad more time money and rewrites weren't available for this film to better showcase the talents and chemistry of Lionel Atwill Fay Wray and Dwight Frye. Sadly then this drearily disappointing film only gets a 4.".

A top notch cast including Melvyn Douglas Fay Wray Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye try hard to make The Vampire Bat believable and it has some nice atmospheric touches and ghoulish moments but it also has a totally ludicrous solution to the mystery and Maude Eburne who makes Una O'Connor look like someone you'd love to spend an evening with! The story concerns a series of vampirelike murders in the German village of Kleinschloss. The local oddball Herman is a chief suspect due to his penchant for visiting victims the night before they were murdered and making pets from the local bat population. The locals obviously having just moved from Ingoldstadt near the Frankenstein residence pursue him to his death which they hope will solve the problem. Kindly Dr. Otto Von Niemann Lionel Atwill even admits that it looks like Herman Dwight Frye could be the one responsible. The local police inspector Douglas finds himself beginning to agree. You know where this is going don't you? Atwill can act this sort of stuff on his head and he's always welcome and value for money. He really needed a better script as it's not very clear exactly what he's trying to achieve. Frankenstein creates a manmonster Von Niemann what looks like a bath sponge!The Vampire Bat never gels very well but it does have its moments notably a medical blood draining session and some shadowy sequences with the murderer leaping across the rooftops near the beginning of the film. I won't go any further into the story other than to say it ends in a rather nasty case of...Epsom Salts! What is of interest is the cast. As well as the horror regulars mentioned above we also have Lionel Belmore Frankenstein Robert Frazer White Zombie and Rita Carlisle Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde to round things out and its always fun to watch such actors go through their usual routines. A minor entry then in the early 30s horror boom not without compensation.".

Frank and his wife Anne first noticed Mollie blossoming into such when she went away to college first to Hawthorne a girls' college in New England and then to a prestigious art school in Paris.

	schema:reviewBody "Of the three comedies that my favorite actor James Stewart made for 20th Century Fox from 1962 to 1965 I like Take Her She's Mine the best. The reason I do is because of all the trouble that Stewart's character a lawyerfatherschool board president named Frank Michaelson inadvertently gets himself into. If you have not yet seen this comedy do not read any further! Not the least of Frank's hassles is the fact that he is constantly being mistaken for James Stewart an inside joke that I think is great! All of Frank's various bizarre actions appear in the newspapers and he is forced to explain them to his school board lest he be dismissed. The main gist of the whole mess is this he merely wanted to make sure his teenage daughter Mollie Sandra Dee stays out of trouble when she goes to college and subsequently when she attends a Parisian art school.The three major newspaper stories and the events leading up to them as Frank explains to the school board in flashback are nothing short of amusing. The first story involves Frank Mollie and other college kids fighting with cops at a sitin to protest local censorship. The second story shows Frank being arrested by gendarmes at a Parisian bordello with a pretty young Chinese girl Irene Tsu clinging to him when all he wanted to do was call a taxi! The third story shows Frank in his underwear jumping off a riverboat he attends a masquerade party as Daniel Boone in order to meet the parents of Mollie's lover Henri Bonnet Philippe Forquet but Frank's costume rips apart! Here are just a couple of other memorable highlights from Take Her She's Mine. While Frank his wife Anne Audrey Meadows and their younger daughter Liz Charla Doherty listen to Mollie's demo record a boy's voice on the recording can be heard saying Hey take it off baby! And Frank raises the ire of Mollie's Parisian roommates when he asks them a rather personal question about their doings.Take Her She's Mine may not have been a big box office success but it is still in my opinion an entertaining comedy. James Stewart does as well as could be expected and is quite funny. Watch for Bob Denver in a supporting role as well!".

His films with Alfred Hitchcock John Ford and Frank Capra have been studied over and over again. But it would surprise many to learn that after the eight he did with Anthony Mann the second place finisher is Henry Koster with five films with James Stewart.The five films are Harvey No Highway Mr. Hobbs Goes On a Vacation Dear Brigitte and Take Her She's Mine. And then they further subdivide as Stewart plays three types of character. He's the absent minded professor in No Highway and Dear Brigitte and the harassed father of girls in Mr. Hobbs and Take Her She's Mine. Both of which he plays to perfection. And of course there is Harvey in a class all by itself.Father is the last to know that his daughter has grown up to be a dish. But that is in fact what Sandra Dee has done. Apparently just hanging around has put all the boys' hormones into an exponential overdrive. Poor Stewart is walking innocently into all kinds of grief trying to protect Dee's virtue. The California based Stewart's concern has taken him to New England and then to Paris.Some pretty funny things happen to poor Jimmy. But I think you'll like best the way his costume falls apart on a chartered boat in the Seine due to some bad advice that he gets from a fellow hotel guest Robert Morley. Still cracks me up 43 years after first seeing it.Audrey Meadows plays the patient wife and mother to Stewart and Dee borrowing a little from Alice Kramden. And I think today's audience will appreciate seeing Bob Denver essentially reprising his role as a Maynard G. Krebs type beatnik. Look for James Brolin in a tiny role as one of the hormonally charged college kids.Koster and Stewart work well together. Maybe at some point his partnership with Stewart will get some study as well.".

Again and again he assumes she is much more of a libertine than she is yet he ends up getting arrested on morals charges himself.While the idea of a worrying father having trouble letting go of his daughter is a clever idea the execution and style leaves so much to be desired. Instead of great insight into a father's worries or simply making a clever film too ofter the film degenerates towards kookiness and cheap laughs. In many ways this movie looks and feels much more like a sitcom minus the annoying laughtrack.The bottom line is that Stewart was an amazing actor whose films are quite often brilliant and sublime.

U.S. release November 1963. U.K. release 26 January 1964. Sydney opening at the Regent. 8789 feet. 89 minutes.SYNOPSIS This is the story of the frustrations of a father sending his dish of a daughter to college. The father Frank Michaelson James Stewart is a respected lawyer and chairman of the School Board who is called to account by Hector G. Ivor John McGiver vice chairman of the School Board because of flamboyant publicity regarding Frank's strange behavior. Michaelson had been reported arrested for participating in a riotous sitin strike over banned books arrested with an alleged Chinese mistress in Paris and jumping into the River Seine in what appears to be the nude. A newspaper editorial demands he resign from the Board. It is Michaelson's explanation of these episodes that is the story of Take Her She's Mine.Michaelson and his wife Anne Audrey Meadows find their lives complicated by that fact that they are the parents of a dish Mollie Sandra Dee and a budding dish Liz Charla Doherty. The father is bent on protecting Mollie at all costs unaware that most of his fears result from an overly alive imagination.NOTES Fox's top domestic moneyspinner of 196364.The play opened on Broadway at the Biltmore on 21 December 1961 running for a most satisfactory 404 performances. George Abbott directed Art Carney Elizabeth Ashley Phyllis Thaxter and June Harding. The Ephrons former staff writers at Fox sold the screen rights of the play to their old studio for 350000. The Ephrons themselves served as the basis for the play's parents their daughter Nora was the model for Mollie whilst the actual college was Wellesley. Ephron of course was also a Fox producer. His credits Carousel The Best Things in Life Are Free Desk Set 23 Paces to Baker Street Sing Boy Sing and A Certain Smile.COMMENT I don't suppose any film genre dates so badly as a sex comedy. Today's taboos are tomorrow's hohums. But Take Her is impossible. Here's a movie that was archly oldhat even at the time it was made. Despite many attempts to be with it and titillatingly daring the script persistently falls pathetically flat. Oldtime pratfalls weak puns that even Shakespeare would have rejected gags that are painstakingly telegraphed five or ten minutes ahead impossibly naive to the point of boneheaded and stupid characters  these are just some of the Take Her vices that make even the dullest of TV sitcoms look positively bright and breezy by comparison. All Nunnally Johnson seems to have done is to aggravate an already overwordy stage play by adding lots more dull and downright tedious padding. Koster's heavyhanded direction worsens the situation no end. As does Stewart's mannered acting. Production values are extremely moderate whilst even normally reliable credits like photography and sets are as dull and uninteresting as the script. Despite the movie's enormous popularity I find it difficult to credit that even the most indulgent picturegoer would find much amusement here. Take Her is not just your ordinary hamfisted farce it's a complete and utter waste of time.".

He letters home indicate that she has met boys and a mysterious telegram arrives at 230 in the morning explaining that all charges have been dropped and she's been released. Puzzled and irritated Stewart flies East where he's introduced to Beatnik coffee houses and sit ins for free speech.Dee flunks out and gets an art scholarship to Paris where she hooks up with a young man who must be handsome because he resembles Warren Beatty. Of course he's an aristocrat and terribly wealthy too so we know the movie will end expectably. Before that happens Stewart flies to Paris to check on her gets arrested in a French whore house and is photographed jumping in his underwear from a tourist boat on the Seine.It was about this time that Stewart made a couple of family comedies  this one Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation and Dear Bridget. This is the best of the three by far. Stewart's appeal was fading because he was getting older as all of us are. He had some good movies ahead of him but few involved romance. Cast as a naive lover as in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence he seemed out of place not because of anything in his performances.He plays the same role here essentially as in Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation  the pompous selfrighteous thoroughly conventional father who is unable to cope with the social changes taking place around him. He can't bring himself to use the word virgin in front of his postpubescent daughter. He's the guy who querulously demands to know why Dee's mother Audrey Meadows hasn't had one of those talks with her daughter to explain the birds and the bees. I swear I'm not making that up.The script is a lot funnier than the other attempts at comedy which were pretty low brow. I'll give an example. Stewart visits a coffee shop in which Dee is employed as a singer and dishwasher. It's all very innocent but Stewart has reason to believe that Dee is a stripper. Peeved but sly he asks the waiter if the girls take off their clothes. No  if they did who would look at them? I'd rather look at my Aunt Minnie. Now Stewart is piqued. He collars the young kid and demands an apology. Why? What's it to you if I don't look at them? Stewart explains he's Dee's father. You mean you WANT me to look at them? Absolutely not! Stewart replies that he doesn't want the waiter to look at his daughter naked but he resents the implication that his daughter isn't worth looking at naked. It sounds silly but the exchange is really amusing and Stewart and Bob Denver handle it perfectly.I find it curious too the way the film balances itself so delicately on the oldfashioned values of the 1950s and the revolution of youth in the 1960s. Stewart represents the former and Dee gradually changes from complacency to independence.Nice job.".

If having been approached for autographs by kids who think that he was the star of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington isn't enough he has to hear wife quote Que Sera Sera from The Man Who Knew too Much.

If this reveals anything it's the ridiculousness of some college aged kids obsession with social issues often doing it simply to be involved with the crowd not even understanding the whole issue and getting involved with the wrong crowd. Stewart getting involved in trying to talk some sense into his daughter keeps getting into hot water thanks to his dizzy daughter. Bob Denver adds a few minor chuckles as a beatnik college student while John McGiver plays the stereotypical staid stick in the mud businessman. One thing the script does get right in this unbelievable version of a forgotten Broadway hit is the description of Dee as Cuckoo the Bird Girl unintentionally getting pop into trouble but he's no rocket scientist either. There have been much better films comic and dramatic about the generation gap here proving that the gap is located between both generation's ears. The film is too episodic to really grab the viewer completely stuck in its decade and locked on its reels with superglue. Poor Meadows is sadly wasted as the stereotypical mom no different than Joan Bennett was in Father of the Bride window dressing only. Unlike the quietly ignored Spencer Tracy in that film though Stewart keeps making a fool out of himself perhaps a good reason as to why pop always pays but never gets involved. Pretty photography in exotic settings doesn't hide the film's mediocrity complete with some truly stinky songs including one about Paris that I hope to never hear again especially as sung by the tone deaf Ms. Dee.".

The body need not be completely naked as partial concealment can be far more erotic.4.Setting  Time and place are not crucial what matters is what happens in the films. 5. Humour Subtle humour is welcome...but fun must not be poked at the sexual act itself.6. What is not allowed There are no restrictions on what may be depicted in the films as long as it is presented in an acceptable way. The only limit is that women must not be subjected to violence or coercion against their will.7.What we hate  is the oral sex scene where the woman is coerced to perform fellatio her hair pulled hard and come is squirted into her face.unquoteI hope this information will help you understand this movie and why man looking for porn would probably give it a bad vote.

Hiring experimental video artist Knud Vesterskov who had next to no experience with conventional cinema albeit of the adult variety for their inaugural effort proved positively disastrous. His selfpenned script relayed entirely in voiceover narration falls squarely into purple prose territory filled with florid metaphors which should raise an occasional chuckle between stifling yawns.The setting's a recent romantic past but rather than give it the full Mills  Boon treatment Vesterskov shatters the illusion right from the getgo with an appallingly inappropriate techno thump by Peter Kyed who scored Nicholas Winding Refn's PUSHER trilogy. A young woman played by Danish singersongwriter Christiane Bjrg Nielsen sits in a gorgeous floral garden reading from her grandmother's diary detailing her erotic awakening at the hands of scarlet woman Lola Katja Kean. Although the movie's ostensible focus granny Constance insipid starlet Anas in the flesh voiced by filmmaker Hella Joof from the excellent OH HAPPY DAY is completely overshadowed by her mentrix who supplies the lion's share of lensed lasciviousness.Only five people do the dirty here so it's a good thing at least that they are all photogenic naturally none more so than the breathtakingly beautiful Kean easily Denmark's most popular porn performer ever. Poor little unseasoned Anas barely stands a chance going up against this one woman volcano of voluptuousness. The three men run the gamut from boyish cute Niels Dencker to muscled macho hunky Mark Duran as welltraveled a stud as the dwindling Danish dirty movie culture currently allows with bald Michael Larsen briefly popping up for a threesome falling somewhere inbetween.It becomes clear quite early on that Vesterskov has little erotic imagination of his own content to crib from recent carnal concoctions such as Philip Christian's IMMORTAL DESIRE and Michael Ninn's FOREVER NIGHT with Andrew Blake's aloof posturing thrown in for good measure. Sex is professionally if dispassionately performed with an obligatory emphasis on female pleasure which need not be a bad thing as Candida Royalle's Femme flicks confirmed time and again. Perhaps Puzzy Power needed a proper pussy in power as Lisbeth Lynghft did a much better job of it on the subsequent PINK PRISON. Only at CONSTANCE's climax pun intended does the spectacle sputter to life with nude under her cloak Kean showing up at gamekeeper Duran's rustic cottage for a Lady Chatterleyinspired roll in the hay that will leave your embers glowing.

Several of the songs in the movie were not even the work of Dresser though the title song is. As the movie notes at the beginning Dresser born Dreiser was the older brother of famed novelist Theodore Dreiser author of that grim classic An American Tragedy. The screenplay is supposedly based on Dreiser's reflective essay My Brother Paul. But if it were this film would be a bit of a drag Paul Dresser's fame was fairly brief and he died young and Theodore Dreiser never wrote anything light. Hollywood was wise enough to make up some harmless stuff pick a beautiful leading lady and play it all for fun.".

Those original songs are what win Academy Awards as he would prove the following year with You'll Never Know.My Gal Sal which along with On The Banks Of The Wabash was the most popular song that Paul Dresser ever wrote serves also as the title of this musical biography of Dresser. Paul originally named Dreiser was the oldest of nine children and the youngest was famed novelist Theodore Dreiser and Dreiser wrote a short essay in tribute to his older brother which was the basis for this film. Young Theodore only appears as a child at the beginning of the film.But the title role is fictional musical comedy star Sally Elliott who is played by Rita Hayworth. She's got publisher John Sutton panting after her but she's got this lovehate thing going on with Victor Mature as Dresser. The plot for Sutton must have seemed familiar it's the same one that 20th Century Fox used in A Yank In The RAF where Sutton was in the same position as in this film only with Tyrone Power and Betty Grable. If this were being made today we would get the real story which was that Paul Dresser was a man of large frame and large appetites. The 'Sal he wrote this song for was in real life a bordello madame of a certain house that he favored and occasionally took aspiring novelist Theodore in for a quickie. He was also a man close to 300 pounds and the guy who could have played him for real at the time was on the 20th Century lot and that was Laird Cregar.But Mature and Hayworth were just coming into their own and Zanuck got full use of them. Mature was his studio's property but Rita was on loan from Columbia where Harry Cohn was starting to realize what a great find Hayworth was. Zanuck was developing his star with three films this one Blood And Sand and Tales Of Manhattan. They both looked real good and sang real good with dubbed voices.A lot of period music costuming and sets is what My Gal Sal gets its best marks for. In fact the film won an Oscar for Best ArtSet Design. Rita looked and danced divinely even using someone else's voice as she always did.It's not the best film of this type that Fox ever did but if your taste does run into period musicals than you can't go wrong with My Gal Sal.".

	schema:reviewBody "My Gal Sal is a simply splendid movie and it's a true wonder why it's not readily available to buy when some of Rita's less good movies Lady From Shanghai Salome are in abundance.Victor Mature plays Paul Dresser who's a song writer from the country who meets a gal called Sal Rita whom he hates then eventually loves.

Paul Dresser Mature is a poor country lad who wants to make it big on the stage with his music. After he meets the comely Mae Carole Landis who after the first thirty minutes of the film vanishes from the scene he makes his way to a stage production only to have the gorgeous redhead star Sally Elliot Hayworth laugh throughout the entire act. In retaliation he takes Mae to one of Sally's shows and they return the favor. She then steals one of his songs and uses it in her act. Paul and Sally continually bring out the worst in each other tempers flaring cutting up each other's wardrobe fighting the strong attraction that all this aggression masks. Typically they finally end up together despite all the misunderstandings along the way.I can't understand why this film is not commercially available it has all the ingredients for a DVD release. As Fox is currently releasing many of its musicals hopefully this one will follow suit. Hayworth who looks beautiful throughout her singing dubbed as usual but her dance numbers are never dull was romantically involved with Mature at the time of filming. Their chemistry is good but not as strong as the electricity she shared with her fivetime costar Glenn Ford. Phil Silvers in a small part here would later costar with Hayworth in Cover Girl 1944.This is a throughly enjoyable movie that deserves lavish DVD treatment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Now available at You Tube and on DVD I had no idea that Rita Hayworth starred in this lavish fun Technicolor Fox musical during her physical peak. Handsome personable hunk Victor Mature got to pursue both Rita and Betty Grable in 3 Fox musicals in '42! Apparently having no musical talent here he portrays a slimmed down version of chubby Gay '90s song writer and theatrical performer Paul Dresser in one of Fox's many nostalgicthemed musicals of this era. The singing of both Rita and Mature was as usual dubbed which downgrades their credibility as musical performers but doesn't materially impact their charisma as all around actors. Fox departed from its dominant star formula for musicals during this era in casting Rita borrowed from Columbia as the sole female musical star. Thus Rita gets to sing and dance in quite a few on and offstage numbers. Meanwhile Mature sometimes sang while playing the piano or banjo. True his supposed playing of two pianos at once looks as fake as it was.Mature's highly romanticized Dresser begins as a young man who runs away from home to avoid preparing for the ministry and to begin a career as a musical performer and song writer. He hooks up with a crooked traveling minstrel getting tarred and feathered when the crowd figures out they have been swindled. He is rescued by the flirtatious female companionplayed by Carol Landis of a traveling patent medicine salesman and joins their entertainment show to attract customers. All this early part is loosely based on fact. Dresser did run away from his dictatorial father and his minstrel employer did run away at one point leaving broke Dresser to pay their bills. He did later work for a patent medicine show selling Hamlin's rather famous 'wizard oil'. The 3 women portrayed as being romantically involved with Dresser are all fictional. Apparently Dresser never married although he had numerous affairs with women including prostitutes. Reputedly the Sal in his well received My Gal Sal was in reference to a previous lover the madam of an Indiana brothel. In the film he didn't compose it until near the end when it serves as the centerpiece of Rita's final stage performance and his excuse to rekindle their ontherocks romance. Phil Silvers doesn't show up until toward the end when he plays a devious role in getting Dresser and RitaSally back together.British actor John Sutton plays Rita's rather stuffy manager and apparent fianc throughout the film. With his initial adversarial relationship with the established musical star Sally and his periodic escapades with the aggressive married Countess Rossini it's an uphill battle for Mature to nose out the cultured handsome Sutton as Rita's 'significant other'. For some reason Hollywood chose to typecast the likable athletic Sutton as 'the other man' sometimes a villainor sometimes as in the present film and the previous Yank in the R.A.F. just the eventual loser. In Hudson Bay he did play the romantic lead to Paul Muni's and Liard Cregar's dramatic coleads and is my favorite film role for him. As someone else pointed out based solely on his girth Cregar presented a much more realistic physical representation of Dresser than did Mature!Why do I refer to Mature's character as 'Jack the Ripper' in my review title? At one point he sarcastically identified himself as such after being jailed for shredding Rita's wardrobe after she had entered his adjacent apartment and done the same. This was her reaction to an intercepted invitation from Countess RossiniSeveral songs by Dresser are featured but the only two that are likely to appeal somewhat to modern audiences are the title song and On the Banks of the Wabash which made him a millionaire by today's standards. Based on the amount of sheet music sold the latter was the second most popular song in the US in the 19th century! Unfortunately the new century would not be kind to Dresser. Like Stephen Foster his career would nose dive and he would die penniless in NYC far from his Indiana home....In addition the team of Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin contributed several original songswhich I like better than Dresser's! the best being On the Gay White Way Oh the Pity of it All and Me and my Fella and a Big Umbrella. Unfortunately Rainger would die that year in a plane collision. He and Robin also composed most of the new songs for Betty Grable's big hit released the following year  Coney Island. Lacking her former film dancer Fred Astaire famous choreographer Hermes Pan served as Rita's dance partner for part of the production number to On the Gay White Way.Poor Carol Landis as Mae after serving as Mature's rescuer and presumably lover for a while gets left behind after Mature is attracted by the challenge of changing Rita's attitude toward him from very negative to positive. Unfortunately this would be the story of her life both as an actress and as a romantic partner except for her many USO appearances instigating her suicide before age 30.".

It's interesting that Paul started out singing at carnivals before hitting the big time on Broadway. I suppose that's similar to singerssongwriters who toiled away in bars before getting discovered.

It is absolutely shameless in its exploitation of excessive violence overacting melodrama lurid sex and rampant drug use...I love it.  Quentin Tarantino as I'm sure everyone knows wrote the story but it is the in execution that this film pays off. The cast oh the cast  The lynchpins are Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette.  They both give solid performances which prevents the film from flying off the tracks they serve as the pilot light.  The supporting roles are the gas.  The WalkenHopper show down has been oft sighted as the film's best aspect and this is arguably true.  Just watch this scene and then watch it again.  Sparks actually shoot out of the screen and burn people about the head and shoulders.  OK you've got Val Kilmer as the ghost of Elvis Brad Pitt as a disgruntled potsmoking loser Tom Sizemore  Chris Penn as cops James Gandolfini preSopranos as a reflective hitman and you've even got Bronson Pinchot from TV's PERFECT STRANGERS for God's sake. Did I forget Gary Oldman? Do yourself a favor and rent every single Gary Oldman related project they're not all good films but....  Why is Gary Oldman not in every film ever made? Why? I ask you why?  He has got to be the best actor working today hands down.  As Drexel Spivey Oldman chews the scenery digests it and then expels it from every orifice.  Keep in mind that he is an English actor with a normal speaking voice at home in the Royal Shakespeare Company.  His performance here is second only to his turn in LEON in blatant overthetop insanity. Tony Scott who along with his brother Ridley has been known to overdirect a film or two here chooses wisely to basically set up the camera and run.  The score by Hans Zimmer adds a bouncy xylophone driven theme to the film and finds the right balance. This a well made ballstothewall popcorn throwing cult classic.  In a market dominated with stereotypical characters this movie avoids that trap by letting the stereotypes flourish with all the grotesque absurdity it can muster. 910".

Quentin Tarantino sold his script to fund Reservoir Dogs and Tony Scott Top Gun got picked up to direct. Some have complained that Tarantino should've directed this film that it's so much his which I agree with considering the story of the film was taken from his 1987 experimental film My Best Friend's Birthday which refers to Clarence in this film going to the Sonny Chiba movies that his own style as a director would've complimented it. It's a nice thought though that's not what we as the audience are left with and so with the final product there is much to admire about the style that Scott uses in the film. He films Tarantino's script from a Roger Avary script originally very much like he's shooting a Hollywood movie as he knows how to with DP Jeffrey Kimball with all the cutaways and editing timing that is expected in a conventional crimedramathriller then by hearing the snapping dialog from the script and the cast performing them Scott does become an important piece of making True Romance a success.The story is a throwback to the old 'lovers on the run' formula among others Clarence Christian Slater in one of his finest is an employee in a comic book store in Detroit loves kungfu movies and big guns and such who gets set up unwittingly with a call girl named Alabama Patricia Arquette. The two fall in love and Clarence feels confident enough by a certain voice in the back of his head provided by Val Kilmer to go and free Alabama for good from her vile pimp and drug dealer Drexl Gary Oldman in one of the better villain roles of the time. He does and through a couple of accidents Clarence and Alabama wind up with millions worth in cocaine and hightail it to LA to sell it as the original mob owners of the coke follow after with explosive results.For fans of the actors in particular the supporting cast True Romance is one of the treats of treats in modern movies on par with Pulp Fiction's roster of knowables Christopher Walken as a gangster who would've thought? Brad Pitt as a stoner roommate Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn as cops a few good lines for Samuel L. Jackson an early plum for James Gandolfini and my personal favorite of the lot Dennis Hopper as Clarence's excop father. Another thing that makes True Romance one of the dare I say most accessible of Tarantino's works is that a viewer who might not know this is his work on first viewing this was me a few years ago sad to say will stay tuned through the whole thing if it's on TV just because of the star power indeed before Oldman's Detrix is introduced into the film TR seems to flow like it'll be a romantic drama with light overtones. All I can say is by the end of this film you will see that good taste can prevail no matter how much bloodshed gets on the screen or how many obstacles get in the way of love and Elvis!.".

True Romance was not a film that got dusted off in the midst of Tarantino fever and is not attempting to be Tarantino'esq in its direction. Actually this was the first script that he ever wrote. It was penned whilst he was working in a video and comic store in Amsterdam. He rented the apartment above anybody who has seen this film will know the parallels with Clarence Worley. Tarantino was actually trying to get his work taken on at the time by some film companies and he requested Scott because he loved his early work. It is true that later on Tarantino kicked up a fuss because they altered the ending and he criticised Scott for making it too Hollywood. Clarence dies in the original script! Anyway Scott agreed to make both endings and let Tarantino watch them Tarantino then conceded he preferred the new version. The film wasn't trying to be Tarantinoesq that part was just the authors input on the film which is not common when people are making films like Harry Potter as the author has no knowledge of film but it is very common when working with screenwriters! This film is the most romantic film i have ever seen brilliant characters amazing sound track brilliant acting  the cast alone informs us that this is one of the best films ever made. Brad Pitt was asked to be a lead character in the film but was working on another at the time. Pitt wanted to be involved so badly that he flew in for a days shooting just to do 6 lines as room mate Floydd. and some cleaning products was adlibbed! Just see this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tarantino wrote an outstanding storyscript and Tony Scott perfectly captured his vision on screen.True Romance is probably the best romance film I have ever seen and the fact that Quentin Tarantino had something to do with it gives you the answer as to why. Ultra violent and seedy you wouldn't expect anything less... Tarantino seriously sprinkles some hardcore magic dust onto all of his projects creating the quality and style we are used to from him. Clarence Worley Christian Slater receives an unexpected gift for his birthday a prostitute called Alabama Whitman Patricia Arquette but Clarence falls in love with Alabama and vows to free and marry her he does so by confronting her pimp Drexl Spivey Gary Oldman and accidentally kills him. Clarence breaks the news to his new love and reveals he has succeeded in taking back her possessions from Drexl but the contents of the suitcase aren't Alabama's possessions it is a large quantity of cocaine. The couple agree to leave Detroit and travel to California with the drugs as Clarence's contact Dick Ritchie Michael Rapaport can sell the drugs there. Highjinks and classic twists and turns ensue as the mob lead by Vincenzo Coccotti Christopher Walken want what they claim to be theirs the cocaine back. This leads to a rather hilarious scene between Walken and Dennis Hopper filmed in vintage Tarantino style having a comical discussion before Hopper is shot dead. Clarence and Alabama arrive in California where they meet Dick his roommate Floyd Brad Pitt and a guy called Elliot Bronson Pinchot Elliot agrees to get rid of the drugs and makes the arrangements with Lee Donowitz Saul Rubinek.At this stage in the film there is a very aggressive fight akin to domestic abuse between one of the mobsters played by the late James Gandolfini and Alabama. This scene can be upsetting to some viewers as Alabama is seriously knocked about and in a critical condition towards the end her face is a mangled mess and her body is cut bruised and bleeding yet in a cinematic sense the scene is quite beautiful and one of the most famous in this very infamous film. True Romance is enjoyable because of the aforementioned magical Tarantino touch or MTT for short the guy can take literally anything and turn it into gold there's no other way to explain why this film is simply so good the plot is simple the whole story is simple but it's how it's filled that counts and True Romance fills its story with integrate little details paying attention and making even its slower points or filler meaningful and enjoyable this is something not a great deal of films bother with. Pop culture runs wild in True Romance as it does in the equally enjoyable Pulp Fiction the music bright colours tongue in cheek language and dialogue it pulls no punches and holds nothing back for anyone a complete and utter politically incorrect film. I was astounded by the amazing performance and work rate put in by Patrica Arquette who could've guessed that in her younger days she really was a stunner? Perfect for the role of Alabama her chemistry with Christian Slater was so convincing too and his performance was one of my favourites of all his films. A cult classic in every sense and a highly enjoyable film to boot I could watch True Romance over and over and never grow tired just brilliant!".

You can tell it was written by Quentin Tarantino and if you didn't know otherwise you'd think it was directed by him too. Every character is brilliantly portrayed. Even supporting actors that only have minimal screen time such as Christopher Walken Dennis Hopper and Gary Oldman give very memorable performances and have some of the best scenes in the film. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette both give Oscar worthy performances in their lead roles. True Romance has the perfect mix of great dialogue romance action and strong violence. Without spoiling the ending what I really wanted from this film was a satisfying ending and it delivered 100. Some scenes will have you laughing out loud while others while have you on the edge of your seat with tension. I don't really see the point of casting Brad Pitt in such a small and unimportant role when any actor could of filled the role but this in no way hinders the enjoyment of the film. The film also has a great soundtrack which I listened to straight after I'd finished and has a good mix of different genre's. True Romance is an astoundingly exciting film and would probably be best enjoyed by fans of Tarantino but I would recommend this film to anyone. Give this film a watch ASAP.".

Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette both give Oscar worthy performances in their lead roles. True Romance has the perfect mix of great dialogue romance action and strong violence. Without spoiling the ending what I really wanted from this film was a satisfying ending and it delivered 100. Some scenes will have you laughing out loud while others while have you on the edge of your seat with tension. I don't really see the point of casting Brad Pitt in such a small and unimportant role when any actor could of filled the role but this in no way hinders the enjoyment of the film. The film also has a great soundtrack which I listened to straight after I'd finished and has a good mix of different genre's. True Romance is an astoundingly exciting film and would probably be best enjoyed by fans of Tarantino but I would recommend this film to anyone. Give this film a watch ASAP.";

	schema:reviewBody "Take a look at the credentials of True Romance. Firstly director Tony Scott  brother of Ridley  had made a series of visually hyperactive and ultraviolent action movies Beverly Hills Cop II Revenge The Last Boy Scout. Secondly writer Quentin Tarantino had penned and directed the groundbreaking Reservoir Dogs. Thirdly the cast comprises of a gallery of supporting slimeballs played by edgy characteractors each of whom had given the world some of THE unforgettable screen characters in their earlier films Dennis Hopper Gary Oldman Christopher Walken Val Kilmer Ed Lauter Bronson Pinchot. Anyone expecting True Romance to be a quiet lowkey gentle crime caper would have to have spent their lives on Mars! True to the form of its bloodobsessed talents it is an energetic foulmouthed relentlessly violent curiously comical crime thriller which commands attention in spite of its intentional excesses.In Detroit young comic book store worker Clarence Worley Christian Slater hooks up with a prostitute named Alabama Patricia Arquette at a latenight movie theatre. Within a few hours they are in love and soon after that they get married. But Clarence still feels the urge to confront Alabama's pimp the dreadlocked psycho Drexl Gary Oldman on the one hand so that he can claim back her suitcase full of personal belongings and on the other because deep down inside he wants to hurt the pimp's pride. Their confrontation turns ugly and Clarence ends up killing his vicious rival afterwards he leaves the scene with what he believes is Alabama's suitcase but it transpires later that he has walked away with a different suitcase containing a fortune in uncut cocaine. Clarence and Alabama skip town and head for Hollywood hoping to offload the drugs onto a movie star or producer at a cut price. Unfortunately both the cops and the drug kingpins are keen to get hold of the suitcase full of cocaine too so they put men on Clarence's trail. Clarence meets up with his old pal Dick Michael Rappaport now a struggling bit player in Hollywood who via a contact arranges a drug sale with an ace movie producer Saul Rubinek. Unknown to each other the various parties who covet the cokeloaded suitcase draw nearer to a fatal blooddrenched rendezvous in an LA hotel room from which noone can expect to walk away alive....True Romance is full of terrific hardboiled dialogue and comical pop culture references. Slater is brilliant in the leading role as is Arquette as his likably weird wife but it's the gallery of crooked supporting characters who rule this movie. Walken has a chilling onescene cameo Hopper is terrific as Clarence's estranged father Brad Pitt turns up briefly as a totally spacedout drug addict and Oldman is instantly fearsome in his electrifying scenes as the sadistic pimp. Tony Scott piles up the body count with one stylishly violent scene after another all set to a soundtrack that is a trashculture aficionado's wet dream. All the cursing bloodletting sex drugs and rock 'n' roll eventually lose their impact through sheer repetition but even then there's still the acting and dialogue to fall back on. You may need to have an amoral streak  or certainly a degree of tolerance  to enjoy True Romance but if you like your movies fast mean and outrageously raw you'll probably have a blast.".

While the title suggests images of hugs kisses holding hands and heartfelt human emotion the film instead bombards the audience with images of blazing guns brutal beatings and lots of gushing blood while telling a twisted and entertaining tale of outlaw lovers on the run.Clarence Christain Slater in his best role ever is a comicbook store employee living a meager but not intolerable life in Detroit.

Little do they know that Drexl's partners led by Christopher Walken's quietly malicious Vincenzo are tracking them and intend to get their merchandise back eliminating the couple for good measure.True Romance is a paperthin but enjoyably quirky romance carried by great dialogue an unpredictable plot and a cast of wildly original characters. The storyline is far from earthshattering but it guarantees some good escapist fun especially since the script boasts a few scenes possessive of great wit and sparkle along with a showstopping one chockfull of dynamic psychological tension  between Dennis Hopper who brings a phenomenal degree of warmth as Clarence's father and Christopher Walken whose vendetta kinda mood headtohead became one of the most memorable sparrings of cinema. Many people may be turned off by the graphic and sometimes savage violence of True Romance. But that is only part of the dirty funny and unpredictably violent genius of Mr. Tarantino.

The performances by Hollywood greats including Dennis Hopper Christopher Walken and Gary Oldman all come so close to being over the top but the incredible script and brilliant directing manage to hold back just enough to stop it going too far.This film is a true masterpiece where everything just falls in to place. The film is not for the faint of heart though. There are very graphic scenes of violence. One particular scene involving a woman getting severely beaten. The perpetrator definitely gets his comeuppance though. While the violence is very graphic as with most of Tarantino's films it is very bloody but also portrayed in a realistic manor.

So when she reveals she is a call girl hired to get him laid on his birthday it doesn't matter and they get married.  Clarence decides to make Alabama's break from the job official by collecting her stuff from her pimp.

The pair say their goodbyes and make off with the drugs to sell them in LA however the drugs leave a track behind them one that both the mob and the police follow.In the height of Tarantino fever several of his scripts got quickly dusted off and handed to big name directors in an effort to capitalise on the public flavour for his dialogue and mix of pop culture references and violence.  True Romance was one such film and in fairness it does fairly well to emulate the films of the writer himself  big cast snappy dialogue violent shoot outs and so on.  In fact the film lifts his style to the extent that it even rips off or homage's other films  most notably in the theme music that is almost a photocopy of Badlands.The film wears this a little too obviously and clearly is trying very hard to be Tarantinoesque most of the time it works out but at times I just wanted it to relax a little bit.  The plot is pure geek wish fulfilment mixed with crime thriller a beautiful woman picks up a comicbook fan in a cinema showing a martial arts triple bill!  It works reasonably well by filling the scenes with colourful characters pop culture dialogue and violence  at times it gets a bit much and I wanted characters to talk normally without a walltowall soundtrack just some of the time however it does have some very good scenes at times.  Stand outs are the scene with Walken and Hopper and the scene where Alabama takes a beating but if you like Tarantino's films then you should be happy with most of this.The style of the film is a little uneven.  As I said it is really trying hard to be a Tarantino film but at the same time you can see Scott's glossy actionmovie hands all over it!  The two don't really fit together all the time and would honestly rather have had a different director at the helm. The cast however is as deep as Tarantino films were drawing at the time  everyone wanted the chance to be cool!  Slater is cool and fits the role well and even Arquette manages to be quite good although her narration is about as flat and dull as they come.  It is the support cast though who the film belongs to.  The film has roles for a variety of people whether it be nonspeaking roles or one or two scenes.  In a way this is a bad thing because some great actors have nothing to do and are wasted but overall the effect is good and each cameo makes an impact.  When a cast includes Val Kilmer Dennis Hopper Gary Oldman Brad Pitt Christopher Walken Bronson Pinchot Samuel L Jackson Victor Argo Michael Rapaport Saul Rubinek James Gandolfini Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore it has to be at least worth checking out!Despite the fact that Tarantino's words in another directors hands doesn't feel that right and the fact that Scott's very slick Hollywood direction doesn't quite match with Tarantino's much less establishment writing this is still a good film.  As you'd expect it rips off every lovers on the run' movie that you'll have seen but it still is funny and slick enough to stand up for the rather generous running time.  It may bottle the brave ending of the original script but it has some very good scenes along the way.".

Yet I cannot shake the idea that perhaps had I watched the film during the time of its release and not seen the other similar films that have been made since I might have enjoyed 'True Romance' a bit more. 'True Romance' is very much a pulp fiction itself no pun intended as Tarantino wrote the screenplay. It's got the hooker with a big heart the 'nobody' who finds a reason to live a fake Rastafarian pimp who thinks he's black the mobster the cops blood murder violence drugs....and there's enough energy to entice the viewer. I enjoyed the numerous Elvis references the wicked humour the dialogues the characters and the performances. Tony Scott does a fine job as director. Christian Slater is great as the likable 'nobody' and Patricia Arquette is brilliant as sweet hooker Alabama. Christopher Walken Dennis Hopper Gary Oldman and James Gandolfini are outstanding.

	schema:reviewBody "'Joueuse' is the promising first feature film signed by Caroline Bottaro who also wrote the script from Bettina Henrichs' first as well novel 'La Joueuse d'Echecs'. The story revolves around Hlne an unsatisfied woman with an undistinguished job hotel maid. She has a kind husband but who has become aloof lately and a teenage daughter who is beginning to become rebellious. One day while she is doing their room she observes a loving couple while they are playing chess on the balcony. Fascinated by this handsome man and this beautiful woman obviously in love having wonderful time together she is so impressed that she unconsciously associates the happiness of the couple with chess. As a result she decides to learn the game and what better chess instructor could she have than Dr. Krger at whose house she does the housework? The trouble is that the retired American a widower is also a grumpy haughty misanthropist. But carried away by her determination she cajoles and coerces him into teaching her the subtleties of chess so much so that she becomes good and even surpasses her master's abilities. And not only does she become a champion but after a period of tension she gets reconciled with both her husband and daughter.Summarized the way I have just done 'Joueuse' could be either good or bad depending on the style or lack of it of its director. It could be heavyhanded gushy or overtechnical in the field of chess. Fortunately Caroline Bottaro does not fall into any of these traps. On the contrary she is a winner in every department.First asset the choice and direction of actors. Sandrine Bonnaire to begin with as fresh sincere and beautiful as ever is an ideal Hlneall more as the actress has gone through basically the same destiny in real life as the fictional character she embodies born into just another family she blossomed into the great actress she is now. Less obvious is the choice of Kevin Kline as Helene's Pygmalion. But the result is fabulous as the intelligent but bitter and lonely Dr. Krger he is totally convincing in his first performance in French. Well directed by Bottaro he succeeds in making the evolution of his character from difficult and unpleasant to humane and respectful quite believable. But the magic of it all is the chemistry both intellectual and sensual that emanates from Kline and Bonnaire and unites them almost mystically. It is also a nice idea to have Jennifer Beals the welder that escaped mediocrity through dance in 'Flashdance' back in 1983 pass the buck to Bonnaire.Second quality Catherine Bottaro films the games of chess very intelligently capturing the suspense inherent in them without being too technical. I personally do not know much to be fair this is a blatant understatement about chess but I never got bored so I presume you will not either. Two games are particularly exciting to watch one played by proxy by Kline and Bonnaire and another one played by the same in which eroticism unexpectedly mixes with the intellectual pleasure of the game.Thirdly the social commentary the description of the working conditions of the characters the threat of unemployment the new class struggle the haves despising the havenots is quite relevant and although only a secondary aspect of the film adds authenticity to the story.Last but not least the writerdirector is a past master at describing the development and side effects of a passion because of it Hlne becomes obsessed by chess isolated from her family cut off from her friends and less effective in her work. But Bottaro also shows how a passion duly channeled by the person concerned and accepted by the persons close to her can transcend her turning the unsatisfied frustrated incomplete person she was at first into a fulfilled human being.A very good selfdiscovery movie set in an amazingly beautiful landscape the Red Rocks in the Piana region in South Corsica which is no bad thing. Not to be missed.".

On one hand the idea that she could accomplish anything even be great or the best at anything seems farfetched to her yet terribly enticing. She is on a journey towards selfrealization that is both exciting and a little scary to Hlne and those around her. Sandrine Bonnaire is absolutely amazing as usual and succeeds in showing the state of mind of her character in very few words. Kevin Kline is great as well playing Dr. Krger the man who teaches chess to Hlne and develops an unusual and complex bound with her. There are lots of nuances in their relationship and again in few words we as viewers can sense a lot is going on. Tension attraction challenges.Caroline Bottaro's direction captures very well Hlne's modest and quiet life and the implicit contrasts between social classes. I recommend this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Helene a married woman in Corsica works as a maid in a local hotel to help her husband a dock worker make ends meet. One day as she goes to clean up a room she is surprised to find the couple staying in it out in the balcony engaged in a game of chess. It intrigues her the way the young woman beats her man in what appears to be skillful playing.Helene also cleans the house of a lonely American widower Kroger living in seclusion in a big mansion. She discovers her employer owns a set of chess. Kroger entering the room she is cleaning sees her observing the pieces of the game and politely asks her to put it back where she found the box. Helene decides this is a game she must learn. It will be her way to escape her dreary life.As her husband's birthday nears she buys him an electronic chess set something that baffles him. Little does he realize the game is not for him but for her. Helene gets bold when she asks Kroger to teach her to play chess in exchange for her cleaning the house for nothing. He agrees and thus begins a strange relationship between these odd couple that apparently has nothing in common.The game begins to take hold of Helene in ways she never suspected. Her work at the hotel suffers because all she thinks is about moves and timing as she prepares herself mentally for the meetings with Kroger. Helene becomes so good she beats Kroger almost continuously something that pleases him. They even share a game where each one go through movements in their minds without a board. They discover an intimacy that will not go beyond the afternoon sessions. In the process Helene gains respect to make it in the local tournament and the possibility of making something else of her life.This is a delicious film that will delight chess players and even people that have no idea about the game. Joueuse is the first film by Caroline Bottaro which she adapted from a Bertina Henrichs novel. The game in a way is a metaphor one in which Helene gets empowerment through her knowledge of a game that is dominated by males. It is also a sort of liberation for the Corsican housewife without any possible future other than being a maid because she has no other skills. Her determination to succeed is bigger than all the obstacles that come her way.An inspired Sandrine Bonnaire one of France's leading actresses is a joy to watch in the film. Ms. Bonnaire is usually seen in more dramatic fare but she makes a delightful contribution to the success of this movie. Kevin Kline surprises as Kroger the enigmatic man suffering an unknown lung disease which never comes clear. The relationship between Helene and Kroger is never sexual although there is an electric current between them all the time.Strongly recommended for fans of chess and for the strong combination of Sandrine Bonnaire and Kevin Kline under the direction of talented Caroline Bottaro a new talent in the French cinema.".

Helene decides this is a game she must learn. It will be her way to escape her dreary life.As her husband's birthday nears she buys him an electronic chess set something that baffles him. Little does he realize the game is not for him but for her. Helene gets bold when she asks Kroger to teach her to play chess in exchange for her cleaning the house for nothing. He agrees and thus begins a strange relationship between these odd couple that apparently has nothing in common.The game begins to take hold of Helene in ways she never suspected. Her work at the hotel suffers because all she thinks is about moves and timing as she prepares herself mentally for the meetings with Kroger. Helene becomes so good she beats Kroger almost continuously something that pleases him. They even share a game where each one go through movements in their minds without a board. They discover an intimacy that will not go beyond the afternoon sessions. In the process Helene gains respect to make it in the local tournament and the possibility of making something else of her life.This is a delicious film that will delight chess players and even people that have no idea about the game. Joueuse is the first film by Caroline Bottaro which she adapted from a Bertina Henrichs novel. The game in a way is a metaphor one in which Helene gets empowerment through her knowledge of a game that is dominated by males. It is also a sort of liberation for the Corsican housewife without any possible future other than being a maid because she has no other skills. Her determination to succeed is bigger than all the obstacles that come her way.An inspired Sandrine Bonnaire one of France's leading actresses is a joy to watch in the film. Ms. Bonnaire is usually seen in more dramatic fare but she makes a delightful contribution to the success of this movie. Kevin Kline surprises as Kroger the enigmatic man suffering an unknown lung disease which never comes clear. The relationship between Helene and Kroger is never sexual although there is an electric current between them all the time.Strongly recommended for fans of chess and for the strong combination of Sandrine Bonnaire and Kevin Kline under the direction of talented Caroline Bottaro a new talent in the French cinema.";

Perhaps the thing I liked best was the wonderful facial expressions. Anyone can learn a line. It takes much more talent to convey a story with a raised eyebrow a cunning smile an expression of shocked surprise. The movie is a winner even if you don't know the difference betaken a pawn and a rook. But if you play chess and understand its culture it is especially engaging. Chess is wrongly regarded as a slow and boring game. Here it has the excitement of a bobsled run. Just a heluva great movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "I was curious to watch this movie based on IMDb's full storyline and Kevin Kline's participation not to mention Sandrine Bonnaire's lead an accomplished international actor I had not seen in a while. I knew to expect a somewhat slow pace because of the storyline logically a slow pace was called for as this had to be a character development piece. Of course I was right I'd skip that comment if I wasn't. There are a few other reviews of the movie preceding mine all quite good as well I'd encourage all to read them since I won't be covering the story as much as those reviews but rather how I feel about the experience.Bonnaire's character has an epiphany while watching Jennifer Beals enjoying a chess match with her friend husband lover the alluring Beals distracting a bit got our heroine Bonnaire thinking. This was the beginning of Hlne's role played by Bonnaire emancipation and self discovery. The movie is the process of Hlne's journey. There's no real or poignant dramatic moment it's not this movie's process. The movie is fluid the flow is however like the smallest of stream and widest river unstoppable.I so enjoyed Kline's acting it is my favourite by him since Silverado1985 and Trade2007 considering his over forty something total movies you can conclude his depiction of Krger role played by Kline was perfect in my view. It's even a pleasure to hear his actual voice recite his dialogue in French. Well it's a French movie in case you had not picked that up yet. His character an expat living out what we believe to be the remainder of his life in Corsica has for me a personal a very appealing romantic edge.Back to Bonnaire she is believable in each and every scene either the director was great at her job Bonnaire is exceptionally intuitive or their collaboration was simply flawless. I'll go with a bit of each. Contextual details were not neglected a subtle reference to the fact that women are a rarity at chess tournaments did not escape me. I know that from personal experience. The crowd 'Hlne' attracts at her tournament match final would have been gawking at a woman in real life as well. I liked this very well done and acted movie I feel sorry so many will not see it or have what it takes to enjoy it.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the first scene I wanted to physically BE where this film was made. The location shots are absolutely stunning. Hlne Sandrine Bonnaire is a maid who works in a hotel as well as the private home of an expat American Dr. Krger Kevin Kline. While at the hotel you get the impression that she is harangued and bothered all day long. She is an invisible worker who people only notice when they have something to complain about. However on this particular day one of the rooms she enters has a young couple playing chess on the veranda. They are separated from her by nothing more than a loose sheer panel that sways gently in the breeze but they may as well be miles away. They beckon her to enter the room and she does but she cannot take her eyes off of them while halfheartedly trying to focus on cleaning the room. They each in turn notice her prolonged gaze but they do not mind. She is asked if she plays chess and says no. In that instant she realizes the great chasm between her life and the two lovers on the veranda. They are carefree they are in love they are fulfilled they are confidant they are happy they understand the game. She perceives their status to be out of her reach. She wants to occupy that space but she just doesn't know how nor does she truly believe that she can.By the end of the movie we see Hlne achieving her goal of playing an intellectually stimulating and sensually arousing game of chess with her own secret lover but her version far surpasses the scene she first glimpsed early on in the film that started the whole ball rolling. The last chess scene is a scene that says so much about the characters their deep understanding of the game their devotion and love to each other intellectual equals duking it out with an invisible board and chess pieces all visualized and strategized in their minds. Their moves are whispered quietly eyes transfixed on each other as they parry for the win. The scene plays homage to the superficially simple yet complex game of chess and to the deep and abiding friendship and love between Dr. Krger and Hlne. She always had the power she just didn't know it nor did she understand how to use it. Dr. Krger filled in the blanks and then some. The last scene between them is probably one of the best love scenes I've ever had the privilege to see on screen. And so I leave you with this Wow!P.S. I found it interesting how this film compares and contrasts with the Japanese film Shall We Dance.".

	schema:headline " Small Sweet Powerful Cleaning Lady Discovers Dignity and Passion Through Chess";
	schema:reviewBody "Queen to Play is a sweet small powerful film about a cleaning woman's discovery of passion and dignity through chess. Sandrine Bonnaire plays Helene a 40 something cleaning woman on the tourist island of Corsica. She's got a nice handsome construction worker husband a snotty teenage daughter struggling through growing pains an imperious boss at a resort hotel and a quiet reasonable lowrent life. One day Helene picks up the game of chess and everything changes. Chess engages her mind and passion. For the sake of learning more about the game she does things she never would have done otherwise. She asks a man she cleans for Dr. Kroger Kevin Kline to play with her. The grouchy older man rebuffs her at first but she offers to clean for free and he accepts. Do you always look at people as if your life depended on their answer to your question? Dr. Kroger asks her. In fact Helene's life does depend on her newfound passion for chess. Helene demands time to learn about the game. She is distracted in conversations were before she might have listened more sympathetically or joined in petty local gossip. She schedules hours alone with a man. She answers back to demanding customers at the resort. She snaps at her family Would it kill you to cook your own dinner for one night? Just who does Helene think she is? She is after all only a cleaning woman the chess club president reminds her. His arrogance will not serve him well when he butts up against Helene. Queen to Play is a small film. The script is spare. The film is lovely but not spectacular. Sandrine Bonnaire's great beauty and her performance are its best special effect. I wish there had been a bit more depth and development. But what is here is really powerful. We've gotten so used in the US to thinking of injustice and prejudice as being primarily about black versus white. Queen to Play shows how being a cleaning woman is itself a handicap in society how expectations can squash a human being and the price people pay for even the most simple gesture of coloring outside the lines of others' expectations. I admire and like Helene as I do few other film heroines. And I'd love to see Bonnaire play a saint someday. Her face is made for it.".

The direction. The cinematography. The other actors. Whatever...The scripting is unfailingly delightful. It presents the initial impetus to investigate the game of chess  a beautiful young woman playing the game with her lover as the driving force that compels the protagonist to visit her husband at work just to touch him to extricate her silky nightgown to acquire an electronic chess game under the guise of giving her husband a birthday gift. It then documents the discovery of meaning and satisfaction in exploiting whatever it is that makes a person excel at some aspect of life and the coincidental growth of desire by her husband to share that life spirit  the initial impetus for all the chess playing that follows. I would say it is nice were it not for the devaluation of meaning of that word. Let's just call it an examination of compulsion That's what the film is really all about. And Bonnaire's range of expressions and demeanors feed that camera with all the raw material it needs to hold us the viewers captive for the duration of the film. Compulsively so and I mean that in the nicest way possible.Actually there is more to it than that. There is that exultation of the human spirit that comes from the process of self actualization. It is a wonderful experience just to observe it up close and personal by watching this film.Compulsiveness Obsessiveness. They are not just the province of adolescent boys with computer games".

It's about the addiction of the game of chess and its appeal. So if you feel nothing for the game then you have been warned! The scenery on the island of Corsica is very colourful.However it's also a somewhat selfindulgent film  it's about addiction after all. There are many long and lingering shots of Sandrine and Kevin staring at each other and then at chess pieces. Sandrine's family is so very much accommodating to her new found passion. There is certain lack of logicality  it takes years with many different chess partners to become a solid player and then participate successfully in a tournament. Still the movie does dreamily captivate.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film A Queen to Play is one French film I enjoyed. I loved the acting of Sandrine Bonnaire! She played her timid meek not outspoken character very well and was able to change with the character into an independent woman who can accomplish great things on her own two feet. I also loved the setting of the movie Corsica is a beautiful area! The director Caroline Bottaro won an award for this movie at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2010. She has worked with Sandrine Bonnaire before in C'est La Vie. Two ideas I thought were interesting about this movie were the idea of a woman playing in a man's sport and the idea of renewing oneself. In this movie the character Helene Sandrine Bonnaire attempts to learn to play chess which the movie portrays as a man's sport. However the men are taken by surprise. The idea of renewing oneself is one main idea that stands out in this movie. Helene starts off as a timid and introverted maid who has settled for her life and goes through the same everyday motions. The movie ends with an independent going after what she wantsand selfsatisfying woman. An example of this would be how in the beginning she never defies her husband and in the end she does what she wants knowing he does not approve nor support her.This movie was wonderful and tells a great story. I recommend seeing it for the acting scenery story line and music. The music in this movie goes along with the setting nicely. The music is light and soft just how Corsica is pictured in the film.The only somewhat negative thing I can say is that the movie is very long for what the story line is. The real action doesn't happen till the very end. However definitely still worth seeing!".

When we first meet Hlne she cleans houses and hotels to help her family husband and teenage daughter make ends meet. Hlne's daily life is routineshe is ignored by her husband and disrespected by her daughter. Seeing an attractive couple playing chess as if it were foreplay Hlne is excited by the idea of the game and buys a computer chess game. She becomes absorbed by the game but can only make limited progress with the computer. She cleans house for a widowed American Dr. Krger who just happens to be a chess player. She asks Krger to play and he finally agrees to a game. I thought I knew where the story was going from there but it did not go there.The main theme touched on is how a passion can change a life. Through her passion for chess Hlne's life is transformed as is the life of her family. Hlne proves false the stereotype that a mere cleaning lady could not be good at chess or for that matter that a woman should not have talent for the game.The relationship that develops between Hlne and Dr. Krger is at the heart of the movie. The excellent performances of Kevin Kline as Dr. Krger and Sandrine Bonnaire as Hlne are what put this movie over the top. They are a delight. The scene where they play a game only by voicing the moves is about as intimate as any love scene.I had a little difficulty believing that Hlne's skill could advance as quickly as portrayed particularly her learning the game in middle age. I would think that the latent talent required would have expressed itself in some manner at an earlier age.For a much more believable chess story see Searching for Bobby Fischer. Based on a true story the kid's development in that movie is exceedingly well presented. A movie that treats the same theme of a passion surfacing at a later age is Everlasting Moments. The passion there is photography and again I found the development in that movie more believable probably due to the fact that that movie is based on a true story. Queen to Play is a fictionalized conflation of these two factbased movies.The gentle musical score makes a good accompaniment. Corsica where this was filmed makes for good background scenery.Although there are elements bordering on fantasy I found this movie engaging and well worth seeing.".

As everybody with some knowledge of the game is aware of draws are the rule among advanced players of chess so a tournament such as the one shown in the movie that works by elimination quarterfinals semifinals final with only one game between a pair of contestants is simply not realistic. The tie could be broken through a game of fast chess but this is not shown either. It goes without saying that the whole dramaturgy of the movie would be significantly altered by the sheer possibility of draws. To sum it up I consider chess a poor choice for communicating the message of this movie.

	schema:headline " French maid leans how to play chess out of curiosity and discovers her true passion for the game";
	schema:reviewBody "Queen to Play is a very heart warming movie with moments that will have you wondering what's going to happen next. It's about a middle aged woman named Helene who works as a traveling maid and sets her sights higher than most. You can tell she is fed up with her current job and needs something new in her life. While she is cleaning a house on her normal schedule she sees the housekeeper Kroger playing cheese with a woman. There both laughing and enjoying their time which is the spark of Helene's new found obsession with chess. She goes out of her way to buy her husband an electronic chess board to see if he will start playing with her but in response he hates it. Finally Helene gets the urge to ask Kroger to teach her while she is cleaning his house. At first he is very skeptical to teach a french woman how to play chess since he is an American. Kroger gives in and teaches Helene everything she needs to know to become the best their ever lived. Helene ends up joining a chess competition where her fate for the future of chess playing lies. Director Caroline Bottaro does a great job on selecting the cast for this movie. She uses Helene played by Sandrine Bonnaire in such a way it gives you the feeling that she keeps getting more and more obsessed with this game. Anywhere from moving bread crumbs at dinner for chess pieces to soap containers in the bathroom. Bonnaire gives off this real energy I feel like someone would have in real life if they were to discover something they had never seen or played before. Kroger played by Kevin Kline is also very well played out. Kevin Kline being on of my favorite older actors has done it yet once again in his very first French film. His French is also remarkable and very well understood. The both of these characters play so well off each other that I believe this is what makes the movie work. Caroline Bottaro is a very young director and still has a huge career ahead of her I hope to see some good movies come from her soon.The cinematography in this movie really does a great job on capturing love suspense and happy moments with close ups and very low angled shots. This adds to the movie more so than just having simple straight on wide angle shots. Notice just simple techniques used like this throughout the movie that makes it just that much better. The music is also something much needed in some parts of the film even though its just chess this movie gives off a suspenseful vibe. I highly recommend this movie for chess fanatics but also people who are into love drama and overall feel good movies.".

Bonnaire gives off this real energy I feel like someone would have in real life if they were to discover something they had never seen or played before. Kroger played by Kevin Kline is also very well played out. Kevin Kline being on of my favorite older actors has done it yet once again in his very first French film. His French is also remarkable and very well understood. The both of these characters play so well off each other that I believe this is what makes the movie work. Caroline Bottaro is a very young director and still has a huge career ahead of her I hope to see some good movies come from her soon.The cinematography in this movie really does a great job on capturing love suspense and happy moments with close ups and very low angled shots. This adds to the movie more so than just having simple straight on wide angle shots. Notice just simple techniques used like this throughout the movie that makes it just that much better. The music is also something much needed in some parts of the film even though its just chess this movie gives off a suspenseful vibe. I highly recommend this movie for chess fanatics but also people who are into love drama and overall feel good movies.";

Kudos to the chess technical adviser.Some pretty nice photography of the French or is it Corsica? countryside. Kevin Kline's character is well drawn.

It didn't quite compute with his character.After training her in the art of thievery Rex finds Rita balking at the more disagreeable parts of his profession. So she can never testify against him he marries her. Apparently that must be a part of the Spanish legal system as well even under Francisco Franco. Later on she turns the tables on him but you have to see the film to find out how and why.Color cinematography might have helped especially since a good deal of this film was done in the Prado Museum and the movie audiences could have gotten a look at some of the great old masters like Goya El Greco and Velasquez.In the end The Happy Thieves depends on the charm of its leads and they're not up to it.

A painting belonging to Duchess Blanca Alida Valli is stolen from a castle in Spain by the two thieves but then it's stolen from them by the Duchess' cousin.Eve wants to call it quits but the thief one Dr. Munoz Gregoire Aslan blackmails the couple and wants a piece of art from the Prado museum. They have a duplicate made by Jean Marie Calbert Joseph Wiseman planning to switch the paintings during a farewell bullfight for the duchess' fiance a matador.A few things could have helped this film. One was a color production. It is Europe and does deal with art after all. The second thing that would have helped was a more exciting actor as Jimmy. Rex Harrison was a marvelous actor but somehow wrong for this role not dashing charismatic or romantic enough. The last thing that would have helped is a faster pace.The Happy Thieves was based on a book by Richard Condon and directed by George Marshall both very accomplished but this isn't the best representation of either one. Hayworth in her forties here is beautiful graceful and does a good job. The film was produced by her last husband and she later pronounced it rubbish. It moves fairly slowly but the paintingswitching scene is very good. Not awful not great. Seeing Rita Hayworth is always worthwhile.".

For some people it's an environmental film for some people it's an ode to technology for some people it's a piece of sht for other people it moves them deeply. It depends on who you ask  Godfrey ReggioSo Koyanisqaatsi. Boring junk to some an involving masterpiece to others and God knows what other adjectivenoun combinations are out there you can probably guess my opinion from the rating above. Most of these descriptions are fairly subjective but it would definitely be wrong to regard Koyanisqaatsi as anticinema. It is anything but. Cinema in its purest form is a marriage of sound and visuals everything else is just decoration. Dialogue? Storyline? Koyanisqaatsi harks back to an age when cinema was simply a filmed record of a situation. Was it not the Lumiere brothers who are generally regarded as the first pioneers of cinema? And is it not the case that their films comprised of nothing more than situations like a couple feeding their baby workers leaving a factory or the infamous Train Leaving A Station which went down in folklore as causing people to flee the auditorium in panic thinking they were about to be hit by a train as it approached them onscreen? Koyanisqaatsi is cinema returning to its roots to the days when the possibilities for film as an art form were wide open free of commercial constraints and fickle audiences too narrow in scope to accept anything other than what they view as the given norm.In a way it's fairly irrelevant what Koyanasqaatsi meant to me on a personal level though I might get to that later. What's important is what Koyanasqaatsi represents. It's an interesting attempt and a successful one in my view to illustrate how a narrative can be created simply by editing together seemingly loosely related scenes and images. It reminds me of another cinematic milestone the Kuleshov experiment in which two separate images where edited together to create a third meaning and which helped establish what is now known as Russian montage and speaking of the Russian montage tradition anyone who has seen Vertov's The Man With The Movie Camera will no doubt find traces of it in Koyanisqaatsi and vice versa. Koyanisqaatsi takes it one step further perhaps even to its logical conclusion using editing to create a new meaning for the entire narrative as a whole. It works on a gut level and sparks an emotional response in a way it demands a response be it boredom amazement... it really depends on the person as illustrated by the Reggio quote above. As such it's an example of cinema at its most subjective.Coming back to the influence Man With A Movie Camera no doubt had on this film I think what Godfrey Reggio has done here is take this specific style of filmmaking and turn it into what I personally view as a cinematic statement on humanity and our technology's relationship with the environment around us. It's a pessimistic film filled with Cold War anxiety though it hasn't lost any of its relevance  and in retrospect I also found it reminiscent of an age when America still had a strong avantgarde movement in the shape of people like Reggio or Laurie Anderson and in a way it's an interesting coincidence that 1983 also gave birth to another experimental documentary Chris Marker's Sans Soleil which is equally rich in scope and tackles the same philosophical issues albeit from a slightly different angle.I really wonder if the western world could produce a film like this today in an age where cinema audiences are more fickle than ever demanding a cut every three seconds and some sort of surprise twist at the end with hardly a niche left for the Godrey Reggios of this world. But in a way I suppose it doesn't really matter. Koyanisqaatsi to me at least is one of the richest cinematic experiences anyone could possibly hope to have and I doubt I'll see a film which will move me quite like this for a long time to come.".

	schema:reviewBody "Godfrey Reggio's Koyaanisqatsi 1983 is a film with no actors no storyline and no dialogue. The only things we see during the experimental documentary's 87 minutes are natural landscapes images of cities and real people going about their regular lives. Yet from the very beginning when we see the title of the film appear in bloodred characters and hear the voice of a bass soloist chanting the title like an incantation it is difficult not to be swept away in captivation.Filmed between 1977 and 1982 Reggio's film was noticed by directing great Francis Ford Coppola who eventually agreed to finance the project and give it chances for distribution. Minimalist composer Philip Glass was optioned to compose the score and the result was quite simply astounding.Koyaanisqatsi is a collection of familiar images presented through tinted lenses figuratively speaking. The experimental nature of the project can be seen in the reduced and augmented speeds of images the use of carefully manipulated edits and the use of Glass's score to create ambience. There are times when the film exhibits an almost surreal quality more indicative of a twisted futuristic dystopian scifi epic than of our mundane world.This is however what makes Koyaanisqatsi so successful. In presenting our world in a disquieting unflattering light the film forces us to ruminate on our place in the universe and the consequences of many of our actions. The film starts with serene austere images of mountains oceans and forests and the repetitiveness of Glass's score does not bore us nor call attention to itself but simply washes over us entrancing us and instilling a sense of tranquility.It is not long before the untainted images are replaced by nuclear power plants highways skyscrapers rubble fire and ash and hoards of antlike beings humans of course scurrying through modern urbanity. Most times humans are filmed at lowframe settings making for faster speeds and as a result they seem frenzied compulsively making their way through the cities in a manner that seems more conditioned than voluntary.Glass's score responds by heightening its tension and adding a semibrutal nature to its repetitiveness. It is somewhat aversive but at the same time exhibits a humorous and mocking quality. By cramming together so many images of humans behaving more like lab rats than higher thinking beings and increasing the satirical nature of the score the film invites us to consider just how depersonalized mechanized and outofcontrol many aspects of our life are.The conclusion of the film contrasts against the blackly comic nature of the previous section by instilling a sense of mourning and warning. As such there is undoubtedly a political and environmental component inherent in this film but this is the aspect that is in my mind most often misunderstood. Many critics mostly detractors have interpreted Koyaanisqatsi as a call to action an invective that demands that we atone for the rapelike pillaging the human race has thrusted upon the natural environment. Following from this these critics claim that the film's message is that we would enjoy the planet more if we were not here at all thus presenting a contradiction since we would not be here to enjoy it.In my own personal view the flaw here resides in viewing the film as a tirade and a call to action. I find Koyaanisqatsi very clearly to be not a cry for reform but a demand for awareness and meditation. There is an inevitability in the actions of human beings and their disregard for the care of their surroundings and the wonderful thing about this film is that it forces you to experience the consequences and at least take notice of what each of us is contributing. It does not let you get away with indifference and nonchalance.For me however the political component is less important than the stylistic component which is one near and dear to my heart the use of music to enhance the forcefulness of images. I acknowledge the fact that some will not be able to stand the repetitiveness of Philip Glass's score and it is very repetitive at some points. But if one can consider the motive behind the repetition the music ceases to be oppressive and becomes sublime and entrancing. The score adds impact to an already stunning array of unforgettable images the details of which I will not go into so that one may see the film with fresh eyes.I saw Koyaanisqatsi for the first time at a performance in which the visuals were projected onto a giant screen with the soundtrack being supplied by Glass and his ensemble who had come for a live performance. I had barely made it in time since I struggled to find a parking space and was drenched from running in the rain. The moment the film started however all of the accumulated tensions in my body completely dissipated. It was not at all a cerebral experience but an instinctive one in which I enjoyed the images and sounds for their own sakes.When I left the performance I was in a hypnotic daze transfixed by what I had just seen. My initial impressions haven't changed to this day. I loved this film and while the political and environmental concerns it addresses are important what really makes this film for me is the instinctive visceral power of its images and sounds. Koyaanisqatsi maroons its audience in an alternate version of reality that sheds disturbing light on our lives and yet at the same time it produces an unforgettable cinematic experience that is pervasively engrossing.".

Many critics mostly detractors have interpreted Koyaanisqatsi as a call to action an invective that demands that we atone for the rapelike pillaging the human race has thrusted upon the natural environment. Following from this these critics claim that the film's message is that we would enjoy the planet more if we were not here at all thus presenting a contradiction since we would not be here to enjoy it.In my own personal view the flaw here resides in viewing the film as a tirade and a call to action. I find Koyaanisqatsi very clearly to be not a cry for reform but a demand for awareness and meditation. There is an inevitability in the actions of human beings and their disregard for the care of their surroundings and the wonderful thing about this film is that it forces you to experience the consequences and at least take notice of what each of us is contributing. It does not let you get away with indifference and nonchalance.For me however the political component is less important than the stylistic component which is one near and dear to my heart the use of music to enhance the forcefulness of images. I acknowledge the fact that some will not be able to stand the repetitiveness of Philip Glass's score and it is very repetitive at some points. But if one can consider the motive behind the repetition the music ceases to be oppressive and becomes sublime and entrancing. The score adds impact to an already stunning array of unforgettable images the details of which I will not go into so that one may see the film with fresh eyes.I saw Koyaanisqatsi for the first time at a performance in which the visuals were projected onto a giant screen with the soundtrack being supplied by Glass and his ensemble who had come for a live performance. I had barely made it in time since I struggled to find a parking space and was drenched from running in the rain. The moment the film started however all of the accumulated tensions in my body completely dissipated. It was not at all a cerebral experience but an instinctive one in which I enjoyed the images and sounds for their own sakes.When I left the performance I was in a hypnotic daze transfixed by what I had just seen. My initial impressions haven't changed to this day. I loved this film and while the political and environmental concerns it addresses are important what really makes this film for me is the instinctive visceral power of its images and sounds. Koyaanisqatsi maroons its audience in an alternate version of reality that sheds disturbing light on our lives and yet at the same time it produces an unforgettable cinematic experience that is pervasively engrossing.";

There is an unbelievable amount of talent behind this film both in the fascinating images that are presented and the mesmerizing score by Philip Glass. It is a very slow moving film but it manages to keep your attention because in many cases it is just so interesting to see the things that are portrayed and the way that they are shown. This is the only film for example where you can see a shot of a 737 approaches directly toward the camera over a hot runway in a shot that is possibly over a minute long with no movement other than the sluggish lumbering of the massive plain.Godfrey Reggio takes Glass's score and places images over it that add to the sound and create an experience that is far greater than as they say the sum of its parts. The shots contain camera movement or lack movement are sped up or slowed down and have live sound or no live sound depending on the desired effect and the end result is absolutely hypnotic.This is a wonderful cinematic experience for people of all ages and possibly my favorite thing about this film and it's successors is that because they have no dialogue they can be shown in any country in the world and not have to worry about subtitles or even altered meanings. This is a film for humanity.".

I wasn't a huge fan of Philip Glass I'd never heard of Koyaanisqatsi or Godfrey Reggio but what the hell I went along expecting some sort of nicelyfilmed but vaguelyboring worthy documentary.An hour  a half later I was  and I'm having to try very hard to find adjectives here  in fact I'm failing. It was TheThingThatYouCan'tEvenTellSomeoneWhatItIs. Completely transfixed transported for 90 minutes of my life.This film has no dialogue. It has no actors apart from everyone  everything that Ron Fricke's camera touches. It has no plot apart from just the simple complex unfolding story of the world.The truth is of all the films that people feel have really made an impact on their lives  and you only need to read through this lengthy thread to see how many of those people there are  this is one of the hardest to communicate to someone who hasn't actually seen it. You can compare it perhaps to things they might have seen  but there aren't that many to compare to. It has a kind of poetry on a whole different level from for example Man with a Movie Camera. The only things that spring to mind for me are Orphee or Last Year at Marienbad but these are completely different kinds of movie and even people who don't like them might be totally taken apart by Koyaanisqatsi.Sure you could  rightly  use phrases like breathtaking cinematography or unforgettable images. You could praise the music which really opened my ears to Philip Glass. You could point out as many have done how the film made you look again at the world  at your own place in it. Or you could try to relay its environmental message  and there are people especially those who take any implied criticism of our species' waste and cruelty as a kind of personal insult who will not like that message.But none of these things would come close to capturing what makes this film so special. Like trying to explain red to someone who's never seen colours. You have to experience it. If possible in a cinema sitting right down at the front completely immersed in the screen and its images.I know I'll never forget the first time I saw it. You might not either.".

Or you could try to relay its environmental message  and there are people especially those who take any implied criticism of our species' waste and cruelty as a kind of personal insult who will not like that message.But none of these things would come close to capturing what makes this film so special. Like trying to explain red to someone who's never seen colours. You have to experience it. If possible in a cinema sitting right down at the front completely immersed in the screen and its images.I know I'll never forget the first time I saw it. You might not either.";

	schema:reviewBody "Koyaanisqatsi is a unique and thoughtprovoking film. It came out at about the same time as My Dinner With Andre another unique and thoughtprovoking film which used conversation as virtually the sole method of communicating. Whereas My Dinner With Andre consisted entirely of a conversation between two actors and resulted in the formation of numerous local discussion groups by devotees Koyaanisqatsi passed relatively unnoticed perhaps because it used the opposite technique of relying only on images and music with no dialogue whatsoever. I found both films fascinating.The first half of Koyaanisqatsi is of a world full of beauty. The most memorable images for me are timelapse photography of clouds and their shadows moving across the canyoncountry landscapes of the desert southwest. Anyone who has spent hours gazing into a fire or watching waves at the beach will find the photography mesmerizing  one of few film experiences that convey natural beauty almost as well as the reality itself.The second half of the film is an intentionally jarring contrast starting with a depiction of mechanized destruction of the same beauty for human purposes i.e. mining coal to produce electricity. The message soon becomes overwhelmingly plain We are screwing the place up and are immensely poorer for it. The sourpuss face of frustration and disgust on a woman vainly trying over and over again to light her cigarette with an empty lighter summed it up for me although other viewers of any sensibility will find plenty of disturbing images from the second half of the film to identify with.As my friends and I left the theater sadly this is one of those films that loses some of its impact on the small screen one remarked It's been done. They've made the movie I wanted to make. Some of the commentators here have basically said that while Koyaanisqatsi is undoubtedly a very good film they didn't like the message one referred to people who would enjoy the movie as misanthropes.While its opposite film My Dinner With Andre was full of discussions about the unarguably wonderful metaphysical potential of sentient beings such as ourselves and while I enjoyed it a great deal the contrast between the two seemed to point out that we as a species really are rather full of ourselves at times. Whether one is inclined to agree or just wishes to see a glimpse of another point of view one cannot go wrong seeing Koyaanisqatsi. Like the Angel of Death silently pointing out to Ebaneezer Scrooge the error of his ways this film's message IS unmistakable and needs no words.".

Quite long and meditative.Man With a Movie Camera' is even less accessible narratively but far far more cinematically poetic than this.Trivia I think I know the Air Force pilot dwelled upon about midway through.

The cinematography and editing are absolutely superb and the driving soundtrack by minimalist composer Philip Glass is unquestionable brilliance.

Only now have I been able to get a DVD and feast myself to one of the most mesmerizing documentaries I've seen. Now I can get to see the sequels...In the twentyfive years since its release nothing much has fundamentally changed. The only real difference is that the scale of life out of balance has ballooned to the point where humanity has finally realized  perhaps too late  that we are indeed on the path to selfdestruction unless radical steps are taken to change our ways. Some might argue that I'm too pessimistic and point to the Montreal protocol it set the wheels in motion to stop using CFCs that were causing the depletion of the earth's ozone layer as proof that we can pull together when danger is imminent.Perhaps true...but the problem is that many still don't think that life on earth  not in the upper atmosphere  is truly out of balance. This documentary takes us all back to what it was like all those years ago  and as you will see or have seen on your TV news programs today it's now all that much worse...The metaphors abound beginning with Earth Air and Water as the three dominant and necessary conditions that permit life on this planet then relentlessly but gradually showing how humanity changes the very conditions that support balanced life. Mountains explode fires consume people increase and multiply together with the trappings humanity needs to keep consuming traffic jams food and automobile production steel and glass monuments to Mammon  surely a parody of Kubrick's images of the monolithic Sentinel in 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968  freeways that look like arteries with blood coursing through veins images from space that show glowing cities which morph into electronic circuits for computers  we've become the machines we've invented  and of course the milling millions moving through life as though they are the walking dead oblivious to all except the self and selfgratification.It is at once a pretty picture and a damning one  of particular note the sequenced implosion of the abandoned PruittIgoe housing complex in St Louis designed ironically by the architect of the World Trade Center Minoru Yamasaki.The music very sensibly doesn't belabour the use of the title it's chanted only during the opening sequence and during the finale which in my opinion is the most stunning tracking shot I've seen yet as the camera follows the detritus from an exploding rocket a Russian one I think plunging back to earth.

Nonnarrative kaleidoscopic view of mid80's America combines scenic and street scenes with spedup images of everyday life including vehicle and pedestrian traffic and manufacturing processes. The adjustment in speed lets us see things a little differently and maybe more perceptively. It doesn't sound like much but when it's perfectly wed to a unique musical score it rocks. Reminds me a little of the surfing movie Thicker Than Water in its inspired combination of image and sound. I watched this last night and now I'm watching it again today. Note I thought that was the Challenger explosion at the end of this until I saw this movie was released 3 years before that. Pretty weird. A big 10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is not very much to say about this film.  The bulk of the work that was done is obviously the filtering of the archive material because I don't think there is much original material in Koyaanisqatsi.  'Monsters of grace' Philip Glass and Robert Wilson 1998 had more interesting visual material you will not find it on IMDb because it is an opera in 3D.  The concept isn't very intellectual or groundbreaking once you've got the idea i.e. accelerating images of our world and the consequences of human behaviour you only need to work it out which doesn't require much intelligence or time or even words in this case.  Credit director Godfrey Reggio Powaqqatsi Naqoyqatsi and cinematographer Ron Fricke Chronos Megalopolis.  The sequel Powaqqatsi proves unfortunately that it can be done with even less intellectual work.  It's a cinematic opera about exactly what you see and hear and it doesn't inflict a lot of discussion afterwards in contrast with e.g. '2001 A Space Odyssey'.But this all doesn't make it less interesting.  Philip Glass Candyman The Truman Show probably did the most fascinating work with the score.  I won't explain what Glass' music is like but I think I will not forget those tunes the rest of my life.  Although others might think this is a universal film because it's mesmerizing or whatever I don't think it's open to many explanations or interpretations.  See for yourself.  It's simply a nice piece of cinema that can probably stand the test of time and can be seen every ten years or so.  But it is not a recommendation for everyone.  I can't wait to see Naqoyqatsi part three of this presumable trilogy.  BTW I still can't figure out what Coppola's got to do with this film.810".

The experience of viewing these films is akin to looking at a painting or contemplating the subtle changes in nature.Unfortunately Koyaanisqatsi just does not quite make it. In places where it should allow the natural and accidental beauty of a subject to come through it instead uses pointed repetition to preach a onedimensional message. If it encounters an interesting subject it lingers on far too long. Please note that I have a lot of patience with meditative art being a longtime fan of Wim Wenders the composer Morton Feldman and the painter Robert Ryman. I can handle art that explores deeper and deeper examining the hidden and bringing to light details that no one ever has seen often including the artist see John Cage's works on the process of art as a process of exploration for both audience and author. But Koyaanisqatsi finds a scene of moderate interest and hammers on it until there is nothing left to see in it and KEEPS ON GOING. So much for subtle variation.Overall Koyaanisqatsi comes across as a spoof of minimalist excess. It's like the minimalist painting that REALLY IS just a white canvas. This mindnumbing effect is reinforced by the relentless music of neobanalist Phil Glass. Meaningless harmonic structures crudely stitched together repeating over and over proclaiming the composer's incompetence at every pseudocadence.This is maybe a good movie for pothead hippies or maybe for teenagers trying to find some meaning in the many superficial contradictions in the world. Perhaps it can be a way to wean American youth away from too much Chuck Norris. But maybe it really isn't any better for them than Chuck Norris.".

Watching Koyaanisqatsi with some knowledge of Hopi culture goes a long way towards truly enjoying this film.I have seen Koyaanisqatsi numerous times every time on the big screen and I believe that seeing it in cropped 169 aspect ratio can't do it justice. Having said that it is still better to see it even in 169 then not to see it at all. although I would advise against watching it in 169 on a small screen TV.Koyaanisqatsi is a film with no dialog actors or even a story. However to those familiar with concepts which are in the film this work of art has a lot to offer.Hopi Indians believe that God or Massaw as they call the creator created four distinct races to develop four essential elements earth wind water and fire. The first part of the film illustrates that although beautiful imagery can easily distract us in a good way from noticing that pattern is followed.It is the white man that developed and is still developing what can be done with fire element mining and excavation arms nuclear weapons engines and power plants. In the process all kinds of fuels are needed and consequences were foretold by Hopi prophecies  If we dig precious things from the land we will invite disaster.Without narration dialog or acting Koyaanisqatsi communicates very well dangers and pitfalls of careless modern development which is quickly surpassing our abilities to control it. In this respect the film could be seen as pessimistic but I look at it more as an observation. Koyaanisqatsi is not a criticism of all modern technology rather a look at from a fresh perspective of what we are doing to the world we inherited and seem to take for granted. It doesn't let us turn a blind eye to our race with ourselves in which essential earthly and human values are left behind. Even with the film being 25 yrs old the freshness is preserved and is it's key element.Koyaanisqatsi is probably the most enjoyable and moving portrait of our planet and humankind and should definitely be a centerpiece of some timeandspacefloating timecapsule.For me Koyaanisqatsi is one of only a few films which I consider works of art in the deepest sense.Unless you are into plots and action you will not be disappointed by this film in fact this will be the fastest 100 minutes of your life and it could be the most enjoyable film you ever saw.".

Mind you this is a Bmovie and to really appreciate it you should remember that it has a very modest budget and modest castand they did pretty well with these constraints.The film stars a big western star of the day the all but forgotten George O'Brien as well as an up and coming star Tim Holt. It also offers a very rare chance to see a very young Rita Hayworth before she was reinvented by Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn. What I mean by this is that Cohn envisioned her as a big star and had her makeup hair and even hairline altered to create a much more glamorous image. Here in The Renegade Ranger although she's pretty she isn't yet the stunner she'd soon become.As far as the plot goes the only way this really differs from the 101231092312 other westerns with evil bossmen is that the leader of the opposition is a lady Hayworth and an exRanger Holt is working both sides of the fence during the picture! So why if it's so familiar do I recommend it? Well the acting. The three leads were a good bit better than usual for such a film and they managed to carry it offmaking the acting seem more natural than usual. Worth your time.".

But it's relative newcomers Tim Holt and Rita Hayworth that really shine. Holt seethes with talent and emotion. And Hayworth just seethes.You can tell both are headed for great things. Holt would become RKO's top B Western star with occasional forays into A pictures such as Magnificent Ambersons and Treasure of the Sierra Madre. And Hayworth would become a superstar.The writing is equally solid. Frequent B scribe Oliver Drake gives a sympathetic portrayal of Mexican outlaws in Texas. Proving once again that B Westerns aren't as politically retrograde as many think.Yup all this is good. But RKO B Westerns also have downside. The action isn't that wellstaged. And there's never enough of it. This film is no exception there either. Promised fights are over too quick. Promised showdowns look confused and unfocused. And without good action a Western can really drag. And this one does.Still The Renegade Ranger is worth a watch for the intriguing plot reliable O'Brien and especially the nascent talents of Holt and Hayworth.".

	schema:headline " Rita to the rescue of Mexican landowners in Texas";
	schema:reviewBody "THE RENEGADE RANGER 1938 is a 59minute Bwestern about how white expansion in Texas forced out Spanish and Mexican landowners. Rita Hayworth plays Judith Alvarez daughter of a Spanish landowner whose land has been taken by white landgrabbers working with a corrupt sheriff. She leads a band of Spaniards and Mexicans in making attacks on the ranchers who've taken their land illegally. Tim Holt plays a frustrated exTexas Ranger who wholeheartedly joins Alvarez' band and helps in their efforts. He even acquires a Mexican girlfriend Cecilia Callejo. George O'Brien plays Holt's Texas Ranger buddy who joins the gang himself working undercover on assignment to capture and arrest Miss Alvarez. Holt is torn between loyalty to Alvarez and her cause and his friendship with O'Brien. O'Brien gradually falls in love with Judith himself which complicates matters even further.This is a fascinating movie on multiple counts not least of which is the presence of Rita Hayworth in the role of an Hispanic crusader against white depredations. Hayworth was of Spanish descent herself real name Margarita Carmen Cansino and her band is cast entirely with actual Mexican actors. The more Bwesterns I see the more I realize that appropriate ethnic casting of Mexican and Indian roles was the rule and not the exception in this genre. Hayworth was all of 19 when she made this and she was already a great beauty adorned in stylish western fashions that bring out the best in her. It's easy to see the roots of the glamorous movie star and pinup queen she'd become in a few short years.Also the whites except for the two male stars O'Brien and Holt are generally bad guys here and the taking of land from its original owners is condemned. No word though about the souls who occupied the land before the Spaniards arrived but that's another story. I've seen another western with this plot recently California Frontier 1938 starring Buck Jones as an army officer working undercover in California to thwart white landgrabbers taking land from Mexicans. Rita herself had costarred in a similar western in 1936 REBELLION. I imagine that further exploration into the vast uncharted territory of the Bwestern will yield additional gems.".

She's the descendant of former a Spanish land grant family and she and her tenants are being cheated systematically by crooked politicians. But he's got a complication he didn't figure on. Former Texas Ranger Tim Holt who is in fact the title character has turned outlaw and has joined Hayworth. He doesn't give O'Brien away but in fact he convinces O'Brien to start investigating the corrupt land grabbing politicians in the region. The film is a well constructed and well plotted B film. In the Citadel Series Films of Rita Hayworth George O'Brien said that Rita was a promising newcomer who was eager to learn and took advice and criticism well.

	schema:reviewBody "Too bad that George O'Brien is largely forgotten among front row kids. He may not have the charisma nor singing voice of a Rogers or LaRue but his burly physique is perfect for action roles. Here it's really Holt who has the eyecatching charisma. No wonder he was soon featured in his own series. Of course the chief attraction is Rita Hayworth before her career took off. She's certainly a striking presence but for curiosity seekers like myself it's hard to tell with that hat on whether this was before or after her hairline was raised. It certainly made a difference in appearance. Check out Charlie Chan in Egypt 1935 for a revealing glimpse.The programmer itself has a couple of good plot twists a tricky exRanger Holt with a wobbly moral compass and a misled Ranger O'Brien who chases after the wrong gang. The plot's also driven by a conflict between Latinos whose land ownership derives from Spanish land grants and a ruthless frontier landgrabber who wants to scheme the land away from them. Conflict over Spanish land authority is an interesting historical twist I never really thought about. On the other hand I've got to agree with another reviewer who finds the action scenes foreshortened and not very exciting. Anyway it's the thoughtful storyline along with Holt and Hayworth that make this oater worth sticking around for. A 6 on the matine scale".

The colorful border atmosphere is somewhat captured in this otherwise routine western movie.Established star and reallife American hero George O'Brien is strong in the lead role and young buck Tim Holt is an unpredictable and mercurial kid Ranger and they are both fine in their roles ordinary as the roles may be. Veteran actors do good work in support.But now the reason for my review of this movie stunning young Rita Hayworth. Her beauty and screen presence jump off the screen. She has obviously got it. Her acting is forceful and her wardrobe ranges from pretty dresses to riding clothes that do not or cannot constrain certain parts of her upper torso. As a side note I could mention that she does an impressive amount of her own horsemanship in this film. And if I was a rider in her vigilante justice group I would surely follow her to hell and back. Hayworth is a young actress giving a good performance here that sets her up for the launch of her soon to be megastardom and deservedly so. OK its only an ordinary bwestern.

When the successful writer of horror tales Nol van Paulo Tom Jansen comes for a lecture in his class he advises Onnonval to never write a story for the evil Ferluci Fred Goessens. However Onnoval is humiliated by Gino and very upset and jealous he writes a story about a class excursion in a horror bus to a horror park where Gino is killed by a vampire and gives his story to Ferluci. Later he regrets but Nol van Paulo tells him that the only way to fix the situation would be stealing his note book and rewriting the conclusion.I have never heard anything about this character or this novel apparently very wellknown in Netherlands but I really liked this enjoyable movie. The special effects are weak probably due to a restraint budget but never depreciate the story since the screenplay is original funny and full of action. Viewers that like the genre of fantasy and fantastic stories will certainly love this delightful film. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Viagem Fantstica Fantastic Voyage".

This movie is based on the book by Paul van Loon and is aimed at children aged 8 to 14. There are certain similarities with the Potterstories even though Van Loon's book was published long before Rowling's. And children do love the movie indeed. Yet this film doesn't reach the standards of the Potter movies for the budgets were obviously much smaller the special effects are clumsy and some actors terribly overact such as Onnoval's parents and the teacher. The overall acting however isn't bad. Nijholt overacts as well but in his case this is done with care and fits very well into the story. This is a lovely film for members of the targeted group and their parents will be thrilled as well when not expecting too much. It certainly is not the bad movie some people tell us it is but it is not an Oscar winning movie either.".

It may be the raciest western I've ever seen as the pair must search for clues in finding the treasure by.....looking at the butts of beautiful broads!!! Somehow it all makes sense with the story. The mighty Lo Lieh is funny at wanting to see a female's backside but it's Lee Van Cleef who keeps his personality as a solid spaghetti western star and both pair well. Plenty of gunslinging kung fu cheesecake and laughs await in this odd unusual but greatly entertaining western. This one is getting too tough to find nowadays as it hasn't been currently available again in years.

Spaghetti Western legend Lee Von Cleef plays a gunfighter and bandit who teams up with a martial arts master to recover some gold hidden by the latter's uncle before a Chinese triad or other bandits can get it. To do this they need to put together a map the uncle left which is tattooed on the backsides of his four beautiful wivesthus the Italian title which translates to something like Where the Sun Doesn't Shine. This is the funniest part of the movie because all four of the women are sexually frustrated and bitterly disappointed that the heroes are only interested in their map none of which of course is very believable. Paul Bartel would later use this exact same hilarious concept in his comedy Lust in the Dust but his actresses played Lanie Kazan and Divine were of course a little less attractive.Lee Von Cleef is pretty good here as is the unknown Chinese actor who plays his partner thankfully he's not someone like David Carradine but an actual Asian actor. The four women include Erica Blanc Patty Shepherd and Femi Benussi. Blanc was kind of wasted as usual as an actress anyway but the enigmatic Patty Shepherd an American who made her entire career in Spain and Italy always made the most of these small cameo roles her most memorable appearance was as the villainess in Paul Naschy's Werewolf Shadow where she barely logged more screen time than she does here. Femi Benussi strangely enough is the only one of the quartet who keeps her clothes on even though taking them off was pretty much her main talent. The fourth wife was played by an attractive but unknown by me anyway Chinese actress. If nothing else though all these actresses can say that in this movie they literally were just a piece of ass.Really though this movie is pretty tame and innocent both with respect to sex of which there really isn't any and violence especially compared to say Fulci's Four of the Apocalypse made a year later. I'd let my kids watch it if I had any. Definitely recommended especially to fans of Spaghetti Westerns kung fu movies and 70's Eurostarlets.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Spagnetti Western treasure hunt movie hit the bottom. By bottom I meant the whole plot of this movie by Antonio Margheriti with help from the Shaw Brothers is having a gunfighter Dakota Lee Van Cleef and a martial artist Ho Chiang Lo Lieh search for treasure by searching for tattoos marking on the bottoms of naked women. I would tap that ass of a movie! How weird is that! Still it's one over the top entertaining movie just a little crappy. That's if you can find this rare film. The movie goes by many titles from The Stranger and the Gunfighter 'East meets West to Blood Money due to the movie being translate from Italian to whatever language its being shown. The English dubbing isn't that great in my opinion. I know some of it was lost in the translation but gees the synchronization is bad. Also some of the characters English names is pretty laughable. Ho Chiang's fat bald uncle name happens to be Wang and he has four mistresses that hide his hidden long treasure. How can you not find something funny about that!? Anyways the 1970's Kung Fu craze was still in high gear but Lo Lieh isn't no Bruce Lee. The fight scenes are just awfully choreographed with over the top rewind film jumping and not even near close kicks and hits. Lo Lieh is nothing special playing the stereotypical Chinese guy who happens to be a kungFu master. At less he's a bit charming even if I can't understand what he is saying in some scenes. While not fighting random people. Ho Chiang and Dakota are chased by over the top Biblequoting madman Yancey Hobbitt Julian Ugarte and his Indian sidekick. Julian Ugarte reminds me of Roger Rees from 1993's Robin Hood Men in Tights with his delivery. He was just interesting to watch. Dressed all in black with a long leather duster gloves and wide brimmed hat looks like mix with Al Pacino and Jesus. The character is just as quick to use a gun as quote passages from the bible to any sinners he seek unfit to live his lifestyle. He has cool bad guy written all over him. While Lee Van Cleef looks pretty old in the film as his hair plug is barely hanging on his head. It really does like Lee Van Cleef is just having fun overacting. What other Western movie has the main character autograph a woman's butt? The women in the film Erika Blanc Femi Benussi Patty Shepard and Karen Yeh were pretty sexy in their roles but this film doesn't had anything more to the female characters than parading their sexy butts and had the girls sexually frustrated that men only have interest in the map. The movie makes them into young dumb female with little to no personality. If you like pointless nudity you might like this film. The music is by Carlo Savina nothing interesting. It gets annoying when the same theme plays over the action. The music sounds like some type of Blaxploitation film. The sound effects like whistles bells and whip cracks seem really canned. The print is surprisingly good considering the film's age and obscurity and fans of more lighthearted Spaghetti Westerns should be pleased. Still in some versions of the film depending if you're watching it on DVD on the internet or just had on VHS. A few scenes are missing like the basement distillery fight. Most DVDs should have this scene. Still if you don't. You're not missing much. It was badly shot anyways with it being too dark. The running time is only 102 minutes but after a while watching it it does get kinda boring due to the hammy material. The humor is hit and miss. We get forced obligatory jokes about cultural differences and confront the racism at the time. I do like the dog scene a lot. Overall this was Shanghai Noon 2000 of its day. Just a little bit more obscure lowbrow tongueincheek comedy western.".

If you look at the entertainment value alone I would say this is about on a par with Death Rides a Horse or Kid Vengeance.

Nonetheless it wins points for originality and the picture is rife with interesting characters and happenings. The print is surprisingly good considering the film's age and obscurity and fans of more lighthearted Spaghetti Westerns should be pleased. Lee Van Cleef is star material here and he hamms it up more in Blood Money than anywhere else I've seen. This really is a different performance by Van Cleef and he lets loose a refreshing side of himself that fans should enjoy. Directed by personal fave Antonio Marghereti with help from the Shaw Brothers Blood Money was essentially an exercise in blending a Kung Fu film with a Spaghetti Western and while the result is still a Eurowestern the martial arts exchanges and Eastern characters prove amply refreshing. Overall Blood Money is pretty solid although a bit sloppy and it reaches a comfortable medium between strangeness and familiarity. The story involves Van Cleef a safecracker becoming intertwined in the story of a deceased Chinese aristocrat and his missing estate. After escaping the gallows Cleef teams up with the Chinese man's nephew and the two begin their search for the uncle's missing gold. Luckily the dead man tattooed clues to his riches on the tails of four women and the unlikely pair must see each girl to unravel the mystery. There were a few parts that dragged but only briefly and we left the movie feeling pretty good. This is a solid if offbeat comedic Spaghetti Western.  Reviews by Flak Magnet".

	schema:reviewBody "No buts about it! Wang was sent by a rich Chinese warlord to California to make good investments with a large amount of gold. In the interim having acquired 4 mistresses of American Russian Italian and Chinese descent respectively he decides to tattoo partial instructions to the hidden location of the gold or whatever investments he made with the gold on the buttocks of each mistress! Thus anyone else wishing to know this location would have to obtain access to all 4 buttocks! The message within a fortune cookie later found in Wang's safe The bottom of every woman is fortune suggests that old Wang had a buttocks fetish so why he came up with this bizarre method of hiding instructions for locating his treasure. But he forgot that 4 is an unlucky number for Chinese associated with death. When safe cracker DakotaLee Van Cleef is caught ready to blow open his safe he dies in the explosion which yields only photos of the backsides of the 4 women plus the fortune cookie. As you will see in the finale old Wang was devious with respect to this fortune in more ways than one. A huge hole in the plot is the lack of a clear connection between the women's buttocks and the location of the fortune. It's merely guessed that there is based on the suggestive but far from clear message in that fortune cookie.As in a typical kung fu film there is a large surreal element with the heros at times taking on supernatural powers and with many unlikely coincidences to aid in accomplishing their goals. Having learned of the death of Wang the warlord holds all his extended family accountable for the recovery of his fortune. The responsibility for recovering it within a year is thrust upon young Ho ChiangLieh Lokung fu expert demonstrating his skill for the warlord. Upon contacting Wang's lawyer Ho obtains 1000. inheritance plus the 4 photos with the women's addresses on the back plus the fortune cookie. Learning that the safe crackerDakota responsible for his uncle's death is in the local jail Ho enters a saloon with a clear 'no Chinese' policy and is arrested for disturbing the peace in order to be put in jail so he could talk to Dakota. Released a few days later he saves Dakota from a hanging in dramatic surreal fashion and they decide to become partners in the search for the women and thereby Wang's fortune.Given the extreme antiOrientals attitude in CA in this era it's difficult to believe that Dakota would be hung for the accidental death of a Chinaman even a wealthy one!The search for the women and access to their buttocks is seldom straight forward. To find the American mistress they must track down the horsedrawn traveling churchhouse of charismatic arch villain Yancey Hobbit. Typical of classical villains he's dressed all in black including a widebrimmed hat moustache and beard. He has come to this town to extol the promotion if sinful activities then shoots several men dead as punishment for their sins while quoting bible passages! The heros gain entry to his mistress by intimidation then have to pick the lock on her chastity belt to read her message! Unfortunately this induces Yancey to question his mistress why they are interested in her bottom. She guesses it has to do with Wang's fortune. Unable to read Chinese Yancey copies down Wang's tattoo then teams with his giant Native American friend Indio to look for the other 3 mistresses. This is another huge hole in the plot. How does his mistress know there are 3 morescattered mistresses with tattoos and where they are likely found??Our heros manage to stay one step ahead of the evil duo for a while. Ho wins much money from the house gambling in the saloon where the Russian mistress is. Instead of bankrupting the owner be asks to be allowed to examine the bottom of the owner's wife. But he finds nothing remarkable as she is the twin sister of the woman he is looking for who is also present. They accomplish their goal despite the fact that her bottom is covered with autograph tattoos. To find the Italian mistress they must catch a moving train with a private car and Ho masquerades as a doctor treating her ailment with acupuncture needles in her bottom. The Chinese mistress is easy to find but Ho hesitates to ask her that day as her father is present. This gives Yancey an opportunity to kidnap her with the help of acquaintance Calico's Mexican bandit gang. Dakota is later captured trying to recover her and while locked in a room she is suspended in a cage over a fire to induce her to translate all the Chinese characters. Ho arrives later and frees Dakota for a final drawn out confrontation with the collective villains Ho taking on Indio and Dakota dealing with Yancey to finish things.I will stop here in my brief summary. I don't want to reveal the rather unexpected ironic and dramaticallypresented finale. Currently you can discover this for yourself by obtaining a copy of the 8 westerns DVD pack by Echo Bridge well worth it for a number of the films. I should add that I'm not normally a fan of Kung futype films other than Jackie Chan's nor a big fan of spaghetti westerns. However I found this hybrid of the two intriguing with a good blend of intrigue humor action and irony despite the holes in the plot.".

Dakota is later captured trying to recover her and while locked in a room she is suspended in a cage over a fire to induce her to translate all the Chinese characters. Ho arrives later and frees Dakota for a final drawn out confrontation with the collective villains Ho taking on Indio and Dakota dealing with Yancey to finish things.I will stop here in my brief summary. I don't want to reveal the rather unexpected ironic and dramaticallypresented finale. Currently you can discover this for yourself by obtaining a copy of the 8 westerns DVD pack by Echo Bridge well worth it for a number of the films. I should add that I'm not normally a fan of Kung futype films other than Jackie Chan's nor a big fan of spaghetti westerns. However I found this hybrid of the two intriguing with a good blend of intrigue humor action and irony despite the holes in the plot.";

	schema:reviewBody "Around the time this movie was made the spaghetti western was just about on its last legs. Also the craze for kung fu movies was starting to die out as well. So it must have seemed logical for the Italians and Hong Kongers to team up and make a movie that mixed both genres though this movie was not the first to do so. Though it's perhaps inevitable that a mix of genres would have mixed results. Certainly the movie has solid production values and its lighthearted nature is welcome after so many serious spaghetti westerns and kung fu epics. There's also some nudity unusual for both genres at this time. But the movie feels kind of drawn out taking its time when the pacing should have been a bit more snappy. Even more surprising is that there isn't a terrible amount of kung fu in the movie though this may have been because the choreography and direction of the martial arts fights are sub par. Also the two leads don't manage to generate that much chemistry though the language barrier might explain this. I'm not saying this is an awful movie but it is disappointing. If you want to see a good spaghetti western  kung fu mix watch The Fighting Fists Of Shanghai Joe instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "This lightweight international coproduction between Hong Kong's Run Run Shaw and Italian producer Carlo Ponti amalgamates chopsocky martial arts combat with gritty Spaghetti western violence. An Asian kung fu master teams up with an American gunslinger to find his uncle's treasure. Variously known as either Blood Money or The Stranger and the Gunfighter this tame 'East Meets West' oater is predictable but amusing nonsense. The humor that lies at the bottom of the plot is that four women have tattoos on their backsides that reveal the whereabouts of a fortune in gold. Seven Deaths in the Cat's Eye director Antonio Margheriti and scenarists Miguel De Echarri and Barth Jules Sussman have incorporated a sex comedy in this Kung FuSpaghetti western. The running joke is that our heroes must obtain permission from four women to eyeball their butts. Veteran western villain Lee Van Cleef twirls his sixgun while the often outnumbered Lo Lieh performs gravitydefying kung fu. Incidentally Lieh emerged as the first martial arts superstar before Bruce Lee.Martial arts movies were increasingly going mainstream by the early 1970s and Blood Money exemplified one of a handful of Italian westerns with Kung Fu. Not only did producer Run Run Shaw coproduce this hybrid horse opera but he also coproduced the Hammer vampire epic The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires during the same year in 1974. Mind you Blood Money premiered in Spain in 1974 but illuminated American screens two years later in 1976. Initially the Tony Anthony western The Silent Stranger should have qualified as the first 'East Meets West' Kung FuSpaghetti western. Produced in 1968 The Silent Stranger was not released by MGM until 1975 so it beat Blood Money to the draw. Earlier James Bond director Terence Young had helmed a European western with Charles Bronson as an outlaw who reluctantly joins up with Japanese samurai warrior Toshir Mifune to recover the Nippon ambassador's valuable ceremonial sword. Director Mario Caiano's Shanghai Joe 1972 followed Red Sun and concerned a Chinese immigrant Chin How Chen Lee who helps Mexican laborers from their sadistic boss. Sergio Corbucci even got into this genre in 1975 with Shoot First... Ask Questions Later 1975 as a samurai warrior helps a lawman find a treasure.Dakota Lee Van Cleef of Barquero arrives in Monterey by train. A conductor confronts our protagonist as he slips out from under the passenger coach. Before the conductor can do anything to him Dakota escapes in a cloud of steam. Breaking into the local bank Dakota picks the lock to the safe but he finds only photographs of women. Meantime one of those women alerts Wang Al Tung a short fat Asian fellow that somebody is in the bank. Wang scrambles over to the bank. Dakota relies on explosives to blow the vault. As the dynamite explodes Wang is blown off his feet. Dakota finds a fortune cookie and the photographs. He queries Wang about the contents but Wang has died. The authorities arrive and arrest Dakota. Meanwhile in Asia kung fu teacher Ho Chiang Lo Lieh of Five Fingers of Death is escorted by the warlord's troops to his headquarters. The warlord questions Ho's father about his deceased brother who left behind nothing valuable. The warlord confronts Ho. I was tricked by your uncle. Unwisely I entrusted him with a vast fortune and all he did to repay me before he died was to send me that wooden figures. The warlord indicates the statue of a noble Plains Indian chieftain. Since nobody can satisfy the warlord's curiosity he gives Ho's sister to the guards. Ho intervenes but to no avail. Nevertheless Ho's martial arts skills impress the warlord. You're brave and intelligent and I believe you can be useful in recovering my fortune he informs Ho. Find my gold in one year or all of you will  the warlord completes his sentence with a slashing motion at his throat.Ho arrives in Monterey. He meets with Wang's lawyer and learns his uncle left behind a 1000 and four photographs of women. According to the lawyer Wang's death was ruled accidental. Nevertheless the authorities sentenced Dakota to swing. The lawyer Paul Costello of Cannibal Apocalypse adds that Dakota's trial lasted several months. Not surprisingly Ho encounters racism in a saloon and defends himself against two gunslinging bouncers. The sheriff Barta Barri of Horror Express arrests Ho for hitting him. Ho lands in a cell next to Dakota. Dakota assures Ho that he didn't murder his uncle. Moreover Dakota acquired no fortune. The sheriff releases Ho. Later the Asian rescues Dakota as he stands poised on the gallows' trapdoor with his noggin in a noose. Together Dakota and Ho embark on an unusual search for Wang's four mistresses. Along the way they incur the wrath of a hypocritical preacher Yancey Hobbitt Julian Ugarte of Autopsy who wears a long black duster with a ridiculous hat. Yancey quotes scripture and wields a devastating sixgun. Yancey abducts the Chinese mistress Karen Yeh of The Iron Dragon with the aid of a Mexican bandit Ricardo Palacios of Return of the Seven and his gang. They take her to an old mission. Dakota and Ho follow. Calico captures Dakota and whips him to get information about Ho. Ho helps Dakota escape and Dakota appropriates a Gatling gun to exterminate half of Calico's gang while Ho releases the Chinese mistress. Yancey has tried to torture her to translate the tattoos.Margheriti directs with customary aplomb. Everything unfolds fluidly. Clocking in a 107 minutes Blood Money looks like a Spaghetti western but the sex comedy often undercuts the usual high body count violence. The ending may surprise those who aren't expecting it. Goliath against the Giants lenser Alejandro Ulloa gives everything a largerthanlife grandeur. Secret Agent Fireball composer Carlo Savina drums up a snappy nonwestern orchestral score. Savina's music has nothing in common with the quintessential Ennio Morricone Spaghetti western music with whistles bells and whipcracks.".

	schema:reviewBody "If numbers of titles is a good sign then things look promising for this film since I picked it up as The Stranger and the Gunfighter but when I pressed play it said la brute le colt et le karate as the title but then also said Blood Money in brackets as an alternative title but on IMDb I found it as El krate el Colt y el impostor. I came to this film because I was watching random titles from the Shaw Brothers back catalogue and suddenly found this western crossover which didn't even feature their distinctive shield on the titles even though they are listed as one of the many production companies behind it. The plot is a typical exploitation one which is trying to make the most of the popularity at the time of spaghetti westerns and also of kungfu movies in this case Ho Chiang comes to America from China to get his late uncle's money but when he arrives all he finds is some smutty photographs which gunslinger Dakota tried to rob also thinking there was money. Ho realizes that the photos are a map or rather photos of women who have the map tattooed onto their bottoms. Needing local help Ho and Dakota team up to seek the bottoms and the treasure although a deranged preacher is on their trail seeing the same thing.On the face of it this film is easy to dismiss as a cheap ripoff just looking to grab as many viewers as possible by combining genres that were selling at that time but there is nothing new under the sun and it is really no different from films like Rush Hour or Shanghai Noon with Jackie Chan partnered to an American star to bring several audiences and style together. Yes it does feel cheap but it is actually quite a lot of fun simply because it doesn't take itself too seriously. The plot is the first very obvious clue it is a hunt for bottoms but generally the tone is one of silly fun and the material generally supports this. How this humor would have played to Chinese fans I can only imagine but for me it worked pretty well as trashy entertainment. The martial arts action is very limited and they don't make the best of Lo Lieh in that sense but he is actually very good with his delivery and has good chemistry with Van Cleef. Van Cleef buys into it well even if some of his stuff is a bit silly but again he seems to be having fun.The Stranger  the Gunfighter call it what you will is not a great film. It sets its sights low but generally it does produce some genre splicing trashy fun even if it never captures what makes both genres good in their rights  this is particularly evident in the low level of martial arts action. Ultimately it is a trashy exploitation film but if you meet it on that level it is a quite fun one.".

The plot is the first very obvious clue it is a hunt for bottoms but generally the tone is one of silly fun and the material generally supports this. How this humor would have played to Chinese fans I can only imagine but for me it worked pretty well as trashy entertainment. The martial arts action is very limited and they don't make the best of Lo Lieh in that sense but he is actually very good with his delivery and has good chemistry with Van Cleef. Van Cleef buys into it well even if some of his stuff is a bit silly but again he seems to be having fun.The Stranger  the Gunfighter call it what you will is not a great film. It sets its sights low but generally it does produce some genre splicing trashy fun even if it never captures what makes both genres good in their rights  this is particularly evident in the low level of martial arts action. Ultimately it is a trashy exploitation film but if you meet it on that level it is a quite fun one.";

The charismatic young lead actor who terrorises his neighbours and family carries the film on his slight shoulders. It is cleverly structured with laughter and tears throughout. The dialogue is sharp and witty and the characters well drawn. On a more serious note the film highlights the severe problems disturbed youngsters left to their own devices can have. Another reviewer compared it to 'Home Alone' but it is much deeper and with a suicide attempt far darker than the American comedy. Filmed in Canada with French dialogue it deserves to be seen by a much wider audience. Strongly recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "There are rare time movies touch us and feel so real especially with Hollywood making us believe that everything can happen no matter what. Enter C'est pas moi je le jure. A french film about A family going through a divorce and how the children are raised with one parent looking after them. This movie not only spits in Hollywood's face but does so with grace and Honor to be so real so imaginative and so amazing.Leon is ten years old. He is not normal as he tells us. He tries to commit suicide sometimes. other times he is vandalizing his neighbours houses and he has a trait he picked up from his mom He is an amazing liar. But Leon is not the only one who's abnormal his family directly shows that as well. His mom and Dad fight constantly until they finally divorce one another. The mother leaves for Greece leaving Leon's father to watch over Leon and his older brother Jerome.Once she leaves the family falls apart Leon decides to go insane emotionally wrecking everything in his way. You feel for Leon how he acts without a mom and how he feels you get a true sense of his character and how empty he feels without her. But Leon quickly finds solace with another girl for whom he falls far. Lea. She is almost exactly like Leon in every way she is messed up none of the kids want to play with her and she and Leon are made for one another.The movie gives us so much character development and processes it rather amazingly over the 2 hours the film goes on it's one of the few movies thus far to really get a connection with your characters. Leon and Lea are not perfect they are down right evil but there intentions are pure. Leon stealing from other peoples houses to get a ticket to fly to Greece to see his mother whom abandoned him. And Lea trying to find her father who has been on a business trip for over 2 years. None of them are perfect but you still feel for them and get attached hoping for the best.By the end of the movie you smile knowing that Leon has kept one thing for himself Hope. That even though a lot has happened in his life he can change and hope for the better hope for a new change on himself hope to one day see his mother once again.The film has so much and without spoiling every little detail this is one I recommend to buy it's not a perfect film there is no such word for a film but it is unique amazing and touching. A pure gem. And the acting is done so well so real it puts to shame anything Hollywood has put together.For the reviewer who stated that this film is like Home Alone I ask this when in home alone did his parents divorce or he vandalize a whole house or cut himself and lie to to keep an alibi or even swear. This movie is nothing like Home alone this is a masterpiece and is no John Hughes family comedy this would be the Coen brothers take on Home Alone if anything.Rent it Buy it. Do whatever you can to see this film you won't be disappointed.".

I never had such luck. Honest.It's Not Me I Swear! conjures up plenty in its tale of the neighbourhood rascal who terrorizes the residents in a quaint little town in 60s Montreal and with his striped jersey that we see early on in the film one cannot help but to associate him with another boy rascal in Dennis the Menace. But this is Leon Antoine L'Ecuyer a boy with a vivid imagination and a fearless heart that when we first see him he had unwittingly hung himself on a tree swing needing his brother Jerome Gabriel Maille and mom Madeleine Suzanne Clement to bail him out of serious trouble.And when all seemed under control we slowly learn that this boy isn't quite always the helpless chap he is but a real troublemaker who doesn't hesitate to show others his middle finger whose impish grin betrays the scheming thoughts he has to do things he wants to do his way nevermind if it means stepping onto others complete with unbelievable antisocial behaviour which adds to the fun of course and you'd wonder how he manages to get away with it all. Then you realize that it's because of upbringing. Teach a child that lying is bad but lying badly is worse. Tell a child that when one has to lie one has to keep the story consistent. Leon's mom coaches him on such mantra shows the same degree of disdain and disgust for her neighbours and it's little wonder who his chief influence is. Parents out there you have been warned.It's the story of this street smart boy whose brain is fast to cook up stories and whose misplaced courage allows him to fearlessly inflict bodily pain or inconvenience onto himself if the situation or his lies call for it. It's both comical and winceinducing with situations you can both laugh and cry at the same time and you'll feel for Leon even more when his family starts to crack and deepens in their dysfunctional behaviour with the last straw being their mom walking out on the family. Chief influence and protector gone Leon retreats further into himself in some ways pining in a manner similarly seen in Danny Boyle's Millions and his stunts become a lot more daring until the narrative shifts gear to the other woman in his life that of his neighbour Lea Catherine Faucher a peer whom we are not given much background on other than a slew of suggestions and clues that she may be an abused kid.Based upon the novel by Bruno Hebert the film works because Antoine L'Ecuyer successfully carries the entire film on his shoulders and makes it believable that he's such the rascal that he is where on one hand he can look angelic to both his mom and his first love Lea while on the other the devil as he leaves a trail of destruction as he goes about prodding into other's homes armed with a screwdriver amongst other shenanigans. Curiously though director Philippe Falardeau allowed Leon to break the fourth wall at least twice to engage the audience directly and while you may have missed the first instance should you not pay attention the second one felt like a bit of a cop out to achieve what we see in the finale in what I felt had taken away the shine from an excellent build up of suspense and danger which will guarantee that you grip your seat.Winner at last year's Berlin International Film Festival walking away with the Crystal Bear for Beat Feature Film General Kplus category and the Deutsches Kinderhilfswerk Grand Prix this is one film you should not miss during its limited run at Cinema Europa. Catch it before it goes away and it waltzes early into my shortlist for one of the better films to be released this year so far. A definite recommendation!".

Only the character wise but there are plenty of differences illustrating a boy's nuisance and menace. Yeah it was about a 9 year old boy and his strange and unexpected bahaviour. Don't think in a serious manner I was saying kind of cute like the one from 'Le Petit Nicolas'.Leon is not happy for their parents' everyday fights. He thinks he can stop it if some distracting thing happened them around. So decides to try with the dangerous game and make them to blame for it. But everything he attempted goes terribly wrong and one day he also loses his beloved one. Then is main focus turn to bring her back. While preparing for it he falls in love for a neighbour girl. The mischievous boy with the series of unsuccessful event can turn everything back on track is what explained till the end.''It's better not to lie but it's worse to lie badly.''This was the movie like I desired for. An interesting and playful character is what we expect most from a kid role in an entertaining movie. The story also conveys parental negligence over kids with unorthodox character. As the story set in the late 60s the atmosphere was flawless and looked surreal. Everyone played well father mother brother and so the girl. One of the unforgettable children's movies if you are a fan of this genre. I am not going to disclose how the story ends but I will be happy if a sequel explains a few things especially the romance. With the existing end and a beautiful dialogue before the credits roll up I don't know why I thought of a followup. Maybe I am so excited to see Leon again because he was so awesome.".

The mischievous boy with the series of unsuccessful event can turn everything back on track is what explained till the end.''It's better not to lie but it's worse to lie badly.''This was the movie like I desired for. An interesting and playful character is what we expect most from a kid role in an entertaining movie. The story also conveys parental negligence over kids with unorthodox character. As the story set in the late 60s the atmosphere was flawless and looked surreal. Everyone played well father mother brother and so the girl. One of the unforgettable children's movies if you are a fan of this genre. I am not going to disclose how the story ends but I will be happy if a sequel explains a few things especially the romance. With the existing end and a beautiful dialogue before the credits roll up I don't know why I thought of a followup. Maybe I am so excited to see Leon again because he was so awesome.";

The kind of stories that noir does best were now being shown on television every night. Movies were getting bigger and splashier to compete with TV and films like the Money Trap were just not being made for theaters any more. Watching it yesterday on TCM I was struck by the ludicrousness of a letter box version for a black and white noir. By the way in 1965 television was about to go full color and black and white feature films were getting rarer each year.But even as a noir film The Money Trap has no people you really care about. Glenn Ford is married to a wealthy woman and lives in a lifestyle beyond his cop's salary. But then wife Elke Sommer gets a letter saying her late Daddy's stock won't be paying any dividends. Well golly gee we should all have such problems. It never occurs to Glenn Ford to tell Elke to tone down her extravagant ways maybe even move out of that luxurious home they have to something more modest. Ford's kind of into the good life also.During a homicide investigation involving a wealthy doctor played by Joseph Cotten who allegedly surprised a burglar in his home Ford and partner Ricardo Montalban suspect something dicey. Before expiring in the ambulance the burglar gives Ford the safe combination.Now knowing something is amiss here. Ford and Montalban decide on a robbery. Of course the doctor is smarter than the both of them put together. The whole thing ends in one bloody mess and the viewer doesn't really care.A few years later The Money Trap would have been strictly a made for TV feature if it got made at all. Probably MGM was busy trying to get rid of long time contractual obligations to Ford and Montalban. Both of them have sure done better work.But the saddest thing of all is that this is the last feature film partnership of Glenn Ford and Rita Hayworth. Rita's the best thing in this film playing a very worn out forty something exgirlfriend of Ford's and widow of the burglar Cotten shot.

Our first scene is Ford as a detective at the scene of a crime wherein a woman was hung in a whore house by her husband. Next scene we have Elke Sommer undressing to go to bed with husband Ford. This film wastes no time! But then it goes on and on with crummy characters played by William Campbell Ricardo Montalban Hayworth and Cotten. Dreary all the way to the bitter conclusion. The post'Gilda' reteaming of Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford is a sad spectacle. Ford's haircut is so bad his ears look batlike. Hayworth admittedly is not playing a glamour part but her degradation is not pleasant to watch. Together they appear dissipated like their careers at this point. Ford really seems bored and uncomfortable throughout. And Cotten is as dull as usual. But Montalban does show some energy as fellow cop and Elke Sommer has never looked better and plays the most likable maybe only likable character in the film. If that valium is making you feel too good bring yourself down with this movie.".

Glen Ford plays a fairly welltodo cop who feels pressured by his barbie doll young wife Elke Sommer to deliver even more affluence. His partner Montalban is more directly avaricious. Cotten is a corrupt doctor and a very used looking Rita Hayworth is Ford's exgirlfriend from years ago. Ford as usual underplays but nevertheless makes you feel the cold emptiness and disillusionment of the character. Everyone else delivers well but I think we have all seen these characters motivations and situations a hundred times before and the script does not give any room for interesting angles or surprises. We get a very dark literally and figuratively and gritty film but not something that is likely to grow on you. If this had been made in 1932 it would have been a far more significant film. By the mid 60s it was tired formula.".

His cowriter here was Michael Ostrowski and this combination also worked together on Nacktschnecken the prequel to this film we have here. And in both movies Ostrowski plays one of the main characters. Sadly I must say I found him pretty forgettable in both films probably the most from all the main actors. He and his buddy who share a whole lot of scenes in here never really entertained me that well and for me it was all about the pairing Detlev Buck and Georg Friedrich who had a great deal of screen time together and made this a pretty rewarding watch overall. They just play their parts really well and their characters are pretty hilarious in a good way! and the chemistry was working too. It was nice that Buck got much more screen time than he had in the first film.The latter is also one of the reasons why I believe that this sequel is better than the original film and the good thing is the story is so different here that it has hardly anything to do with the original film at all. You certainly don't need to have seen the 2004 film to appreciate 2009 movie. This one we have here is also a bit longer runs for over 90 minutes. It is the story of a bag that seems to contain something mysterious apparently very precious. And as everybody tries not to make sure the bag arrives at the target destination we get to see an interesting road? movie that takes us on many locations and I also liked the focus on characters here. There are not too many in the center of it all but just enough and the minor supporting players stay memorable too despite only having two or three scenes perhaps like the Indian guy. I think you should check this out. I can see why people consider it one of the best Austrian films in recent years. Thumbsup from me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Firstly let me mention that this is my first IMDb post ever and I feel compelled to make this post based on many different things. I went into this movie with no prior knowledge other than a trailer of the movie where michael cera gets berries knocked out of his hands etc. The scene made me laugh and I thought that Jack Black and Cera could be a good pairing for a comedy. I did not know that the movie was directed by Harold Ramis nor that the script was written by Ramis as well as the guys from The Office all three of whom are comedy geniuses nor did I know that the movie had been panned by Roger Ebert the only movie critic whom i actually respect in that we have very similar taste in movies. If I had read the Ebert review 1 star I probably wouldn't have gone to see the movie but nonetheless I did. There are two kinds of comedy comedy with a moral to the story and mindless comedy for the sole purpose of making people laugh. This is the latter but it is done to perfection. I'm not going to talk about the movie itself other than to say that the scenes with Oliver Platt and Cera had me laughing as hard as the first half hour of Borat i.e. I could barely breathe. I'm not claiming that this movie is a classic in fact I'll admit that there was no real point to the movie and the philosophical bits fell pretty flat but all in all there were many scenes in this movie where Ramis' genius is apparent. I went to the movie to get some laughs and I definitely got my moneys worth. For a quick example of some other comedies which had me leaving a large amount of pee for theatre personnel to mop up later A Fish Called Wanda...The Holy Grail Office Space Borat Austin Powers Happy Gilmore. OK I didn't see most of these in the theatre but you get the point. I can't really say why so many people are panning Year One. My only thought is that they really just don't get the humor. Obviously there is a plentiful supply of people on IMDb that will not like this notion since they couldn't possibly be wrong about anything but in my opinion they are mistaken when it comes to this movie. I have a feeling that people's opinions of this movie will change in time. Is it possible that a pointless cave man comedy could be before its time? I hope this post will get a few more people to watch this movie with an open mind.".

I figured it was going to drag on from there. To my great relief it did not at all. The entire hour and a half of the movie was constant laughing. The way Black and Cera got themselves into so much trouble and managed to get out of it every time was perfect. The ridiculous yet hilarious references to The Bible and how things that exist today were created were perfect. The movie was exactly what it was supposed to be a laugh out loud comedy that was only meant to entertain.I am still baffled as to why people keep bashing this movie. Comments like Worst Movie of the Decade anger me... What were people expecting with this movie? A heart warming story with a compelling plot and serious action? It is like everybody is sizing this movie up to expectations that it doesn't need to be sized up to. This movie was a great movie if all you want to do is go in and laugh. If you are looking for some deeper moral and other things that don't belong in a movie like Year One you should go and see something else.".

However if you like your comedy layered upon multiple levels of meaning and embedded within a historical and philosophical context and you're knowledgeable enough to get jokes based upon middle eastern mythology and the slow ascent of enlightenment you will love this movie.The film starts with our Main Men Oh and Zed Cera and Black embedded in a basic huntergatherer culture. Only problem is Oh and Zed are modern humans with our selfawareness and ironic detachment surrounded by wildstate humans. The natural humans are powerful and fit but a little lacking in philosophy.After a close encounter with the Tree of Knowledge Zed and Oh are exiled by their closeminded band and strike out for the Big City and Modern Times. They soon encounter the Hebrews and this is where our own closedminded theatregoers get their panties in a bunch. We meet Abraham preparing to sacrifice Isaac Cain slaying Abel and the ridiculous absurdity of Old Testament morality. Modern day fundies have a sense of humor chiseled in stone like the Ten Commandments and this movie breaks them all.Unfortunately the innocence of the huntergatherers has also been lost by this time. They have been captured by civilization and sold into slavery and now Zed and Oh have a mission rescue their damsels in distress Maya and Eema from slavery in Sodom.Fortunately Isaac in a hilarious portrayal of the Jewish Badboy by Chris MintzPlasse  that's McLovin to youguides them to Sin City where our heroes are quickly introduced into the complexities of modern politics. The power structure of the city is tyrannical and corrupt ruled by a rotten king his hilariously corrupt High Priest and the scheming Prime Minister.By the end of the film Oh and Zed and Maya and Eema who are also very funny in supporting roles have traversed the philosophical arc from instinctive animals through corrupt theocracy and finally end up peering through the keyhole of enlightenment. The humor is a little too smart and sacrilegious for some viewers but for most it is an excellent comedy. I laughed my ass off and never missed it.".

It is as much a nod to JudeoChristian history as it also pans it. It is a nod to Mel Brooks without being a complete copy cat of Mr. Brooks.

Jack can't hunt or gather but he eats from the tree of knowledge and both are banished into the world. David Cross plays Cain who is the first person they meet and actually plays someone closer to his stand up act than Tobias David and Michael would have worked together on Arrested Development but David shows that he can actually play another character.They go from one biblical setting to another making fun mainly of the old testament and eventually wind up in Sodom with Cain and the requisite love interests....I think where this movie falls down is it seems a bit like a long skit. The chemistry between Jack Black and Michael Cera I thought wasn't great but the plotcharacter development was really just secondary to getting in some jokes. Obviously the jokes won't be to everyones taste hence the rankings of 0 and will be to others thus the rankings of 10.Again although this may very well win a Razzie this year I liked it and if you like stupid humor this movie has lots of it.".

Oliver Platte as the high priest is great and of course Jack Black is great as well. If you come to this thinking that your going to see the greatest movie of all time with the best plot ever written then your not going to get it but come on what would you expect with a movie like this. It's fing hilarious and you'll really enjoy getting the opportunity to laugh out loud for 90 minutes then go see this.".

There are plenty of scenes that will give you laughs that pass as abruptly as they come and a few that are longer lasting. From crude sexual humor to semiintelligent humor this film targets younger audiences that can look at religion in a comedic light. Most of the jokes for this film are at the expense of the Jewish and Christian religion. By no means is this a proper history lesson for anyone and shouldn't be viewed by ages 15 and under without parental permission. That said it is a funny film throughout. If you enjoy buddy films this one will deliver especially if you are out with friends who enjoy seeing Jack Black's high energy humor and Micheal Cera's awkward teenager humor as they are pretty much in every scene.".

However as you cringe watching the toilet humor scenes you get sideswiped by a few clever jokes that are timed just right.There are a few jokes in the movie that are delivered so perfectly with such great nuance and skill that just thinking about them still makes me laugh.

The plot was very contrived and the historical humour fizzled out after the first twenty minutes. The rest of the movie relied on a myriad of sexual innuendos that were overused and abused.

	schema:reviewBody "OK first let's take a quick paragraph to analyze the history of successful comedy duos. There's Abbot  Costello a simpleminded clown Costello and his moreintelligent straitlaced keeper Abbott. Then there's Martin  Lewis another simpleminded clown Lewis and his more intelligent suave keeper Martin. Laurel  Hardy same formula. Mork  Mindy Laverne  Shirley Ren  Stimpy the list goes on. This successful pattern with minor variations repeats itself through the years. The clown is always kept in line by hisher more intelligent  responsible keeper.Here we have a switcheroo. With Black  Cera the idiot Jack Black is in charge while the smart one Cera is taking orders. The dynamic especially with the extreme opposite personalities of Black  Cera outgoing vs. introverted is a riot. Both are equally hilarious and when they play off each other it can be downright asphyxiating. I can't believe that this is the only film that features the two of them together like this but that alone makes Year One worth running out to see.Apparently critics haven't been kind to this movie. I've read the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and almost all of the negatives harp on how this doesn't stand up to writerdirector Harold Ramis's past hits like Caddyshack Vacation Ghostbusters etc. So what? Beethoven's 9th symphony may not have been as powerful as his 5th but we still like it.Year One delivers some great laughs period. Beginning in what seems to be caveman times but quickly shifting into Old Testament Biblical times it takes us on a wild romp through episodes of Cain  Abel Abraham  Isaac Sodom  Gomorrah and a particularly boyhungry high priest played by Oliver Platt you will NEVER recognize him. Irreverent yes. Funny yes. Offensive I doubt it. Not any more than History of the World Part 1 or Monty Python's Holy Grail. Definitely less biting than Life of Brian. But it does pack some bite.The story isn't particularly new but it serves its purpose to serve as a vehicle for some witty gags. And again I must harp on the BlackCera delivery that makes it work. Jack Black plays an inept loudmouthed hunter who is constantly coming up with stupid ideas that get them in big trouble. Cera plays a meek gatherer who follows along with everything quietly trying to explain the idiocy of it all while being ignored. The comedy flows so naturally you'd think it was all improvised like in a Christopher Guest film. But I read in an interview that there wasn't much improv at all. Just a carefully planned script and excellent delivery.The comedy is mostly familyfriendly but there are some adult innuendos and suggestive gags that may cross the line on occasion. If you  your family feel comfortable laughing about circumcisions then hey no problem.Although similar in theme I would never compare Year One to History of the World or Holy Grail. Instead the comedy reminds me more of The Rocker with Rainn Wilson playing a washedup 80s metal drummer trying to survive in a band today or maybe even Men in Black odd as that may seem.There are rumors that Black  Cera may have parts in Ramis's upcoming Ghostbusters III and if so I'll definitely run out and see it. Until then Year One remains your only chance to experience this oneofakind matchup. Don't miss out.".

I didn't go to see it on the opening night and then having read all of the bad reviews here on IMDb I was pretty put off fearing that this is one of those movies that don't live up to a great trailer. But I went anyway and was not disappointed. Maybe I enjoyed it so much because I brought along low expectations a light mood and had Haagen Dazs just before the flick. On the bright side Year One is riddled with humor some jokes being funnier than others and yes as other reviewers have pointed out some of the jokes are drawn out. Jack Black is admirably suited for the role of the antihero Zed a sort of Judah Friedlander caveman who fails at everything he does but fails so well. And Michael Cera the effeminate Oh is another manifestation of wise casting. Who better to play the virgin gatherer than Cera? At times the movie is not gripping and the trailer is a bit misleading since it gives the impression that the movie would be mostly about cavemen meeting Romans with few biblical allusions. But the entire movie is nearly a parody about the bible in which another explanation is offered for some of the miracles of the Old Testament. The moments when the movie is dull are few and the dialog and characterization make up for it. Zed remains faithful to his inadequate antihero character throughout and Oh keeps getting into worse trouble as he had since the beginning. This is actually one of the best parts in which every time Zed gets himself and Oh into trouble Oh is the one to suffer the worse punishment. In any case if you want to enjoy this movie go with a light heart and just try not to take it too seriously.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the reviews this movie seemed like it would be horribly bad and full of annoying cringe worthy moments but this is not true at all. Actually despite a lazy script full of nonstop crude and sex jokes and moments that could be really awful this movie is above the very low bar. Jack Black and Michael Cera take this bad material and make something mediocre out of it which still isn't saying much.Zed Jack Black is a gatherer who tries to fit in with the hunter clan but he's just too silly for their tastes. Oh Michael Cera is also a gatherer and is a somewhat unpopular with the ladies. After an accident involving fire this mismatched pair has to leave and they do through various pieces of biblical history including meeting Cain David Cross and Abel Paul Rudd and meeting Isaac Christopher MintzPlasse and Abraham Hank Azaria who apparently had a thing for cutting foreskin. The movie is a hodge podge of scenes thrown together with very little plot but by the end Zed and Oh have to save the lives of two girls from their village.Jack Black and Michael Cera are pretty good here. Jack Black does his typical over the top stoner performance and Michael Cera gives the emotional boy performance. Even David Cross and Oliver Platt manage to squeeze some laughs out of their performances. But nobody really has a lot of material to work with though at the same time the material isn't the worst out there. It's bad and oftentimes relies on some outwardly sexual material. In fact this is the least subtle PG13 rated film I've seen where sexual or crude jokes are involved. This includes scenes of eating poop and throwing testicles. If something sexual happens it's not only just implied but it's flaunted.One big problem is the lack of plot in the movie. It grows boring going from setpiece to setpiece never establishing a real plot until the end and despite being only around 100 minutes it still feels way too long. The climax is ridiculous and quite boring and this movie is too filled with scenes that aren't particularly horrible but they aren't particularly funny and all too often this movie is just a laugh free staring at the screen. It managed to attain quite consistent mediocrity with some chuckles every once in a while. It wasn't horrible it just wasn't good either by any means.My rating  out of . 105 mins. PG13 for crude sexual humor drug use and language.".

PG13 for crude sexual humor drug use and language.";

	schema:reviewBody "Jack Black and Michael Cera playing themselves yeah where was that even considered funny? Now I absolutely adore these actors Michael was a great choice in Superbad and Juno and Jack Black has proved he can do great comedy like Tropic Thunder and a good dramatic role like King Kong even a more calm character like he played in The Holiday. But the main problem? They have no chemistry! You have this wild outgoing maniac who is eating poopeeeew! and the calm awkward overly shy nerd who pees on himselfeeew! and what do you have? Every elementary school joke that could be put into a movie Year One could have been written by a five year old and proves that top list actors will do anything for those millions that they make.Jack Black and Michael Cera headline Harold Ramis' Biblical comedy about a pair of misfit huntergatherers who embark on a wild journey through the ancient world after being banished from their primitive village. Zed and Oh may lack in the skills that their chieftain is looking for but they have plans to make it big. Zed has a gut feeling that God has chosen him and so he leads his buddy on a trip through the unknown countryside in search of bigger and better things bumping into several weird characters along the way  like a feuding pair of brothers named Cain and Abel. Unfortunately their quest for greatness hits a few snags like being sold into slavery and later becoming the object of interest to a very amorous very hairy high priest in the opulent city of Sodom.You have to understand I wanted to love this movie from the minute that I saw the trailer I thought this was going to be such a great movie but once again they showed all the funny parts in the trailer. During the movie I fell asleep and my boyfriend tried to wake me up and I said OMG I was dreaming that I was watching this movie where Jack Black and Michael Cera think that they're funny oh no just let me sleep. Seriously this movie was beyond painfully bad I don't understand how anybody could find this kind of humor funny. Year One has everything that should equal a good comedy and that was the funny cast but thanks to the bad direction and awful concept Year One falls completely flat. Stay as far away from this trash as you can this film should be used only to torture possible terrorists into telling the US where they hide their nuclear weapons.110".

	schema:headline " A laughfilled review of ancient history grass shacks to gilded palaces in 97 minutes";
	schema:reviewBody "Year One is a broad but quickwitted costume comedy by Harold Ramis who wrote Animal House and directed 'Caddyshack' and 'Groundhog Day'. The American critics aren't happy with it though if Monty Python had made it which isn't impossible they'd be a whole lot more enthusiastic. 'Life of Brian' and 'Apocalypto'were both inspirations. Ramis succeeds very well in his purpose which is to entertain and make us laugh. There's a range in the humor from the crude to the subtly satirical. Ramis dips lower than the Brits and doesn't fly as high but there's some wit and for a few moments the Old Testament gets taken for a bracingly wild ride. The basic joke well emphasized in the colloquial dialogue is the contrast between the modern sensibility of the two protags and the ancient settings they roam through.Ramis gets off to a good start by combining the crude boisterous Jack Black and the dry fey Michael Cera as buddies from a stoneage tribe they make a good contrast Black's invincible confidence set off against Cera's restraint and exquisite timing. Zed Black and Oh Cera are outcast members of a huntergatherer village Zed is full of bravado daring to sample the apple of the tree of knowledge for all the good it does him which is none but still a totally incompetent hunter. Oh is a multitalented gatherer the smartest guy in town though as he says that's a low bar. Oh was the one who thought of using gourds to drink out of instead of cupping one's hands it just seemed practical. Oh and Zed Cera and Black provide a running series of jokes about masculinity and intelligence throughout. Ramis has fun with Cera's girlish voice and soft face. He's still the smartest guy around  and also a big guy towering above squat plump Jack. Oh's also unmistakably interested in girls proclaiming himself to be a male virgin a status he is aiming to lose. But his looks mean he has to watch out for Zaftig the bald eunuch Kyle Gass and the flaming hirsute high priest of Sodom Oliver Platt.Dramatically different levels of civilization coexist in Ramis' ancient times as they do now. 'Year One' is a quick runthrough of some early stages of human history. The neolithic pals quickly run into some farmers with domesticated animals who turn out to be a nastily squabbling Cain and Abel and some mean Biblical fun begins leading from fratricide to the discovery of the tiresome old blowhard Abraham. His son Isaac Christopher MintzPlasse of 'Superbad' whom they save from being sacrificed emerges as a rebellious potsmoking teenager who likes to sneak off to Sodom to party as what teenager wouldn't?. When Zed and Oh hears about this sink of depravity they can't wait to go there themselves despite Abraham's condemnation. Anyhow they have to escape Abe's clutches before he circumcises them a new idea they don't particularly fancy.Things go on in this vein. A lot of the action takes place in Sodom. The Old Testament Hebrews are just a stopover on the way though they pop up again later. It's a wild ride for Zed and Oh who go from wearing animal skins to giving oil massages and losing their virginity backstage at a palace revolt. That elaborately staged scene the budget was 60 million shows Ramis shot this more like a Biblical blockbuster than a pennypinching Python flick and the changing costumes and hair styles are fun. But I'll be honest with you. Jack Black is wearing a bit thin metaphorically that is and it's chiefly Cera with his casual throwaway delivery of the best lines who breathes freshness into this.".

It is a great premise for a movie but it fails to deliver many laughs it is basically one of those all the funny parts are in the trailer movies and was I think a really wasted opportunity for what could have been a very funny film. Jack Black is okay doing his usual act and Michael Cera is very good in his typical straight man role but the laughs don't exactly come flowing through. There are a couple of very good cameo appearances in the movie I don't want to spoil the surprise and they help to make up for the overall poor quality of the rest of the film. Worth seeing probably but definitely not at the movies for 12.".

As expected Jack turned is his normal I can't act I can just do this one personality performance. As expected his character is crude idiotic and believes himself to be a genius Casanova I dare you to name any character he has played that this does not describe. Micheal Cera whom I am told is an actual actor left me unconvinced. Neither character managed to be likable or show any character growth throughout the story not one inch of growth or shred of wisdom. I suppose its too much to ask when both characters have names that mean zero. As with most Jack Black films it claims to be comedy but the jokes are old enough to draw social security benefits and the sight gags won't appeal to anyone over the age of 13 or so. To me the funniest moment of the film is when Zed is getting the snot beaten out of him. If you like repetitive jokes and toilet humor look no further if you want anything resembling real entertainment look elsewhere.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bruno is coming in 3 weeks Bruno is coming in 3 weeks. That's a little chant you can soothe your head with if you so happen to go through the misfortune of watching Year One. About as detestable a movie as anyone could imagine one wonders why Sony decided to screen it for critics to begin with and wonders even more why they couldn't at least show us something afterwards to erase it completely from our memories. It's bad. It's really really really bad. It's unimaginable that a worse movie could possibly come out this year. Harold Ramis the man who directed Caddyshack and Groundhog Day for crying out loud what has happened to you? What did the movie audience do to you to deserve this movie? The only funny thing about it is that a competent person directed it that people who have been funny before starred in it and yes even funny people wrote it.The story centers around tribal nitwits Zed Jack Black and Oh Michael Cera two guys living in the year one who can neither hunt nor gather and so are thrown out of their community of Neanderthals and dung n' stick huts. No matter. For the two have eaten of the forbidden fruit and are now curious about what lay outside of their limited little world and so they embark on a journey through the ancient world. On their travels they meet Cain David Cross and Abel Paul Rudd Abraham Hank Azaria and Isaac ChristopherMintz Plasse and they wind up in Sodom where their girlfriends Juno Temple and June Diane Raphael have been turned into slaves and are about to be sacrificed by the high priest Oliver Platt. None of this really matters as it's all just set up for a lot of bits that are flawlessly unfunny.It's safe to say that Ramis has gone from rusty his previous directorial effort was 2005's The Ice Harvest to downright awful. He along with coscreenwriters Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg two guys who are part of the creative think tank on The Office craft a complete trainwreck of a film that falls back on everything that's wrong with American comedy. It settles for lowest common denominator and aims lower. Poop is eaten a character hanging upsidedown pees and lets it trickle down his face testicles are thrown genital mutilation is referenced and fart and vomit jokes are painfully added to this crude and all together embarrassingly sloppy and unfunny stew of crap. And this is the Amaterial. The movie also tries to riff on the bible as much as possible hitting on everything from forbidden fruit to slaves to temples of death. It's all just a lot of rambling with no punchlines. Ramis and co. are going for a little bit of Mel Brooks a little bit of Seinfeld and a little Monty Python just they fail miserably at all three. The only thing that comes close to funny and worth referencing is a looney slapstick fight between Cain and Abel that later keeps getting hammered to death through repetition.And Jack Black is just insufferable in this kind of scenario. His brand of comedy is the hyperactive offtherails take everything to about a level 10 type that's worked well for him in movies like School of Rock and Tropic Thunder but with sub par material he is in fact a far belowirritating comic actor who just grates on you in every scene. And Michael Cera is doing his regular dorky hangdog shtick here and that's another problem with the movie in general. These two spend time mugging and doing their own improv basically being themselves rather than the characters. They're both too modern to actually be believable in these roles. And most of the woman characters are too modern too. One mentions she's a lesbian. Another mentions that God may be a woman. Both seem to center on feministic principles that in year one might get a woman into a lot of trouble. Lastly as if this movie doesn't try hard enough to work gross we have to watch a hairy effeminate Oliver Platt get oil rubbed on him in yet another scene that screams for laughs but only gets more groans. Please for the love of God no Year Two.For more reviews check out Leesmovieinfo.com".

And most of the woman characters are too modern too. One mentions she's a lesbian. Another mentions that God may be a woman. Both seem to center on feministic principles that in year one might get a woman into a lot of trouble. Lastly as if this movie doesn't try hard enough to work gross we have to watch a hairy effeminate Oliver Platt get oil rubbed on him in yet another scene that screams for laughs but only gets more groans. Please for the love of God no Year Two.For more reviews check out Leesmovieinfo.com";

I saw people comment that some jokes were offensive.. What? Those of you simply do not know what comedy is and you can't base your opinion of how fun this WHOLE movie is on one joke..If you see this movie now do it with no prejudice at all.

This presents particular challenges as the vampires' food supply  human blood  is dwindling and rationing is now the norm. There is growing evidence that vampires deprived of an adequate blood supply are themselves evolving into wild vile creatures that attack anyone and anything in order to survive. Dr. Edward Dalton a vampire and hematologist who works for a pharmaceutical firm has been working on finding an artificial blood supply that will meet the vampire society's needs. He is sympathetic to humans and sees his work as a way of alleviating their suffering but his views on finding a solution change considerably when he meets someone who found a way to transform himself from being a vampire to again take human form.";

	schema:reviewBody "Saw 'Daybreakers' at Piccadilly today. Been curious ever since i saw the trailers and being an Ethan Hawke fan decided to check it out anyway. The film started out on a bloody brilliant note. The scenes conveying the nearextinction of the human race and how the vampires are taking over and how the vampires themselves are threatened by the blood shortage issue was done rather effectively and the audience seemed to love it. There is a sense of foreboding throughout the film which can be expected in the genre but nevertheless is very vital to it as most films fall short here. Daybreakers is not your typical clichridden vampire horror. There has obviously been some sensible writing involved here. But towards the end the screenwriter tends to lose his grip and throws in some regular scenes just for the sake of cheap thrills and gore. This for me did take a bit away from the essence of the film especially considering the rest of the film was greatBut nevertheless I would recommend this film as there is much to be enjoyed. The cinematography and colour combos and contrasts have been created masterfully. Even most of the cgi seems credible enough. Ethan Hawke is his usual intense self and Sam Neil resurfaces into the mainstream with a Batmansounding villain character. But its William Defoe as one of the folks with the crossbows who gets the best lines in the film. Sample this  a human in a world of vampires is about as safe as barebacking a five dollar whore!Could have been a great vampire flick a genre defining one but is reduced to merely a good one. But that isn't too bad considering the amount of vampire dung we were dished out for the entirety of 09. This one is the best of the lot! Cheers".

	schema:reviewBody "In the near future a batborne plague has turned 99 of the human population into vampires. The remaining humans are hunted down and farmed for blood by a corporation headed by Charles Bromley Sam Neill an individual who views vampirism as a miracle since he was dying before the plague broke out. There aren't many humans left though and when a vamp goes without blood they turn into grotesque Nosferatu variants called subsiders. Bromley enlists his top hematologist Ethan Hawke to come up with a blood substitute but an underground band of surviving humans has a different resolution in mind.This film has a unique premise and for the first hour or so I thoroughly enjoyed exploring the world that Michael and Peter Spierig created. The opening scene shows one of the downsides of vampirism as a girl takes her life rather than be stuck in a child's body for eternity. There were other fun touches thrown in too like blood coming in wine bottles and being poured over ice. The film's storyline touches on themes of corporate greed taking precedent over the good of the public and there is an underlying oil subtext that is less than subtle.The second half turns into a clichd mess. The ending in particular is really cheesy as a result. Truthfully I would have been happy if the whole band of humans idea had been scrapped entirely. Surely they could've come up with something a little better. I mean this is a pretty creative film. Other segments of the picture seem rushed like the subplot involving Bromley's daughter. Speaking of Bromley Sam Neill is one of my favorite actors so it was great seeing him in a genre film again. His presence is the highlight of Daybreakers. I've never much cared for Hawke and his performance here did nothing to change my mind. Willem Dafoe also pops up and while I usually do like him his character here is annoying.As is chalk it up as a movie that could've been more. Oh well at least it's way better than the last work from the Spierigs Undead. That was one of the rare films that I stopped watching halfway through. Quick note I saw a father and two young teens leave shortly after an early scene involving a gory testing of the blood substitute. Guess they thought this would be another Twilight.".

Hundreds and hundreds of films dating back as far as 1909's Vampire of the Coast have explored the undead that sprout fangs that walk among us at night. Over the past years vampire film and television production has gone into high gear. From Twilight to The Vampire Diaries to True Blood if you are looking for bloodsuckers you don't have to search very far. The challenge most writers and filmmakers are faced with therefore is making a vampire film seem fresh and inventive.The Blade series did a good job in the 1990's pitting vampire against vampire. 30 Days of Night was genius in having the vampires travel to the one place on earth where the sun doesn't appear for months at a time. And Let The Right One In was a foreign gem that surely ranks as one of the genres best.But writerdirectors Michael and Peter Spierig The Undead had a new idea. What if in the future the world is dominated by vampires instead of humans. And what if with so few humans left the blood supply that vampires need to survive becomes scarce.Enter Daybreakers the new film by the Spierig brothers that stars Willem Dafoe Sam Neill and Ethan Hawke. Daybreakers takes place in the year 2019. The world is not all that different from what it is now. People still drive cars and go to work. There are businessmen policemen and even homeless with signs around their neck asking for people to donate blood. What is different is that all these professions and people are vampires. Humans are in short supply and when captured they are harvested for their blood. Humans are so scarce in fact that they account for less than 5 of the population and the blood supply that vampires need to survive has less than a months left in reserve. If a vampire begins to starve he turns into a hideous creature. A monster that cannot reason or communicate and preys on humans and vampires alike.Scientists are hard at work trying to find a synthetic blood or solution to their problem. Lead by Edward Ethan Hawke the team is on the brink of solving the international shortage. Edward is a conflicted vampire. As both a scientist and a human sympathizer Edward wishes for the simpler times long before the vampire outbreak.By chance Edward crosses paths with a group of fleeing humans lead by Audrey Bennett Claudia Karvan. After Edward helps them escape their vampire stalkers Audrey introduces him to Elvis Williem Dafoe  a former vampire that has miraculously converted back to human.Just how Elvis was able to adapt back to human form takes about a quarter of the film wherein Edward works with Elvis to understand and then to do a vampire trial on the process found successful.All the while the vampire police army and the conglomerate lead by Charles Bromley Sam Neill that wants to harvest the humans are quickly in toe with only daylight stopping them from their ultimate goal.Daybreakers was good intelligent fun with blood splatter and jumpoutofyourseat moments that are lacking in horror films today. The Spierig brothers have done an exceptional job of taking the conventional vampire film and turning it into something new and fresh. They have plenty of moments where they go for the jugular but if you were to take their story and replace human blood with oil you can argue it is a social commentary on how humans would react when cut off their most valued resource.Plenty of action  including some cool car chase scenes  and at least 10 jumpoutofyourseat moments Daybreakers delivers on bringing a bloody good story packed with severed limbs chopped off heads and of course the burning of vampire skin when exposed to sunlight.Those horror conventions aside Daybreakers brings air to the deflated genre and keeps the Spierig brothers as two to watch in the upcoming years.".

After a plague sweeps across the globe turning men women and children into bloodthirsty pale version of their former selves another larger threat looms.

The attention to detail at every turn is the greatest reason to seek out Daybreakers even if script and some performances aren't quite up to the same standard. Take for example instances of how the vamps navigate during the daytime and what a doubledouble coffee now means. Many earmarks of vampire lore remain death by sunlight susceptibility to a steak in the heart etc. But many details about the new world culture is left to viewer imagination which is a far better avenue to take then attempting to stuff the story with exposition and revelations.Amidst a sea of flashy set pieces the acting takes a backseat. Hawk is merely there Dafoe is entertaining enough and scores most of the laughs and Sam Niell shows up as the shady CEO of the blood farm and is sufficiently sinister. The real standout is Claudia Karvan as one of the remaining humans who actually manages to bring down her languid looking costars with her emotion and charm. Daybreakers features a number of requisite action setpieces and do the job admirably enough but it is the story that is the real reason to see this film.If there is still blood to be drained from this waning horror genre I hope it is not fasttracked to take advantage of the current craze.

	schema:headline " Good bloody fun";
	schema:reviewBody "There is no shortage of on screen vampires these days. However 'Daybreakers' scores with a unique twist in what is becoming an overworked genre What if the undead are the majority? In 2019 due to a plague most of the world's population have become vampires and the few humans left are hunted down and farmed for blood. This topsyturvy new normal is sharply and amusingly depicted as being eerily similar to current living with the important difference that the populace go about their business at night and enjoy shots of blood in their coffee. Aging famine and disease have been eradicated however sunlight is lethal. There is also still a class system with destitute vampires who cannot afford a regular fix of blood turning into violent deformed creatures called subsiders.But there is a problem. The vampires' insatiable appetite for blood has driven the residual human population to the point of extinction and left the blood supply almost exhausted. Enter Edward Dalton Ethan Hawke a scientist working for a massive pharmaceutical conglomerate headed by the evil Charles Bromley Sam Neill. His job is to find a blood substitute to ward off mass starvation. Dalton secretly sympathizes with the remaining humans and hopes that his work will result in their persecution being halted. After connecting with some human survivors he realizes that there may be an even more radical solution to the problem. However not every solution is profitable..From beginning to end this film is big gory fun. There are some interesting and agreeable plot twists and the film's more metaphorical aspects which are not exactly subtle to begin with are upfront but not preachy. The special effects and action scenes are topnotch also particularly a gruesome setpiece near the film's climax. The Spierig brothers also manage to insert some big scary jolts at regular intervals. All the cast are solid but special mention should go to Sam Neill who does not chew scenery as the main villain of the piece but definitely nibbles here and there. Willem Dafoe is good too as always. Daybreakers also passes a key horror movie test when you leave the theater the outside world does not look quite as reassuring as it normally does. Well worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Daybreakers is a superbly fresh and entertaining vampire experience. The film takes place in a dystopian future only a decade from now in which an outbreak in vampirism has turned the known world on its head. Contrary to the typical vampire film setup vampires make up the majority of the world's population here and humans who are either being framed for blood or are in hiding make up only around 5. In a way the setup somewhat reminds me of the film Equilibrium with vampires added into the mix.The film finely balances scifi horror and action and I also really appreciated the utter desperation present in the film. So many action movies go so overthetop in their action heroes that you never feel like their in any danger of being defeated but here all odds are against our protagonists and as events unfold their situation grows gloomier and gloomier.The entire castwhich includes Ethan Hawke Sam Neill William Dafoe and Claudia Karvanis on top of their game here and play the material straight which is very refreshing. Especially Sam Neill whom I've always been a fan of since I saw Jurassic Park as a kid is great here and he really manages to steal the show in his scenes.Also refreshing is the amount of bloodletting and thematic material present here. Make no mistake Daybreakers is a hard 'R' and full of violence and grotesque sites like starving vampires turning into monstrosities that are hard to look at. The film also had ideas and much to say about a struggling society in the face of low supply to meet high demand.I wasn't a huge fan of Undead but the Spierig Brothers have truly crafted something special here. I do wish the film was a bit longer as I wanted to know more about the society the story took place in but that's a testament to the film itself. If you're seeking a more adult vampire film with enough substance to excuse its style I recommend Daybreakers.Related Recommendations Equilibrium Gattaca They Live Aeon Flux  Blade Blade II The Matrix".

	schema:reviewBody "I attended the World Premiere of Daybreakers at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Like many genre films being screened here it's another fascinating hybrid  let's call this one vampire scifi action adventure.This Australian horror film is it something in the water? was written and directed by brothers Michael and Peter Spierig the very same filmmakers who closed down the legendary Uptown Theatre in Toronto with Undead in 2003. That made this a homecoming of sorts. In fact it turns out they'd been working on Daybreakers since that very day.It's 2019 and there's been a role reversal  the world is populated primarily by vampires. Humans are now a hunted minority and an essential food source  think Alien meets Soylent Green. Charles Bromley Sam Neill is the head of a megacorporation which reaps hefty profits off the arrangement. Ethan Hawke plays Edward chief blood researcher. Later we'll meet outlaw Elvis Willem Dafoe. His role here becomes more pivotal as the story progresses but I'll leave it at that.All are up to the task but despite the presence of veterans Neill Hawke and Dafoe Daybreakers is still storydriven and would be less effective if not for an ingenious plot filled with unexpected turns and nonstop action that had me on the edge of my seat literally. The script is laden with unpredictable twists and shocking reveals that will surprise viewers. Horrific mutant creatures appear out of nowhere with perfect timing.The brothers Spierig take a thorough handson approach involving themselves in many of the technical aspects along with writing and directing. Ben Nott's sweeping cinematography and crisp editing by Matt Villa helps fulfill their vision of a dark world in which the protagonists are often difficult to identify.Groundbreaking visual and special effects often elicited cheers from the audience here. I was wideeyed from start to finish witnessing some of the most jawdropping stunts and shocking kills I've seen in a genre film. The color palette is essential to the story as of course the undead can only come out at night. Since most shots are necessarily interiors or in darkness pushing the blue reflects the bleak lighting conditions under which the population lives as well as the washedout appearance of what we imagine vampires look like. As in most genre movies sound is as essential to the story as are characters and composer Christopher Gordon's masterful score matches up with the brilliant work of the effects team to punctuate the many intense action sequences.Michael and Peter Spierig attended the screening along with Willem Dafoe and Sam Neill. The QA ran well into the early morning hours.NOTE Daybreakers was the runnerup for the Midnight Madness Cadillac People's Choice Award".

We walk talk and do as we used to do. The major difference being that we must obviously drink blood and avoid the sun. Thus any and all humans are captured and farmed for blood until the day they die. We have found a way to do these things and maintain the semblance of our daytoday. This is the film I so wanted to see. A function society of vampires living in a world built for humanity. Sadly we don't get enough of it.What's left of humanity survives by day and dodges at night. Hematologist Edward Dalton Ethan Hawkewow its' been a while is sympathetic to their cause because he does in fact still possess his humanity. His boss Sam Neil simply wants capital which should have far less importance in a world where blood is the only real necessity. Dalton's goal is to find either a cure for the disease never explained or a substitute to replace human blood which is dwindling fast. If the powers that be can't find a solution we will all change into a creature resembles a mutant bat and Mickey Rourke's face from The Wrestler. Dalton stumbles upon a group of humans who have found a way to cure the disease. This method is explained so simplistically it's stupid to think another vampire or two wouldn't have stumbled upon it by accident too. Among this group is Audrey Claudia Kraven and Elvis Willem Dafoehere setting a precedent for clich' sadly. Elvis has been cured thanks to his love of fast cars. Don't ask. I'll only groan.Daybreakers is far from a bad film but it's certainly a stubborn and frustrating one. There is such a fantastic idea here that is tossed aside because we are supposed to identify more with the humans than we are expected to be fascinated by this vampireurbanity. The action scenes are rather clunky as well and not at all thrilling. That's quite peculiar because some shots in the film look so stellar you'd think they are from a different budget. Characterization is also at a bare minimum. Dalton for example has a soldier brother who serves simply as someone who can move the plot along he doesn't have to provide any real emotion. Neil also has a daughter Isabel Lucas last seen as chickbot in Transformers II whose screen time and presence in the film is really an utter waste. I suppose it provides Neil some motivation later on in the film but again this only serves the plot. It doesn't make the film any better which can be said about most of the scenes here.A lot of folksscratch that a lot of DUDES will like Daybreakers simply because it is not New Moon. The vampires actually bite things are dangerous act like they are vampires and not CW stars and the blood flows freely the last 10 minutes may be the goriest since Planet Terror. I didn't make this comparison as the two films only have the term vampire in common. Instead I saw a film that used a genius premise to setup a rather boring dull and far too conventional 2 hours. I wish there was more to elaborate on but truthfully any mediocre film will make you say this I don't care to.".

The only thing that is even remotely good about Daybreakers is the idea of a vampire culture. The writing acting and plot are very poor as are the crazy action scenes that seem very out of place in what should have been a dramahorror movie. Despite all this the nexus of Daybreakers' badness would have to be Willem Dafoe's over the top poorly acted character who goes by the name of Elvis that's right Elvis.Elvis is a former vampire who became human in an extremely bizarre and ridiculous accident. He accidentally crashed his sports car into a pole flew out the windshield into the sunlight and then promptly fell into the water and upon getting out he was human again. This was not just a complete fluke however this is repeated in the movie to make Dalton a human again. So according to Daybreaker rules if a vampire is set on fire by the sun and then extinguished after a certain amount of time they will become human. How? You got me.So even if you can wrap your mind around that and give Daybreakers a pass on this extremely absurd concept there isn't much to fall back on. All the characters are bad and all the drama contrived. Don't see Daybreakers unless you just want to laugh at the absurdity of it all but it can be boring at parts so even that may be ill advised.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK I went to the cinema with high expectations for this film with words like 'think matrix and 28 days later' emblazoned on posters who didn't.So Where do i begin??? Well ill start with something positive. then ill give you all the bits that i don't like and then ill end on a positive.The concept of the film is really original and is something i haven't seen in a film before. i like the fact that vampires have taken over cos lets face it if there were such things in our world then they would probably rule over us.Now for some negative remarks. After the initial pacing of the first 45 minutes everything falls apart and feels way too rushed. The cure is found out pretty much halfway through the film and is lets put it this way week to say the least.Spoiler Sunlight! a cure for vampirism is sunlight! This seems ridiculous to me. especially after the opening scene where there is a female sitting on a bench in front of her house waiting for the sunrise and as soon as it comes up she is on fire and is burnt to ash within seconds. so sunlight is a stupid cure if you are going to open your film with this scene.The introduction of one character the daughter is actually detrimental to the film. adding a story inside a story that wasn't at all needed. and added no depth just distracted from the main story and took time that could have been better used to add mood and pace.Vampire lore is not followed at all really. The vampires aren't particularly strong like they should be or fast. they are just humans really but with the added fact they needed blood. And when did vampires start eating humans. i thought that they only sucked blood. But in this film they rip humans or other vampires to shreds and eat organs and intestines this was probably just done to get the gore rating up. but really just makes you wonder what the writers were thinking.Then at the end your left wondering whether the cure is actually good for the world or bad because your left with cured humans passing on the cure but first to be able to be cured you need to devour a cured human. so surely this is a vicious cycle that will end in the devastation of the world. Makes you wonder whether the build up was worth it.The directors also go for some cheap scares little silent jumpy parts that get the girls in the cinema yelping which i suppose is OK sometimes but not every time.lets just say spierig brothers... watchowski brothers you are not! I said id end on a positive and i will. so.. The cast and acting is amazing. to see Sam Neill as a very convincing top dog is wonderful and sinister and giving Ethan hawke a go is inspired in this film as he suits the vampire look. Willem Defoe again is just amazing and has some cool one liners which adds a touch if not enough humour to the film.All in all i wish i could say that i enjoyed this film but i really really didn't. Better than the teeny vampire movies of the last 2 years but still way off for me to find entertaining.".

The Spierig brother's Daybreakers is one such movie a bloody good time where people get ripped apart heads explode and get chopped off and we get a fairly decent action thriller that presents some cool vampirific ideas and some suspense to boot. It's the future. Vampires have taken over. Only the blood supply is dwindling. Ethan Hawke plays Ed a kindly vampirehematologist who likes the humans and is for many reasons developing a blood substitute so that Vamps will stop human hunting. Others at the blood distribution center he works at are less sympathetic including boss Charles Bromley Sam Neil.Willem Dafoe gives the movie's best performance as Elvis a former vampire who managed to somehow be born again human. Ed eventually winds up working with humans to figure out how Elvis managed to do such a thing. The Spierig brothers film most scenes in either a darkly chilly blue or in a variation of lighting in one scene Ed is protected from sunlight because it's coming thru tree branches both of which look great on film. And the creature effects are scare as well as thrill. Hawke gives a nicely understated performance and Neil again proves he's underrated as an actor. Newcomer Isabel Lucas who plays Bromley's human daughter does nice work as well. The flick has a few flaws. The screenplay has a real hollow middle Neil could have used a little more oomph as the villain during this time and it feels more like a ragtag bunch of subplots and different ideas. But the ideas are amusing enough and it doesn't go too long without being entertaining enough to recommend.".

Yes....if they're just slightly covered from the sun that's fine. Only direct sun causes massive burningdeath.They heal very very fast....usually. One of the major continuity issues is when Ethan Hawke's character in attempting to cure himself is set on fire again and again and each time has no burnsscarsanything on his body right afterwards. Yet not a minute later they show another vampire with his arm in a sling....from what is alluded to being a brokendislocated shoulder. So....they heal fast....but only when it's necessary for the plot to make sense.And on that note....the plot. Blood is in short supply. Humans supposedly are getting more and more rare and going extinct....and vampires keep gobbling up blood like it was some miracle elixir. Which granted is what vampires usually do....however yet again some of them seem to be able to resistcontrol these urges while others can't. It flip flops.Essentially this is a political thriller with a supernatural twist. Everything revolves around curingfixing their resource problem. Truthfully....it's quite dumb. It's known that animal blood is drunk and sustains the vampires....yet apparently that's not a solution. A substitute is apparently a solution though....but only because it would make the vamps pay more for real blood. Like I said....they're vampires but they're still human. They are still greedy conniving scheming power hungry people. Which kind of begs the question that should have been brought up in the first place.....why turn? Because apparently many of them were given the choice to turn or to reject it. Hence why there's still humans.There are many questions you'll ask yourself while watching this and at the end you'll sit there thinking What was the point of all this to end it like that? And that is the movie's biggest disappointment. It had no point. It has no resolution to anything. It's essentially an over glossed story simply to point out the new ingenious way to cure vampires which really is quite interesting but shouldn't be the only good thing in the movie In the end....it feels more like a TV show pilot that they decided to give a huge budget and make into a film.

The premise goes as follows It is 2019 and most everyone has become a vampire. Their power and numbers become so vast that humans quickly go to the minority hunted as cattle to use for sustenance and harvested for blood. Mankind has become extinct and although the government and scientists are working around the clock for a synthetic substitute vampires are dying left and right.

I shouldn't use that comparison too much however as these vamps while intelligent creatures living and breathing with the only difference from humans being their need for blood and fear of the sun are more hybrids with the legends Hollywood has created. For example early on we see our lead Hematologist played by Ethan Hawke mysteriously absent from his car's sideview mirror a myth not true in the HBO series.Some of the population has become sympathetic to the plight of the humansthey were one once after all. Among these is Hawke's character a scientist doing his best to create a way to stay alive without the need of the dying race. His hopes are that once an alternative is found the humans will be able to repopulate and live in harmony with them hunting no longer necessary. That's all well and good but you can't tell a bloodthirsty creature to stop lusting for a kill and the government it would seem doesn't want to either. Sam Neill plays the man orchestrating it all I'm not sure if they blatantly call him it or not but for all intents and purposes he is the President. Watching his numbers slowly devolve into uncontrollable beasts monsters not even they can contain his desire for a synthetic blood is at an alltime high.

When they see he is a man of his word and a friend to the cause Edward is shown the holy grail of humanity's last hope for survival a man that has become a man once more changed back from the vampiric state that once consumed him. As subject zero Hawke must use his body and story to figure out a cure to the plague that has ravaged Earth. The solution may no longer be a need for a blood substitute but now a way to turn everyone back into humans.The story is strong and entertaining throughout despite its obvious ending and reconciliation. However it is what makes up the duration that puts the film above the normal vampire action romp. I love the technology that has been invented making life entirely vampireproof. Every building in the cities have been fitted with connecting tunnels so people may move to and fro without the threat of sun every window is equipped with a black out shutter and cars are allowed to go into lockdown with front and side monitors for daytime driving. The brainstorming session to come up with these gadgets had to have been a ton of fun. I can just imagine giant white boards outlining each shortcoming to the vampire and then the multitude of ways to solve them. It is a decade of work by an increasingly growing population so the fact that it all allows for the 247 travel of a vampire makes sense. They are the new humans so a way to work long hours and not have to hibernate half the day away is key.Some problems do exist in the need to glamorize and make everything visually interesting. One scene in particular looks beautiful but makes you question the validity of survival in that situation. It's a daytime meeting between Hawke who by the way plays the role perfectly he does it seriously a necessity for his Edward to be taken realistically as the Samaritan he is and a rebel fighter played by Willem Dafoe again perfect but so overthetop that each oneliner met with rapturous applause which could have also been because he was in the audience watching. Hawke is directed to park under a tree and get out to talk deftly avoiding the rays of light peaking through the leaves above him. I guess only direct sunlight affects them. But hey this is a horror film looking to entertain one can't take those things too seriously. It's all about the exploding bodie decapitated heads and slomotion mass of humanity with biting blood and violence at the enda truly stunning scene. The Spierigs play it right at every turn making a helluva good time in a compact 98 minutes that could surprise the box office come January.".

The sexual connotations in Stoker's original Dracula are more blatant now than they ever have been. Vampires are sleek and sexy and the lust for blood is often ignored. 'Daybreakers' is an original look at a tired genre. It adds a soft beat to the heart of the vampire film which has thus far avoided its much deserved staking.'Daybreakers' is the vampire film for the logical thinker. It isn't overly intelligent but it does something few films of this genre do. The world in 'Daybreakers' is by far one of the most imaginative horror environments in recent memory. The entire world has turned into vampires and humans are harvested for their precious blood. The problem is the vampires are glutenous and the world is running dry. When I read the synopsis a smile came to my face. For one thing it is a vampire film that actually acknowledges the fact that vampires need blood for sustenance. This is by no means a trivial detail in the vampire mythology. How often have we seen the Anne Rice inspired vampires of today hunger for blood? It's satisfying to see vampires with animal urges. We aren't supposed to want to be vampires. The ideal vampire is the tortured Graf Orlock from F.W Murnau's Nosferatu and taken even farther in Werner Herzog's excellent Nosferatu remake. Vampirism is a curse. The plot of 'Daybreakers' is actually quite brilliant. People view vampirism as the next step in Darwinian evolution and embrace it. Death is no longer a factor and so these vampires indulge  I love the fact that every vampire in the film is a chain smoker Slowly but surely the animistic hunger gets the better of them and the vampires devolve into creatures reminiscent of Max Schrek.The plot is excellent the characters not so much. The Spierg brothers have created an intricate universe for very dull characters to inhabit. Edward Dalton is a bore. He turns out to be a Boy Scout who never wanted to be a vampire and who works tirelessly to end the need for human blood. I don't want a goody good. It would be much more interesting if Dalton thought like the Sam Neill character Charles Bromley. Bromley has a twisted love for vampirism for all the right reasons. He was diagnosed with terminal cancer and chose life through bizarre unholy means. Wouldn't the character of Dalton be much more interesting if he too had some stake in vampirism? As it stands the characters are just plot pieces. None are really fleshed out except for Neill's villain. They are played well enough Willem Dafoe has a lot of fun with his role. I just don't care about what they are saying. I really wish richer characters were put in this inspired world. As it stands there are moments where the film is no better than a conventional splatter film. I still think it is much better than that but the Spierig brothers could have done much more in helping this world work.".

The idea that vampires are not the angst ridden teens of the TWILIGHT saga makes a nice change and it's fascinating that they're victims of Malthus doctrine of population that is causing them to become mutant degenerates called  subsiders  . DAYBREAKERS is absolutely compelling and thought provoking when it concentrates on the dilemmas facing the vampire race There is a massive spanner in the works and that is within the internal logic of the film it is far too convenient that it's only now with a one months supply of blood remaining the vampires only realise the problem facing them . It's also a bit too convenient that one of the vampires just happens to bump in to a character who was once a vampire who has found a way to reverting back to human form . The solution to this reversion back in to human is so simplistic it's impossible to believe that in the preceding ten years a population of several billion vampires haven't stumbled upon this easy cure This ties in with another flaw of the movie and that is the villains aren't really the vampires but corporate capitalism . In some ways it's a bit of a conspiracy thriller where the cure will affect a company's profits and therefore they think it's a better idea to keep everyone has a vampire rather than a human . It might be an interesting theory but the chief baddie played by Sam Neil is painted so broadly he stops being a cinematic character and becomes a clich This is a great pity because DAYBREAKERS is a genuinely impressive stylish horror movie in parts that brings a new twist to the genre . I did actually suffer a couple of startle moments that caused me to jump and it's also a film that has a sharp and cold cinematography that suits the film perfectly but as is often said if a film is good it's down to the director and if it's bad it's down to the screenplay and the screenplay just falls short of making this a classic horror movie".

	schema:reviewBody "You'd think that after 80 years of vampire movies there's little 'fresh blood' to be added to the genre but Daybreakers proved such pessimist thinking wrong. Containing one of the most intriguing premises I've ever come across this film puts a wholly different spin on the notion of the undead thriving on the blood of their human victims. In the not too distant future a viral outbreak has turned most of the world population into vampires while regular human beings have become quite the endangered species. Since the vamps need human blood to survive while they are as immortal as usual blood shortages are increasingly threatening the societal status quo which remains remarkably human in appearance. A hematologist Ethan Hawke works tirelessly on a synthetic blood substitute experiments which continue to fail partially because the CEO of the company that controls the 'real deal' a deliciously sinister Sam Neill is rather keen to keep making the big bucks off rich vampires that can afford genuine blood. Vampires or not money is still the driving factor behind it all to the detriment of civilization. The situation is getting ever more untenable as poorer vampires are so desperate they start feeding on each other or even on themselves causing them to mutate into crazed bat people a funny take on the ever present relationship between vampires and bats which otherwise plays no significant part in this film freaks that are brutally exterminated by the authorities. Hawke's sympathetic scientist made vampire by his brother against his will proves a guilt ridden person determined to change this upside down world for the better and sympathizes with what few humans remain free continuously hunted by the vampire military as they are. After aiding a group of humans evade capture he is contacted by an underground resistance movement led by exvampire Willem Dafoe that aims to develop a cure for vampirism the only viable way for both humans and vampires to survive their impending doom. Hawke accepts their invitation and joins their cause which soon pits him and the rebels against Neill's profit driven tyranny.Daybreakers' strongest moments are found in its first half as we explore a world where vampirism is the normal state of being and society has evolved to accommodate it. Since the vampires of Daybreakers adhere to many of the archetypal characteristics of the genre they also cannot abide ultraviolet light and therefore life takes place at night so commonplace items like houses and cars are designed to protect against sunlight. In other regards this world differs little from our own as the vamps work in order to pay their bills buy their blood and live their immortal life. The disturbing imagery of humans forcefully strapped to transfusion tubes and slowly drained of their life essence in huge factory like environments successfully evokes comparisons to how we ourselves as a species treat animals in the bioindustry for our own basic needs without allowing them any shred of dignity and natural behavior. The vampire world is living in its 11th hour close to selfannihilation caused by plain and simple greed of those in power who prove unwilling to change for the common good in some regards echoing our own inability to alter our ways for the better in fear of loosing what we gained. In the second half of the movie Daybreakers sheds such symbolism and largely replaces the exposition of its fascinating dystopia in favor of more trite and true action scenes and an overabundance of traditional gore including some almost orgiastic blood baths of famished vampires feeding. Whether society is ultimately changed for the better is left somewhat ambiguous as the movie underscores the notion that vampires for all their superior physical strength are still always all too human in their limited line of thinking. Though it's a pity the movie doesn't end as strongly as it started it doesn't undermine Daybreakers' position as one of the more ingenious vampire films to date a far cry from the currently popular image of these undead as sexy hunks to appeal to teenage audiences.".

	schema:reviewBody "Someone once said Everything old is new again. I'm sure when those words were first uttered the furthest thing from the person's mind was a futuristic vampire film starring Ethan Hawke. That saying certainly applies to the new film from The Spierig Brothers UNDEAD. Over the past few years the vampire story has lost it's balls. It's become a characterture of itself. Instead of undead dying when they set foot in the sun they sparkle like backup dancers for Adam Lambert. Love stories have taken over from scary stories. DAYBREAKERS is a return to form. In 2019 the future is overrun by vampires. Humans are the minority and are hunted and farmed for their blood. Sam Neill JURASSIC PARK THE OMEN III plays Charles Bromley the C.E.O. of a different type of blood bank. When we come in to the movie it is found out that there is only a month's worth of blood left for the entire vampire population. We find out that Bromley is having his scientists look for an alternate blood source. We are introduced to Edward Dalton played by Ethan Hawke GATICA DEAD POET'S SOCIETY. He is one of the top scientist looking for the new blood. Dalton even with being a vampire doesn't like being part of the walking dead. Instead of looking for an alternate blood supply he'd rather find a cure. Claudia Karvan plays Audrey Bennett the leader in the human movement to survive and destroy the vampires. Willem Defoe SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE THE LAST TEMPTAION OF Christ plays Bennett's right hand man. To say too much about the plot would give away too much of the story. The movie is a good throwback to vampire films that have been forgotten about. There is a cool shot of a forgotten part of the vampire mythos. When we first meet Edward Dalton he drives up to his work but we first see him or don't in fact through his driver side mirror. All we see are his clothes and we pan up to see him getting out of his car. If you remember a vampire has no reflection and it's little nuances like this that make this such a fun movie. Even with the movie taking place in the future the look is very much in the vein of the old 1950's film noir. The marketing seemed to make this out to be like UNDERWORLD a horror film with much action but it was more of a horrorscifi film mixed with a drama. The story can be a little slow moving but I feel you are better able to follow the story that way as opposed to a film that would just be a lot of shooting and fighting. There is certainly an undertone of relying too much on natural resources that are running out and looking for something to replace them with. It is very similar to the problems we are facing now with oil and there is no coincidence to that. There is also another undertone and that is of trying to rid the world of the unfortunates. The reason another blood supply is being looked for is when a vampire hasn't had blood for a period of time hinted at about a month they turn from their more human looks to looking more like vampire bats. At one point it gets out of control and people want to do away with them. It is similar to how people treat the homeless or another parallel is to how the Jews and Gypsies were treated during the Holocaust. One of the things I want to commend the Spierig Brothers for is their choice of cure. There has never been anything in the vampire mythos that says anything about a cure and I know that this has been part of the debate of this movie. Most people think it's sill but I happen to like their cure. It gives an interesting twist to the story. The Spierig Brothers have certainly brought the balls back to a dying subgenre and I look forward to what they have to work on in the future. The story ends in a way that this can be the only one or it there can be more. If the cast and directors were to come back I would be down for future installments.".

The boss in the power plant and just about everyone here is terrible!Worst line delivery Ok doctor we'll just evacuate the entire country before you can say Jack Robinson. Actually anything said by the sheriff makes you want to kill him. He's amazing in the sense that every single line he says sounds exactly the same!There are no little creatures here no trolls no goblins no nothing. Whoever renamed this movie to The Crawlers and removed the Troll 3 name shows me there is hope for the world after all. Because this movie HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TROLLS!They must've saved a lot of money by using killer roots instead of creatures.Who finances this kind of cp and why? I can only think that the targeted audience is that of nonenglish speaking countries where the people are used to dubbing.I bought this for 3.75 expecting at least the fun I had with Troll 2 because in spite of that movie's long list of shortcomings it had some very funny elements. None of those elements are present in Troll 3. There is however a hysterical scene where the killer roots kill a man in a suit who's chasing the hero with a gun. The guy takes forever and a day to die and he screams pathetically through it all.Troll 2 had a little boy and a monster on the video cover neither of which were in the movie. Troll 3 has a sexy girl on the Crawlers cover who you've guessed it is nowhere to be seen in the movie.Troll 3 just plain sucks.".

One gets stranded at a small gas station while the other is returning to her small town home after having left it and her fianc when she was in high school. For some time we keep cutting between the two of them which is awkward.Most of the acting was pretty poor unfortunately. The Sheriff and his deputy the nuclear plant's executives goons and whistleblower were are particularly bad. The threat in the movie is roots which have been contaminated by radioactive waste. They're now extremely long and carnivorous. What isn't clear is if they are just roots crawling around like worms unconnected to anything or if they are the roots of some tree or trees that are likewise mutated. We never see.At one point the townspeople show up to fight the roots. How that came to happen is not explained. Inexplicably their solution is to find the barrels of nuclear waste that had been dumped in the forest and dig them up and put them in their trucks. They start to do this without any protective suits! Another solution is to bury the barrels under even more dirt which doesn't make much sense either. Why the roots would stop attacking or why they would die when the barrels are carted away or further buried is entirely unclear.The ending is particularly bad.

	schema:reviewBody "Contamination .7 or The Crawlers as I think it's more commonly known is set in the small American town of Littleton where Josie Mary Sellers has just returned after several years away to reunite with her family there  her ex boyfriend Matt Jason Saucier as well. However Josie has picked a bad time to return home as the corrupt head of a nearby nuclear power plant has been stealing the money used to safely dispose of radioactive waste  dumping it in the local woods which has the unwanted side effect of producing mutated killer roots which have a taste for human flesh! Can the residents of Littleton save themselves from becoming tree food?This Canadian production has Martin Newlin credited as director but that's just a pseudonym for Fabrizio Laurenti  the IMDb also claims Joe D'Amato had something to do with it but the version I saw only had one credited director anyway this has a pretty bad reputation  I can't really say it's undeserved. The script by Laurenti Albert Lawrence  Daniele Stroppa is an ecohorror with a message basically pollution is bad. Now this sentiment is all very well  good but it would have helped if there was a decent film behind it  then there's the fact that Contamination .7 is far from the first film to tackle this issue. The character's  dialogue are poor their decision making is hopeless  at times strange some of the scenes here are just plain ridiculous  make no sense it's too long at 100 odd minutes it has next to no gore or exploitation  it's just very badly written  thought out right down to a none event of an ending. Having said that I actually found it watchable in a really bad kind of way I don't know why but I was actually glued to it! Maybe just to see how bad it got I don't know but I've certainly seen worse  there was just something here that I liked I mean I didn't like it much but as far as I'm concerned I saw something in it.Director Laurenti doesn't impress here with plenty of continuity mistakes  probably the single most pathetic model bulldozer special effect ever the model they use is obviously a kids toy  it looks terrible. Then there's the killer roots themselves who never really do much apart from wrap themselves around people  we never see what they are attached to either. There's no gore here except one scene when the corrupt Sheriff has a root enter his mouth  exit through his eye socket...Technically this is alright forget about the continuity mistakes it's quite well made  beats hands down many low budget horror films that are made these days. The acting is poor by an obviously amateur cast some of whom appear to have been very badly dubbed in particular the Sheriff.Contamination .7 is a terrible film for sure  I'm not saying otherwise but for some strange reason I sort of liked it for what it is don't get me wrong as 99.9 of the film going public will hate it with a passion but I guess I'm in that 00.1 minority  proud of it although I'm not quite sure what that says about me.".

The character's  dialogue are poor their decision making is hopeless  at times strange some of the scenes here are just plain ridiculous  make no sense it's too long at 100 odd minutes it has next to no gore or exploitation  it's just very badly written  thought out right down to a none event of an ending. Having said that I actually found it watchable in a really bad kind of way I don't know why but I was actually glued to it! Maybe just to see how bad it got I don't know but I've certainly seen worse  there was just something here that I liked I mean I didn't like it much but as far as I'm concerned I saw something in it.Director Laurenti doesn't impress here with plenty of continuity mistakes  probably the single most pathetic model bulldozer special effect ever the model they use is obviously a kids toy  it looks terrible. Then there's the killer roots themselves who never really do much apart from wrap themselves around people  we never see what they are attached to either. There's no gore here except one scene when the corrupt Sheriff has a root enter his mouth  exit through his eye socket...Technically this is alright forget about the continuity mistakes it's quite well made  beats hands down many low budget horror films that are made these days. The acting is poor by an obviously amateur cast some of whom appear to have been very badly dubbed in particular the Sheriff.Contamination .7 is a terrible film for sure  I'm not saying otherwise but for some strange reason I sort of liked it for what it is don't get me wrong as 99.9 of the film going public will hate it with a passion but I guess I'm in that 00.1 minority  proud of it although I'm not quite sure what that says about me.";

It seems that the trees in the nearby forest are contaminated with radioactivity because of course there's a nuclear power plant in the vicinity and now they've become predatory with roots that lash out and snare a number of hapless victims. Josie is among the insipid heroes also including her wouldbe boyfriend Matt Jason Saucier investigative reporter Brian Patrick Collins who's the grandson of one of the locals and drunken scientist Taylor Bubba Reeves who realizes early on that there's a danger.Overall an uninteresting and barely entertaining feature that features what has to be one of the worst acting performances that this viewer has ever seen by Vince O'Neil as the sheriff. He makes some of his costars seem like Olivier by comparison. All of this leads to a very very absurd finale where the townsfolk band together to do something although one has to wonder what they hope to accomplish. It makes no sense whatsoever. You add to this the extremely overused It ain't over yet! final moment and the end result is an inane mess that should fade into obscurity.Four out of 10.".

Victims include an obnoxious sheriff a female hitchhiker passing through town a farmer and his wife a hooker with a heart of gold and a gas station attendant and his pet dog Chester. The roots mostly just trip or strangle people and make a hilarious whipcracking noise whenever they attack. They also make a toy helicopter explode by pulling it about two feet to the ground.

So be forewarned no trolls make an appearance in CONTAMINATION.7 aka TROLL 3. Hell there aren't even any goblins.And unfortunately while TROLL 2 failed in an enjoyable awful way this one fails to reach that film's same level of redeeming unintentional hilarity. Though thoroughly inept it's also boring clichd slowmoving and far too tame to really be enjoyable. The fact they used inexperienced local talent to fill out the cast along with providing these laughably bad amateur thesps with truly rotten dialogue throughout the film is the only point of possible enjoyment though even that got old quickly.Probably best known as THE CRAWLERS here in the States though the version I viewed was titled CREEPERS. Don't know if that's a cut version of this film or not but I highly doubt it. I'm also not sure of Joe D'Amato's actual involvement since his name or David Hills for that matter is nowhere to be found in the credits.

Unlike many of these Italian productions they didn't spend or didn't have money to drag any American name actors into the movie leaving us with what seems like a totally amateur cast.This can be seen now under its original title and in HD on cable and that may be a hate crime against those who watch it but at least it's not pretended to be something it's not.The monster in the movie is a bunch of not very convincing tree roots that actor struggle to pretend to fight withusually to pretty unconvincing results. It tries a sort of Psycho plot set up which has a lousy and bloodless pay off. The gal in this segment is sort of appealing and very attractive in somewhat skimpy clothingbut don't expect any nudity from her. Most of the deaths are bloodlesscheaply done. Also the movie has no nudity and no style and not much sense.There is some decent helicopter footage of actual wilderness and towards the end some nice bulldozers at night attacking the monster rootsthough this sequence also features a funny Tonka Toy miniature that ruins that scene. Also the movie features a toy helicopter explosion.A poorly made film that is barely pro level production the acting and casting is really bad and so there is nothing to keep you going between badly done very stiff tentacle tree root attack scenes that come pretty few and far between.I kind of enjoyed the freeze frame ending. Easily one of the most poorly made films of its era. Has some highlow lights but is for the most part a slow ride of filler material of family drama etc.Music score is cheesy and dated and would have sounded just as cheesy and dated when the movie was new. There is one memorable scene between angry town people and evil corporate exec that almost makes this a must see for bad movie fans.

Lots of likable characters in a small town almost places this movie along the lines of a movie like Critters 1986 though by far not of the same quality level naturally. It's just a bit of shameless Bhorror movie fun but it's too bad that there's only one memorable killing in it really the root of a tree going in one's mouth and coming out of his eye socket good stuff!. If it would have had a couple more I wouldn't even have flunked it. Inexplicably this film was also released onto the video market under the Troll 3 title. The only explanation I can find for this is that Creepers was also made by Italians. They did the same with the humongously bad Troll 2 1990 which had nothing to do with John Carl Buechler's original Troll 1986. Safe to say that Creepers aka Contamination.7 is a better film than Troll 2. But that's not saying much of course.".

I believe the cast had more potential to make us laugh but apparently the director tried too hard to be serious.  I try not to get caught up in things like logic in these kinds of movies but I mean come on !!! the helicopter exploded two feet from the ground.  Anyway when I found out there was a sequel to Troll 2 I thought it would be superb but obviously I was wrong.  At least I only paid 1.75 for the VHS copy and as a friend of mine pointed out it's really sad when the shipping of a movie out weighs the actual cost.

	schema:reviewBody "I had heard this film was awful but I did not take heed of this warning. Instead I thought it might be a 'it's so bad it's good' movie. I had also heard that this film was also packaged as Troll 3 which had me perplexed as I knew the film was about killer trees so how could they tie this film to that one...well I found out! The acting is on par with that scene in Troll 2 where the guy goes There eating her and then they are going to eat me...oh my god! Except the horrific acting is all through this film there are no good effects aside from one okay kill and most insane is that there is no nudity! I mean these girls are nobodies how can a movie maker not get a bunch of nobody actresses to get naked? Not that I wanted to see the mousy lead girl but the girl they tease as the star was attractive and the hooker had nice cleavage. This film was made by MGM the same company that brought us the superbly entertaining Return of the Living Dead which featured actors of note and they got Linnea Quigley to not only go topless but full nude and she is an incredible actress compared to the idiots in this film! So you get nothing! Most of the kills are off screen the sex is off screen and what we get on screen are a bunch of people you will want dead by the film's end. I will be honest I was pulling for the roots to kill the entire town and especially that annoying kid! All they did was tease though...The story has a couple of girls coming to a small town. At first they make it out that this one girl who was rather attractive was going to be the lead one but that was just a tease. No our main girl is this mousy looking girl coming home is the lead one. It's a shame because not only was the other girl more attractive but she was probably the best actress in the film...of course that is not saying much at all. Well seems a guy at the local power plant has been detecting radiation outside the plant and there is something shady going on. People start turning up dead as there is one off screen kill after another. Finally we learn that the plant is illegally dumping waste into the woods which causes the roots not the trees mind you to come alive and kill people and if you think there is a scene that is as hot as the DVD cover of this film then you are going to be sorely disappointed.This film was just bad on so many levels. I do not see how MST3K missed this one except perhaps it is because it was made by a major distributor in MGM and was fairly new 1993. Granted I thought the film was from the 80's as I cannot believe this one was made the same year as Jurassic Park heck I cannot believe it was made the same year as Super Mario Brothers! The effects of the roots were ripped straight from Evil Dead and at times it looked somewhat okay but even when it looks good it gets totally undone by the bad acting going on. I also love the scene where they describe the girl from the beginning who got killed and people say she was blond when she was clearly a brunette.So bad bad and bad. I did not enjoy it as it gave me nothing. Had they given me some more gore and nudity it would have been more watchable with a shortening of the run time as well. As is it seemed to take forever to get to the kills and then you think it is going to wrap up and the whole town comes in and they start preparing for their counter attack on the roots. How MGM who made good horror films came out with this crap I will never know. I have seen adult movies with better acting and effects than this I have seen straight to DVD horror films shot with a video camera that are better than this! Heck this is a film that Manos is better than! Not a good film fails miserably on almost every front.".

	schema:reviewBody "Contamination .7 1990  12 out of 4 D'Amato was a director with many different genres attached to his name and here he once again steps into the horror field but the end results are less than stellar. In the film a woman Mary Sellers returns home to her small town and sees that nothing much has changed. The only thing going on is a nuclear plant in town that is dumping toxic waste in the woods which is making the tree roots come to life and start attacking people. If you remember in THE EVIL DEAD there was a pretty graphic and tense scene where a tree comes to life. If you're expecting that same quality here then you're going to be disappointed because this is a pretty poor film from start to finish with very little to recommend. Also released as THE CRAWLERS its U.S. title and TROLL III this movie really seems lost as to what it's trying to do as it's clearly meant for horror fans but it delivers no scares no violence no gore and not even any nudity at least for the first hour. The movie features your typical bad performances but thankfully most are so bad that you're bound to get several laughs out of them including an old man who is constantly throwing out one or two words at bad times just to say he agrees or disagrees with someone. The film contains just about every bad thing you'd expect from a movie like this and that includes but is not limited to the score the cinematography the editing and the special effects. The one bit of blood is a scene where a man gets a root through the mouth and then eye. The effect is incredibly bad but at least there was some blood. The final thirtyminutes of this movie is where things finally pick up as the redneck town decides to fight back and try to destroy the roots. There are so many logical issues with what happens but at least the entertainment value picks up as there's just one dumb scene after another. I love the fact that they're dealing with toxic waste yet everyone is just rolling around in it and even letting their children mess around with it. We get some incredibly silly stock footage as well as a helicopter crash using the worst toy I've seen in any movie. The final tenminutes also feature a lot more root attacks than the previous eighty so that is a good thing. Fans of the genre would be best advised to skip this turkey but fans of bad cinema might want to check it out just for the end. I'm really not sure how much D'Amato director or if Laurenti took most of the shots but TROLL 2 looks rather smart compared to this thing. D'Amato's ex leading lady Laura Gemser did the Costume Design here which is basically just jeans and tshirts.".

	schema:headline " A fine Howdunit!";
	schema:reviewBody "I may have seen this film ages ago but seeing clips in Johnny Gaddaar reminded me that I needed to revisit the film. The film was an early career venture for Navin Nischol and Amitabh. Navin was cute romanced the girl Yogita Bali  was she a bit squint eyed? got all the song numbers and Big B played the sensitive introverted artist who secretly loves the girl but cannot have her. But seeing her with Navin twists the knife of jealousy deeper and deeper in until he decides that all is fair in love and war and declares a most insidious war. Yogita was OK Om Prakash was a complete natural as ever and Shotgun Sinha overacted like hell in a cameo court scene. There was an obligatory item number from Helen. Oh  Kaifi Azmi wrote the lyrics and they were mostly mundane. Two songs were decent  Yun Na Sharma Phaila De Apni Gori Gori Baahen and Simti Si Sharmai Si Kis Duniya Se tum Aayi ho.The film had a very Bgrade feel to it but the plot was extremely innovative  no wonder Sriram Raghavan got inspired! Navin Nischol was like a lost kid and it was hard to get too involved in the lovers played by him and Yogita. Amitabh was intense all the way through and had flashes of brilliance in the film. But it was the 70s and his negative role had to have redemption at the end. There might have been some problem with the way the character of Kumar developed because while the film was most interesting and engaging throughout I felt a clinical detachment from the players as I watched it. I think this was not very much like Jewel Thief and Johnny Mera Naam instead of a whodunit suspenseful tale this was a Howdunit and very unique for its time. Worth a watch for the plot and for seeing the beginnings of Big B.".

	schema:headline " The inspiration behind Johnny Gaddaar";
	schema:reviewBody "I liked Sriram Raaghavan directed thriller movie  Johnny Gaddaar 2007 very much. In that movie the hero in fact the villain Neil Mukesh murders a member of their criminal group by seeking inspiration from a very old Amitabh Bachchan starrer  Parwaana 1971. Today's generation who has liked Johnny Gaddaar is not aware of this long forgotten movie. Here comes the review of this movie which is a combo of lovetriangle thrilling murder plan and courtroom drama.Parwaana is an Urdu word which means wax moth who hovers about the lit candle known as Shama in Urdu. In classic Urdu poetry Shaayari it is deemed that Parwaana loves Shama and that's why it hovers about it only to lose its life by getting burnt in its blaze. Due to this assumption a sincere sacrificing male lover is called Parwaana who is ever ready to give away even his life for the sake of his love for his sweetheart who is Shama for him.The Parwaana of this story is an introvert artist  Kumar Sen Amitabh Bachchan who has been loving his Shama  Asha Yogeeta Baali within his heart for years but without expressing his love to her. Asha is an orphan fostered by her widower uncle Ashok Varma Om Prakash who likes Kumar very much and has no objection to Asha's marriage to him. However Kumar gets a big jolt when he comes to know from Asha that she has fallen in love with Rajesh Naveen Nishchal. When Kumar conveys his sentiments to her she says that it's too late now and her heart has become Rajesh's. Knowing Asha's uncle's positive opinion about him he tries to pursue him to decide in his favour but the uncle refuses to go against the the wishes and joys of his orphan niece. Now Kumar concludes that he has to follow the ages old dictum  'Everything is fair in love and war'.One night when Kumar is known to have departed for Kolkata then Calcutta by catching a train from Mumbai Central then Bombay Central and Asha has gone to attend the marriage of her friend Rajesh gets a call from Kumar who asks him to go to Asha's house to attend an emergency with her uncle. When Rajesh reaches there he finds that somebody has strangled Asha's uncle  Ashok Varma to death. He is the prime suspect for this murder and when a letter from Ashok Varma reaches him a couple of days later rejecting any prospects of the marriage of Asha with him the cops are sure of his guilt. He is arrested and put under trial for the murder. The truth behind Ashok Varma's murder is revealed in the end.No prizes for guessing as to who committed the murder of Asha's uncle  Ashok Varma and framed Rajesh under its charge. This is not a whodunnit but actually a howdunnit. The viewer knows the murderer very well but the thing that he does not know is how he could do it. The writer of the story whose crux is the murder plan only is Madhusudan whereas the screenplay and dialogs have been written by Agha Jaani Kashmeeri. This story idea is just very good but the screenplay and the direction by Jyoti Swaroop could not do proper justice to it. The cover of its VCD  DVD says about it  'A murder plan that forced Indian railways to change their train timing'. Well it appears to be more a promotional strategy for the VCD  DVD. However there is little doubt that this murder plan is just superb considering the facts prevailing in that period when identity proofs were not demanded from the travellers and when the airtickets used to be issued in traditional under glossy jacket form from the counters and etickets had not even been conceptualized. All the performers have done well except Shatrughan Sinha in his cameo as the public prosecutor because he is over the top. Romantic hero late Naveen Nishchal has got good songs and he alongwith Yogeeta Baali make a good onscreen pair. Seasoned actor Om Prakash has performed quite admirably. Supporting cast has also not disappointed. But finally it's the movie of Amitabh Bachchan who is the Parwaana ready to do anything for his Shama i.e. Yogeeta Baali. This is a rare movie in which the role of the antagonist is much stronger than that of the protagonist. Despite his controlled performance the glimpses of the wouldbe angry young man can be seen in the eyes of AB. He has delivered praiseworthy performance in the authorbacked role and Om Prakash had rightly asserted for him after the shooting of the scene of his murder that a star was in the making. I term AB's performance in this movie as one of his underrated performances. This was the first role of his career containing gray shades.I am a great admirer of the music of late Madan Mohan but in this movie his compositions contain only a couple of good ones. The best one is  Simti Si Sharmaai Si Kis Duniya Se Tum Aai Ho Kishore Kumar. The second good song is  Yun Na Sharma Phaila De Apni Gori Gori Baahen sung jointly by Kishore Kumar and Mohammed Rafi. The lyrics of Kaifi Aazmi are good.Since all the spectators of today's generation who are fond of watching mysteries  thrillers have wholeheartedly admired Johnny Gaddaar I think they should watch Parwaana too which had inspired the story of Johnny Gaddaar. It's one of the long forgotten and underrated movie of Amitabh Bachchan and hence the fans of AB also should not miss it.".

	schema:headline " Remarkable and intelligent account about a mature couple  being well directed and wonderfully performed";
	schema:reviewBody "Patchy weeper with terrific and enjoyable performances  in which a businessman Frank Valente Anthony Quinn romancing criminal's widow named Rose Bianco Sophia Loren and the principal problem results in convincing their children that marriage will make all their lives better . As the Italian Frank wooing a mobster's widow that leads to unexpected consequences . Both of whom are strongly involved with their sons  as Frank has to convince his sternly moralising daughter Ina Balin about marry herself to Noble Peter Mark Richman  while Rose must convince her little boy Ralph Jimmy Baird who usually is locked at remand home like in N.Y. State Farm . This is a plain and simple film with plenty of interesting drama  Soap opera  emotion and a sensitive as well as unexpectedly tender romance . Filmmaker Martin Ritt has got a considerable success in delineating their troublesome roles in this fabricated Soaper . Various characterstudios furnish the basis for this agreeable drama and it results to be a superb piece of acting . Excellent interpretation by protagonist duo  as Anthony Quinn as the bungling businessman romancing a moll's beautiful widow  this was the first of Anthony's European roles leading to his hit five years later in Zorba the Greek . And Sophia Loren playing magnificently the mature but attractive crook's widow  though she was 23 years old during filming only 10 years older than the actor playing her juvenile son . The picture also established Loren's claim as a player of some worth and paved the way for her Acadeny Awardwinning success three years later in Two women and her triumph in The Cid . It is a mostly staged drama in which the two main actors spend the majority of the movie attempting to persuade their children that all will be better if they marry and it can work out . Nice screenplay by Joseph Stefano dealing with sensitive themes such as the disintegration of a family  an enticing love story  rebellious childhood and including engaging dialogs .

	onyx:emotionText "Patchy weeper with terrific and enjoyable performances  in which a businessman Frank Valente Anthony Quinn romancing criminal's widow named Rose Bianco Sophia Loren and the principal problem results in convincing their children that marriage will make all their lives better . As the Italian Frank wooing a mobster's widow that leads to unexpected consequences . Both of whom are strongly involved with their sons  as Frank has to convince his sternly moralising daughter Ina Balin about marry herself to Noble Peter Mark Richman  while Rose must convince her little boy Ralph Jimmy Baird who usually is locked at remand home like in N.Y. State Farm . This is a plain and simple film with plenty of interesting drama  Soap opera  emotion and a sensitive as well as unexpectedly tender romance . Filmmaker Martin Ritt has got a considerable success in delineating their troublesome roles in this fabricated Soaper . Various characterstudios furnish the basis for this agreeable drama and it results to be a superb piece of acting . Excellent interpretation by protagonist duo  as Anthony Quinn as the bungling businessman romancing a moll's beautiful widow  this was the first of Anthony's European roles leading to his hit five years later in Zorba the Greek . And Sophia Loren playing magnificently the mature but attractive crook's widow  though she was 23 years old during filming only 10 years older than the actor playing her juvenile son . The picture also established Loren's claim as a player of some worth and paved the way for her Acadeny Awardwinning success three years later in Two women and her triumph in The Cid . It is a mostly staged drama in which the two main actors spend the majority of the movie attempting to persuade their children that all will be better if they marry and it can work out . Nice screenplay by Joseph Stefano dealing with sensitive themes such as the disintegration of a family  an enticing love story  rebellious childhood and including engaging dialogs . Evocative cinematography in VistaVision by Robert Burks  he's a classic cameraman and Hitchcock's usual . The music is sparse but it's potent and lively every time it appears  it was composed by Alessandro Cicognini .This understatement motion picture was well produced by Carlo Ponti  Sophia Loren's husband  and professionally directed by Martin Ritt who worked with Paul Newman in three Westerns  Hombre  Hud and Outrage.

	schema:reviewBody "I never knew about this film until I saw it on Netflix and decided to rent the DVD. I have always loved Sophia Loren. Along with Audrey Hepburn she was my favorite female star growing up. Here's a 50s kitchen sink drama that if you look too hard seems awfully implausible. Loren plays the widow of a mafioso who has been killed drying to give his Italianborn wife Sophia everything her heart desires. Now a griefstricken widow she's trying to make ends meet while coping with a son who keeps running away until he is sent to a reform school. Her nosy nextdoor neighbor wants to fix Sophia up with a family friend but Sophia resists wallowing in her own selfpity and guilt convinced her desire for material needs has caused her husband's death. Enter Athony Quinn a somewhat older mana widower with a grown daughter Ina Balin on the eve of her own marriage. Quinn's wife has died apparently suffering from some form of mental breakdown and Quinn's daughter has been lovingly and obsessively taking care of her father. Quinn notices Sophia and falls for her right away. After resisting his advances she finally begins to date him and in not time at all Quinn proposes saying he will sell the New York home in Little Italy and move to Somerville NJ near his factory and help her get her son out of reform school and live happily as a family. The difficulty here is Quinn's possessive daughter who is now insisting that her fianc move into with her and daddy after they marry. He understandably balks at the suggestion and whenever they argue she has the bad habit of simply walking away from him. Of course when she finds out that her Dad wants to marry that Mafia woman Quinn's daughter has a meltdown. In a confrontation Daddy slaps daughter who retires to her bedroom refusing to come out. All is resolved when Sophia takes matters in her own hands and confronts the daughter. Sophia and Quinn are blissfully reunited and her son is released form the reform school. The daughter is reconciled with her fianc and they all live happily ever after. This is utterly absurd and doesn't make a bit of sense. However under Martin Ritt's expert direction Sophia delivers an expert subtly acted performance that she would later become truly famous for. Quinn is outstanding but you've seen this big sensitive and physically imposing performance before. The daughter's role is the big hole in this movie and newcomer Balin cannot do a thing to make her likable. The rest of the cast does their job expertly. Still the movie achieves wonderfully acted moments and anything that Sophia did during this period is worth watching. Her Hollywood years didn't yield a lot of outstanding studio movies but she always transcends the thin material she's given. Sophia's essential luminescence always shines through. More than worthwhile.".

	schema:reviewBody "Black Orchid The 1958  out of 4 Rose Sophia Loren is a young Italian woman who has just buried her husband who was murdered by the gangsters he worked for. Rose's depression soon takes another turn when her young son gets sent to a boarding school for breaking into parking meters. News gets even worse for her son after many attempts at running away one more attempt will send him into a reform school where he won't get released until he is much older. With all the heartbreak going on Rose spends her evenings alone making what money she can.Down the street is Frank Anthony Quinn another widower who is getting ready to see his only daughter married. Frank is the type who keeps a smile on his face no matter how much bad luck life delivers him. When he first sees Rose he notices her extreme beauty but soon he becomes interested in the person that he has so much in common with. Rose finally drops her guard and the two become quick friends and soon start to fall in love but Frank's daughter bitter with jealousy refuses to let their relationship go anywhere.Perhaps I missed something or the entire film went over my head but the back of the DVD case called this a sensitive comedy romance and a couple other film books I owned called this a bittersweet romantic comedy but I certainly didn't find any comedy in The Black Orchid. Why this film would be called a comedy is beyond me but it's certainly romantic in the sense of meeting two lonely people who must travel a hard road and learn tough lessons before seeing a greener field.The movie has its heart in the right place although near the end things start to tumble a little bit. The biggest key to the film is its two stars who both turn in wonderfully charming performances. Sophia Loren has always been known for her beauty which is in pull blossom here but she also manages to be quite believable as the distraught widow trying to make good for her troubled son. Loren does a very good job during various quiet scenes where she must confront her past and she also fairs very well in her louder bleaker moments where she's trying to push people away from her.The key highlight to the film is Anthony Quinn who was an actor who never received enough praise for his work. Quinn gives one of the most charming performances I've ever seen in a film and this here really brings the relationship of all the characters together. No matter who he's sharing the screen with Quinn sells the viewer on each subject brought up and we can't help but want him to smile and be happy no matter what. Quinn features a certain grace that makes him appear to float through his scenes and this adds all the believability that a viewer will need.They certainly don't have star chemistry like this any more and that's one shame when it comes to people refusing to watch older films. Director Martin Ritt Norma Rae Stanley  Iris does a very nice job at holding the film together and not letting the melodrama become too thick although his selection for the music score is really distracting. The score seems to be something from The Twilight Zone which really isn't needed here. The biggest problem with the film is the forced if cute ending and some of the scenes with the daughter become very obnoxious and annoying. Other than that The Black Orchid offers two great stars the ability to shine and create a wonderfully quiet little film that has enough charm to make it worth watching.".

	schema:headline " Quinn and Loren Shine in Melodramatic Soap Opera";
	schema:reviewBody "An early effort by director Martin Ritt The Black Orchid is an unconvincing melodrama about the romance between a widow and a widower. Each has a child that complicates the situation although the widower's daughter provides most of the roadblocks to the couple's happiness. Filmed in black and white by Hitchcock favorite Robert Burks the story is predictable and often frustrating and annoying. The widower's daughter played by Ina Balin evidently suffers from mental illness although professional help is not sought. She locks herself in her room to protest her father's involvement with the widow she walks out on her fianc after he refuses impossible living arrangements and she is obsessed with maintaining her hold on her father and his life. The character is unsympathetic and most fathers would have put her on an analyst's couch while most fiancs would have seen what the future held and walked out.However the film cannot be completely dismissed because the widow is played by Sophia Loren at her most beautiful despite a nearly allblack wardrobe and the widower is played by Anthony Quinn who is wonderfully appealing in a rugged lovable way. Physically and emotionally Loren and Quinn make a fine pair and their performances rise above the problematic material. Quinn particularly has a difficult time making his character believable. That such an imposing forceful man would allow his daughter to ruin his life is hard to swallow especially when the happiness of the widow her son and his daughter's fianc also hang in the balance. Loren is on firmer ground in a role that takes the actress from mourning a dead husband to the joy of newfound romance. Her strong performance foreshadows her later work in Marriage Italian Style. Loren's famous eyes are on full display and the actress seems wise and earthy beyond her years. Perhaps Quinn's performance was not acting because who could fail to fall for Sophia.The movie moves back and forth between sets and locations. Although the sets are well designed their stagy nature is jarring when the action moves outdoors. Few actors stand out beyond the leads except for a matchmaking neighbor amusingly played by Naomi Stevens. The screenplay by Joseph Stefano better known for Psycho borders on soap opera and seems conceived for the stage. Like a welloiled episode of As the World Turns The Black Orchid moves slowly to a predictable if unconvincing conclusion that extols the power of sausage which is perhaps a symbolic key to the daughter's emotional problems. However despite its flaws the magnificent stars ultimately redeem the film and save it from the dustbin of Hollywood history. Unfortunately Loren and Quinn no longer grace the screen but fortunately their shadows linger and enhance even otherwise lackluster films such as this one.".

Too many films feature everything but fine actingso this one is a great lesson to aspiring actors and folks who want to learn to appreciate more than explosions and the like.The film begins with the death of a gangster. He's left a mixed up son and a beautiful but mixed up wife Sophia Loren. Because of some sense of guilt for pushing her husband to succeed he chose organized crimeand now she feels responsible for killing him. Her penance is to shut herself away from the world and be miserable. However a gregarious widower Anthony Quinn is determined to break through this wall. He figures that they both are lonely and they should make a go of it.When it comes to Loren's change from closed and unhappy to falling in love with Quinn this is probably the weakest point in the film. It happens very quicklyas if some period of time is missing. However considering that their being in love and wanting to get married is NOT the main point of the film this can be forgiven.The hiccup in this relationship is surprisingly not from Loren's son. While he is in reform school he likes the idea of the marriage. The problem is Quinn's adult daughter. She has an almost incestuous bond with her father and she is determined to do anything to prevent him from remarryingeven if it means her losing her own chance for marriage. While this may seem a bit unrealistic as a family therapist such reactions from daughters to the prospect of their widowed fathers remarrying isn't that unusualand is the great basis of a film.All this works together very well due to the acting. Quinn is simply greatvery likable and decent. As for Loren it's one of her earliest English language filmsand she is exceptional. In particular I loved her body language and expressions. As for the rest the ensemble cast is uniformly good. While this is not an exciting film it is very well done and deserves to be seen. A sweet and worthwhile romance that will probably leave you feeling a bit mistyeyed.".

Probably because the film was one of those he directed after being accused of being communist during the McCarthy's hunt. Two stars like Sophia Loren and Anthony Quinn together again for the second time They were acting together in Attila 1954 made the film a good entertainment with a very happy end. Quinn's daughter is too egoist with his father because she does not want to share him with any other woman and once noticed the new relationship with Sophia a widow of a presumably maffia man who also has a son sitting in farm school for children with problems of behavior. Sophia solved the problem Quinn had with his daughter too simple way of solution and Quinn was able to get the sympathy of her son and to take him back with them.

Of course such a format showed off her ample proportions for that mammary obsessed decade. I suspect this little bw production was intended to help establish her as more than a sex goddess. And it does.She's quite good in the deglamorized role of an embittered working widow Rose. Despite her resistance she's being intensely courted by prosperous business man Frank Quinn. Trouble is Frank's daughter Mary Balin is very possessive of dad and also thinks Rose is undeserving of him. So Mary creates problems that jeopardize not only dad's engagement but also her ownto nice guy Noble Richman. If this sounds like tangled relationships it is especially when Rose's delinquent son Baird is added to the mix.Fortunately the movie's well acted and directed Ritt which helps what turns out to be something of a soap opera. The first part comes across as mainly a character study as the hardened widow Rose fends off Frank's persistent gambits. However once the relationships begin to spread and conflict the screenplay takes on a more conventional tone. Also looks like the movie was shot entirely on the Paramount lot. Thus I expect they were able to squeeze it into her hectic schedule. Note too how subtly actress Loren expresses emotions with her eyes. That's probably something guys like me never noticed before. Despite the obscurity in Loren's canon the film works as an engaging showcase for the two leads and is not without its moments.".

But for their respective children the ship of romance would have some smooth sailing.Sophia Loren is a bit young to play a middle aged widow but she carries it off beautifully. She was a bride fresh from Italy when she married her husband and she fell in love with the material wealth of America. It cost her husband his life when he turns to being a gangster to give his wife all she desires. She also shuns and is shunned by the neighborhood.Anthony Quinn is a widower whose wife died years earlier and left him to raise daughter Ina Balin who was making her big screen debut. Although she is engaged to Peter Mark Richman she wants him to move in with her and her father and Richman who has his business in another town wants his own household. As for Loren's kid Jimmy Baird he's on a youth farm for youthful offenders. How he reacts to his mother's new romance is a bit unusual but in keeping with how the adult characters are drawn in this drama.What I liked about Black Orchid is the sheer ordinariness of the people yet some great drama is played out across the screen. No heroes or villains just people going about the day to day business of living. For a writer it's probably the most difficult to find a story with these characters but it is done beautifully in Black Orchid.Case in point. Anthony Quinn and Sophia Loren were together before in the Italian film Attila where Quinn plays the title role the scourge of Europe and Loren is a pulchritudinous and seductive Roman princess. Two totally different types but that's a tribute to the acting ability of the stars.This is a film that should get more attention and maybe it will some day.".

Loren is OK although for me she lacked confidence in some of the quieter moments in which she is called upon to emote without words. But then she was only in her early twenties  a good few years younger than her costar  so perhaps a disparity in the quality of their acting is forgivable.Perhaps the most interesting thing about the movie is that it isn't Rose's tearaway juvenile son Jimmy Baird who proves to be the biggest obstacle to their romance but Quinn's grown daughter Mary Ina Balin who is herself on the verge of marriage. This aspect of the story is also the least convincing and to be honest you just feel like telling her to get over herself and let her Dad get on with his life. Any adult who would deliberately imitate the behaviour of their mother immediately before she the mother committed suicide in order to get their way really deserves no sympathy from the audience and a lot less understanding than they get from the characters here. This situation also lacks any meaningful resolution between father and daughter as it is Rose who finally brings Mary around  and then seals the deal by showing her prospective daughterinlaw how to cook the perfect sausage".

This was changed to Wing  Commander Roy Grant for the film. The script did make it clear that Grant was an ex  Eagle Squadron pilot. A number of Americans did fly for the RAF during WW2. After Pearl Harbour the Eagle Squadrons were eventually transferred to the USAAF but some Americans stayed in the RAF so it is not totally implausible to have an American leading an RAF squadron.I agree that the Greek American actor George Chakiris does not look very Norwegian! However the casting of these two American actors Robertson and Chakiris was done to ensure the success of the film at the American box office. British war films with all British casts tend to bomb at the American box office. The 1969 film Battle of Britain was the most successful film at the UK box office when it came out but it was a financial disaster in most other countries. That was why the American role in Operation Market Garden was prominently featured in the 1977 film A Bridge Too Far.I agree that the ending was ambiguous. In Frederick E Smith's 1976 sequel Operation Rhine Maiden it was made clear that Wing Cdr Grant had survived the crash and become a POW  in the film it is not clear whether he had died or just lost consciousness.All the Mosquitoes used in the film were obtained from No 35 Civilian Anti Aircraft Cooperation Unit in Exeter which retired its last Mosquitoes only a few weeks before filming began. These civilian  piloted Mosquitoes were the last in service anywhere in the world.A total off 11 Mosquitoes were used in the filming though only four were airworthy . Three Mosquitoes were destroyed during filming.A few of the Mosquitoes used in the film still exist though none are currently airworthy. The B25 Mitchell used as the camera plane still exists albeit in a derelict condition at North Weald Airfield in England.".

In this day and age it's often forgotten how these type of film's relied on good aerial photography deft model work and a stirring score. All of which this picture contains thus making 633 Squadron more than a wet day crowd pleaser. Sure the intermittent scenes between the training sequences and the actual mission are mere filler and the subplots obviously halt the flow of the movie hello romance hello sacrifice clichs but what they do do is give a sort of added feel to the proceedings come the mission at the end. We do after all have to have some sort of affinity with the characters putting their lives at risk and we get that here courtesy of a well written first half. Also boasting in my opinion naturally one of the greatest scores used in a War movie courtesy of Ron Goodwin the film triumphs because the ending is all that you hope for. In truth it's never in doubt given the build up we are given and being the normality for many genre pieces but with little dashes of poignancy and slivers of adrenalin rushes the impact is akin to a jingoistic chest thudding.Besides which if you can't get a tingle on your neck watching the Mosquitoes fly over the Norwegian fjord?

	schema:reviewBody "I have a feeling this isn't the only time that Cliff Robertson played the transAtlantic star beefing up a late British war movie for the US market. However Cliff is NOT playing a British squadron leader! There were a large number of Canadian and Australian flyers in British squadrons during WWII. We also have the fleeting appearance in the movie of an Indian pilot. I suspect Cliff is representing a Canadian  though there were also a few US volunteers flying in the RAF in WWII as late as 1944 and in a bomber I'm not so sure about  but its not totally impossible! The real casting problem is George Chakiris. Very GreekItalian and not at all Norwegian in appearance or accent! Also he lacks the screen presence or acting ability of Robertson. Considering his sister's looks I can only assume that there was a Greek milkman in that Norwegian town in the 1930s! Maria Perschy looks suitably Norwegian and stunning and doesn't try too hard for an accent otherwise than educated English  which considering she was Austrian may well have been a very good thing! Oh but the film has real flying scenes of Mosquitos and a flying score to match the Dambusters March so its a film worth watching. The lack of CGI is a huge bonus though it does present us with some very dodgy models in action and the memory they destroyed a few real Mosquitos making the film. It also has one of the most stirring oldfashioned closing lines in film history delivered as only Harry Andrews could.So I'd recommend watching it with critical facilities on 'mute'  enjoy what's there to be enjoyed and ignore the rest of it!!!".

I bought this on DVD in a '3 for 20' offer as I had fond memories of it from childhood and it had been around 20 years since I last remember seeing it. I have to say that it's not nearly as good as I remembered it to be. The plot is full of cliches and there's the inevitable love interest for the lead. That said there are points to recommend it. Cliff Robertson gives another reliable performance as the Wing Commander in charge of the squadron and there are equally dependable turns from Harry Andrews and Donald Houston. The numerous flying sequences with the Mosquito Bombers are expertly filmed and it's a real bonus to finally see the film in its correct 2.351 aspect ratio. The special effects aren't bad for 1964 and Ron Goodwin's famous score underpins the whole venture.   The main problem that I have with the film is that it borrows heavily from 'The Dam Busters' in terms of plot without ever scaling the heights no pun intended of that classic. It may have lush Panavision photography better effects etc. but lacks the nail biting tension and expertly constructed drama of its predecessor. However it's perfectly acceptable entertainment if somewhat abrupt at the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Men of the 633 Squadron of the Royal Air Force have one nasty mission to perform. The Nazis have built a factory deep within a cliff with an overhang on a Norwegian fjord that is making a special fuel for rockets they're developing. The RAF encountered a similar problem in The Guns of Navarone where an overhang protected two large pieces of artillery that was wreaking havoc on allied shipping. They gave up bombing there but the Norwegian resistance brought in a geological consultant who says if they come in low and hit a certain spot with a fissure the whole thing will collapse and bury the factory under tons of rock.The RAF mission come in low and drop bombs enough to crack that fissure. It's a nasty mission for Cliff Robertson and his men even with aid from a ground attack planned by George Chakiris with the Norwegian resistance. What's best about 633 Squadron are the special effects where they used vintage Mosquito fighter planes from World War II. It's really done quite well and is exciting.As usual an American actor is brought in via the RAF Eagle Squadron for foreign pilots who enlisted before Pearl Harbor. In this case it's Cliff Robertson although he's a fine actor isn't exactly box office. Maybe the producers thought he would be as he was just coming off playing John F. Kennedy in PT 109.I'm also not quite sure why the Nazis would locate a fuel for rockets that were to be used in defending the western Europe beach from the invasion in Norway. Maybe they were listening on Winston Churchill who was constantly advocating a Norwegian invasion though American military and his own military told him that wasn't feasible. If it was for a cross channel invasion defense that would have presented a transportation logistics problem for the Germans.In any event it's nice war film with great special effects.".

	schema:reviewBody "I used to love this movie . When I was a child in the 1970s this movie would be shown at least once a year on television and I would always go out of my way to watch it and no matter how many times I saw it I would always enjoy it . It's an exciting war movie involving brave noble men in the RAF and Norwegian resistance giving those cruel Nazis what for . Jolly good show chaps I hadn't seen this movie for years until today but was still interested in seeing it again and was slightly disappointed . Yes it might be exciting to a ten year old child in the 1970s but as an adult my critical faculties was instantly able to notice what's wrong with this movie The screenplay feels rather disjointed as it jumps about from location to location and it almost feels like a storyboard rather than a completed script since the scenes seem to finish and start in an unnatural manner . This might actually be the fault of the editing rather than the screenplay because things might be spliced together in the wrong order . Take for example the scene where the airfield is attacked by the Germans  The Luftwaffe could launch attacks on English airfields in 1944 ? Highly unlikely  which then cuts to the bar later that day where everyone is drinking and singing and laughing and where no one refers to the attack . It's as if the previous scene had never happened and is undoubtedly a blunder by the film makers It's by no means unique to this movie but another noticeable aspect when viewed today as an adult is how poor and dated the FX are . Cut to a Mosquito aircraft in mid flight then cut to the interior of the cockpit which is obviously a studio set with some painfully obvious back screen projection and of course there's the very obvious model aircraft which is a common flaw with airborne war movies from this period All this makes a long cherished movie like 633 SQUADRON rather disappointing when viewed today but it's by no means a terrible movie . Ron Goodwin's score still remains impressive and some of the scenes were reworked into a little known film from 1977 called STAR WARS so it can't be all bad . If people are complaining that one of the Norwegians looks Greek then they must try getting out a bit more".

I watched it for the planes A friend my parents had been a Mosquito pilot and had told some great war stories so I already knew about what a great plane it was. Many Mosquitoes were built in Canada by DeHavilland during the war. One of my airplane magazines Air Classics did a photo story on how the producers had scratched together the planes for 633 Squadron  apparently they found 8 or so around the world one I believe mouldering away in Mexico or Central America. It looks like they only got two or three actually airworthy for the shoot  and I suspect the unairworthy ones were used for the fiery crash scenes. Seen again recently the movie has high production values reasonable technical authenticity except for that Land Rover hiding in the shrubs in one shot but is encumbered by the all the Hollywood tripe. And while I can excuse Me108s playing 109s the model work is indeed pretty crappy most of the time. The real pleasure of the movie is the precious few shots of the real Mosquitoes in action which makes the rest of the nonsense tolerable. Why they couldnt have done a real Mossie story  such as the real precisionbreaching of a Gestapo prison wall   I don't know.".

I remembered Ron Goodwin's stirring martial score Maria Perschy's slightly unorthodox beauty George Chakiris's Hollywood hair do and nocando performance and most of all the sleek and noisy power of the halfdozen or so De Havilland Mosquitoes sailing through the fossate Fjords of Norway to bomb hell out of the plant making fuel for Nazi V1 rockets.Cliff Robertson is the squadron CO and gives a professional performance. Most of the other faces are familiar from British films of the times as is the make up of the squadron itself. Robertson is an American and there are New Zealanders Australians Norwegians and a bearded and beturbaned Sikh.Chakiris is the Norwegian liaison officer with the squadron. Perschy is his sister. When Chakiris returns to Norway to organize a resistance effort against the German flak guns surrounding the fuel plant he's captured and tortured by the Gestapo. Robertson puts an end to his pain by demolishing Gestapo headquarters and Chakiris along with it.This mission  along with the final suicide run against the plant  are likely to strike some viewers as coming directly from a comic book yet Mosquitoes were used more than once for just such precision bombing. They were queer airplanes. There was nothing quite like them. Rather than metal they were built of plywood and fabric and on many missions went unarmed because their top speed was enough for them to outfly most pursuers.Yet the flight scenes which should be exhilarating are flawed because of the obvious model work. When an airplane explodes it pops into fragments that look like cardboard. And the scenes in the cockpit showing the pilot and navigator are static and give a distinct impression that we're looking at a mock up. Oh it's not Plan Nine From Outer Space but it's noticeable and tends to spoil our involvement in events.The director is Walter Grauman. The screenplay is by Howard Koch and James Clavell both famous names. No one would argue that the plot is logically worked out. The bombing of Gestapo headquarters is from 13 Rue Madeleine. The pilots drinking beer and carousing in the Black Swan is spavined. Robertson and Perschy fall into each other's arms on the first date. We never discover how the Germans learned that the Norwegian resistance planned to attack the antiaircraft gun emplacements at a particular time. Every one of the Mosquitoes is lost on the final mission and the best the Wing Commander Harry Andrews can come up with is You can't kill a squadron. Oh no? On the whole it resembles a cross between The Dam Busters and The Guns of Navarone without the gloss of either. Still there are few dull moments and the thing zips along with plenty of zest. And those Mosquitoes  stunning airplanes for their time versatile and with a maximum speed of more than 370 miles per hour. Admirable in every way except for that nugatory romance.".

But they may have all been bested by the one I saw last night. The Girl Rebel Force of Competitive Swimmers. A mouthful but also a great damn name for a movie. Too bad that the name and some nudity is the only thing going for it.The story revolves around a virus of sorts that is turning all the nonswimmers at the school into zombies. Some talkative some not. Actually the teachers talk and the students don't when they're zombified. Anywho throw in a mysterious new girl and a backstory with her and some mad doctor and you have the flick.The story doesn't sound that bad right? Well the story isn't the bad part it's pretty creative. But damn like Chaos's review asks how on Earth can they screw this type of movie up? I was expecting at least something on the level of Wild ZeroMeatball Machine type production values. But it's really just a completely amateurish flick. And surprisingly what hurt it most was the gore. It just sucked. Like the films I just mentioned those flicks were weirdsilly flicks but the gore looked good and you were amped to see more. But with this I really didn't even want to watch any more scenes of gore. Because it looked that weak. I think they showed the same awfullooking severed arm on three separate occasions. The writing and gore were just too damn amateurish to be given a pass.Though the flick wasn't all bad it had some nice nudity by the lead actress. She was very very good looking and looked fantastic in even a one piece swimsuit. And her boobs which I'd assume are fake rare for Japanese girls were really great looking. And the lesbo scene between her another swimmer was definitely attention worthy. Ahhhhtennnnhut!!Overall this flick was really a letdown. With a great title some great shots of hot Asian chicks swimming it up some lovely Japanese breasts and butt and a more than capable story the film definitely had potential. But with such a strong amateurish feel some bad writing far too much melodrama and completely unimpressive gore effects the movie relies solely on scenes of nudity. Which isn't good if you're watching a flick called The Girl REBEL FORCE of Competitive Swimmers. Look instead for Machine Girl or the highly anticipated Tokyo Gore Police for some whacked out Asian craziness.".

She was very very good looking and looked fantastic in even a one piece swimsuit. And her boobs which I'd assume are fake rare for Japanese girls were really great looking. And the lesbo scene between her another swimmer was definitely attention worthy. Ahhhhtennnnhut!!Overall this flick was really a letdown. With a great title some great shots of hot Asian chicks swimming it up some lovely Japanese breasts and butt and a more than capable story the film definitely had potential. But with such a strong amateurish feel some bad writing far too much melodrama and completely unimpressive gore effects the movie relies solely on scenes of nudity. Which isn't good if you're watching a flick called The Girl REBEL FORCE of Competitive Swimmers. Look instead for Machine Girl or the highly anticipated Tokyo Gore Police for some whacked out Asian craziness.";

I know when I'm being hunted by zombies I often talk about sporting events that are coming up. Then they have lesbiansex. I know that when I'm being hunted by zombies I have...wait...I'm a guy never mind.The scene in the classroom where the math teacher slices up his nonzombie students with meter sticks while his zombie students feed upon the nonzombie students is just too weird. The zombie female teacher who speaks some English is also just too weird as she kills with a machete.The main character is a water warrior master who has escaped her master so that she can live a life like all high school seniors her age. We learn she is a new student at the school about 10 minutes into the movie which makes the ending even more confusing.The scene with the rapemaster and his flute is laughable. He plays his flute while his 'slave' fondles her genitals...she does moan and squeal well but that's about it. Then he has sex with her.If you think this review was disjointed the movie is 100x more so. It's funny in places and just twisted and bizarre in others.

I think lowbudget American filmmakers or um videomakers are actually beginning to catch on to this Japanese extreme sexandviolence hybrid formula with recent movies like Bad Biology and Black Devil Doll.This movie also has a few funny sequences like the zombified math teacher who babbles some word problem about apples and then cuts off the head of a student with a samurai sword when he doesn't like her answer.

The violencethe goreis rather disappointing cheap with the director forced into pulling away when a blade is slicing flesh or a cinder block bashes which bashes a face in.

It do contains a lot of red stuff and here and there we do have a bit of gory scene's but for Japanese standards it's low and most of the slashing or killings are done offscreen. The acting didn't provided any extra. You don't watch those movies for the acting. But being low on the gore site there are much better flicks out.But if you are into those typical Japanese flicks with student lookalikes then this is one to see. Of course it sometimes goes over the top with the sputtering of blood and some girls really get covered with the red stuff. The end is also over the top with a girl having extra powers coming out of her well you can guess it.

Sayaka has rather persuasive method so she joins the swim team. She soon finds out that the everyone is turning into zombies but for some reason only the swim team is unaffected. They form rebel force of their own to combat the zombies.There are gratuitous lesbian scenes and nude scenes all over this movie. It's hard to judge if this movie was made to show the naked bodies or tell the story. Maybe it's useless to try and figure out which is which but one thing this movie doesn't fail is to entertain. The girls are beautiful and the comedy is superb. There are bit of a gore also but you can easily tell that it's fake.IMO this is the best movie Sasa Handa has starred in. It's a unique mixture of sex gore and high school girls in a story unlike any other I've seen.This is an uniquely entertaining movie coming from Japan and is highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie masquerades as a murder mystery but is actually a Battle of the Sexes screwball comedy of the first water.Bill Reardon has been pressured by his unrelenting wife Sally to quit his job as a detective for the District Attorney's office and open his own private detective agency. After several months he has no clients and is broke. He finally admits defeat and goes back to working for the DA intending to close the office the next day and leaving his wife to manage it. At the last minute though a client Mrs. Fraser comes into the detective agency. Desperate for income Sally masquerades as Operative 7 and convinces Mrs. Fraser to give her the case.The rest of the movie is the rivalry between Sally and Bill each trying to top the other at solving the same case. The inexperienced Sally's methods are extremely unorthodox to say the least and usually end up backfiring on her as they lead her at full tilt on a merry chase through a web of gambling blackmail and murder. Bill's methods are more traditional and he has all the horsepower of the local police department at his disposal but somehow he always ends up involuntarily and much to his chagrin following a trail that Sally has blazed earlier.There is a sequel to this film There's That Woman Again this time with Virginia Bruce in the part of Sally.Who could imagine any more urbane sophisticated man of the world than Melvyn Douglas in Ninotchka? Here as Bill Reardon he is just as handsome but ends up coming off as somewhat of a boob rather easily manipulated by his wife's scheming machinations and constantly at the end of his rope over them. This shows off his talent for comedy even better than his role in Ninotchka can.Bumbling foil or not he does end up being the one to solve the crime in the end though.Mary Astor is quite watchable as Mrs. Fraser playing a hardedged role of the type she is so good in chilly and mysterious but with aspects of a vulnerable victim at the same time.Joan Blondell somehow manages to play the screwball heroine Sally Reardon without any of the cloying suffocation of Ida Lupino in Lone Wolf Spy Hunt or the stark frightfulness and outright psychosis of Katharine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby. I could never understand what any man would see in either of the latter two. I would run as far as I could as fast as I could in the opposite direction from both of them. But Blondell retains an allure and a lovableness throughout all her antics in spite of her headstrong independent disruptive ways. It is pretty easy to understand why Bill puts up with everything he does from her and still wants her back after each debacle.When Joan Blondell is funny she is really quite excellent at it. And this is the best I've seen of her rivaling Topper Returns or perhaps even outdoing her performance there. Although admittedly I have only seen a fraction of the 59 movies she made in the 1930s  an average of 6 movies a year! She is clearly the centerpiece of this comedy and handles it masterfully never dropping the ball and leading the viewer around by the nose just as easily and continuously as she does her husband.But the real incandescence of this film is the unexpected zingers that are delivered usually offhand and usually as the wrapup of a scene. They are always unexpected very clever and made me laugh out loud on many more than a couple of occasions. Watch closely for them all as they are easy to miss. They are every bit as witty as anything in any of the Thin Man or Boston Blackie movies.A very funny movie.One warning those who are sensitive to any allusion to spousal physical abuse however playful will not enjoy this movie.".

In many ways Joan Blondell and Melvin Douglas play characters like Nick and Nora Charles from the Thin Man seriesexcept that instead of working together they work against each other through much of the film.The film begins with Douglas owning his own detective agency. However he has no clients and is forced to go back to his old job as an investigator for the District Attorney's office. However when his wife Blondell is alone in the soon to be vacated detective office a perspective client entersand she decides to take the case herself. After all she thinks if she can solve the case then maybe the agency could succeedand make Douglas happy because he would rather be a private detective.In a funny scene the couple goes out for a night on the town. Douglas does not know that his wife is working a case and she spends the evening keeping an eye on a suspect for her client. The problem is that the next day the client's husband is found dead and Blondell investigates it for her client while Douglas also investigates it for the D.A.and he STILL doesn't know she's involved. In fact many times she uses her inside track to trying to solve the crime. When Douglas finally wises up to what's going on the sparks really fly.What I particularly liked about the film is that while Blondell is sometimes very clever other times she's a total moron. Too often in these sort of films the wife is too smart and too competent. Here however both Douglas and Blondell have their strengths and deficits. I also loved the great dialog between themit's very well written and funny. In particular however since they are supposed to be married Douglas is NOT the most gentlemanly guyoften tossing his wife around and even having her arrested.Overall while the mystery isn't that mysterious the characters and acting are very goodmaking this an enjoyable little rompand nearly earning an 8 this was a close one.".

William Reardon Douglas is deciding if he wants to stay in the private eye business when wife Sally Blondell comes along and interferes in all his business. This one is a little more edgey and biting than the Thin Man here they have it out and it's not alway quite the same gentle kidding tone that Thin Man has. I wondered if this film had been written by the same team as Thin Man but it appears it was completely different writers. Viewers will recognize Mary Astor who started in silent films and made many films including several with Bogart Maltese Falcon Across the Pacific. Blondell will probably be most well known for Three on a match and Desk Set. Interesting that both of Melvyn Douglas' Oscars were for Best Supporting Roles much later in his career.".

The smart part can be debated as it is not constant but this film was made in the 1930s. The cast was very good but there is no William Powell. I don't care how many awards he won Melvyn Douglas is no William Powell. And neither is Joan. There is no Myrna Loysubordinate wife character which takes us back to why my wife liked this so. If you are reading this review chances are you'll like this film. It has the charm we can always find in comedies of this period and Joan is wonderful as always.

The humor here is much broader than the dry sarcastic wit of Powell and Loy.

Nonetheless with her huge cartoonlike eyes her beautiful face her nice voice her constant energy you still can't take your eyes off her. In one word she is delightful. Her costar Melvyn Douglas mostly has to play the straight man and react to her zaniness with a mix of frustration anger and affection but he does it well. The film has some hilarious moments watch what happens when Blondell gets overzealous trying to listen into a conversation but the mystery is not exactly phenomenal though it isn't bad either and it does drag at times in the second half movies of this type usually benefit from a shorter running time than a full 80 minutes. 12 out of 4.".

	schema:headline " Yet Another Putrid Comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "I must sound like a broken record but once again this horrid film proves that Hollywood simply cannot make a decent comedy anymore. This one has the same things they all do now tons of juvenile potty humor gratuitous male nudity and in a rarity a brief topless female and a predictable disastrous message. The male nudity by the way includes a close up view of a male's penis. As usual the males in the film are made out to be the bad guys. Two hapless husbands who are guilty of nothing more than ogling women here and there are granted a hall pass by their wives. This idea comes from their friend played by the odious Joy Behar who is no actress and can barely recite her lines. The men are told that for one week they can do whatever they want and pretend they aren't married while the wives take the kids out of town. In an utterly foreseen twist the guys turn out to not even be capable of talking to girls let alone sleeping with them while their wives are partying up a storm with hot younger athletes. Meanwhile we are treated to a running gag that could have been penned by most third graders of the guys' fat friend constantly uttering I have to poo. In a truly artistic scene we are treated to this man's fat bare bottom taking a dump in a sand trap on a golf course. Talk about hilarious! Owen Wilson eventually turns down the hot 21 year old who had been his children's babysitter her hot 40 something aunt and the gorgeous blonde Australian chick who had been the object of his fantasies. He doesn't even get to kiss any of them. His hapless friend is similarly unlucky. Meanwhile Christina Appelegate as the other husband's wife does sleep with a younger guy. Afterwards she says this can't happen again I love my husband. This is the message that has been coming out of Hollywood for some time now a wife can have an extramarital affair but the husband cannot or at least if he does the marriage is over. We saw this even in Family Guy when Lois slept with Bill Clinton but Peter inexplicably backed out of sleeping with his date so the writers solved that by having Peter sleep with Bill Clinton too. Ugh. When the hapless other husband reunites with Christina Applegate he gets down on his knees and apologizes. For what? the audience might ask. He didn't really do anything wrong. But his wife sure did. And does she admit this or apologize herself? Nope. Guess again she accepts his ridiculous apology with a canarythatatethekitten smile. Nice message there for everyone. This movie was not as awful as the Judd Apatow stuff or quite as unfunny as most of Adam Sandler's and Will Ferrell's gems but it is still thoroughly offensive.".

What seems to be a once in a lifetime chance is tediously squandered by a morallyabiding storyline that ruthlessly eviscerates any hopes of laughing at the mischief these two vacuously avoided. Even the events leading up to the granting of the hall pass are a torturously slow and painful wait devoid of laughter. When the longawaited time comes the build up of expectations for a hilarious ride back into bachelor life climaxes to a loud and noisy sigh of sheer disappointment. It is however a difficult job to create a comedy that aims to entertain under the promise of showing the wildest seven days known to mankind while attempting to somehow squeeze in a lesson of morality here and there. But if you can vicariously derive any pleasure from quotidian activities like playing videogames golf and eating at Applebee's with close friends then by all means this is the perfect film for it. Otherwise save yourself the time and money and discard the hall pass.".

Their thinking is that this will get their husbands to appreciate them more. Is this a good idea?When I was in High School a Hall Pass did not mean I could do whatever I wanted for a day or a week. It just allowed me to go from one classroom to another place within a very short period of time. But this kind of Hall Pass is different. This has a lot of crude rude and outofplace sexual humor. Nothing in here is funny. Nothing. There is male frontal nudity female nudity and a masturbation scene by Fred. Is this what socalled comedies are coming to these days? Seems so. It's bad enough that these socalled comedies are never funny but now we dip into almost xrated dialogue and scenes. There is a place for things of this nature but in a comedy? I need to find my home planet and go there. This is becoming way too much for me. A lot of funny stuff is funny by implication but in here it's all spelled out for you spoken and shown. If you do see this ask yourself would you watch it again with your parents children grandparents? I think not. Violence Yes. Sex Yes. Nudity Yes male and female. Language Yes.".

Being the creative minds behind Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary one can expect a riotous situational comedy with a dash of lewd exposure all while managing to keep a heartwarming undertone that makes it all worth it. Unfortunately Hall Pass keeps the lewd with a dash of comical instances of brilliance while managing to keep the audience wondering when the movie will finally just... stop playing.Rick Owen Wilson the blonde one who's not Luke Wilson and Fred Jason Sudeikis of SNL fame are best buds happily married to wonderful women Maggie Jenna Fischer of The Office and Grace Christina Applegate of Anchorman Married with Children. But things have gotten a little stale in the bedroom and the guys are helpless but to gawk at all the young talent that surrounds them. Darn it if only they weren't married! The wives take note of this behavior and after a lengthy dialogue with a minor character literally detailing the title of the film they pave the way for a wild week of orgies and freedom by issuing their husbands a hall pass a.k.a. a week free from marriage in which they can sow their wild oats. The boys are instantly excited and embrace the idea without any concern for how bad things must be in their marriage to have brought their wives to this point but never mind. Free sex! Except they find that it isn't as easy as they remember to meet women leading to failed attempt after attempt to not only fulfill their fantasies but to even function without the guidance of their wives. Reminiscent of moving out of the house for the first time and instead of mom's meatloaf you're eating Cup o' Noodles for 3 weeks straight. The ladies on the other hand go Maggie's father's summer home for the week and party with a visiting Minor League baseball team and play volley ball and shotgun beer and are flirted with constantly and... well you get the point.Ultimately the film slumps along from one scene to the next segmented together in a shrewd manner. The film's crippling weakness isn't that a majority of the jokes are asinine for even a Farrelly Brother film or that the plot is overly contrived but that the characters we're meant to invest in just aren't interesting or agreeable or worth a 10 admission. Being a fan of Wilson and especially of Sudeikis the characters they played were severely underwritten for their talents. They didn't seem to capture the bumbling 40yearold thinking he could still be a 20yearold effect and just came across as bumbling 40year olds pretending to be 60yearolds thinking they could be 20yearolds. Fischer and Applegate were also underwritten and thus made it hard to really invest in their characters as well.While there are a few memorable moments involving a hipster troll working at a coffee shop and Stephen Merchant being Stephen Merchant for 5 minutes Hall Pass just does not deserve to be excused from its poor execution.1.5 Hawaiian shirts out of 5MovieFloss.com".

	schema:headline " Go Get Your Hall Pass";
	schema:reviewBody "Have you ever wondered what happened to the crew of guys from the first American Pie movie? After they lost it I often wonder what happened after they got married and had kids and moved out to the suburbs. What happened 20 years later when they were no longer the Big Men on Campus? Thanks to the new release by the Farrelly brothers Bobby and Peter who also brought us Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin we are now able to see the rest of the story. Hall Pass is by no means a sequel in the American Pie series but both films did remind me of how most men are wired for sexual conquests from puberty onward. Hall Pass captured America's well known character  the middle age suburbanite male and gave him a hall pass. A hall pass is a weeklong excuse for married men to behave badly drink to excess and sleep with whomever. We start the movie with Rick played by Owen Wilson and Fred played by Jason Sudeikis attending an award banquet with their wives. They think they have the scopingchicksoutinsecret scheme down perfectly while their wives know what dogs they really have become over the years. It's not that Rick and Fred are totally miserable in their marriages but they think that they could be getting some serious action if they weren't tied down. Fred has even resorted to finding a way to relieve some of his sexual tensions in his car. Their wives Maggie played by Jenna Fischer and Grace played by Christina Applegate speak with a psychiatrist friend of theirs who gives them the idea of letting their husbands have a week off of their marriage so that they can carouse and let some of their male tendencies rule. At the end of the week they come back and have stronger marriages because of the freedom. Hey I am sure it works in theory. Once the guys are loose they have some troubles getting back in the game. They are like two disoriented bulls in a china shop they neither have any idea how they got there nor how to move around with any tact. The week moves quickly with the guys bar hopping at family restaurants. They embark on a hilarious golf outing after eating some brownies laced with pot. By the third night they are called out on their manhood by their friends. Rick and Fred like a lot of guys talk a big game but have very little action to back up their smack talk. While the boys are trying their hardest using tasteless pickup lines and getting drunk to build their confidence the wives are being themselves and living it up with a minor league baseball team in Cape Cod. As an indirect result to allowing the husbands go out the wives are also permitted a hall pass. However the wives aren't as shameless about their newfound freedom. The movie moves on with many quotable one liners and quite a few shock moments. But it wouldn't be a true Farrelly brothers' movie without one or two shock moments. Remember the hair gel scene in There's Something About Mary? The same goes with Hall Pass with a lot of big risks comes a lot of big rewards for the audience. Should you see this movie? Yes. The actors played off of each with ease. Along with a wellwritten script it all came together for several big laughs. However if you are not comfortable with sexual references or outlandish sight gags this might not be the film for you. If you are the type to laugh at American Pie Superbad Step Brothers or any other over the top comedy then this would definitely be a pick for you.".

We start the movie with Rick played by Owen Wilson and Fred played by Jason Sudeikis attending an award banquet with their wives. They think they have the scopingchicksoutinsecret scheme down perfectly while their wives know what dogs they really have become over the years. It's not that Rick and Fred are totally miserable in their marriages but they think that they could be getting some serious action if they weren't tied down. Fred has even resorted to finding a way to relieve some of his sexual tensions in his car. Their wives Maggie played by Jenna Fischer and Grace played by Christina Applegate speak with a psychiatrist friend of theirs who gives them the idea of letting their husbands have a week off of their marriage so that they can carouse and let some of their male tendencies rule. At the end of the week they come back and have stronger marriages because of the freedom. Hey I am sure it works in theory. Once the guys are loose they have some troubles getting back in the game. They are like two disoriented bulls in a china shop they neither have any idea how they got there nor how to move around with any tact. The week moves quickly with the guys bar hopping at family restaurants. They embark on a hilarious golf outing after eating some brownies laced with pot. By the third night they are called out on their manhood by their friends. Rick and Fred like a lot of guys talk a big game but have very little action to back up their smack talk. While the boys are trying their hardest using tasteless pickup lines and getting drunk to build their confidence the wives are being themselves and living it up with a minor league baseball team in Cape Cod. As an indirect result to allowing the husbands go out the wives are also permitted a hall pass. However the wives aren't as shameless about their newfound freedom. The movie moves on with many quotable one liners and quite a few shock moments. But it wouldn't be a true Farrelly brothers' movie without one or two shock moments. Remember the hair gel scene in There's Something About Mary? The same goes with Hall Pass with a lot of big risks comes a lot of big rewards for the audience. Should you see this movie? Yes. The actors played off of each with ease. Along with a wellwritten script it all came together for several big laughs. However if you are not comfortable with sexual references or outlandish sight gags this might not be the film for you. If you are the type to laugh at American Pie Superbad Step Brothers or any other over the top comedy then this would definitely be a pick for you.";

	schema:reviewBody "I remember that there was a time in which I was enthusiastic to see the phrase A new movie from codirectors Peter and Bobby Farrelly! but that was 10 years ago. The Farrelly bros. made four brilliant comedies in a row Dumb and Dumber Kingpin There's Something About Mary and Me Myself and Irene and back in that time many people including me considered them as the kings of the modern cinematographic comedy. However it seems that the time diluted the sense of humor they showed in those four movies or maybe the commercial success impulsed them to evolute to a less coarse and more emotional style which would eventually be usurped by director Judd Apatow and his imitators. Anyway I found the films they made after Me Myself and Irene to be insipid comedies with trite scatological humor and cloying emotions. Now Hall Pass is another mediocre comedy in their filmography but I found it to be much better than their two previous films Fever Pitch 2005 and The Heartbreak Kid 2007.The screenplay from Hall Pass is too predictable and a bit weak but that is partially redeemed by some good moments of reflexive comedy. On the other side of the coin we also have too many apparatus scenes of slapstick and vulgarity which feel too forced. Something which was done well by the Farrelly bros. in Hall Pass was filling some supporting roles with exaggerated characters which satirize very particular strata from North American society. I have to say that the absurd version of the perfect suburban family led by the characters Ed and Britney made me to have some laughs something which is also a merit of the competent performances from Rob Moran and Lauren Bowles and I also liked the character of the classic oldyoung man which is well interpreted by Richard Jenkins.I think it would have been more interesting to see an interpretation of the story told by Hall Pass made with the style of films like Bob  Carol  Ted  Alice or An Unmarried Woman but well I guess that the political correction has became more important for the Farrelly bros. than the narrative irreverence so we can expect in here the trite moral lessons various illogical jokes and forced comic rudeness which already characterize the work from these filmmakers. At least Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis managed to take the maximum advantage out of the mediocre screenplay by bringing good performances something which also applies to Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate as their characters' wives. In summary I did not like Hall Pass very much but at least it did not bore me and it occasionally made me laugh something which makes it worthy of a slight recommendation.".

	schema:headline " Stumbling toward salvation one day at a time";
	schema:reviewBody "'Crazy Heart' is a simple but emotionally resonant movie about a 57yearold alcoholic country singer whose career is on the skids. There's not much to the story but not much is necessary with Jeff Bridges as the singer Bad Blake Colin Farrell as Tommy Sweet his handsome acolyte now a big country music star Maggie Gyllenhaal as Jean Craddock a smalltime New Mexico journalist with a fouryearold boy who has lousy luck with men and falls for Bad and Robert Duvall as Wayne the singer's cleanandsober bartenderprotector.Bridges Gyllenhaal and Farrell have never been better and Duvall is always pure gold. This movie is Bridges' chance to give a master class in acting and he does not disappoint for a minute but he's not alone in the spotlight and the depth of support he gets is what makes Crazy Heart worth watching.A lifelong musician and manytalented artist painting photography ceramics whose thespian preeminence in Hollywood has yet to win him an Oscar Jeff Bridges inhabits the songs he sings on screen as convincingly and seamlessly as he fits into the shambles of a life and mess of a body that is the film's protagonist. This musical integrity is important because Bad Blake is one of those disintegrating performers whose art has not faltered though his life has. The songs he sings are his own and when he's on stage he's alive. The rest of the time he's lying deceiving or numbing out. A great line is when he's asked by Jean where his songs come from and he replies simply Life unfortunately. A parallel to Bridges' work in 'Crazy Heart' is the similarly livedin and authentic performance as a waning dance hall singer by Grard Depardieu in Xavier Giannoli's 'The Singer''Quand j'tais chanteur' a richly atmospheric little film released but barely seen in the US. But the milieu here is very different and as American as 'The Singer's' is French. First time director Scott Cooper has said this movie tells Merle Haggard's' story and Kris Kristofferson's and Waylon Jennings'. As Bad Blake Jeff moves like Waylon he has Merle Haggard's songwriting ability and Kris Kristofferson's charisma. Of course Bridges looks a lot like Kristofferson and Bad Blake puts his hard times into his felt authentic compositions as Waylon and Merle did. The songs are composed by T Bone Burnett and are fine more authenticity is added through other songs such as Townes Van Zandt's If I Needed You and Waylon Jennings' Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way. Burnett composed the songs with the late Stephen Bruton and the closing ballad The Losing Kind with Ryan Bingham. Farrell as well as Bridges does his own singing and his Irishness merges fairly convincingly into a slick country style.

	onyx:emotionText "'Crazy Heart' is a simple but emotionally resonant movie about a 57yearold alcoholic country singer whose career is on the skids. There's not much to the story but not much is necessary with Jeff Bridges as the singer Bad Blake Colin Farrell as Tommy Sweet his handsome acolyte now a big country music star Maggie Gyllenhaal as Jean Craddock a smalltime New Mexico journalist with a fouryearold boy who has lousy luck with men and falls for Bad and Robert Duvall as Wayne the singer's cleanandsober bartenderprotector.Bridges Gyllenhaal and Farrell have never been better and Duvall is always pure gold. This movie is Bridges' chance to give a master class in acting and he does not disappoint for a minute but he's not alone in the spotlight and the depth of support he gets is what makes Crazy Heart worth watching.A lifelong musician and manytalented artist painting photography ceramics whose thespian preeminence in Hollywood has yet to win him an Oscar Jeff Bridges inhabits the songs he sings on screen as convincingly and seamlessly as he fits into the shambles of a life and mess of a body that is the film's protagonist. This musical integrity is important because Bad Blake is one of those disintegrating performers whose art has not faltered though his life has. The songs he sings are his own and when he's on stage he's alive. The rest of the time he's lying deceiving or numbing out. A great line is when he's asked by Jean where his songs come from and he replies simply Life unfortunately. A parallel to Bridges' work in 'Crazy Heart' is the similarly livedin and authentic performance as a waning dance hall singer by Grard Depardieu in Xavier Giannoli's 'The Singer''Quand j'tais chanteur' a richly atmospheric little film released but barely seen in the US. But the milieu here is very different and as American as 'The Singer's' is French. First time director Scott Cooper has said this movie tells Merle Haggard's' story and Kris Kristofferson's and Waylon Jennings'. As Bad Blake Jeff moves like Waylon he has Merle Haggard's songwriting ability and Kris Kristofferson's charisma. Of course Bridges looks a lot like Kristofferson and Bad Blake puts his hard times into his felt authentic compositions as Waylon and Merle did. The songs are composed by T Bone Burnett and are fine more authenticity is added through other songs such as Townes Van Zandt's If I Needed You and Waylon Jennings' Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way. Burnett composed the songs with the late Stephen Bruton and the closing ballad The Losing Kind with Ryan Bingham. Farrell as well as Bridges does his own singing and his Irishness merges fairly convincingly into a slick country style. Just as Bad Blake is the mentor of Tommy Sweet in real life Robert Duvall has become a mentor of the actorwriterdirector so his presence anchors the film and presides over it. Bridges knew of the movie but held off from committing to it till he learned his friend Burnett was in so this is project that must have felt right ultimately for all concerned.Bridges' Bad Blake is so authentically blousy and pathetic he's hard to look at sometimes.

	schema:headline " Jeff Bridges is absolutely amazing";
	schema:reviewBody "Here is the film that the ridiculously talented Jeff Bridges finally won an Oscar for and deservedly so. His performance is the gleaming highlight of this film in the best way possible. He is playing washed up country singer Bad Blake trying to overcome alcoholism and a dying career. The story is very touching and how could you expect anything less than incredible from a character study piloted by Jeff Bridges. The film has a very organized focus on Bridges' character but he is also backed by a fantastic supporting cast. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays an aspiring reporter who interviews Blake only to fall in love with him shortly after. Her performance is equally touching and feels so real alongside Bridges. Colin Farrell plays Tommy Sweet an old friendship of Bad Blake's that went sour somewhere along the line. And then of course there is the small yet significant role of Bad Blake's long time old fishing buddy Wayne played by the masterful Robert Duvall. The limited number of scenes between Bridges and Duvall are some of the best and most sincere of the movie. Crazy Heart is a great film to watch in order to see fantastic actors do what they do best... act.The character development in Crazy Heart embodies the film's strong suit which is the wonderful acting ability of the cast. There is not a moment when you don't believe in these characters and you truly feel that they are sincere and real. It is also just so incredibly satisfying to watch legends like Bridges and Duvall act side by side in beautiful and perfectly fitting roles such as these. The story of Bad Blake itself is very interesting but the characters are where the heart and soul of the film lay. The plot leaves something to be desired but it doesn't fault the movie as much as it could when you have such great actors filling the roles of such articulated characters. Admittedly the film drags a bit towards the middle and the climax of the film doesn't hit as hard as I would have liked but it leads into a cathartic and slightly cheesy ending which leaves you wanting more but emotionally satisfying nonetheless.Now I am not a fan of country music at all but in the context of this film I absolutely loved it. It is so beautiful and touching that it would almost be a crime to say you didn't like the music while watching its fitting place in this film. And as if I haven't praised the actors in this film enough I have to give even more kudos to Bridges and Farrell who took voice lessons to sing their own songs in the film and holy crap do they sound amazing. You would think Jeff Bridges had been a country singer all his life. If you're not a fan of country music I wouldn't recommend listening to the music before you see the movie. But after you see just how perfect the soundtrack fits the film you will love the music. The music makes this film all the more sincere and is one of the only contexts I will ever enjoy country music.Crazy Heart isn't perfect but I'm willing to go as far to say that Jeff Bridges is. I can get past the imperfections of the storyline and the slight melodramatic feel the last third of the film emanates when the film boasts a cast as good as this. This is a solid film that is a pure delight to watch. And best of all it nabbed Jeff Bridges a long overdue Oscar win.".

	schema:reviewBody "In his directorial debut Scott Cooper adapts Thomas Cobb's Crazy Heart the story of Bad Blake a washedup country star with an alcohol addiction. The film stars Jeff Bridges in the lead role and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Jean a young reporter is taken in by Blake's heartache and pain.Cooper's direction is of subtle greatness. The film is quiet slowpaced but works. It's never meant to be loud or overthetop which some may be expecting it's a beautiful written song about life thrust into a twohour sympathy riot. Bridges who will surely receive Oscar attention is reserved charismatic and raw. Bridges' 58yearold Blake is one of the better performances of the year. There are obvious comparisons to Robert Duvall's performance Tender Mercies with critics believing a possibly similarity to Mickey Rourke's work in The Wrestler which is certainly not the case this is unique in its own way. Bridges doesn't overcook the role which would have been easy he's effortless and sings quite well.Maggie Gyllenhaal Oscar snubbed for her works in Sherrybaby and World Trade Center is nearly average in her work. She's coy with Jean and underplays her but unlike Bad Blake her role doesn't call for it. Jean is a bruised kindhearted and devoted mother to her fouryear old son Buddy Jack Nation as cute as can be but uneven in narrative forming.Robert Duvall is brief and nearly ineffectual. As the bar owner Wayne he offers a humanity for Blake outside of woman which is needed in the film but in the end is unmemorable. Also sharing this boat is the talented Colin Farrell who's both likable and adequate but upstaged by scenes with Bridges.The only thing more beautiful than Bridges' performance is the song The Weary Kind which is submission for Best Original Song for the Academy Awards. This is one of the best songs written for a film in the last ten years. Delightful lyrics and exquisitely executed the song one of the rare occasions of the perfect song for a perfect film given the film's nature.While Crazy Heart doesn't offer anything insightful to the realm of cinema it's simple uncomplicated and honest which you can't appreciate. For a first time out Cooper does an admirable job.".

As he cruises into town in his rusty Suburban and empties out his pee bottle he realizes that his manager has booked him to play in a bowling alley where he begins to drink prior to the show. There's a shot of him at the bar that is an exact visual echo of Bridge's most famous character of recent years the similarly boozeaddled Dude from The Big Lebowski famously bellying up to a bowling alley bar talking to a cowboy.

He meets a young journalist Maggie Gyllenhaal who herself has had a rough patch and their bruised romance sees Blake back on some kind of road to life.Bridges inhabits the role as thoroughly as is seemingly possible  he quite simply is Bad Blake.

Cooper's script has a habit of freely dipping into the well of clich  the whisky soaked forgotten crooner lost in the shadow of inauthentic new country salvation and sobriety at the feet of a sad single mother who doesn't want to be hurt again  but then at the last minute swerving away into if not original then certainly less clichd territory. Tommy Sweet when he makes his entrance into the story is not half the villain the first half of the film would have you believe and Gyllenhaal's single mom is something a hair's breadth more interesting than a sucker for punishment loyal to a fault. The film could have been a disaster and at times it's halfway there but there are enough smart choices in the script and good performances from interesting actors that the film ends up for the most part overcoming its own flaws.It does country well and it's as authentic as a film can be to a genre of music like punk or metal or rap that is itself so utterly clich ridden that arguments over whether soandso is real country are a common fervent pastime for fans and the artists themselves. Bad Blake seems as much of a real breathing human being as Merle Haggard or Waylon Jennings which is obviously somewhat of a backhanded compliment. Crazy Heart's story is an old one a busted down down and out nobody screws up hits bottom and becomes somebody again. We've seen it before but it has enough soul and Bridges' Blake has enough human hitch in his step that it manages to be moving if not refreshing. 710".

By the way who the heck knew that Farrelland Bridges for that mattercould sing so well? Bonus the soundtrack is awesome. Interesting cinema synergyRobert Duvall still a working actor at the age of 79 who produced this film and has a small supporting role won a Best Actor Oscar in 1984 for playing a character similar to Bad Blake in Tender Mercies.";

The good news is the movies can stand on their own terms but somehow at the end of the day I would probably prefer Aronofsky's gritty naturalism over the first time director Scott Cooper's more slick indietreatment with country and wideopen spaces substituting for grisly New Jersey.And yet you should go see Crazy Heart and it's not just for Jeff Bridges as Bad Blake a country musician 57 who has been on hard times for a while and whose main problem alcoholism prevents him from being an unstoppable musical force think Johnny Cash with a little extra blues and kind boyfriend to Jean Gyllenhaal also quite good. Well it could almost be all for him  it's marvelous to see him transform into this character somewhat reminiscent of 'the Dude' but with a more cynical view of life and his former partner Tommy surprisingly done by Colin Farrell and how we really do want him to get better. It's a sympathetic portrait done by a master of American film acting and even if you don't particularly love Country music it's a worthwhile venture to see him in it.That's the other thing the music is actually and this is coming from a notbigfan of Country music save for some exceptions like Cash and Williams quite superb. All of the songs are charged either by a real drive to bring the house down with the joy of playing live or by the tender moments such as the Weary Kind title track which may along with Bridges get TBone Burnett his first Oscar nod. The music is one of the things that makes Blake's journey wonderful to watch even if sadly the story is lacking in ways that other movies not just The Wrestler do much better. Only a third act twist seems to be compelling as the rest of the story kind of coasts the characters along the only roadblock Blake's drinking.As sometimes happens it's a towering performance in the midst of an otherwise competent enjoyable but slight debut feature.

Bridges performance was spot on as a disgusting burnt out drunkard who like Randy 'The Ram' Robinson has to settle for humiliating gigs in noname towns just to keep himself in booze and cigarettes. Good performance. Not amazing. But the rest of the movie goes nowhere and none of us could buy the romance between Bad and Jean played by Maggie Gyllenhal. Maggie's never looked better but instead of channeling Marisa Tomei and looking a little down and out or rough around the edges we are supposed to believe that this perky single mom with an adorable son and neatasapin house would fall in love with an overweight sloppy drunk who drinks 'till he pukes chain smokes and spends his days watching porn. No back story on Jean and why she would be so vulnerable that she'd fall in love with him during an interview.... Mommy was a country music groupie with a crush on Bad? .... Daddy was an alcoholic who ran off on her? .....all we know is that she's made bad choices. Robert Duval plays himself basically. The character actors are believable but not engaging. The one subtle but surprising performance was turned in by Colin Farrell who impresses me more each time I see him. I know I ask a lot of my 12 movie ticket. Next time I'll trust my instincts.".

It's not a secret if you look it up like they did with Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder but this guy's performance was the best in the film so I won't ruin the surprise and name the star here.In the film they keep raving about how great the song that Bad Blake writes for Maggie is called surprise Crazy Heart.

There were too many closeups which always means a shallow story and much of the time we listened to music when we wanted to know more about the characters. The gratuitous sex scene was completely unnecessary and somewhat incredible given the age and condition of the character. The contrived gestures of holding her breast and slipping his hand into her underpants were so forced that they were uninteresting.

This has never been more clearly displayed than in Crazy Heart the first feature by director Scott Cooper the film that won an Oscar for Jeff Bridges. Based on a novel by Thomas Cobb Bridges is country singer Bad Blake who is barely making it as a performer beset by booze a big stomach and an unattractive beard. He was once a famous performer but now is limited to sing in saloons and bowling alleys but still draws a crowd because of his reputation.Although the character doesn't seem to care any more Bridges talent as a performer is so great that the viewer will follow him all the way to the bottom if necessary. Blake is a poet as well as a musician and like Jaques the exiled lord and traveller in Shakespeare's As You Like It can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs. Redemption of sorts however comes in the form of Jean Craddock Maggie Gyllenhall who turns up in his hotel room for an interview. Jean a single mother who has to care for a four yearold son takes a personal interest in Blake and their mutual loneliness and disillusionment brings them together and also pulls them apart. While Crazy Heart is a sweet and gentle film that has a lot of humanity it does not contain the kind of powerful conflict that would set it apart and make it truly memorable. Yet it is a good film that avoids cheap sentimentality and delivers an adult experience for adults not an everyday occurrence in this age of super heroes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Crazy Heart is a fitting title for this movie because Jeff Bridge's is full of crazy heart. I'll be the 1st one to admit it's not original in the slightest. Mickey Rourke did it with The Wrestler and many other people have done it in other genres but Jeff Bridges makes it all worthwhile. I think I could identify with Bad Blake so much is because he kept to himself for the most part. He didn't want any trouble he didn't want anybody really for a while he just wanted to drink his McClure's and smoke his cigarettes he really was a decent man. I thought the whole ordeal and story off Bad falling for JeanMaggie Gyllenhaal and growing a fondness for her son was so well done and it showed the loneliness Bad had deep down. You can see resentment in his eyes when he walks off on Tommy SweetColin Farrell You can see he wants redemption but doesn't really have the courage to do so. It was just a very well done movie and I enjoyed the simple yet powerful story it had.Performances. Jeff Bridges is phenomenal in his role and most certainly deserved his Oscar. Not only is his acting perfect but his singing was also impressive. I felt so many emotions for his character and ended up falling in love with it. Kudos to Mr. Bridges for giving me such a captivating performance. Maggie Gyllenhaal is excellent as Jean the protective mother but also aspiring journalist. Her character isn't as deep as Bridges but she is very vital to the movie's success. Colin Farrell is very good as Tommy Sweet. He didn't have as much screen time as I'd have liked but he did well in his part. Robert Duvall adds a touch of class to everything he's in and here was no different.Bottom line. Crazy Heart is a movie I thoroughly enjoyed. It played with my emotions and it made me smile when it was over. It's nice to see a movie that lives up to the hype once in a while. A must see.910".

The real shortcoming is the script however which takes a dull trite story and magnifies if possible its dullness and triteness.Perhaps the weakest point of the script is the lame lame single mom played by Maggie Gyllenhall the irony that she should get an Academy Award nomination for her worst role ever. The script never establishes a basis for her motivation and the director seems to want to imbue a hopeless script with some life by turning her into coy then bursting into tears because Bad Blake will never remember her. There is zero sexual tension between Gyllenhall and Bridges Gyllenhall is too old for the part anyway but the gap in their ages makes it all faintly ridiculous.Colin Farrell almost steals the show by giving a nuanced performance of a performer with genuine respect for his mentor but ruthless in his goal of keeping top billing. But even he cannot escape the clichs of the script.I didn't see this in the theater because I found the trailer offputting  it looked like a completely predictable rehash of an incredibly trite story.

I know this is not true but it seems like it was ad libbed for most of them. Therefore if it was scripted Bridges deserves an Oscar. But like that Mickey Rourke wrestling flick and some Ryan Gosling shyte about a school teacher it was just a group of disjointed scenes clubbed together to tell a simple story in an artsyfarty way.

	schema:reviewBody "Crazy Heart is written and directed by Scott Cooper and based on the 1987 novel of the same name by Thomas Cobb. It stars Jeff Bridges Maggie Gyllenhaal Colin Farrell  Robert Duvall. Bridges plays Bad Blake a veteran country singersongwriter who is down on his luck but always full of the booze. Embarking on another weary tour of deadend towns his life perks up when he meets young newspaper reporter Jean Craddock Gyllenhaal and her son Buddy Jack Nation.Apparently Bad Blake is based on three real men Waylon Jennings Kris Kristofferson and Merle Haggard. With Scott Cooper saying he had hoped to make a biopic about Haggard but the rights were too difficult to obtain. Of further interest is that the Cobb novel is actually inspired by country singer Hank Thompson.Crazy Heart is the type of movie that crops up from time to time that finds a wide and appreciative audience. That of the human interest story that beats a true and uplifting heart. That Crazy Heart has found the afore mentioned audience is mainly down to Bridges and his very affecting turn as the pathetic drunk resorting to what equates as singing for his beer money. For in truth the story is generic and straight forward and one can guarantee you will have seen this before and done much better in fact. But this is still fine story telling a good movie propelled by rich characterisations Gyllenhaal too is excellent and paced with almost elegiac precision that allows the humanistic elements to carry the audience to a fitting if not surprising finale. There's also value in the music on offer with memorable tunes and note worthy renditions given by Bridges and Farrell. Barry Markowitz's photography also blends nicely with the narrative. His shooting of New Mexico lends itself to beauty and offers hope to Blake's future while the tone down lighting for the dim bars that Bad is singing in brings to the fore the lowness that the singer has now reached. Bridges has done far better work than this but who would deny him the Oscar for Best Actor that duly came his way at ceremony time? It's a great performance tho one that totally engages the viewers. At times infuriating  pathetic yet at others he be charming and grasping our pity by the truck load. That both he and Gyllenhaal make a believable couple is the best compliment one can give them both. Their efforts in this movie deserve a look.A simple redemptive story is lifted to greater heights by Gyllenhaal refusing to let her character be a cipher and Bridges doing heartbreaking like few others can. 710".

Of further interest is that the Cobb novel is actually inspired by country singer Hank Thompson.Crazy Heart is the type of movie that crops up from time to time that finds a wide and appreciative audience. That of the human interest story that beats a true and uplifting heart. That Crazy Heart has found the afore mentioned audience is mainly down to Bridges and his very affecting turn as the pathetic drunk resorting to what equates as singing for his beer money. For in truth the story is generic and straight forward and one can guarantee you will have seen this before and done much better in fact. But this is still fine story telling a good movie propelled by rich characterisations Gyllenhaal too is excellent and paced with almost elegiac precision that allows the humanistic elements to carry the audience to a fitting if not surprising finale. There's also value in the music on offer with memorable tunes and note worthy renditions given by Bridges and Farrell. Barry Markowitz's photography also blends nicely with the narrative. His shooting of New Mexico lends itself to beauty and offers hope to Blake's future while the tone down lighting for the dim bars that Bad is singing in brings to the fore the lowness that the singer has now reached. Bridges has done far better work than this but who would deny him the Oscar for Best Actor that duly came his way at ceremony time? It's a great performance tho one that totally engages the viewers. At times infuriating  pathetic yet at others he be charming and grasping our pity by the truck load. That both he and Gyllenhaal make a believable couple is the best compliment one can give them both. Their efforts in this movie deserve a look.A simple redemptive story is lifted to greater heights by Gyllenhaal refusing to let her character be a cipher and Bridges doing heartbreaking like few others can. 710";

Bad Blake is a self destructive man and is drunkard inveterate smoker overweight and with an untreated cancer and despite the advice of a doctor he does not change his lifestyle.

Sooner Blake needs to return to Houston and Jean and Buddy spend one weekend with him. While walking with the boy Blake brings Buddy to drink in a bar and the boy vanishes. Jean does not forgive Blake and he feels that he needs to treat his addiction. Crazy Heart is a bitter and slowpaced romance with a predictable story and great performances of Jeff Bridges and Maggie Gyllenhaal. The story is moralist and conservative and does not present any surprise or emotion. For those that like countrymusic Jeff Bridges shows a great resemblance with Kris Kristofferson and sings very well many songs. This film is not original or deeper and gloomy like Billy Wilder's Lost Weekend or Blake Edwards' Days of the Wine and Roses but entertains. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Corao Louco Crazy Heart".

	schema:reviewBody "The Girl in the Park was a movie that intrigued me as I came across it in the video store. It was pretty engrossing throughout and the sadness that Sigourney Weaver displayed through the movie saddened me. For me a lot of times lowbudget indie drama's like this are better than big budgeted movies that come from Hollywood. There better produced and made. What I liked most about Girl In The Park was that it never kept you fully satisfied. Enough to make you hope but just enough to keep that lingering doubt in the back of your mind it really left me in an uncomfortable state when all was said and done. You will feel for all the characters in one way or another and will be delighted by the chemistry of Sigourneyy and Kate Boswoth it was kooky and cute. The opening of the movie is quite impactive. We quickly see the agony of Sigourney's face before the camera cuts away to go to present time it was a well done shot. It really left me thinking after it was over which is why I'm not spoiling as much as I usually do it's a movie you need to watch for yourself.Performances. Sigourney Weaver gives an A worthy show here. Her performance is absolutely incredible at times. The anger she directs towards people the vulnerability she has and the constant fear in her eyes absolutely astonished me. She is a broken down aging woman who has lost all sense of reality for the most part. It was a moving performance that I am glad to have witnessed. Kate Bosworth is wonderful as the complexed yet strangely likable Louise who we can relate too. The unpredictability of her character often frightened me but I also felt big time for her. Alessandro Nivola is very good as Chris. He was a little cold at times but understandably so and gave a captivating show. Keri Russell is underused but very solid with what she had to do.Bottom line. The Girl in the Park is an underrated gem of a film. It hits all the right emotional notes and left me quite floored when all was said and done. It has it's flaws but for the most part this is a very good film that I recommend highly.810".

Good for a rainy day to drop into a cinema and see this you will be discussing it wyour friends for days afterward. Hope David Auburn does more movies this is his first directorial try  he did very well. Especially liked the way he handled Sigourney Weaver's personality after her daughter was kidnapped the panic attacks and inability to socialize are dead on. At the end the viewer is pretty sure of the ending but the actual facts behind it are not as important as the relationships that the characters have forged. I read a review that argued Julia should have just asked Louise to show her a birthmark but that is totally missing the point. It's a very layered very dense movie that some will immediately 'get' and others probably never will. It's not a 'chickflick' but it's a very cerebral movie.".

I think it's really about how much we all want love fulfilled how we cope with catastrophic loss how far we are willing to go to fill that empty space and how far the people who love us are willing to support us. Weaver made a wonderful transition from happy mom to a cold disconnected woman and back and forth again. Any woman with a favorite child or a personal and crippling loss can empathize  but I am astounded by the story and the performances.The young woman who suckers Weaver is offputting at first an instant irritant but by the end of the movie you really want her to love her new mom and you really want Weaver to have the daughter she never got to grow up with. It doesn't matter anymore whether she is or she isn't for reals they become what they both want. Several scenes touched me so deeply I was stunned. It would have been so easy to make this a thriller or maudlin or predictable but the director did not. It was engaging mysterious warm frightening very sad sweet and very deeply moving. The end was perfect subtle and let you absorb it all on your own. I thoroughly enjoyed every performance  they all were extremely well thought out well executed beautifully written and they all added together for a delicate and meaningful story. Do it again!

Any woman with a favorite child or a personal and crippling loss can empathize  but I am astounded by the story and the performances.The young woman who suckers Weaver is offputting at first an instant irritant but by the end of the movie you really want her to love her new mom and you really want Weaver to have the daughter she never got to grow up with. It doesn't matter anymore whether she is or she isn't for reals they become what they both want. Several scenes touched me so deeply I was stunned. It would have been so easy to make this a thriller or maudlin or predictable but the director did not. It was engaging mysterious warm frightening very sad sweet and very deeply moving. The end was perfect subtle and let you absorb it all on your own. I thoroughly enjoyed every performance  they all were extremely well thought out well executed beautifully written and they all added together for a delicate and meaningful story. Do it again! Please.";

Traumatized by the disappearance of her three year old sixteen years pass by but Julia still hasn't recovered from her loss. She has distanced herself from everyone she was once very close to and just couldn't find herself being able to connect with anyone. Until she meets young drifter Louise a girl in whom she seems to find what she has lost all those years. However this continuing encounter may have some harmful consequences.The synopsis may sound a little familiar and yet when I attempting to predict what the next turn of events would be I was thrown off with different twists and these aren't just twists that are there for the sake of surprise they fit and flow very well with the story and add more layers. Auburns use of subtlety is remarkable. Whether it's in his storytelling execution his actors performances and the overall look of the film it is handled with care and great attention to detail. Music is used effectively and the cinematography is brilliant.The writing is solid. The dialogues are simple but few words say a lot. Many argue that the subplots of the supporting characters weren't developed enough. That may be true but perhaps it adds more to Julia's story because she has shut herself away from everyone that she barely knows about them anymore. I still thought the minor characters were rich in character even though have had little screen time. None of them felt like clichs or tokens.Sigourney Weaver deserves special mention. How she can look so convincing as a 30something year old and a 50something year old is incredible. I'm not only referring to the makeup though this department certainly deserves credit but Weaver's subtle change in mannerism movement and body language really does make it look like almost twenty years have passed. This is easily one of the films that showcases her talent.Kate Bosworth does a fine job of holding her own in the presence of Weaver. The way she downplays her part of a drifter who sees a chance in Julia and wants to belong is done with sincerity. Alessandro Nivola is quite good and Keri Russell is a delight to watch even though her appearance is limited.With the lack of clichs and melodrama the director's sincerity and the film's authentic look and performances 'The Girl In The Park' is a refreshing and involving view.".

Louise tells her that she is from Michigan needs money to get home and Louise gives her 700. It all turns out to be a ruse as Julia discovers quickly but for some reason she takes Louise into her apartment gives her an extra key and tells her she can stay as long as she wants.It seems that Julia is somehow hoping this is really her longlost daughter Maggie.

While the potential was there from the beginning to weave an interesting story the story is bogged down with the characters. All the main characters were boring and morose. These were all supposed to be people with a tragedy in common. The real tragedy they had in common was that they all contributed to this film.It amazes me that some reviewers found in this film Oscar performances. Did they mean Oscar Mayer?

I'd rather visit a dentist that offers no Novocain than sit through this.The only reason to watch this through to the end is to be prepared with a pencil and paper and write down all people associated with this film and avoid further contact with their work if this is what they are dedicating their talents to. While the potential was there from the beginning to weave an interesting story the story is bogged down with the characters. All the main characters were boring and morose. These were all supposed to be people with a tragedy in common. The real tragedy they had in common was that they all contributed to this film.It amazes me that some reviewers found in this film Oscar performances. Did they mean Oscar Mayer? Definitely Baloney!";

He remains friends and close to his family. Ends up in jail and meets the love of his life. The love story between Jim Carrey and the astonishing Ewan McGregor is a first for the screen. Miles away from the wonderful Brokeback Mountain because here their love is public without borders. I totally believe in the flame that both of them ignite looking into each other's eyes. It is so intimate and real that I realized I had never seen it quite like this on the screen before. The fact that this film couldn't get a distribution is beyond me. I'm certain it's going to be one of the hits of 2009 and Jim Carrey as well as Ewan McGregor will get Oscar nominations. I saw the film on the 8th 4 days ago and I've been craving to see it again ever since. Look at McGregor's face when he realizes this man really loves him. The tenderness is nothing short of breathtaking. As if all of the above wasn't enough I Love You Phillip Morris is hysterically funny. Highly and warmly recommended.".

If so you should definitely go.The movie tells the true storyand trust me you'll have trouble believing it's trueof Steven Russell a gay man who just can't stop conning his way through life. He uses his extraordinary abilities to gain a variety of jobs gets indicted for embezzlement and wins the love of the titular Phillip Morris while the two are fellow inmates in prison.I Love You Phillip Morris was written and directed by Glen Ficarra and John Requa the same writing team responsible for Bad Santa. Like Bad Santa this movie effectively balances humor and with some very dark themes though I would say the overall tone is not nearly as bleak as that of the earlier movie.The writers told the Nashville audience that when choosing material to include from Steve McVicker's nonfiction book they decided they primarily wanted to tell the love story. They do so very successfully. You might even call this the perfect romantic comedy for people who hate traditional romantic comedies it's homo rather than heterooriented it's nonfiction and it features a somewhat offkilter con man as the romantic lead. Sounds bizarre sure and yet all these elements come together to make a really entertaining movie.For the most part Jim Carrey loses himself in the character of Steven Russell delivering an effectively nonhammy and nonCarrey comic performance. MacGregor's Phillip Morris is also believably innocent Southern and wideeyed. Nice supporting performances such as Leslie Mann's as Russell's exwife Deb round out the movie.Much of the romance takes place in prison and this creates many beautifully absurd scenes. The movie also has its fair share of sad moments and contains a pretty clear message about social justice in Texas  as did the book but this is kept mercifully subtle underlying rather than overshadowing the story.The directors said they hoped the movie would make spectators laugh cry and think and the Nashville audience seemed to do all three. There were a lot of laughs but some definite sniffles at the appropriate moments. At the QA there was a fair amount of interest in the real story and Ficarra McVicker and Requa were happy to oblige with further information.Come to think of it you may not have to worry about seeing the two leads have sex. Although the love scenes were kept technically PG the directors were expecting a fight with the MPAA because of the homosexual content. That's a real pity but I hope they win.".

Ewan McGregor is equally astonishing as Phillip Morris  you'd swear you were watching the kind of unique romantic chemistry between two actors that arrives very rarely in cinema and virtually never between two Alisters playing gay lovers but the love story is only a foundation for what emerges as a kinetic superbly told comedydrama about the real life exploits of con man and recidivist prison escapee Steven Jay Russell.Directorswriters Glenn Ficarra and John Requa expertly handle the tensions of comic and dramatic performance and also prove to have a masterly touch with the frenzied action sequences. Bit parts are cast beautifully. You can see the attention to detail and craft in this movie.It can only be assumed that the gay context of this film has cost it it's commercial potential in the eyes of distributors because everything else about it spells box office success. Apparently it will finally have a limited release in the US in October this year with the potential of expansion.Without spoiling any of the twists of the film's detailed series of events the film succeeds at beautifully hijacking audience expectation time and again. Just when you think you've got the film pinned for being predictable suddenly it flips on you with a wry smile as if to say I knew what you were thinking.I'm not sure how close the producers stuck to the facts but it scarcely matters.

Open your mind and you will see that it is an amazing story about an amazing man told in the most funny and sincere manner. I mean wow! If I would have a hat I would take it off to honor these people who have been brave enough and daring enough to take up this story and created such an excellent movie. It is a some what sensitive topic. Well yeh but in the movie it is merely a background against which all the action takes place.I believe that the world has grown and its views on homosexuality are not as strict as they used to be some years ago. I hope that people are not going to be hypocrites and by saying that the subject of mentomen love is not acceptable to them ignore this movie.The movie is about a man named Steven Russell  a man who has never figured out who he really is and what is his place in this world. He has seen it all and done it all but everything has been merely a preamble to what's coming. He meets his true love. He meets Phillip Morris. From then on he lives for this man. All he does is for the soul purpose of making his other half happy and that is what gets him into trouble. It happens just because there are no limits to what he would do for the man he loves. Also his imagination and creativity is endless. There are not as many people who would do the same for those who we love.Though it is very funny featuring fresh humor which is based more in the situations than actual jokes and funny oneliners it is just as sad. It is even tragic. I guess that is the way with life after flying high there comes a low fall. Since the movie is based on actual events there is no alternative ending. But I want to say let's not get sad! Let's look at this movie as a celebration of life and love. It is a wonderful but in the end heartbreaking love story.To conclude I want to point out the outstanding performance of the two main actors  Ewan McGregor and Jim Carrey. I don't have a large enough vocabulary to describe how much I enjoyed it. For Carrey it is not a typical part but he does wonders with it. I wish we would see him more often in movies like this I mean smart and deep. His comedy experience brings new quality to the drama genre. However he is a first rate actor who makes us laugh and cry and that is why we love him no matter what movie he is in. McGregor is equally good. The fact is they both make us believe when we watch the movie and that is the testimony of how great they really are.".

Strange I thought because some people I know had RSVP'd much later than me and they were included in the screening. Why? Because I was born in 1940 and the other were people in their 30's. One of them took me has his guest and surprise surprise I was the one who loved the movie and has become since then a promoter of the film so much so that people call me me! to ask me Do you know when it will be released? I have to tell the marketing experts that they got the age thing completely wrong and discrimination of this kind doesn't serve the film very well at all. Now that out of the way let me talk about this extraordinary film. A true story no less. A conman searching for love and a romance like no other. Jim Carrey is superb and I bet that if producers and distributors resolve their nonsense he'll be a strong contender at the Oscars 2011. He injects his character with the kind of truth I hadn't seen before in a Jim Carrey performance. Much more than in Man On The Moon or The Truman Show The character allows him to be the great funny man that he is and at the same time there are layers and layers of new inedited brilliance. And if that wasn't enough Ewan McGregor! A masterful portrayal of someone finding love in the most unexpected man in the most unexpected place. The scene of them falling in love has become one of my favorites. Now you marketing people will you let me in next time?".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those films that you will never forget seeing and for a number of reasons. Firstly the story true or not is engaging funny and contains some great characters. It allows for Carrey to excel at what he does best which is to experiment with his own character. While somewhat unbelievable the story is like it or not engaging and it holds one's interest. Carrey plays a shall we say actively gay man with good humour without being too vulgar although the vivid noholdsbarred buggery scenes may be a little too much for some viewers! They had me cringing but Carrey manages to make it funny and light hearted.It is a film relatively light on the kind of laughoutloud humour that we're used to seeing from Carrey but the more films I see him in the more I respect him as a genuinely well rounded comic actor. He has matured well over the years but his childish mischievous tendencies never truly left him and it is shown wonderfully in this movie really taking the content to the next level without overpowering the consistently engaging storyline.As for Ewan McGregor the effort that he clearly put into this role more than paid off and he was utterly convincing and a perfect support for Carrey. These two seemed like the most unlikely pairing for any film let alone one of this nature which is precisely why I just had to see it! This movie is a must see for all who like a good laugh and appreciate when a film tugs and throws you around emotionally from laughing hysterically to feeling genuinely glum and back again. The way the film perfectly captures tragedy heartbreak loss and pain is immersing. I found myself feeling privileged to have witnessed a good solid piece of film making that had me laughing but ended so eloquently and respectfully. Then BAM! Carrey comes right back and the plot totally doubles back on itself! Fantastic stuff...This film left me sat in my cinema seat with a big grin on my face just desperate for it to be released on DVD. It will go down as a cult favourite in comedy filmmaking. It's got everything love loss hilarity a fantastic script wonderful characters fine acting cons swindles betrayals you name it! Well worth a watch if you want to see a new genuinely fabulous film that doesn't cost about 15 to watch and isn't some overhyped blockbuster all just because it's in 3D...Oh by the way if you're a homophobe don't bother watching this.

A master of reading people gaining trust and manipulating many systems Russell was proved to have stolen from a major food service corporation and a major healthcare organization. Stolen as in hundreds of thousands of dollars. The smaller cons are too numerous to count. And don't forget his string of jailprison escapes! Glenn Ficarra and John Regua the writing team behind Bad Santa codirect this story based on Steve McVicer's book on Russell. Somehow they have delivered a hokey boring film despite the man at the center of the story. Luckily for them Jim Carrey drums up a terrific performance as Russell and provides relief from the amateurish script and direction.The role of Phillip Morris is tackled by Ewan McGregor in a manner we have not previously seen from him. His effeminate naivety offers a nice contrast to the domineering RussellCarrey. The support work is minimal but provided by the very capable Rodrigo Santoro and the very talented but totally wasted here Leslie Mann.The film gives us the beginning of the fall for Russell. His parents tell him he was adopted and he responds by tracking down his birth mother. He pretty much falls apart after that meeting and commences with his endless stream of cons. Is he a happily married man or is he gay? Is he a brilliant strategist or an embezzler? His life changes during one of his trips to jail. He meets Phillip Morris. Their life together is full of excess thanks to Russell's latest scam. As always the con is exposed and Russell spends his entire life alternating between being on the lam or in jail.I found the film inferior to Catch Me if You Can a better not great film about another real life con man Frank Abignale. The cat and mouse chases of that film held my interest. This film has little drama despite the obvious talents of this offcenter man. My guess is that in the hands of better filmmakers this could have been a much improved film.Apparently Russell's biggest con was played on himself. He never really figured out who he is. He is now serving a life sentence in nearsolitary confinement in prison. Mr. McVicker the book's author has stated two very telling observations. First he suspects Phillip Morris was not quite as innocent as he would have us believe. Second his description of Russell as a man who makes you want to believe tells you all you need know about this ultimate con man.".

This is definitely a detour for Carrey whom is mostly known for doing commercial fare. It is refreshing to see big stars indulge in what would usually be performed by actors without the A grade stature. What really impressed me were the very explicit and heavy sex scenes and romantic moments between Mac Gregor and Carrey. They felt real and tender. I know this film was going to cause waves because even though I watch independents all the time I as surprise to see two A list actors go at it sexually the way both these actors do in Phillip Morris. I hope this film is taken as an example for other A listers to follow in creating other really original and daring works. Specially applaud Europa Luc Besson's film company for putting together such and abrasive and risky subject matter.".

	schema:reviewBody "When straight guys play gay guys this can go either pretty well or pretty badly this film being a prime example of the latter. If it goes well you'll usually have actors who play their gay characters as in any other not necessarily tragic romantic involvement which is what Gyllenhaal and Ledger did in 'Brokeback' and what Colin Firth did in 'A Single Man'. If it goes badly the actors andor the script rely heavily on common gay stereotypes which is what Patrick Swayze did in 'To Wong Fu' and what Jim Carrey does here. That's all the more regrettable as the true Steven Russell story is indeed brilliant screen material among other things dwelling on the reasons why family fathers at a turning point of their lives may question their sexual identity. What do the script and the abominable showman Carrey make out of this? He exclaims 'I wanna be a faggot! outlined on a stretcher after a car accident. His character quickly evolves into one of the most offensive Hollywood portrayals of gay men I've ever seen while the extravagant shallow conman lifestyle Russell aka Carrey pursues in the film may be accurate for the story I could have done very well without clich remarks such as 'I discovered that being gay is terribly expensive'. This plays well into a certain public stance towards gays we tolerate you as long as you behave according to our stereotypes which films like this embrace. Typical for this are the ridiculously overplayed sex scenes which seem to have caused a stir even though there's a straight sex scene just as ridiculous to match which should have shown that credibility isn't quite the issue here.To be fair it's not all Carrey's fault the script jumps from one perspective to the other and simply can't decide what this is supposed to turn into. A gay romance? A conman story? A comedy? A dramedy? A biopic? McEwan seems just as confused about this as his hapless character even though he is about the only good thing this drivel has to offer his acting angle appears to be just as clueless as the viewer in regard to the plot.Or maybe I'm just being a drama queen and Carrey's shenanigans are just the harmless silly fun they've always been. Yet it's hard to be objective about a film that mocks a significant part of your life.".

That part is solidly untrue. He's turned from his goofy form multiple times The Truman Show The Number 23 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Majestic etc etc. I guess they're referring to he's now SHOCK in 2010! playing a gay male oh no!Big deal. But what is a big deal is if these were true characters Carrey did NOT break away from his typical brand of slapstick. So I'm lead to believe either the true Steven Russell played by Carrey is just like Jim Carrey or Jim Carrey put little effort into conforming to the true Russell. Either way I doubt I will or hope not to see any award nominations this time around.Furthermore McGregor is no stranger to playing gay or out of character. But his character Phillip Morris is just as annoying to watch on screen as Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Capote. Please note I think Hoffman did a fantastic job at portraying Capote but that didn't help me like the flamboyant characterreal life subject anymore.Russell is a former Christian and family man turned liar and a conartist who literally can get away with anything everything while fooling just about anyone a la gayFrank Abagnale Jr. from Catch Me if You Can  a thoroughly more enjoyable film. Granted both this movie and the Leonardo DiCaprio film take place way in the past where I suppose check kiting and credit card fraud was a bit lot easier I still have a hard time believing Russell got away with a tenth of the scenariosdisguises. Perhaps if it did happen as they say then it falls on the fault of Carrey's believability.Nevertheless you simply have to believe he can become who he wants working his way to the top of any firm and fool former prison inmate Morris into loving him. There's a little background on that prison time and more on Russell's growing up.Deep southern and deeper flamboyant Morris will simply believe anything Russell says and does or he's just blinded by love. And as the inevitable downward spiral web of lies Russell falls into he does show a hint of true love for Russell. Yep I get the title of the film and 83 times he says it in the film but you do have to look deeper than the words of the world's gayest liar.This movie took a VERY long time coming to the U.S. Long story look it up and was it worth the wait? Yes and no. I wouldn't completely dismiss it but it is very weird. And I'm not referring to the gay scenes. Been there done that. It's just an abstract movie pretending to be and arthouse classic.".

To be fair the entire tone of I Love You Phillip Morris is about as glib as Carrey's performance giving this supposedly true story about one con man's neverending crusade to avoid the law and be with his one true love played by Ewan McGregor the quality of a tall tale pulling our leg. All well and good but then what are we supposed to do with scenes showing Carrey's onetime lover dying of AIDS or the tender moments between Carrey and McGregor scenes that could have been somewhat groundbreaking in their own way how often do two straight actors play homosexuals having tender moments if they weren't treated like a joke. Carrey's uncontrolled comic performance almost dares us to care about anything we're watching. Well guess what?......we don't.This film should have taken its cue from Catch Me If You Can another movie about a con artist and spent more of its time on the details behind the cons themselves.

	schema:reviewBody "Coming as it does from the two guys who wrote Bad Santa Glenn Ficarra and John Requa that most misanthropic of Christmas movies I had high or should I say low expectations of I love you Phillip Morris touted as a kind of 'gay romcom' and based on a true story. At the beginning we are told that 'this really happened' and then as if to counter any misgivings we might be having 'it really did' since the story that unfolds is one you could hardly make up truth it seems really is stranger than fiction.Hollywood of course is not known for handling gay subjects with any degree of sensitivity and when they do they results are often pofaced at best. Of course sensitivity is hardly what one expects from these guys  grossout might be nearer the mark. The pleasant surprise of I love you Phillip Morris is that it succeeds in being tasteless or rather happily unpc and touching almost simultaneously. It is also very very funny.The central character isn't the titular Phillip but the guy who says 'I love you'. Steven Russell is gay and a conman and having 'come out' as the former if not the latter he concludes that the kind of gay lifestyle he has grown accustomed to is very expensive. Until he is caught he seemed to me to be a very successful conman but not successful enough and he ends up in prison where he meets and falls in love with very quickly and not so much across a crowded room as across an empty prison library said Phillip Morris. His love for Phillip seems irrational and allencompassing and when he is released he uses his powers of conman ship to get Phillip released too. After that his life is dedicated to earning or rather conning his employers out of enough money to keep Phillip happy. Or is it? I got the distinct impression that Steven became so caught up in his own deceptions he almost forgot Phillip existed. Finally he is caught and imprisoned again and the rest of their lives are spent in and out of various jails.It's a touching tale a love story where the love is definitely palpable that it's between two guys is totally irrelevant. The 'issue' of their sexuality is not an issue at all. Steven's gayness and his coming out is dispensed with in one or two good jokes and that's it Q.E.D. Once established it ceases to be a problem if ever it was a problem to start with and the last thing I love you Phillip Morris is is a problem picture. If on the other hand you find the sight of two men kissing or the idea of having anal and oral sex less explicit than it could have been or if you find gay stereotyping and jokes about AIDS too near the knuckle then I love you Phillip Morris is not for you. However should you have an unhealthy sense of humour and an openmind you are likely to have a ball.Substantial performances from Jim Carrey as Steven and Ewan McGregor his best part and best performance in years as Phillip go a long way to boost the film's credibility not to mention its likability. Not that Steven is a particularly likable guy. Actually if he moved in next door to me I think I would move house. At one point Steven's exwife yes he's also gone down the heterosexual road as well asks if the stealing and 'the gay thing' could be linked and while Steven would be the first to tell you he steals in order to keep up his gay lifestyle his 'problems' are never explained or even explored in terms of his sexuality. His sexuality the movie is telling us is integral to his nature and has been since childhood. His hyperactive imagination and overthetop personality are something else again. Gay or straight Steven isn't someone I would want to know. Phillip on the other hand is sweetness personified and the voice of reason in Steven's world. Unfortunately it's a voice Steven doesn't seem to hear.I laughed out loud several times during this film though I did find the ending genuinely sad. There can be no happy ending for Steven and Phillip since Steven never sees the error of his ways. His life may be exotic and dangerous and may make for a great movie but in reality it is sad and really rather pathetic. Steven's stealing is a form of psychosis from which he is never cured and in the end it is his downfall. For the length of this smart and funny film his loss is our gain.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was sold to me as a comedy and if I could think of a single laugh I had then I would give it a higher rating. There is an interesting story to be had here particularly its being based on the true story of one Steven Russell Jim Carrey. Russell was an ultimate con man and jailbreaker but this presentation is so erratic and exaggerated that it fell flat for me.Russell winds up in prison where he meets the eponymous Philip Morris Ewan McGregor his true love. Carrey and McGregor have about as much chemistry between them as any two straight guys pretending to be gay would have. I have rarely been more conscious of actors straining to act a part. How McGregor got involved in this nonsense is beyond me.With regard to its failure as a comedy consider just one scene the scene where Carrey is being chased and jumps off the ledge of a building. He first throws his shoes over and we see that they land softly on some bags in a dumpster. Then Carrey jumps and we see that he has missed the dumpster entirely and is on the ground bleeding. It's supposed to be funny that we think Carrey is so stupid as to jump away from the dumpster and that we think he is dead? But not only is he not dead the story continues as if nothing had happened.The depictions of how Steven Russell pulled off his cons are so simple that as presented they could not have worked in reality. There is an idea that one can get by in a profession by simply pretending without any preparation. The real Russell was surely cleverer than what is shown here. Can you win a legal case by calling the judge into his chambers and remaining silent until the judge volunteers winning case law to you? In fact it would be interesting to know just how the real Russell did accomplish his astonishing feats.I did not find the the frequent references to homosexual practices e.g. you can either pay for that or perform oral sex particularly funny. A potential audience should be warned that there are some explicit scenes that many will find disgusting like the anal intercourse scene. Will anyone find that amusing?The tone is all over the map. Most scenes are played for comedy but then you have a scene like the one that has Carrey at the bedside of a partner who is in the final moments of his dying of AIDS. That scene is played for drama and if you think that Carrey has the chops to pull that off then you have a higher ability to suspend disbelief than I.This thing was a total loss for me.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must start with a personal statement  I'm amazed at the silliness of those who bombastically declare this to be the worst movie of all times and so on... Really? Is it really that bad worse than Manos  The Hands of Fate or Cocoon  the Return? I think most of the people who diss this film fall broadly in three large categories 1 those who are so attached to the original short story that they can't stand the idea of an eponymous film with a different vision although again its Gibson himself who penned this script! This is not purism but acting like brats  just like those who criticized the film Resident Evil for not sticking closer to the original games. 2 then there are those who have a personal dislike for Keanu Reeves and they follow him over the 'net criticizing him for wooden acting. It doesn't matter to them that the Johnny character is exactly what Keanu portrays  an egotistic selfabsorbed bastard who only cares about his posh clothes cold Mexican beer and hookers and there are already so many out there like him in the real world!. Then 3 there are those who are simply too stupid to actually watch what's going on on the screen because of personal convictions education or background i.e. those who mention Grenpeace and anticapitalism as if they are capital crimes or those who think PharmaKom is a Japanese company. I was particularly amused at the user who launched a furious diatribe against the idea of the LoTeks being so visible in the ruined bridge despite the fact that the only time in which they actually identify themselves as the source of antiestablishment activities is the very end when they also announce they'll be going off the air. The list could go on. But this is supposed to be a review not an answer to those who dislike the movie so vehemently.I believe this is the film which despite its occasional artistic shortcomings connects Blade Runner to The Matrix. It was a courageous endeavour portraying an alltoo possible near future and reminded me of another picture similarly vilified by simpletons who couldn't see beyond the surface  Starship Troopers. The sad fact is that the movie was mistreated and what we ended by seeing on DVD in most of the world is not what the director intended. There is an alternative version briefly mentioned on this site which makes some significant changes and it's available only in Japan. First of all the prologue is different and more poignant. Here it is in this exact formNew century. Age of terminal capitalism.The armored towers of multinational corporations rise above the ruins of the democracies that gave them birth.Soldiers of the Yakuza defend them.Hackers datapirates LoTek media rebels are the enemy burrowing like rats in the walls of cyberspace.A new plague convulses the cities Nerve Attenuation Syndrome incurable fatal epidemic bringing fear and misery as old as the species itself.But the most precious data is sometimes entrusted to elite private agents wetwired to function as human data banks.Mnemonic couriers.In this day and age in the postEnron post911 world all the above doesn't seem so farfetched anymore.The film is more somber in the Japanese version. We see more of Takahashi's inner desolation and there are some added bits of gore and violence in the Beijing fight. Johnny himself is much more of a corporate puppet  we see it from a longer dialogue with the hooker in the hotel room or in the scene in which he acquires the memory doubler. We see JBone sticking a syringe in the dolphin sadistically commenting how the creature is a junkie.There is also more realism involved Spoiler alert! the hero doesn't somehow miraculously recover his childhood memories after being connected to Jones. And we see how Johnny exhausted decides to get it over with despite a dire warning that the looping procedure through the dolphin will most certainly kill him. That is a moment of pure redemption sadly lost in the official European and NorthAmerican film versions.Last but not least the extended cut gives more screen time to Lundgren's mad preacher character. We see him sermonizing in his church in front of a rapt audience using words and gestures that are scarily familiar to anyone who has watched an Evangelical TV channel. He discovers along the way that Johnny's load is the miraculous cure for NAS and he covets it for himself  he even shouts he wants to become like God. It's easy to see why some circles decided to eliminate all this potentially uncomfortable content... but we ended up with a caricature instead of a cunning and shrewd film villain.Johnny we barely knew you.".

It doesn't matter to them that the Johnny character is exactly what Keanu portrays  an egotistic selfabsorbed bastard who only cares about his posh clothes cold Mexican beer and hookers and there are already so many out there like him in the real world!. Then 3 there are those who are simply too stupid to actually watch what's going on on the screen because of personal convictions education or background i.e. those who mention Grenpeace and anticapitalism as if they are capital crimes or those who think PharmaKom is a Japanese company. I was particularly amused at the user who launched a furious diatribe against the idea of the LoTeks being so visible in the ruined bridge despite the fact that the only time in which they actually identify themselves as the source of antiestablishment activities is the very end when they also announce they'll be going off the air. The list could go on. But this is supposed to be a review not an answer to those who dislike the movie so vehemently.I believe this is the film which despite its occasional artistic shortcomings connects Blade Runner to The Matrix. It was a courageous endeavour portraying an alltoo possible near future and reminded me of another picture similarly vilified by simpletons who couldn't see beyond the surface  Starship Troopers. The sad fact is that the movie was mistreated and what we ended by seeing on DVD in most of the world is not what the director intended. There is an alternative version briefly mentioned on this site which makes some significant changes and it's available only in Japan. First of all the prologue is different and more poignant. Here it is in this exact formNew century. Age of terminal capitalism.The armored towers of multinational corporations rise above the ruins of the democracies that gave them birth.Soldiers of the Yakuza defend them.Hackers datapirates LoTek media rebels are the enemy burrowing like rats in the walls of cyberspace.A new plague convulses the cities Nerve Attenuation Syndrome incurable fatal epidemic bringing fear and misery as old as the species itself.But the most precious data is sometimes entrusted to elite private agents wetwired to function as human data banks.Mnemonic couriers.In this day and age in the postEnron post911 world all the above doesn't seem so farfetched anymore.The film is more somber in the Japanese version. We see more of Takahashi's inner desolation and there are some added bits of gore and violence in the Beijing fight. Johnny himself is much more of a corporate puppet  we see it from a longer dialogue with the hooker in the hotel room or in the scene in which he acquires the memory doubler. We see JBone sticking a syringe in the dolphin sadistically commenting how the creature is a junkie.There is also more realism involved Spoiler alert! the hero doesn't somehow miraculously recover his childhood memories after being connected to Jones. And we see how Johnny exhausted decides to get it over with despite a dire warning that the looping procedure through the dolphin will most certainly kill him. That is a moment of pure redemption sadly lost in the official European and NorthAmerican film versions.Last but not least the extended cut gives more screen time to Lundgren's mad preacher character. We see him sermonizing in his church in front of a rapt audience using words and gestures that are scarily familiar to anyone who has watched an Evangelical TV channel. He discovers along the way that Johnny's load is the miraculous cure for NAS and he covets it for himself  he even shouts he wants to become like God. It's easy to see why some circles decided to eliminate all this potentially uncomfortable content... but we ended up with a caricature instead of a cunning and shrewd film villain.Johnny we barely knew you.";

	schema:headline " Several Gibson concepts thrown together";
	schema:reviewBody "Johnny Mnemonic could have been a wonderful movie had William Gibson not strayed so far from his original story when writing the screenplay.  Having painter Robert Longo direct the movie the first and to this date only full length feature he has directed was probably not the best idea either. While Longo may present the occasional intriguing image his inexperience shows in other areas.  The acting is terrible for the most part with Henry Rollins taking the cake for worst performance.  Reeves contrary to popular opinion is alright and has a few great scenes most notably his angry breakdown on the pile of garbage under the bridge.Having read Johnny Mnemonic several times the character of Jane is one of the most annoying factors of the movie.  In the story the character is Molly Millions a confident tough as nails mercenary who sports several augmentations most important being retractable blades under her fingernails.  However they had to change the character since Molly Millions is also a main character in Gibson's book Neuromancer and another company owed the film production rights for that book including the character of Molly.  But they could have made Jane more like Molly. Instead she's as insecure as Johnny and he spends more time protecting her than she does him which is supposed to be her job.There are other little inaccuracies in the movie such as the Magnetic Dog Sisters.  In the story they are the door guards at the club and Johnny claims that they are bad news in a tussle.  In the movie they are Ralfi's bodyguards and portrayed as pathetic and outdated rather than dangerous. The story doesn't have anything about NAS that's all a fabrication to fill space for the movie.   Gibson seems to try to shoehorn several of his concepts into the Johnny Mnemonic movie.  Instead of living in the rafters high above the streets as they do in the story the Lo Teks live on an old bridge.  Gibson has people living on the Golden Gate Bridge in his books Virtual Light and All Tomorrow's Parties.  The bartender Hooky  at the club where Johnny meets Ralfi is an approximation of Ratz a bartender from the book Neuromancer. Johnny never accesses the matrix the internet in the story but he does in the movie for no apparent reason other than allowing director Longo to show off some CGI special effects.Longo also chooses to mimic Blade Runner in the opening scenes and later on one character tells another that it's time to die a famous line from BR. I thought this was unnecessary and cheapens the movie as blatantly ripping of Blade Runner whether it's for the purpose of homage or not is the signature of several BMovies which is sadly what Johnny Mnemonic ends up being anyway.I still like the movie.  It does have some good elements to it and if you're a fan of Gibson you should see it.  It's better than Abel Ferrera's terrible adaptation of New Rose Hotel because it at least portrays Gibsons technological world.  I hope that Johnny Mnemonic is remade one day because it is a great story. I'd ask Reeves to play Johnny again because I like him in the role. Gibson's writing is so descriptive that a screenplay should follow the story as literally as possible.  Ideally I think that Johnny Mnemonic would work out as a short film something no longer than an hour. It is a short story after all and adding filler to extend the time certainly didn't work the first time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw half of this movie on television once and since I am a avid scifi fan the story intrigued me. A couple of weeks later I went out to pick up a copy of this movie for myself and ever since I've been watching it every now and then. Not every month but at least once every 4 or 5 months. Sometimes more. There's just something about it that I like. Well lets start from the beginningIt is the year 2021 and the world has been taken over by large coorporations that do pretty much what they want to. Most of them are out to make money however and will do anything to achieve that goal. One of these coorporations is PharmaCom a coorporation that deals in medicine and exists pretty much all over the world. From Beijing to Newark. 'Johnny' is a Mnemonic courier who carries an implant in his brain which allows him to carry a large amount of data there. But when he accepts a job where he is overloaded with data he is not only experiencing trouble with getting rid of the data but also finds that several bounty hunters and crime organizations are after his head and the information stored within. Over 24 hours he jumps around in the city of Newark trying to find a way to get rid of the data and the bounty hunters.A touch in this movie that many might recognize from the film 'The Matrix' is that in this movie they tend to hook themselves up to the internet which has become a virtual reality like l The Lawnmower man. But in the end of the film Keanu's character completly hooks himself up to the internet for a short amount of time walking around in it and controlling his actions as if he was in another world. Pretty much like he did in the Matrix. Wierd huh?The film presents a very interesting vision of the future. Coorporations crime syndicates virtualreality futuristic weapons and the like. The sets look authentic and the look and feel of the film is topnotch. The music seems to fit the mood at all times too which is a big plus. The characters are likeable and unique in their own way but with one exception. Keanu Reeves plays 'Johnny' without any life or energy put into it and delivers his lines flat and in the most boring way. His worst acting job ever? Perhaps. You could tell he didn't like this movie very much.Overall its a very interesting scifi flick which has its ups and downs. The upsides is the setting the music the vision of the future etc. etc. while the downsides are Keanu Reeve's acting and sometimes lack of interest in what happens next in the movie. I give it a 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "My review of the underrated cyberpunk film Johnny Mnemonic1995 starring Keanu Reeves Dina Meyer IceT Takeshi Kitano Denis Akiyama Dolph Lundgren Henry Rollins Barbara Sukowa and Udo Kier. Johnny Mnemonic is a 1995 American cyberpunk scifi action film directed by Robert Longo. It was loosely based on the short story Johnny Mnemonic by William Gibson.Keanu Reeves plays the title character a man with a cybernetic brain implant designed to store information. The film portrays Gibson's dystopia view of the future with the world dominated by mega corporations and with strong East Asian influences. Seriously this movie kicks ass. Keanu Reeves and Dina Meyer are awesome. I love when An assassin try's to kill Johnny he aim his gun on his back and says Time to die and Johnny says Time and he switch's his watch and the bomb explodes. Dina Meyer as body guard Jane throws a grenade and kills a few assassins. Dina Meyer also co started in her latest movie in the 90's Starship Troopers unfortunately her character in that movie was killed. I really love Dolph Lundgren as Street Preacher It's Jesus time! HALT SINNERS! Dolph shows up after next 45.mins. in the movie I wish he would have showed earlier. He's acting is still pretty good. IceT and Udo Kier did a great performance in their roles. This movie is very underrated an solid Action flick I wish there would be more Action flick like are this today. In my opinion The Matrix and Johnny Mnemonic are my top 2 best Action Scifi flicks from Keanu Reeves of the 90's. Movies like are this don't exist today anymore. The film was shot on location in Canada with Toronto and Montreal filling in for the film's Newark New Jersey and Beijing settings. A number of local monuments including Toronto's Union Station and Montreal's skyline and Jacques Cartier Bridge feature prominently.The film premiered in Japan first on April 15 1995 with a longer version 103 Min's that is closer to the director's cut and features a previously composed score by Mychael Danna different editing and more scenes with Japanese star Takeshi Kitano and Dolph Lundgren notably. Val Kilmer was originally set to star but left the project after he was offered the role of Batman in Batman Forever.The character Molly Millions from the original story was changed to Jane for the film. They are very similar characters except that Molly had retractable razor blades under her fingernails and augmented vision. It is believed that the change was due to the Molly character being attached to the rights for any possible future Neuromancer film adaptation.The script was rumored to have been dumped on the doorstep of Keanu Reeves' house a tactic that piqued his interest and led to him accepting the role of Johnny.B.J. Rack one of the producers is still credited although he left the project due to creative differences with director Robert Longo First of all the prologue is different and more poignant. Here it is in this exact formNew century. Age of terminal capitalism.The armored towers of multinational corporations rise above the ruins of the democracies that gave them birth.Soldiers of the Yakuza defend them.Hackers datapirates LoTek media rebels are the enemy burrowing like rats in the walls of cyberspace.A new plague convulses the cities Nerve Attenuation Syndrome incurable fatal epidemic bringing fear and misery as old as the species itself.But the most precious data is sometimes entrusted to elite private agents wet wired to function as human data banks.Mnemonic couriers.1010".

A number of local monuments including Toronto's Union Station and Montreal's skyline and Jacques Cartier Bridge feature prominently.The film premiered in Japan first on April 15 1995 with a longer version 103 Min's that is closer to the director's cut and features a previously composed score by Mychael Danna different editing and more scenes with Japanese star Takeshi Kitano and Dolph Lundgren notably. Val Kilmer was originally set to star but left the project after he was offered the role of Batman in Batman Forever.The character Molly Millions from the original story was changed to Jane for the film. They are very similar characters except that Molly had retractable razor blades under her fingernails and augmented vision. It is believed that the change was due to the Molly character being attached to the rights for any possible future Neuromancer film adaptation.The script was rumored to have been dumped on the doorstep of Keanu Reeves' house a tactic that piqued his interest and led to him accepting the role of Johnny.B.J. Rack one of the producers is still credited although he left the project due to creative differences with director Robert Longo First of all the prologue is different and more poignant. Here it is in this exact formNew century. Age of terminal capitalism.The armored towers of multinational corporations rise above the ruins of the democracies that gave them birth.Soldiers of the Yakuza defend them.Hackers datapirates LoTek media rebels are the enemy burrowing like rats in the walls of cyberspace.A new plague convulses the cities Nerve Attenuation Syndrome incurable fatal epidemic bringing fear and misery as old as the species itself.But the most precious data is sometimes entrusted to elite private agents wet wired to function as human data banks.Mnemonic couriers.1010";

Whereas the new ones like Spider and the Street Preacher are much more entertaining. For example One of the central ideas in the short story was that Johnny is a very technical boy  totally reliant on technology  and therefore actually needs Molly's musclepower to protect him. Aside from one initial rescue Johnny actually saves his own bodyguard more times than she helps him with anything! Maybe Keanu has a Heroism Clause of his own like Kevin Kostner...  A pleasant surprise though was the appearance of Takeshi Kitano even if it was a small part.My favourite scene is Johnnys rant on the rubbish heap. I know it is contrary to the intent of the scene but I sympathise completely with his feelings. He had sacrificed something that most people hold sacred in order to live a certain lifestyle and it gets taken away from him completely undeservedly  no wonder he feels cheated.If you really want Gibsonesque cyberpunk go for New Rose Hotel 1998  instead.".

We all agree on this. It also has horrible and too long and boring computer animations of what goes on inside the Internet and an arguably ridiculous plot where the hero must upload twice his capacity into his brain in order to afford to get his childhood memories back.

If you thought Hackers was a pile of poop with all its cyberspace mumbo jumbo you're in for a real feast here.First of all Keanu can't act. He's quite possibly the worst popular actor of our time. We all agree on this. It also has horrible and too long and boring computer animations of what goes on inside the Internet and an arguably ridiculous plot where the hero must upload twice his capacity into his brain in order to afford to get his childhood memories back. Wow!I might've rated this movie a 0 if it was possible but a scene including a dead guy near the end made me smile earning it a single point from me!110";

Basically they convincingly turned Toronto's fabled Union Station into some postapocalyptic hospice in which we were all supposed to be shuffling around getting food and suffering from some neurological disease.  It's always amusing to see what filmmakers do to disguise Toronto as something else to make it look like it takes place anywhere else other than gasp Canada.  Still whenever I go to Union Station I am impressed with the makeover this location got. I was anxious to see whether I made in the final cut or not but the film's release kept on getting pushed back and pushed back.  That is a sure sign that the movie is going to be a turkey.  Well it isn't terrible.  William Gibson expanded his own short story so much so that the film is actually a mess.  A beautiful looking one however.  Longo and DOP Francois Protat do a serviceable job in capturing the plastic noir of the future.  But ultimately the movie suffers from having too many ideas some of them ludicrous many of them poorly developed.  It doesn't help either that the drama of the piece relies on the thespian abilities of Keanu Reeves or Dolph Lundgren.  Yikes!  Even so Henry Rollins is pretty cool.But for me the great suspense was seeing whether or not I ended up on the cutting room floor.  So for about two seconds you get to see my face in a crowd shot.  See? See? Wait! Damn!".

The differences will probably annoy Gibsons fans. The biggest problem is that the movie feels like a bunch of ideas thrown together with no real connection. This is a movie with Yakuza killers  fanatic priest  a data decoding dolphin some girl's soul stuck in a corporate computer system and laser whips. Some of them are cool and work  but most of them don't work at all. The story doesn't really tell anything deep or interesting about the future world.The movie is badly directed by Robert Longo who isn't a professional director  but a painter !. Keanu Reeves can't act and the other actors including raper IceT are on his level of bad acting. There is one surprisingly good performance here  Dolph Lundgren who plays fanatic priest. He's a colorful  funny and memorable character  even if he feels out of place here.There are some cool CGI special effects sowing what is going inside in the Internet  even if they feel pointless. The action elements are weak .I give it 210. Better watch Strange days instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "I like this film. The ending was lame but most are in my opinion. I like SciFi movies from the rubber suited aliens to the control lights flashing madly for no apparent reason except for effect. Let's face it in any given year there are few SciFi movies made. Look at the long lists of movies made and there might be a SciFi movie amongst them. Horror does far better with at least three or four a year. SciFi has been a subjective genre and will probably remain so. After all the futurepresent seems so dull mundane and exploited when you're living in it planes cars tanks computers internet.Specifically about this movie I like the stark opening on the Main Character. He desperately angrily wants the money to get his memories back and do it right. The perfect setup for the risk he decides to take. The exposition dialogue on this point could be  better but it got the point across again and again what was at stake and why. He was so desperate that he was willing to risk his life to obtain HIS goal.Then we have the usual introduction of characters and the running fighting and hiding.  Each step of the way he is always closer to getting that thing out of his head and renewing his childhood memories.I agree with the other comments regarding the Main Character's desires whil e standing on a garbage heap and his life looks like garbage  he will never live to enjoy his childhood again nor the physical comforts he thinks he wants.The lotechs vs.  the corporate is an old theme with maybe another angle. It sets the backdrop for the overall story the good and the bad fighting for control. The corporate side I liked. The lotech side was the usual nothing new.What I liked about the corporate side was the ancient use of the godlike conscience represented by the woman in the computer. The one who nags the corporate head to help the lotechs for his absolution in the memory of his dead daughter.The godlike conscience character is rarely used in American drama but heavily honored by Asians. I have always liked this dramatic element even when demonstrated in the classical Greek. How can we define good and evil when it is beyond our control and understanding? Thus is an Asian view as well as the ancient world of the meaning of life. The doll white face and the near obliteration of any human features just as in the face masks worn in the ancient Greek dramas or in the ancient art of Kabuki.Like I said I like all SciFi. It is too rare. As I illustrated above there were plenty of good dramatic elements and shots to make the movie enjoyable. Even the lame stuff has its own entertainment just as good as rubber suited aliens.".

Once in Newark he learns that his employer has doublecrossed him he is forced to go on the run with cybernetically enhanced bodyguard Jane to find somebody else capable of extracting the data and delivering it to those who need it.This film had promise but unfortunately ends up fairly average. The world shown is a clich dystopia the corporate elite live the good life and dress in sharp suits while everybody else seems to live in a wasteland in rough clothes and sporting facial tattoos. Keanu Reeves is okay as Johnny and Udo Kier is amusing as his agent but Takeshi Kitano is wasted as the corporate bad guy. The computer special effects are fairly dated now. If you can ignore these flaws or even enjoy their cheesiness the film isn't too bad.

There were many djvu moments of been there and done that.The star power was strong but given so very little to work with in the way of character back story. All the characters were two dimensional representations of stereotypes. The locations New Orleans  Panama were interesting choices but never really quite fit. While the movie wasn't action packed it moved at a good pace and kept my interest the whole time. The film work was solid as a whole. There was one particular action sequence that takes place around the halfway mark that was done very well.If you have a craving that only chicken nuggets will satisfy then I think you will come away fairly happy. Not a necessity to see on the big screen but that helps it a little. Leave your thinking cap outside that's the contraband that will keep you from enjoying this as it was intended.".

Chris our smuggler protagonist is deemed the Houdini of smuggling but in reality he's a general super badass who can talk fast kick ass and smuggle at superhero levels. We are then treated to the Mark Wahlberg show where it's hard to imagine anything adverse happening to him and we just go along with the ride.The movie is at its best after it sheds its GI6S intro and moves to the nitty gritty details of smuggling. The movie feels at home at sea where everything is calculated and ordered but while on land the movie is always bizarre violent and out of control. This lends for some really angular storytelling that keeps the movie exciting and interesting.It's great to see Kate Beckinsdale in the movies again though she plays the wife whose main role is to look great and be in distress a far cry from her iconic Underworld Selene or from her last movie Whiteout.On the whole it's a good action movie and if you liked Mark Wahlberg's previous movies like the Italian Job and Shooter you will also like this.".

He is strong in the action scenes on his smuggling trip to Panama  and he is just as good in dramatic scenes calling his wife to help her back home. He is a strong protagonist who is likable and draws a lot of empathy as he tries to fight the bad guys and save his family.Walberg is supported by a strong cast. Giovannis Ribisi does well as a dirty corrupt smuggler who terrorizes his family Ben Foster is excellent as Walberg's recovering addict and alcoholic exsmuggling parter who struggles to do the right thing. And Kate Beckinsale is great as Walberg's wife who also must fight to protect her family.The director does a great job of building intensity throughout the film. He brings the audience into the smuggling trade in a realistic and believable manner. And the director effectively engages the audience in the drama and action at three locations simultaneously as the film builds to its resolution back in New Orleans.Overall the film is a strong action film. If you dismiss the standard plot and some lapses of reality you'll enjoy the intense action strong acting and great scenery. Catch Contraband in the theaters to enjoy it on the big screen.Just be careful about smuggling your own candy into the theater.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was stuck for a film to see today so thought I'd go for this as had seen some good reviews.I was wary as I really don't think Mark Whalberg is a good actor. He's not had professional training and it shows in my opinion in all his films I've seen. He lacks emotional depth and it's almost acting by numbers. People who just 'turn to' acting do not have the necessary foundation skills to craft and hone over time as they've not studied it professionally. I know some people will disagree with my comments.I could not empathise or sympathise with ANY of these characters. The story is based in the drugs culture with Whalberg's character almost glamorising drugmoney smuggling. Certainly no moral ethics are seen here. I couldn't have cared less if his wife got buried in concrete in a plastic bag with her mobile phone to be honest. How can you sympathise with characters who are so caught up in their needs being met through a life of crime without even thinking of the impact of their behaviours and actions on others? Whalberg appears very bored right the way through. I don't know if anyone saw him on the Graham Norton show but he said he was tired and couldn't be bothered on that too and it showed. Perhaps he needs to retire now? The rest of the cast were very average. The direction was unremarkable as were the action scenes.I came out of the cinema just as the credits started to roll and felt angry that I'd sat through something which ultimately gave the message that drug crime pays. Try telling that to those of us who have or have had relatives who are hooked on the stuff and the shear hell it causes everyone else around them.Hated this film with avengence.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was stuck for a film to see today so thought I'd go for this as had seen some good reviews.I was wary as I really don't think Mark Whalberg is a good actor. He's not had professional training and it shows in my opinion in all his films I've seen. He lacks emotional depth and it's almost acting by numbers. People who just 'turn to' acting do not have the necessary foundation skills to craft and hone over time as they've not studied it professionally. I know some people will disagree with my comments.I could not empathise or sympathise with ANY of these characters.

	schema:reviewBody "Contraband is an exciting thriller full of suspense with a slight bit of comedy. Mark Wahlberg is always a fan favorite with his sarcasm and flattering physique. The movie takes place in New Orleans near the shipping yards where all the material is received to sell on the black market. Chris Farraday Wahlberg is a retired smuggler turned family man who now owns his own business selling alarm systems. Farraday is forced back into the contraband game when his brotherinlaw Andy Caleb Landry Jones owes his boss Tom Briggs a large sum of money due to the drug deal he failed to deliver. Everything does not go according to plan when Farraday goes to Panama with his team of smugglers to repay Andy's debt. The film is listed as an action movie but the action doesn't really start till half way through. The background of the story is delivered in a timely manner letting us know what will happen in the movie. Once the movie finally reaches the action in Panama the audience is at the edge of their seats. The ending reveals an unexpected twist that I thoroughly enjoyed. Overall it is another great movie with Wahlberg that I would recommend to friends.".

Yes it's true every film nowadays tends to slightly mirror another film but this film in particular has the familiarity of having a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. It might be okay for some people once and a while but most people want something a little more filling and unpredictable.Let's look at the flaws...1. Mark Wahlberg is fine but we've seen him sleep walk his way through movies like this many times already. It's always been tough to see him seriously as the action hero he's been taking on lately. I'd like to see him expand out and do more films like The Fighter or I Heart Huckabees. The rest of the cast is fine but it's only fine  No one is doing anything that they wouldn't normally play...everyone is in a comfort zone and there is nothing to care about for any of the characters on screen.2. 0 Originality. That wouldn't be terrible...sometimes you just need a good old action film to get you through the day...but this has no glamor and no game. Some action films seem like they're made up of best of moments from previous action films and this feels like they've borrowed a lot of worst of moments.3. No action. I'm serious. There is one scene that almost makes it to a thrilling full on chase but is short lived and is over before you care. Occasionally someone will get punched in the face and there are way too many gun pointing in faces but that's it.Let's look at what's good...1. J.K. Simmons is the one guy who breathes a little life into the ensemble. Yes he's still the fast talking funny man but he's put a nice little twist on what he usually is stuck with and is the only compelling person to watch on screen...2. It's got a good run time. Just under 2 hours  If only they had the right material to put in those two hours...3. Decent standard action soundtrack.3 stars out of 10. If you liked this movie or you would like a better recommendation on a similar sort of film... check out Gone In 60 Seconds or Oceans Eleven.Over and dead Fox Rain Matthews".

	schema:reviewBody "For every icon there is an unknown predecessor who paves the way. Before there was Kurt Cobain there was Ian Curtis lead singer of the postpunk band Joy Division. 27 years after his tragic death Curtis' incredible contribution to music is finally being recognized in Anton Corbijn's film Control. It's only fitting that Corbijn serve as director since it was his early photographs of Joy Division that reflected the band's dark introspective songs. Corbijn went on to photograph and direct videos for such musical greats as U2 David Bowie Depeche Mode R.E.M. and Metallica.With his first feature film Corbijn avoids the pitfalls of many music video directors who inundate us with flashy and unnecessary edits and camera angles. Instead he lets the stark black and white of the film tell the story of a lead singer tortured by epilepsy guilt depression and suicidal thoughts. The use of black and white also captures the factory town of Manchester England in the late 1970s a city crumbling under industrial and economic stress. Manchester has since rebounded and is once again thriving.Curtis is played by relative newcomer Sam Riley who's quiet and unassuming approach portrays an artist inspired by his heroes David Bowie and Iggy Pop. At a chance meeting following a Sex Pistols concert Curtis bonds with three fellow musicians to form the band.As Joy Division begins to flourish Ian's relationship with his young wife Deborah continues to distance itself. Academy Award nominee Samantha Morton plays the confused wife trying to understand her husband's depressed soul. The film is based on Deborah Curtis' autobiography Touching From A Distance so it comes as a surprise that Morton's character does not have more scenes in the movie.The key to Control is understanding Curtis' depression which the film accomplishes to near perfection. As he battles epilepsy the young singer lives in constant fear that his next seizure will be his last. His only option is to swallow a daily cocktail of prescription drugs with side effects so terrible that most of us would rather tempt fate than endure the aftermath of the pills.Ian's spirit is also tortured by overwhelming guilt brought on by an extramarital affair with a parttime journalist played by Romanianborn Alexandra Maria Lara.The most telling scene comes when Ian records an instudio track for the song Isolation. While Curtis stoically sings into the microphone his band mates are distracted with the normal banter that typically occurs in a studio.Mother I tried please believe me. I'm doing the best that I can. I'm ashamed of the things I've been put through. I'm ashamed of the person I am. The lyrics seem to fall on deaf ears except for those of the sound engineer who refers to it as genius. But Ian's brilliance is also a desperate cry for help ignored by everyone in the studio.The 27yearold Riley does an excellent job of capturing Curtis' aloofness on stage. Singers such as Jim Morrison Kurt Cobain and even the early years of Michael Stipe would often drift into the moment of the song. But when Curtis performed he immersed himself into his own world where the music simply served as the soundtrack. Riley skillfully draws us into Ian's dark world with a range of subtle head movements and facial expressions to a whirling explosion of arm gyrations that came to personify the singer's stage performances.Overwhelmed with grief shame and depression Ian finally succumbs to his demons at the young age of 23. He left behind a wife a child and a musical legacy that is finally receiving its just rewards nearly three decades later.For those looking for a story solely about Joy Division Control may not be for you. But for those seeking an intuitive perspective into the anguished spirit of one of the most influential alternative bands in history you will certainly find it in this depressing but incredibly beautiful film.".

His 'Ian' is physically and mentally complex. When I had managed to stop him on the Red Carpet long enough to congratulate him Mr Riley explains that he had a friend who was an epileptic. I witnessed an attack often enough to be able to copy it.Although the film has a driving energy that takes our breath away it drifts a little towards the tragic conclusion. We know the ending and it is a case of waiting for it to happen. And although it features plenty of excellent Joy Division tracks any music biopic will never be good enough or accurate enough for some fans.Fortunately this is not just for music fans but for serious film fans as well. It careers in a tightly controlled arc where music biopic meets cinematic excellence. Why should you see it? Some people visit the past for sentimental reasons says Corbijn. Some people visit the past to understand the present better. Control is not in the sentimental exercise category.".

His suicide not only ended his promising young life but also the dreams of a generation. Twenty seven years after his death the eulogizing continues. Last year saw a documentary by Christian Davies Joy Division Under Review and this year has brought two more films Joy Division The Last True Story In Pop by Grant Gee and Control the winner of the Camera d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Based on the 1996 memoir Touching From a Distance by Ian's widow Deborah Curtis the film follows Curtis' life from his teenage years to his tragic death at age twenty three.Unlike conventional biopics like Ray and Walk the Line with their star glamorizing propensities Control delivers a threedimensional portrait of a real human being and how his troubles affected the people closest to him. The film is directed by photographer and video director Anton Corbijn a celebrated photographer who took some of the most recognized photos of Joy Division. Because he knew and worked with the band the emotional connection to its subject is palpable. The film is shot in black and white and the choice underscores the grayness of Curtis' home town of Macclesfield England and the grim mood of much of the work.The major reason for the film's success however rests with lead actor Sam Riley who eerily recreates Curtis in appearance and voice. He performs all of the band's iconic songs such as Atmosphere Love Will Tear Us Apart and TwentyFour Hours himself using Curtis' robotic hand motions on stage to great effect. Another outstanding performance is that of Samantha Morton who plays Deborah Curtis Ian's loving and patient wife who is overwhelmed by her husband's success and her new responsibilities as a mother of their daughter. Married at a very young age both husband and wife lack the strength to make a go of it especially with the pressure of Curtis' epileptic seizures growing worse and Ian's on again off again affair with Belgian journalist Annik Alexandra Maria Lara.Though the subject matter is melancholy Matt Greenhalgh's script provides a light touch filled with trenchant oneliners from the group's manager Rob Gretton Tony Kebbell and witty remarks from band members Joe Anderson James Anthony Pearson and Harry Treadaway. Although Curtis has become one of rock's most mythologized figures Riley plays him simply as a very innocent down to earth young man whose talent was much greater than his ability to handle it. Control is an extremely moving experience whether or not you have foreknowledge of the events of Curtis' life. It is a film that has the power to touch and leave memories that are indelible.".

I think some things have been missed between the glowing reviews and the bitter disappointments.First it is a truly beautiful film and I found the acting uniformly excellent. That has already been said plenty of times.More interesting to me are the comments about this not being an accurate or fair portrait of Ian Curtis and those around him. I've read plenty of accounts that characterize Ian and his bandmates as relentless practical jokers  the book Torn Apart by Mick Middles and Lindsay Reade is full of these anecdotes. But I also think it's naive to expect a film like this to be anything close to a fair and objective telling of anyone's life. This is a dramatic interpretation not a documentary.In addition to the multiple meanings the title has for the characters in the film this film is itself an exercise in CONTROL Deborah Curtis's control over her husband's legacy the surviving band members' control over the public image of Joy Division.No the film does not show the laughs and good times the band had but this is in keeping with all of Joy Division's work. Their entire output as a living band was highly stylized. Almost everything they issued was in stark black and white their imagery was overwhelmingly bleak and funereal and they certainly courted controversy with their name and imagery. All of which was very consciously and tightly CONTROLLED by the band and the people at Factory. They gave few interviews and preferred to let the work speak for itself.My point is that this film simply continues that project. It is yet another highly stylized piece of work in the Joy Division canon. To paraphrase the Tony Wilson remark that has been cited elsewhere in these comments  when you have the choice between the legend and the facts go with the legend. Their work has always had an epic legendary quality. This movie is absolutely in keeping with that aesthetic.I think it's also worth noting that Corbijn was a participant in shaping the Joy Division legacy from the very start  his photographs of the band helped shape their image and his video for Atmosphere set the tone for how their legacy would be preserved. CONTROL is simply another collaboration with the band and their music. An extension of that original project.I think that ultimately this film is an excellent piece of work. Just as Joy Division produced music of astonishing beauty and resonance out of the misery of life in postindustrial England this film turns personal pain and loss into a powerful piece of art.".

I remember Ian Curtis's death like it was yesterday and no matter how many years roll by I still feel an immense sadness when listening to the bands poetic beauty. I was mightily relieved after reading Deborah Curtis's book Touching From A Distance for I found it refreshingly honest and certainly it helped people get in a bit deeper to just what a troubled young man Ian Curtis was. So here we are in 2008 and the film adaptation of that book has arrived with truly brilliant results.I have found it hard to write a comment for it because I have to cast aside my biased love of the band but hopefully I've managed to view it objectively with both my head and my heart. Control is a film about Ian Curtis the lead singer of the band Joy Division people expecting an indepth film about the band will be a little disappointed because this is the story of their lead singer a troubled young man who just couldn't face it anymore. Filmed in black  white to perfectly capture the essence of the man the film is about director Anton Corbijn has stayed loyal to the source material and crafted a haunting piece of work that lingers long after the final credits roll.We follow Ian Curtis from his humble music leanings in the early 70s here he meets Deborah who is soon to become his wife a married man at the age of 18. We watch him join a group of Manchester lads at a Sex Pistols concert it is here that the roots of Joy Division are formed. Then it's on to the formation of Factory records and the influential Svengali Tony Wilson. As the band start to make waves Ian Curtis becomes ill with epilepsy and it's here that Corbijn crucially shows that the doctors involved really didn't have a clue how to treat him properly trial and error with cocktails of drugs indeed.Deborah and Ian become parents to Natalie but Ian is away on the road for many days and nights and it's here that he yearns for love from another quarter and it's here that his infidelity will hang heavy on his already sunken shoulders. The band are set to make it big their manager announces that they are about to tour America for the first time this only adds another fraught string to Ian's already fractured bow the pressure of fame a lethal bedfellow with Messrs epilepsy and infidelity and then? I can't praise the work on this film enough Sam Riley relatively unknown outside of his hometown of Leeds is simply brilliant as Curtis dragging the viewer in completely on this desperately sad journey. Samantha Morton as Deborah is immense she nails the emotional seesaw role with professional aplomb and I would also like to raise a glass for the performance of the criminally undervalued Toby Kebbell Dead Man's Shoes Wilderness his turn as Joy Division's manager Rob Gretton is down pat. Director Corbijn clearly had love for the project and thankfully he was sensible enough to not over do the sentimental aspect of the troubled star. What Corbijn has done is perfectly frame the bleaker side of the story with old terraced houses and monstrous looking high rise's they scream out as dank and dreary statements in black  white yet they are overlooked by rolling hills to serve as a reminder when Curtis was at his happiest during the courtship with Deborah. Some scenes are unforgettable such is the power of the emotion on offer look out for the stunning appearance of heart tugging song Love Will Tear Us Apart a crucial and poignant scene and of course the film's tragic outcome hits like a sledgehammer. To which I thank Corbijn for giving us a very tasteful conclusion to this sad sad story.So there it is was I biased? I like to think I wasn't because I honestly feel that one doesn't have to be a fan of the band to get much from this movie. The film has won many awards and I'm happy to report that Control has brought renewed interest in the beautifulhaunting work of one of England's greatest ever bands. Remastered CDs reissued books and even Tshirts are selling well in the shops as I type.Control is a very sobering experience for fans and newcomers alike. 1010RIP Ian Curtis you are very much missed.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first thing that strikes you about 'Control' is its silence and the chilly beauty of its black and white images. As a still photographer firsttime director Anton Corbijn photographed Joy Division in black and white during their short existence.

	schema:reviewBody "Making the leap from photographer to music video director to film director Anton Corbijn's feature length debut 'Control' is quite simply stunning. Shot entirely in black and white it tell the story of Ian Curtis the lead singer with Manchester band Joy Division but its also much more than that it also tells of one mans journey into the heart of darkness Apocalypse Now is mentioned in the film a journey of fear paranoia illness and depression. Curtis has been played in films before but only as bit parts 24 hour party people etc here he is portrayed breathtakingly by Sam Riley who played Mark E Smith in 24 hour party people and when he first appears on the screen I have to admit I wasn't convinced but as Ian the person grows so too does Riley into the role and at times he has him so down to a tee its hard to imagine its not the real Curtis up there. The rest of the band are pretty good as well but are only really second fiddle to Riley but you have to give them credit for learning all the songs and playing them live rather than mime. Samantha Morton is great as the put upon wife Deborah and Craig Parkinson is convincing enough as Tony Wilson but apart from Riley's stand out performance its Toby Kebbell as manager Rob Gretton who has some of the best lines and has come so far since his role in 'Dead Man's Shoes'. The cinematography is a visual feast for the eyes being shot in black and white adds to the mood and gives a haunting feel that echo's the music and lyrics of the band it also means and I guess its Corbijn's photography background that so many of the shots in the movie could be still images they are framed so well. Although never really explained in terms of answers Curtis's illness from the seizures to the depression and the hopeless sense of falling apart reminded me of Catherine Deneuve in Polanski's 'Repulsion' another black and white film that deals with madness. I guess that treating mental illnesses was still in its infancy in the seventies yes we'd stopped electroshocking people but medications were still being developed and trialled. It seems it was very easy for Curtis to reach a certain point what with juggling home life on the road his condition and the pressure of increasing fame but when it came to helping him out he really was on his own and did feel a sense of 'isolation'. But with a story that has a widely known end point its more about the journey and here Corbjin punctures the narrative with some truly witty moments while leading up the incredibly moving and inevitable finale. Handled brilliantly by all involved this is another example of a great British film that deserves all the accolades it is receiving and if this performance is anything to go by expect Riley to be very big indeed.".

The first time actor is a name to watch. He is surrounded by a great cast but the film is carried on Riley's shoulders.His inner turmoil is conveyed with great humanity and realism. The audience was still and quiet for quite some time after the credits rolled at the screening I attended.There are some very clever and touching uses of the music in the film. Corbin uses the intensity of Curtis' lyrics to help paint a biographical picture of the man. The use of 'Love will tear us apart' in the movie was particularly inspired giving the context of the scene it was played in.

This film is beautifully made  almost like a 195060s kitchen sink film of the gritty north there are worse places than Macclesfield believe me!. I don't know Joy Divsion's work but the acting in this film by the major players was excellent. Sam Riley as Curtis is very very good as is Samantha Morton as his downtrodden wife. I thought the guy who played the manager was a bit OTT. What a shame that Tony Wilson died before this was released. My reaction to it was much like the one I had to Trainspotting. I was convinced that I wouldn't like it but came away feeling that this was a very important film. Even if you don't know Punk music or Joy Division  go along. Well worth it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was fortunate enough to live in Seattle and witness firsthand the grunge movement so the explosion of a musical sceneas what happened with postpunk in Manchester U.K. in the 70sfascinates me and I've been catching up with all that postpunk music that I missed out on back in the day. I loved Joy Division's dark sound and wondered why they didn't have a larger oeuvre of work. A little research revealed the reason to be lead singer Ian Curtis' suicide on the eve of the band's American tour in 1980. This intrigued me with Curtis and the band and I thought Joy Division had the makings of a good movie. And it does but this is not that movie. Having seen it I am amazed at the plethora of great reviews this film has gotten. It is perhaps the most mundane film ever made about rock and roll music! If a person had no knowledge of rock music and was first introduced to it through this film he would think that it was a product not of rage and angst but tedium and solitude.Control is unnecessarily filmed in black and white in the hopes of fooling dilettantes into believing it is high art and given the rave reviews from American critics it succeeds in its foolery. Director Anton Corbijn has used bw in previous films with rock subjects only to make the film look artistic because he has no cinematic idiom of his own. Corbijn never makes use of the shadows and light that are the very point for a modern filmmaker to us bw. Moreover this film needs to be in color to capture the grit and decline of Manchester in the period. Speaking of which the film never seems to step foot in any place but a bland suburb. To understand these characters and their motivations we need to see the decline of the industrial titan that was Manchester but we see only modest homes and verdant lawns. Just what dreadful life were they responding to with their music? The characters in this film live rather decently in what appears to be a bucolic setting. Even when the band makes a trip to London we only see shots of them in their car going to and fro. This is perhaps the most antiurban film ever made about an urban subject.Even worse there is no sense of a musical community and that is a grave crime given the burst of energy that emanated from Manchester in that period. If this film is to be believed Joy Division seemed to exist in a vacuum with inspiration coming only from David Bowie and Sex Pistols records with no acknowledgment to their peers and contemporaries.The entire genesis of creativity is given the short shrift as well. We see Curtis write poetry which presumably will become songs. He goes to his room and closes his door to shut himself off from the world but we never see the world that influenced his need for solitude. Curtis is not portrayed as a tortured soulwhich undoubtedly he must have beenbut as an easygoing bloke who doesn't even seem to disdain his civil service job. Sam Riley does well enough in his role as Curtis but never breaks through. You keep waiting for him to show us the magic but he only manages to during the concert scenes. But then how could any actor achieve that task? All Curtis does in this film is mope.Samantha Morton so good in other work is still good here but she isn't given much to do. The dissolution of her marriage happens fairly easily and without much complaint from her character. Toby Kebbell stands out as the band's manager Rob Gretton. Sadly he breathes the only excitement and energy into this whole enterprise. I would comment on the other band members but I couldn't tell one from the other. Whatever friendship existed between them was not brought to the screen and the other three band members are as much a backdrop as the sets. This movie would suggest that they were of no consequence when in fact they went on to form New Order and rise to the prominence for which Joy Division seemed destined.Even the film's title is a cryptic cop out. Joy Division's breakthrough hit was She's Out of Control but unlike Love Will Tear Us Apart it didn't reach a seminal status. Is Control a reference to Curtis' seizures? His personal life running astray? If so how is his experience unique enough to give this movie such a definitive oneword title? How is he in any less control of his life than Jim Morrison Kurt Cobain or Michael Hutchence were of their own? The title is generic and one can only guess that the movie was not called Love Will Tear Us Apart which would have been incredibly apt because of contractual issues.The biggest surprise about this film is that in spite of all its tepidness it has received great reviews from the likes of Roger Ebert and Peter Travers of Rolling Stone. Control had an 87 approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes! Anton Corbijn has fashioned a movie about rock music that is devoid of any of the energy zest or verve of the musical form. This film isn't the least bit enlightening about Ian Curtis Joy Division nor Manchester's postpunk music scene. It is blandly made employs stock moments from biographical films and only engages the viewer on a few occasions. Corbijn has a history of making movies about great rock subjects U2 Depeche Mode and draining every bit of life out the bands and their music. Now he has done the same for Joy Division. Skip right by Control and go directly to the documentaries Joy Division or the BBC produced Factory From Joy Division to Happy Mondays.".

	schema:reviewBody "About a third of the way through watching Control it occurred to me if this film were about somebody who wasn't famous it would be absolutely dull. As depicted in this film Ian Curtis was a very uninteresting person. Besides being the lead singer of Joy Division and I will take nothing away from the music he did nothing extraordinary with his life. Nor was he an extraordinary person. He displayed no feats of courage no wit he didn't stand for anything was indecisive lacking in charm passionless an atrocious father rarely smiled and possessed no ambition. I can see why he killed himself. So the question remains why are we watching this film?I have the feeling that there was a lot more to Ian Curtis than nice cheekbones intense stage presence and epilepsy. And if not then a point should be made of that. Is this the story of the shy kid who wanted to be David Bowie but then couldn't handle the fame? Was it just the pills that sent him spiraling? Is it a comment on just how normal he actually was? This film has no angle. The acting is excellent. The black and white photography is lovely. The sound design is superb.

	onyx:emotionText "About a third of the way through watching Control it occurred to me if this film were about somebody who wasn't famous it would be absolutely dull. As depicted in this film Ian Curtis was a very uninteresting person. Besides being the lead singer of Joy Division and I will take nothing away from the music he did nothing extraordinary with his life. Nor was he an extraordinary person. He displayed no feats of courage no wit he didn't stand for anything was indecisive lacking in charm passionless an atrocious father rarely smiled and possessed no ambition. I can see why he killed himself. So the question remains why are we watching this film?I have the feeling that there was a lot more to Ian Curtis than nice cheekbones intense stage presence and epilepsy. And if not then a point should be made of that. Is this the story of the shy kid who wanted to be David Bowie but then couldn't handle the fame? Was it just the pills that sent him spiraling? Is it a comment on just how normal he actually was? This film has no angle. The acting is excellent. The black and white photography is lovely. The sound design is superb.

	schema:reviewBody "Well...to be brutally honest it was terrible. The film was really very weak and didn't entice in any way. The thing looked quite nice all black and white monochrome photography but even that was only good in spurts. Full of rock biopic clich's it was simply too easy to watch a factor that jarred considerably with the dynamic that made Joy Division and Ian Curtis appeal to such a vast amount of people. This dynamic typified by eerie and haunting atmospheresexcuse me which seem horribly alienating at first but ultimately draw you in with the accurate depiction of the depths and despair of the human mind is something that sets the band apart from the crowd. They created their own unique sound that transcended boundaries and created a new strand of punk music. This film was an opportunity to apply that ethic to another medium to truly realise the essence of the man and the band.The line paraphrasing It feels like its somebody else just wearing my skin is indicative of the films outward appeal and its mainstream tendencies. In fact the film is far more malignant and sinister than Curtis' own dissolution.A travesty. The good bitsor the bits that weren't really bad which were mainly the parts where the band were playing gigs only served to make you feel horribly let down at how good the film could have been and how much of an injustice the source material had been paid. The casting seemed good on paper having an unknown playing the main part and giving Samantha Morton a supporting role as the suffering wife. But it just didn't work. Morton was a clich of the downtrodden and doting wife all watery eyed and desperately attempting to put their problems out of her mind and Sam Riley was far too much like a certain more modern 'punk icon' Pete Doherty. It was bizarre I couldn't get him out of my mind the big drawn eyes the wiry gangly frame the cocky charm the theatrically wistful stare it was ridiculous... And from what's been written nothing like Ian Curtis he wasn't attractive he wasn't likable he was an ugly cold selfinvolved person and knew it. I won't mention the rest of the cast as I feel I may just sound like an angry Joy Division fan. Suffice to say the earlier comment about rock biopic clichs applies.I was so disappointed thought it was going be good and it just wasn't. Simple as that. And I hate it when films try to condone suicide its such a pathetic thing to do the guy had plenty of people who cared about him but still he screwed them all over. Some would argue that it doesn't condone it it simply shows it but this I would disagree with. Saying that go see it the songs are played well for the most partthe band who play Joy Division are actually a Leeds band in real life and actually play the songs and there are one or two really nice shots of Maccelsfield! particularly towards the start. One in particular of the couple sat under a tree just before he proposes sticks out. You may like it I don't know it seems plenty of people do for some reason!I appreciate that many will disagree with my opinions which is fine but just know that I care very much about cinema and am very worried and disturbed when films such as this receive such acclaim.".

Such a shame since Control is a well made if somewhat slowpaced and no surprise here depressing film. Evocatively shot in black and white by Martin The Countess Ruhe and directed by Depeche Mode and others video artiste Anton Corbijn also a former NME photographer and longtime Joy Division fan Control limns the short bleak life of Ian Curtis the band's illfated lead singer.Beautifully acted by leads Sam On the Road Riley and Samantha Sweet and Lowdown Morton along with a fine supporting ensemble Control paints a stark portrait of a young man unable to weather the intertwining conflicts of love notoriety and adult responsibility. It wasn't love that tore him apart so much as it was as the film's title seems to indicate an inability to deal with his own poorly developed selfcontrol. Being epileptic assuredly didn't help no doubt exacerbating Curtis' depressions and sense of helplessness but ultimately the final arbiter of his suicide was no one and nothing but his own fragile conflicted will. He had a fine wife a child an expanding place in the sun a vehicle for his creative impulse and yet he couldn't help but throw it all away first by betraying his family and ultimately by betraying himself. Control has plenty of moral questions to pose and to the filmmakers' credit offers neither facile nor concrete answers. The sparse linear screenplay by Matt Greenhalgh who's written another script now in production concerning John Lennon's early life is based on a Curtis bio written by his widow which I've not read and feels fairly objective and nonjudgmental at least to this viewer. I suspect that the director's personal relationship with the Curtises had much to do with that.In a nutshell absolutely worth a watch for Joy Division devotees Morton andor Riley fans and lovers of small effective characterdriven cinema. Highly NOT recommended for puerile mainstream audiences who regard Transformers movies or gimmicky films like Cloverfield as high art.".

What I've loved over the years with Corbjin's work as a photographer is how he manages to capture the essence and spirit of his subject matter whatever it may be. He does this to a remarkable degree in Control.Control is a biopicportrait of Ian Curtis lead singer of the Manchester band Joy Division. Just as the band was beginning to build a name for itself Curtis took his own life in 1980. He was only 23 years old.With any biopic where the central character is deceased there lies the inherent problem of maintaining audience interest when the conclusion of the story is known. Corbjin does this beautifully via a number of things he does in Control. The very striking cinemascope black and white photography has a very warm and tactile feel to it. It sounds like a clich but one feels that time and place that the film depicts.The extraordinary cinematography is combined with a strong sympathetic script and wonderful performances from a largely unknown cast. Sam Riely is an absolute revelation as Ian Curtis. Having only seen this actor in a small role in Michael Winterbottom's 24 Hour Party People which covered some of the same ground that Control does Riely really holds the screen as Curtis. While not physically identical he absolutely manages to capture Curtis' feeling of displacement and depression. Definitely a young actor to watch.The only 'name' actor in the film is Smantha Morton who plays Ian's wife Debbie. An exceptional actress who doesn't disappoint here. The actors who play the other members of Joy Division are quite effective and bring a welcome sense of humour and gravity to what is at times an intense and depressing story.Highly recommended. My pick of 2007 so far.".

	schema:headline " Half of a virtuoso piece";
	schema:reviewBody "Two years spent salivating on this project. Anton Corbijn directs a biopic about Ian Curtis! Can life get any better? ooh well. It came out as a weird documentary with maximum emphasis on two aspects at opposite end of the spectrum and unfortunately some shallowness in the middle.It's directed by whom I consider the best living photographer I've been a lifelong fan. And he won't disappoint me about his visual talent every single scene in CONTROL is visually perfect pure Corbijn perfectly balanced black and whites nearly mathematical composition a scene of Curtis asleep at his work table made me gasp for its total formal beauty algebra in black and white.Beautiful are they? Imagine two hours of this     The mind never really gets into the flow of the story at least MY mind never did it was like watching that Corbjin exhibition in Groningen in 2000 where I walked slackjawed in the museum halls. As much as I love Corbjin's work I find that his virtuossism here may be distracting if you're a fan.So the cinematography is outstanding. The other outstanding thing is the acting by this kid I've never heard Sam Riley born in 1980 bless him who plays Curtis. At the beginning one is suspectful the kid is way too cute one fears that his good looks will be distracting. But you slowly come to respect and admire his performance he has Curtis nailed down. We must remember that the movie is based on Curtis' wife's memories and she may have quite a chip on her shoulder but the other members of the band AND Tony Wilson are VERY much alive and kicking so I trust that all the facts are punctual and realistic.This is simply the story of a weak kid who got himself in a situation that was too big for himself and he didn't know the way out. When everything was simpler as he says around the end of the movie he had hastily married and had a child he was in a small band and playing gave him pleasure. Then things became too much he developed epilepsy the drugs for it were a constant torture and made him drowsy he fell asleep at work lost his job he quickly got tired of his wife and showed no kind of emotional relationship with his little daughter whom he only looks at with disconcert she is another cause of his losing control over his own life a gorgeous Belgian lover quickly became more of a pain than a relief as he obviously gets discovered by his wife and he finds himself in the middle of a tug of war between the two women. Worst of all he is becoming quite famous now but he has lost the enjoyment that music gave him he thinks the public doesn't understand him one night he actually refuses to go on stage and when he finally does the strain of it gives him an epileptic attack. In his view there is nothing left living for. End of it.Sam Riley is surprisingly good at conveying Curtis' slow descent into hopelessness. The director sure makes him cry an awful lot but one fears that Curtis was exactly like this in real life. He was simply a kid too weak for the kind of life that he could have had and that looms over him like a threat more than a promise  global success money a loving wife a daughter and God knows how many lovers Belgian or not. Riley's performance is restrained he never goes over the top not even towards the end. I suspect that the son of the Calvinist pastor surely would never have allowed him all the performances are dignified and restrained even Samantha Morton as the very patient wife perhaps too normal a wife for him? One gets the feeling they didn't really connect she loves to live in Macclesfield Curtis whines is not too emotive this is a very everyday tragedy.So the lead actor is good and the cinematography is good. What's left in the middle  the MOVIE itself  is a bit disappointing more a documentary than a movie. Nobody explains us what was in the young musician's mind HOW the band who up to that moment had grown listening to glam rock  as the soundtrack lavishly proves  came out with such a different restrained sound the band gets more and more famous but we have no perception of that if not by some awkward dialogue boys we're getting bigger! We're going to America! so the audience can't really feel what influence fame had on Curtis. Luckily there are no big musical moments just snippets after all this is not a movie about Joy Division it's a movie about the strange depressing and depressed boy who fronted it.Is it worth seeing? Oh yes everyone will go. NonCorbijn fans will have a better time than I did because they will see the movie not the cinematography. Would I buy the DVD and keep it forever? No. 24 HOUR PARTY PEOPLE is more effective in describing Curtis' short life with some emotion  and that was a comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this film the other night at the Mill Valley Film Festival and have mixed feelings about it.First its strongest point  the cinematography. The blackandwhite photography on this film is topnotch as one would expect from a film directed by an acclaimed photographer like Anton Corbijn. Although Corbijn is working with a d.p. Marin Ruhe the look of the movie is clearly his and the shots of people in relation to architecture the angles and the creative shots of light poles and other city features are all classic Corbijn. The biggest departure from Corbijn's signature look is that film doesn't go with the overcooked grainy look of his photographs.But as for the quality of the storyline what can I say  its a biopic. Which is a genre with a lot of limitations and one that is rarely spectacular. Control is no exception in this regard telling a fairly linear tale of a tortured and selfdestructive artist. Nothing much new here. Some of the use of musical cues are really hamfisted such as the scene where Curtis breaks it to his wife that he's no longer in love with her which immediately segues into a montage built around Love Will Tear Us Apart Again. But considering that Corbijn is the same person who directed the visually evocative yet schmaltzy video for Atmosphere back in the 80s this isn't surprising. The film also makes for an interesting comparison with Michael Winterbottom's 24 Hour Party People a very different movie that nonetheless is about many of the same characters and events. Given that Winterbottom's movie came out only 5 years earlier than Control many of the events in Control are quite familiar to the audience from the earlier movie and its interesting to see how Control handles this. In several cases such as the scene that shows the initial meeting of Tony Williams and Ian Curtis the scenes play out more or less the same but are shown from Curtis' point of view rather than Williams. In fact the scene in which Williams signs a contract with Joy Division in his own blood is even included in Control even though this is apparently an apocryphal story that was made up for 24 Hour Party People.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start out by stating that I am a fan of Joy Division. I love both of their studio albums and I feel that Ian Curtis' lyrics possess a deep and alluring poetry despite the suggested darkness and nihilism contained within. Strangely enough I usually avoid watching films solely because they concern themselves with interesting true life stories this is because they are usually badly done. The director feels as if she needs to tell the story in a particular way with particular motifs. They are usually badly paced as a result of trying to stitch together a real story whilst having to artificially give prominence to certain events which the fans expect to see not just included but emphasised. And they generally lack inspiration as works of art in themselves far too often feeding off the legend that surrounds the subject matter rather than actually adding anything new in terms of creativity or insight. This film is guilty of all these things and will only further entrench my reluctance to watch films about interesting true life stories in future.How does this film get it wrong? Well first of all Corbijn comes across as uncreative and uninteresting as a directorial presence. His pacing is poor there are far too many uninteresting drawnout scenes particularly the one with Ian and Annik alone which should never have made the final cut it was so dull I thought I might go into a trance. He also fails to provide the right pacing for us to understand why Ian goes from being a bit insular but basically a pretty balanced and ambitious guy to a confused ill depressed whining selfdestructive maudlin presence. It's almost as if he has a personality transplant halfway through the film and is just one example of where this film is actually jarring. Let me also mention the cinematography. I'm not one of those people who has a problem with black and white films in any way shape or form. Films like Europa Manhattan and Raging Bull are wonderful examples of black and white cinematography used to fascinating effect. But this film is an example of when black and white photography is a completely redundant and yes I'm going to say it pretentious exercise. It added nothing to the film at all no mood no aesthetic quality nothing. In fact it serves to disengage the viewer from the time period which is early 70s through to 1980. You know how ridiculous the decision is when Ian's watching Stroszek a film released in 1976 and filmed in colour in black and white it just adds a layer of confusion that shouldn't be in the film we should be connecting not unnecessarily visually disconnected from the story.I could talk about the lack of character development the mediocre acting from Sam Riley the complete and utter lack of insight that we get into Ian Curtis' character Joy Division the band and even the Manchester music scene of the 70s but I'd be here for a long while. In short there is very little that is interesting or of value in this film a documentary on Ian Curtis and Joy Division on youtube would serve as a much better investment of your time.310".

	schema:reviewBody "James Hamilton Haskel James Stewart is a smalltown kind of guy who'd much rather run his dad's music store and let kids practise the piano and trumpet in his shop than work for the Haskel health food business run by his Uncle Charley Charles Winninger. Unfortunately he's also got to eat so he finally accepts Uncle Charley's offer of a chance to get to know the business better... only to turn up in town and immediately befriend the very musical McCorkle family including Ma Mary Gordon who cooks for everyone in the band and takes care of them like a big mother hen and Molly Paulette Goddard. The McCorkles and Horace Heidt's band play swing music on the roof just next to the Haskel factory which drives poor musichating Uncle Charley completely batty. Ma McCorkle and Uncle Charley are bitter rivals but the oblivious younger generation well Molly at least doesn't know that Jimmy is the Haskel Health Food heir quickly become friends and of course! fall in love thanks to a tomato misthrown a doughnut shared and a harmonica rendition of 'Pete The Piper'. Jimmy decides to use his uncle's radio show the Haskel Happiness Hour to promote Molly and Horace Heidt's band and hopefully heal the HaskelMcCorkle rift. This results in a hilarious sequence in which Jimmy has to convince Uncle Charley that the latter has gone crazy and hears all kinds of music through the vents and floors on the phone and sees girls dancing in the garden... all to get him out of town. When Molly finally does find out that Jimmy is a Haskel though she angrily announces on the air that the Haskel Happiness Hour would be giving away a thousand dollars every weekwhich infuriates Uncle Charley listening in from Canada and gets Jimmy in trouble... how to give the money away without making it a lottery? And how are the now bickering twosome going to get back together again?A musical is really the last type of movie you'd figure James Stewart to be in but that's exactly what POT O'GOLD is... and oddly enough it doesn't really suffer for it. All the songs including the opening 'Hi Cy What's Cookin'?' 'Pete The Piper' and 'Broadway Caballero' with great vocals by Goddard are toetappingly catchy and cute and actually function quite successfully as an extension of the plot. I also really like the cutlerybanging number performed to initiate Jimmy into the McCorkle Clan but am especially partial towards the rousing jailhouse singsong 'Johnny Toots His Horn'... which not only features Jimmy Haskel playing the harmonica but also Jimmy Stewart singing! And he doesn't sound bad at allit was probably a good choice to limit his singing voice to the one song and use a song that fit his limited range well. Instead of appearing a fool he comes off well and one can actually believe that Jimmy Haskel's a musicloving musical guy. My favourite number however is Molly's dream sequence to the sweet ballad 'Do You Believe In Fairy Tales?'. As Molly drifts off to sleep and awakens to find herself dressed as a princess she cranes her neck eagerly to look for her knight in shining armour riding a white steed... and there he is! Or is he? In a selfconsciously anticlimactic and therefore truly hilarious moment Jimmy Haskel saunters in as... Jimmy Haskel. Same suit same hat same harmonica. He serenades her in Horace Heidt's borrowed voice then twitches noticeably when she 'romantically' empties a bucket of flowers over his head. The scene is written and executed with tongue planted very firmly in cheek satirising the romantic dreams of a young girl while making a sweet but very subtle point that Molly loves Jimmy exactly as he already is. He doesn't need to be a knight in shining armour he's just Jimmy. It's a point she forgets later and finally learns again when she discovers his last name is Haskel. It's a great song a great scene and Stewart is incredibly... well the only word for him is 'cute'.That goes for pretty much the entire filmhis character has of course the typical Stewart soft side this time manifested in his love of music and his ability to connect with and touch others through its language. But there's a harder edge in Jimmy Haskel too manifested by his willingness to pull the wool over his poor uncle's eyes or when he's sniping rudely at Molly after they've 'broken up' before ever really getting together!. Stewart ultimately creates a very real character a sweet guy who isn't perfect who isn't averse to a lie now and then and more than willing to give as good as he gets. It's Molly who starts the bickering thumping him on the head and pulling him down the stairs to wake him up spraying him with seltzer waterhe only returns the final favour. James Hamilton Haskel is no patsy and no paragon of virtue... and Stewart gives him the charm and the awshucks demeanour Haskel needs to be plausibly taken into the bosom of the McCorkle family as he so quickly is. The rest of the cast is excellent as well considering how much this really is Stewart's film from screen time to performanceWinninger is fantastic as CJ Haskel the unreasonable tycoon whose hatred of music sets him up as the villain of the piece... it's a shame that he suddenly seems to be transformed into a new man at the end though that could be explained by the lucrative prospects in the revamped radio show. Gordon makes a great Ma McCorkle bustling cheery and most importantly not annoyinghowever saintly and Irish she gets. Her raucous laughter is probably the key to remaining likable! Goddard also puts up a fine show she's great when she's onscreen and has a really good singing voice as well.POT O'GOLD really is an excellent filmnot a classic but excellent. It may not be everyone's cup of tea... but I personally don't think the film is uneven. It's meant to be funny to be a little madcap to be sweet. It's a romantic comedy told in musical form just like SINGIN' IN THE RAIN though certainly not on its level. In the end it's just a film that makes you smile from beginning to end that stars James Stewart in his prime which is very prime indeed and that even sings to youa language everyone can understand. In fact its musical sequences are inventive charming and even genius in one case. If you're a fan of Stewart this is definitely a film you'll want to watchyou'll be as pleasantly surprised as I was on discovering the charm of POT O'GOLD!".

Speaking of the last it is a pity that JS and KH did not work together more.The pace is frenetic ala Marx Brothers the dance and musical numbers done very well and the emphasis is on having the minimum story necessary to string together the music.There is a subtle but very special scene near the end when Paulette Goddard goes to Jimmy's place to rouse him out and get him to the studio for the climactic radio show. It is not a musical number though there is a great deal of physical comedy in the scene. What makes it special special part is without rhythm or music that it is very clear that Paulette Goddard is dancing. The blocking direction and her own talent shine. This one scene is worth the price of admission.With a story in the best tradition of American Musical Tradition more talent per actor than many better known and better thoughtof films this is a very enjoyable diversion. I was constantly impressed with the tight writing and talent. Did I mention that the folks are good?It ain't 'Grapes of Wrath' but 'Pot 'O Gold' is well worth the watching.".

The story has that Shakespearean comedy feeling comedy driven by mistaken identity which ends in marriage. Some good color added by journeyman studio character actors. There's some nicely blended musical numbers which mesh naturally with the story ... then there's the big production number during the radio program which feels like it dropped in from another planet and during the boarding house initiation number I kept worrying about the stew getting cold. Aside from the musical interludes the story is tight and never loses its way delivering comic payoffs all along.".

The story has that Shakespearean comedy feeling comedy driven by mistaken identity which ends in marriage. Some good color added by journeyman studio character actors. There's some nicely blended musical numbers which mesh naturally with the story ... then there's the big production number during the radio program which feels like it dropped in from another planet and during the boarding house initiation number I kept worrying about the stew getting cold. Aside from the musical interludes the story is tight and never loses its way delivering comic payoffs all along.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was found in the dollar bin at WalMart and it couldn't be resisted simply because Jimmy Stewart movies are worth watching even oldies like Pot of Gold. Clear back in 1941 his trademark common man persona was much in evidence with this quirky little madcap comedymusical. Considering this movie came just five years prior to It's a Wonderful Life it's surprising it hasn't received more notice. The plot in a nutshell is that Stewart has to close up his music shop due to poor business and goes to the city to go work for his cranky rich uncle. Along the way Stewart becomes involved with a band a pretty Irish girl thrown in jail and could be arrested for running a illegal lottery. While there are plenty of madcap moments honest understated humor and delightful performances it's the music that is absolutely incredible! Jimmy Stewart bluffs his way fairly incredibly on the harmonica and even sings a song. It may not have been his favorite movie but it is still a Jimmy Stewart gem. Even if you have to pay more than a dollar to watch the movie it's still a movie especially for Jimmy Stewart fans to find and enjoy. The dining room musical number is worth the rental fee alone but dig through the WalMart dollar bins anyway.".

Second the war is winding up and here is a Big Band inspired kind of cheerleading about community and keeping a good face on things as the world falls apart. Director George Marshall clearly had a mandate from somewhere not to take this too seriously. Even as a musical it's got some creaky story elements and a number of forced scenes. But it's the 1940s and Hollywood has really learned how to crank out a good movie so this one is fast has some great musical numbers and is tightly if conventionally filmed. Besides Stewart is Paulette Godard who is an underrated natural once upon a time Charlie Chaplin's wife she had the starring role in Modern Times. It's also fun to see Stewart pretending to play harmonicahe's right on the with it so he probably played pretty well.So no great shakes here unless you like that period music a lot.".

For some reason unfathomable to me his bands always seemed to come out on the second tier of music history while lesser groups are remembered fondly. Ah well I guess that's the music business and he did well enough before he left it to be a professional investor.I met the man in 1964 a time closer to this movie than to now. He said a few things to me about music that I have never heard as intelligently since. From anyone. About any art.The story here is a well built one a food magnate with a cannon in his plant to puff rice has a feud going with the boarding house next door which houses Horace's band. The businessman's nephew comes to town and falls in love with the innkeeper's daughter.The device of the show is a radio show that Steward takes over and which hosts the band.Its a musical and true to the form at the time has no consistency to how the music finds an excuse to appear. Sometimes it is a show within the show. Even then there's some strangeness. A big number is for a radio audience but morphs into an elaborately costumed dance stage routine.Sometimes it is somewhat real with the bandmembers just breaking into song and that developing into a number. And sometimes its strangely internal where the thing stops being real and itself becomes a show. I think this was not deliberate but a simple affirmation of what they thought the audience would accept. Much of the music except the big stage number is more musically exciting than what you normally find in movie musicals. I'd recommend it on that basis.And there are some nifty cinematic jokes too a few quite clever mixed in with the corny ones.The radio show in the movie was based on a real radio show of the same name and gimmick featuring Horace Heidt so there's yet another fold for the show within the show.If you don't care about the movie and its story and few folks seem to with musicals and you think of musical numbers more in terms of musical than big dance numbers you will like this. You will.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".

I'd recommend it on that basis.And there are some nifty cinematic jokes too a few quite clever mixed in with the corny ones.The radio show in the movie was based on a real radio show of the same name and gimmick featuring Horace Heidt so there's yet another fold for the show within the show.If you don't care about the movie and its story and few folks seem to with musicals and you think of musical numbers more in terms of musical than big dance numbers you will like this. You will.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.";

POT O'GOLD also has the distinction of being both presented and produced for the only time by James Roosevelt older son of the then current United States president Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Independently made it also has the distinction of starring not two newcomers on the rise but two major actors on loanout assignment from their home base studios James Stewart from MetroGoldwynMayer and Paulette Goddard from Paramount. Other than being the movie debut of bandleader Horace Heidt it has little to offer except for the presence of recent Academy Award winner James Stewart in what he claimed to be his worst movie. Maybe not his very worst except only when watching bad reproductive copies on video or DVD but one of his lesser contributions with fine actors performing to secondrate script with thirdrate songs to boot.The story revolves around James Hamilton Haskell James Stewart a harmonica player who has inherited his late father's music store. Because business is failing his rich uncle Charles J. Haskell Charles Winninger sponsor of the weekly radio program Haskell's Happiness Hour offers Jimmy the opportunity of going into business with him. As much as Jimmy loves music his uncle detests it especially when his establishment happens to be across the alley of Mrs. McCorkle's Mary Gordon boardinghouse on 419 63rd Street where Horace Heidt and his band play their music on the rooftop. As Jimmy arrives to meet with his uncle he encounters Mrs. McCorkle's daughter Molly Paulette Goddard singer of the band who during a disruption between the McCorkles and the Haskills unwittingly throws a tomato at his uncle's face thus becoming a hero to the McCorkles and tenants of the building. As Jimmy tries to hide his identity from Molly and her friends he attempts on helping the music makers by having them appear on his uncle's radio program without his knowledge.Other members of the cast include Frank Melton Jasper Dick Hogan Willie McCorkle Jed Prouty J.K. Louderman James Burke Officer Grady and Charles Arnt Parks the Butler. Notable performance goes to Mary Gordon in another one of many stereotypical strongwilled Irish motherlandlady Charles Winninger playing a sort of role he's done hundreds of times before with the only exception of not being an entertainer who feels vaudeville will be making a comeback and future TV personality Art Carney Ed Norton of The Honeymooners briefly playing an announcer during the radio giveaway segment.Though Stewart is not actually associated with musicals interestingly POT O'GOLD happens to be his fourth and second for which he sings a song or two. The motion picture soundtrack with tunes by unfamiliar composers as Lou Forbes Henry Sucher Dave Franklin Mark David and Vee Lawnhurst is as follows Hi Cy Pete the Piper Man sung by Paulette Goddard By the Moonlight When Johnny Toots His Horn sung by James Stewart Hail McCorkle A Knife a Fork and a Spoon My Irish Stew Oh Boarder House Do You Believe in Fairy Tales? sung by band members later sung by James Stewart during dream sequence and The Caballero from Broadway. Of the songs The Cavallero from Broadway gets the production number treatment choreographed by Larry Ceballos. A lively tune and well staged it's something best appreciated from the standpoint of the story for television as opposed to listening radio audience who couldn't very well see what they are hearing otherwise the score is a far cry from being Irving Berlin Cole Porter or a George Gershwin. I doubt is any one of these composers would ever consider such title songs as A Knife A Fork and a Spoon and make a success of it.While POT O'GOLD reportedly began its broadcasting on television during its earliest years before disappearing by the mid 1950s it wasn't until the advent of cable television and home video did POT O GOLD having become a public domain movie title began to find a new audience by the early 1980s especially on public television.

	schema:reviewBody "James 'Jimmy' Stewart once reportedly said that he considered Pot o' Gold his worst film. Well it is certainly nowhere near among his best work one of his weakest actually and it is kind of easy to see why he would think that. But even lesser Stewart is worth seeing even if it is only once because Stewart was that good an actor.Pot o' Gold's biggest debit is the story. There is very little to it structurally and it does struggle to sustain the running time which is not that long. It could also have done with some tightening up with some parts that felt creaky and forced. Stewart and Paulette Goddard I felt did lack romantic chemistry apart from the odd charming moment it felt more clinical than natural and tender and it did seem like they weren't that fond of one another.Scriptingwise Pot o' Gold has mixed results. A good deal of it is witty and quite funny and there is a likeably feelgood honesty. Other parts however are a touch hokey and contrived as if they were really to raise laughs but were struggling to do so and crisper timing and more freshness might have helped.It is a goodlooking film though. It is not exactly lavish and there are times where it looks like it was made quickly but on the most part it does look pretty and like it was made with professionalism so it hardly looks cheap. Also loved the film's quaint period charm. The music score has the appropriate amount of whimsy and the songs while not the most memorable for a musical are tuneful energetic and enough to leave the feet tapping. Do You Believe in Fairy Tales and With a Knife a Fork and a Spoon don't worry the song is not as silly as the title sounds are particularly fun. The choreography is spirited and doesn't try to do anything too complicated neither does it get simplistic also managing to keep within the lightweight feel of the rest of the film. The dream sequences are imaginatively surreal and colourful without being too heavyhanded or inappropriate.George Marshall's direction is lively and does a good job keeping the film light and bouncy. While not always working the humour is mostly feelgood witty and honest and the film does have a sweet charm regardless of the story's flaws. Stewart has a great easygoing charisma and a sparkling twinkle and acquits himself reasonably well in the singing department and Goddard who is much better than she was in Second Chorus is beautiful and fiery. Good amusing support too from Charles Winniger particularly excellent and Mary Gordon and while there could have been a little less of him Horace Heidt does fine too and is in no way a liability.To summarise Pot o' Gold passes the time more than amiably and is a decent enough film but considering Stewart's calibre as a personal favourite actor of mine and as a fan of musicals this viewer was hoping for more. 610 Bethany Cox".

In terms of the rest of the movie the plot is thin and doesn't quite deliver on the comedic mayhem for which this story certainly has the potential. The dialogue isn't quite as quick and witty as one would like because this is where Jimmy Stewart shines the brightest in films like 'Harvey' 'Philadelphia Story' and 'Destry Rides Again' with his slow drawl and deadpan delivery. The musical numbers are generally well integrated with good music until the Caballero song towards the end which drags on too long and seems to suffer from Busby Berkeley envy. But then again who doesn't?Overall this is a quality film especially for devoted fans of Mr. Stewart.".

Based on a radio giveaway program of the same title this musical comedy stars my favorite actor James Stewart as the harmonicaplaying James Hamilton Haskel Jimmy for short who owns a floundering music shop that becomes a freeforall practice venue for aspiring young musicians. Costarring is the mostlikelyforgotten commercial bandleader Horace Heidt along with his Musical Knights who rehearse at a boarding house owned by the benevolent Ma McCorkle Mary Gordon whose daughter Molly Paulette Goddard sings with the band. Nextdoor to this melodic funhouse is the health food factory owned by Jimmy's uncle Charlie Charles Winninger who absolutely despises music. Ironically Charles Winninger was a trombonist in real life. The director of this fun little picture is George Marshall who also directed Mr. Stewart and Mr. Winninger in the more successful musical comedy Western Destry Rides Again 1939.My favorite scenes from Pot o' Gold include the following. As Jimmy walks down the street carrying his suitcase he is astonished to find some of the working class e.g. icemen Chinese launderers and shoe shiners singing along with Horace Heidt's band which can be heard from Ma McCorkle's rooftop. At the jail Jimmy and his cell mates have a wonderful time as they sing When Johnny Toots His Horn and dance to Jimmy's harmonica playing some of you Three Stooges aficionados out there will notice supporting actor Bud Jamison who had a fine singing voice himself portraying one of the cell mates Jimmy's singing voice during this scene is also quite pleasant to listen to. At the dinner table Jimmy is given a lively musical induction into the McCorkle clan. And when Jimmy first observes Horace Heidt's band in rehearsal he secretly whips out his harmonica and joins in the band realizes what a commodity it has in Jimmy and allows him to sit in on another arrangement involving an entire chorus of harmonicas.James Stewart considered Pot o' Gold to be the worst movie ever in which he appeared. Certainly it does not even compare with say Vertigo 1958 or The Naked Spur 1953. It is also a shame that all the various swell musical numbers in this film are very much forgotten and that Stewart  Paulette Goddard supposedly did not get along very well on the set. But Pot o' Gold is still an enjoyable movie nonetheless even if it does not rate among the more significant movies of Mr. James Stewart.".

The rest of the plot and how they brought Paulette Goddard into this mess of a film is really irrelevantas there are so many distracting and forgettable songs that it seems less of a movie and more of a long series of music videos strung along by a tenuous plot! What a waste to make a film like this when you have Jimmy Stewart! In fact after a while I was so tired of this dull film that I really had to struggle to watchit was that bad. I recommend this film only for film historians and people who insist on seeing EVERY Stewart film!".

The rest of the plot and how they brought Paulette Goddard into this mess of a film is really irrelevantas there are so many distracting and forgettable songs that it seems less of a movie and more of a long series of music videos strung along by a tenuous plot! What a waste to make a film like this when you have Jimmy Stewart! In fact after a while I was so tired of this dull film that I really had to struggle to watchit was that bad. I recommend this film only for film historians and people who insist on seeing EVERY Stewart film!";

How did James Stewart an actor who probably is in the top 10 of alltime great stars land in this film? Especially after just winning the Oscar.Pot o' Gold appears to have been an independent production by one James Roosevelt FDR's son and it was distributed through United Artists. It's about a young man James Hamilton Haskel who runs his dad's music store. The store isn't doing well and his Uncle Charley Charles Winninger wants him to be part of his big health food business. James accepts for financial reasons. Uncle Charley is going crazy with the swing music being played next to his factory by the McCorkle family and Horace Heidt's band. Ma McCorkle and Uncle Charley hate one another. Without knowing that he's related to Uncle Charlie the daughter Molly Paulette Goddard falls for James. This leads to all sorts of complications culminating on a radio show the Haskel Happiness Hour.This is a midlevel musical at best with Jimmy doing some of his own singing though he's also dubbed and Paulette Goddard who came close to being Scarlett O'Hara is dubbed all the way through. The band music is very good.Pot o' Gold has a lowbudget look to it and supposedly James Stewart hated this film. I can't blame him. I just don't know how or why he and Goddard became mixed up in it.".

Hoarce Heidt  his Musical Knights racked up 52 hits between 1937 and 1945 when Heidt left music to go into real estate. Over it's run the band scored several charttoppers including Gone With The Wind TiPiPin and I Don't Want To Set The World on Fire. Amazingly none of the Pot O' Gold soundtrack songs ever became hits. Pianist Frankie Carle cornet star Bobby Hackett sax man Frank DeVol electric guitarist Alvino Rey and singers Mary Martin Gordon MacRae The King Sisters and yes comedian Art Carney too all put in their time on the Heidt bandstand.

Liota's character although well acted seemed to have too drastic a turn around in too short a time to really show the process and allow the viewer to relate. There is nothing terribly wrong with this film other than it's ending which was entirely expected felt rushed clichd and underdeveloped.

He looked up at me and said I'll be alright Dad... and then he died. This only exists to prop up the cheesy end scene which should never have been included.

Michelle Rodriguez also played her role very well given the screen time she had. Though i felt they could have showed a little more of relationship between Lee Ray Liotta and Teresa Michelle Rodriguez. Overall this is a great movie to watch if your into drama's with a surprise ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thought the story of Tim Hunter's Controle about the reprogramming of a psychopath is intriguing this film displays one of the major Hollywood clich problems. What I am referring to is the fact that the first part of Controle is without any doubt the best part. This half is wellwritten sometimes visually attractive f.i. the flashback of Liotta's character shooting an innocent man followed by a cgi blood drop that falls down on his shoulder and by far the best acted 'phase' of the movie. This is also the slowest part of the film. The characters and their problems are set and displayed. I was impressed with Liotta's depiction of murderer Lee Ray who changes through the experimental drug Anagress from a killer to a nice relaxed and friendly person.In a way Dafoe is a miscast. Every scene seems like he's not acting his best and in the most fascinating scenes Liotta simply 'outguns' Dafoe's performance. He makes it look too much like a routine job. I remember he did the same thing in Paul Auster's Lulu on the Bridge 1998. Though he was splendid in Cronenberg's eXistenZ 1999.And now for the second part... The second half of Controle is what I referred to before as a Hollywood problem. The first half can be called a 'psychological dramathriller' the second part though tries to become a fastpaced 'action flick'. Which could have been great if the first part hadn't been so fascinating. It almost seems as though Hunter suddenly screams in the middle Ok guys let's take it to the bank!The idea of a medicine that would alter our behaviour isn't that refreshing but the way it is acted and depicted in the first part of the movie is fine. I must admit that I was moved by Liotta apologizing to his victim. That is the power of Liotta's acting in Controle he actually succeeds in making you feel sorry for him while you feel detested by the psycho he in the first few scenes.One thing the movie touches nicely though very Hollywoodesquire is the philosophy of 'second chance'. Lee Ray is handed a second chance after his death sentence and faked lethal injection. While dieing near the end of the film the flashbacks of his life are different from the ones he experiences in the beginning of the film during the lethal injection. He dies with guilt but also with a few new good memories of things he DID handle right.Overall Controle is because of the lacking second part a mediocre movie. A typical dimestore Hollywood production. But I cannot admit there are some very interesting ideas and performances in it.".

Perhaps the problem is that viewers do not understand what a sociopath is and how they differ from your run of the mill murderer.

It's also interesting to compare their crime and punishment state of affairs with DeKay's vengeful lowlife.

Marcus will do whatever he can to make his depressed mother happy even if it causes himself grief. As such he realizes that he is perceived as different than most kids as even the selfprofessed weird kids don't want to hang out with him as he is the target of bullying. Part of the taunts against him are the fact that he sings and speaks to himself without even realizing that he is doing it. Meanwhile thirtyeight year old Will Freeman is a slacker who has lived comfortably off the royalties of a song written by his deceased father and as such has never had to work a day in his life. He is a solitary man who places himself as the first and only priority in life. He comes across the idea that dating single moms meets his selfish carnal needs. It is in this capacity that Will meets Marcus as one of Will's single mother ...";

	schema:reviewBody "I think I smiled all the way through About a Boy' a comic nearmasterpiece derived from the bestselling novel by Nick Hornby.  For the sake of accuracy both the novel and the film should more rightly be titled About TWO Boys' since the story focuses not only on 12year old Marcus but on 38year old Will a man totally dedicated to the proposition that any man who so desires can live quite happily on his own private little urban island thank you very much.  Will's island' is his own London flat which he has equipped with all the accoutrements of comfort and diversion that modern technology  in the form of computers big screen TV's and DVD players  can afford.  Who needs people when you have so much stuff' to keep you content and occupied?  Will thrives in his environment much to the chagrin of his married couple friends who keep insisting that he must certainly be miserable without a wife and family to give his life meaning. But Will loves being shallow  a fact of his personality he is more than willing to declare right up front  and the last thing he needs  or thinks he needs  is people to clutter it up.  Yet island dwellers have a tendency not to remain marooned for long and before he knows it Will finds himself striking up a relationship with a lonely backward boy named Marcus whose mother suffers from serious bouts of suicidal depression.More than any comedy in recent memory About a Boy' establishes a tone and sticks with it to the end.  The screenplay by Peter Hedges Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz the latter two function as the film's directors as well manages to take a potentially clichd and predictable story and invest it with a warmth wit and tenderness that are allenveloping.  The voiceover narration by both Will and Marcus which introduces us to their characters and keeps us informed as to their mental progress throughout the film is remarkably clever and droll.  Yet the characters never come across as smug smartalecky or flippant.  Rather they speak and behave in ways that are both believable and realistic.  Hugh Grant gives his richest performance to date as Will the man who refuses to grow up and assume the role of responsible adult blithely unaware of the emotional depths that lie hidden under a surface of apathy and indifference.  The superb Grant is more than matched by relative newcomer Nicholas Hoult an extraordinarily gifted young actor who doesn't look like the average adorable' screen kid and who makes Marcus into a very real very likable and very sensitive young man.  The remainder of the large cast is outstanding as well.  Moreover the film is very astute in its observation about just how easy technology has made it for us to isolate ourselves from one another.  Admittedly a little of the sharpness does go out of the screenplay in its closing stretches but not enough to diminish one's pleasure appreciably.In many ways About a Boy' is a movie that needs to be experienced first hand since mere words fail to convey the very special charm and spell it manages to cast over the viewer.  Rush to see it.  Comic gems like this one don't come around very often!".

	schema:reviewBody "Being afforded a life of independent means can be a blessing in some regards perhaps but it can also be the definitive test of one's character. If one chooses to use such a situation toward altruistic ends or at the very least a venture that can provide some personal fulfillment it says something about who that person is.  On the other hand if one squanders the opportunity on a totally selfabsorbed shallow existence it says even more.  And while taking the latter path may provide some interesting moments it's a cosmetically created external bubble that serves no other purpose than covering up an empty life and sooner or later to anyone with even a modicum of intelligence that bubble is bound to burst and when it finally happens when the wakeup call comes how one responds to it is the ultimate test of character which is what happens to a such a man in About A Boy' directed by Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz and starring Hugh Grant.As far as Will Freeman Grant is concerned he has the perfect life he lives comfortably if not extravagantly on the income provided by a certain kind of inheritance.  On the surface at least he's happy.  Admittedly however he's the very epitome of shallow' who makes a conscious and concerted effort at avoiding any commitment in relationships or even attempting to accomplish or achieve anything at all.  He merely takes from life gives absolutely nothing back and has always been content with it. But of late his relationships have become a bit sticky.'  Women are becoming too demanding the breakups too messy.  He needs a new conquest a relationship in which he can flex his shallowness anew with a woman who will give him everything and demand nothing in return. Fortuitous circumstances provide him with just what he's looking for fortuitous however in a way he doesn't realize as it leads to a relationship through which he encounters a young boy Marcus Nicholas Hoult.  And it's a meeting that is destined to have an enormous impact on his life as Marcus becomes the catalyst that changes Will's entire perspective.  For the first time Will begins to question who he is and what he's doing or not doing with his life.Telling this story adapted for the screen by Peter Hedges and the Weitz brothers from the novel by Nick Hornby presented a challenge to the filmmakers in that it's nothing really new the history of the cinema is filled with stories of individual epiphanies many along the same lines as this one recently The Kid' with Bruce Willis for example.  So a fresh approach and presentation including the kind of performances they could extract from their actors was essential for this film to attain any distinction whatsoever.  Which it does and splendidly.  And moreover they succeed on all fronts.  The screenplay is intelligent and the characters especially Will and Marcus' mom Fiona Toni Collette are convincingly well developed.  With Will there is no sudden leap into who he becomes by the end of the film it comes though a gradual recognition and realization of who he is after first establishing a starting point from which the character can grow.  The same is true of Fiona.  There's detours and setbacks which as in real life prevent a direct journey from point A to point B and create the proverbial sticky wicket along the way.  Weitz and Weitz set a good pace and most importantly manage to give their film some real heart without lapsing into any melodramatic maudlin sentimentality. Rather the sentiments and situations they express are real and believable and presented in such a way as to afford the audience any number of elements to which they can genuinely relate.As Will Hugh Grant gives arguably his best performance ever.  In some respects Will is similar to other characters Grant has created most notably Daniel in Bridget Jones's Diary' but there's a depth to Will he's never previously managed to achieve and without question this is his most threedimensional fully developed character yet.  Grant has a natural charm and a charismatic screen presence but his presentation is often tinged with a bit of pretentiousness that is entirely absent here.  He does an especially nice job of effecting Will's transition in very real and credible terms and by the end it's obvious that this is a side of Grant we have not seen before with this role he has effectively expanded his range as an actor.  In the final analysis it's a performance with real substance and it makes Will a truly memorable character.The young Hoult brings Marcus convincingly to life as well with an extremely natural performance in which he commendably manages to avoid the trappings of stereotype into which this character could easily have fallen. Some credit must go to his directors of course but it's Hoult who makes it especially believable in the way he responds for instance to certain given situations that typically seem to evoke a particular reaction when being depicted on screen his rather introspective response to the taunts of his school mates for example quite different than what is usually portrayed in film.  And in their scenes together Grant and Hoult strike a chord of reality that finally assures the overall success of this film.The supporting cast includes Rachel Weisz Rachel Isabel Brook Angie Sharon Small Christine Victoria Smurfit Suzie and Nat Gastiain Tena Ellie.  Entertaining as well as insightful About A Boy' gives a truly fresh perspective to an element of the human condition that has been explored before but rarely as effectively.  The Weitz Brothers make the subject of their film accessible to a wide audience and in a way that is engaging and satisfying.  This film is going to be a pleasant surprise to many who see it in that it delivers a whole lot more than most would expect.  And that's the magic of the movies.  910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes a rut can feel like a hammock when we get stuck in one.About A Boy is about a Londoner who was apparently born into one imprisoned as it were by his father's legacy as author of one of the world's most popular and annoying Christmas songs. After years of feckless unemployed uppermiddleclass living Will views himself as an island and sees his lack of longterm relationships as a plus. Even offered the simple honor of being an infant's godfather Will begs off saying he'd be crap at it and probably just try and shag the girl the moment she turned 18.I always thought you had hidden depths the mother says.No you've always had that wrong Will cheerfully replies. I really am this shallow.But of course Will does have depths and as played by Hugh Grant in a role that gives this smooth comedic actor a chance to showcase some previouslyunguessedat depths of his own we find ourselves rooting for Will to find them as he finds himself attached unwillingly to a 12yearold named Marcus played with welcome noncuteness by Nicholas Hoult. Marcus an abuse magnet at school is alternately worried for his unstable mother and searching for a pal. Will a 12yearold at heart is a perfect if unknowing candidate.Based on the great Nick Hornby novel About A Boy walks a fine line doling out easy laughs and real pathos with deceptive ease. Like Hornby's book the movie depicts Will's perverse detachment from the world as both delightful and pathetic. Life is a full plate of pain for those who participate but the benefits as Marcus tries to tell Will beat all else.Of course most of us don't have the luxury for island living and the potential of resenting Will especially as played by that handsome devil Grant might have been the film's biggest danger. But Grant defuses things with a subtle characterization that downshifts on the smugness and draws on the lost boy within.For example when Will tries to infiltrate a singlemothers' club as a way of bagging some commitmentfree sex we watch him tell the mothers about his own nonexistent twoyearold boy Ned telling him you hang in there Dad then reacting with uncertain fear when the mothers enthuse about how remarkable that is for such a young child.But we also see the pain Will pretends isn't there in brief flashes as he reflects on the harddrinking failure his father became after his onehit wonder and especially in one great scene where Will finds himself with a woman he really cares about unable to break out of his artifice at a critical moment. During that scene and a later angry one with Marcus Grant's acting really demands consideration from those who dismiss him as a dandy glamor boy.The directors Chris and Paul Weitz of American Piefame prove they can make a film that delivers intelligence as well as laughter and with writer Peter Hedges fashion a script that takes some clever and daring liberties with Hornby's solid story. I especially liked the one near the end of the movie but if I revealed anything I'd probably get some Flack for it so say no more.The very last scene of the movie is a mistake though the kind of tidy resolution Hornby's novel and life itself rightly rejects. It's the one bum note in this film but enough of one to dock it a point with me. Otherwise I'd have to rate this above even the other cinematic Hornby adaptation the classic High Fidelity. But this is a very entertaining film with great set design a terrific Rubber Soulstyle Britpop title song by Badly Drawn Boy tight editing and subtle crafty camera work. Also some great supporting performances especially Toni Collette as Marcus' mother who has the film's toughest role she must be funny and suicidal and manages to not only pull it off but gives About A Boy a wonderfully unstable center. As About A Boy makes clear instability is a good thing when it shakes us from our ruts.".

	schema:headline " Hugh Grant shines great comingofage movie bloody hilarious and touching at the same time";
	schema:reviewBody "In the wonderfully entertaining About A Boy Hugh Grant shucks everything that made him famous nearly a decade earlier in Four Weddings and a Funeral the floppy hair the stuttering etc. and ends up giving his best performance to date. He plays Will a wealthy happily unemployed commitmentphobic cad slightly less insidious than Daniel Cleaver of Bridget Jones's Diary whose newest ploy is to date single mothers because they are easier to dump. However he meets Marcus Nicholas Hoult the son of a somewhat suicidal mother Toni Colette and realizes that he cannot continue living his life so shallowly.This film was based on Nick Hornby's wonderful book of the same name and retains much of the wit and touching humor. The early scenes depicting Will's full but spiritually empty life are particularly amusing with Will dividing the day up into units of time and spending these units on webbased research finding pics of supermodels with seethrough tops exercise shooting pool grooming and the like. Grant makes his character irresponsible but remains enormously likable throughout the film. This is important because we start to identify with him and understand his fears of commitment and helplessness behind his outward superficiality. His mannerismsGrant's specialty I thinkare v. entertaining to watch the selfishness hurt anger recognition and more pass across his face effortlessly. The other cast members Nicholas Hoult Toni Colette and Rachel Weisz  are also v. good in their supporting roles and play off each other well.The film doesn't follow the book too closely however but does oneup on the book by wisely emphasizing some parts that the book downplays. For example Rachel played by Rachel Weisz only appears for a few pages in the book but has much more presence in the movie. Through the Rachel character we see how Will's relationship with her is different from his past shallow ones and we realize that he is growing up. Also the movie is filled with great oneliners and sharp witty dialogue that never feels forced. The movie also employs voiceover function Will's very nicely for example in one serious scene Will follows the ambulance to the hospital looking rather serious but in his voiceover he says. It was all terrible just terrible. But driving fast behind the ambulance was fantastic. The character would never say that out loud but it provides comic relief and the assurance that he is indeed very shallow.The strength of About a Boy is in the simplicity and power of its scenes. Not one scene is wasted each one tells us a wealth about the characters and leads to Will's selfdiscovery. That along with Hugh Grant's delightful performance and backed by a great score from Badly Drawn Boy make About A Boy one of the most delightful entertaining and touching movies I've seen. It's a great feelgood movie. Highly recommended especially to Hugh Grant fans or anyone who has ever empathized or sympathized with Will and his situation. One of my favorites. 1010.".

The other cast members Nicholas Hoult Toni Colette and Rachel Weisz  are also v. good in their supporting roles and play off each other well.The film doesn't follow the book too closely however but does oneup on the book by wisely emphasizing some parts that the book downplays. For example Rachel played by Rachel Weisz only appears for a few pages in the book but has much more presence in the movie. Through the Rachel character we see how Will's relationship with her is different from his past shallow ones and we realize that he is growing up. Also the movie is filled with great oneliners and sharp witty dialogue that never feels forced. The movie also employs voiceover function Will's very nicely for example in one serious scene Will follows the ambulance to the hospital looking rather serious but in his voiceover he says. It was all terrible just terrible. But driving fast behind the ambulance was fantastic. The character would never say that out loud but it provides comic relief and the assurance that he is indeed very shallow.The strength of About a Boy is in the simplicity and power of its scenes. Not one scene is wasted each one tells us a wealth about the characters and leads to Will's selfdiscovery. That along with Hugh Grant's delightful performance and backed by a great score from Badly Drawn Boy make About A Boy one of the most delightful entertaining and touching movies I've seen. It's a great feelgood movie. Highly recommended especially to Hugh Grant fans or anyone who has ever empathized or sympathized with Will and his situation. One of my favorites. 1010.";

I had read the book shortly before I saw it and when I heard Hugh Grant was going to star and the Weitz brothers were chosen to direct I didn't exactly have high hopes. I thought American Pie was funny and all but this kind of story demanded someone more mature someone clever. This movie however turned out to be all that mature clever witty sensible honest and most of all really funny in such a natural way. Hugh Grant has never been better in any role before or since and the soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy is just perfect for the movie. The only thing they overdid a little was Toni Collette's character. I've never seen a person like that in real life. What I did like was the way they changed the ending for the movie. Usually that's not a good idea but it totally worked here. After all I still liked High Fidelity a tiny bit better the movie not the book but About A Boy comes very close. If you are just as much a fan of this bookmovie as I am get the DVD. There are wonderful deleted scenes on it which are as funny as the rest of the movie.".

	schema:headline " Hugh Grant in nonannoying role shock! And he's quite funny too";
	schema:reviewBody "About a Boy' was being touted as a great make over for Hugh Grant and it is. Gone is his infamous bumbling English fop role his fluffy hair lost to a sharp more stylish cut. Here he plays a rich selfish layabout Will who cruises through life on the royalties from a song his deceased father penned years ago. He finds a great way to meet women who don't want to get involved through a single mother's group  which is where he meets the strange twelve year old boy Marcus Nicholas Hoult who lives with his depressed suicidal mother Fiona Toni Collette. A tragic event sees Marcus seeking comfort with the indifferent Will who begins to realise that there's more to life than sitting around at home all day.Hugh Grant is on peak form here  he sheds his old roles for that of a fresher younger man. He is able to convey charm and selfishness not just through words but also through his mannerisms. He even conveys genuine affable warmth later on in the movie without making my teeth grate Equally impressive is Toni Collette as Marcus' sad mother. Her character has a tragic feeling to it a real sense of worldweariness conveyed in a great combination of makeup and acting. The real star of the movie  for me is Nicholas Hoult as the young boy who helps Will come to realizations about his life. He doesn't get by on cute good looks like far too many kid actors because he can actually act  from the innocence of a child when he tries to get his mother and Will together to the simplistic musings of children who can't understand why some people hurt such as his mother. Like Osment whom he amusing compares himself to Hoult shows that child actors are just as if not more so capable as their elders.The script of the movie is witty without being outright hilarious. It's what you come to expect of the British comedy market the weak Ali G indahouse' aside. It being a British comedy you can predict where it's going to go and there are relatively few surprises along the way. Having said that the characters are sketched strongly enough and the humour at a high enough level that you'll be more than entertained along the way.It's surprising to see that this movie was directed by the American Pie' Weitz brothers because they bring a thoughtful contemplative air to the movie while never getting bogged down in pointless camera techniques  the most we're left with is some simple screen wipes. They've also chosen well by having Badly Drawn Boy compose the whole soundtrack as it works very well with the film's tone.There's nothing outstanding in About a Boy' but what's here is done surprisingly well. It's a nice movie that's quite enjoyable for relaxing to some evening. A 710 seems just.".

At first he sees himself helping his mum by getting Will to like her but gradually Marcus and Will get used to each other and have lessons that both can learn.Following the steaming success of High Fidelity another Hornby book makes the transition.  However credit should be given for setting the movie in England and not moving it somewhere else cooler.  This however is probably due to the lead being English and very bankable!The story is of course about blokes.and blokes problems  this is Hornby after all.  The plot is simple but the fact that it done with a great deal of wit makes it come across very easily.  Occasionally the mix of heavy subjects Marcus's home life with the comedy of Will's life is a little uneasy but after a while it mixes better.  The story is pretty revealing  I can see a lot of myself in Will as many men will and it is involving then to see Marcus teach him things about life.  However saying that the best thing about this is the comedy  when Will is involved it is nearly always laugh out loud funny  and that's most of the time.The directors deal with this film really well  they focus on Grants strengths and also use several really cool visual things to add to the comedy  like quick cuts and freeze frame  but not to the point of annoyance.  Surprising that these guys did American Pie! Not the most subtle or clever of comediesGrant is excellent here  he easily handles the emotional side of the film and the comedy but it's in the comedy he excels.  His face plays out as many jokes as his words and he is indeed a master at playing this character. However here he has to work harder than when he does his usual Englishfop' stuff because Will is selfish and not immediately likeable..I must admit that at the start I struggled to get into the film because I hate these people who spend their time in Notting Hill cafes living off inheritances etc  so it's a credit to Grant that he carries it off.  Hoult is not as good  he has too much weight to carry.  Hoult has to manage the whole emotional side of the film and at times he can't convince. Collette is good as Fiona but again suffers from not having any of the comedy side of the film.  Rachel Weisz was good in a small role but as far as I'm concerned  if she was making this then she wasn't making another rubbish Mummy film!Overall this is a successful adaptation of the book.  The emotional side and the comedy at times don't sit well together and at times it all feels very lightweight but ultimately it all comes together.  Grant is excellent and excels himself here  when he's on screen the film is hilarious and moves fluidly.  Unfortunately it slightly highlights the weaknesses of those around him.".

	schema:reviewBody "About a Boy is a heartwarming comedy film starring Hugh Grant and introducing Nicholas Hoult. The film tells a tale of the unlikely connection between a 30something man who's got it all without ever having done a hard days work in his life and thinks of himself as an 'island' and a peculiar 12 year old boy who struggles at the mercy of bullies and his depressed mother. Whilst this may seem like an unlikely duo Grant and Hoult manage to pull it off perfectly. The film is well scripted making sure that it delivers comedy and seriousness at a good level without one overbalancing the other and without ruining the book written by Nick Hornby of which this film was based off of. As well as top performances from Hugh Grant Nicholas Hoult Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz the film also contains excellent music performed by Badly Drawn Boy. The music used in the film further enhances the scenes and emotions that are being conveyed. The main message in the film is to further prove a famous quote from Jon Bon Jovi stating that No man is an island.. We learn from watching the characters themselves especially Will how true this quote is and the importance of having others in your life. I've seen this film countless times and each and every time I find that I'm smiling at the end. While it may not be perfect it's certainly one of Hugh Grant's best performance and provides a heartwarming message.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Weitz brothers of 'American Pie' fame surprised me with this intelligent comedy. They do a commendable job of bringing Nick Hornby's modern British comedy to screen. Peter Hedges takes up the challenge to adapt Hornby's novel and he does a fine job. I liked that it wasn't Americanized. The quirkiness and humour is well balanced witty and clever while amusing. The film is mainly about growth of the characters especially Will Fiona and Marcus and I loved how it was portrayed in a gradually subtle way. The situations are easy to relate to. Even though the characters live under unusual circumstances like Will choosing not to work because he does not need to the suicidal Fiona or Marcus regularly visiting Will in order to fix him up with his mom they are easy to identify with. Hugh Grant is great as the shallow Will. He's cast against type and this is perhaps the role that allows him to stretch his acting further. Nicholas Hoult delivers a natural performance. He's certainly not those movie kids who are made to look cute because the director can't get them to act so credit does go to the Weitzs. Toni Collette is superb as always. Rachel Weisz makes the best of a small role. The rest of the cast do a good enough job. The soundtrack is gentle and whimsical at times flowing smoothly with the steady pace. I liked the songs of Badly Drawn Boy. Some of the deleted scenes on the DVD are worth a watch. In a nutshell 'About A Boy' is a simple delightful and funny movie about growing up.".

	schema:reviewBody "About a Boy is a charming Comedy and a little romance which shows a sweet story played out excellently. With some great acting from the best when it comes to this type of movie and also many great contributing factors this is one big film which really is excellent. The script is tight direction superb and even the setting is good too make this in my opinion a just about great film and one that even has room to grow.The story is one that can touch the heart yet also find your funny bone and by the end you should feel well very pleasant. It is well timed all the way through and when the romantic areas are explored it holds it's ground making this better than the majority of Romcoms out there. I felt it could have been maybe slightly more laugh out loud but in any case it makes you giggle.Hugh Grant is excellent in the lead role and his relationship with Nicholas Holt is one to be savoured for the future generation of film lovers. Going on to Holt well his talent is plainly seen not the best actor here but his work with Grant makes both of them shine so much that awards could have been won big time. People like Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz pitch in perfectly and they don't go understated when your done here.Many say this is one film which eclipses it's novel that it's based on and you can see why with such a strong script adapted beautifully and given so much rich depth that you finish the movie feeling you've seen the best of British cinema. I think Chris and Paul Weitz do a good job in directing and are part of the reason why Grant and Holt work so well the two seem to be able to mould them to each other and get the best out of them.I think the main negativity comes from well very little yes it lacks substantial comedy but then again when are many films like this crying with laughter affairs. I felt Nicholas Holt can be pooryes I know he's a child actor I just felt he can seem to much like he is being directed and not portraying his true quality as an actor but other than that very little is wrong with the film.If you like good old romps and a fun old adventure then this is for you as it really spans over a good year to show you truly everything about each main characters life. If your looking to be heart wrenched well I don't think it will make you cry but no doubt it has it's sadder moment but in any case tissues should not be needed whilst viewing.Overall I think it was Just About an excellent comedy and one that will be remembered for a long time. The chemistry of the leads is truly the stand out point from this movie and without not just the characters but the two actors this would have been greatly at a disadvantage. Love it or hate it and it be slightly soppy this movie is sure to have some feeling warm and fuzzy but I accept some others will feel slightly more not annoyed but maybe cheesy seeing as the majority of this movie is very one liner orientated but they all come out well.".

It's very rare now for a movie to be this funny and at the same time be just as touching too. You actually care for the characters in this movie and the ending is satisfying. Hugh Grant is great as Will and it is definitely his best performance. Also About A Boy just wouldn't be the same without the soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy. It's disappointing that not a lot of people went to see it in theatres since it was in almost direct competition with spiderman and star wars but now that it's on video do not pass up the chance to see it. I regret I didn't see it sooner. My Rating 1010".

It's very rare now for a movie to be this funny and at the same time be just as touching too. You actually care for the characters in this movie and the ending is satisfying. Hugh Grant is great as Will and it is definitely his best performance. Also About A Boy just wouldn't be the same without the soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy. It's disappointing that not a lot of people went to see it in theatres since it was in almost direct competition with spiderman and star wars but now that it's on video do not pass up the chance to see it. I regret I didn't see it sooner. My Rating 1010";

	schema:reviewBody "Make The Yuletide Gay is a wonderful film that I would recommend to far more than LGBTQ audiences. It is to be fondly hoped that more and more gay youth experience what the leads Keith Jordan and Adam Ruggiero at Christmas time.Jordan plays an out and proud college student and Ruggiero is his boyfriend. Except for one thing neither has come out to parents. Their concerns are quite real. In my own life I've met too many gay people who were disowned by families and had some terrible life experiences stemming from that.Jordan is heading home to his Wisconsin family and Ruggiero was going to go home but his parents Ian Buchanan and Gates McFadden are busy in their social world and have just won a cruise for two. So left on his own devices Ruggiero comes to Jordan's and the two have to figure out where their relationship is going.Jordan's parents are an interesting pair. Derek Long was a Grateful Dead fanatic in his youth now he seems like someone who's just retreated from life. Kelly Keaton is in her own world and appears totally clueless about all around her.Without going into too much detail let's say it's Merry Christmas to all. For a gay themed movie this thing is practically Grated. Sad to say that the sight of two attractive young men showing passionate care for each other is still likely to earn a restricted rating. Really there's nothing hereeven the youngest audiences could see it and not be 'damaged' for life. But just the subject of same gender sex is enough to get the Puritan in some going.I would recommend this as a model film for PFLAG to show how some parents really do care for their children first no matter what their sexual orientation may be.".

Gunn's mother is a scene stealer on many occasions.

It's humorous yet delicate and touching when needed.The jokes are mostly sharp and effective. A few of the gay jokes feel a little forced at times almost obligatory but this is picking for holes and easily forgiven.This film is a celebration.

	schema:reviewBody "A sweet or really fabulous film on coming out not in the world which is college for the two boys That was done a long time ago and everyone knows about it but in their families. On one side Olaf has to reveal his parents he is gay on the other side Nathan has to reveal his family he has a boy friend. Both are hard both situations and probably both boys too. One has to be done face to face. The other has to be done on an answering machine that will only be listened to three weeks later.But the film is not only fabulous because of these last five minutes but because all along it is innuendo upon innuendo and it never ends. We believe up to those last five minutes that it is pure innocence if not simplemindedness on Olaf's parents' side but it is true there is some humour when people who play straight 100 start telling you that If you put enough meat in a man's mouth he is happy. And there is also some humour when the two boys confronted with sharing the same room and bunk beds the one like the other both pretend that they both like to be on top and the poor mother does not seem to catch the very direct meaning.The best part is not about the film. It is about the quotes from this film given by cinema sites I have not found one single of these funny remarks that are funny because of their doubleentendre. Why on earth are some people shy about it even when it does not concern them directly? I wonder. That is not modesty at all but guilt somewhere and probably rejection.The film is probably not going to revolutionize our way of looking at gay people coming out of the famous closet and it is probably not that simple and easy to do. But it is a funny film that reveals how two men can really love each other just because they love each other and there is no explanation for love. It is just beautiful and hot indeed burning hot. All you need is love! Quoted in the film.And even if it is true we are always amazed how well most people are able to accept love no matter what kind of love it is because there are always a few who will become brutal and aggressive just for the fun and the anger of blowing up a gay man.I cannot understand why so many people can only see that love can only be straight whereas love can be mental artistic musical sentimental passionate gay straight or LGBT. And there is no obligation for that love to be hormonal at all. We can we must we should love many people for all types of reason and in all types of way each form of love reinforcing all other forms. Just loving another person is the most beautiful thing in the world and the phenomenal transformation it operates in one's mind and way of looking at the world is a good enough reason to accept and even worship every and any form of love.And a love affair can always be carried out to its acme between two sheets of paper in a book or two prints from the 18th century or two blankets of silky thinking on the latest physical discovery about how protons neutrinos electrons and so many other photons can spend their whole life chasing one another and yet never meeting and having any kind of a direct physical encounter.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU".

	schema:reviewBody "Due to my own notsogood experiences with my comingout thanks mum and dad!! I'm a real sucker for feelgood comingout movies  they never fail to bring me to some heartfelt tears of shared happiness. So with these kind of movies I'm not that critical as to whether the script the direction or the acting is really above par. That's a good thing with this movie for it's rather balancing on the verge. Although I enjoyed it and it served it's purpose there are many flaws.For starters there seem to have been made some strange and awkward choices in the editing. At many many points the movie comes to a standstill when the camera lingers far too long on the face of a person after he or she has said or done something. When you want to stress some Deap Meaning this can be quite functional but in a comedy or at least at moments when comedy is intended it's killing it not only effects the pace but it sucks the punch outoff every punchline! This brings me to my next reservation there are way too many double entendres in the script it dangerously tilts the movie to the point of belowthebelt cheapness. Sure I laughed at some of them even at the beaverjoke but it annoyed me too this movie didn't need all that since it's a situational comedy the fun should come out of the situation itself and the opposite characters.Another reservation concerns the sidecharacters and thus again the script. When you have so few characters in the story in fact there are only four important ones apart from the girl next door and two of them both parents are personified and pictured in such an extreme and surreal way then in my opinion it becomes totally topheavy and negatively affects the balance of the story. One lunatic parent with maybe one or two lunatic neighbors would had been quite enough.A last negative remark to the script although it's a comedy there ought to be maintained  especially in this kind of situational comedy  some sort of basic feeling of reality. Here this was put to the test way too often. Can a renowned professor walk around for a whole professional career being perpetually stoned out of his wits? Are these parents obviously from the 60's lovegeneration blind as bats not to see that their son's roommate Nathan is gayer than gay?! Is the switch of the neighborgirl from lovesick goody twoshoes to an almost professional foulmouthing faghag not a tiny bit too abrupt and weird?? And is the almost utopian coolness of both parents at the eventual outing of their son not a tiny bit outof sync with the beforehand constant hammering of at least mama with her son on the theme of girls marriage family etc.? Wouldn't such cool and unorthodox parents who make out with each other almost publicly have such loud sex that their son has to put a pillow over his head and with a father who walks around the house with his morninggown hanging open and in that state even opens the front door when a stranger calls  wouldn't such cool and carefree parents have already brought up the topic of sex with their only son a long time ago?? Well anyway now for the good things. This is without any doubt a very sympathetic warm and sincere movie. There is thank god not so much a Big Message that has to be drilledin it just keeps close to the reallife fears of a gay adolescent when being on the brink of revealing his true self to his family will they accept me in this new light? will I disappoint them? will things change between us? The script doesn't provide a big plot  like in so many other comparable comingofage movies  with complicated misunderstandings plotshifts and all kinds of sidestories no it just sort of strolls along on it's basic theme and in this way gets a nice and quiet development. The comedyelements are as said not of the most subtle kind but in spite of the serious theme the lighthearted tone of the movie succeeds in making you smile all the time and that is not a bad thing. The characters of the parents are unrealistic and overthetop so it must have been hard for the actors to make something out of it but I have to give credit to Kelly Keaton who gives within the limits and pitfalls of the script a very good enthusiastic and affectionate performance. The main characters are of course Olav and Nathan both are given a fine and convincing portrayal by Keith Jordan resp. Adamo Ruggiero. I didn't know Ruggiero I never saw Degrassi he's certainly beautiful and very cute and I thought that he grew in his role he was supposed to be the gayish extrovert of the two boyfriends but he proved that within that stereotype he could actually find his own nuances  for instance when father Gunnunderson finds him all alone on a sidewalk terrace Ruggiero really succeeds in moving you. But I especially liked Keith Jordan he had this subdued undercooled as we say in Holland way of acting that only enhanced the feeling of reality and he is so cute and endearing in his seriousness that it made me want to put his head on my shoulder and tell him that eventually everything would be okay!All in all the good things far outweighed the bad and I vote it a heartfelt 8 out of 10!".

	schema:headline " A Film That Tests How Many Double Entendres You Can Fit in One Screenplay";
	schema:reviewBody "Writer  Director Rob Williams has created a pleasant and funny independent small budget film that features a standout performance by Keith Jordan as Olaf 'Gunn' Gunnunderson the main character who is a gay student leader at college but stuck in the closet with his Midwestern family. Christmas time is the setting for a sometimes hilarious and touching coming out story.Jordan reaches a genuine honesty in every scene and considering how fast the shooting schedule is for these low budget features this is the mark of genuine talent. Jordan's performance is the heart and core of the film and keeps it grounded despite the screenplay by Rob Williams that is filled to the brim with sexual double entendres. However through the miracle of Jordan's pitch perfect performance no matter how many references there are to tops bottoms muffins and penis size the film stays on course.Support for Jordan's acting comes from Austin Wintory's lowkey folksy songs and soundtrack that provides a grounded tone to each scene and from a great supporting role by Hallee Hirsh who plays Jordan's exhigh school sweetheart. For Star Trek The Next Generation fans Gates Beverly Crusher McFadden has a brief but important role that is the catalyst for mayhem as the mother of Olaf's boyfriend Nathan Stanford played by Adamo Ruggiero who abandons Nathan at Christmas forcing him to seek refuge at his boyfriend's home  thereby creating the pressure on Olaf to come out to his parents.Make the Yueltide Gay was a surprisingly entertaining late night film downloaded from Neflix that held my attention. If you keep your expectations at the level of a campy low budget film I think you will be pleasantly surprised. I recommend this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a fan of Adamo Ruggiero since his earliest Degrassi days and I really wanted to like this film. Unfortunately it was so poorly made that I can never recommend it to any of my friends. The film just couldn't seem to get out of it's own way.The parents and the neighbors were more caricatures than characters. In fact they would have had to have been toned down considerably to have been reasonable caricatures.The dialogue was good in spots but then seemed to immediately slip off the rails. The dialogue jokes were forced at best and often groanworthy. If half of them had been removed the story might have been able to carry them but as it was they were just too much. Just as there always seemed too be one syllable too much in the name Gununderson the lines always seemed to go a bit too far.Actually the main characters Olaf and Nathan were OK and both actors were adorable and able to make me care about their characters. However the mother's character was just too far over the top and the father was beyond beyond. I've seen Derek Long in one of this director's earlier works and he was MUCH better in that I'm not saying that the actors didn't do a great job with what they were given but this film could have really used at least one more script revision before it was shot. I've often railed about the lack of perspective that occurs when the writer is also the director and this film is just another example of that problem.Just one example should suffice but this does contain a spoiler so be forewarned When Nathan returns to the Gununderson's house after claiming that he's going to fly home. The audience is concerned with what Olaf will think and do. Will he welcome Nathan back? Will he finally be honest with his parents? Instead we're given a meaningless joke about headless gingerbread men. The joke was entirely unnecessary and then it isn't even executed correctly as Nathan lifts a normal gingerbread man from a plate that has just been shown to contain only headless ones.Overall I really wanted to like this movie and it wasn't as painful as a few gay films that I've been unable to sit through but it was clearly pushing that limit.".

	schema:headline " Merry awkward Christmas and have a gay new year!";
	schema:reviewBody "Actually I was hoping it would be something along the lines of Home for the Holidays you know big family of goof balls in midst the already insane holiday crazy only with the focus being the gay son. Make the Yuletide gay is anything but that. No holiday antics no pestering relatives in the end it's just a comingoutstory. Which isn't a bad thing at all of course but... OK one step after another.The first thing we learn about the main character Gun actually Gustav  his family is Swedish methinks is that he's one hot dude known in his college as the Big Gun. Who tells us this? His philosophy professor! Who sort of hits on Gun after he has finished his last exam of the year. Whose also a pretty hot dude himself because we all know how sexy philosophy profs are. OK I was already prepared to hate that movie. So in comes Gun's boyfriend Nathan. Or should I rather say flies in? Like a fairy? Throughout their first romantic scene together where they exchange gifts well not exactly exchange  Nathan bought one for Gun and for himself and makes Gun give it to him hahaha. How sweet. my eyes were rolling as if they'd try to screw themselves out of my head.Anyway Gun is going to stay at his parents over Christmas holiday BUT he isn't out to them yet. Nathan was originally supposed to stay at his parents but they won a Christmas cruise and decide to simply leave their son on his own over the holidays. So Nathan decides to stay with Gun's family. Much to the dismay of Gun because he never told his boyfriend that his parents think he's straight. This of course is when things get more interesting funny and occasionally even touching in an understated way.Now Gun's parents are two very special people. At first I thought his father had Altzheimer because he constantly forgets things and mutters random nonsense but it turns out he's just a weed head. A hardcore weed head. He hasn't a single scene where he's sober. Apparently Gun's mother isn't doing drugs but then again... she's always giggling always cracking weird jokes and I swear in one scene where Nathan's just in his underwear she drops on her knees to take a closer look at Nathan's panties because there are monkeys on it! I can't believe she's sober! Well OK maybe kissing a guy who smokes weed 247 makes you stoned too I don't know. Most scenes with those two turn out to be more awkward than funny with many pauses and the camera lingers on them for far too long after they said anything substantial adding to the already awkward atmosphere.Then there's also Abby the girl next door and mom's first choice for Gun's bride. Abby seems to be a nice harmless obnoxiously sweet girl at first but as soon as she meets Nathan she immediately finds out the two guys are gay and snap out of the blue turns into a freakish Paris Hiltonstyle fag hag calling them bitches and all of that hilarious stuff. It's painful to watch. And finally there's Abby's mother who is... just some obnoxious snob who has a feud with Gun's mother and has no real relevance to anything.Well with the side characters out of the way I'll finally get to the part that actually made the movie worthwhile. Our two heroes of course. It's undeniable there is a good chemistry going on between these two. They're also by far the best actors in the movie. Keith Jordan as Gun does a good job conveying that irrational fear that makes it so hard for him to come out to his parents. He doesn't want to lose their love because he's afraid that they might be not as liberal as they appear on the outside. That's a feeling a lot of homosexuals either men or women can relate to. His portrayal of this struggle within him is lowkey and thus more convincing. But to my surprise it's Adamo Ruggiero as Nathan who is most interesting. Turns out he isn't the queen I figured him out to be. In the end he's by far the more mature of the two men though he also has his fears and problems i.e. his cold unloving parents. It was fun to watch him as he watched Gun and his family in disbelief and actually touching when he gradually started to compare this family to his own. You can actually see how this feeling of loneliness unfolds in him.It's the moments the film spends exclusively on these two that made it worthwhile for me. And in a romantic comedy that's what counts the most.I didn't go much into the plot because frankly there isn't one to speak of. It's more like an observation of this family's Christmas holidays with Gun's struggle as the red thread. I give the film credit for trying. Director Rob Williams captured that everyday feeling quite well and the movie never gets boring the message is clear but not forced on you with schmaltz and although I didn't like any of the side characters they're quite original. And it's humor is OK too  if you like humor that almost entirely consists of double entendre. I swear they crammed every sexual innuendo into this movie the setting has to offer. Like loftbeds Swedish sausages and... beavers? OK I'm not so sure about this. Are beavers actually standard decoration in America on Christmas!? Well as you can see it's quite lowbrow humor but it usually came so unexpected that I found it genuinely funny.All in all you won't lose anything from watching this movie. And especially with the holidays approaching it's a nice way to spend an evening with your sweetheart. And I think I learned some lessons on tolerance myself as well.".

It should have at least some emotional depth. And I did not even get a very 'okay' feeling from its condescending attitude. I mean a movie can have low production value and storywithoutsurprise and still produce empathy for the characters. take latter days for example. but the storyline has to be developed properly and credibly.they fail to come up even with a decent crisis.a problem does occur but there is no real buildingup OR resolving. This one also wins the award for holding the highest amount of familiar sexual innuendos. but my insides are cramped with all the cringes resulting from very bad delivery. There are so many notsobad lighthearted movies about young people coming out to the family... Mambo Italiano and Touch of Pink for example.

	schema:headline " More than A Man and His Dog film";
	schema:reviewBody "After reading some of the outlandish bad reviews I had to comment on this film. I know people's perceptions differ but some of the bad reviews are so exaggerated and are lack of a better word incorrect! I was hesitant about going to see just another generic man and dog film. It was my girlfriend's idea and I figured it would be another corny chick flick about how a couple get a dog and how it brings them together. After I began watching it grabbed my attention and never let go! I don't think my review of this film will be able to capture the true essence and emotions this film captures but here goes The film was very gripping in its realistic portrayal of the development of a family and their pet from the couple's wedding until the film's end approximately 40 years into their lives. I think for most people the couple's relationship and even a troublesome pet will seem familiarimperfect but yet believable. The movie isn't solely about the dog but how the dog is a bit of a nuisance at first but matures along with the family. Giving many more details may ruin the story so I'll hit some of the points that need attention.Some people argue that this film lacks comedy but it's subtle comedythe type real life offers...nothing exaggerated and unbelievable...like too many Seth Rogan films. Owen Wilson is more toned down but he adds his spin to a more downtoearth role as a husband that chooses his life as a husband over the dream life he had pictured. Aniston delivers one of her best performances in my opinion. I'm not a big fan of her acting but she gives an undeniably good performance as Wilson's adoring wife.Regarding the nudity and sex yes they hint at having sex but nothing is shown nor sounds like sex. There is NO NUDITY!!! There is a shot of Aniston's naked BACKnot her backside her back. All of the film's sexual innuendos are while they are married! If anything I think this sends a positive message to younger viewers that this is the way it's supposed to be...fun isn't over after marriage and in some cases it's when the real adventure begins. Children these days have seen worse than this film shows on network TV and MTV. I didn't hear any bad language that isn't on TV already. It wasn't what most people consider the worst words. And lastly the sad part of the film is realistic not morbid murder or uncalled for...sometimes I think people are so used to films like The Dark Knight that when they see a wholesome realistic film they're disappointed because they're wanting something epic.Give this film and chance and realize going into it that it's not the mindless idealistic comedy that Hollywood has stuffed down our throats lately. It's heartwarming wholesome and true to life.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly Good";
	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw the previews for Marley and Me I thought ugh another desperate attempt by Jennifer Aniston to resuscitate her career. I used to be a huge Aniston fan back in the Friends days but it's been years since I've seen any of her movies. And as for Owen Wilson he always seemed like a goof who rode on the wave of his older brother's success. This movie proved me wrong on both counts.Marley and Me is about a dog definitely but it's just as much about a man John Grogan played by Wilson his wife Jenny played by Aniston and his growing family. The film follows John from his wedding night to the peak of his journalism career a dozen years later years that are chronicled in his weekly columns for a Florida newspaper. Marley the lovable but horribly destructive yellow lab enters his life as a puppy in an attempt to prepare him and his wife for future children. The dog as expected tears apart the house makes wild escapes humps the dog trainer and lovably terrorizes other people. But the film effectively intersperses those episodes with tender sincere moments of humandog bonding. Marley is there to comfort Jenny when her husband cannot adjusts to the children as they grow older and intrudes on the family's most private moments. He is a constant and at times annoying presence but Marley underscores the emotional tone of the film without dominating it.Similarly both Wilson and Aniston deliver understated performances that convey the upsanddowns of any marriage. While it is the bond between John and Marley that the film explores most deeply Jenny provides the link between dog family and children. In the end she realizes what Marley has become and what he has always been to the two of them. The film's overall tone  light humorous but at times very real  builds up to an ending that is surprisingly moving. Marley and Me is a tenderhearted easygoing film that will appeal to any doglover. But it will also I think appeal to anyone who can look back on his or her life and trace a common thread through each passing year. A beloved pet like Marley has that unique capability. I wish I could thank my own dog for that. But as one of the children in the movie tearfully says I'm sure he already knows.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every year I go to see a movie on Christmas Day. It's been a tradition since high school. This year's Christmas movie was Marley  Me. I was more excited by the fact that it was something that everyone could go and see including my mom who doesn't venture out to the theater very often. Anyway I was happy that she and my girlfriend were excited to see this.As I am sure many posters will repeat this phrase if you've ever been a dog owner this movie really rings true. The movie itself is very simple it chronicles the growth of a couple and the impact their pet Labrador has on their family throughout their life. It is really the simplicity that makes the story work so well. This isn't Old Yeller or Lassie though some elements are there. This isn't a dog movie focused on the relationship of the canine and a kid a la My Dog Skip. This is a true depiction of what it is like for most people to get a puppy early in their relationship and how it can develop into them becoming a member of the family.There aren't many people in the cast. Jennifer Aniston really does the best job in the picture. I'm a fan of Owen Wilson I know many aren't and it was nice to see a serious side since we really hadn't seen one since Behind Enemy Lines. He did a good job but he really would've sold me if he had shed some full on tears when it was required. But he was very believable nonetheless.The film really humanizes the characters and their relationship with Marley with such realism. I haven't had a chance to read the book but I have a feeling the movie captured the essence of the story. I have been a dog owner my entire life. I had 5 from childhood through college and have experienced the beginning act of the movie having purchased a puppy with my girlfriend 2 years ago. He is now a 2 yr old member of our family and we would be devastated if we ever lost him. Most can relate to the experience of being a pet owner and even if you can't there are messages here you can still connect with. I definitely recommend this for ANYBODY but try to take the family. If you never wanted a pet before I challenge you to not change your mind after viewing this. And yes men women and children alike were sobbing by the end".

	schema:reviewBody "Though I wasn't quite sure what to expect with Marley and Me I admit I basically expected it to be a slightly goofy slapstick type comedy centered around a highstrung pooch. I was thinking Beethoven just replace the St. Bernard with a Labrador.With Alist players like Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson involved however I should have known better.This is an actual movie  a real story about real life and the dog that runs through it literally and figuratively.The basic story follows Wilson and Aniston as journalists who embark upon their lives as a married couple. Marley comes early on as the puppy no one wants and the marginally insane highstrung pooch who appears throughout to be virtually untrainable don't tell that to that It's Me or the Dog gal. Shredding cushions destroying floors and walls and most everything in between seems to never quite drive them completely mad. Instead of taking him to the pound they soldier through and love their dog and of course he faithfully loves them in return. Like a child a pet is not someone you just give up on because they are hard to take care of.Children  three ultimately  come into their lives and John's Wilson career continues to advance as he carves a niche as a local columnist. They ultimately move from Florida to Pennsylvania. Even as the marriage has its ups and downs as Jen Aniston sans a character name change gives up her career to be a mom as kids are born and grow older as John struggles with his own career direction Marley remains the constant always a little crazy always infusing his peculiar personality into the family dynamic.This is a family movie in the truest sense  that is that it is about family about the reality of being a father a husband a wife a mother and the obligations and dreams and ambitions we have and often let go for the sake of the greater purpose of raising our children. It is about uncomfortable and often painful sacrifices of our own vision of the future for ourselves and our family. It is about what we give up to ultimately gain far more.Marley in his own way represents that sacrifice  a pet probably not many would take on and keep and engenders a huge challenge to persist in loving and caring for. Therein is a lesson in how to raise kids and how to love each other even when we don't much feel like it.For all its fine thoughtful and charming qualities Marley and Me is not 100 a family movie  there's some swearing not much  perhaps 5 or 6 times all relatively tame and some sexual innuendo but nothing overt. In the end I think it finds a pretty reasonable balance between trying to be a movie that appeals to adults and yet it doesn't kowtow to children either. The dialog and the acting are excellent Jennifer Aniston is especially good and whatever Owen does is understated and funny yet he also does serious when he needs to.In any case this is a fine movie that most adults will enjoy for a real characterdriven dramedy mostly drama less comedy and kids say 7 and older will be able to catch most of the finer elements of the script.".

	schema:reviewBody "Adapted from John Grogan's debut bestselling book Marley  Me is a painfully realistic portrayal of life and death as seen through the relationship of a young writer John Grogan Owen Wilson and his loyal Labrador retriever companion Marley.Shortly after the honeymoon phase has passed John and Jennifer Grogan Jennifer Aniston decide to fill a void in their lives or so they think. However life derails their plains. To help fill the void John and Jennifer decide to start their family with a cute and energetic puppy named Marley. The mischievous Marley chronicles the life career and marriage of John Grogan.The dynamics of the relationship between John and Jennifer is also remarkable. Had Marley not been such an integral part of the Grogan family their relationship may not have survived. Sebastian Eric Dane John Grogan's best human friend is the classical antithesis and a reminder of the freedoms of bachelorhood. Not until the chance encounter with Sebastian in Philadelphia do we see the completeness John has in his life with Jennifer the kids and Marley.A simple story coupled with a superb cast make Marley  Me a must see. Wilson's portrayal of Grogan is a welcome change from the often silly and one dimensional characters Wilson has become known for. Equally compelling is the character Jennifer Grogan Jennifer Aniston. At times it is often indistinguishable between the character Jennifer Grogan and the person Jennifer Aniston. It was almost as if Jennifer Aniston threw down the script and put her own life on screen as Jennifer Grogan.While the story and acting are superb Marley  Me is not the feel good Christmas cheer me up movie of the year. Not a dry eye in the theater for those old enough to have endured the sad reality of outliving a beloved pet. Imagine the heartache of Old Yeller multiplied by 10. An excellent movie for pet lovers newlywed couples and those searching for the meaning of life.".

Sebastian Eric Dane John Grogan's best human friend is the classical antithesis and a reminder of the freedoms of bachelorhood. Not until the chance encounter with Sebastian in Philadelphia do we see the completeness John has in his life with Jennifer the kids and Marley.A simple story coupled with a superb cast make Marley  Me a must see. Wilson's portrayal of Grogan is a welcome change from the often silly and one dimensional characters Wilson has become known for. Equally compelling is the character Jennifer Grogan Jennifer Aniston. At times it is often indistinguishable between the character Jennifer Grogan and the person Jennifer Aniston. It was almost as if Jennifer Aniston threw down the script and put her own life on screen as Jennifer Grogan.While the story and acting are superb Marley  Me is not the feel good Christmas cheer me up movie of the year. Not a dry eye in the theater for those old enough to have endured the sad reality of outliving a beloved pet. Imagine the heartache of Old Yeller multiplied by 10. An excellent movie for pet lovers newlywed couples and those searching for the meaning of life.";

I grew up as a teenager with a Golden Labrador in the family we all adored  in my early married life with a badly behaved Lassie Collie dog which had to be put down 13 years later. I could really relate to this family's experiences with their pooch  the sometimes angst it caused them. Our Collie chewed everything in sight  also managed to run straight through a plate glass door jumped out of the car window and broke a bone in his foot... so many experiences similar to this filmbook. And at the end of our pooch's life my by then exhusband cried like a baby when we had to have our dog put down.This film shows the whole life of Marley  how he was loved and at times despaired of and at the end the most cherished part of this family. Yes I cried at the end  I thought it beautifully done but I also was crying for the dog I miss so much now. I would just like the film to have rounded off the story  shown that Marley got a book published about him  that they next got a docile dog who was never going to make it to the press as he was in fact the model dog they thought they were getting with Marley. Lovely film  such a nice change from some of the garbage that's in the theatres these days.".

I don't have children but it occurred to me it would be a wonderful film to teach children about death by allowing them to see the natural progression as Marley slowly closes his eyes while his master tells him 'You're a great dog. Then I came home and played a game of ball with my Irish Setter and gave extra cookies to my half lab who looked so much like Marley. He is very old now and will soon come to that point where he won't want to continue on.

I'm not a big fan of Jennifer Aniston's work and while funny I feel that Owen Wilson is only capable of playing himself in the movie roles he's taken on. The same could probably be said for Jennifer Aniston to a degree as well.I was absolutely enthralled with this film though. As I'm sure most current and former dog owners were. The script was very solid and well structured to involve all the characters in Marley's life as an important part of it. The realistic connections made between the character's made the joy comedy frustrations and even sadness demonstrated in this story very significant and personal. The story of Marley and his life with his family could not have been told any better. I would say my favorite scene in this movie was when Marley was let off his leash at the doggie beach so he could run out to swim in the ocean.This movie gives a completely realistic portrayal of just how much love and joy a pet can bring to your life and how significant Man's Best Friend values their relationships with their owners. I would recommend this movie to all but with a stern warning that this movie will pull at your heart strings very hard with it's realistic depiction of dealing with the loss of a loved one. Very few movies I've watched in my life have connected with me on a personal level strong enough to actually bring tears to my eyes. This movie however had my face covered with streams.".

Instead it's a formulaic family flick made by dog owners for other dog owners. It's also a love letter to our best friends who are the only ones in our lives to see us at our highest and our lowest and who love us no matter what.The film captured the way a dog can steal your heart and how they truly are a member of the family and it pulls all the right heart strings at all the right moments. But is it a good film? Dog lovers will be captivated by the experience and have their hearts broken in the last 20 minutes while everyone else will probably just see a mediocre date movie with a cute puppy and routine performance from Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson. Being amongst the former audience I couldn't help but fall in love with the movie and I couldn't wait to get in my car and rush home to see my dogs.The dog lover in me gives this a 1010 while the movie buff in me gives this a 610 so overall I guess that's about an 810.".

There is an unwritten rule in these manwoman dramas the man misbehaves because he simply cannot control himself. Many of our Apatowlike plays have the problem that the guy has to be destructive but still by the end lovable.

	schema:reviewBody "There seems to be a consensus of opinion here that if you dislike this film it is simply because you're not a dog person and therefore you'll not get this film. For the record I don't have a dog but did grow up with a dog and like them while also liking cats. What I don't have is a willingness to access my own emotions and memories in order to use them to make up for the inadequacy of the film  which with all due respect a lot of people seem to be doing when they talk about why they love the film. So I understand what it is to have a dog as a companion to have the good and the bad and to have that be an emotional part of one's live. The problem I have with the film is that I'm not convinced the people who make the film do  or rather I'm not convinced they know how to put that into a script and then put it on the screen.I say this because the narrative here is a really simple story of a family  and there is nothing wrong with that it is about life rather than a specific set of events that lead to one another on the way to a dramatic conclusion. However without an engaging and convincing heart to the film then this just comes over like a superficial scenario put together with music video moments and no depth or complexity to the lives on which the film relies. To help with the emotion we have lots of safe accessible pop songs used in the soundtrack  something that says packaging and market targeting more than it does film making of course any scene with emotion is loaded with manipulative music to draw the emotion  and if you're into it then perhaps it will work but it is hard to avoid just how superficial it is.The casting confirms this as the beautiful blonde leads are both bland as sin and do not convince as characters or as a couple. It doesn't help that the film doesn't even attempt to age them physically and that the script does little to age their spirits. Wilson does his usual stuff but without the comedy that usually makes his personae works he is quite poor and he cannot do the emotions that the basic events of his character's life ask him to deliver. Aniston is just as weak and is badly cast  her figure and looks working against her while she tries to use her words only to convince us that she is a mother of three and going through real challenges. The dog itself is good at being cute but personally I struggled to really see what it was they loved in it  probably because the script only gives me comedy events rather than a family with the dog at the heart of it.Marley  Me will get better with time  not because history will judge it well but rather because it will move out of cinemas onto DVD and eventually reach its true home on Wednesday afternoons on a network like Hallmark. For those that love those daytime movies then you should like this but for the majority of viewers this will be far too superficial and bland to really impact.".

It reminded me without being similar to a favorite of my own childhood Old Yeller and that alone placed me on a very special frame of mind. Jennifer Aniston surprised me. Her performance feels and sounds truthful and thoughtful. The mother of three who left behind a promising career to dedicate herself fully to her family reeks of a familiar kind of pathology that Aniston takes all the way without allowing the acting get in the way. I believed her and that makes things work on all levels. Then Alan Arkin he creates a fully fledged character out of a clich. He's wonderful. And Marley? The series of extraordinary dogs who played the arch of this unconventional creature is a triumph of sorts. Some of the music and Marley running I could have done without and I must confess I wouldn't have cast Owen Wilson but that's just too small a problem to spoil the surprise this movie provides. Kathleen Turner plays a cameo as a dog instructor that provoked a gasp in the audience. She's closer to Shirley Stoler in Seven Beauties than to Geena Davis in The Accidental Turist Use your kids as an excuse to see Marley. It works.".

	schema:reviewBody "Marley and Me is one of the best allaround movies I've seen in a long time. Owen Wilson poured himself into his character for the first time I've seen on film and was superb as authormain character John Grogan. The title dog was magnificent and the training that must have gone into the filming is difficult to imagine giving all that the dog did. Jennifer Aniston's support was professional. She provided a perfect and realistic compliment to the perpetually restless Grogan. Alan Arkin was excellent as Grogan's cynical but supportive editor. Kathleen Turner was a hoot as a Germanic dog trainer and I was thrilled to see Joyce Van Patten as the prudish proprietor of an Irish Bed and Breakfast. The dogsitter was also a hoot. She reminded me of Emily Blunt but since I didn't see her in the cast I must be mistaken. Whoever she was she was brilliant. I was not familiar with Eric Dane from the TV show mentioned but I thought he was quite fitting for the Sebastian character Grogan's boyfriend who gets to do all the things Grogan wishes to do. He certainly is handsome. The actors playing the children all played their parts in a realistic yet sentimental fashion consistent with the movie.The movie was also very well paced. I didn't look at my watch once which for me is a major feat. I warn that Marley and Me is not a lightweight comedy. It will make you cry and if you do take children you should probably prepare them in advance for the issues involved when a pet can no longer continue.".

The one I finally got into sold out as well. For each show it was the same thing. People laughed until they cried then just cried.It's a touching movie based on a real life dog you'll never want to forget.I'll tell you one thing. It gave me a better appreciation for my pups at home and how they've already changed my life for the better.There are a few people that say the end was too graphic. that's a shame. You missed the WHOLE point of the movie getting stuck on that one scene. the scene was necessary. If it were cut the movie would have lost that one thing that connects the audience to the Grogan family. The mutual understanding. You were there through the good times you grieved with them through the hard times. you shared the emotions. you shared a mutual love for Marley from the beginning of the book to the end of the movie.It was raw it was graphic but we were sharing a moment that only pet owners can truly understand.I always find it amusing that there will be people who find this movie appalling because it touches a raw emotional nerve but will turn around and bring their kids to Rated R movies with graphic sex or foul langage and violence. Kind of like the 5 year old who sat screaming a row in front of me at Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix... a much darker and way more violent chapter to the Harry Potter series... go fig".

So the genre is several millennia old. If people are going to accuse Barnyard of plagiarism they should at least check the original source material before throwing stones.Anyway onto the film. I thought it was lightweight but had some very funny parts. Thankfully my children 13 and 8 are able to separate fact from fiction so the images of bulls with udders getting loaded on milk stealing a car and evading the police whilst joyriding probably won't have too much of a negative impact on their lives. However if when they're older they fall into the company of a gang of cows with attitude and a propensity for car theft I'll know who to blame.Some people really need to lighten up.".

I agree that it should not be ranked along side Finding Nemo or The Incredibles however it does have some hilariously funny moments.This movie stars Kevin James King of Queens and Courtney Cox the woman we all know from Friends. It also has some performances from Danny Glover and Sam Elliot.Overall if you are looking for a mind blowing animated movie jam packed full of hilarity then this movie probably isn't what you are looking for but if you are just looking for a decent laugh then this is worth your while.710".

	schema:reviewBody "My boyfriend and I decided to go see this movie after we heard on the radio that it was a good movie worth seeing even up there with Cars. Within the first ten minutes of the movie I was horrified. For starters the cows which should be females had male voices. Then I realized they really are supposed to be guys. I put the transvestite cows aside for a bit and tried to keep watching the movie with an open mind but it was just so corny I couldn't help but shake my head. I probably checked my phone about ten times to see if it was almost over. The plot was decent if not predictable but it took way to long to reach its point. I was having trouble sitting through it and I'm 19. The children in the theater were actually getting up and running up and down the aisles. I felt like joining them. But my biggest problem with the movie was that it was loaded with drinking references not to mention that the cowsbulls actually hot wired and stole a car then drank and drive broke into a boy's house to push him out of bed he deserved it though then ran away from the cops whom the writers of the movie made look like terrible people. This isn't the kind of thing I would want my kid to be exposed to. There's way too much of that in the real world if I wanted my child to watch guys drink and drive and lead cops on a chase I'd pop them in front of the 10 o'clock news. Children's movies are supposed to be an escape from reality not an escape into ridiculousness. What happened to the good morals and happy endings that children's movies used to boast? That's why Disney's old movies like Beauty and the Beast Lady and the Tramp The Little Mermaid etc. are classics. If you want your kids to see a great cartoon with basically the same plot as Barnyard rent The Lion King. You can get a great story without the awful drinking and driving and grand theft auto references. The writers of Barnyard were obviously trying to continue the great trend of making a children's movie that a parent could enjoy as well but they did so in very bad taste. I would never take my kids to see this and I suggest you save your money and watch something else.".

His sworn duty is to protect the animals from a pack of vicious coyotes led by the vile Dax David Koechner Anchorman.Ben's favorite saying is A strong man stands up for himself a stronger man stands up for others. Ben's adopted son Otis Kevin James King Of Queens however has no such loyalties or philosophy and is a living example that cows just want to have fun. That includes partying all night in a literal barn dance ice surfing off a tall mountain with his idiot friends or going for a joyride and boytipping with some Jersey cows. Otis is definitely one nonstop party animal.When his father is attacked by the coyotes while trying to protect the farm though Otis has got some growing up to do  real fast.

	schema:headline " Funniest  Most Entertaining for adults Animated Film I Have Ever Seen";
	schema:reviewBody "Just when I recently wrote about a new animated film being the best I've ever seen Cars a week later I watch this movie and now I have a new number one. I cannot believe how funny how entertaining this film was. I give it a nod over Cars for two reasons 1  it's easier to watch being a halfhour shorter at 89 minutes and 2  it's even funnier.This movie especially in the beginning provides almost nonstop laughs the kind that adults were laugh at probably more than kids would. This is adultfunny but don't misinterpret there is nothing raunchy in the script. It's not totally innocent either.I do wave a red flag for small kids. There are a couple of scenes in here that are definitely too scary for little ones. I am referring to a pack of coyotes attacking Ben the father character seen early in the movie and literally killing him. That and the short funeral scene are too intense for impressionable kids. Later the coyotes return a few times too. Those mothers who complained about their little kids seeing this have a legitimate point.Nonetheless for me  and I assume most other adults  the rest of this is pure entertainment with a little sentiment mixed into the comedy as the main character Otis voiced by Kevin James learns to grow up. Otis however is one of the funniest characters I have ever seen on film animated or not. When he and his barnyard pals are partying it up which is frequently it's just hilarious. With those parties comes some great music too. I found myself really into the music more than on any animated film I have watched or heard.And  not only is the music excellent the visuals are outstanding. The movie is filled with rich deep colors that are stupendous to view.Whether you are a teen or a senior citizen I would think you would get a lot of laughs out of this movie. Some of the best animated films I have ever seen have come out in the past year or two and I have to believe I'll probably watch this one more times than any of them.".

This one though the second it finished I had to pull my sister who had wanted to see it out by the arm and I burst into tears of laughter as soon as I got out because it was such a ridiculously awful movie. Why it was awful  all the cows had udders especially bothersome were the MALE ones with udders  none of the characters were unique or engaging except perhaps the main Coyote Dag  the idea of cows keeping watch against coyotes is just ridiculous  the 'funny' moments are repetitive and become simply a sequence to outdo the last one  the themes of working together which should have been present at the end were nonexistent. Instead people get the impression Well I'll take this all upon myself and in this case I was lucky that my friends decided to back me up without my knowledge  all the moments similar to the lion king as mentioned below were beyond corniness even for a kid's movieand...the worst of all... IT PARALLELS THE LION KING IN EVERY SINGLE WAY Responsible father figure who is killed by Coyotes the Coyotes are essentially the Hyenas with Dag the lead Coyote being the equivalent of Scar The farm falls into chaos Odis the cow though basically Simba wants to play around and is shocked that his dad died believes it was his fault even though in this movie it WAS his fault confronts the Coyotes and gets an ass whooping after which Dag tells him to leave and on the verge of leaving Odis somehow decides to go and save some chickens and his friends back him up by complete surprise of course he leaves without knowing they will come help him. Other things taken from Lion King stars moving around as signs father figures referring to starssigns in a mystical loving way the obviously circularness of how the father Ben found Odis and took care of him and how at the end Odis' love interest gives birth and he has a similar experience. Birth at the end? GOOD GOD what the hell... and even similar type music which seems completely tacked on at the end because it is completely different from all the previous music.Honestly this is the first movie I have ever seen where I really WAS rooting for the bad guys  I never understood what other people were saying until now.BOTTOM LINE Don't waste your time to go see this. Convince the kids not to see it and rewatch the Lion King. Either that or take them to see the Ant Bully which was creative and artistic.".

If we are going to expose our children to drek it might as well have the simplest facts correct.7  Boring and Borish. My 4 year old had us leave after 45 minutes. He practically fell asleep.I'm sure this movie will make millions which is unfortunate because it only proves to Hollywood producers that the American public at large is just filled with suckers waiting to pay 8 bucks just to get some peace and quiet from the kids for an hour or two. An unfortunate circumstance. Why should the producers spend real money when the returns will be the same either way.".

I was disturbed the ENTIRE time that there were male cows. I had a hard time getting into the plot because I couldn't get over seeing udders on what should have been bulls with NO udders. Male cattle are bulls and they don't have udders. There is enough ignorance in the world and especially in America without writers and directors and producers not taking the time or intelligence to think that what they are showing to the general public can actually affect them. How many little children that have never seen a real cow and will never grow up on a farm or near real cows will grow up believing that there are MALE COWS WITH UDDERS? Even the woman beside us turned to us and said she thought that the movie was disturbing showing male cattle as cows with udders instead of as bulls with no udders.Like the comment before mine said hisher children were mesmerized. Well a movie that can mesmerize can also teach and what are they teaching? They are teaching a new generation of children to be stupid. And to be drunks. I do agree with that person that it was unnecessary to show drunkenness as being fun. Don't we have enough problems with people destroying their lives with alcoholism and don't we have enough AAA members and homeless people who have ruined their lives and the lives of their families without trying to promote drunkenness as fun in cartoons for a new generation of children? How many lives of child actors and actresses have been destroyed because they viewed drugs and alcohol as a way to have fun?".

The whole theatre was cracking up mostly the whole time. It was really funny and children and adults will both love it. Just to note though there are just a few scenes where younger children might be a bit frightened but it's not enough where you should not take them to see this. I highly recommend this to everyone.

No mental problems or confusion  they get it.It was entertaining with great voice talent a good lesson and a nice new variation on modern computer animation. There are some things that are cartoonish shapes of animals and things and other things that are amazingly realistic skyclouds hairfur fire. It was an intriguing mix in my opinion.All three of my children and my 12 yearold nephew loved the movie. There was humor on their level jokes that adults could relate to and a somewhat predictable but satisfying storyline.I consider movies worth seeing in the theater OR wait and watch at home. They have to have something special to pay 60 for the family to see without the ability to pause no guarantee of good seats noisy neighbors etc etc. I have a soft spot for animated features and I think the special factor of going to the theater makes it worth taking the kids to this one.".

So in the movie he has to learn how to take control and guard the barnyard from the evil coyotes which are the ones who killed his dad.The animation and voice casting was well done and chosen. The animation is spectacular and has a lot of detail making it a beautiful picture for the eyes. Also the voices for each animal suits them very well and the expression in their voices are very good. Also the music is well chosen mainly Johnny Cash's version of I won't Back Down. The movie has it's funny parts and would be a lot funnier for children but it made me laugh a few times and when I did it was hard laughs.I really enjoyed this movie even though I wasn't really in the mood for this type of film but it I was I would have loved it even more then I already do.

My sons ages 6 and 9 were bored and I took a nap. How? The reason I could take nap is because it was dead silent in the theater. It was not funny at all.The funniest part of the movie was the transsexual male cows. Most of the jokes were geared toward adults not children. My boys only laughed at the physical humor. However it did manage to be racially offensive and violent. Save your money and go to a real farm for entertainment.".

It won't be your top five of the year and you won't watch it a million times but you should really like it. It won't blow you away but it won't disappoint you.I give my opinion on this movie not as a fully fledged movie expert fully upto date premiergoing Oscarloving critic  but as an artistically natured deep rooted film lover. And I say this movie is worth watching. It has a bit of everything that is to be desired in a good movie. While a lot could've been different and you could've improved it in many ways it's still fine just as it is.The story in this movie is excellent. How it is portrayed and told is great. The actors all fulfill their role some with splendor. And no matter what anyone might have told you this movie is greatly artistical.I believe Push is quite unique in many ways foremost for its unusual lack of hierarchy of the powers you see in the film. You're used to see a lot of people possessing powers but only one of them  Magneto for instance  being the one standing above all else. But in Push no one is the obvious stronger one.Push uses a lot of twists and not in the firstSawmovie way which blows you out of your seat but it still manages to keep the movie interesting even tough the twists are all quite predictable.Push is also as I said greatly artistical. It has a lot of fantastic colors and utilizes lighting very well it's set in very beautiful environments and there are a lot of other great cinematic techniques being used. I especially like the choice of soundtrack in this movie. It reminds me a lot of the way they choose to use music in The Dark Knight. Instead of some really catchy noticeable soundtrack there's been a very diligent work done with a subtle yet powerful soundtrack that emerges only when necessary and gives an indescribable force to the movie.All in all Push is a quite nonmainstream entertaining good movie worth watching.".

And the acting isn't too bad either. Applause for Dakota Fanning and Chris Evans. Also I really enjoyed the way the movie was shot there was somehow this sense of realism to the whole thing.However I didn't enjoy Camilla Belle's acting. Although I did enjoy her performance in The Quiet she just seemed really off in this movie. Either she wasn't given enough screen time or she was outshone by Dakota.By the way those who are comparing this show to HEROES are preposterous. Telekineseis and all of these special abilities have been around long before then! Though I am a huge fan of HEROES I think it's really nothing in comparison to PUSH.By the way this show had me glued to the sit even when I really had to use the toilet.

This new genre of movies which includes Jumper and Wanted generally involves characters with psychic or psionic abilities a conspiratorial shadow group and an unlikely antihero set against a banal or dystopian realism. Push blows these other two admittedly weak offerings out of the cinematic water.Both the visuals and the action in Push are quite good. Push is set in HongKong. The city has enough exotic flavor to be interesting and enough grit to provide a realistic backdrop for the more fanciful elements of the film. The filmmakers captured the feeling of a William Gibson novel without having to set the film at night in the rain for the entire movie.The action sequences are excellent. Push does not suffer from the hyperkinetic shakethecamerauntiltheviewerisconfused action sequences of Bourne Ultimatum or Quantum of Solace. In Push you know who is punching whom and you can tell who is winning.Visual effects? Here is what sold me on this film and on this filmmaker's vision When a mover a person with telekinetic powers uses his ability to push something away or to enhance the power of a punch yes I said TKenhanced fight sequences...don't drool on your keyboard the visual effects people were smart enough to consider the effect on the nearby air. The air gets...crimped and as a result the light refracts in a split second rainbow pattern at the moment of impact. That level of forethought and detail is what Jumper and Wanted lacked.Another element that this movie possesses that Jumper and Wanted doesn't is a focus on the characters. Any movie or show about psychic powers or superpowers lives or dies on the relationships between the characters. The male lead and Dakota Fanning are excellent together and quickly establish a rapport that gives the film more depth. Honorable mention goes to the enemy watchershe is genuinely threatening lollipop notwithstanding. I also loved the tip of the hat to the anime genre exhibited in Cassie's Fanning wardrobe.This movie is worth every bit of the matine price I paid. And I will probably watch it again.A few points One this is not a superhero movie. While people who like Heroes and some of the Marvel films might enjoy this movie one should not go in expecting that kind of experience.Two I do wish that the producers had about 15 million extra dollars. The extra money would have allowed them to show more of the story and neatly tie a couple of loose ends rather than telling the audience. I sincerely hope this film does well enough to garner a more expansively budgeted sequel.Three this movie has some minor plot issues especially a small deux ex machina cum Toyota that might bother some. But if you choose to buy into the experience Push will take you on a fantastic ride.Blindcurve".

Hong Kong offers an exotic background for the action to take place.The movie makes an interesting attempt at being half action thriller reminiscent of a Bourne movie and half superhero blockbuster in the tradition of the XMen. But director Paul McGuigan is never able to make us fully feel for the characters and their ordeal and the action sequences while pleasant to watch never instill emotional response. We're not scared for anyone our blood does not pump during chases either. The two stars of Push are an unlikely duo of actor which surprised me somewhat. Chris Evans has often been derided as being just another bland pretty face. Here he is paired with young Dakota Fanning who has been revered by many as a child prodigy actress. What's interesting to me is that had I not seen previous films from these two I wouldn't notice much difference in quality between the two. They both give a suitable performance. Neither Oscarworthy nor garbage.Unfortunately the support cast is very weak. Camilla Belle is pretty but bland as usual. Cliff Curtis and Djimon Hounsou are both amazing actors but here they have very little to work with. I blame McGuigan and writer David Bourla for not providing them with opportunities to shine. What makes this movie a 5 rather than a 6 is its confusing and botched conclusion. As if somehow the production ran out of time and needed to wrap things up on the spot. Perhaps hoping for a sequel? Push has an intriguing premise and more than enough basic material to be stretched into a trilogy or even a short TV series but as is the rule of thumb with those sort of things it is doubtful things will get better should sequels be produced. I wish the premise had been used to tell a better story in a better way.".

So what if this film's plot seems needlessly complicated and so what if there are way too many narrative threads that don't ever get completely developed and so what if the whole thing is edited to within an inch of its life? It's still pretty fun if you're in the mood for it.Chris Evans and Dakota Fanning are the nominal stars and Djimon Hounsou makes an appearance proving yet again that what he really needs more than anything is a better dialect coach.The crazy color palettes and art direction in this film reminded me as I was watching it of Lucky Number Slevin another bit of entertaining B pulp. How funny then that I look at this film's director's Paul McGuigan resume only to find that it includes....you guessed it.....Lucky Number Slevin. If nothing else his films certainly have a visual style in common.Grade B".

	schema:reviewBody "The trailer for Push did not give me a desire to see it in the theater... It was actually a last minute choice to go see it in hopes to see a good action movie. I was certainly surprised  I have heard some bad reviews of this film but I must say the choice to go see it was WORTH my time. The story was excellent and pieced together very well. The way it was written was something I rarely see in movies anymore. Most directors rely on special effects and explosions anymore but Push used it's actionCG as a companion to the plot. The plot's structure was on the line of The Jacket or Burn After Reading where details no matter how subtle seem to twist and mesh into a wellthoughtout idea. The little visions of the future and appearance of random characters are not meant to be simply passed off. You are allowed to think in this one... What a nice change! Switches between the gritty and crisp colorful filming worked well in bringing a certain mood to the appropriate scenes which also looks brilliant on BluRay. The actions scenes were great as well... With the company of the Pushers' powers and the manipulation of people and objects around them those scenes did not usually go in the direction I anticipated.This is not fair to call Push a super hero movie. It is not really a super hero movie nor is it a traditional action movie I believe this was the intention. The bolder science fiction basis kept the plot focused and within the realm of its own feel and stayed away from the everything everyone else is doing feel. Actions scenes were powerful yet short I was left wanting more so when the next series of craziness began I was more involved and appreciated it more. Sure there were some editing flaws but even major blockbusters going back to Jurassic Park have issues. Even still I have found that some of these reported flaws in Push are incorrect after viewing it for a second time on BluRay. As a final note the entire cast held their roles wonderfully and left a lasting impression of each of their characters. I guarantee that if the original cast chose to return I would be in line for a Push sequel on opening night.".

Camilla belle acted just as she should a little out of place a little out of time. that was exactly what she had to be like in my opinion. Dakota fanning. that's an interesting one. can't exactly describe what i think of her acting she is in a strange acting age too old to be little too little to be older. reminded me of Natalie portman in Leon struggling to look older and more mature than she actually is. but the role was all about this struggle so she coped with it very well. the villains was a minus cause they were not so villains after all especially in the beginning were the two brothers were screaming like primadonas and i was like what the hell? Evans can move stuff Dakota can see the future belle can f your mind and the bad guys what? they're replicas of rob halford? what were the Nazis thinking?? 'we'll come to your house and break all your crystal so surrender' . anyway the Chinese guys weren't so fearful after all but they were the minor villains and i wonder why they didn't die earlier on the film. at least they did one thing right they annoyed me so i was happy they died at the end. hounsou and his blond assistant were good bad enough though! so i call it almost even.anyway i started writing a little comment on the movie and i ended up mumbling. so to put an end on this all i'm saying is that push is a fun to watch film with fair enough performances great direction nice plot and a nice although suspected twist n the end. it won't become your all time favorite but it will sure entertain you.".

	schema:reviewBody "The old saying goes all style no substance but the same cannot be said for Push. If anything this superheroesque scifi actionier is more like all substance no sense. I have found one of the carnal sins of movie making is trying to smarten up a movie that doesn't need to be bumped up a peg. In place of breakneck action director Paul McGuigan who helmed the 2006 cult hit Lucky Number Slevin has opted to cram more information and backstory down our gullets then an unlucky turkey on thanksgiving yet without ever really accomplishing anything but convolution. To be fair there is still a good lot to recommend about this film. Nobody could accuse Push of being unoriginal and to McGuigan's credit the characters are more fully realized then those in most films of a similar ilk McGuigan himself said he was more concerned with the character element then the action. Yet from the confusing opening to the splurge of character introduction in the opening act many will find themselves drifting off and losing interest. Thankfully by the final act the mood has settled the heroes and villains drift in and out enough to become familiar and the supernatural element becomes significantly less convoluted. Although some postfilm research helped further yet Cementing the movie in the realm of watchability is a spectacular final battle shot almost entirely with stuntwork and the gritty effect is quite enticing. The world is not as it may seem. Psychics are very real and they are both a blessing and a curse to a shadowy and sinister organization known only The Division oooh scary. Heavily monitored some of those with special gifts work for The Division others are on the run some in hiding but some become part of secret experiments to harness their unique gifts as weapons. Among these unique individuals are varying varieties of skills there are Bleeders who can emit high frequency screeches that cause death Movers who can move objects with their mind Pushers who can insert thoughts and memories into others and the list goes on to include Shadow's Shifter's Sniffer's Stitcher's Watcher's and Wiper's. You can see where confusion could set in The story begins with a young Mover named Nick Grant Chris Evans who is attempting to avoid the Division and its shady leader Carver Djimon Hounsou who wants to keep tabs on him. He crosses paths with a young but gifted Watcher named Cassie Dakota Fanning who unfortunately has the nasty propensity to predict their deaths. Leading them to a high value subject of The Division's Kira coincidently an old flame of Nick's Cassie Nick and Kira try to prevent the powerful agency from getting hold of dangerous and powerful drug. I won't go any further into the plot then that because otherwise I'm fairly certain you would never read my reviews again. Of the countless films in recent years Push reminds me the most of Jumper in more ways then one. They both feature a small population of gifted individuals being hunted by a powerful and secretive organization and with both securing the skills of a ruthless African American agent. In Jumper's case it was Samuel L. Jackson More similar yet is the clear indication that the films are intended to be the first in a series of many I will say that Push does an infinitely better job of wrapping up its chapter then the shamelessly gaping ending of Jumper and with both I feel that any subsequent instalments will be a large improvement over the setup and confusion of the original. So when push comes to shove here is hoping that studios feel this inventive but uneven chase adventure was enough of a success for a sequel. 6.5  10.0Read all my reviews at httpwww.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " Yes it was awful!";
	schema:reviewBody "I did not know anything about this movie before I saw it. I saw the poster and realized it had to be about supernatural abilities. And I love a good superhero movie. I even saw Superhero Movie with a smile although I wouldn't praise that one in any way.But this one. Damn it's awful. Believe me.Sure it has some good action scenes. I did enjoy the battle between Nick and the agent with the same telekinetic powers. That was an original way to make use of this particular power. At least I can't remember having seen something like that before.But the story is a mess. And nothing will save a bad story. Not when it is this bad. Here are my problems spoilers ahead.The watchers. They predict the future. But how. Not even the writer knows. At one point Dakota explains that they read your intentions. Your thoughts as you are about to act. Hence they make a brilliant plan where Nick will write what everybody else has to do on some cards. This way nobody will know what to do until the moment they do it. Afterwards Nick will get his memory wiped and the future will be a mystery.Sounds good? Well here are some flaws.a Nick knows what everybody will do for 2 hours before his mind is wiped. That's a lot of time to read his mind considering that the watchers must have been able to do so within seconds based on what they have predicted previously in the movie.b There are lot's of other predictions that appear to have nothing to do with people's intentions or thoughts. At one point Dakota is wandering the streets trying not to think about where she's heading. At a crossroad she closes her eyes and spins around but an evil watcher is able to detect what path she took even though she doesn't know herself. And she ends up exactly where she herself had predicted that she would die. There is no way that these predictions could have been based merely on intentions.c But somehow Nick knew exactly where she would be and was able to instruct the wiper to be there also in time to rescue her. But how? Nick isn't a watcher. And even if he was none of these events was based on intentions.This means that the ability to watch i.e. predict the future is inconsistent. The story tells you a fact but doesn't stick to that fact. And I consider that to be sloppy writing.It even stretches this fact to the point where Nick gets his memory wiped and at the exact same moment the evil watcher senses that the future has somehow disappeared. Whatever she was sensing up to that point without actually reading all the information in his mind who knows? Maybe she had forgotten to tune in and was listening to some white noise.d Nick is also somehow able to predict that the agent boss will use his pushing powers to make Camilla believe that she and Nick have never been dating and never been to Long Island. That she is an agent also and has participated willingly. Hence he tells her in advance to read her instructions when she begins to doubt the truth and her instruction card is a picture of them both at Long Island with the message to shoot him. Fortunately him at the time happened to be the agent boss.I could go on. I honestly felt that a lot of the twists and turns of the story was made up to get out of a corner without considering if that particular twist or turn in any way could go against the continuity or the logic of the story as a whole.And that might be alright if this was a Steven Seagal movie. Or something similar. But this one made the mistake of making the viewer expect something more.".

I even saw Superhero Movie with a smile although I wouldn't praise that one in any way.But this one. Damn it's awful. Believe me.Sure it has some good action scenes. I did enjoy the battle between Nick and the agent with the same telekinetic powers. That was an original way to make use of this particular power. At least I can't remember having seen something like that before.But the story is a mess. And nothing will save a bad story. Not when it is this bad. Here are my problems spoilers ahead.The watchers. They predict the future. But how. Not even the writer knows. At one point Dakota explains that they read your intentions. Your thoughts as you are about to act. Hence they make a brilliant plan where Nick will write what everybody else has to do on some cards. This way nobody will know what to do until the moment they do it. Afterwards Nick will get his memory wiped and the future will be a mystery.Sounds good? Well here are some flaws.a Nick knows what everybody will do for 2 hours before his mind is wiped.

Mostly though this film is Stephen King's Fire Starter in a whole new wrapper with some new and improved effects.The concept has undoubtedly been realized before. The plot is fair to put it best and the characters are for the most part  likable and interesting. The effects are pretty good too. Sadly the story is a little weak but not terrible.For a pass time and some popcorn the film is favorable. But there probably won't be any awards won here. If you are really critical about movies and how you spend your money you may wish to wait for DVD. Otherwise if you just need something to do and you want to waste some time in fantasy land check it out at the theaters.".

You'll feel like you're watching an almost 2 hour long TV commercial. You expect cool fighting scenes? Don't. There's exactly two of them in the whole film and the director decided to abuse the shaky cam technique. Abuse it so bad you will feel motion sickness. There's a lot of filler material in there. I honestly wonder how they managed to make it almost 2 hours long. If you cut out all the completely unnecessary carcommercial types of montages you'll probably narrow this down to 75 minutes or so. Last but not least the cast. This is the only vaguely redeeming part of this mess. Chris Evans does a good job and Dakota Fanning isn't too annoying I guess. All in all this is a waste of time.

The film ends too soon but takes too long in getting to its truncated conclusion and a surplus in character quantity allows few to be explored adequately. Movers Pushers Shifters Sniffers Bleeders Watchers and more inhabit this unique realm of psychically enhanced beings and while each has a specific super power most feel like they were invented just to counter the abilities of another type of psychic warrior. The Division a group of government agents charged with experimenting on those gifted with psychic powers has devised a serum that will drastically enhance the user's performance. The only drawback is that none have survived the dosage  until now. Kira Camilla Belle is a pusher able to force a fabricated reality into another's mind who has withstood the normally fatal injection and upon escaping her captors manages to stay one step ahead of them by utilizing her tremendous psychic gift. Cassie Dakota Fanning is a watcher able to see into an everchanging future who seeks out downtrodden Nick Chris Evans a mover who has squandered his talent for moving objects with his mind. Together the duo must rescue Kira from The Division's main puppet Carver Djimon Hounsou and locate a mysterious case that contains the last hope of bringing down the tyrannical agency. The overlong third act in Push is largely dependent on circumstances that have no factual support. Nick realizes that every move they make is being predicted by other watchers the only way to avoid intentions that can be tracked is to be completely spontaneous. This involves plotting out a scheme and then having his memory wiped just far back enough that he won't remember coming up with the plan. Since when was Nick so brilliant that he could devise such a solution  let alone one that a group of talented psychic warriors would blindly follow? It's as if he's Neo in the Matrix and the supporting characters are to assume he's The One. Whether we choose to ignore the plausibility of the denouement there's also the matter of an overabundance of superpowered mutants each one with unique abilities. It's not that it's difficult to keep track of who is capable of what but rather few of the talents are given much definition or screen time. In fact the most exciting cabalistic showdown doesn't even initially involve Nick but rather with cool Division henchman Victor who gets to combat machinegun bullets with his bare hands. In the end Push had plenty of potential and the setup for sequels but the wow factor is tragically neutral. Action special effects and flashy editing can't make us care for characters and events that seem trivial despite crafting a world that is both fascinating and not too outlandish that it can't be explained during the opening title sequence voiceover. By its very intricate nature the events and circumstances in Push work to make its audience think about what they've just seen  which unfortunately brings undue attention to the numerous plot holes and nonsensical predicament resolutions our heroes face. In the end it's more fun than not but the film finds itself feeling more like the first part of a story rather than a standalone adventure burdened by the responsibility of introduction to an elaborate new world.

Here he meets the clairvoyant Cassie an alcoholdrinking miniskirtwearing Dakota Fanning who insists the only way the two of them can escape their impending deaths is if they find a certain girl named Kira Camilla Belle before Division villain Harvey Carver Djimon Honsou or a Chinese gang does.While the film's premise of shabby rebels going up against spiffy corporate baddies sometimes feel overly familiar the real downer is how David Bourla's initially promising script eventually trips into arbitrarily drawn expositions and incoherent babbling from trying so hard to complicate matters perhaps as an extenuation for its conventions. McGuigan's flashy direction and the visually striking locale keep the whole thing sporadically interesting although the ultimately disorienting effect makes one wonder whether Nick's remark that nothing they do should make sense mirror the filmmakers' intention of turning this into a pile of drivel as they leisurely stroll along.".

With all the amazing abilities and skills of the key players in this plot I don't see how this movie doesn't have a better rating than all the xmen garbage put together. I love scifi and to see this many skilled actors in one place that are using amazing powers to make the world a better place definitely made my movie day.

I'm not saying this to put them down it's just that there are differences between Eastern and Western storytelling and it is sometimes difficult for me to leave my Western way of thinking and getting into that Eastern perspective when watching a movie from there. That being said this movie written by a Westerner makes less sense than any Asian action film I have ever seen. EVER.The main idea of this film is a kind of shadow war being waged by those with psychic powers. There are movers people with telekinetic powers watchers people who can see the future and pushers people who can mentally control others. Other powers featured are psychometry psychic healing memory wiping hypersonic screaming and psychic tracking but they are minor players.The first half is actually pretty coherent but then the second half becomes impossibly convoluted as the protagonists try to outwit an enemy watcher not to mention a few monkey wrenches thrown in by pushers. And they did a damn good job. I tried to ignore the particulars and stay focused on an object that everyone seemed to be fighting for but I couldn't even do that.It's a real shame too because there were some elements that worked namely Dakota Fanning. She put on a good performance even though she was saddled with this mess of a plot. If an actor can do that that means they're good IMHO.Anyway unless you can disengage your brain and just enjoy this movie as a pure visual thrill ride then you are better off not seeing it.".

I haven't ranted so much about a film since the last Bond film Quantum of Solace! It's basically a set up for a hopefully abandoned sequel indicated by the cliffhanger ending.Overall This is the epitome of all flash and NO substance.

I'd rather not try to explain the entire plot it's just pretty much a rescue mission with romance gore some alright anime scenes and a giant snake. I enjoy all of those facets of entertainment and even though Sars Wars didn't do a great job combining the lot it still was a pretty fun movie to watch.It's Thai humor to a T. It even has some transsexual moments which is always funny and unbelievable since it's a big thing over there. Anyways if you're looking for a new gore flick to check out this definitely fits the bill. You might even enjoy the sillyass Thai humor too. 7 outta 10".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't know what to think going into SARS WARS except that I didn't think I'd really dig it all that much. I'm not a huge horrorcomedy fan although there are a few that are brilliant so I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy this one very much. I have to say I was VERY pleasantly surprised. SARS WARS is completely off the wall  and though very derivative in terms of most of the films elements  it pulls everything together nearly flawlessly...Apparently the SARS virus has mutated into it's fourth strain that turns people into zombies. Thailand was unaffected until some bug flew in carrying the disease and bites a local resident. Next thing ya know all hell breaks loose in an office building where the virus is quickly being transmitted. Into this mix  throw in a bungled kidnapping plot and rescue attempt a giant mutated snake an acrobatic zombified baby and a building full of zombies...yeah  you can't really miss with that combination.The best part about SARS WARS is that it is genuinely funny. Like laughoutloud funny. The jokes work in this one.

I'm not a huge horrorcomedy fan although there are a few that are brilliant so I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy this one very much. I have to say I was VERY pleasantly surprised. SARS WARS is completely off the wall  and though very derivative in terms of most of the films elements  it pulls everything together nearly flawlessly...Apparently the SARS virus has mutated into it's fourth strain that turns people into zombies. Thailand was unaffected until some bug flew in carrying the disease and bites a local resident. Next thing ya know all hell breaks loose in an office building where the virus is quickly being transmitted. Into this mix  throw in a bungled kidnapping plot and rescue attempt a giant mutated snake an acrobatic zombified baby and a building full of zombies...yeah  you can't really miss with that combination.The best part about SARS WARS is that it is genuinely funny. Like laughoutloud funny. The jokes work in this one.

It took awhile for me to realize that this movie had a comedic silly side. It took me awhile to get into the mix of violence adventure and goofball humor...but only about ten or fifteen minutes and then I found myself laughing and enjoying myself. The story is about a virus called Sars 4 that is going around turning people into zombies. While this is going on a group of nottoobright badasses are trying to kidnap a wealthy man's nubile school girl daughter. There is a herotype who is in love with her and trying to get her back. There's also his wise old teacher and a sexy female doctor running around. I know it's hard for me to explain the plot because there is so much crammed into the hour and half here that you really must see it for yourself. If you like goofy martial arts revenge flicks like Story Of Ricky and silly zombie spoofs like Shaun Of The Dead this movie is Must See. I can honestly say it's not like anything else I've ever seen!".

	schema:reviewBody "Sars Wars is a fast paced and highly enjoyable Thai zombie comedy. At its core this is a film that revels in absurdity. The action and gore is more than enough to satiate the hardened zombie buff. The zany comedy is both internal and chips away at the fourth wall. A potential problem with this film is the fact that it is stylized for a niche audience. Essentially this is a film that one either enjoys or passes off as a hohum addition to the horror genre. Additionally the very aspects that make this film wonderful for some may also make it a turkey for others.SW diverges from typical Thai film in one distinctive way. Overall Thai film uses the landscapes or urban settings of Thailand as an integral feature of the film. The pristine nature or bustling streets are unique enough to set a film apart as distinctly Thai. SW breaks from this standard and is set within an unspectacular high rise building. This change of scenery has led to several assumptions by the film makers. First SW is more akin to an amusement ride than a standard horrorcomedy story. Basically the coherence of the plot arch is sacrificed for over the top visuals and slap stick comedy. The assumption is that the audience will give up all expectations and surrender to the ride. As hinted at above this is either wonderful or dreadful depending on taste. SW offers no commentary on life people or the human condition. Rather the film throws the audience into an absurd situation confronted by caricatures of stock characters. The effect is a fast paced horror comedy devoid of any seriousness. Second the use of cheap SFX and CGI is clearly done for humor value. The assumption here is that the audience will embrace the over the top absurdity and appropriately poor effects. This assumption is again open to criticism. Some may find the poor effects bog down the film and remove any sense of reality. Others like myself enjoyed the humor of the purposeful low quality.The film as a whole is well paced competently shot and technically professional. The characters as mentioned above are caricatures of well known stock types. The benefit is that the brief character development needed allows for more action oriented sequences. The drawback is that this film offers very little new in the department of zombie fighters. On the whole SW is not trying to break new ground or provide clever innovation. Rather this is a film that exploits highly visual Thai humor within the context of a zombie story. If one enjoys their horror with a hearty helping of incoherent absurdity then this is a film to be sought out.On a personal note I will definitely be recommending this film to friends. The style of humor topics of mockery and goofy gory action make this a film that is enjoyable by a diverse audience. This is a much better than average pizza and beer movie night film. 6.5 of 10 stars.".

The ending is ridiculous which even the characters acknowledge and actually have a good chuckle at the viewers expense. The wonderfully wacky gags costumes and characters are as entertaining as the over the top situations they get plunked into.

The budget must have been decent because there's no shortage of blood body parts and exploding heads. There are a couple of zombie variations I wont spoil that are done in cgi though that let things down a bit as the cgi is pretty much on the same level as something you'd expect in Ali McBeal.The major problem though with Sars Wars is the writing is bad. Really really bad. The comedy in Sars Wars is a horrible mishmash of parody self mockery and 4th wall breaking. Also there isn't a single original element in this film. I mean every zombie movie rips off Dawn of the Dead but... Wild Zero? Anaconda? Anyway If you are zombie movie fan the action is there and you'll have some fun in trying to spot every reference but you'll have a hard time overlooking the terrible humor.".

We fastforward to the present and meet a group of college kids heading to the long abandoned convent to spray paint fraternity letters. The mix of characters is so over the top you can't help but love them. Not a single role is taken 100 seriously and it's obvious that this movie is going to be fun.Our college friends make it to the convent. Unfortunately they are busted by two dopesmoking cops. I want nothing more than to go into detail about this scene but it would ruin a surprise cameo that is beyond hilarious. As the group's bad luck continues they realize they have left their entire bag of weed at the convent and must return. From here gore galore and hilarity ensues.The plot is simple enough and the movie is very funny not to mention gory as all get out. We get a simply wonderful cameo from Adrienne Barbeau whose performance in John Carpenter's The Fog' is treasured by countless horror fans and generally decent production values given the budget.

Now the version of the movie I just got claims to be the full uncut version which would make sense because most of the reviews I have read say they wish the movie was more gory. This movie was plenty gory at least enough to keep my slaughter appetite in check. Also look for Adrienne Barbou kicking serious butt in the last 15 minutes of the movie. 710 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of fun horror movies like The Evil Dead From Beyond and Demons or even Sleepaway Camp 2 Unhappy Campers I find today's multiplexes a barren wasteland when it comes to frenzied hilarious goreandviolence filled fright flicks. I'm forced to choke down pale simulacrums like Valentine Dracula 2000 and Urban Legends Final Cut in theaters while voraciously rewatching the Herschell Gordon LewisCoffin Joe catalog at home. I'm a sad horror junkie aching for a fix.That's why viewing The Convent in a theater packed with likeminded goreophiles was a near orgasmic experience. Finally a modern horror flick that aims for all the right targets hitting most of them and shoveling a bucketload of entertainment down my parched killernun hungry gullet.The Convent tells the tale of some dopey fraternity types breaking into an abandoned nunnery only to encounter carnagehungry ghouls fey devil worshippers and oodles of cool imagery skin peeling and decapitations. When's the last time they made a movie about that kind of stuff that wasn't crap? What's even more impressive is that this movie is funny hilariously so and on purpose. In fact not only is The Coven better than most recent horror movies it's funnier than most socalled comedies.  I dare anyone with a sick sense of humor not to fall in love with the destinedtobelegendary flashback scene of evil nuns running amuck through a 1950s Catholic School.The dialog is great too In retrospect I can think of only one stupid line that made me cringe concerning saving one's virginity for pasty poser Marylyn Manson and delivered by a capable amiable cast who turn stereotypical roles into likable characterizations. I expected to hate the stoner womanizer and the Goth chick lead but the actors playing them were so good that I ended up loving them. There's even two characters who seem to be straight out of those Saturday Night Live Goth Talk sketches but they are funny and I was actually looking forward to seeing more of them! Throw in Coolio and Bill Mosely ChopTop in Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 as dopesnatching college cops and Adrienne Barbeau as a legendary DemoNun slayer and you've got an affair to remember!Yet another thing that endeared me to this flick was the fact that it was obviously made by knowledgeable horror fans but unlike similar but far inferior projects like The Dead Hate the Living or The Dead Next Door they don't chuck obvious aren'twecoolwinkwink genre references at you. The Convent has got subtle references to The Beyond Zombie and others I'm sure I missed plus a Sixteen Candles gag! What more could you ask for?Well I would've asked for more gore. Except for the numerous outstanding beheadings and subsequent squirting neck stumps most of the demonattacks are shot in a shakycam distorted style that makes it hard to see the details. If I was prone to cliches I might use the words hyperkinetic or frenetic to describe the film's style but I'm not so I won't. Still this movie has much more splatsticky maulings than any other flick on the market today and the demon makeup is unique and creative. This movie even makes dayglow colors look cool something Joel Schumaker couldn't do despite his huge Batman  Robin budget. Another minor complaint is that the movie is almost too fast paced and seems hurried and choppy in places. The kickass opening scene in which a gal blows away some pious pussfaces to the chords of Lesley's Gore's immortal You Don't Own Me is edited like a movie trailer and the film's climax seems rushed. Instead of a slambang explosive finale we're treated to some indecipherable computer effects that seem to be inserted as a placeholder until real effects became available. But those are minor caveats. Sure this is no Dead Alive or ReAnimator but it is superior to most other recent horror offerings in every department script cast makeup effects you name it.The fact that this momentous motion picture cannot find a national theatrical distributor proves how out of touch some movie studios are with horror fans. I'm sure no dime would be spared to promote another braindead I Know What You Did Last Summer sequel. So catch this movie wherever and whenever you can preferably in a theater full of people. You'll be oh so glad you did.".

The very cool and moodsetting opening sequence shows a young girl gunning down a bunch of nuns and a priest before setting fire to the conventboarding school they're living in. The urban legend says that this girl  Christine  went insane after a forced abortion and that the convent is haunted by the restless souls of the nuns ever since. Now 40 years later a group of crazy college students breaks into the abandoned convent to play fraternity jokes but soon they get possessed by demons in nuns' clothes and they're recruited to assist in performing virginsacrifices to Satan almighty. There's few tension or atmosphere but the script luckily enough inserts a lot of OTThumor and ingenious ideas a bunch of unbelievably clumsy devilworshipers! that makes this routine horror flick worth watching. The makeup effects are quite grotesque and nasty with blood spurting out of every body hole and heads that are chopped off by the dozen. The dark and ramshackle convent makes an excellent horror location and the nuncostumes are really terrific. The true heroine of this film is Adrienne Barbeau The Fog Escape from N.Y as the skilled demonkiller who comes to save the day. There equally are splendid cameo appearances for rapper Coolio and Bill Mosely House of 1.000 Corpses. The Convent isn't exactly fundamental viewing but it's good and unscrupulous horrorentertainment that fans will surely appreciate.".

This has become a big problem for the modern genre with the recent wave of remakes. The Convent isn't a remake by name but it could easily be a remake of the eighties classic Night of the Demons as the basic plots are more or less identical  but at least enough of it has been changed to ensure that it gets away with being a different film. This is how remakes should be done! Anyway anyone that has seen the aforementioned eighties horror will recognise this story instantly. The film begins with a cool sequence that sees a young girl brutally execute a bunch of nuns with a shotgun. Fast forward fifteen years and a bunch of school kids are planning to break into the convent where it all happened to see if it really is haunted by the dead nuns...It has to be said that this film isn't a piece of high quality filmmaking. The acting is largely ridiculous and the special effects are so bad that they make the majority of the cast look on par with some of the greatest performances of all time. However the film was clearly never meant to be seen as great horror and thankfully it does work as a fun trashy horror comedy. There's always plenty going on and the film never really has time to get boring which is certainly to its credit. The majority of the characters are rather dull and this is not helped by the fact that the most interesting one is killed off towards the beginning but the loss of her presence is somewhat made up for the appearance of a couple of bumbling 'Satanists' that provides the laughs. The film also features a few cameo appearances we've got rapper Coolio and Bill Moseley as a couple of coppers and even better Adrienne Barbeau as motorcycle riding demon killer. Overall I really wouldn't recommend anyone goes out of their way to see this film but it's fun enough for what it is and people that enjoy this sort of film surely wont be too disappointed.".

I myself am in love with some of the worst movies ever made and find myself watching them over and over again. If you'd like to know what they are drop me a line.This movie however is miserable. The gore isnt gorey.  The Horror isnt horrifying. The jokes arent funny and are WAY out of place.This movie was given a lot of hype a few years ago. Trailers of the film were all over the web and they were interesting. It was hinted that it was too graphic and violent to be released and  oh please help us find this future horror masterpiece a distributer before it fades away into obscurity and is never seen.  Well maybe that would have been best.This movie semed to steal the plot of Night of the Demons and mix it up with some banal Scooby Doo episode.  They even offer characters ripped out of Saturday Night Live's Goth Talk.It opens in 1959 with the torching of a all girls Catholic schoolconvent by a disgruntled student.  She hauls guns gas and explosives into the chapel and destroys everyone in sight all to the tune of Leslie Gore's You Don't Own Me. Next we are brought into present times with two girls one a simple sorority pledge and her former best friend a goth chick. The goth chick is the only interestingsympathetic character so of course she is the first to go.  Some more 'zany teens show up and all head off to The Convent.  Its become the local urban legend hot spot and makeout point.That is really all you need to know.  You know where its going...you know where it's gone.  Someone gets possessed they in turn possess someone else and so on and so on and so on.  Until someone has to run and get the chick that torched the place 40some years ago in the first place.Its just horrible.  Im so sorry for Coolio who has a sad little cameo in the film.  Im so sorry for Adrienne Barbeau who apparently doesnt have anything else to look foreward to.".

If you like this sequence you will like the rest. Nuttiness ensues involving drugs virgin sacrifices forced abortions gay Satanists ditzy cheerleaders and a pugnacious pug. Oh and Coolio and Bill Moseley make appearances as nogood coppers.It should be noted that this is one of the earlier works from The Gravedancers director Mike Mendez and won the Audience Award at Fantafestival.I have to say that my favorite scene other than the opening was set to the song Dreamweaver where stoner Biff gets high off shrooms and weed hears Jesus talking to him and tries unsuccessfully to mate with a demon.There were incredibly likable characters you watched run around. Goth chick Mo also in The Gravedancers is adorable Stoner dude Biff was hilarious and Young Adult Christine oozed coolness. Unfortunately none of these great characters get more than a half hour screen time. Instead we are stuck with the good girl Clorissa.As for the religious undertones or in this case way overtones it is not preachy or sacrilegious. Mendez comes across as showing what is scary about the idea of having to conform within the confines of a convent.I saw that the SFX received bad comments in other reviews but I felt was okay overall. The makeup was a tad silly in some parts like glow in the dark veins and neon blood. However the prosthetics used to raise the demons foreheads looked realistic and the blood shower scene was cool. The Antichrist birth scene was especially good considering this was low budget and it was only on screen for about one minute.Favorite Quote Satanist asks Are you the spawn of the Devil?

	schema:headline " A huge disappointment";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw a preview for this long before it came out and I thought it was going to be great. The tension and excitement grew as I heard all kinds of great things about it being the next great splattercomedy in the tradition of movies like Evil Dead 2 and DeadAlive over a long period of time during which so many distributors were distancing themselves from it as far as possible. When it finally came out I had chills of excitement going up my spine as I rented it and finally took it home to watch. When the movie was over I was in a rage. It wasn't simply a disappointment. It was the ultimate letdown. A couple years later I rented it again to see if I might like it more now but it was the same bad movie. It had some great moments but this movie is all about style and hitormiss humor. Some of the gore scenes are really entertaining but aside from the occasional jokes that work there's really nothing going for it. I knew from the start not to take it too seriously but what let me down about it was the low quality of the screenplay more than anything else. It just wasn't very good. The Convent tries so hard to be funny and match up to the standards of the greater splattercomedies of Peter Jackson and Sam Raimi but it often fails miserably as anything other than another dumb horrorcomedy that would probably make people laugh at the unintentional rather than the material that strains to be funny. Some scenes were right on the mark to be fair but I found this to be an overhyped waste of time and energy. I actually feel that if it weren't for the postColumbine political climate against gory movies at the time as well as its respectably antipreppie subject matter this would have done very well at the box office with only a few slight changes to the script which is no compliment. If you dig anything that's cheezy with a lot of gore by all means this is a film you would like. I even like movies like that much more than boring romantic comedies and other mainstream drivel. Maybe I might be being too harsh with The Convent but I like what I like and I didn't like this.".

The tension and excitement grew as I heard all kinds of great things about it being the next great splattercomedy in the tradition of movies like Evil Dead 2 and DeadAlive over a long period of time during which so many distributors were distancing themselves from it as far as possible. When it finally came out I had chills of excitement going up my spine as I rented it and finally took it home to watch. When the movie was over I was in a rage. It wasn't simply a disappointment. It was the ultimate letdown. A couple years later I rented it again to see if I might like it more now but it was the same bad movie. It had some great moments but this movie is all about style and hitormiss humor. Some of the gore scenes are really entertaining but aside from the occasional jokes that work there's really nothing going for it. I knew from the start not to take it too seriously but what let me down about it was the low quality of the screenplay more than anything else. It just wasn't very good. The Convent tries so hard to be funny and match up to the standards of the greater splattercomedies of Peter Jackson and Sam Raimi but it often fails miserably as anything other than another dumb horrorcomedy that would probably make people laugh at the unintentional rather than the material that strains to be funny. Some scenes were right on the mark to be fair but I found this to be an overhyped waste of time and energy. I actually feel that if it weren't for the postColumbine political climate against gory movies at the time as well as its respectably antipreppie subject matter this would have done very well at the box office with only a few slight changes to the script which is no compliment. If you dig anything that's cheezy with a lot of gore by all means this is a film you would like. I even like movies like that much more than boring romantic comedies and other mainstream drivel. Maybe I might be being too harsh with The Convent but I like what I like and I didn't like this.";

However even without knowing anything about the characters or story lines I found that I enjoyed this movie a lot and will probably now start watching the shows reruns. The movie starts off tens of thousands of years in the past where an alien life form is roaming in underground caves. Fast forward to the present and that same life form is unearthed by some kids in Texas. No one knows what killed this boy and the firemen sent down to save him. Or maybe someone does know. Enter Special Agents Fox Mulder David Duchovny and Dana Scully Gillian Anderson. A seemlingly unconnected terrorist bombing is linked with the mysterious deaths in Texas and lead Mulder and Scully all over the world to figure out this global conspiracy. Who knows about this alien life form? And why are they trying so hard to keep it a secret?From what I've been told a lot of the regulars on the TV show make an appearance in the movie. But as I said earlier even without knowing who these people are the movie itself is good enough to stand on its own. What I found I liked the most and the reason I'll start watching the show is the interaction between Duchovny and Anderson. After 5 years together these two work perfectly as a team. They know each other so well you feel the chemistry and tension between them. The supporting cast was strong and I liked the idea that an entire alien race is being hidden from the world by a bunch of old white men. The story itself while again from what I hear doesn't really conclude any plot points from the show nor start any new ones manages to stand by itself. The scenery was terrific especially the opening sequence in the underground caves. What I was disappointed with was it seemed as if Duchovny was in the movie a lot more than Anderson. It was as if he was the star of the film and she was a supporting member. The story seemed to revolve around him and she was there to play off of. I wish that Chris Carter the series writer and creator and screenwriter for this film would have made her more of an equal. The other problem I had was that while the plot was good at times it wasn't explained as much as it could have been. The reason for the coverup wasn't made as clear as it could have been at least in my mind.Whether you're a fan or not The XFiles Fight the Future is a good way to spend a couple hours in a nice air conditioned environment.".

But putting the movie in context with the series evaluating it as an episode between the seasons forces me to acknowledge the flaws that it contains. As I've already mentioned this is an exciting fastpaced story bigger than any mythology episode before it as it is essentially a twohour mythology episode. Rob Bowman my favorite XFiles director does an awesome job. Getting chased by black helicopters at night through a cornfield and escaping from homicidal aliens in an enormous alien spaceship are things the series could never dreamed of doing with a television series budget. The drama dialogue and action are great. Martin Landau does a wonderful job as Kurtzweil Mulder's informant for the movie. I love the scene transitions in the movie. A lot of them are done in a creative way that informs as well as entertains. What brings the movie down a couple of points are some inconsistencies like Scully not getting caught in the autopsy room the patient bee that can stay underneath Scully's collar all the way from a cornfield in Texas to Mulder's apartment in D.C. many hours later. And of course the bad guys that somehow know that Scully is going to be stung by the bad bee and have an ambulance and false EMT guys at the ready and intercept Mulder's 911. Even in the XFiles that whole sequence with the bee sting was too farfetched to be believable. An interesting thing learned from the audio commentary is that Chris Carter wanted to give the fans a kiss between Mulder and Scully but not a real kiss. So he considers the nearkiss in the hallway plus Mulder doing mouthtomouth resuscitation on Scully to equal a kiss between the two. Odd thinking methinks. The XFiles movie is not a letdown and a definite thrill ride for fans of the show. Just a few unbelievable plot inconsistencies makes it not the best that the XFiles has to offer.".

	schema:headline " As good as it possibly could be";
	schema:reviewBody "The XFiles movie really is as good a big screen adaptation as you could possibly hope for.It helps that it's entirely controlled by the people behind the series and that the programme had cinematic qualities in the first place. On repeat viewings however the story is revealed to be thin and lacking in incident. Its need to tie into events of the series makes it not wholly satisfying as a standalone vehicle though it should still be understandable to those that have never seen an episode.David Duchovny as Mulder seems surprisingly at ease in his limited way while Martin Landau is good as far as plot devices go. Gillian Anderson is unfortunately encouraged to overstate her lines particularly in the beginning while a cameo by The Lone Gunmen is perhaps the only indulgence that would be lost on nonfans.There are inevitable concessions to the cinema format of course. Not the touted mild use of expletives which happened from time to time on TV anyway. But the alien presence that mutates to owe a debt to Ridley Scott's Alien or the nearkiss between the two leads. Thankfully the first point actually makes a logical sense and carries the story forward. The second is something that was also long overdue and silly that it took so long. For two people who obviously feel about each other the way Mulder and Scully do to go five years without even kissing is stretching credulity.Ultimately though it lacks any clear focus for a casual film audience and flits repetitively from action sequence to sloppy exposition and back again throughout its duration. Creator Chris Carter like Gene Roddenberry with Star Trek before him is not the smoothest writer of his own series though he does adequately most of the time. Worst example is the opening MulderScully scene which is laughably trite and there are plenty more examples of Carter's trademark purple prose. Yet it does have a beginning middle and end and can be watched backtoback with a TV episode with no noticeable jumps in style. In that sense then it is a most successful bigscreen adaptation of a television series.Hardcore XFile fans will be inclined to award an extra mark to the total then. But for a noncommittal audience this is a 6 as they would have no idea from watching this that the frail fagsmoking pensioner is the series' major villain.".

	onyx:emotionText "The XFiles movie really is as good a big screen adaptation as you could possibly hope for.It helps that it's entirely controlled by the people behind the series and that the programme had cinematic qualities in the first place. On repeat viewings however the story is revealed to be thin and lacking in incident. Its need to tie into events of the series makes it not wholly satisfying as a standalone vehicle though it should still be understandable to those that have never seen an episode.David Duchovny as Mulder seems surprisingly at ease in his limited way while Martin Landau is good as far as plot devices go. Gillian Anderson is unfortunately encouraged to overstate her lines particularly in the beginning while a cameo by The Lone Gunmen is perhaps the only indulgence that would be lost on nonfans.There are inevitable concessions to the cinema format of course. Not the touted mild use of expletives which happened from time to time on TV anyway. But the alien presence that mutates to owe a debt to Ridley Scott's Alien or the nearkiss between the two leads. Thankfully the first point actually makes a logical sense and carries the story forward. The second is something that was also long overdue and silly that it took so long.

	schema:reviewBody "There are two types of people in this world Those that watch XFiles and those that do not. I like many other critics who walked into The XFiles movie fall into the latter category. But it doesn't matter because I don't believe that there are any real twists in the plot or revelations like the extended title implies there may be. In fact I think that even the strict fans of the television show may be a bit in the dark by the time the credits start to roll. I got lost about 23 of the way through but I still had a fun time.Scully and Mulder the two FBI Agents I think from the famous television show of the same name make their bigscreen debut in a featurelength theatrical film release that plays much more like a clever science fiction film than a stupid one. I do not claim to be a huge fan of the sciencefiction genre  I like softer scifi such as The Terminator  but I admire the hard scifi films that make an effort to reach those of us who many not be the most enthusastic scifi geeks. The XFiles has a harder task  it has to reach those who not only have never seen the show but also those who may not love scifi too much and it does a good job. I admire it above all else for being able to do this.It strikes a chord that good scifi films have struck in the past. It gets down to the meaty bits although sometimes the plot left me in the dark and the ending started to get a bit crazy which lowered my overall pleasure regarding the film. It's like a mystery set in the world of UFOs and alien encounters. It is at times quite chilling in a subtle way and at other times quite humorous and fun and thrilling.It starts off with a boy falling into a pit and being attacked by hundreds of small sluglike creatures that crawl into his eye sockets and over his eyes don't bring the kids to this one. More people enter into the pit in an illfated attempt to rescue the boy and they wind up being knocked unconscious or put into a deep sleep like the boy. The bodies are all transported to a hospital and that same hospital later blows up after Scully Gillian Anderson and Mulder David Duchovny are unable to stop an implanted terrorist bomb from detonating inside a coke maching.But then Mulder is told by a mysterious man outside a bar Martin Landau that the bomb was never attempted to be defused. It was all an elaborate coverup to hide the bodies of the pit victims. Mulder shrugs off the old man at first before he realizes that the man used to be a friend of his father's and that he has some interesting true stories to tell.The XFiles intrigued me kept me interested for the most part and gave me a few good chill sequences and yet I haven't seen a single fulllength episode of the FOX TV show only little tidbits here and there. From what I can tell from my short experiences with the television show this film carries a much more mainstream feel to it. I don't really take an interest in TV shows because I find them pretty corny. But The XFiles movie wasn't that corny.The sight of the aliens themselves is only touched lightly and the secret promised to be revealed by the trailers and ads isn't. I assume most people thought it would be in regards to Mulder's alienabducted sister from his childhood. But Duchovny is very interesting and often humorous in his role and I would like to see him in more films than he is in. Gillian Anderson is a bit weak in her role  in fact my mother saw her on stage in London and reported back to me that she was so bored by her dull lifeless performance that she nearly left the theater. But Duchovny carries along the film by himself and the film has some good sequences. Overall even people who have never laid eyes on the TV show will be able to appreciate this.3.55 stars.John Ulmer".

The XFiles had so many different fans I have to admit that I was a fan not so much to the extent as many others were but I enjoyed the show. However I think because my friend rubbed it in my face so much of how much this show was the best television show to ever hit the air waves I steered clear of the movie. But I was renting movies the other day and came across The XFiles and figured to just give the movie a shot it's been how many years since the show ended? But I watched it last night and I liked the movie. I think the only thing is is this was a movie that was definitely made for the fans and no one else because if you didn't watch the show you won't get into the movie.Mulder and Scully are on the case again after they learn of a deadly virus that is killing off the planet. Of course the government is covering it up making it seem like it's more of a terrorist or a horrible flu. Mulder wants to make the truth known but Scully has just given up that is until she is attacked by a bug carrying the virus and Mulder will not give up on her. He saves her but she needs more strength if they are to make it out of this situation alive.The XFiles the movie is a cool sci fi film if you are not a fan or didn't watch the series there is a small chance you'll get into the film. But this was a definite treat for the fans this is the film they wanted and as much as I hate this saying The XFiles is just an extended episode with a bigger budget but it's still a cool film. I liked it Mulder and Scully always provide perfect entertainment and I just love Mulder going into his infamous speeches of the truth is out there so over dramatic but you gotta love his passion in it. The XFiles is worth the look it's a fun film and is cool scifi.710".

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING Spoilers ahead throughout this review.There's a speech Fox Mulder makes at the end of the Xfiles movie which goes along the lines of Well here we are again we had the evidence in our hands and now we've lost it. I'm sick of it happening again I don't want to do this any more. I felt like applauding at that point.For me that speech was not only this film but the whole concept of the Xfiles in a nutshell.Nothing of any real consequence occurs in this film nothing at all. It's simply two FBI agents occasionally being chased or chasing someone or looking puzzled. They sometimes find physical evidence of a government conspiracy to do something terrible but the evidence is without exception snatched away or destroyed or forgotten by the writers. Sometimes we might even see the conspirators talking about these forthcoming terrible events in very vague terms. The terrible events never ever happened in the series. However I was hopeful that with a cinema budget they might stretch to showing an alien invasion or two. Perhaps the writers had only been teasing the audience until they had the money to give their intended cataclysm justice on the big screen. Alas all we get is an exploding building destroying evidence an exploding car destroying evidence and some snow falling into an empty hole. Nothing you wouldn't find in a TV Movie.The dialogue is awful too Mulder is continuously told that he's barely scratched the surface of the conspiracy. I'd wager a good amount of money that he's actually gone right through the surface a long time ago and exhausted all the plot we're ever going to get out of Chris Carter. When we find out what this conspiracy involves it's actually a very very dull mix of Alien and V about extraterrestrials conquering the earth with the help of ambitious humans with a view to feeding on human bodies. Doctor Who also used this plot several times over in the 60s and 70s.In the XFiles essentially nothing happens to the characters to their status or their plans and for the worst of reasons because the producers want to string this franchise out for as long as they can make money from it. The aliens will never invade but neither will Mulder ever prove to anyone that they exist I can tell you that right now. I can also tell you that if all this is ever resolved in a final film or episode it will turn out to be a disappointing copout.One of the other reviewers on IMDB compared the XFiles film to Hitchcock but Hitchcock actually satisfied his audience by showing the little guy cleverly fighting back and eventually triumphing over the dark conspiracy against him. There was methodical progression there was movement there was excitement tension and engagement. Hitchcock films are thrilling because you believe the hero might win or the villain might kill him. You know the conclusion is just round the corner whatever happens.In the XFiles we know that Mulder will never be killed the evil conspirators say they will not kill him for fear of making him a martyr. Unfortunately we also know that Mulder will never win because then they couldn't make a sequel to this singleissue drama. There is no thrill in the XFiles because the basic premise of the film and indeed series its ground rules demand that ultimately nothing happens for the sake of extending the franchise. It's just aimless wandering.Sorry to be crude but the XFiles is like perpetual Coitus Interruptus.The only vaguely memorable scene is Martin Landau ping in an alley.".

	schema:reviewBody "Assigned to a bomb threat on a Federal building Scully and Mulder find the bomb in another building.  Ordered out by the agent in charge the bomb explodes destroying much of the building and killing 4 people.  Without any suspects the authorities look for someone to blame and focus on Mulder.  To clear himself Mulder investigates a tip from Alvin Kurtzweil that the bomb was to cover the fact that 3 of those killed were already dead. Investigating Scully discovers evidence that points to a viral infection by aliens orchestrated by a group of powerful men.Although I had stopped watching series long before it finally ended I still wanted to see this film.  The basic plot is the element I've always preferred in the series  the bigger picture of the alien conspiracy as opposed to the oneepisode wonder of freaks or monsters etc.  The film gets off to a great start  the early scene where a man calmly waits for the bomb 2 feet in front of him to explode to destroy the alien evidence is creepy and tells the audience immediately just how important the contents of the building are.  After this point it keeps the momentum fairly well but doesn't manage to ever feel like it's not something we've seen before in the series.This might not be a problem for most people but for those who have issues or are totally unaware of the series then it is easy just to see this as part of the series rather than a stand alone movie experience.  That said it does have elements that show it to be of a grander scale and it does fill out the screen quite well.  The best thing it does is manage to have a constant uneasy feeling over the lengths that the conspiracy will go to  whether it's the bombing or the sealing of a scientist in a tomb it all feels scary.  The downside of this is that the film can't capitalise on this as really this feeling works best as part of an ongoing series than just a film which requires an ending.There are a few funny moments Mulder taking a leak on ID4 is the best but the film does keep the drama up quite well.  In terms of performances Duchovny can do this stuff in his sleep and at least is open to a little mocking of Mulder in his performance.  Anderson seems to have been a little short changed and is treated as a secondary character  she spends a lot of the film shouting gruff instructions don't think just pick up the phone and make it happen' etc.  Support from the usual X Files characters are all good although with some of them you do wonder why they bothered for all the screen time they had.Overall this film will be liked by fans and should do the job for those like me who take a passing interest in the series.  As a film it is not perfect and is perhaps a little too familiar for my tastes but seen as a big screen episode of the series it works just fine.".

For seven years they were the centerpiece of what is likely to be remembered as the show of the 90's.  Drama comedy they did it all well and different.  Season 8 and 9 are not in that league due to the reduced presence of Duchovny and Anderson and a burned out core writing staff but it was still better than most of its rivals.  The movie essentially can serve as a cliffnote to the first five years although I highly recommend buying the season box sets and start from the beginning.  For the film itself keep in mind that the XFiles in the end was about the journey of Mulder and Scully to each other and not really about conspiracies or aliens.

That's a pretty obvious answer and one that we didn't know was plausible at the time Somebody had been protecting Mulder and apparently that person does so in this film.

	schema:reviewBody "The first scene we see Mulder and Scully in involves a building being blown up. This is the first of many scenes where it becomes evident that Chris Carter wrote this film around the budget instead of using the big budget to improve the film. The script is also problematic for other reasons not that Chris Carter was ever the most talented XFiles writer in terms of dialogue see Vince Gilligan or Darin Morgan but some of this movie seems extraordinarily cheap and speedwritten Carter essentially had to write this film and his season 5 episodes roughly at the same time and the result is some really embarrassing moments.The whole movie has a sort of 'greatest hits' feel cramming the Lone Gunmen in just for the sake of having them there revisiting questions but not answering them and bringing back stuff we remember from mythology episodes just for the fun of it. This was the first step into REALLY muddling the mythology arc the series became famous for although I for one thought season 6 was exceptionally strong but the show's mytharc dwindled fast in quality and by seasons 7 and 9 it was the standalone episodes that remained memorable and entertaining.To its credit this film is wellmade and excellently scored and the acting is generally solid. There are good parts here and there but mostly it feels like a sellout. The mythology arc was seriously harmed by this film and there's no telling if it would've played out better without it. Ultimately this movie was so worried about satisfying an audience Mulder  Scully nearly kiss! Oh the excitement!  sarcasm  it forgot to function as a film.510".

This is the first of many scenes where it becomes evident that Chris Carter wrote this film around the budget instead of using the big budget to improve the film. The script is also problematic for other reasons not that Chris Carter was ever the most talented XFiles writer in terms of dialogue see Vince Gilligan or Darin Morgan but some of this movie seems extraordinarily cheap and speedwritten Carter essentially had to write this film and his season 5 episodes roughly at the same time and the result is some really embarrassing moments.The whole movie has a sort of 'greatest hits' feel cramming the Lone Gunmen in just for the sake of having them there revisiting questions but not answering them and bringing back stuff we remember from mythology episodes just for the fun of it. This was the first step into REALLY muddling the mythology arc the series became famous for although I for one thought season 6 was exceptionally strong but the show's mytharc dwindled fast in quality and by seasons 7 and 9 it was the standalone episodes that remained memorable and entertaining.To its credit this film is wellmade and excellently scored and the acting is generally solid. There are good parts here and there but mostly it feels like a sellout. The mythology arc was seriously harmed by this film and there's no telling if it would've played out better without it. Ultimately this movie was so worried about satisfying an audience Mulder  Scully nearly kiss! Oh the excitement!  sarcasm  it forgot to function as a film.510";

The movie demanded an extensive knowledge of previous data places characters and events in order to be fully understood and even with the blanks filled in no amount of spectacular visuals could make up for the paperthin plot. I suppose that some of the most notorious scenes of the film no need to mention you know which ones were big payoffs for fans but the sad truth was that this was just an extended episode i.e. it did not stand alone on its own two feet as a film and it should have never reached the big screen just aired as a special. I believe that even if a film is based on previous material it should always be a self contained story that can be enjoyed at least for the most part also by the uninitiated but this is clearly not the case here.So I can't really judge the significance of this film for those who love the show and I know there's a lot out there so fair enough if they're satisfied this movie was clearly just for them.

It's vulgarized.  I'm not a big fan of the original TV series although I suppose over time I've seen most of the available episodes.  Some of them are pretty dull. But the writers as a collective whole had respect for the real fans.  The plots are often hard to follow and sometimes don't make sense but the real interest in any case was in the relationship between Mulder and Scully as well as between the two of them and the mystery they were trying to unravel. It was all very subdued.  Lots of dark rooms with flashlight beams waving around.  A bit of fx with bumps running around under someone's skin but not much of that.  And most endearing a good deal of lowkey humor.  But because not much is made of the comedy you have to watch carefully for it. In one episode Mulder confronts a selfproclaimed mind reader thrusts his head forward and says Read this thought.  The mindreader raises his eyebrows and snaps back So's your old man.  The exchange is over in a few seconds.  All of the humor was rather like that.  And it's missing in this movie which takes itself much too seriously and tries to make up for these kinds of crabwise quotidian exchanges by an expanded scale.  A building in the movie blows up in tremendous fireballs.  Cars actually  can you believe this?  smash into one another when they crash.  Special effects abound in a way they didn't in the series overcoming the mind boggling it with their monstrousness a huge space ship a hole in the ice!The plot is as silly as any of the sillier ones in the series.  A government conspiracy revolving around a virus that was stored by the original aliens who inhabited the earth  am I getting this right?  and it winds up with Mulder stalking across the infinite expanse of antarctic snow and happening to fall into the only available hidden threefootwide hole that leads down through three or four layers until he finds himself lying exhausted at the bottom of a thirty foot chute in the ice.  Does he try to get out?  Not on your life or on his either.  He digs deeper which only makes sense as long as you're trying to come out in China so your can order General Tsao's chicken in General Tsao's Original Chinese Restaurant.The acting.  Dealing with Gillian Anderson first.  She has a skewed kind of beauty her face from certain angles resembling a Renaissance sculpture and from others an ordinarily beautiful Hausfrau.  I find myself wondering what her molars look like.  Her figure is odd as well no neck to speak of and a muscularity that bespeaks Bronco Nagurski.  I don't mean that to sound worse than it does.  She's an extremely attractive woman.  Love that nose which reminds me of an overhanging ledge I once took a photo of in the Blue Ridge Mountains.  Her acting is adequate both here and in the series but it's impossible to tell what sort of legs her career will have because her range is necessarily so constricted.  David Duchovny I am assured by multiple sources is a big hearthrob.  His face has been described as panty melting.  Okay  I don't hold that against him despite my jealousy.  He seems like a nice guy.  I'd like to play poker with him.  But as in Anderson's case the role restricts him.  I can't tell whether he's an actor or not.  I've never seen either of them in anything except their series.I genuinely believe that fans of the series might as well stick with the series.  A few miles of rough road now and then but it's a superior TV entity.  This movie is not much more than exploitation of the fans' interest.".

Magaly Solier has a great performance and her exotic beauty is impressive. The translation of the title of this film to English The Milk of Sorrow is ridiculous since the correct translation would be The Frightened Teat.

	schema:reviewBody "Fausta the young Peruvian of Indian extraction is suffering from a strange malady. When taken to a clinic to be examined the doctor examining her determines she has a growth in her vagina he compares it to having a potato growing up inside her. The uncle explains to the doctor it is a condition deemed to be 'the milk of sorrow' something that was passed from her mother as she breastfed Fausta when she was an infant. Many women were violated by the rebel groups that preyed on the Indian communities. In order to prevent being violated Fausta is carrying a potato in her vagina something the science man cannot begin to imagine.As the story begins we see her with her mother who is singing a strange song in Quechuan. Nothing seems to indicate she is suffering from an illness but as the singing stops the lady dies. Fausta is shocked when she realizes what has just happened. After accepting the fact about her mother she must bury her. The uncle has already started to dig a spot in back of the house to serve as a tomb. Fausta does not have a lot of money. A visit to the undertakers prove to be useless for she cannot afford to even buy the cheapest kind of funeral. In spite of that Fausta and the women relatives prepare the body by wrapping it in a sort of a shroud.With the problem still at hand Fausta is engaged as a maid in the home of a lady pianist. Her instructions are not to let any strangers in the house. The place is adjacent to what seems to be a public market. Fausta a shy woman is amazed by what she finds in the fancy home but she never gets close to the lady of the house. The breaking of a string of pearls brings the maid to help the lady who promises to give Fausta the pearls eventually. The only person that is closer to the girl is the gardener a man that at times ogles the young girl with more than necessary but nothing happens between them.We witness a few garish weddings happening at the compound where Fausta's uncle lives. The family makes extra money by preparing these weddings catering them and providing entertainment. Sometimes Fausta helps serve the guests. After Fausta gets the pearls her desire to bury the mother comes a possibility. We watch her and the relatives as they travel to a desert near the Pacific. Fausta knows exactly where will be her mother's resting place. The final shots of the film are full of symbolism. Fausta finds a small pot where two potatoes have flowered into a small plant.Claudia LLosa the Peruvian creator of this film sets her film among the poor classes in a Lima suburb populated by the destitute. The place is not a ghetto by any means the only thing in common with that would be the poor housing where the people in the story live. The area is located in hills with steep stairs that are used by the locals to come to town. Fausta is a symbol of the oppressed classes by representing a small part of that culture. Ignorance and superstition are rampant among the population where even a doctor is questioned when it is evident Fausta has something that will lead to a bigger problem if not treated properly.In Magaly Solier Ms. LLosa has found a girl that personifies the type of individual she is supposed to be. Not having seen this actress before or for that matter any of the cast seems to be a triumph for the director in getting the results she wanted to present. The character of Fausta is an enigma to most viewers. She is an aloof presence in the film. It is through her eyes the story is seen.Natasha Braier the cinematographer captured the dreary locales in which the film is set with somber reverence. The music is by Selma Mutal relying in the type of musical influence from the group at the center of the story. Ms. LLosa's film is highly feminine showing an innate talent for great things to come.".

The only person that is closer to the girl is the gardener a man that at times ogles the young girl with more than necessary but nothing happens between them.We witness a few garish weddings happening at the compound where Fausta's uncle lives. The family makes extra money by preparing these weddings catering them and providing entertainment. Sometimes Fausta helps serve the guests. After Fausta gets the pearls her desire to bury the mother comes a possibility. We watch her and the relatives as they travel to a desert near the Pacific. Fausta knows exactly where will be her mother's resting place. The final shots of the film are full of symbolism. Fausta finds a small pot where two potatoes have flowered into a small plant.Claudia LLosa the Peruvian creator of this film sets her film among the poor classes in a Lima suburb populated by the destitute. The place is not a ghetto by any means the only thing in common with that would be the poor housing where the people in the story live. The area is located in hills with steep stairs that are used by the locals to come to town. Fausta is a symbol of the oppressed classes by representing a small part of that culture. Ignorance and superstition are rampant among the population where even a doctor is questioned when it is evident Fausta has something that will lead to a bigger problem if not treated properly.In Magaly Solier Ms. LLosa has found a girl that personifies the type of individual she is supposed to be. Not having seen this actress before or for that matter any of the cast seems to be a triumph for the director in getting the results she wanted to present. The character of Fausta is an enigma to most viewers. She is an aloof presence in the film. It is through her eyes the story is seen.Natasha Braier the cinematographer captured the dreary locales in which the film is set with somber reverence. The music is by Selma Mutal relying in the type of musical influence from the group at the center of the story. Ms. LLosa's film is highly feminine showing an innate talent for great things to come.";

	schema:reviewBody "I had some really big expectations for The Milk of Sorrow. I mean when was the last time a Peruvian motion picture a movie made in my country by filmmakers from my country won such a prestigious award as the Golden Bear? I expected this film to be something really special something that could make an impact in me and fortunately most members of the audience in the packed theatre I found myself in. The subject matter was undeniable interesting and full of possibilities and director Claudia Llosa could undeniably use this movie to try to affect her audience both emotionally and intellectually.Unfortunately this is not the case. I went with three friends. None of us really enjoyed the film. The rest of the audience? The best description I have of the expressions in their faces when the end credits started to roll is the following wtf? Some of them even left early or the moment the credits started not even waiting to see how had directed or performed in the film. As much as it saddens me The Milk of Sorrow is proof that not only artsy independent movies are masterpieces and that one doesn't always have to agree with the members of a jury giving a supposedly prestigious award.The thing about The Milk of Sorrow is that it's got a premise but that's it. No story. No narrative. It almost seems as if Llosa wanted to start something but didn't know how and instead preferred to chronicle the life of her young protagonist. This might seem all right but all that we're doing is witnessing the way she lives and deals with her problems. The movie goes nowhere. We know she's afraid of going outside of being alone we know she's got a potato inside her vagina acting as some kind tampon and that she believes in the milk of sorrow disease. We've got issues but nothing else. The film almost seems like a documentary in that there's very little narrative to speak of and that it seems more concerned in watching these characters instead of making the audience sympathize with them.Magaly Solier is not a bad actress. Although I didn't enjoy Madeinusa that much either she was pretty good in it but here she's wasted. It's not that she gives a bad performance it's that her character is poorly written. How can one sympathize with her and her situation when Fausta has virtually no personality? She almost seems like a zombie walking through the world barely talking and barely expressing herself. I know there are people like that and I know she's supposed to be traumatized and fearful but that doesn't mean she's stopped being a human being. She is a woman and Llosa is supposed to make the viewer believe in the fact that she's a real woman. But this doesn't happen. I liked when she sang  it's not only a great cultural thing but it also gave a little characterization to Fausta  but I hated the way she was underwritten.I know many people will say I didn't get the movie and that's why I didn't like it. Well I must say I actually got it that's the point. Besides there's not much to get. It's not a terribly complex film which is good. It's a psychological and sociological analysis of the trauma that these people experienced due to Sendero Luminoso and the armed forces and the beliefs they have. It's a very interesting cultural study and it all feels real because it is but that doesn't mean it's a very good film. Maybe if it had been done in the form of a documentary it would have worked better but as a supposed narrative it doesn't really flow because there's no plot to speak of and characters are boring. There are themes and ideas to be sure but does that mean it's got to be an amazing picture? Technically the film's really good I guess. Unlike other Peruvian productions it doesn't look as if the film was shot with a videocamera. The 35 mm film does the movie a lot of good giving it a very dreamy serious look. It's all very realistic but at times it's very beautiful too. Llosa's slowmoving sometimes very still camera is appropriate for the material but the film's pacing is off. I have nothing against slow films actually some of my favorite movies are very slow ones but The Milk of Sorrow is just too slow and for no apparent reason. It definitely gives the movie a dreamy sort of quality but the filmmakers also risk losing their audience. The movie is only 94 minutes long but it surely feels a lot longer. Did the film need to be slow? I don't think so.I really wanted to like The Milk of Sorrow. Technically it's superior to other Peruvian productions and performances are solid but the movie's main problem is that it doesn't work at all as a narrative. There's very little plot to speak of and characters  especially Fausta the protagonist  are zombies. I appreciate what Claudia Llosa tried to do  actually I admire it mainly because from watching the film it's apparent a lot of effort went into the making of the production. But the fact that I admire the filmmakers and what they were trying to do doesn't mean I have to like the movie. Unfortunately although many independent andor artsy movies are really really good a pleasant change from Hollywood's loud and noisy productions not all of them are as good as one would want them to be. La Teta Asustada had lots of potential but sadly it didn't fulfill them. Hopefully Llosa's next film will be superior.".

Here's a film that could sustain its BestForeignFilm AcademyAward nomination on the basis of its cinematography alone. Beautiful in composition and execution La teta asustada The Milk of Sorrow is  from first shots to last  a joy to view.This is a fine thing because the film is a tad slowmoving until we get totally into it.It opens with a beautiful singing set piece of a young woman's mother dying.It ends with that same woman leaning over to enjoy the fragrance of a flowering potato plant.In between the young woman undergoes an visually intoxicating journey from fears of the past to hopes of the future. It's such a beautiful journey that 24 hours after viewing it this writer dreams of viewing it again. !moreLa teta asustada is a story of fact and fable.It's a fact that the young woman's mother was raped during warfare while she was pregnant with the young woman. It's a fact that the mother taught the young woman to create and sing little songs whenever she is frightened. It's also a fact that the young woman is frightened much of the time. She has taken drastic measures to overcome her biggest fear.What is fable is that the young woman's fears were inherited from her mother by suckling that mother's breast milk.The film is full of everyday scenes of how the poor live on the outskirts of Lima Peru. It's also full of scenes that take place inside and on the grounds of the big house where the young woman has gone to work as the night maid.La teta asustada is full of native Peruvian ceremonial courtship and wedding customs beautiful Peruvian song and music and exquisitely composed shots of the Peruvian landscape.Overriding it all however is the tangible tasteable sadness and fear of the young woman. Over the course of 94 gorgeous minutes that sadness and fear is gently soulfully left behind at the seashore in a hospital operating room and at the hands of a gentle gardener who comes to see the beauty in the wonderful simplicity of a flowering potato plant.As with all of our most rewarding film experiences it's difficult to put into words all the emotions and images this film releases in the heart of its viewers.Once you've seen La teta asustada however simple things like pearls potatoes sand and stairways will never look the same to you again. Don't deny yourself these sad simple beautiful pleasures".

As an American living in Lima Peru for 2 years I try hard to immerse myself in the language and culture here  as many expatriates also do. I think native Peruvians may see this film as not having an overwhelming theme or not ending with definitive answers to difficult issues.What I think this film does do very well is give a unique perspective into the life of a class of person that many middle and upper class people are curious about. For me it was a slice of a person's life in which I could experience firsthand alongside the protagonist. It is unlikely that in real life could I visit these same places step into their houses share their conversations and experience their most intimate thoughts.Personally I like the fact that the film does not close with a sense of some deep satisfaction that a difficulty has been resolved and people are now free to live with closure. Often times this can give an audience false assurance that all is well no need to act everything is now OK if the problem can be resolved in the movie it will take care of itself in reality. Instead Llosa gives us a mere slice of life for these Peruvian characters and it is up to the audience to decide if or how to participate solving these issues in reality and those issues are many fold.The budget was not expansive but the true beauty was the characters. This is a movie where I believe Llosa didn't intend to spell everything out but make the viewer have to think and ask questions.".

Facing her mother's death Fausta is forced to overcome her fear and work in the Big House of a limea musician.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie had a truly original plot that at times felt a little unbelievable. The characters themselves were believable and an interesting twist was that half of the movie was in a local dialect rather than Spanish. The protagonist Fausta believes that she is condemned to a life of fear because her mother was raped while she was pregnant with her. This fear was transferred to her from her mother's 'teta asustada' according to Peruvian superstition. Some parts of the movie like her mother's burial are drawn out for longer than they should and do not add to the storyline. The songs that Fausta sings are a nice addition to the soundtrack and add an interesting subplot. It is a movie that I am glad that I watched but I don't think I'll watch it again.".

There are so many aspects to filmmaking that go into producing great art and if a film only hits 5 of those it falls far below even the minimum standard. While I found LTA executed well technically the ONLY reason I give it a 2 instead of a 1 I found the tone selfindulgent and condescending. The characters and indigenous culture are so poorly sketched that even as someone intimately acquainted with Lima and its socioeconomic complications I found I had no empathy or feeling for what should have been a tragic tale. Very poorly written the actors struggle to breathe life into this CORPSE of a script. I felt an abstractnear hatred towards the ignorance and denial portrayed in the film and doubly so towards Llosa for wasting 2hrs of my life AGAIN. I only dipped my toe into her suffocatingly shallow filmmaking because it was nominated for an Oscar. I sorely regret it and am appalled that LTA is being dolledup as though it's on par w Un Prophte or El Secreto de Sus Ojos. I'm an arthouse foreign film junkie but The Hangover was better than this tripe. At least I wasn't tricked into thinking it was good by rave reviews and awards.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie starts out beautifully and heartbreaking with Fausta's mom serenading her in Quechua while she lay in bed dying. During this song she describes the rape she endured while pregnant with Fausta and the death of her husband. These first few minutes are very crucial to the understanding of the movie. Since Fausta's mother was raped while she was still inside her mother the milk of sorrow was passed down to her. The milk of sorrow is defined as the fear that her mother passed down to her while breastfeeding. The movie even goes so far to say that the milk of sorrow is one born without a soul since it's so hidden due to fear. Her mother proceeds to pass away while Fausta serenades her after her mother stops singing. Fausta goes next door where she begins to bleed and a pool of blood between her legs on the ground starts to form. The girls scream out that Fausta is bleeding again  making it seem like this is a normal occurrence. The next scene shows Fausta at the doctor being asked if she's a virgin and she responds that she doesn't know. The nurse explains she has a potato in her vagina and she doesn't want anybody to take it out. The rest of the movie follows Fausta where she must make a few tough decisions. She wants to earn enough money to transport her mother back and have her buried in their smalltown village. However the job she has makes her question whether she is going to continuing living in fear or if she is going to overcome The Milk of Sorrow. Lastly the potato begins to affect her health and she must decide whether to keep it or not. The movie is very heartfelt and unpredictable which makes it that much more enjoyable. I recommend you watch this movie and pay close attention to all the different turns it takes.".

Overall it was an incredibly compelling and rich film though I felt at times it lost its way. Perhaps that was the point.The film begins abruptly with a story of sexual violence and atrocious violations of a woman's rights. This would be jarring enough on its own but the movie presents the story through the song of an aging dying woman who lies in her death bed. This opening sets up the rest of the movie a trancelike journey through the hatefilled violencefilled discriminationfilled life of Fausta a poor indigenous woman of Per who's soul has been crushed by the boot of an oppressive past. From one scene to the next the viewer slowly comes to know Fausta piece by piece. However like the pearl necklace that Fausta tries to earn with her voice the picture is never truly completed. I can't say that I liked or enjoyed this movie. I really didn't. It was incredibly painful to sit through and I found myself disgusted and angry at everyone in it. But that is the point. The film is meant to paint a picture of the harsh reality of a society who for centuries upon centuries has been ruled by violence. Everyone in Fausta's life seems to take advantage of her. From her uncle to her employer to the doctor supposedly sworn to heal Fausta is abused used and forgotten. The film is a harsh but accurate depiction of the worst side of humanity and while it's hard to look at it is necessary. Watching the film should remind the viewer that we as a species have a great potential for harm and that this potential is so easily realised. The movie shows us that doing evil is easy. It's the easiest thing in the world. The hard thing is being good. And most of the time we fail at it. Most of the time evil is where we end up.".

I have the opinion that it is a story of fear provoked by popular beliefs in Peru because some women in the Shining Path Era a Guerrilla group of the eighties that it emerged in Peru they were raped and mistreated and had children marked by this fear. Fausta is a young woman marked and judged by society since she is the daughter of a rape and her mother was responsible for transmitting this fear with popular beliefs such as the frightened tit milk of sorrow which is transmitted by mothers to their mothers. babies. You can also clearly see the social racism in this movie. After the death of Fausta's mother she needs to get money to be able to bury her mother in her homeland that's when she gets a job in a house of high social class where the owner takes advantage of her shyness and lack of education by stealing a song that uses it as theirs. Fausta confronts her fears in that house and confronts them when she meets the gardener of the house speaks with her own language that is Quechua she feels very good with him. Fausta's strength is imposed on the pain and fear in which he lived in that society he manages to remove the potato he had in his body which caused him discomfort. She manages to bury her mother but first she goes through the sea that signals the new life that awaits her later a hope of a new life for Fausta without fears without pain. The film also shows violence against women that leaves them soulless and very afraid.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film begins with a horrifying story of rape and violence told through the song of an elderly woman who lays dying on her bed. She describes her horrific experiences during the years of the conflict in Peru between Sendero Luminoso a left wing guerrilla group and the Peruvian government. Though she has lost much in the conflict including her husband whose emasculation and murder she describes in her song she has left behind a daughter Fausta who becomes our protagonist. Fausta and her family do not have money to bury her mother or return her body to their village so Fausta accepts work in the home of a wealthy white pianist. Fausta and her family are indigenous and live in poverty in Lima Peru where wealth class and race are all still intertwined. Fausta shares her mothers penchant for composing songs and her boss who is struggling to complete a piece by her recital date encourages Fausta to sing for her. When Fausta finishes her song the boss performs it to a standing ovation in a packed theater. When tries to have her work acknowledged she is left abandoned on the dark streets of Lima a terrifying fate for Fausta who has a crippling fear of men and is afraid of being assaulted like her mother was.What Claudia Llosa has done perfectly here is capture the undertones of race sex and class that define so much of most modern societies. Fausta fears rape and this fear is especially valid given that she is an indigenous woman. If Fausta were not both indigenous and a woman the threat of rape or any other form of violation would not be so understandable. Native people in Peru are often limited by a governmentalsocietal system that not only devalues them but actively targeted them in the recent past. Though Fausta's fears stem from the past treatment of indigenous woman in Peru her boss's duplicity is a product of a modern social structure that has not changed too drastically from previous decades. This is the context that makes her boss's strong reaction to her quiet comments so powerful. How dare Fausta a poor indigenous woman try to take any credit for her own work? Fausta attacked Peru's system of societal system by simply acknowledging it when quiet acceptance of the creative theft was the expectation. In La Teta Asustada Llosa displays the two extremes of oppression. The first being violence and the latter silence.".

	schema:reviewBody "La teta asustada 2009 directed by Claudia Llosa tells the story of Faustaan indigenous young woman who is subject to the poverty presently dominating much of rural Peru in the aftermath of heinous crimes that surged throughout most of the country during the second half of the twentieth century. Set in the outskirts of Lima Fausta's story is one in which the protagonist undergoes immense character development as she faces various obstacles after her mother's death at the beginning of the film. These trials challenge her several fears including her extreme aversion towards men and her seemingly excessive fear of being raped.The film's title stems from the commonly held belief that Fausta suffers from a disease transmitted to her from her mother during breastfeeding. Prior to her death Fausta's mother sings about the horrible violence she endured earlier in life. She and her family believe her mother's fears were thus transmitted to Fausta. This illness manifests itself through various symptoms such as Fausta's reluctance to go out and do anything without the company of an individual she trusts as well as through her shocking decision to place a potato inside her vagina in hopes of preventing rape.Overall the plot revolves around Fausta overcoming these fears in addition to her marginalized role as a poor indigenous woman in order to obtain enough money to afford a proper burial for her mother's corpse. The main criticism I offer regarding this film is that it falls short of providing both insight into and a brief history of the horrific violence that surged through Peru in the late 1900s. In providing the audience with a worldview likely unfamiliar to them Llosa assumes that the viewer is familiar with this violence which may lead to confusion at various points. Without background information it is easy for the viewer to assume Fausta's fears are completely and utterly irrational which I believe can be detrimental to the viewing experience.".

In providing the audience with a worldview likely unfamiliar to them Llosa assumes that the viewer is familiar with this violence which may lead to confusion at various points. Without background information it is easy for the viewer to assume Fausta's fears are completely and utterly irrational which I believe can be detrimental to the viewing experience.";

The split screen is easy to adjust to and really wraps you in you're quite fascinated to see what these two people will do next. I loved the set up it lent itself to a nice surprise for the audience and felt completely natural.What really shines in this movie is the dialog...it's some of the most brilliant original dialog between two people with a shared past that I've ever heard. During the QA afterward I was actually a bit disappointed the director didn't give the screenwriter more credit for her amazing script which she wrote in three weeks. It's so engaging and natural you might guess it was improvised...but 99 came directly off the page. Helena Bonham Carter and Aaron Eckel really landed plum roles for themselves in this story and I've never loved them more than here. The reviewer who thought Helena was miscast is way off in his perception. It's not about wedding sexual tension good grief and it's far from a chick flick...it's about the deep connection between two people regardless of time and similar to Before Sunrise etc. yet quite different but I don't want to spoil it. The film is touching very humorous and deeply thoughtful. You will want to watch it several times to catch all that happens.".

	schema:headline " An Emotional OneNight Stand Made Uniquely Resonant by a Split Screen and Carter's Superb Work";
	schema:reviewBody "There are so many conventional movies about adulterous chance meetings that the prospects of another one wouldn't seem to be too promising. However director Hans Canosa takes a rather novel approach with this smallscale 2006 indie film in looking at the illicit onenight stand with a pervasive splitscreen process. Most often the two sides reflect the perspectives from the man and woman at the center of the story and at other times we see their individual memories as flashbacks to their youthful courtship. Initially the gimmicky aspect of watching the duality of the action is rather jarring but it gradually becomes a dramatically effective means for exhibiting the dynamics of the two characters in real time. Gabrielle Zevin's sharply delineated often amusing dialogue also helps to bring an immediacy to what could have been a predictably drawn situation.The intimate verbose plot itself turns on several contrivances some more forgivable than others like the absence of names for the lovers and the misunderstanding arising from matching cell phones. Regardless it's really the adroit charm and emotional dexterity of the actors that sets this movie apart. Playing yet another rascally manchild Aaron Eckhart adds shades of midlife romantic vulnerability that make his character likeably flawed. But the picture really belongs to Helena Bonham Carter's richly textured performance as the woman easily her best work since 1997's The Wings of the Dove. As a complacent married woman who feels herself hurtling palpably toward forty she provides such revealing nuance with each scene that I ended up wondering more about her character's fate than his. With her sad dark eyes and pouty mouth she looks more like legendary French actress Jeanne Moreau as the years pass.Shot in only thirteen days and with a running time of only 84 minutes the movie is quite small in scope but it is also a relatively undiscovered gem that will hopefully take on new life on DVD. Speaking of which the 2007 DVD has a surprisingly robust number of extras beginning with Canosa's thoughtful commentary track. Also included are an entertaining 25minute interview with an easily bantering Eckhart and Carter from the Telluride Film Festival an insightful fiveminute short with the director showing a demo of his dualcamera filmmaking technique a helpful fourminute explanation of why splitscreen was used specifically for the film and a less interesting more technical twentyminute demonstration of how Canosa used Apple Final Cut Pro software to make his complex edits.".

But after seeing the film I agree with Ebertthe split screen comes to seem necessary. The split screen is used not only to show the simultaneous actions and reactions of both characters but also shows flashbacks juxtaposed with the present alternate versions of the present and moments imagined or hoped by the characters that quickly return to reality. Sometimes the present is fractured into more than one emotion for a given line or action showing an actor performing the same moment in different ways. The editing is assured and masterful employing storytelling techniques that couldn't exist without the split screen. The writing is brilliant full of humor and insight. The movie is like nothing you've ever seen before.Aaron Eckhart and Helena Bonham Carter are amazingfunny and heartbreaking at the same time. I really can't wait to see this movie again.

Usually we are shown the same event from different angles other times the 2 sides are splits in time so we see the past and present. The main characters played brilliantly by Helena Bonham Carter and Aaron Eckhart meet as participants in a wedding and rediscover their past. The dialog is brilliantly written and the acting superb. In the question and answer session after the screening Ms. Carter was asked if the split screen made acting more difficult. She replied that unlike the shooting of a normal movie where they would have to shoot each person's part separately then take a break and move the camera and do the other person with both camera's running at the same time the whole scene could be shot nearly continuously allowing for a more realistic conversation situation. This made things much easier but she did admit she missed having any down time since she was always in front of one of the cameras.".

It follows two deliberately unnamed characters a man and a woman through the latter part of a wedding reception and holds on them through their evening together. Earlier works like Richard Linklater's duo Before Sunrise and Before Sunset come instantly to mind. Although it might not literally be conveyed in real time there's such immediacy to the conversation that ensues. Like Linklater's films the dialogue heavy film never feels overbearing and stagelike possibly due to the writing and possibly due to the visual technique that will no doubt color many reviews and comments about the film. It's told with a constant use of splitscreen in an attempt to present two perspectives. Mostly the use of this style assists with pacing and never fully follows through on the promise of conveying opposing story lines. Regardless the choice to use splitscreen never becomes flashy like it did in when it came into vogue in the mid1960s but it does seem more fueled by digital ability than narrative necessity. Whether it's this curious technique the impressive performances of Aaron Eckhart and Helena Bonham Carter or the subtle screen writing Conversations with Other Women seems to effortlessly become one of those quickly cherished works that demands you hang onto every word every gesture. It's really a beautiful work and has the potential to become a classic love story couples and hopeless romantics will go to for years to come. But it very likely won't.".

	schema:headline " Better than Before Sunset";
	schema:reviewBody "This exceptionally wellwritten and stylishly directed film reminded me a lot of the Linklater films in that it was essentially an extended intense and modestly crosscultural conversation between a woman and a man. In this case the darker character was the woman played by Bonham Carter and the charming and ebullient character was the man played by Aaron Eckhart. The dialogue was as engaging and intelligent as Before Sunset's but unlike that film this story didn't bail out before its ending. Bonham Carter's performance was excellent and I think I'm being objective in saying that Eckhart managed to keep up with his costar bringing much more than pure charm to his role. The splitscreen will be thrilling to some viewers and offputting to others. I'd usually put myself in the latter camp but the movie's myriad other virtues held me in such thrall that I couldn't manage to get too annoyed with the splitscreen. Definitely worth a second viewing.".

The combination of Helena Bonham Carter and the terrific Aaron Eckhart together on the screen with dialog that is out of this world both funny and sad at the same time makes this film an intelligent and smart artistic piece of work. And the split screen makes it even more interesting as you get to watch the actors pull off such marvelous performances. I want to see this film again just to see what I might have missed.When the film begins at a wedding and continues with the momentum of the attraction a couple feel for one another it is impossible not to think of your own wedding experiences and perhaps the magic of meeting the right one as time ticks away in your life. New York is the perfect location for this film and as the last frame of the film appears before the credits roll you simply don't want to have this couple leave. CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER WOMEN makes you really think about what is important in your personal life and when you finally meet that special person hold on to him or her for the rest of your life. Bravo Hans Canosa for this brilliant film.".

Independently it is emotionally affecting and works on that score as well.Be aware that there is a spoiler coming.The thing that works is the writing. It is amazing. Often a writer faces the challenge of being invisible. There are advantages to this because the more you add the eye of someone not actually in the story the less power the dynamics of the story have. This impossible invisibility carries over to the problem of explanatory speaking. When you have a character saying something purely because you as a viewer need to know it you blow a hole in your boat.The writing here takes that problem and turns it against itself. Usually I would remark that it is a narrative fold placed deep in the narrative. But my regular crew knows that  it is why this was recommended.There are only two actors. They are unnamed and credited as man and woman. In a profound display of ignorance the included DVD interviews with these two actors includes a question about why their characters were unnamed. Both said it was because the story was universal and so on. But the viewer will see that these two people are actually many souls and many fabricated or desired versions of some of those souls. Each of these souls exists because they are part of a story being told to themselves or the other actor.The writing has us completely out of the noir loop at least the ordinary one. We are given no background and have to figure things out over time. As the movie develops we are teased into a single narrative. By the end we believe we know what we are supposed to a man meets his exwife at the wedding of his sister. They are still attracted to each other and cannot purge that even though they have moved to others. They work at living with this she as confirming her separation by testing it he by reinforcing his knots of selfdoubt. But they do so by reference to other selves both past selves from the courtship and marriage and parallel selves they maintain. Check out the rather brilliant title.There was a child involved.Against this spine discovering what the story is the writer has created playful dialog that skips around maintaining multiple perspectives truths. selves. It is wonderful and the look of the two actors especially knowing Helena's background in such films is wonderful.Another attraction is that the film is mostly a splitscreen experiment. The filmmaker obviously selected the technique  one would think by watching it  to register that at any given moment the speaker is at least two individuals. Sometimes in fact this is how the screen is used. At other times it simply follows the two actors in real time. Other effects are added to the vocabulary.So the idea of the experiment and that it was shot quickly and edited on a MacBook has appeal. But the splitscreen needed some more care than it got here and watching this more than once it becomes clear that the reach of the filmmaker was less than his intuition. I applaud the attempt but the cinema is something of a mess.The actors are earnest and Carter has that confused look as if there are many souls within confusing her. But they don't master the words at all. They simply deliver them in the by now standard established by Mamet. The rhythm is good but the actual meaning is lost because they don't know what they are saying. The actors are as confused as the characters.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

At times one half of the screen shows a younger pair a boy and a girl barely out of their teens reliving portions of the conversation that the man and the woman weave. We wonder if perhaps the younger boy and girl could be as a matter of fact the man and the woman fifteen years ago they do imply that they did in fact meet when they were younger but this all could be part of this elaborate verbal tease meeting for the first time in a park as she read Emma and initiating a tempestuous love affair that ended all too soon. All this becomes curiouser and curiouser as the night rolls on and it seems clear that something is going to play out between them which may bring back elements from their past and spell out what might happen come morning.This is Hans Canosa's CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER WOMEN which is a twoperson romantic comedy of manners that is clever and artdirected from start to finish. Helena BonhamCarter an actress we've seen in more costume dramas than comedies is a fantastic choice to play the older woman. BonhamCarter glides by playfully and in one revealing scene she exposes herself to be less than perfect and with a little bit of a tummy as her character scathingly tells the man played by Aaron Eckhart he's gained weight when he clearly is fit which makes her more accessible than the average beautyobsessed fortyyear old woman. She discloses little about herself  at least in bits and pieces at a time and even then she's always withholding as if in fear of losing some vital part of herself which makes her part in the movie rather difficult but engaging and enigmatic. Eckhart on the other hand has a much easier role being the forthright male with wit charm and a pinch of insecurity who reveals an essential goodness about him that is willing to give even when he fears the ultimate rejection.I loved the duality of CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER WOMEN. Knowing practically nothing about the two people's reason of being at this wedding party it played as a setup piece that had somewhere to go. Wasting no time its use of a split screen is an asset even when some people may dismiss it as a hattrick andor a distraction because the man and the woman are already separated in more ways than one. The great irony of this 'trick' is the final shot which is telling in so many ways and punctuates if these two ever had a future together from the getgo or were they doomed to repeat the same songanddance of coy flirtation nearly twenty years later. And there's the question of the title of this movie why other women when all you see for the most is BonhamCarter? It recalled a painting I'm familiar with Marcel Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase where you see fragmented images of an abstracted figure as if seen in multiple microshots superimposed over another. It made me wonder if this would be a nod to the many facets that glide over BonhamCarter's glacial facade since she seems to be living several realities in one vague picture and the way she recalls the past is different from the way Eckhart sees it. Clever smart a bittersweet portrait of two emotionally stunted people.".

In fact the entire movie is on split screen. Sometimes even when the characters appear in the same scene in a simple conversation they are shown separately on the left and right screens so that there is no conclusive evidence that they are REALLY talking to each other. But the infinite variation of ways in which the split screen is used is mindboggling. If I try to describe all these different ways the movie is presented on the split screen I would exceed the IMDb 1000 word limit many times. But the important thing is that this is not hollow flashy show off. While you applaud the imaginative and creative style we also notice that these things are done at specific situations for specific effects and purposes and do add a great deal to the movie.But regardless of how innovative and clever are the techniques it is ultimately the human story that captivates the audience. Here we have a young couple meeting falling in love coming together and then parted. But all these are in flashbacks and we don't even know their names. We see their reencountering years later during a wedding party when she has been married to a cardiologist and he living with a girlfriend who is a dancer.Here again comparison to Before Sunset is inevitable. The biggest difference is of course that Jesse and Celine never had the good fortune of being together at all. The similarity though is in the continuous conversation after the reencounter. The man and the woman in Conversation however ironically engage in considerably more than just conversation. As to the conversation itself it is not as elegant and compelling as Before Sunset. And yet it moves in its own bittersweet earnestness.Much of the charm of Conversation is absolutely to the credit of the leads. Aaron Eckhart who was quite impressive in Possession plays the hardtoread man who eventually does have some affecting moments towards the end. Helena Bonham Carter probably the only actress alive who can match Cate Blanchett in versatility do you recall Cate ever portraying an ape? delivers in a pitchperfect performance the intelligent but slightly neurotic vulnerable woman. The young actors who play the role of the couple in their youth Erik Eiden and Nora Zehetner are healthily freshlooking and immensely likable.This is a sadder movie but not without its funny moments compared with Before Sunset but those who have enjoyed Before Sunset should have no problem liking Conversation.".

Conversations with Other Women is a riveting bittersweet honest and realistic movie about making choices losses and regrets. Two people used to be the one world which had split years ago leaving them not just on the different continents but on the different halves of the screen. The film brings to mind Before Sunrise of course but its atmosphere is more sober and melancholic. It is not about possibility of future together it is all about past. Both actors are excellent.

	schema:reviewBody "In the modern age of cinema where everything seems like it's been done a thousand times before there are a bounty of films which try to be unique in order to garner more attention. One way of accomplishing this freshness is by using a diverse style to display their work. Sometimes these techniques can succeed admirably examples include PunchDrunk Love and The Fountain but more often than not the case is that the film's style becomes too overwhelming and the story becomes completely insignificant examples can range from Sunshine to Kill Bill to Adapation. and beyond. I am more than pleased to say that Conversations with Other Women succeeds admirably in creating a very unique style but making this fresh technique play second fiddle to the wonderful story and characters it creates.The film centers around the story of Man Aaron Eckhart and Woman Helena Bonham Carter who reunite at the wedding of Man's sister numerous years after their painful upanddown relationship which ended in divorce very reminiscent of Before Sunset but also immensely different. The idea of making the characters completely anonymous is another unique trait that I adore. It adds a certain sense of universal emotion to these people and certainly helps the audience to relate to them. It's because of the story itself that this film is familiar and emotional. The plot is just so universal anyone who's ever had a relationship can relate to the awkwardness and emotional dilemma that comes from reuniting with an ex after a certain length of time has passed since the breakup. There's an aura of familiarity and sexual tension but you know this person is completely different than the one you were originally attracted to.They reunite at this wedding and the flirtation occurs immediately. Right when he offers her a glass of champagne it's clear in Woman's sights what they are going to end up doing. They flirt comfortably while mocking the other attendees who they have no concern for and awkwardly catch up on the current lives of one another. Both of them are in relationships Man with a dancer for the sake of it Woman happily married to a cardiologist. Still Woman knows exactly what the night will result in. They leave and go back to her room all the while awkwardly talking about life and love. They undress discuss the difference between being fat and putting on 10ish pounds and make love this lovemaking sequence is one of an almost poetic beauty far different from the gratuitous rough displays of meaningless sex in the majority of films produced these days. All the while there are brief clips of their formal selves. We see the budding relationship of two young kids in love blended in with the mutual attraction of two lonely adults simply escaping from their lives.This blend comes from the unique style that director Hans Canosa creates. He presents the entire story in splitscreen a technique that takes a few minutes to get used to but then you fall in love with it for the most part with one camera on Woman and one camera on Man. Occasionally we see their past relationship split with their night of rekindling and we see the contrast between these two very different relationships. Through all of this brilliance in story and style what Conversations with Other Women all comes down to are the characters and the actors portraying them. This is a film about these two beautifully flawed realistic characters and the performances from Eckhart and Bonham Carter reflect this beauty flawlessly. Helena is unbelievably endearing adorable and inexplicably humorous in what is surely one of my favorites performances in the history of film. Eckhart is flamboyant charming and provides the perfect chemistry to create a perfect onscreen couple. However it's the deep inner pain that both actors create that makes this film one of the most relateable and utterly heartbreaking in years. A perfect example of flawless substance over magnetically unique style.".

They flirt comfortably while mocking the other attendees who they have no concern for and awkwardly catch up on the current lives of one another. Both of them are in relationships Man with a dancer for the sake of it Woman happily married to a cardiologist. Still Woman knows exactly what the night will result in. They leave and go back to her room all the while awkwardly talking about life and love. They undress discuss the difference between being fat and putting on 10ish pounds and make love this lovemaking sequence is one of an almost poetic beauty far different from the gratuitous rough displays of meaningless sex in the majority of films produced these days. All the while there are brief clips of their formal selves. We see the budding relationship of two young kids in love blended in with the mutual attraction of two lonely adults simply escaping from their lives.This blend comes from the unique style that director Hans Canosa creates. He presents the entire story in splitscreen a technique that takes a few minutes to get used to but then you fall in love with it for the most part with one camera on Woman and one camera on Man. Occasionally we see their past relationship split with their night of rekindling and we see the contrast between these two very different relationships. Through all of this brilliance in story and style what Conversations with Other Women all comes down to are the characters and the actors portraying them. This is a film about these two beautifully flawed realistic characters and the performances from Eckhart and Bonham Carter reflect this beauty flawlessly. Helena is unbelievably endearing adorable and inexplicably humorous in what is surely one of my favorites performances in the history of film. Eckhart is flamboyant charming and provides the perfect chemistry to create a perfect onscreen couple. However it's the deep inner pain that both actors create that makes this film one of the most relateable and utterly heartbreaking in years. A perfect example of flawless substance over magnetically unique style.";

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Conversations with Other Women";
	schema:reviewBody "Conversations with Other Women is a talkie movie along the same vein as Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise and Before Sunset as it takes place in one single night of a wedding of a Man's Aaron Eckhart sister. He chances upon Woman Helena Bonham Carter one of his sister's bridesmaid and proceeds to flirt with her in the hopes of getting lucky for a one night stand.And yes they do talk a lot but instead of the free ranging topics as in the Linklater movies their conversation is focused mainly on relationships and the games people play in trying to be coy and hard to get. No doubt the many lines in the movie might be familiar but they're full of wit and delivered through excellent performances by the two leads this is definitely the surprise movie of the lot I've sat through this week. If Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy gave us the teenage and early thirties version about two strangers connecting with each other then Aaron Eckhart and Helena Bonham Carter provides us the late thirties version in this movie and more.The obvious thing that hits you when the movie starts is the split screen. It is used throughout the movie so it's as if you're watching two movies at the same time but not quite. Technically Conversations is very strong as it takes balls for filmmaker Hans Canosa to pull this off not to mention the editing which would drive anyone nuts for the record he did the editing himself after his editor gave up and he used only Final Cut Pro to do what you see on screen  the product gets a credit too with the Apple logo!. The split allowed for parallel narratives to play out simultaneously for flashbacks and for emphasis and more importantly brought out the best in the leads.Why? Simply because they have to act the whole time through no shots over the shoulder where you can idle when the camera's not on you or editing used to cover bad takes or flubbed dialogues or something that perturbs me  lines said by the person who's back is to the camera when obviously the movement of their chin gives everything away. Gone too are boring talking heads as here you get to see the lines delivered and the reaction from the other party at the same time without the camera flinching. In order words the leads gotta be consistent throughout given the camera is on their every expression. Indeed a challenge which Eckhart and Bonham Carter There's a separate reason why I would want to watch this movie in the first place and that's to observe Aaron Eckhart's performance as he's pulled off many superb character actors in movies like Thank You for Smoking and Black Dahlia and I'm confident that he'll be able to pull off Harvey Dent in The Dark Knight with aplomb. As Man who's succumbing to the weakness of the flesh his desperation comes with a reason only to be revealed in due course. Helena Bonham Carter was last heard in Wallace and Gromit and Corpse Bride and it's indeed high time we see her back on the big screens again. Come to think of it the last time I saw her in a movie with a substantial role was way back in Fight Club. Here her Woman is intriguing as to her intent and purpose and no doubt you will inevitably cast that questioning eye on her.A word of caution if you want to be surprised in the movie don't go to IMDb and look at their plot keywords as it'll give everything away. What makes this movie work is to go in fresh listen intently get blown away by the excellent technicals employed and in fact it makes you think all the way through the end as little details get dropped along and provides you ample time to piece everything together.It's not a boring movie contrary to those who think that talkie movies are. This movie has an excellent witty script and delivers emotional punches where it should. And the ending is something that will be in your head for a long period of time after the lights come on. Recommended stuff!".

Though not a great actress her acting ability actually beats just about anyone else in this. The only other familiar face for me was Marc Lawrence who plays the nightclub owner and the villain of the piece. Her lovesick brother Edgar Edwards sees a blatant gold digger Phyllis Clare who shows she doesn't need him. She proudly shows a 100000 bracelet. Her maid comes to find the brother standing over the gold digger's body. The hero detective is played by Charles Quigley. a total nonactor. The rest of the plot is quite nonsensical. Hayworth gets saved by William Irving who played an obnoxious drunk who later transforms into a obnoxious policeman. However if you are a Rita Hayworth fan it's fun seeing her as bright eyed and bushy tailed as the ingnue. We are treated with her giving another amazing dance just prior to fade out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rita Hayworth's true star power didn't explode on screen until 1941 when she danced with Fred Astaire for the first time but for several years she had been on the rise at Columbia after several years in the background. Her early Columbia films have been very difficult to find for the most part so when they do turn up they are delightful surprises for sure even if the movies themselves are just average. In this film young Rita is a cabaret dancer already tired out and looking to find a better way of making a living without disillusionment. She is also a very protective older sister looking out for reckless brother Edgar Edwards even when he defies her good advice. Against her wishes he plans on running away with nasty dancer Phyllis Clare whom Rita has a confrontation with that ends up with a slap to Clare's face by the sweet looking Rita. There's no holding Edwards back from heading to Clare's apartment and when he gets there Clare's maid Noel Cusack finds Edwards over Clare's dead body. The distraught Rita quickly claims she killed Clare in a last minute confrontation but her weak attempts to protect her brother are seen through easily by her cop boyfriend Charles Quigley. Edwards is sentenced to be hung and Hayworth and Quigley decide to work together to find a way of clearing him.Even though they work in the same profession there is no comparing Hayworth's basically decent dancer to Clare's opportunistic viper. It is obvious from the confrontation between the two women that Clare will end up on a slab and it happens extremely quickly. This quota quickie is fun but typical B material filmed in Vancouver although by the looks of the film it could have just as easily been made in Hollywood. The highlight of this film is the auction sequence of Clare's belongings I just love her character's name of Ruby Rose not to be confused with the Dominican playboy Rubirosa where members of organized crime lead by Marc Lawrence try to get their hands on a music box that Hayworth also bids on. It is obvious that Hayworth is determined to give a believable performance and you never take her eyes off of her. The same year she played a murder victim in Who Killed Gail Preston? as a nasty nightclub singer so it's nice to see her survive here. Doreen MacGregor adds innocence and pathos to the role of the girlfriend Edwards dropped so he could find sin with the opportunistic Clare. You pretty much know what happened from the moment certain characters appear on screen so there isn't much as far as suspense but as a record of Hayworth's rise to screen immortality the film is quite memorable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ed Wood was one of the greatest moviemakers in film history. Could he direct? Not really. Were his movies technical masterpieces? Could his actors act? Did he have huge budgets? No. We're here fifty years later talking about him because he created worlds on film nobody had ever seen before or since. His characters talked like nobody we've ever heard before though there are strong echoes in the works of Hartley and Lynch. And unlike every Hollywood movie ever made Ed ripped open his heart and poured it out on the screen. Never more so than in Glen Or Glenda his original avantgarde masterpiece.Avantgarde? You heard me. What is the definition of avantgarde film? Some attributes are unconventional narrative unique visual style radical rejection of artistic or social norms an often willful disregard for reality. Gloria Floren said Avantgarde films are often iconoclastic mocking conventional morality and traditional values the filmmaker's intense interest in eccentricities and extremes may shock viewers. Indeed the avantgarde film maker's purpose may be to wake or shake up the audience from the stupor of ordinary consciousness or the doldrums of conventional perspective.Imagine if people viewed Un Chien Andalou or Meshes Of The Afternoon or Eraserhead with fratboy derision instead of holy reverence. They'd be viewed as unwatchable nonsense too. Everybody'd have a good snark watching for continuity errors and bad camera moves. Does Glen or Glenda rise to the level of those classics? Time will tell but try this experiment watch it as if it were and see. The results may surprise you.Here are some hints. Lugosi is not a mad scientisthe's God looking down upon twisted human morality and pulling the strings. The green eyed monster that eats little boys? Envy. Envy of women and in this case their clothes. That envy has eaten vast amounts of Glen's life it's been a torture to him. There are numerous references to that torture and misery. There's also an entire section devoted to judgmenthuman judgment versus that reserved to God. The nonsensical stock footage of buffaloes and the army? It signifies the rush of adrenaline fear and anxiety as Glen tries to confront his identity and come out to his girlfriend. Far from random it's actually used with ingenuity and skill. The symbology of scenes in which Glen battles his female self and resists the devil should be obvious. But then again a generous viewing of Glen or Glenda rather than a beerfueled let's watch a crap movie viewing would reveal a great deal. Even the campy scene at the end when Dolores Fuller relents and gives Glen her sweater comes with the alwaysmissed segment where God absolves Glen of his misery. There are a dozen moments like this. Sure there are a dozen technical flubs and random nonsense too but all good art is organic. There's a guy wearing a Timex in BenHur for god's sake.The narrator seems comical and dated to us but in 1953 he was standardissue and the lines we now take as campy were then revolutionary almost treasonous. A plea for tolerance for sexual and gender differences? Condemning the police for arresting gays and transvestites just for existing? During the McCarthy era when all homosexuals were presumed to be communists? A film like that is bound to make some enemies. Especially a film that featured not actors playing deviants but the deviants themselves in their own words. It's telling that the extremereligiousconservative Medved brothers were the ones who named Ed Wood worst director of all time. They must have thought they were really sticking it to Ed Wood for making all those subversively weird films involving crossdressing and homosexuals and society's outcasts. Thankfully irony remains the most powerful force in the universe and their meanspirited declaration made Ed Wood a household name. Whether they admit it or not a lot of this movie's detractors are laughing at the subject not the movie. Many others are baffled by the unconventional narrative. Just because you don't get something doesn't mean there is nothing to get.It's easy to give any movie the MST3K treatment especially ones that veer into uncomfortable or seemingly absurd territory. If you're looking for the worst movie ever made go watch Armageddon or Crossroads. If you're looking for THE pioneering moment in GLBT film history the greatest and most underrated American DIY avantegarde feature of its time or an experience that just might change the way you view movies and the world at large start right here.".

While I was first watching Tim Burton's fantastic film recreating the making of Glen Or Glenda I noticed that there were things in it that seemed rather familiar to me even after 30 years have passed and that is what partly interested me in looking into both the book and Ed Wood's films. What I discovered was I had seen this film when I was in GRADE SCHOOL!!After viewing the REAL Glen OR Glenda film I realized that I had had seen this exact same film before although heavily edited!It was shown as a part of our sexed class!! I can hardly believe it that they showed us this back then but they did. Nothanks to the school I went to and the horribly incompetent teachers but they did show it!Now fast forward to today the reason for all of the extra scenes near the end of the film such as the 'Devil' sequences and the rest of the rather abstract looking scenes were not originally part of the screenplay. Those scenes baffling and dumbfounding were NOT part of the film as Ed had written. His script left the running time short of what George Weiss had told him he wanted a 7 reel 16MM film which was what he needed to sell it. A 16MM reel runs about 10 minutes and George needed a 70 minute film at least because he presold it in several states as a Feature before he actually found out what it really was. He wasn't too pleased with what Ed had made but he was able to distribute it to his clients after all of the extraneous material was added at the end. George did eventually make his money back and he and Ed worked on a couple of other projects unlike what is shown in the Ed Wood film.Even today though I think that this film was made way before it's time and Ed Wood should deserve some credit for trying to bring a sense of understanding to what was then a totally misunderstood way of life for a select few.".

	schema:headline " A Classic? Without a Doubt. Don't Believe Me? Look Deeper.";
	schema:reviewBody "The 1950s a rigid and conforming time period in American history a time when homophobia ran rampant and diverse lifestyles simply were not tolerated or glorified came the 1953 transvestite drama 'Glen or Glenda'. 'Glen or Glenda' was Edward D. Wood's featurelength directorial debut and is considered by many to be one of the most obscure films of all time. Ed Wood's first big picture was quite a special one for him the main reason being that it told a story very dear to him. Ed Wood was in many senses the character of GlenGlenda. The fact is Ed Wood did find comfort in women's clothing and he did favor angora sweaters to the traditional shirt and tie which defined the era. These factors contribute to the film making the effort and ultimately the passion behind the film. Ed Wood was making a picture with a subject matter very dear to him and it comes through in this fine piece of work. Glen or Glenda is now considered to be a cult classic but at the time it explored previously uncharted territory not that this was a smashhit when it came out in 1953 either. However this is certainly not to say that the film is irrelevant to today's social standards regulations and expectations on the contrary it proves to be quite pertinent to life in the 21st century.'Glen or Glenda' opens with a character simply cast as 'Scientist' Bela Lugosi prophetically speaking of the society in which we live and its and loathing of the seemingly abnormal or unknown. He speaks of society's outcasts the troubled world in which they live and the problems they face in their day to day lives. The story ensues as the police arrive at the scene of a recent suicide. The victim was a wellknown transvestite cast out by society and all others around him. Among the police is Inspector Warren Lyle Talbot. Troubled by this seemingly strange case he seeks help in Dr. Alton Timothy Farrell a respected psychoanalysis who has encountered various transvestites in his line of work. He begins to tell Inspector Warren of a patient he once dealt with named Glen. Glen was engaged to be married to Barbara Dolores Fuller but had been hiding a dark secret from his fiance Glen or Glenda? was secretly a transvestite. Alton continues to tell Inspector Warren of the internal struggle within Glen whether to tell Barbara of his secret lifestyle or to keep it to himself or to entirely stop wearing the clothes which make him feel so much like himself?Although the subject matter upon first glance may seem to some a tongue in cheek jab at the transvestites and other oddballs of the world it was not intended that way  nor does it come across as such after viewing the film. 'Glen or Glenda' is a startlingly solid effort at a fresh and controversial subject of the 1950s. Not only was the film fresh and innovative but it prospered on a technical level as well. With excellent cinematography and pristine appropriate lighting the film is technically quite good. Dolores Fuller's acting is wellbelow average but the other characters offer decent performances Ed Wood's acting is curiously above average seeing how he had little to no professional acting experience. Bela Lugosi's performance is as always a strong one with memorable dialogue. Although Lugosi is technically listed as a 'Scientist' in the film symbolically he represents God. He is the one who pulls the strings he is the one who has become filled with contempt for the human race and its judgmental nature. The symbolism within 'Glen or Glenda' is often overlooked and classified as inept dialogue but to an acute observer it is astoundingly developed. The greeneyed monster mentioned by Bela Lugosi's character can be interpreted as Glen's envy of women and their clothing. The seemingly random stock footage of the Buffalo represents the rush that Glen feels when symbolically transformed into Glenda. When realized 'Glen or Glenda' is full of metaphoric meaning and symbolism as well as a fresh plot rife with unique social commentary. 'Glen or Glenda' is a film which does not dance around the subject matter. It recognizes an important at least to director Ed Wood and controversial social issue and discusses it in full leaving nothing left unspoken. The film proves itself to be enjoyable and entertaining to watch throughout with some memorable performances for better or for worse... and an interesting plot. With such originality and such passion Glen or Glenda is a film which should be respected and treasured rather than criticized for its belowaverage acting seemingly strange dialogue and obscure premise for its pure outspoken zealousness in the 1950s a period when transvestism and homosexuality were blatantly not openly accepted. Is this to say that these lifestyles are accepted today? Shall we consult Pat Robertson or perhaps George W. Bush on this matter? The film is just as relevant today as it was in 1953 when it was first released. Glen or Glenda proves to be entertaining and intriguing full of obscure characters and a fresh subject matter a film far ahead of it's time.".

Ed Wood's first big picture was quite a special one for him the main reason being that it told a story very dear to him. Ed Wood was in many senses the character of GlenGlenda. The fact is Ed Wood did find comfort in women's clothing and he did favor angora sweaters to the traditional shirt and tie which defined the era. These factors contribute to the film making the effort and ultimately the passion behind the film. Ed Wood was making a picture with a subject matter very dear to him and it comes through in this fine piece of work. Glen or Glenda is now considered to be a cult classic but at the time it explored previously uncharted territory not that this was a smashhit when it came out in 1953 either. However this is certainly not to say that the film is irrelevant to today's social standards regulations and expectations on the contrary it proves to be quite pertinent to life in the 21st century.'Glen or Glenda' opens with a character simply cast as 'Scientist' Bela Lugosi prophetically speaking of the society in which we live and its and loathing of the seemingly abnormal or unknown. He speaks of society's outcasts the troubled world in which they live and the problems they face in their day to day lives. The story ensues as the police arrive at the scene of a recent suicide. The victim was a wellknown transvestite cast out by society and all others around him. Among the police is Inspector Warren Lyle Talbot. Troubled by this seemingly strange case he seeks help in Dr. Alton Timothy Farrell a respected psychoanalysis who has encountered various transvestites in his line of work. He begins to tell Inspector Warren of a patient he once dealt with named Glen. Glen was engaged to be married to Barbara Dolores Fuller but had been hiding a dark secret from his fiance Glen or Glenda? was secretly a transvestite. Alton continues to tell Inspector Warren of the internal struggle within Glen whether to tell Barbara of his secret lifestyle or to keep it to himself or to entirely stop wearing the clothes which make him feel so much like himself?Although the subject matter upon first glance may seem to some a tongue in cheek jab at the transvestites and other oddballs of the world it was not intended that way  nor does it come across as such after viewing the film. 'Glen or Glenda' is a startlingly solid effort at a fresh and controversial subject of the 1950s. Not only was the film fresh and innovative but it prospered on a technical level as well. With excellent cinematography and pristine appropriate lighting the film is technically quite good. Dolores Fuller's acting is wellbelow average but the other characters offer decent performances Ed Wood's acting is curiously above average seeing how he had little to no professional acting experience. Bela Lugosi's performance is as always a strong one with memorable dialogue. Although Lugosi is technically listed as a 'Scientist' in the film symbolically he represents God. He is the one who pulls the strings he is the one who has become filled with contempt for the human race and its judgmental nature. The symbolism within 'Glen or Glenda' is often overlooked and classified as inept dialogue but to an acute observer it is astoundingly developed. The greeneyed monster mentioned by Bela Lugosi's character can be interpreted as Glen's envy of women and their clothing. The seemingly random stock footage of the Buffalo represents the rush that Glen feels when symbolically transformed into Glenda. When realized 'Glen or Glenda' is full of metaphoric meaning and symbolism as well as a fresh plot rife with unique social commentary. 'Glen or Glenda' is a film which does not dance around the subject matter. It recognizes an important at least to director Ed Wood and controversial social issue and discusses it in full leaving nothing left unspoken. The film proves itself to be enjoyable and entertaining to watch throughout with some memorable performances for better or for worse... and an interesting plot. With such originality and such passion Glen or Glenda is a film which should be respected and treasured rather than criticized for its belowaverage acting seemingly strange dialogue and obscure premise for its pure outspoken zealousness in the 1950s a period when transvestism and homosexuality were blatantly not openly accepted. Is this to say that these lifestyles are accepted today? Shall we consult Pat Robertson or perhaps George W. Bush on this matter? The film is just as relevant today as it was in 1953 when it was first released. Glen or Glenda proves to be entertaining and intriguing full of obscure characters and a fresh subject matter a film far ahead of it's time.";

If one does so the film on its merits would have to be rated as fairly terrible given the hilarious convoluted dialog the generally mediocre to poor acting by the cast as well as the zero production values. Yet such an assessment does not capture the absolutely riveting experience of watching this film as it unfolds. It isn't the fact that the subject of the film is transvestitism and that it was a controversial lifestyle choice in the 1950s. It's not even the plea for tolerance of people who embrace alternate life choices that fascinates except as an historic relic.No what makes Glen or Glenda? still a fascinating film after 50 years is that Ed Wood laid his psyche bare in a way that socalled auteur directors like Hitchcock or Godard despite their vastly superior talents never did. In Glen or Glenda Wood isn't afraid to reveal his own deeply conflicted feelings about being a transvestite despite the plea for tolerance for it through out the film. Indeed the conclusion of the film suggest that Ed Wood's Glen character will be able to kill his Glenda female counterpart by transferring the feelings of love and affection Glen has for his feminine counterpart to his future wife Barbara. The psychiatrist even reassures Glen and Barbara that as Glen makes that psychic transference Glenda will disappear. So while Wood could plead for tolerance of transvestites in general he wasn't so sure of desiring it for himself.Moreover Wood wasn't afraid of throwing everything else that crossed his mind on the screen. He did it with whatever stock footage he could get his hands on. If it didn't cohere so what? What the viewer saw in Glen or Glenda especially was Ed Wood's imaginative world in all of its fundamental strangeness.The only comment I wish to add to my comment above is that my twostar rating is based solely on the objective evaluation criteria cited in the first paragraph. The oddly memeric effect the film has despite its technically atrocious qualities I don't think can be rated.".

	schema:reviewBody "and generally speaking you will eventually have to research this little gem. When describing I Changed My Sex or Glen Or Glenda as it is better known I must echo the thoughts of Andrew Smith who so hit the nail on the head when he wrote If you haven't seen any of Ed Wood's other movies this one is a completely bewildering experience. If you have seen any of Ed Wood's movies this is still completely bewildering. The film is both hilarious and tragic yet it moves with a strange rhythm of its own that leaves one in no doubt that its author knows and means every word he is saying during its running length. Wood bless him had some of the loftiest ambitions as a director wanting to promote peace understanding and even acceptance in the 1950s of all times. When Tim Burton recreated a viewing of Glen Or Glenda by studio execs for his biopic he showed the execs laughing and telling each other that this had to be a puton. More than fifty years later there are still people fighting just to be given the kind of respect that the normal take for granted so I say it most certainly is not.No the real comedy in Glen Or Glenda is the sheer ineptitude Wood displays in composing his message. Directors frequently use stock footage when they can find some that suits their purposes and can be edited to fit with their own footage. Ed Wood used stock footage indiscriminately and Tim Burton's biopic celebrated the fact with a scene in which Wood as played by Johnny Depp bets that he could make an entire film out of stock footage. Sadly the real Ed Wood died before he had a chance but Glen Or Glenda is the closest he ever came. The IMDb states that twenty percent of this sixtysomething minute film is stock footage and it is never difficult to guess which footage. Footage of busy highways planes flying overhead poor lightning effects soldiers doing their thing they're all used in a haphazard manner sometimes repeatedly and they often only have a loose connection to the story Wood is trying to tell. Had Wood been able to sit back and think about what he is trying to do for a while there is no telling what kind of heights he could have achieved.Wood himself appears in the film as the titular character a confused transvestite who imagines himself as a woman named Glenda. Aside from the daring manner in which he attempts to make his point Wood makes one hideous woman. Having found myself out on the fringe of a society that thinks I am disabled and need to be cured myself I honestly found myself hoping for the best outcome for Wood's character. In order to make his point however Wood weaves in short stories of two other transvestites. One of them takes the extreme step of enduring a sex change in order to become a woman the other finds himself so disenfranchised that he fears being arrested again so much he commits suicide. The scary thing about this film is that if you edited out the transvestism and substituted such disenfranchisements as my position on the autistic spectrum or such things as schizophrenia very little of the film would even need to be changed. That is how little society has learned since Ed Wood was a boy.The other significant personality in Glen Or Glenda is Bela Lugosi whom Wood shoehorned into the film. Speculation varies upon Wood's motives but the accepted theory is that Wood wanted to help revive Lugosi's career and would do anything in order to achieve this. With the exception of taking his time to carefully construct a good film that is. In Glen Or Glenda Wood makes usage of Lugosi that was best described in Flying Saucers Over Hollywood as bizarre. Lugosi plays a character billed as The Scientist but comes off more as an omnipotent puppet master. People who have not seen Ed Wood films before the biopic will think Tim Burton made up the beware of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep speech. If anything Burton was being restrained about which bizarre speech to use in depicting Woodian dialogue. Nothing can prepare you for seeing the speeches in their original context not even Criswell's hilarious ranting during Plan 9 From Outer Space.Observant types will also note the presence of Delores Fuller Wood's girlfriend at the time. Again Burton dramatises her reaction to seeing the script for the first time whereas the film portrays her as being accepting and forwardthinking. I cannot help but feel that Burton's portrayal is more accurate as Fuller looks extremely uncomfortable in her role. She only appears for about fifteen minutes but her delivery seems so mechanical so lifeless that she somehow manages to seem less talented than her castmates if such a thing is possible. Whether Wood's direction was betterfocused in this case than usual is hard to determine but if the ability of the support cast to leave the stars with the obvious exception of Bela in the dust is any guide then it should come as no surprise that Fuller would only appear in a very small role within one other Wood film. That she went on to write a number of hit songs tells you she made the right decision to stay behind the camera. While Wood would appear before the camera again it was never as more than a cameo a walkon or a bitpart.I gave Glen Or Glenda a one out of ten. I generally only give this rating to films that are so bad they become entertaining as a result. Bold and wellintentioned as it was Glen Or Glenda fits that description to a T.".

	onyx:emotionText "and generally speaking you will eventually have to research this little gem. When describing I Changed My Sex or Glen Or Glenda as it is better known I must echo the thoughts of Andrew Smith who so hit the nail on the head when he wrote If you haven't seen any of Ed Wood's other movies this one is a completely bewildering experience. If you have seen any of Ed Wood's movies this is still completely bewildering. The film is both hilarious and tragic yet it moves with a strange rhythm of its own that leaves one in no doubt that its author knows and means every word he is saying during its running length. Wood bless him had some of the loftiest ambitions as a director wanting to promote peace understanding and even acceptance in the 1950s of all times. When Tim Burton recreated a viewing of Glen Or Glenda by studio execs for his biopic he showed the execs laughing and telling each other that this had to be a puton. More than fifty years later there are still people fighting just to be given the kind of respect that the normal take for granted so I say it most certainly is not.No the real comedy in Glen Or Glenda is the sheer ineptitude Wood displays in composing his message. Directors frequently use stock footage when they can find some that suits their purposes and can be edited to fit with their own footage. Ed Wood used stock footage indiscriminately and Tim Burton's biopic celebrated the fact with a scene in which Wood as played by Johnny Depp bets that he could make an entire film out of stock footage. Sadly the real Ed Wood died before he had a chance but Glen Or Glenda is the closest he ever came.

It's like a highschool hygiene lecture wrapped in soft porno all tossed into a surrealist dream. Really Wood had all the guts in the world to lecture a 1950's audience on the subtleties of gender bending. That part is genuinely informative and worth a salute. I also liked the soft porn with the squirming girls in semiundress. But I'm still wondering how that got released in 1953. Then there's Lugosi sitting in some corner of the surrealist universe telling us to Bevare of puppy dog tails and other hammy nonsense. I figure he was added for marquee value since the rest of the cast are a bunch of unknowns. But what's this thing Wood has for lightning bolts. It's like he says Stop the action it's time for a lightning bolt and makes just about that much sense. One thing for sureyou never know what's coming next. It might be a stampede of buffalo or a stroll down Ventura Blvd. in drag. And my gosh Wood Glen and Glenda looks so normal you'd never guess he makes Salvador Dali seem absolutely conventional. I don't know what part of planet Wacko Wood hails from but I do know it's no part of the known universe. Nonetheless here's a fuzzy angora Oscar to Wood for just plain weirdness.".

Ed Wood's infamy in the film world leads to a particular form of expectation in cult circuits that sometimes gives prejudice in places where it's not due though I'm not going to argue that Plan 9 from Outer Space isn't terrible... I'll write a review of that one next but I think Glen or Glenda? shows that there may be a lot from Wood we're taking for granted.Not to say this is a good or even great film by any means. It's real problem lies in the fact that despite Ed Wood's own wellnoted transvestitism this movie was made in a time when such issues were taboo enough to be misunderstood even by those who suffered from it. Glen or Glenda? is Ed Wood's personal journey into his own doublelife which involves among other things questioning woman's role in society gender politics and psychoanalysis. The absurd and random cutting through different viewpoints narratives and devices actually work FOR Wood's own confusion... the movie itself is as schizophrenic as people's opinions about the subject the movie is portraying.The second real reason why Glen or Glenda? fails simply has to do with the horror genre itself. Wood uses horror tropes to express himself when this movie would be a lot more successful as a drama with most of the same dialog... though nothing changes the fact that the dialog could have been delivered much better. Bela Lugosi's role especially stands out in stark contrast to the rest of the film which at times goes through documentary or cinema veritelike melodramatic war and psychoanalytical concepts at a dizzying pace. Actually as I see it Lugosi's character is comparable to The Man in the Planet from Eraserhead or the Emcee from Cabaret a separate somewhat metaphysical entity that comments in its own way upon the more diegetic elements of the rest of the film.Otherwise despite a very vague sense of misogyny Glen or Glenda? is remarkably successful at detailing the anxiety and confusion felt by transvestites of various personalities. It's notsosubtle arguments for transvestism are laughable but they're more reasonable than I think many people are willing to admit. Had this movie been done by more capable hands it could have become an immensely important document but on another level Wood's own campy quality reflects the sort of underground sentiment and misassociation inherent in its own subject matter.PolarisDiB".

This movie almost defies description. Told in semidocudrama style with an unseen narrator explaining the plot ... such as it is ... the story revolves around the vicissitudes of a man named Glen Ed Wood Jr. who crossdresses hence the reference to Glenda. The film has no real structure. Instead it consists mostly of a random assortment of vignettes that may ... or may not ... relate to Glen or to the crossdressing motif. One long sequence consists of some unknown woman wriggling on a sofa followed by a man whipping a woman in what we would today refer to as SM.Then at odd moments Bela reappears for no apparent reason and babbles more inane dialogue like When he's wrong because he does right and when he's right because he does wrong pull the string dance to that. Huh?About twenty percent of the film's visuals consist of stock footage accompanied by a VO that relates to the story motif but not the visuals. Hence we see stock footage of bustling city streets freeway traffic a thunderous herd of buffalo and a playground full of kids. But it gets worse. In a film about crossdressing we have 58 consecutive seconds of stock footage of a foundry furnace making hot steel and 84 consecutive seconds of battle scenes from WWII.Even the simplest items are botched. In one scene we see a newspaper headline that reads Man Nabbed Dressed as Girl. Underneath the headline which has clearly been glued or pasted on the article is about ... taxes. In one of my favorite scenes an offscreen woman spouts out airplanes why it's against the creator's will in a voice that sounds like she's just inhaled helium.Except for the performance of Lyle Talbot the acting is uniformly horrendous. Production design is cheap looking and drab but you gotta love that tacky wallpaper. The editing is sloppy. Most of the background music is suitable only for 1950 style elevators. The BW cinematography has way too much contrast. And the costumes look like something that came from a thrift store.This film is so bad it makes Plan 9 From Outer Space look like Citizen Kane by comparison. I just don't know how one could make a film any worse than Ed Wood's Glen Or Glenda. But thankfully it's got Bela Lugosi in it. Every time he opened his mouth and gazed into the camera with those big bulging eyes I about fell on the floor laughing.".

	schema:reviewBody "For the 1950's Edward Wood was incredibly brave to make this movie about transvestites and sex change  dealing with two taboo subjects. It was made with real passion by someone who understood the issue but it can be quite off the wall and dull but its a hell of a lot more intelligent than a lot of the rubbish made today and costing millions of dollars to make. The opening message of Glen or Glenda reminds me of the opening message of Tod Browning's classic 1932 horror film Freaks. The first part of the film begins with a narrator Bela Lugosi making cryptic comments about humanity. In a way Bela Lugosi plays the creator watching the people moving by their own making their own decisions. Pull the Strings' meant everyone puppeteer is the master of their own destiny puppets by pulling the strings so as to control your destiny and bring it wherever you want it to be. These theological ruminations Ed Wood gives us are right up there with Ingmar Bergman's greatest films on the purpose of life and faith in our world. Edward Wood wanted to keep it open to religions who don't believe in the commonly accepted God or do not call their gods God. The Creator is an umbrella term that doesn't offend any particular religion or belief set nor does it truly suggest religion in the first place The Creator could be anybody or anything. This way he doesn't directly accuse religion for people not accepting transsexualism and transvestism rather he accuses people's stubbornness. The Bela Lugosi portions of the movie seem like such an afterthought to the central story which is too bad considering that they are also the most compelling. He put Bela in the film because at the time the old man was sick addicted to drugs and badly in need of money and he loved Lugosi so he tried to help him whenever he could. Sadly Bela wasn't in any shape to memorize the ingredients for an ice cube let alone a movie script even a bad one. The lines were feed to him but some lines still didn't match what was being produce half of the scenes Bisons running around in stockfootage is a example. Maybe a example of not being trampled by life or others. Another one is 'The Dragon at the doorstep' is maybe the mockery people must fight against to be what he wants to be. Puppy dog tails and big fat snails are the transvestites of the world getting eaten destroyed by the Dragon mockery from people. The examples of people excuse for sex change introcut with having cars and planes are just out there. This film has artistic merit to it with those lines. With Bela on film the audience has a hard time figuring out who is the true narrator due to another narrator later in the film. So it's felt like a story within a story. This part seem like a horror film while the rest of the film seems like one of those better ways towards clean living type of short films made in the fifties that they showed to kids in school only instead of promoting personal hygiene this one is showing you how to justify your life as a transvestite.The film proper opens with Inspector Warren finding the corpse of a male transvestite named PatrickPatricia who has committed suicide. Wanting to know more about crossdressing Warren seeks out Dr. Alton who narrates for him the story of GlenGlenda and the viewers. Ed Wood himself was a transvestite playing Glen under the pseudonym 'Daniel Davis'. Glen is shown studying women's clothes in a shop window. Dr. Alton points out that men's clothes are dull and restrictive whereas women can adorn themselves with attractive clothing with outrageous bizarre claims. Women's clothes comfy? In the days of the Iron Bra and the panty girdle? Glen is getting married to Barbara Ed's real life girlfriend Dolores Fuller who questioning if Glen is with another woman. Glen is being force to admit to Barbara about his wanting to wear women clothing. A bizarre dream sequence containing some BDSM pornography follows with Satan. Not really need. It ruins the film. Glen then decides to tell Barbara the truth. She proffers her angora sweater as a sign of acceptance. The second part of the story about Alan Annie is a letdown not worth noting. The acting is quite poor with different actors you can spot Ed Wood's trademark dialogue style.It's this type of pseudointellectual verbal nonstop talk that erupts from their mouths for no reason at all. Much like a person reading a book outloud there is an unnaturalness to it because we know deep down in the depths of the human mind that humans such as us do not talk like characters in a audio book. The random shots of things like dramatic radiator are just odd to be in the film. Looking through the opening credits it included a Music Consultant rather than composer or director. I have no idea what a consultant would be needed for unless the music he used in this movie was canned or public domain. Found out it's the old theme song as the old Lassie TV show. The dub lines in postproduction is funny. That phony granny voice is one thing that's laughable. Unfortunately the film doesn't broach the subject that gender Diaspora  transvestism aren't the same thing. Ed Wood who was probably a very nice man but a not that good film maker. Working with what he had on a low budget with a script he had to write in less than 2 days with production starting not long after to say this was horrible is a understatement. It wasn't that bad. It actually seems pretty progressive for 1953. Rather watch a flaw film made with lots of enthusiasm than a mundane manufactured movie anyday. Just my opinion.".

By saying they're bad automatically I'm not being facetious Wood's movies are to independent cinema what John Cassavetes was in his own right to the same movement. They made their marks and have been noted in history as the grandfathers of their particular mold. Whereas Cassavetes was a master at relationships and probing the mind and heart and soul of people Wood was... not exactly. And yet there's no denying that he was original  just not entirely talented.Certainly as a screenwriter he had all of the trademarks of someone who shouldn't try and write  forced exposition crummy bits of polemic stuff no real ear for dialog short of onedimensional molds  and yet at the same time there's moments in Glen or Glenda perhaps unintentionally that appear brilliant. The Beware speech repeated a few times first by Scientist Bela Lugosi who was put in the film just for the purpose of having a mad scientist who is maybe like a God or something in this world is howlingly funny certainly more inspired than any of the banter between the policeman and the psychologist.And yet... I couldn't tear myself away from the screen and unlike another Wood stinker such as The Sinister Urge I didn't really need the Mystery Science Theater guys as backup. There's a perverse energy to the picture something weird and eerie and dark and brooding and all of those things that should make art. Maybe it is there's a midsection in the picture when Wood splices in random footage of tying up a woman to a couch and other things involving females undressing with Lugosi and Wood himself spliced in to ogle that displays a filmmaker who has something going on something direct and primal to his audience. I almost wished that the movie were better because of it as though there's the surface of a surreal masterwork that can never be scratched deeply enough before the movie returns to its crapinformational diatribes about transvestites and hermaphrodites.It's neither a disappointment or something I'd really recommend  unless to those friends of mine wondering why an Ed Wood movie is listed as one of David Lynch's favorites. Not surprising it has 50s sex and desire and nightmare all over it. It's like a student who writes a C paper that can never be improved at all and it's the best we'll get yet there are those kernels that keep it from failure.".

It is different from Ed Wood's other work such as Bride of the Atom Plan 9 from Outer Space Night of the Ghouls. There are no mistakes or bad dialogue. The story line is somewhat interesting. A man torn between love and transvestitism. Ed stars in this but does not give a bad performance. He acts very believable. That's the way I think an actor should act. Dolores Fuller isn't as believable but still manages to act out some good scenes with Ed. This movie most definitely did not deserve the beating it got during its release. Warren Beatty was able to see what an overlooked movie it was and convinced Paramount to rerelease it. That is until the George Weiss estate bought the rights back. Bela Lugosi is good in his minor but pleasing role. I think this whole movie is very interesting and fun. But there is this particular scene of girls stripping every few seconds and Bela Lugosi looking at them. I think that is one scene that went on for just too long. I wasn't too fond of the last half. The character Glen's situation was watchable and good enough to keep watching but when you get to a character named Alan in the end it just got dragged on.But I still do highly recommend this. If you are a fan of Edward D. Wood Jr. check this movie out. Or if you respect Ed's work check it out. It is definitely good to add to your Ed Wood collection. If you're just looking to watch an interesting fun and watchable movie check this out. If you've seen this movie on T.V. years back late at night forget it. The T.V. quality was horrible. Not to mention the sound. Rent this film".

The important fact is that it isn't an actual story it's more of a semidocumentary party educational picture. Behind the really weird editing the movie tells a lot about transvestitism transsexualism relationships sexual identity and social roles. It's hard to believe that it was made in early 1950s! Not only it was produced significantly before the so called sexual revolution of the '60s but also certain gender issues that were carefully covered in the movie seem to be still beyond the understanding of certain narrowminded and prejudiced people today.I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to get to know Edward Wood and his work and also to people interested in the history of approach to gender studies and the society.".

Bevare of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep. He eats little boys...puppy dog tails and big fat snails. Bevare take care....bevare! Ed Wood Glen or Glenda 1953How to make sense of Ed Wood? There are six alternate titles for this film Glen or Glenda Confessions of Ed Wood Glen or Glenda? He or She I Changed My Sex I Led 2 Lives and The Transvestite.Spoiled milk by any other name...What is important to me is not THAT this film is bad but WHY it is bad and if there is anything salvageable from the experience of watching it. The most significant problem of the film is that it is so deeply personal so internalized for Wood that it is frequently incomprehensible. If there was ever a film that shows the risks of getting too close to the subject matter this is it. Gestures images and dialog from the film have prominence that far outweighs their impact on the viewer. One gets the feeling after a few minutes that the film was made by Wood to explain his own nature to himself and the fact that it was to be seen by others became an unimportant afterthought. For Wood Bela Lugosi reciting a nursery rhyme in a pathetically melodramatic fashion makes perfect sense. I also assume that it made no sense to poor drugaddled Lugosi to any of the other characters or to many of its viewers. A few examples of the film's too subjective too Woodcentric nature all of Lugosi's lines the lightning motif that crashes in at randomthe fake African tribal dance the Betty Page antics in the last half of the film including a pseudorape which is accompanied by polka music. Many scenes indicate a general sense of fear or transgression but they aren't specific enough or clear enough to serve as part of the narrative. They are simply hapless gestures from someone desperate to feel personally validated in public. This makes the filmmaker the subject of pathos and not the characters. As a viewer I empathize more with Ed than Glen. The inept filmmaking distances me from the character of Glen while at the same time eliciting pity for the man who is confronting a source of personal shame by broadcasting it to the world. At times the film is a documentary at times a police drama at times a horror film at times a love story. Wood uses expressionistic sets dream sequences and special effects and crushes them up against images of traffic and steel mills and World War II footage interspersed with monologues by dry professors discussing the current scientific understanding of transvestites. Given all this ineptitude one has to ask is it worth viewing even as kitsch? I would say so. One learns as much by bad examples as by good. One could easily assemble a howto' book on narrative filmmaking using just this film as a negative example. Pick a topic with gravity. Consider your audience. Don't humiliate your actors by giving them nonsensical scripts. Pick music that supports the action. And never underestimate the power of a good laugh.".

Ed Wood Glen or Glenda 1953How to make sense of Ed Wood? There are six alternate titles for this film Glen or Glenda Confessions of Ed Wood Glen or Glenda? He or She I Changed My Sex I Led 2 Lives and The Transvestite.Spoiled milk by any other name...What is important to me is not THAT this film is bad but WHY it is bad and if there is anything salvageable from the experience of watching it. The most significant problem of the film is that it is so deeply personal so internalized for Wood that it is frequently incomprehensible. If there was ever a film that shows the risks of getting too close to the subject matter this is it. Gestures images and dialog from the film have prominence that far outweighs their impact on the viewer. One gets the feeling after a few minutes that the film was made by Wood to explain his own nature to himself and the fact that it was to be seen by others became an unimportant afterthought. For Wood Bela Lugosi reciting a nursery rhyme in a pathetically melodramatic fashion makes perfect sense. I also assume that it made no sense to poor drugaddled Lugosi to any of the other characters or to many of its viewers. A few examples of the film's too subjective too Woodcentric nature all of Lugosi's lines the lightning motif that crashes in at randomthe fake African tribal dance the Betty Page antics in the last half of the film including a pseudorape which is accompanied by polka music. Many scenes indicate a general sense of fear or transgression but they aren't specific enough or clear enough to serve as part of the narrative. They are simply hapless gestures from someone desperate to feel personally validated in public. This makes the filmmaker the subject of pathos and not the characters. As a viewer I empathize more with Ed than Glen. The inept filmmaking distances me from the character of Glen while at the same time eliciting pity for the man who is confronting a source of personal shame by broadcasting it to the world. At times the film is a documentary at times a police drama at times a horror film at times a love story. Wood uses expressionistic sets dream sequences and special effects and crushes them up against images of traffic and steel mills and World War II footage interspersed with monologues by dry professors discussing the current scientific understanding of transvestites. Given all this ineptitude one has to ask is it worth viewing even as kitsch? I would say so. One learns as much by bad examples as by good. One could easily assemble a howto' book on narrative filmmaking using just this film as a negative example. Pick a topic with gravity. Consider your audience. Don't humiliate your actors by giving them nonsensical scripts. Pick music that supports the action. And never underestimate the power of a good laugh.";

However even if he had been competent enough to manage that I doubt that 1953 was ready for any statement about crossdressing. The film is so badly made that it's a hoot!

	schema:reviewBody "Tangled is an apt description of this film. It jumps around in both time and point of view so that you never really have a clear view of what actually happens in the climax.The one thing that kept going through my mind while watching Tangled was that if Rachel Leigh Cook's Lanie Boggs from She's all That had gone off to college convinced that she was now attractive to boys she would have grown into the neurotic annoying Jenny Kelly she plays in this film. Like Lanie Jenny is pretentious arty and self involved. She does however have a doting admirer in David a shy boy planning to become a writer who appears to be charmed by Jenny's bohemian pseudo intellectual ways.David makes the mistake of introducing Jenny to his wacko exroommate Alan one of those guys who is apparently irresistible to women. Alan is better or at least more dramatic looking than David. He also appears strongly inclined towards a criminal career which probably makes him a 'bad boy'. In any case Alan moves in on Jenny posing nude for her and dragging her off to 'adventures' in the woods. For some strange reason this dysfunctional group becomes a threesome with Alan and Jenny tormenting David with their romantic activities. I have never seen a crueler scene in a film than when Alan asks David to give him and Jenny 15 minutes alone while they are walking back to their car from an adventure in an abandoned house where something nasty took place in the past involving a good son and a prodigal son.At this point sunshine temporarily enters this dreary film as Alan sets up David with Elise Estella Warren a big funny sexy girl who originally thinks Alan is asking her out but manages to respond well when she discovers she has made a date with David instead. Many people have disparaged Estella Warren as an actress but in the scene in the caf with David when she realizes he is her date Estella Warren does more acting using her face alone than Rachel Leigh Cook does in the entire film. Watching Warren's look change from disappointment to embarrassment to pity to sympathy in the space of a minute shows a genuine sense of how human emotions work. Later as Elise and David walk and talk Elise's self deprecating humor and ability to poke gentle fun at David's pretensions mark her as a keeper at least to me.Spoiler alert Instead of thanking his lucky stars that a girl like Elise would be interested in him David remains obsessed with Jenny. Jenny catches Alan and Elise together in flagrante delicto apparently like Ado Annie Elise is a girl who can't say no causing Jenny to throw a monumental but very arty hissy fit. This serves to draw David and Jenny together especially after Alan is arrested for possession with intent to distribute. Alan is convinced that Jenny set him up out of jealousyand he plots his revenge during his year in prison. Turns out however that David is not quite the wimp he appears to be. He used Elise to set up Alan and then turns in Alan so he can have the rebounding Jenny to himself.Everything culminates a year or so later in the abandoned house where David shoots Alan either to protect himself and Jenny the official version or from anger the apparent true version because as he says After all I did for her she still wanted the ahole. At least at this point most men in the audience will feel sympathy with David.".

	schema:reviewBody "While I found this suspensethriller to be rather mediocre in many ways I am glad to say this film did manage to keep my attention for its hour and a half or so duration.'Tangled' was a film I had never heard of before but rented it on the basis of a decent cast especially Rachael Leigh Cook and the fact there was nothing else interesting at the store which I had not seen already. It has a very low budget feel to it as if this could really have been a made for TV movie. It's basically a fairly typical teen film light plot suspect acting in places and just about entertaining enough. The film in the most part is told in flashbacks and concerns a three way relationship between friends Jenny Cook Alan RhysMeyers and David Hatosy as told by David. The film starts with Jenny and David as close friends boardering on lovers but things take a very different and sinister turn when Alan comes on the scene. The film was very very similar to the 1995 film 'Fear' starring Mark Wahlberg and Reese Witherspoon. In this movie RhysMeyers essentially plays Wahlberg's character Cook plays Witherspoon's character Estelle Warren plays Alyssa Milano's character and Hatosy plays a similar role to that of Witherspoon's father in Fear though his character is more jealous than overprotective. This is a little better than 'Fear' though.There were a number of things I liked about the film. The cinematography was nice and also varied  both warm and vibrant early in the film and dark and cold when things take a downward turn. The way in which the events are told through flashbacks of different times and using varying amonts of colour though not particularly original Usual Suspects Traffic does at least make it intersting and a little different from the rest of its market. I also liked the fact that Rachael Leigh Cook for once plays a relitively sexy character rather than her usual 'cute but slightly dorky' ones which have become her trademark She's all That All I Wanna Do Antitrust etc. There were a few scenes where the director tries to be a little deeper and metaphorical e.g. kite scene sitting on car scene and the story about the brothers but I felt these scenes suffered from lack of subtlety especially the kite scene. Still I liked the fact he tried them.I do have a number of critisisms though. Firstly the plot can be a little slow at times which may not be to everyones tastes. Secondly while the acting in the most part was OK there were a few times e.g. Cook's 'shocked and surprised' face in the first 10 minutes which left me and the guys I was watching it with chuckling. Also the 'twist' ending is very predictable and we had the whole second half of the movie figured out within the first twenty minutes. Still theres at least a sense of contentment when things come together on screen how you predicted them.Overall this is a mixed bag and not bad for a 1st time directorial effort  a mediocre but interesting suspense thriller which is worth a watch if you see it on TV.Rating 610".

Also the 'twist' ending is very predictable and we had the whole second half of the movie figured out within the first twenty minutes. Still theres at least a sense of contentment when things come together on screen how you predicted them.Overall this is a mixed bag and not bad for a 1st time directorial effort  a mediocre but interesting suspense thriller which is worth a watch if you see it on TV.Rating 610";

All the three actors do their best to conceal the catastrophic weaknesses of the screenplay. They fail yet raising interest in themselves Rachel Leigh Cook is sweet Jonathan RhysMeyers is a decent maniac and Shawn Hatosy is perfectly natural as the miserable good son. I hope the actors really got a lot of money for this film. So much for the positive aspects.Right from the start the film fails to build up any suspense or even interest in the allegedly mysterious events that go on in the flashbacks. The mix of characters is much too arbitrary to form an attractive plot so the way they act is stupid and not at all convincing. Single scenes are highly overdirected by use of dramatic music and even more dramatic oneliners. I was prepared for a plot twist but then the film was over and I realized I had missed that plot twist. This is even too bad for television.".

This movie was NOT Interesting and Not Interesting enough to want me to see it more than twice. I only watched this movie twice so I could give it a chance may be I missed something...nope I didn't miss anything nor did it require my watching it again...The acting was below par for all three main characters and the rest of the cast. Rachael Leigh Cook didn't act she just read her lines Shawn Hatosy looked like he was reading his lines and Jonathan Rhys Meyers well I'll give him this much he can dance and he seems to like movies where he portrays a weirdo andor he can show off whatever part of his bodyanatomy he can. As for the rest of the cast Lorraine Bracco seemed bored with her character and only slightly interested in what she was saying. With the way these actors were trying to act it's a no wonder this movie got off the ground and was released.Without giving away too much of the plot this movie was basically a hesaid shesaid with ridiculous plot twists and flashbacks to what supposedly happened and what actually happened. The so called good boyShawn Hatosy as David is actually bad the devil may care boy Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Alan is actually good and the girlRachael Leigh Cook as Jenny is basically a stupid blondeinsert all dumb blonde jokes here disguising herself as a brunette. And of course Lorraine Bracco as Anne Andersle seemed bored and for want of a better word she is a bit dead pan. By the time the first flashback finishes you get the idea that this is a hesaid shesaid type movie and realize that not all is as it seems. When you see the next flashback you finally realize that David has some problems and is probably the reason why he is hurt and that he is a liar. At this time you just want to turn away and say enough is enough. Unfortunately I tried to give this movie a chance twice...wrong answer I should have walked away when I could have! This movie was basically PREDICTABLE and BORING!!! The storyline was a waste of time and the acting oh I'm sorry there was NO ACTING just pathetic excuses for reading lines in a script!!!DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS MOVIE IT IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND SHOULD BE DESTROYED!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I have a habit of enjoying small scale thrillers and figured Tangled looked good enough for me to spend some of my precious time on. Well not only is this film not good enough to warrant using up ninety minutes of my time it's arguably not even a thriller seeing as the movie features nothing in the way of suspense and doesn't make up for that with anything interesting about the characters or the situation. This is actually a real shame because the base of this movie is good and could easily have lead into something worthwhile but the writers clearly weren't talented enough to capitalise on the promise. The plot focuses on a love triangle between three young people and as the film starts one of the triangle has been admitted to hospital with plenty of bumps and bruises. He gets questioned by the police and the film then cuts to flashbacks which shows us what happened in the build up to him being beaten up and put in hospital. Turns out that there's a girl named Jenny at the bottom of it and this starts a rivalry between two friends.The choice to have the film cutting back from flashbacks all the time was a big mistake it's really annoying and means that the film doesn't flow very well which certainly affects it in terms of tension and suspense. A film like this therefore really needs to have strong characters to work from but it doesn't. None of the three central ones are really fleshed out and I didn't believe their relationships either. The three central cast members are not particularly good they're not helped by the script in fairness but the performances are nothing special anyway. This is only the second time I've seen Rachael Leigh Cook in anything Get Carter remake being the first and I doubt I'll be seeking out anything else with her in it. Shawn Hatosy is as wooden as they come while Jonathan Rhys Meyers does put some effort in but doesn't create a convincing character. The first hour is really quite dull and comes off as more of a drama than a thriller. The final third of the film is when the inevitable twist comes into play and while the finale is better than the rest of the film it's really nothing to write home about. Overall Tangled tries it's best to be clever but unfortunately fails and I wouldn't even recommend this as a decent timewaster.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tangled is pretty much an American version of The Hole. The premise setup and characters are very similar and while the setting is different if you've seen The Hole you will instantly notice the correlations between the two.That said I like this movie better. Maybe it's the likable leads maybe it's the fact that the movie is still interesting outside of it's flashbacks but if pushed I'd say Tangled has the edge. It benefits mainly from having a key cast that only numbers 4 characters and concentrating on developing these leads as opposed to confusing matters by adding lots of extras.Tangled is very much a character piece with most of its shocks and twists coming from alterations in behaviour and unexpected actions as opposed to physical violence or graphic visuals. All three teens in the love triangle are initially likable vulnerable characters and it's only as the movie develops that you find some of them are not the people you believe them to be. This slow drip feed of information is addictive and keeps you glued to the screen. Extra credit must go to the three leads Rachel Leigh Cook Shaun Hatosy and Johnathan RhysMeyers for putting in such charismatic performances with Rachel Leigh Cook's twitchy acting style greatly suited to such a role.Most of the movie like The Hole is told in flashback. Where Tangled departs most from The Hole is that the interlocking segments are as full of useful information as the flashbacks. Indeed as the movie progresses more and more hinges on the aftermath of events as opposed to events themselves. This gives the movie a steady sense of development as opposed to the stopstart of most nonlinear narratives and eases your enjoyment of the film.Basically I'd be lying if I said this movie was entirely original. It's very similar to The Hole and it reminded me a lot of American Perfekt in parts as well. However I would still highly recommend it as it is a greatly enjoyable well acted piece that deserves a lot more recognition than it seems to be getting given it's only just come out in Britain this year but was made 4 years ago. Go find a copy stick it in your VCR and get watching.".

I mean is the director of this movie so shallow he has to steal form other movies and that movie happens to be an Indian movie as well. For shame for shame. At first I thought it was a coincidence but after watching this movie and watching that Idnian film form before I have to say that the 2005 Indian movie and Tangled are like identical twins but this is the older one.

A common problem in real life but seldom in noncomedy movies the other guy likes Rachael but of course he keeps this buried and quietly accepts the fact that Rachael wants and belongs to the other guy. But things can change.......There is a 1 minute 43 second scene which I've lifted from the movie and show people as Almost Two Minutes in Paradise  one man's dream is fulfilled after a 2 year effort including betrayal and literally stabbing his best friend in the back Rachael wakes up and after kissing the guy on the cheek begins a ragging fit screeching about her not finding her cigarettes. When her Marlboro's are found after numerous 4 letter words and slamming around the seizure stops and she coyly smiles in the young man's face. True happiness! Great moments are NOT romantic moonlit walks on the beach. Such ideas are for shallow losers. Great romantic moments are being with a 90 lb spitfire full of life overloading your heart ragging on a guy at 8 AM before the coffee's had time to drip.".

Maybe the scenario is not that shiny and the whole concept could have been processed in a much more impressive way but still it's a fine piece.The story tells about the love triangle of young American high school students. The warmhearted David Shawn Hatosy secretly admires his best friend beautiful photographer Jenny Rachel Leigh Cook. When David's old friend crazy and attractive heedless Alan comes on the scene Jenny falls in love with him. How will David deal with it? Especially Rhys Meyers did a good job. He's also very cute. Everybody has to love him as the beautiful and uncontrollable heartthrob Alan. The movie has an interesting cut sometimes. The story is perceived from retrospective and has a surprising ending. It's nothing intellectual or sophisticated surely not artistic and not as complicated as it might look. But if you just want to relax and get amused and if you like some of the lead actors starring here you should watch it.".

I liked the multiple flashback way the events leading up to where the film opens were gradually pieced together.I felt the plot of this film had an underlying theme in that it incorporated an exploration of the dynamics of how these two male characters employ different tactics in competing for Jenny Kelley's Rachael Leigh Cook's affections. In short there's an 'in depth' study in particular of David Klein's Shawn Hatosy's character.Finally similar to what I think has already been observed in an earlier comment I thought several scenes excellently captured the unpredictable spontaneity in the various ways in which passionate love can sometimes evolve.".

However she passes the mark here. And shows that she has some sex appeal. Just for proof she is better than Estella Warren here who is a complete bore...Shawn Hatosy is a bit weak in the role of David but Jonathan RhysMeyer steals the show as Alan here. Hoping this guy gets better roles one day as he shines here. Even I would say he was better than Ms.Cook which I am a fan... Good job also by Lorraine Bracco that we never see often in motion pictures I remember her in Medecine Man and GoodFellas....The script is good and the Toronto settings are quite convenient just wondering if the story is settled in the U.S. or Toronto itself. The movie is quite entertaining and of much better fare than those Based on a true story type films...Watch it if you like watching a story built like a good jigsaw puzzle in which the end might surprise you !".
