But there will be no celebration at all because their beloved patriarch has been murdered! The killer can only be one of the eight women closest to the man of the house. Was it his powerful wife? His spinster sisterinlaw? His miserly motherinlaw? Maybe the insolent chambermaid or the loyal housekeeper? Could it possibly have been one of his two young daughters? A surprise visit from the victim's chic sister sends the household into a tizzy encouraging hysterics exacerbating rivalries and encompassing musical interludes. Comedic situations arise with the revelations of dark family secrets. Seduction dances with betrayal. The mystery of the female psyche is revealed. There are eight women and each is a suspect. Each has a motive. Each has a secret. Beautiful tempestuous intelligent sensual and dangerous...one of them is guilty. Which one is it?";

But actually it's a huge playground  for the actresses who get the chance to play with the stereotypes attached to them and for director Franois Ozon to toy with the clichs of the whodunit.Here's the setup 1950s. A beautiful mansion. A man is found lying in his bed with a knife in his back. The possible suspects His wife his two daughters his sister his motherinlaw his sisterinlaw the chambermaid and the cook. As these eight women can't leave the estate or call the police they try to find the murderer themselves. We know this situation from countless Agatha Christiestories.But what Ozon makes of this situation is just incredible. It already begins with the casting Who else could play the gentrified Gaby if not Catherine Deneuve? Is there any actress who would fit more perfectly for the role of the spinsterish sister than Isabelle Huppert? Who else would you want to walk around in that dress of a chambermaid than the most desirable Emmanuelle Bart? The actresses are eagerly playing with the stereotypes that surround them because of both the roles they played and their private lives.Then there's the story All whodunits have those obligatory scenes where the motives of all characters are revealed. '8 Women' takes that formula and deliberately goes over the top with it it's characters are unfaithful pregnant lesbian poisoners and many things more. And as a final twist the film stops eight times to give each of its protagonists a chance to reveal her true character in a scene entirely devoted to them  singing and dancing. There is also another scene worth mentioning that is entirely dedicated to the actresses A scene with a lot of dialog that entirely consists of nothing but a series of closeups  and that for about three minutes.Cinephiles can enjoy this film on even another level The film is filled with references to beloved classics. Consider Fanny Ardant's musical number which pays homage to Rita Hayworth's glovestrip in 'Gilda' and another Rita Hayworthmoment so wonderful I won't reveal it here. Consider Emmanuelle Barts hairstyle that echoes Kim Novak in 'Vertigo'. Consider the fact that the late husband of the Dannielle Darrieux character was a general reminding us of 'Madame de...'. Or consider the painting of the young Catherine Deneuve hanging in one room  a replica of a 'Belle de jour'poster. All this is supported by the rich colorful cinematography the art direction and the costumes that give the entire film a 1950s look.But attention If you give this film a chance don't expect it to be logically consistent. It isn't. But that doesn't matter at all. The murder mystery story is replaceable. The film is entirely devoted to its brilliant actresses and the wonderful bitchy dialog they exchange. It's great fun and it is getting better with every viewing.".

Lesbianism twisted love triangles chic couture wardrobes transformations from ugly duckling to swan. And last but not least musical numbers. The action stops for each woman to dance and sing usually in a breathy untrained voice a pop song that reveals her character's emotional state.

Almost as good is Ardant playing a surprisingly likable freespirited bad girl because her character has no shame she's at least honest when all the other women tell lies.The lesserknown Firmine Richard gets one of the best musical numbers with Pour ne pas vivre seul So as not to live alone and Sagnier who was in her early twenties when she filmed the movie very convincingly plays a bratty 16yearold.All of the actresses' roles allow them to satirize their own or others' personas Bart sends up the seductive French maid stereotype Ledoyen is costumed to look like Audrey Hepburn but her character is no girlish innocent Deneuve plays a variation on her customary chilly glamorous bourgeois matron.

The basic plot is that 8 related women find themselves in the same place at approximately the same time when the lone man is presumed to be murdered who happens to be the grandfather father husband bearer of child lover etc of the womennot necessarily in that order. You talk about complexity of plot? Every time someone opens their mouth another twist is thrown into the mix. I think it would take at least another viewing to understand everyone's relationship with everyone else by the end of the movie. And besides this musical numbers are thrown in to help us understand the characters that are sung by themselves and sometimes backed up by the rest of the castala Bollywood. One thing I have always noticed about French movies is that they come across as a confused people but they're OK with that instead of the American's who believe that they have the answers to everything. This makes it slightly uncomfortable for us pompous Americans to view movies like this where every real thing in life is kind of taken with a little tongueincheek mentality but this is the reality of their people and it's present often in their movies. Good for them!! This is so evident in this movie where because of it's mystery plot we think that who did the killing is what's important but what we find out is that there is much more behind the socalled answer we're seeking which makes for a very complex experience.

	schema:headline " I saw the future of French cinema and its name is Franois Ozon!";
	schema:reviewBody "A movie launched in 2002 8 femmes was the establishing movie for Franois Ozon. Through his movies from his mediumlength film See the Sea 1997 to 8 women 2002 to the criminal lovers 1999 he developed his own style based on surprise. In short his aim is to surprise the spectator. With this movie we can say that he reached his goal and it is probably his most accomplished movie. It is also a movie that confirms the originality of his cinema.First of all 8 women is a movie that surprises by its tone breaks. It means that Ozon passes from drama to comedy with great ease just like Jaco Van Dormael with Toto the Hero 1991. As for the songs they are totally unexpected. Which other director would have included musical numbers in a detective movie?As for the influences of the movie they are numerous. Of course this film is an adaptation from a play that evokes the Agatha Christie universe but Ozon felt like scattering his movie with all kinds of allusions Vincente Minelli Douglas Sirk the deer in the garden. These allusions are especially linked to French culture the French TV program au thtre ce soir but also Jacques Demy the bright colors the songs and French cinema before the new wave. More than allusions they are tributes from a director who once said I don't care about newwave.Franois Ozon also plays with the spectator a bit like Herg with the Tintin album the Castafiore Emerald. He holds him spellbound until the end of the film either by leading him on wrong tracks either by giving him clues that seem to make the movie progress and this until the final revelation that turns out to be unexpected and amazing. Besides given the conclusion Ozon's movie can be considered in its whole as a farce with absurd humor. The best example involves Danile Darrieux.

	onyx:emotionText "A movie launched in 2002 8 femmes was the establishing movie for Franois Ozon. Through his movies from his mediumlength film See the Sea 1997 to 8 women 2002 to the criminal lovers 1999 he developed his own style based on surprise. In short his aim is to surprise the spectator. With this movie we can say that he reached his goal and it is probably his most accomplished movie. It is also a movie that confirms the originality of his cinema.First of all 8 women is a movie that surprises by its tone breaks. It means that Ozon passes from drama to comedy with great ease just like Jaco Van Dormael with Toto the Hero 1991. As for the songs they are totally unexpected. Which other director would have included musical numbers in a detective movie?As for the influences of the movie they are numerous. Of course this film is an adaptation from a play that evokes the Agatha Christie universe but Ozon felt like scattering his movie with all kinds of allusions Vincente Minelli Douglas Sirk the deer in the garden. These allusions are especially linked to French culture the French TV program au thtre ce soir but also Jacques Demy the bright colors the songs and French cinema before the new wave. More than allusions they are tributes from a director who once said I don't care about newwave.Franois Ozon also plays with the spectator a bit like Herg with the Tintin album the Castafiore Emerald. He holds him spellbound until the end of the film either by leading him on wrong tracks either by giving him clues that seem to make the movie progress and this until the final revelation that turns out to be unexpected and amazing. Besides given the conclusion Ozon's movie can be considered in its whole as a farce with absurd humor. The best example involves Danile Darrieux. At the beginning of the movie she seems to be disabled but then she stands up and walks without any difficulty for an important part of the movie!The movie is also powerful thanks to its dialogs. On this point beware of the poster where these 8 women have a smiling countenance! These witty and sometimes ironical dialogs reveal these women's real personality that mainly rests on selfishness.

	schema:reviewBody "8 Femmes is a playful mysterymusicaldark comedy that hearkens back to Jacques Demy's Parapluies de Cherbourg which also starred Catherine Deneuve and Demoiselles de Rochefort in which Danielle Darrieux and Deneuve played mother and daughter. The story stars off as a classic tale of murder in a closed room of an isolated mansion and all of the eight women become suspects. As the various clues and revealed secrets begin to pile up and become more and more absurd however it becomes clear that the mystery is secondary to exploring the various kinds of relationships that exist between these women and the way they have all been affected by their relationships or lack of relationships with men especially the man who has been killed.The mystery is also secondary to having a good time which everyone seems to be doing. One of the main strengths of the movie is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. The director and all of the actresses seem to be enjoying themselves so much that a sense of fun radiates throughout the film. Ozon uses laughter and black humor however to investigates the pain rivalry and joy that arise between mothers and daughters pairs of sisters sistersinlaw women servants and their mistresses and women in love with other women. It's a grand buffet of fine acting and difficult to pick out the best of the bunch  all eight women are wonderful  but Isabelle Huppert steals a number of scenes hard to do in that company with the most over the top and unexpected performance. Each woman has great moments however sometimes of tenderness sometimes of hilarious bitchiness and once in a while of sudden and intense emotional revelation. The songs that each one sings give a bit of insight to their characters and add to the overall fun of the film but they also present dramatic challenges to the actresses and all of them do well in making these musical numbers work. It's great to see Darrieux again and she does an excellent job as the matriarch of the clan who seems to be a frail and loving old grandmother at first but then pulls one surprise after another. The funniest bit in the film a wicked moment of black comedy involves an argument between her and daughter Gaby Deneuve that ends in shocking and unladylike violence. The song chosen for Darrieux to sing at the end a haunting and poignant piece written by French poet Louis Aragon and the great singersongwriter Geogre Brassens pulls the film together emotionally in an unexpected way.People expecting a straight mystery film may be disappointed in and confused by the film and the American distributors haven't helped matters any by failing to mention on the back of the video box that 8 Femmes is a musical and a dark comedy as well. But for those viewers who have an open mind and are in the mood for a playful mystery with several great actresses they should be greatly rewarded.".

	schema:reviewBody "Much like the lightweight tone that Alfred Hitchcock took with filming NORTH BY NORTHWEST after his very heavyhanded VERTIGO Francois Ozon a completely different filmmaker who shot to international acclaim in 2000 with his introspective drama SOUS LE SABLE decided to do a 180degree turn and tackle a musical in the 1950's vein. 8 FEMMES begins with a montage of flowers seen up close and some very Mancinilike music in the opening credits announcing each and every one of the eight female leads and recreates inch by inch a visual splendour that Douglas Sirk would have cheered. Fake snow fake backdrops a picturesque mansion and the most harmless little deer this side of Bambi bring forth this atmosphere of shallow artifice and this is only the beginning.Immediately he moves into the house and introduces the players women who are a part of a household who dominate the scene with their very presence. Each one of them dressed in bold distinctive colors with diametrically opposed tempers to match all gathering for a night of intrigue and catfights over the state of affairs of the man whom they are all related to  Marcel  who has apparently been killed by a knife in the back. As the day progresses it becomes increasingly clear that all of them including frail old Mamy who it seems is not an invalid and can walk quite well and Pierrette Marcel's sister who lives nearby and enters the film in with a truck load of secrets beneath her cool facade has a motive to have killed Marcel.Agatha Christie's spirit channeled in a musical? You bet. And what a rollicking ride 8 FEMMES is! Garish and melodramatic a product from the land of Technicolor and boasting wacky performances that only get more complicated as things progress and layers of lies are peeled away. The cast is something concocted out of a fantasy of casting there's Catherine Deneuve who plays Gaby a catty snob wife to Marcel and gets to utter a completely outrageous line to Isabelle Huppert who plays her sister Augustine I am rich and beautiful while you are ugly and poor. Danielle Darrieux a grand dame of movies since the Forties is a hoot as Mamy and there is a hysterical scene where after a confession to Huppert's character goes horribly crazy Deneuve whacks her on the head with a glass carafe or bottle?. Virginie Ledoyen and Ludivine Sagnier play daughters to Deneuve who may not have the same father Emmanuelle Beart is Louise the quintessential exaggeration of a French maid complete with a kissable pout Firmine Richard plays the house maid who has her own secrets and is a dead ringer to Louise Beavers in essence. Then there's the outstanding Fanny Ardant a more smoldering sensual incarnation of Katharine Hepburn and looking just like Hepburn circa 1949 when she made ADAM'S RIB who enters the movie at the right time to get things really complicated and who later on has one of the best moments on film a catfight with none other than Deneuve herself.8 FEMMES is an excessive movie made for film buffs who know about excess in the form of color campy performances and who love watching female icons getting bitchy with each other. All of the performances have their moments of high and low but Huppert not only takes the cake  she grabs it runs for the nearest exit and gobbles it whole in one gluttonous gulp and she acts like she knows it. Deneuve is quite acidic in her role  it's been light years since she's been just the pretty ingnue from the days of THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG. Older with sharper features and yet still regal and cool with a what the hell attitude. But above all of them there is Ozon someone I was not aware of until recently and whose films I'm enjoying the more I see them bringing this time capsule as if he himself were impersonating Vincent Minnelli or Robert Wise himself. A perfect oohlala of a movie.".

You bet. And what a rollicking ride 8 FEMMES is! Garish and melodramatic a product from the land of Technicolor and boasting wacky performances that only get more complicated as things progress and layers of lies are peeled away. The cast is something concocted out of a fantasy of casting there's Catherine Deneuve who plays Gaby a catty snob wife to Marcel and gets to utter a completely outrageous line to Isabelle Huppert who plays her sister Augustine I am rich and beautiful while you are ugly and poor. Danielle Darrieux a grand dame of movies since the Forties is a hoot as Mamy and there is a hysterical scene where after a confession to Huppert's character goes horribly crazy Deneuve whacks her on the head with a glass carafe or bottle?. Virginie Ledoyen and Ludivine Sagnier play daughters to Deneuve who may not have the same father Emmanuelle Beart is Louise the quintessential exaggeration of a French maid complete with a kissable pout Firmine Richard plays the house maid who has her own secrets and is a dead ringer to Louise Beavers in essence. Then there's the outstanding Fanny Ardant a more smoldering sensual incarnation of Katharine Hepburn and looking just like Hepburn circa 1949 when she made ADAM'S RIB who enters the movie at the right time to get things really complicated and who later on has one of the best moments on film a catfight with none other than Deneuve herself.8 FEMMES is an excessive movie made for film buffs who know about excess in the form of color campy performances and who love watching female icons getting bitchy with each other. All of the performances have their moments of high and low but Huppert not only takes the cake  she grabs it runs for the nearest exit and gobbles it whole in one gluttonous gulp and she acts like she knows it. Deneuve is quite acidic in her role  it's been light years since she's been just the pretty ingnue from the days of THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG. Older with sharper features and yet still regal and cool with a what the hell attitude. But above all of them there is Ozon someone I was not aware of until recently and whose films I'm enjoying the more I see them bringing this time capsule as if he himself were impersonating Vincent Minnelli or Robert Wise himself. A perfect oohlala of a movie.";

Her husband Marcel is poorly but he has allowed Gaby's mother Mamy and Aunt Augustine to remain in the house as well  with maids Chanel and Louise to help with the guests and his other daughter Catherine. With all these women in the house minor squabbles break out but nothing compares to the tension when Louise discovers that someone has murdered Marcel. With the house cut off by snow and the phone lines cut it is clear that one of the eight assembled women must have done the murder  but with so many motives and so much suspicion who could it have been? Even if you have not seen any of these types of films or plays the setup will be familiar as a sort of drawingroom one of us is the murderer affair and indeed that is exactly what it is in the tradition of Agatha Christie I suppose. However what Ozon's film does is take the staples of this genre and plays with them to produce a richly comic colourful and enjoyable exaggeration thereof. Unlike some reviewers I did not find it roaringly funny but did find it continually amusing. The plot could have been played straight and thus is good enough to hold the interest as a genre piece but it is the delivery that makes it enjoyable and engaging. While some of the songs are a bit ropey their delivery is all slightly ott and fun for it. It also helps that the whole film is full of rich colours again giving it the feel of a play happening right in front of you.Of course as with any play a lot does rest on the cast and here we are not disappointed as the starry cast mostly get what the film is trying to do. Deneuve is great as the wife while Darrieux enjoys her character a great deal. Bart and Ardant both stick in the mind easily because they have a great lingering sexuality to their characters that they bring out well Bart is particularly impressive at this game and it was here that I twigged how stunning she is. Huppert is enjoyable but I didn't like the changes her character undergoes at the end. Ledoyen is very good with her character but I wasn't so taken with Sagnier  she was OK but I thought she had the least to work with.Overall then an enjoyable and lively take on an occasionally dry genre. The plot is solid enough to be interesting but it is the delivery across the board that adds colour vitality and fun to the mix  from direction through set design to of course the performances. Not hilarious but consistently amusing and entertaining.".

Danielle Darrieux was 85 when she made this film She is now 98 and did a film in 2010. Some French people live a very long time  I think it's the wine.Deneuve 59 here is stunning very elegant and regal. Fanny Ardant as Pierette is gorgeous and sexy displaying dry wit and disdain for convention. Emmanuelle Beart is the insubordinate sexually adventurous according to her maid who transforms herself during the film as does Augustin Isabelle Huppert the homely sisterinlaw. Firmine Richard a formidable black actress does an impressive job with the role of Chanel the housekeeper who finally reveals her secret.They are all so wonderful  French women to my mind have a very earthy worldly quality as well as sophistication. When one thinks of some American actresses in comparison they seem like plain vanilla. It's a generalization I know and we do have some fine actresses but I think the mindset of American show business is focused on youth and typecasting.This film is enjoyable because of the cast and the look of the movie. I can't say the music was fabulous or even fit this story. It was a touch of whimsy and the upbeat tunes were fun. There were some sad ones too. C'est la vie.".

But it's not really any of these. It is a quite uncategorizable French film that's in parts murder mystery in parts musical. In any case it's a searing enjoyable character piece exploring 8 fascinating female figures.Presumed to be set in 1950s France eight women assemble at their countryside home ready to spend Christmas together. But the celebrations are put on hold when Marcel the only man in the house is found stabbed to death in his bed. Since it's snowed in it's clear that one of the eight women committed the murder. Fueled by this fear the eight women begin to interrogate each other and as they do the real meat of the story unfolds. Suffice it to say nothing is what it seems.8 Women takes a setup that Agatha Christie made famous in books like And Then There Were None and plays with it in a very tongueincheek way. At the same time it still astonishingly manages to be very moving. It takes itself just seriously enough as evidenced by the movie's most famous trait the song and dance numbers. Each woman gets a little song sequence to herself in which she gets to revel in her character. It should be noted that all of these are already wellknown French songs such as Pile o face sung by the minxish Emmanuelle Bart in her iconic maid's outfit and Toi jamais by Catherine Deneuve. The brilliance of these scenes is that unlike in most musicals the characters are very much aware that a song and dance is going on. When the movie's first song kicks in the mother enthusiastically starts dancing along to the grandmother's consternation and afterwards can be heard humming the chorus to herself. It's a cheeky breaking of the 4th wall that has not its like in any other movie. These music scenes give a great charm to the movie so much so that there was even a soundtrack album released.The murder mystery is the movie's setup but far more important are the women themselves as evidenced by the title. 8 Femmes is as much a story about the female psyche as it is a crime drama and each of the eight women is a fascinating character in her own right. Of particular note though is the highstrung hypochondriac spinster Augustine performed by an electrifying Isabelle Huppert. Fanny Ardant is then spellbinding as the victim's estranged sister Pierette a femmefatale who seems quite above the drama most of the other women are up to their necks in but delights in taking part in it. Catherine Deneuve is also strong as the matriarch Gaby who struggles to keep her wellordered world from falling apart as more and more secrets are revealed. Adultery lesbianism incest the plot only thickens every time someone opens her mouth.If all the above seems like a very farfetched blend that probably stands to reason. But everyone involved is determined to tell this ridiculous story with love and passion. The cast is all big French names young and old which is something Hollywood could definitely learn from from the young and vivacious Ludivine Sagnier as the victim's bratty teenage daughter Catherine to grande dame Danielle Darrieux in the role of the spiteful grandma. This movie is one of the reasons why there are awards for ensemble casts and indeed the film garnered the Silver Berlin Bear and the European Film Award for this very reason. These actresses and their characters are the heart of the film. The delivery is sharp and biting across the board and thus the film is genuinely laughoutloud funny on many occasions.8 Femmes is at the end of the day a riveting mishmash of film genres told both with love intrigue and tongue firmly planted in cheek. It's a fascinating slightly selfconscious tribute to both film genres and actresses as much as it is an entertaining crime story. Parts of it will ask you to suspend your disbelief but even so the film reels back in even its biggest doubters with a superb plot twist towards the end. Still what's important here is to what the movie's title so aptly pertains the eight women. Let them take you on a ride you are unlikely to ever forget.".

After all the premise is hardly original and every single plot twist is predictable and derivative.  There are plenty of Agatha Christie movies not to mention the wonderful play The Mousetrap to offer us what 8 Women promises as a mystery. Although I can't say if a murder mystery musical of this type has been attempted on film before the musical numbers in this film are a bit awkward and stick out like a sore thumb.  With all of this 8 Women would seem almost repellent.  Truth be told I loved every minute of it. The setting is Christmas in the mid1950s and seven women are gathering in the country home of Marcel Dominique Lamure.  There is his wife Gaby Catherine Deneuve who has just brought one of her two daughters Suzon Virginie Ledoyen back from college for the holiday.  Anxiously awaiting her are her peppy sister Catherine Ludivine Sagnier her disabled grandmother Mamy Danielle Darrieux her neurotic aunt Augustine Isabelle Huppert cook Madame Chanel Firmine Richard and newly hired maid Louise Emmanuelle Beart.  All of them although not always on the best terms with each other seem intent on having a good time this Christmas.Too bad for them.  As is customary to happen in movies with a large mansion housing many guests Marcel the only man in the house is murdered.  The phone line has been cut the car has been sabotaged and the weather is such that no one can scale the wall surrounding the grounds.  One person however does get in Marcel's sister Pierrette Fanny Ardant who arrives with a story which may or may not be true that she got a call the night before saying that Marcel had been murdered.  It becomes apparent that the murderer is one of these 8 women and it is up to them to tell the complete truth and find out everyone's secrets so that they can find out who the murderer is.It's high time we have a film like 8 Women a maliciously absurd exercise in high camp.  It succeeds even... no especially when it fails.  The story itself is the kind of murder mystery that has been filmed over and over again in previous years but it's impossible to get enough of.  This film handles all of the conventions with the perfect Christieesque tone.  It's still as fun as ever to point fingers at various possible suspect and 8 Women is just predictable enough that even the least experienced viewer can partake in the fun.And with this cast why shouldn't we have fun?  One of the main purposes of this film is to let these eight actresses simply enjoy themselves and their wicked glee comes through on screen.  I wonder if Francois Ozon was at all able to keep his authority as director during shooting.  For let such fantastic actresses loose on each other allowing all of them to inhabit such bitchy individuals one had better stay out of their way.  It is said that the best comedy relies on surprise.  Be assured 8 Women wreaks such delectable havoc on it's premise that there will be plenty of opportunities to ask Did I really just see that?This film knows a secret that we haven't seen many lowkey projects like this successfully handle in recent memory when in doubt just sing.  The musical numbers have varied success throughout the film.  All pop up sporadically and never really find a way to come to a conclusion but each one is a highly enjoyable bonus aside to everything else that's going on.In 8 Women the first rule is there are no rules.  It's infinitely meaner and much more enjoyable than its nonmusical predecessor Gosford Park. It's hilarious in its maniacal irreverence and it is yet another example of a film that would fall flat on its face if it were not for the actors leading the way.  If I am going to be seeing a murdermysterymusical I would want none other than the cast of 8 Women at the helm.".

	schema:headline " 8 Electrifying Women Suspect Each Other In A Murder Mystery  A Surprise Trick Or Treat";
	schema:reviewBody "'8 Women' is one of those rare films the kind of which one doesn't come across too often. The story sort of follows an Agatha Christie style in the 50s. Director Ozon does an incredible job of telling the story in a satirical way by taking advantage of stereotypes and making it into a musical.The murder suspects include suspect's wife Catherine Deneuve her sister Isabelle Huppert his mother Danielle Darrieux his sister Fanny Ardant his two daughters Virginie Ledoyen and Ludivin Sagnier his cook Firmine Richard and his chambermaid Emanuelle Beart. Each character is something that sets her apart either a lesbian or pregnant or a con or a seductress or unfaithful and so on. The cast includes some of the biggest names in French cinema and all 8 women deliver electrifying performances full of humour.The film goes pleasantly overthe top with the AgathaChristie and the 50's formula. The colourful art direction is delightful. The dialogues are superbly creative and the spacious cinematography especially the long shots and closeups are skillfully done. The songs are rightfully set in the scene and splendid to watch. Ozon also makes some interesting references to cinema of the 50s mostly through the characters' gestures costumes and makeup.One does not have to be a fan of musicals or French cinema to appreciate the beauty of this film. With excellent writing a lovely cast of beautiful actresses and lots of colour it is hugely entertaining with loads of fun and something that I would like to revisit.".

Isabelle Huppert was so great she almost made me forget about her performance in The Piano Teacher ick! Ludivigne Sagnier was 10x better than in Water Drops on Burning Rocks. And Catherine Deneuve is 10x better than what you'd expect she'd be at her age having seen The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.The music is incongruous and only a few songs are memorable but I got the feeling it was supposed to be that way. If they had been more serious or better music they would have detracted from the comedy.See this movie! You won't regret it.".

Obvious answer  NO ! ... Wouldn't like to see a man come singing among those ladies.The cast is just perfect and the generational mix calls for much applause easily fitting into the emotional transition with each suspect revealing her untold secret involvement and contribution to the crime Isabelle Huppert beautifully justifies her eventual best female performance at the 2003 Csars as the victim's sisterinlaw and is practically acquitted as a 'bad girl' image is voluntarily attributed to her.The complicity between head servant Madame Chanel Firmine Richard and Pierette the victim's sister beautifully played by Fanny Ardant brings many questions though it is known that classic beneficiaries of a rich man's murder are his wife and children payed by wellknown French star Catherine Deneuve a and sisters Suzon Virginie Ledoyen and Cathrine Ludivine Saigner.Although Mamy Danielle Darrieux the victim's motherinlaw and Louise Emmanuelle Bart the maid have their own secrets they seem to have little to fear except a possible collective crime.Whatever you like or hate about those crimes committed and solved at home without external help director Franois Ozon's movie will satisfy anyone who appreciates good costume designing adapted to a certain poque which saw those passionate crimes.I still think our victim died for his crimes anyway though what a pity for that 8th woman who remains innocent and uninvolved afterall except if....... she should think out her initiatives with more psychology.".

The secrets in such a family can be very surprising even to the members of the family and I enjoyed it very much to see how the secrets are unveiled.The singings are good and bad some so nice Augustine's and Chanel's for example but some are kind of unnatural like Suzon's.  They indeed serve the purpose of knowing the characters well.  This plus the dialogues separates this film from most Hollywood blockbusters the characters have life while most popular Hollywood movies have very shallow and stereotypical characters.So if you like actions suspense special effects you probably will be disappointed on this movie.

Specifically this means a ludicrous plot characters who act for paper thin or indiscernible motivations an absence of believable dialogue or emotions and a continual round of unprovoked revelations that serve to make everyone a suspect. Ozon doesn't play this dead straight at times he has fun with the absurdities of the genre but not really enough fun to make up for the fundamental ridiculousness of the whole construction and in merging the mystery with another genre the musical he creates a more distinctive film although it has to be said that the musical elements never really feel wholly integrated into the rest of the movie.

In my opinion this is an unfair rating... the film is better than it has been portrayed.Jeff Bridges plays Matt Scudder a down on his luck detective who is suspended by the LAPD after a violent confrontation with a suspect.Bridges life spirals down in something of a preview of the character he would later play in perhaps his best film 1991's The Fisher King into chronic alcoholism.  He receives an unexpected invitation to a party hosted by Angel Maldonado Andy Garcia in an early role and there the story proper begins.Scudder is drawn into the dark side of LA's party scene by Sunny one of Maldonado's erstwhile hangers on.  Through this connection Scudder determines to bring down Maldonado's drug empire  and make off with Maldonado's favourite girl...All standard hollywood stuff but reasonably well done.  The mid 80's seems to have been a fairly soft time for truly good films but this one is worth watching.   I give it 710 on the public scale...".

Andy Garcia is a great villain. Psychotic warm and pathetic.  He makes poison sweet like a Jalapeno pepper.  This is entertaining film noir.  All of the characters are flawed. They all have weaknesses or addictions that are their downfall.  Bridges's Scudder is an alcoholic.  Rosanna Arquette is addicted to money.  Which always makes a good film noir.  2 things that I usually see in the TV version of 8 Million Ways to Die 1986 that are cut out is 1 Alexandra Paul's Sunny has a bathroom scene with Scudder which is usually cut out.  It's as naked a scene as Isabella Rosellini's scene in Blue Velvet.  2 There is a long drawn out downspell of Bridges's character in the beginning that they. The studios usually cut out.  I don't buy the ending with Bridges and Arquette's character going off together but Arquette does say that her dad was an alcoholic and we usually go for our parent's hardest traits in our mates so. Maybe. They do get together.  Overall This is underrated and overlooked. This is a Mr. cinema 100 pick.".

This is The movie to see when you are down and shows you how a man who has been at the bottom can gather himself and bring on his best.May be what i write seems to be intellectual stuff but actually the film is a great police movie with a perfect direction and the message simply comes out of its own after watching it.the cast is brilliant this movie made me a Jeff Bridges fan he is the best 4 times award nominee. Alexandra Paul Andy Garcia and Randy Brooks are excellent. Rosanna Arquette is a bit weaker than the others. she can't really compete with Paul and the male cast. She is a good actress but I am not sure she fits the hookerjunkie type.What more can I say  my favorite movie ever.Ho! yes an unforgettable soundtrack by James NewtonHoward. one of his earlier works may be its best !!. The soundtrack together with the opening scene showing the police car from the air is a masterpiece.".

	schema:headline " Decent thriller in which an excop with drinking problem becomes involved dark issues and attempts to save a prostitute";
	schema:reviewBody "Violent and exciting movie about narcotics dealers  hotshot prostitutes and an expoliceman . Scudder Jeff Bridges is a cop from the County Department who is forced to abandon his duty  after shooting a violent suspect during a drug raid . The ensuing psychological aftermath of this busting worsens his alcoholic troubles . During his recovery through Alcoholics Anonymous  he meets a suspicious stranger Randy Brooks who draws him back into a world of vice and prostitution . Later on  he attempts to rescue a pimpbound hooker Alexandra Paul from a drug lord called Angel Maldonado Andy Garcia . Scudder learns his friend has dark business with Angel . Scudder must enter a crimeworld of prostitution and drugs to solve a killing  and get kneedeep in a mess of million dollar drug deals . Meanwhile  the excop falls in love for another gorgeous prostitute Rosanna Arquette.In the picture there is tension  romance  thriller  emotion  intrigue  murders  drugtrafficking and a little bit of violence . A love story between a drunk excop and whore is loosely interwoven with drug dealers and many other things . The movie is fastmoving on the ending but usually results to be slowmoving and being enough amusing as well as compelling but happen many events . The pic obtained moderated success and didn't attain the box office that the producers wanted . The suspense movie is correctly narrated but there're some storyline gaps and the twisted plot makes it a few ridiculous . Famous screenwriter Oliver Stone had little to do with his original script which subsequently was rewritten by Robert Towne and then revised by Hal Ashby in improvisation  he said he only visited the set once and wanted to have his name taken off the picture but it was too late as the credits were already made up for it . The film is rated R for violence  nudism and some sex . The outcome of this drug and corruption story may not end happily or neatly just like in real life  but the characters and ideas explored along the way are compelling . Director takes on a complex subject with a large  uniformly excellent cast . Filmmaker Hal Ashby threw away the script and had the actors improvise all their dialog and actions . As nice acting from Jeff Bridges as an excop who hires himself out to rescue a prostitute while resisting the temptation to return to his alcohol abuse . Andy Garcia's fine interpretation as a drug dealer  he is good but plays as Latin stereotypes . And two bombshell women  Rosanna Arquette and Alexandra Paul . Furthermore  Tommy 'Tiny' Lister as Nose Guard and James Avery as Deputy  but both of whom hand roles very secondaries . Catching original musical score composed and performed by James Newton Howard but with excessive use of synthesizer . Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Stephen Burum  being totally shot in Los Angeles  California . The motion picture was professionally directed by Hal Ashby  though with no originality . It turned out to be his last theatrical film . However  being fired just after principal photography wrapped and the studio  PSO Entertainment took over creative control . Ashby was firstly film editor  in fact his highlight of his film editing career was winning an Oscar for the landmark In the heat of the night 1967 . As its director Jewison gave him a script he was too busy to work on called The landlord1970 . It became Ashby's first film as a director . From there he delivered a series of wellacted  intelligent human scaled flicks that included dramas as  The last detail 1973 Bound of glory 76  The slugger's wife 85  Coming home 78  comedies  Harold and Maud 71 Shampoo 1975  Lookin' to get out82 and his biggest hit  Being there 79 with Peter Sellers .

	schema:reviewBody "Not convincingly performed with a hell of a dramatic climax in that warehouse which is the bit that this movie is mainly remembered for. Yes I saw it decades ago and tonight on DVD. And what was good back then now just seem ludicrous. But I'm RavenGlamDVDCollectorgmail.com and not here to discuss the action parts.Alexandra Paul must have been desperate for an acting job. Gee she plays somebody whom lieutenant Stephanie Holden of BAYWATCH fame would have loved to set straight. Hey fullfrontal nudity as 'the streetlights makes her pubic hair glow'... She does seem utterly utterly miscast... This might be because of this hindsight.But the main reason to watch glamorwise is cue the Toto song here Ali I wanna do when I wake up in the morning is see your eyes Rosanna Rosanna Lady Rosanna Arquette. And although the script literally has yucky moments once she is thrown into the shower and the unnecessary makeup is washed off wow dudes! What a stunner!I've cheered for this actress during the Eighties. She wasn't in successful big hit movies real success eluded her and I saw all that potential going to waste.

If you saw this movie when it was on the cinema circuit and you're waffling on about it almost 30 years later of course you have to be an Old Boy. And Old Boys appreciate pretty girls. And get kinda silly drooling. Sigh.If you're not into seeing these two actresses and just want action action action this might not really be the movie for you. Lots of the action scenes are seriously flawed. Hell he's out of work ruins his car yet it just stays roadworthy in the next scenes. And why don't the baddies just shoot him down in that standoff scene?Five stars go to Rosanna Arquette the other star is for that glorious Clint Eastwoody moment when Scudder fires his gun after coming to Sarah's rescue. Cinematic perfection!".

Yes I saw it decades ago and tonight on DVD. And what was good back then now just seem ludicrous. But I'm RavenGlamDVDCollectorgmail.com and not here to discuss the action parts.Alexandra Paul must have been desperate for an acting job. Gee she plays somebody whom lieutenant Stephanie Holden of BAYWATCH fame would have loved to set straight. Hey fullfrontal nudity as 'the streetlights makes her pubic hair glow'... She does seem utterly utterly miscast... This might be because of this hindsight.But the main reason to watch glamorwise is cue the Toto song here Ali I wanna do when I wake up in the morning is see your eyes Rosanna Rosanna Lady Rosanna Arquette. And although the script literally has yucky moments once she is thrown into the shower and the unnecessary makeup is washed off wow dudes! What a stunner!I've cheered for this actress during the Eighties. She wasn't in successful big hit movies real success eluded her and I saw all that potential going to waste.

After all we've still got the great Jeff Bridges and Andy Garcia. Unfortunately even they can't redeem this dog's dinner.

It's a conventional film but one must remember that at this stage in his career Ashby had little or no creative control. He was a recovering alcoholic and drug user and the studio's lack of faith in him resulted in 8 Million Ways to Die being taken taken away during post production.Of course when the producers took this film away the moment it reached the cutting room they effectively shot themselves in the foot. Ashby who cut his teeth as a film editor is renowned for his perfectionism in the editing room. He's a master editor. And so no surprise that 8 Million received a limited release and faded from theatres days later.Still though conventional 8 Million is nevertheless a fine film. A cosy neonoir it also features a somewhat autobiographical subplot regarding alcohol abuse. Here Jeff Bridges plays your typical noir detective but like Ashby his character is a recovering alcoholic. As a result there's an honesty to a couple of Bridges' dialogue scenes. One conversation for example has Jeff talking to a hooker. He talks about his love for his daughter whom he hasn't seen in years and his hatred of being a drunk. The hooker replies that she never knew her father because he was a drunkard who never came home. Ashby shoots the scene to imply that Jeff is looking into his future our hero a wounded old man looking at both his own daughter and the very outcome of his present alcoholism.There are two or three good scenes like this but for the most part the film's script has been edited down to your standard cops and bad guys movie. One senses that had Ashby been at the editing desk a more freeform movie would have resulted.Still the film begins and ends with two very unique scenes. It's introduction for example features a long helicopter shot which tracks across an American superhighway Ashby's camera framing distant automobiles like elevator carts watching as they rise bizarrely off into the sky. The film ends meanwhile with an unusual threeway Mexican stand off. Ashby draws this scene out to painful lengths everyone yelling and screaming until their demands reach pathetic proportions. We've seen this scene before in countless other action movies but none of these flicks have done anything quite like this.7.910  Moments of Ashby's personality and sensibilities shine through but for the most part this film has been hacked down by the studios into something slight. For Ashby completists only.".

Scudder's initial descent into alcoholism is almost skipped over you suspect that Stone or Ashby given half the chance would have added some detail to the descent. Instead of which Scudder's wife suddenly disappears he's on his own. Perhaps you can explain this by saying 'blackout' but I think it's an error. The movie is realistically slow treating the characters as real people which is perhaps a mistake for the genre. There isn't much action until the very end and the couple of bits during the film are followed by Scudder blacking out so we don't get him dealing with the aftermath of these violent events. This is one of the few BlockScudder novels i haven't read so I can't comment on how similar to the book it is. My guess would be very since Block tends to go in for very violent climaxes preceded by Scudder wondering if he'll hit the bottle again.

It never seems to get anywhere and you have a hard time believing that the slick drug dealer is up to no good or that the lush private eye wants to do anything to stop him.This is the story of an alcoholic cop Jeff Bridges who got kicked off the force after a sting operation went wrong and he shot an unarmed assailant. Although one might not think it too bad though that he did shoot the guy since he was nearly stabbing his partner to death and it was the only way the cop could stop him in time. Now a sort of freelance private investigator his help is sought by a friendly prostitute who seeks his protection because she wants to quit the business. And she is willing to pay him a hefty sum. It hardly seems like good enough reason for her to later wind up dead which is what happens since her pimp really doesn't seem to mind that she's made this decision. In fact he feels a little hurt that she didn't tell him herself.Well having just lost a friend although we might seem to think the private investigator only new her very briefly he is sure that someone was pursuing her and he wants to figure out who and why. This guy hardly seems stable enough to keep going on with the police work since every time something traumatic happens he falls into a drunken depressed stupor. Eventually he hooks up with the hooker's friend Rossanna Arquette a sort of doppleganger in that she is both naughty and nice but shakes off the naughty after she gets to know the guy who doesn't seem at all bothered to help him out even though she thinks he is responsible for the woman's death at first. He also employs the help of the woman's pimp a pretty decent guy for a fellow who runs a prostitution business and he's willing to help out because he knows the drug dealer Andy Garcia that the investigator suspects is responsible for the girl's death is really a vicious fellow even though he never really shows it.There is not really enough solid character development everyone appears a little too off to be those kind of characters and the movie tends to drag on at points especially in feeling obligated to develop some sort of relationship between the cop and the hooker's friend but if you're willing to forgive that much then you might at least have a little lazy day entertainment with a semidecent action movie. Open a can of 80s cheese and enjoy.".

In fact he feels a little hurt that she didn't tell him herself.Well having just lost a friend although we might seem to think the private investigator only new her very briefly he is sure that someone was pursuing her and he wants to figure out who and why. This guy hardly seems stable enough to keep going on with the police work since every time something traumatic happens he falls into a drunken depressed stupor. Eventually he hooks up with the hooker's friend Rossanna Arquette a sort of doppleganger in that she is both naughty and nice but shakes off the naughty after she gets to know the guy who doesn't seem at all bothered to help him out even though she thinks he is responsible for the woman's death at first. He also employs the help of the woman's pimp a pretty decent guy for a fellow who runs a prostitution business and he's willing to help out because he knows the drug dealer Andy Garcia that the investigator suspects is responsible for the girl's death is really a vicious fellow even though he never really shows it.There is not really enough solid character development everyone appears a little too off to be those kind of characters and the movie tends to drag on at points especially in feeling obligated to develop some sort of relationship between the cop and the hooker's friend but if you're willing to forgive that much then you might at least have a little lazy day entertainment with a semidecent action movie. Open a can of 80s cheese and enjoy.";

A Hispanic druglord Angel MoldonadoAndy Garcia is the one who had Sunny murderedshe knew too much because she's a major reason Angel was able to move his productand Scudder wants to bring his empire down. Angel was using a pimp named ChanceRandy Brooksto traffic by using his box boys hiding the coke in logs. Chance trying to go straightwell not dope dealing as he once did in the past running legitimate supermarketsand allowing girls to pimp at his mansion is plenty upset to find out through Scudder's detective work that Angel was using his places of business to move coke. This sets off a war between Scudder and Angel with Chance wanting a piece of the action after it is truly acknowledged that Sunny was killed by Moldonado. A bargaining chip in all this is a high priced hooker named SarahRosanna Arquettewho Angel is obsessive over and Scudder falls in love with. Scudder confiscates with Chance's help the logs of cocaine and is willing to trade the product for Sarah..sufficed to say this exchange doesn't go according to plan as Scudder involves the police and Chance wishes to get revenge for Angel's actions.Well 8 MILLION WAYS TO DIE is a redemption story in that it follows a struggling boozing detective who has lost his marriage and recked his career by drinking on the job including shooting a Hispanic drug dealerwho pulled a Louisville Slugger baseball bat to attack cops under Scudder's commandin front of his family when an arrest goes awry. What's interesting is how Scudder is rather inadvertently pulled into his dilemma through the pleas of a hooker wanting to get out of the life and away from a dangerous criminal using her to help him traffic his cocaine. Arquette is the hooker who is around the LA crowd due to her working at Chance's palace and this is where she was introduced to Angel. It's only when Scudder discovers lots of green and other valuables left by Sunny in his trunk that he goes to Sarah for answers regarding a fellow call girl and who might want her dead.Garcia's oily temperamental gangsterhe at first seems to want a piece of a club which Chance runshas several heated exchanges with the seemingly fearless Scudder where both men size each other up this lit fuse eventually exploding at the end as Scudder and Angel finally square off with Sarah their desired prize. With unsavory characters and foul languagenot to mention we spend an entire film with these people 8 MILLION WAYS TO DIE won't exactly ingratiate itself to everyone. I must admit that I enjoyed the snocone confrontation where Scudder initiates a meeting between he and Angel forward about knowing that Moldonado killed Sunny and instigating a potential partnershipin actuality Scudder wants to find a way to shake him down to no availwhere money and coke would be of major emphasis. It's one of those instances where two actors of the caliber of Bridges and Garcia have opposing characters who meet nose to nose and measure each other's dicks with Arquette's nervous Sarah looking on. They just go at each other while sucking on their snocones profane remarks passed back and forth Sunny's death a frequent topic which stirs the pot. Bridges uses his outward ability to express the effects of alcoholism while we also see that he's still a pretty damn good cop who snuffs out Angel and joins forces with an incensed Chance which doesn't exactly bode well with the policewhose reputation is tainted because of Scudder's associations with Chance a known criminal and his ongoing battle with booze. I must admit that the dialogue had me wincing at times it was rather hard to listen to. The cast does what it can with the material. I had read that the film was taken from the director and cut by the studio which might explain some of the film's problems in it's overall plot and characters. Particularly glaring is the moment in the movie where Sunny is killed Scudder looks over the bridge in despair due to his inability to save her and the movie seems to leave us in the dark over a period of two days Matt awakening to find himself in a hospital. It's said that he got drunk and blacked out but he appeared to have been beateneven hobbling on the leg with bruises throughout. This foggy portion of the film is an example of probable tampering which effects the quality of the movienot to mention an excessively long conclusion after Bridges' overlapping dialogue regarding his promising future with Scudder and Sarah walking in embrace on a beach going on and on. And I'm simply amazed that Scudder can seemingly walk around in broad daylight without a care in the world and remain safe especially with a hothead like Angel in the city having the resources to eliminate such an obvious threat.".

Sunny ends up getting murdered and Matthew tries to solve the murder.Sure the character development is scant and some of the lines in this movie are howlerslike Sunny exclaiming which part of her anatomy glows in the dark but the movie is not bad. Jeff Bridges shines as Matthew Scudder and Andy Garcia plays the scummy character of Angel Moldonado well. Rosanna Arquette is pretty good also as the smarmy and snobbish Sarah. These are the performances that keep the movie afloat.Its kind of sad that this underrated drama never got a DVD release. Its like depriving people of seeing a movie that deserves a look of seeing it while shoving crappy filmslike anything from Seltzer and Freidberg down their throats.

There is a sense of danger throughout the entire movie that never lets up.  Andy Garcia is also good in one of his earliest roles as the bad guy Angel.  The script was written by Oliver Stone before he became famous and isn't bad.  The worst part of the movie is probably the direction by Hal Ashby while a great director it just seems like he wasn't sure about what sort of movie he was making.  LA looks sleazy just like it should in this sort of movie.  The sun is bright and the sky is gray and cloudy with smog.  This is a good movie to rent but don't try and watch on regular TV because most of the dialogue will have to be cut.  It would turn into a silent movie.  Still I recommend this to any fans of film noir and detective movies.".

At this point to give some background he wasn't getting the same kind of prime work he did in the 70s Harold and Maude Last Detail Coming Home Shampoo Being There this despite the fact that he won an Oscar as editor and nominated for director. After some lowbudget comedies and a less than great Rolling Stones movie he took on this neonoir coscripted by Oliver Stone and had a good cast in place with Jeff Bridges playing the onoff lush exdetective Rosanna Arquette as the call girl entrapped by cold grinningvicious pimppusher played by newcomer Andy Garcia. It seemed like a solid genre picture one that could hopefully make a few bucks among the crowds looking for another fix of action and crime and romance and whathaveyou.As far as I know I'm not sure why Ashby was then fired midway through by the producers. Maybe it was paranoia on the producers part Ashby had an addiction to cocaine ironically considering the subject matter of the film and perhaps he was still on it during filming or he did genuinely screw up somehow but seeing that he wasn't part of the production all the way through it casts the film in something of another light. Taking it as it is there's some entertainment to be had with the tense dialog from Stone between Bridges and Garcia and also some good chemistry between Bridges and Arquette. Hell there's even a compelling undercurrent of redemption that's to be had with Bridges's Matthew coming back from bad alcoholic blackouts to track down the killer of the call girl Sonny.But and this is the crucial part the film often has the feel as though it was seriously meddled with by the producers. This isn't to say Ashby's touches with his actors isn't there as that's compelling enough but the soundtrack in place makes this so painfully scream out 1980 THRILLER! that it boggles the mind like a hangover with Miami Vice. And there's even a section of the plot that as perhaps with Matthew as well blacks out right after Sonny's death. Certain other scenes don't feel like they had that touch of what came at least mostly naturally to Ashby which was interesting editing. It would've been one thing if this was just another in a series of damned efforts from the director apparently another film he made also had this happen to him but given that it's also his final directed feature albeit after the fact adds to the shamefulness.Does 8 Million Ways to Die deserve a director's cut? Maybe so maybe not as it stands it's a competent mostly satisfying thriller. But we'll never know either way.".

The movie throws us right into the action with Bridges and his group of cops from the sheriff's department about to apprehend an hispanic drug dealer. Bridges and his pal too aren't shy about taking a tot of whatever from a cannister prior. Forced to shoot this dealer down as one of Bridge's mate is taking a whacking from one of those nasty Louisville sluggers he's questioned along with his friend. That night him and his friend get sozzled Bridges the more drunk of the two who tends to fall off bar stools. He falls into a guilt drunken phase the following scene an emotional one between him and his family over some awlfully sad music. Bridges is so believable in his role here we really acknowledge what a great actor this guy is. To think he never won an Oscar until 2010's Crazy Heart is criminal.

I love the scene where Bridges and Sarah meet Angel and his goons in the big car park outside this big museum where a lot of angry expletives are exchanged in some good meaty and funny dialogue. Let's face it this movie doesn't have the best script in the world but there are some classicly original lines that stick one involving Sunny describing her anatomy. Bridges and Garcia share this colorful conversation over sno cones Angel proudly provides. How cool and original is that. Sarah is snatched back from Bridges who was trying to get answers from her thus he must get her back as she's in dangerous waters now. This flick uses great L.A. locations and is beautifully shot Hal Ashby's last film too. The Lawrence Block novel is vastly different where it's set in New York and the pimp's name is Chance unlike the Chance character in the film Angel's silent partner I guess. You'll get this joke if you watch this film. Another scene involving a string of expletives takes place later in a warehouse as we build towards our climax. They were really in need of a script doctor that day. The climax is rewarding as is it's happy after scene. What we've got here is a good drama a little disjointed in bits as in it's dialogue but it's exciting involving and more so it's different. And those sort of movies I like. Though slow paced this really didn't bother me. It works for this movie as we get really get to scratch the surface of Bridges and Arquette's characters. For me what I loved most about this timeless flick was it's locations. This is one of those eighties bucket list classics you must see. This was another '86 movie I would of loved to seen at the cinema but we can't turn back time can we.".

Bridges and his pal too aren't shy about taking a tot of whatever from a cannister prior. Forced to shoot this dealer down as one of Bridge's mate is taking a whacking from one of those nasty Louisville sluggers he's questioned along with his friend. That night him and his friend get sozzled Bridges the more drunk of the two who tends to fall off bar stools. He falls into a guilt drunken phase the following scene an emotional one between him and his family over some awlfully sad music.

After a classic film noir set up in the first third we are immediately shown who the villain is and what he's up to. Which doesn't really leave us with much of interest for the last two thirds of the film. For example by the time Bridges reveals the Big Secret of What's Really Going On to the other characters we are not surprised at all even though the scene is played out as a pivotal point in the plot.I think that if the film had been more skillfully edited we would have had a story that was both artistic as a character study and involving as a crime story.

For those reviewers who call this film a waste of time or place it in the hall of shame maybe they should go back to watching more obvious and simple films. 8mm focuses on snuff movies and follows Nicholas Cage as he ventures into the dark underworld of the pornographic industry. I'm not a great fan of Nicholas Cage I still wonder how he ever made it as a movie star but in 8mm felt he redeemed himself from past performances. Other actors in the film put on great performances notably Joaquin Pheonix and James Gandolfini of Sopranos.What makes the film worth watching though is the emotion dark imagery and tense moments throughout the film. The storyline too is very well thought out although does have a few holes and untouched areas that may have helped develop the film further. There is no Hollywood ending forced propaganda or marketing. What you do get is graphic scenes moderate violence and an insight into snuff movies which really is quite disturbing.Having said that this movie is not for the faint hearted so if you're a puppydogs and icecream kind of person I'd suggest watching something else. If however you feel you will be able to stomach such a film then prepare yourself for a moving film which will leave you feeling that little bit darker at the end.I highly recommend this film. 810".

I can see why someone wouldn't like it but I can't see why it would have such a low rating.  I would assume that most viewers couldn't handle the subject and therefore gave the film a low rating.All of the actors involved in this film did a very good job.  Nicholas Cage was great as always sometimes a little overacting but most of the time he was great.  James Gandolfini Joaquin Phoenix Peter Storemare Anthony Heald Catherine Keener and the rest of the supporting cast all pulled off solid performances.Joel Schumacher really needs to stick with films like this.  He really does a great job with thrillerdrama type films and needs to steer clear of certain superhero films.  Joel did a great job with this film and I look forward to his next work.The only complaint I have about the film is the music.

	schema:reviewBody "When it came out 8mm became notorious for its dark and perverted subject matter. Any and all warnings that are given in association with this film are warranted this is a dark dark thriller and one that revels in a lot of sordid subject matter. How this was never threatened with an NC17 is beyond me.Tom Welles Nicholas Cage is a wellrespected private detective. One day he gets a call from a recently widowed and exceedingly wealthy woman named Mrs. Christian Myra Carter. It seems that when Mrs. Christian was going through her husbands things she came across a film reel that appears to be a snuff film a snuff film is where someone is actually murdered on screen not merely acting like it. Tom is hired to find out if the film is actually real.Andrew Kevin Walker wrote the suspense hit Seven and the two films bear a number of similarities. Both deal with grisly and bizarre subject matter and take no prisoners when they show it all. But Seven had something that 8mm doesn't a sense of atmosphere. Try as he might director Joel Schumaker can't establish an ominous atmosphere which mutes the film's impact.The acting varies. Nicholas Cage is effective as Tom Welles though that's to be expected because this is a role that Cage could play in his sleep. Joaquin Phoenix shines as Max California the porn star clerk who becomes Tom's sidekick. The rest of the cast is not so great. James Gandolfini is okay as Eddie Poole but Peter Stormare Dino Velvet a mysterious hardcore porn producer Anthony Heald as Mrs. Christian's lawyer Daniel Longdale looking strikingly similar to Geraldo Rivera and Catherine Keener Tom's neurotic wifeare awful.8mm works but it's not masterpiece. The story is easy to follow as long as you don't stop to think about how the film gets from one scene to the next. But the final 20 minutes are bad they're not credible and everyone acts like they've lost their brains.Seven contained an ingenious twist ending and while 8mm doesn't offer that it takes a few unexpected turns and the story is not formulaic.This is a good film but not a great one. Recommended if you can get it for cheap.".

How this was never threatened with an NC17 is beyond me.Tom Welles Nicholas Cage is a wellrespected private detective. One day he gets a call from a recently widowed and exceedingly wealthy woman named Mrs. Christian Myra Carter. It seems that when Mrs. Christian was going through her husbands things she came across a film reel that appears to be a snuff film a snuff film is where someone is actually murdered on screen not merely acting like it. Tom is hired to find out if the film is actually real.Andrew Kevin Walker wrote the suspense hit Seven and the two films bear a number of similarities. Both deal with grisly and bizarre subject matter and take no prisoners when they show it all. But Seven had something that 8mm doesn't a sense of atmosphere. Try as he might director Joel Schumaker can't establish an ominous atmosphere which mutes the film's impact.The acting varies. Nicholas Cage is effective as Tom Welles though that's to be expected because this is a role that Cage could play in his sleep. Joaquin Phoenix shines as Max California the porn star clerk who becomes Tom's sidekick. The rest of the cast is not so great. James Gandolfini is okay as Eddie Poole but Peter Stormare Dino Velvet a mysterious hardcore porn producer Anthony Heald as Mrs. Christian's lawyer Daniel Longdale looking strikingly similar to Geraldo Rivera and Catherine Keener Tom's neurotic wifeare awful.8mm works but it's not masterpiece. The story is easy to follow as long as you don't stop to think about how the film gets from one scene to the next. But the final 20 minutes are bad they're not credible and everyone acts like they've lost their brains.Seven contained an ingenious twist ending and while 8mm doesn't offer that it takes a few unexpected turns and the story is not formulaic.This is a good film but not a great one. Recommended if you can get it for cheap.";

	schema:reviewBody "There is a lot to be said about skill. Joel Schumacher is responsible for Batman  Robin one of the most horrendously made movies in the past 15 years. One could have said upon leaving the theater in 1997 that Joel Schumacher is one of the worst directors working today. Two years later Schumacher creates something albeit with commercial sensibilities that succeeds on many levels. 8mm is a murky scuzzy passage through the miserable dystopian criminal world of snuff films taken on by a private investigator who is dismayed and scarred by what he unearths. It probes the resources of violent exploitation films but not as a violent exploitation film. It would more accurately turn your stomach than amuse. Andrew Kevin Walker who wrote Seven and again establishes a protagonist who confronts evil and nearly loses his sanity in an effort to understand its reasons. The answer comes almost at the end of the film from its most vicious character but his rationale wittingly refrains from going as deep as the psychological world of his deeds. Joel Schumacher has an attraction to sinister perhaps Gothic environments even if his previous films that follow that pattern aren't so great like The Lost Boys. Here with Mychael Danna's sorrowful score and the great Robert Elswit's guilty peeping camera he fashions an impression of apprehension even in the few scenes where the story takes solace in Cage's home life. One director would not be wrong to shock us with a comparison to the unsuspecting atmosphere of Cage's residential street or the opening airport shot but Schumacher perceives the looming subterranean goingson beneath the unsuspecting.The intent of the story is to consider a rather everyday individual and provoke him into such a troubling conflict with pure evil that he himself is pushed to torture and murder. He lives an unexciting but mostly happy life with his wife Catherine Keener and their infant daughter. He went to a good school on an academic scholarship however while his contemporaries went through the most conventional motions to become lawyers doctors bankers he chose a line of work comprised of following shadowing investigating staking out watching. For the sake of a comfortable living he accommodates an upper crust circle of socialites and politicians. Nevertheless this case which he almost does not take is unique. He is sent for by the attorney of a rich widow whose husband has just died. Whilst rummaging through the inside of her husband's safe she and the lawyer find an 8 mm film of what seems to be the vicious slaying of a teenage girl by a large masked man. Cage convinces himself that the film while horrifying is simulation but the widow wants him to confirm this for sure.8mm doesn't consider the story's dilemmas merely as opportunity for moneymaking set pieces like action scenes. When Cage has the chance to take revenge he doesn't have the command of his motivation because he does not have the same capacity for murder that his prospective victims have and he essentially calls a character wounded by this person and provokes her to talk him into it. That is a novel approach the protagonist's vengeful turning point and it elicits subliminal moral uncertainty that the audience has to take in hand.8mm is a conventional studio thriller but it is a real movie. It is all content and the suitable approach to that content. It is about human's aptitude for malevolence conjecturing just deep it can go and how little we care to know of it in ourselves.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I watched 8 MM I didn't know what to expect but I noticed that Joel Schumacher directed it and I am a fan of his. Also it stars two other terrific actors like Nicholas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix so usually that equals a great film. 8 MM turned out to be a terrific dark drama that I'm not so sure that I understand it's low rating. I was actually expecting it to be in the 7.0 range when I went to check it out on IMDb but it's in the low 6.0's. I understand that it's an extremely dark movie that not too many people would wanna take a look at but for what it was I thought it was great. It took us into the deep dark world of porn and what some sick people get off on. It's not just about that but also it takes us into a detective type of drama that makes it into a scary type of thriller.Tom Welles is a detective that is given a strange short movie called a snuff film where a beautiful young girl is being brutally raped and then murdered on film. While it's supposed to be fake it looks incredibly real and terrifying. Her relative asks him to find out wither it is fake or real and if she's still alive. This means he has to go deep into a world of brutal porn that is out of his league. With the help of a porn salesman Max they go to find out if this girl is really alive or not but end up getting into some serious trouble when the directors and actors find out about them.8 MM is in no way for the faint of heart there are some extremely disturbing images that I really wouldn't like to see again I'm sure most wouldn't either but this is a great dark drama that I would recommend for a watch. Nicholas did a great job but Joaquin really takes the show here. He made his character incredibly believable and almost sympathetic. Joel really made me believe the story he shot it wonderfully and didn't over do anything. I would recommend this film for a watch it's a great thriller that is impressive as well as scary.810".

	schema:reviewBody "The intensely intriguing storyline of 8MM follows the haunting search by a private investigator played superbly by Nicolas Cage for the makers of a grotesque and disturbing snuff film in which a young woman is murdered. Starting by looking through endless missing persons files in an attempt to identify the victim Cage ultimately follows leads to the world of underground seaze films and the people who are involved in making them. Throughout his creepy investigation Cage becomes more and more disturbed by the Snuff film and stops at nothing in an attempt to track down answers to what really happened.  This film is So intriguing and suspenseful there are scenes that will leave your heart pounding in anticipation of what's to come.  I don't know if I have ever seen such an intriguing and suspenseful DramaThriller ever before!  This film is so realistic there are times when you feel as if what is going on is real and you begin to feel more for the characters than you usually do in a film.  The last 20 minutes of the film are heart pounding and breathtaking!  Director Joel Schumacher delivers one of the most mind haunting dramas you will ever see and gives us a story that won't be easy to forget.  It's dark moody creepy brilliant and disturbing!  And when all the pieces finally come together you'll be glad you went along for the ride.  Wow It's a sick world we live in!!  I give this movie 4 out of 4 stars!".

I said two halves because after the first viewing 8MM is about as exciting as a Maths exam. I can't even sit through this movie for a few more times for my favourite actor Phoenix. Having said that 8MM is one of my favourites. Firstly it introduced me to the great talent that Phoenix is. Secondly it made me think long and hard about the perversity in human beings. And what I thought about made me sad but nevermind. Third I truly enjoyed it when I saw it on HBO. I can't deny that. 8MM doesn't make me feel dirty it doesn't excite me that way it didn't bore me...it just made me sad. Granted Joel Schumacher doesn't seem to know where he's heading and the ending was kind of stupid. Nicolas Cage could have been better but then he could have been worse. The whole movie seems terribly messed up...but hey isn't that what the pornographic world is? Terribly messed up?possible spoilersAmy Morton was absolutely wonderful as the stressed out mother. She had me sympathising with her and among so many messed up characters she is the one I remember the most. Along with Max California who was excellently portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix who seems to have a way of changing his voice for his roles. Like many other users have said Max was the only comic relief in the movie. It was quite tragic and stupid on the script writers' part what happened to him. Phoenix played Max's last scene with such terrifying realism it was painful to watch. According to Schumacher on the DVD though Phoenix really became Max. He wasn't acting there he was truly terrified of the other actors. That guy who played Dino was also good in fact almost every cast member was good except Catherine Keener who annoyed me terribly and sadly Nicolas Cage who looked like he was sleepwalking through half of it. But then again like I've said before he could have been worse. So now do I really need to reinforce my opinion that Joaquin Phoenix is the best thing since sliced bread and he was the best thing in 8MM?8MM is definitely a dark movie but on the other hand its darkness makes it realistic. Because what  happens to Mary Anne is something I see happening right now. That is the sadness of it that and the fact that normal people like you and me like Machine are twisted enough to want to make people suffer because they can.".

There is no red light district there but if you walk along Hollywood Boulevard it is close enough to the way NYC used to look on 42nd Street before the mayor cleaned it up.James Gandolfini is especially sleazy as a smalltime porn producer Anthony Heald as a sleazy lawyer sorry to be redundant and Cage is hired by the widow of a wealthy industrialist's who wants to solve the mystery of this 8mm film. She is mystified as to why her husband would have really commissioned a snuff film although the point of knowing this after he is deceased seems a slight mystery.Cage is very good and Catherine Keener is his wife who is not given a significant role but is good enough. Peter Stormare also could have been given a meatier role his character was more interesting than Gandolfini.The visuals seem similar to Se7en in that we see the seamier side of life one scene where the nun hands Cage the victim's suitcase and asks him to give it back to her family is especially touching. There are also a few subliminal references to religion the wealthy widow's name is Christian she lives in a compound isolated from the world but not protected from the harsh reality of her husband's perversion. Also as Cage is chasing down Machine well portrayed by Bauer BauerMachine's mother takes a bus to her church meeting and also has a statue of the Virgin Mary on her lawn.All in all an interesting film that could have been more developed. I have not seen the sequel. The fact that this is a Joel Schumacher film really has no bearing on anything The film itself represents a story presents it well and is worth watching.

	schema:reviewBody "8MM is a dark disturbing movie. It's literally dark due to the low lighting it has a mesmerizing but undeniably creepy score the performances from everyone involved are subdued and sinister and the subject matter above all is not exactly uplifting. It is not surprising then that many people are going to leave this movie with a disgusted feeling thinking that they have been tricked into watching a movie that left them feeling badly. On the one hand it should be noted that 8MM was never exactly advertised as light entertainment but even more importantly all of the dark elements above go together very smoothly even if not very happily. 8MM it cannot be denied is simply a dark movie and the way I see it there is no reason that that alone should count against it. Nicholas Cage takes on the role of Tom Welles who is a loving husband and father with a comfortable family life and is very similar to several other roles that Cage has played see The Rock and half of The Family Man for example except that his ultimate fate in this movie is something that has yet to be encountered by any of the other characters in his iconography. Having taken the rather unexpected turn after law school of pursuing a career in surveillance he was sure that it was going to be the big thing in the future he spends much of his time as a sort of private detective mostly for people who suspect that their spouses are unfaithful. His latest job the one with which the films concerns itself is the one that will Change His Life Forever as has become the saying about this movie.The widow of a wealthy man has hired Welles to investigate what appears to be a snuff film which was found in her late husband's private chamber wanting only to learn that the film is a fake and let the matter rest. Whether or not snuff films are real or are simply urban legends is a subject which the film wisely chooses to avoid for the most part. Welles explains to the woman that snuff films are made just like Hollywood movies with special effects and makeup and the like and that they don't really exist in real life but the rest of the film leaves the matter up to individual interpretation. The mystery surrounding snuff films is not something that 8MM seeks to resolve but is instead a starting point that the film uses to create an interesting story. From there we are taken on a wild ride through the depths of the Los Angeles underground porn world which is by itself probably the most destructive element of the entire film if only because it's so obviously overexaggerated.  You have the mindlessly twisted director Dino Velvet Peter Stormare who makes some serious porn videos with the sick and twisted content of your choosing and many of which star the charmingly named Machine. Then you have the unfortunate Max California who went to Los Angeles with lofty goals and wound up as a smut peddler in the underground and ultimately talks Welles into allowing him to give Welles a tour of the underworld of the sex trades a job that would also change HIS life forever and not necessarily for the better. And by the way does anyone know why Joaquin Phoenix keeps getting these less than enviable roles? That poor guy gets the shaft in every movie he's in!The tour that California gives Welles of the underworld of the sex trades is by itself the most hilariously unrealistic part of the entire film and by the way the fact that this character is named Max California' and I'm thinking Maximum California'  coupled with the fact that he is involved in this particular profession is clearly making a statement about The Golden State and there's really not a whole lot of room for individual interpretation as to what that message is. I'm not exactly an expert on anything that goes on in the illegal underground of any major city but I find it highly unlikely that there are basements under buildings down dark alleys that have stacks of porn which are labeled in large print as to what they contain one particular stack loudly labeled KIDS' comes immediately to mind. And even if places like this did exist it's even less likely that they would have one big guard standing at the door indifferently surveying the entering clientele about whether or not they are police officers. What does this guy expect? You a cop?' Oh yes as a matter of fact I am. Thanks for asking I'll leave you alone now.' I would like to have seen THAT guy suffer Max's fate.There are obviously a lot of moral questions presented by the film and they are presented in some pretty interesting ways not the least of which is the scene near the end where Welles telephones the mother of the girl in the alleged snuff film and asks her to talk him into killing who the man who made the film James Gandolfini who is wonderfully villainous in his role as the guy who is literally sick and twisted for no good reason. Welles knows that he is not a murderer himself even if this murder would be beneficial to the greater good of mankind and this is exactly the kind of help that he needs to commit such a murder. This is a very unique scene in that it's very rare for the protagonist to be so reluctant to kill the man who he has been searching for throughout the entire film especially because the vast majority of the audience will be rooting for this guy's death  I know I was. It is interesting to consider the motives of writer Andrew Kevin Walker  who is not a stranger to dark films that culminate in a hero forced to murder a despicable villain  in adding this scene in the film because it is the exact opposite of what we would expect from the typical Hollywood film. 8MM is a film that has a lot to say and not all of these things deal directly with the subject matter that it deals with. The existence of snuff films and the violent exploitation of various groups such as women and particularly children is the disturbing topic on which the film bases a number of questions about the uprightness of modern American society. We start off concerned with whether or not the snuff film is real then we're further astonished to learn that it IS real and finally we're left questioning ourselves because we were so eager to witness another violent death. It seems then that the film's main concern deals with the hypocrisy of American society in that we are shocked and disgusted by violence and death at the beginning of the film but then only a couple hours later we want nothing more than to see more of it served.".

	schema:reviewBody "8MM  1999 Starring Nicolas Cage Joaquin Phoenix James Gandolfini Peter Stormare Catherine Keener and Amy Morton Directed by Joel Schumacher. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker. Running time 123 minutes. Rated R for strong sexual content nudity violence and for strong language.By Blake FrenchJoel Schumacher's new disquieting thriller 8MM is the kind of movie that starts out hesitantly calm but contains an atmosphere where potentially detestable material may become apparent as if the film is preparing us for something much more bellicose. Sure enough a half hour into the picture we take possession of plot points regarding subjects beyond human imagination. Our very effective condition propels us into a sleazy world of hard core adult contents. 8MM is a tense dramatic production with tantalizing dialogue and a driving theme of action. There is a scene in the film in which a character explains a relative although somewhat overlooked concept. When you dance with the devil you don't change the devilthe devil changes you he declares as he walks down a long dark ally with another character. Nicolas Cage stars as Tom Welles a highly acclaimed private detective living with his wife Amy Catherine Keener and their newborn son in a homey relaxed country house. As the film opens he is called upon by the widow of an important political man Mrs. Mathews Amy Morton. This elderly woman has discovered the contents of her late husband's secret safe and his extremely concerned about some of them. Most of the objects found in the safe are normal. One in particular however a film strip is not what you would call ordinary but suspicious and concealed. Mrs. Mathews explains to Tom what he will see on this tape is something of unimaginable terror. Tom views the 8mm tape watching in horror as  a young girl is raped and brutally beaten to death in front of a camera operator a silent viewer and a muscular man wearing all sorts of SM clothing. The welldeveloped conflict brought to our attention at this point Mrs. Matthews is requiring Tom to find out if the tragic events that occur on tape are real or not and if her husband had anything to do with this atrocity. Welles opens a missing person's case and reports to his wife that he will be away for a few weeks on duty. He first searches through countless files containing young kidnapping victims. The results a fifteen year old girl named Marianne who ran away from home six years ago with the company of her boyfriend as they were heading towards Hollywood California. Next he converses with several key characters including her depressed mother a scruffy acquaintance and her so called boyfriend who is now serving time in prison. He claims Marianne ran off to work at a strip club. These characters point Tom in the direction of an underworld of snuff movies where he meets an adult book store clerk named Max California Joaquin Phoenix. He and Max become friends. After some negotiating our fellow porn genius agrees to share his knowledge with Tom and lead him to the makers of the 8mm snuff film. There we meet Eddie Poole a perverted photographer James Gandolfini Dino Velvet Peter Stormare a disquieted man who believes smut to be a form of art and The Machine the man in the SM mask who murdered Marianne in the video Mrs. Mathews found. 8MM has an excellently developed setup. A setup that indicates us on the snuff film as well as the setting character motives personalities dramatic premise and plot points. The only component that is missing is the history and or in depth elaboration on Tom Welles. With such an important character one who drives the entire narrative through line we need to feel a lot of empathy so that we may root for him. Unfortunately the filmmakers present the audience with only the minimum introduction. The side characters are also descriptive. In their own presence contribute to both the story and atmosphere. Director Joel Schumacher's work has always been some of my favorite. With movies like Falling Down Flawless and Batman  Robin I was never expecting him to construct a dark grim film such as 8MM. This feature is tasteless and nasty repulsive and unsettlingwhile all these bases are relentless within the context of the plot. No doubt many audiences will be offended throughout perhaps even to the point of where they walk out of the theater. This is a production on the verge of an NC17 rating and is adult in every atom of its being. The perverse and gritty character motives and mature subject matters all fitted appropriately here but the film still goes over the top in many areas. Some of the movie's characters are a bit too obvious. The villain for instance I could predict from the first five minutes he is on screen. Whenever there is a character who seems to have no cause or purpose in the plot he is normally the bad guy. Here although the character twists are effective and the casting is brilliant we receive several clinches that many views will be able to detect immediately.Nicolas Cage is obviously  the right choice for Tom Welles a man who is more submissive than brutal but is placed in a situation where deep down he desires bloodshed but knows his morals challenge him otherwise. 8MM is a movie that frolics with this character's emotions and values and at the same time lives up to a premise that is way out of his league.Brought to you by Columbia Pictures.".

He's not a bad director hell I enjoy some of his work yet I still cringe when I hear his name. Let's take a look at 8MM something that is the polar opposite of BR.It stars Nic Cage as a private investigator hired to find out if the content on an 8MM tape found in a safe of a recently deceased millionaire is real. The tape is referred to as a snuff film which is a pornographic film that ends with the murder of the female. So already we have ourselves a pretty dark and disturbing film here. Yet as I watched it I felt that is played it a little too safe.Upon research you will find out the writer and the director had a falling out over the film. The studio wanted it to be a bit lighter and the director agreed. While the writer who also wrote Se7en wanted to keep the gritty disturbing feel he had originally wrote. The final product is a film that tries to be more hardcore then it actually is.Nic Cage really seemed to be playing by the numbers here. He is more monotone then usual I thought and didn't really seem invested in his character. Joaquin Phoenix on the other hand immerses himself into this world. Playing the sidekick who is smarter then he looks. The supporting cast also includes James Gandolfini doing what he does best and Peter Stormare. Both stretch out beyond the page and embody their characters. With Gandolfini we've seen him do this character before. But with every performance there is just one little thing that makes them all seem different every time.I was really underwhelmed with this flick. It was a bit longer then it needed to be just over 2 hours. You go along for the investigative ride and are interested with the story but at the end you just feel empty. Never connecting with the relationship between the main character and his wife he neglects. Some scenes that were meant to be powerful came off as comedic to me specifically the Give me permission to hurt them bit near the end.I did enjoy the film but wanted more. The ingredients were there to make a really good film but the final product falls a bit flat. It's a rental or if you are really a big fan of anyone involved . I will say this though I wouldn't mind if Cage went back to making movies like this instead of the filler he's been cranking out the last few years.".

	schema:headline " Captain America  the origin story is revealed decent supehero movie ";
	schema:reviewBody "The origin story about Captain America is revealed as been a ultimate superhero in the MCU comics. The film was directed by Joe Johnston who directed The Rocketeer 1991 and Jurassic Park III 2001. This is a decent action superhero film and I love it so much. Chris Evans is Steve Rogers  Captain America his best acting performance I have eve seen on screen. Captain America The First Avenger is my personal favorite at top 3 MCU movies.Set in 1942 during WWII Steve Rogers Chris Evens the smallest kid from Brooklyn a 20something 90 lb 5foot tall asthmatic volunteers for military service in the United States Army. The army doctor rejects Steve's application as the military 4F as this is his fourth failed attempt to enlist. Dr. Abraham Erskine Stanley Tucci recruits Steve in a secret project while Steve Rogers volunteers and goes in to secret experiment in which turns him in to super soldier. With his best friend Bucky Barnes he goes on a missions to stop Red Skull Johann Schmidt commander of the terrorist organization Hydra played by awesome Hugo Weaving from The Matrix as Agent smith and V for Vendetta and of course as voice of Megaton in Transformers movies dominating the world. The men can play a good evil villains his talented gifted actor. Red Skull wants to dominate the world harnessing the power of the magical object known as the Tesseract.The movie is a good start and a good decent origin story about Captain America how he become a superhero. Yes this is my favorite MCU superhero character in the MARVEL Universe ever. I love Captain America so much and his shield that was build from Howard Stark Dominic Cooper father of Tony Stark. Hayley Atwell is Peggy Carter An officer with the Strategic Scientific who becomes Steve Rogers love interest. Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter Is decent in the movie I enjoy her she did a good performance and she was likeable. Toby Jones is Dr. Arnim Zola accomplice of Red Skull a scientist turning to evil who works with Johann Schmidt on Tesseract as an energysource for world domination. Excellent performance from Tobey Jones a good second villain he retuned briefly In a cameo scene in sequel smash box office hit Captain America The Winter Soldier.The movie has the second hour best action ever as Captain America is dressed in a new uniform rides a Harley with his shield and his mask charges the base. He dodges HYDRA soldiers on motorcycles in which they are chasing him. He puts booby traps with a rope he pushes the button for fire and blows up an enemy tank. He beats up Hydra's army soldiers with his fists and shield. He goes on a rescue mission by him self. Saves Bucky Barnes his best friend and 400 American soldiers who were prisoners of war. Captain stops the air plane before whole New York would be destroy fights off Red Skull in a battle of good VS evil that's why I think the film is a decent superhero flick my personal favorite MCU film in the MARVEL universe.This movie was shot so much better than Thor Ragnarok though. I prefer no shakycam  rapidedits.Splitting the difference we get an 910  an outstanding score.My biggest problem with the film is the first hour in which almost nothing happens. There is no action and I didn't like that Steve Rogers  Captain America become a music player playing his self on a music theaters with features dancing girls. I didn't like that much. The rest of the film it is solid I liked and love it very much. I love the capture of Dr. Arnim Zola on a train. Steve Rogers  Captain America is a decent superhero it is a decent and solid film with an origin story I love it.".

I got a group of ten friends and showed up hours early with Captain America merchandise and enough caffeine to stay up through Lord of the Rings in its entirety.What happened?Every single person in my group was disappointed. Needless to say we still enjoyed ourselves and I wasn't even expecting much Jumanji and Jurassic Park III at the top of the director's credentials but man I couldn't help counting the flaws throughout the film.Positive Chris Evans was surprisingly convincing. Also our hero was truly inspirational if not corny. The sets were nice and the other stars filled their roles well. I was well entertained and the first half flowed nicely.Negative Oh lord. I'll try not to nitpick. Most glaring was the absolute pathetic villain. Hugo Weaving a great actor who manages to give his character some well character plays a downright cheesy sappy crazy and so unmenacingitsnotevenfunny chum nicknamed Red Skull. His back story is never laid out and only hinted at a few times his followers are faceless drones with advanced weaponry but the brains and aim of stormtroopers and his intentions are ridiculously stupid and unexplainable his target is everything? Oh please. He was never threatening and never endangered our hero not to mention his death was as anticlimatic as they come Voldemort anyone?Also obvious is the clich invincibility of the Captain. He leaps twenty feet as flames engulf him he fistfights scores of goons blows up crap all over the place and never once gets seriously injured. Suspense? Apparently there's no need when you have patriotism!The technology was just plain silly for its era. Leaving out the cheesy blueshooting things something to do with the gods? I don't know it was kind of weird there are spycraft tanks the size of mansions helicopters that look like spacecraft singleperson submarines and my personal favorite manned bombers in the shape of bombs. Are they suicide bombers? Apparently.There is no attachment to the characters anyone blink when his best friend died? there are loads of forgettable scenes notably the war montage of which the trailer consists which might have made a good movie I might add and clichs love interest walks in on random kiss etc. and downright sloppy pacing galore.I must stop here but seriously 8.0? Not even close. Enjoyable fare but nothing to think twice about. Here's to hoping Joss Whedon improves upon Chris Evan's Captain in 2012.".

The guy is called Captain America for heaven's sake.Any comicbook reader would probably appreciate the ironies and idiosyncrasies behind such ostentatiously patriotic codename mostly because in print Cap has challenged the assumptions behind his symbolism becoming a more conflicted and universal figure.But its hard to translate any of this idiosyncrasy successfully in 2 hours. Fortunately the film instead of getting to political is more oldfashioned pulp like Indy or Sky Captain which thankfully never takes itself too seriously which was one of the flaws of Thor.I had my doubts that Chris Evans could pull off the modesty and heart needed for the role but I was wrong. As the Red Skull Hugo Weaving was wonderfully evil in a nostalgic serialvillain kind of way. Haley Atwell is a sidekickloveinterest with the rare quality of not being incredibly annoying and Tommy Lee Jones is perfectly cast as Tommy Lee Jones.The reason I found this to be a good movie was because I enjoyed it plain and simple. It's wellphotographed and wellacted. Like its titular hero it modestly embraced its silliness creating a charming Bmovie experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER Gee what a waste of money. I was unfortunate enough to catch a viewing of this uh film on its opening night. And I honestly had high expectations. But not unlike Thor it fell very VERY short. Here are a few of the problems I had with the movie. 1. No development. With EVERYTHING. No character development no plot development and no emotional development. 2. Mediocre acting. Enough said. 3. It was too overthetop. And this is coming from a Batman BeginsDark Knight fanatic. Red Skull was a seriously lousy villain. He was more laughable than frightening especially his cheap looking face. 4. The plot itself. I was honestly looking forward to seeing Captain America fight the Nazis not HYDRA. And the dumb Hydra salute made me gag. I also wasn't sure what was going on at times. The magical cube Transformers knockoff? wasn't settling with me. I expected this to be more about WWII itself not some stupid mystical idea that was more sophomoric and typical than interesting and captivating. 5. The technology. This was the WWII era. And there were little reminders everywhere that said Hey! It's the 40's! But then... Hydra's uh ray guns for lack of better terminology were somewhat thrown at us. I didn't like it. And the likely hood that a bunch of drunks with 40's weaponry could survive such combat. 6. The romance. Ugh. You can integrate a romantic subplot in a superhero movie and do it well I've seen it done Spiderman 2 The Dark Knight. But this was much too Thoresque. I'm sorry let me specify. You could see the chemistry between Steve and Peggy right away but it just kind of sat there until all of a sudden love! And of course with romance comes automatic romantic tension. Blonde kisses Steve. Peggy gets madjealous. Wow. Didn't see that coming. 7. The theme. Red Skull believing he's so godlike. I liked the idea. And I figured it would destroy him in the end. Hubris often does. It simply wasn't explored enough and it really didn't end him. I was left wondering whether it was a good idea to introduce it in the first place. 8. And so we've arrived at Red Skull's death. This was TERRIBLE writing an asinine story component. You know when you watch a movie like this and come to accept that it's mostly just raw superhero element you want the HERO to kill the BAD GUY. That's a formula we've seen from box office hits to ScoobyDoo. But no this film neglected even THAT. All Red Skull did was look at and hold the cube and he burned. What a let down. 9. Captain America's sacrifice. Ah sacrifice worked so well in The Dark Knight! And it almost worked here. Corny scripting ruined the moment. After Red Skull's demise Captain America had to get the militarized aircraft far away from the USA so its weapons wouldn't kill people. So what do you do? Nose dive into the ice caps. Naturally. Well I guess it was his choice. 10. The ending. Well it was necessary. And it was okay. I could live with it. UNTIL Steve chose to utter I'll be okay. But I had a date. or something to that effect. More corny scripting. 11. Hey all faults aside at least we had some good old action to keep the grin on our faces. Nope. The action was thrown wayside. The taking down of every Hydra facility was just clips of Captain America shooting a gun or jumping his motorcycle. That along with generic and easily forgettable scoring. Only a few funny moments and the fantastic CG scrawny Steve got this to three stars. Please stop comparing this unexceptional film to things like Raiders of the Lost Ark or The Dark Knight or any of the greats. This film was average at best. Marvel Studios is not preparing well for The Avengers. Based on this and Thor I certainly am not stoked for its debut. Thanks for reading!".

	schema:reviewBody "With the imminent Avengers movie coming next year only one hero's origin story remains untolduntil now. Falling in line with Thor Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk Captain America showcases the rise of Steve Rogers as the title character. Unlike the other films which take place in modern times this one goes way back to WWII showing the Captain kicking Nazi butt! With a lot of Wolfenstein style occult mystique and a slight Indiana Jones sense of adventure this movie has a number of solid action sequences and plenty of imaginative special effects and setpieces. With its references to various characters and concepts of other Mavel movies it fits into the franchise really well. It might take some stretch of the imagination to believe that Nazis could be this futuristic but for a superhero movie it's all good fun.The story in this case is pretty solid. The main character shows strong development and for most of the movie you really root for him. There's nothing more thrilling than watching the underdog getting the upper hand. As it goes on much of the character drama and story development gets pushed aside by the action but it still works. By the end voila we have the leadin for the Avengers film.If there's any complaint for this film it's that there could have been more. Whether it needs a stronger action setpiece or a more invoking sense of drama I'm not sure but something seems missing and nothing really makes this film stand over any of the other superhero films that have come out so far.The film is competently made with decent but never exceptional photography. Editing is good for the most part but I am not a fan of the montage in the middle of the film that makes the entire war campaign whiz by. A couple of action scenes seemed a little sloppilyedited but it's hardly noticeable. Acting is swell Chris Evans is surprisingly strong as the main character and I enjoyed Hayley Atwell Sebastian Stan Tommy Lee Jones Stanley Tucci and Hugo Weaving in their roles. Writing seems pretty good. Production value is high featuring lots of good if not overlyslick sets props costumes and special effects. Music is appropriately upbeat and adventurous. In the end I'd say the film met my expectations but never fully exceeded them. But it along with an alltooshort sneak preview after the credits provide the necessary bridge to the Avengers film.Recommended.45 entertainment 45 story 45 film 45".

The main character shows strong development and for most of the movie you really root for him. There's nothing more thrilling than watching the underdog getting the upper hand. As it goes on much of the character drama and story development gets pushed aside by the action but it still works. By the end voila we have the leadin for the Avengers film.If there's any complaint for this film it's that there could have been more. Whether it needs a stronger action setpiece or a more invoking sense of drama I'm not sure but something seems missing and nothing really makes this film stand over any of the other superhero films that have come out so far.The film is competently made with decent but never exceptional photography. Editing is good for the most part but I am not a fan of the montage in the middle of the film that makes the entire war campaign whiz by. A couple of action scenes seemed a little sloppilyedited but it's hardly noticeable. Acting is swell Chris Evans is surprisingly strong as the main character and I enjoyed Hayley Atwell Sebastian Stan Tommy Lee Jones Stanley Tucci and Hugo Weaving in their roles. Writing seems pretty good. Production value is high featuring lots of good if not overlyslick sets props costumes and special effects. Music is appropriately upbeat and adventurous. In the end I'd say the film met my expectations but never fully exceeded them. But it along with an alltooshort sneak preview after the credits provide the necessary bridge to the Avengers film.Recommended.45 entertainment 45 story 45 film 45";

	schema:reviewBody "Captain America The First Avenger is a pretty decent film by its own merits. Showing the good old retro style and production design since this film is directed by Joe Johnson who is capable of portraying the old times perfectly. Chris Evans did a great job as Captain America. Some of the action scenes are disappointingly unexciting but at least the CGI effects are eye candy. The movie ends with true patriotic heroism and full of heart. Definitely not new but it's still enjoyable.The trope of Captain America The First Avenger has been reused by so many superhero movies. A good guy who is a weakling became powerful then eventually saves the day. It's definitely not innovating even for the people who've never read the comics but it's a relic. Well made production design  the old fashion score. Most battle scenes are montages. The action scenes are large. It can be watchable but some of them are pretty bland and poorly directed.The joys and the thrills mostly goes to the performances. Nothing goes wrong with Chris Evans. He did a decent job as Steve RogersCaptain America. Hugo Weaving is fun to watch by his campiness and menace for the Red Skull. Tommy Lee Jones is the comic relief here. The special effects are everywhere. Skinny Chris Evans and the background of the 1940s. Well they are good enough for this film.Plenty of things worked in the end. Captain America The First Avenger is a relic in its old fashion style but a little messy when it comes to the editing of the action scenes but it's still enjoyable. Patriotic heroism full of heart Chris Evans and decent production design. Marvel Studios and Joe Johnston really beats the awful 1990s version. The action could have been better but their flaws can be ignored. It's fun enough as a superhero movie.".

	schema:headline " A great oldfashioned adventure that towers above its flaws.";
	schema:reviewBody "As there's something about the the 1930s1940s that appeals to me I tend to prefer movies set in the era and made in its cinematic style. And being fond of the adventure genre I anticipate movies like the Indiana Jones trilogy The Rocketeer Sky Captain And the World of Tomorrow The Mummy 1999 and of course Captain America.When I first heard about this movie my expectations soared. The director was Joe Johnston who made my favorite superhero movie The Rocketeer. It was set during WWII made in a 1940s style and scored by Alan Silvestri. Alas my heart sank after I found out that they were going to do the whole frozen alive storyline I've always hated. But I reasoned the only reason they are making it is because of The Avengers. Without that storyline they wouldn't even be making it. Beggars can't be choosers.Well after two years of waiting I got to see the movie. And to my surprise it surpassed my high expectations. I didn't even hate the ending although I would have much preferred a happier one more in line with the original 1940s comics in which Cap stays in his own era then fights commies in the 1950s. So here are my thoughts on the movie.Acting.Chris Evans was great as Captain America. He nailed the character. After watching him as Captain America I can't see anyone else in the role. The special effects performed on him to make him look skinny for the first part of the movie were absolutely seamless. If I hadn't known about them I wouldn't have been able to tell they were there. But those effects would not have looked nearly so great if it had not been for Evans convincingly acting skinny. No matter what condition Steve Rogers is in shrimp or super soldier Chris Evans portrayed him flawlessly.It was refreshing to see a nonangsty purehearted hero for the first time in a while. Instead of portraying Cap with irony or satire they took him seriously and it really payed off. Cap despite or because of his delightful simplicity and earnestness comes across as incredibly deep and human proving once again that the notion of the oldfashioned hero being inferior to his modern antihero counterpart is merely a haughty assumption.Hugo Weaving's Red Skull was effectively menacing darkly humorous and overall deliciously like an oldfashioned serial villain. Haley Atwell was charming feisty and classically beautiful as Peggy Carter. Stanley Tucci's Dr. Erskine was played to perfection Tommy Lee Jones was a scenestealer of the highest order Toby Jones was very memorable as a sympathetic almost lovable Arnim Zola Richard Armitage was effectively despicable Dominic Cooper was good as Howard Stark and Neal McDonough made his presence known despite very little screen time. Sebastion Stan was also quite good as Bucky although he wasn't quite as memorable as many of the others.Visuals and Action.My feelings on the visuals are mixed. I was hoping for a bit more of a photorealistic feel but it instead looks a bit too much like Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow a movie whose visuals I like very much but would prefer to be a novelty not the norm. That said the use of wide lenses did help make it look more real than many other movies with such massive amounts of CGI. The color in many scenes is quite good or at least by today's standards. I did dislike the muted color used in some of the winter scenes though. I wish they had gone for more of a Technicolor look but I'm pretty satisfied with the look of the movie except for the winter scenes.I didn't like the action montage too much as it had some slowmotion effects as well as giving off a feeling that you're being cheated out of some scenes. I also thought that the motorcyclechase felt somewhat rushed. Other than that however I did like most of the action scenes. The Kruger chase Cap's first mission and the final fight with Red Skull were standouts.I would have preferred that the HYDRA soldiers' uniforms look a bit more Nazilike but the look they have works well. Red Skull doesn't care about them as individuals. He is the Hydra and they are merely his many identical heads. Thus their faceless almost robotic look works very well. Music.Silvestri's score is the best superhero score in years. His main theme unfortunately doesn't have the flow that some of his better works do and seems a little clunky at first. But after you hear it a few times it grows on you. It's now stuck in my head. Overall Silvestri's score hits all the right notes and captures menace adventure and every other mood required of it while having actual themes. Media Ventures eat your collective heart out.Writing.The humor was great throughout. The levels of heart were set to maximum. The romance although sparse was memorable. Everything was portrayed swiftly without padding The plot was very well thought out. Memorable lines and scenes abound. Overall the writing was excellent. Some things that I particularly liked were Steve's journey from shrimp to supersoldier the USO scene Cap's first mission the rolereversal with Bucky and the romance. I also liked how Red Skull was his own boss. It gave him more menace. Plus using HYDRA ironically makes it feel more historically accurate. Having Captain America defeat the Nazis would mess with history too much and having him lose to them just wouldn't do. All I really disliked were Bucky's death and Captain America getting frozen alive. That could work well in some movies but a 1940sstyle adventure of this sort just cries out for a happy ending. Plus the modernday bookends detract from the overall atmosphere. Still the final scenes were poignant although outofplace.910.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really wanted to like this movie. After all the terrible superhero movies that have been released lately I was somehow hoping that Captain America would be different. It wasn't.I liked the idea of the idealistic but physically weak protagonist who was impossibly patriotic but beyond that the movie completely fails. I have never understood why superhero movies always feel the need to go completely over the top with outrageous supervillains. In this film Hugo Weaving plays Red Skull. The Red Skull mask looks like something a kid would wear for Halloween...it's that cheesy. Red Skull is apparently possessed with powers similar to Captain America but also has at his disposal an army of minions with very advanced and largely unexplained technology weapons. Yet these laser beam style weapons seem to do nothing for them.I guess I don't get it. Would it not have been enough for Captain America to simply be involved in fighting the Nazi juggernaut portrayed in a fashion similar to what history recorded? Wouldn't the Nazis be adequate villains for anyone? If I seem to be dwelling on this issue it is because for me the silly cheesy bad guys really ruined this movie.The movie also fails because it is obvious from the beginning that Captain America is basically invulnerable. It is very clear early on that nothing is going to happen to him. I was under the impression that his powers consisted of nothing more than being extremely strong and athletic yet his antics in the movie remind one more of Superman. Captain America's shield certainly cannot shield everything yet the protagonist is apparently completely immune to the effects of gunfire and laser blasts. Yawn. Even Superman had his kryptonite....I imagine the superhero formula is more difficult to pull off than it might appear and this movie fails yet again. It is largely silly and boring.I would recommend that you skip it.".

Chris Evans was supposed to play a warrior with a code of honor and a sympathetic heart and he qualitatively makes a frozen face in a heroic setting but thaws with facial expressions and gestures during dialogues. Haley Atwell is responsible for the romantic component symbolically arising after the acquisition of the hero pumped biceps and in the romance the main thing is to look good. Therefore the case is bright red lipstick and other mandatory makeup successfully diverting the viewer's attention  it does not matter to him that in places the emotion is not reached to the level required by the stage.Shikaren Hugo Weaving with his falsh accent which most likely will disappear in dubbing. Yes if it remains the voice will still not be the same but it was the voice of the Australian that animated Agent Smith from the Matrix Megatron from the Transformers V from the same neonoire ... The main villain will lose a lot when localizing alas this inevitably  we will only have to look at the red computer face well at least only from the second hour of the film. Tommy Lee Jones noted in the role of a kind and adequate colonel in the view of which there is always a sparkle yes yes I understand everything. Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones appeared in the image of German geniuses separated by the front line and Stan Lee ... Well he as always somewhere in the picture appeared for five seconds.Threedimensional graphics ... Music ... It was all but it was not created as a separate layer of glaze but as a cellophane package  just like a package that does not deliver any pleasure. It's not necessary to go to 3D except in scenes where a round shield flies along a closed path it's not impressive. Understand where the good and where the storm troopers you can and on a simple screen thanks to the sane operator and sane editor. According to the stylistics the stellar composition the absurdity of everything that is happening in the frame the tape is very close to the Cobra Brooch and even closer to the League of Outstanding Gentlemen. So with the preliminary assessment go  do not go I recommend doing a retrospective on these pictures and also not to lose sight of the fact that all this is a preparatory stage for the Avengers where already there will be solid berries ... Continuous cloudberry ...".

Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones appeared in the image of German geniuses separated by the front line and Stan Lee ... Well he as always somewhere in the picture appeared for five seconds.Threedimensional graphics ... Music ... It was all but it was not created as a separate layer of glaze but as a cellophane package  just like a package that does not deliver any pleasure. It's not necessary to go to 3D except in scenes where a round shield flies along a closed path it's not impressive. Understand where the good and where the storm troopers you can and on a simple screen thanks to the sane operator and sane editor. According to the stylistics the stellar composition the absurdity of everything that is happening in the frame the tape is very close to the Cobra Brooch and even closer to the League of Outstanding Gentlemen. So with the preliminary assessment go  do not go I recommend doing a retrospective on these pictures and also not to lose sight of the fact that all this is a preparatory stage for the Avengers where already there will be solid berries ... Continuous cloudberry ...";

	schema:headline " A Fun Ride That's Worthy of All The Praise! Bring On The Avengers!";
	schema:reviewBody "Captain America is a very very good film. I firmly believe that this character is the very toughest to bring to life in the Marvel stable simply because of his complexity. They did a fairly nice job keeping it simple but remembering to do so with heart. The film features a nice pace the perfect cast and wonderful throwback action sequences. It does have its flaws but not enough to sink the film by any means. Overall it's a fun ride that respectfully delivers a movie worthy of the legend and sets up for what could be amazing sequels and what will be an awesome Avengers film.The Good The cast is remarkable and every single character played to perfection. Tommy Lee Jones simply stole every scene he was in and his character had the audience in the palm of his hand. Best audience reactions throughout the entire film.Cap's wartime real costume look and shield work is amazing. It's right out of the books. The same can be said of the Red Skull's look.The brutality was not only welcome but needed. It grounded the film and made everything play out in a more real world tone with real consequences. The body count in this film is surprisingly high.The film had true heart because they made Steve relatable and you instantly rooted for him and wanted to follow his path to glory. The preserum 98lb weakling Steve is not only an amazing CGI feat but perfectly hooks the audience.A story featuring a true hero is so refreshing at this point. No dark brooding and moody antihero hereThe story itself is told with a very nice pace and in a crisp manner. Nothing drags at all. The dialogue is witty and the humor works its way seamlessly in to the natural order of the story. The tone and period work is dead on perfect. I loved the flavor of this film when the focus was not on anything Hydra.The Bad I really wish they had stayed entirely Nazi and left the Hydra element out laser guns and all. Having no learning curve hurt the overall film as well. What always works in origin films is having the hero learn and come to grips with his new powers or abilities. Iron Man and SpiderMan are prime perfect examples. I enjoyed Steve's initial use of powers because circumstances demanded it but they never showed him training or learning combat techniques at all. That's a terrible oversight especially since the character is known as the world's greatest hand to hand fighter in terms of the Marvel Universe. I would've liked to have seen more background on Steve as a character... growing up without a father and mother during the Depression era and the building of his ethical and moral code. Overall A great film that is one of the year's best and oh so close to being perfection. Wonderful job by all involved.".

	schema:reviewBody "Uncle Sam would be proud. Holistically this film looks like one mass recruitment campaign to get men enlisted into the US armed forces. Then again this is nothing new. As a superhero Captain America personified the might of the US military during the actual second World War to intentionally create a sense of patriotism against the 'Axis Powers' led by Stalin and Hitler. Picking up on that idea the well known source of this concept is Marvel comic books and brings to cinematic life a spectacular and glorious vision of how invincible a US soldier can or should be.Almost entirely the film is a flash back after a rare metallic shield is discovered in the present day Arctic region. Rejected by the military during WWII scrawny and frail Steve Rogers Chris Evans gets a second chance after a selfless act of bravery. As a result Colonel Phillips Tommy Lee Jones allows Dr. Abraham Erskine Stanley Tucci to administer Rogers with a serum immediately supersizing the latter into a Super Soldier. Shortly after Erskine is killed by an assassin deployed by Johann Schmidt Hugo Weaving. As Hitler's advanced weapons expert we learn that Schmidt has assembled an army to possess and control a mysterious cube with infinite power after being injected with a flawed version of the serum perfected for Rogers. Now christened 'Captain America' and literally draped in stars and stripes Rogers and Stark Industries must stop the evil Schmidt from destroying America with weapons of mass destruction.Cinematically the film is in epic form and relives the bygone era of the 1940s with a strong retro vibe. Having said that I now find myself educated that a fraction of WWII consisted of technology that still does not exist. Ray guns behemoth tanks onemanned submersibles and gunships that look similar to those used in Avatar? I wasn't alive in the 1940s but I am pretty sure that other movies with a 1940s or WWII narrative must have somehow omitted the use of this technology. Sarcasm aside and for argument sake as a viewer I can suspend reality for the sake of the Marvel universe. In an alternate history this could be plausible. X Men First Class was smart enough to establish that thought process right from the start. Shooting from the hip with pomp and propaganda The First Avenger expects rather than assumes viewers will believe the world created for the movie. It is at this point where you should stop and think for a minute. If you are not a Marvel OR superhero fan you will find the movie unbelievably ridiculous. As a casual moviegoer you will find the dialogue corny the action overthetop the hero invincible and the villain and his minions a joke. As a reviewer I normally judge films with either a sense of practical logic or its relevance to the genre. During this movie the superhero fan in me took over and I succumbed to its seduction.As an actor Evans has justified his upgrade from a supporting role in Fantastic Four to the titled lead in this movie. He has outgrown the brash ego of the Human Torch to a lovable underdog whose real driving force is his spirit of patriotism. Like Peter Parker is to Spiderman Captain America's alter ego in Steve Rogers is a simple man who uses his gift for the greater good of his nation and shoulders that responsibility with the heart of a true hero. On the other hand considering that every superhero must face an ever daunting and equally super villain Hugo Weaving has failed to radiate either hatred or fear as Red Skull this arising from my high expectations of Weaving.Known for the CGI infused Jumanji and Jurassic Park III director Joe Johnston pulls off an otherwise decent superhero flick and has laid a strong foundation for things to come. Call it a prequel reboot or pilot  in its entirety this film is a big teaser for a multibillion dollar franchise starting with 2012's The Avengers. The ending scenes of both Thor and The First Avenger has Nick Furry Samuel L. Jackson hint at just that. For superhero fans 2012 if we live through it will have plenty of such movies. While Superman and Spiderman are all set for a reboot the Batman franchise concludes with The Dark Knight Rises. In all this The Avengers is rumored to become the motion picture event of the year. The credibility of that rumor strongly rests in the success of The First Avenger. By the looks of it this movie has outdone all preceding 2011 superhero flicks and is on track to hand over the baton to what is going to be an explosive yet highly competitive summer come 2012.".

Captain America has had 3 movies in the past not counting some 1940s ones which can be excused for being good that were so awful they make movies like Steel or Green Lantern look good. However I saw a lot of critiques for this movie that were negative. Now I understand differing opinions and all but they all followed a formula and each one seemed like griping to the point it was just getting stupid. If you'll indulge me here I have a list of the repeated ones and a rebuttal to each.1. The technology for WWII is too far advanced! This one was the most common and the stupidest in my opinion. It's called Fiction as in not real. Every time I heard this one it made me think these people have no suspension of disbelief and would complain that Iron Man is a terrible movie because the technology to build a flying robot suit doesn't exist yet. People it's comic books and it's in a fictional WWII setting. It's allowed to take liberties.2. Captain America is too invincible! That was just stupid. Captain America is relatively weak compared to many other superheroes he's just a perfect example of a human being brought about by the experiments in the film. Also he's the main character. He's not supposed to die in a movie that is leading him up to be in a tiein to all the other recent Marvel films that will lead to The Avengers.3. Red Skull is a terrible villain.There is no sense to this one. He's supposed to be the guy that's worse than Hitler and can get just as many people on his side to do his bidding. On top of that he can take Cap in a fight fairly evenly. Saying he's a bad villain is baseless.4. Steve doesn't go through a character arcget any backstory.For one he really doesn't need to. Steve was a good guy from the start and he did go through an arc. It was subtle but he did. He gained more confidence and become the soldier he is. He has a backstory but it's weaved in throughout. We know he was bullied a lot we know he he is from a military family we know he grew up with Bucky we know he has had very few if any dates in his life he's a childhood friend of Bucky and we know he wants to be a soldier because he feels its his duty. I'd rather get it weaved in through the narrative of the story rather than get a huge text dump or just have characters talking for half an hour about everything they've ever done.5. This movie just glorifies America! Not really. It's a good vs. evil story that happens to have a character named Captain America which was given to him by a publicity stunt. I suppose you also hate movies like Saving Private Ryan because it tells things from the perspective of American soldiers but not the Japanese ones? These were the most common arguments and they are easily refutable. Captain America is a great movie showcasing one of the best Marvel has to offer and should be in the 7s or higher not the 6s.".

	schema:headline " An awesome installment as we wait for The Avengers to assemble!";
	schema:reviewBody "I had the pleasure of watching a sneak preview for this and thought it was a great superhero movie. It follows the superhero formula but that's to be expected. There are plenty of references to the comics as well as the other Marvel movies. There are numerous comic book references and foreshadowing that I probably can't even write here but will excite most of the comic book fans. In fact Howard Stark plays a prominent role in this film and you see where Tony Stark gets his charm. The movie really captures that patriotic spirit that permeated the US during WW2. The movie itself almost becomes like one of those military recruitment ads it showcases. It is chock full of flagwaving patriotism. But you probably should expect that going to a movie called Captain America.Chris Evans is a good Captain America and downplays any flashiness associated with him as the Human Torch. The CGI effects that show him as a scrawny twig were seamless. He carries that vulnerability with him throughout the film whether he is getting beaten up physically or emotionally. The rest of the cast fills their roles well especially Tommy Lee Jones as the gruff but lovable colonel and Hugo Weaving as the evil baddie bent on wold domination. Those two play their characters the way you would expect them to. Although I was waiting the whole time for Hugo Weaving to say Mr. Anderson. The only odd twist is that Captain America's sidekick from the comics Bucky Barnes is much tougher and older than you'd expect. There are numerous oneliners throughout the movie that drew chuckles from the audience. You also get plenty of action and explosions which are always a crowd favorite. Stylistically it's very similar to Iron Man. Overall it's a fun comic book adaptation that really adds into steam Marvel is building up to with The Avengers. Nice work.".

There are numerous oneliners throughout the movie that drew chuckles from the audience. You also get plenty of action and explosions which are always a crowd favorite. Stylistically it's very similar to Iron Man. Overall it's a fun comic book adaptation that really adds into steam Marvel is building up to with The Avengers. Nice work.";

	schema:reviewBody "I knew nothing about Captain America prior to viewing this Marvel film. Many people were skeptical about Chris Evans being cast as the man in red white and blue mainly because he is previously known for playing Johnny Storm in the not so fantastic Fantastic Four movies. Despite the fact that he had a lot of pressure going into this film I thought he did a fare job. I personally don't think this was the best Avengers tie in movie but it was fine. The first half of the movie did a very good job of establishing the story behind the creation of this man and how he was initially just an experiment and then turned into a propaganda piece for the war in order to excite people and inspire them to fight the fight. Afterward when he finally does take initiative and attempts to infiltrate and destroy the enemy the movie turns into a pretty standard and generic action movie. Hugo Weaving is cast as the villain known in the comics as the Red Skull. Despite a good looking face a red face he never really becomes too menacing and isn't given enough screen time as the red skull to really effect us. Tommy Lee Jones is in his realm as an army commander who is in charge of operations including Rogers and is very funny as well as delivering the lines extremely well. Speaking of lines this movie doesn't have the best or worst script and I think they the writers could have spent more time developing better dialogue that didn't sound so rushed. Director Joe Johnston who is know for The Rocketeer brings the 1940s World War feeling to the screen brilliantly and with great set designers and art direction. Tony Starks father plays a fairly significant role as the man behind the suit and weapons of the Captain. Played by Dominic Cooper we get an inside look at how Stark got his attitude and knack for building new technology. The 3D added nothing which is not unusual nowadays. The only time it was ever apparent was when the shield was thrown towards the screen which happened maybe twice. This movie does a nice job of finishing the tie in movie for the upcoming epic Avengers movie die to release next year. My only hope is that all of this build up with the individual super hero movies is not wasted. This is worth a rental and I will probably buy this on bluray when the price is greatly reduced.".

The action and effects all worked well particularly the transformation of Chris Evans into the scrawny preserum Steve Rogers and I suspect that there were lots of nice touches which meant a lot to those more familiar with the comics mythology of Cap than I am I got a flavour from time to time that others might know who soandso was but I didn't.As well as the big picture there were lots of small touches I liked  the early incarnations of the shield the use of the first comics costume the establishment of Steve Rogers as a bona fide hero even when he was a skinny weed for instance. But the thing I liked most about this film and to some extent it contrasts with many other superhero movies is the fact that much of what happened in this film really mattered both on a big scale and also on a more intimate level.

	schema:reviewBody "Rocketeer director Joe Johnston's Captain America amounts to a timeless David versus Goliath tale set in the Marvel Comics' universe where good always trumps evil. Unlike Thor and Green Lantern Captain America ranks as a thoroughly spectacular but largerthanlife extravaganza with a genuinely charismatic hero struggling against a marvelously malignant villain. Chris Evans' engaging performance as the 'First Avenger' is something else too! If you recall Evans had the time of his life several years ago playing egotistical Johnny Storm aka 'the Human Torch' in the two Fantastic Four flicks. Make no mistake Evans is nothing like he was in those two super heroic sagas. Indeed Captain America boasts some amazing special effects but its best special effect is the sincerity that Evans brings to the role of Steve Rogers. Whether he plays Rogers as either a scrawny 98pound zero or a brawny fleetfooted hero Evans imparts heart to this 140million thriller. During the first half of Captain America Johnston gradually builds the momentum to let us grow accustomed to Evans as a scrappy little fellow who suffers the wrath of bullies. This pathetic weakling refuses to let anybody keep him down and it's fun because Evans makes it look so authentic despite the obvious CGI effects. Hugo Weaving registers as the ideal villain who holds the upper hand throughout most of the supercharged shenanigans. Tommy Lee Jones and Hayley Atwell costar respectively as Captain America's superior and his love interest.Captain America opens in the present before it reverts to the past. Typically movies with contemporary openings and endings sacrifice any sense of suspense. After all you know if the characters thrive in the present that they must not have suffered in the past. Basically this constitutes nothing more than a narrative cinematic convention. The chief difference here is that we're only given a glimpse of Captain America's legendary starspangled shield instead of the eponymous protagonist himself. Anyway the film unfolds in the frozen wasteland of the Arctic Circle as a Russian oil expedition stumbles onto something buried in the ice. They contact the Americans who slice into the ice with a laser find a commodious craft of unknown origin and uncover a circular red white and blue shield with a star. The scene shifts to March 1942 as despicable Nazi officer Johann Schmidt Hugo Weaving of The Matrix and his men storm into Tnsberg Norway and confiscate an enigmatic tesseract. Essentially this is a magical cube boasting incalculable power. Supposedly the tesseract was a fabulous jeweled artifact that belonged to the legendary Norse god Odin. Once anybody lays their eyes on it they are no longer the same. Meanwhile in New York City the U.S. military brands Steve Rogers Chris Evans unfit for duty owing to a myriad of health problems. The resilient Rogers tries to enlist again when his buddy James Buchanan 'Bucky' Barnes Sebastian Stan of Black Swan takes him to a showcase of futuristic technologies. Dr. Abraham Erskine Stanley Tucci of Easy A eavesdrops on Rogers' conversation with Barnes about his desperate need to get into combat. Suitably impressed by Rogers' attitude Erskine allows him to enlist. Moreover Erskine recruits Rogers as part of a supersoldier experiment under the aegis of Colonel Chester Phillips Tommy Lee Jones of Coal Miner's Daughter and Peggy Carter Hayley Atwell of The Duchess. Phillips displays considerable skepticism about Erskine's contention that Rogers qualifies as the ideal candidate for the procedure. One day during a training exercise Phillips lobs a grenade among the recruits. Everybody but Rogers scrambles for cover while he smothers the grenade with his frail body. Predictably the grenade is a dummy but Rogers' act of selfsacrificing bravery convinces the colonel that he is the appropriate choice. No sooner has Rogers emerged from the procedure as an entirely new man with a buffed up body than a Nazi saboteur steps in and kills Erskine. As it turns out Erskine keep no notes except those in his head. After Erskine dies Rogers experiences his newfound strength and captures the saboteur. The saboteur lives long enough to warn Rogers that he has to face more of his kind before he crunches on a cyanide capsule and croaks. Roger wins fame and acclaim across the country but he suffers a setback because he is the first and only of his kind. Colonel Phillips reassigns him and Roger ends up at War Bond rallies where he acts like a cheerleader surrounded by dancing girls. Eventually when our hero learns that his best friend has been caught he disobeys orders and leads an inspirational rescue behind enemy lines. Now that Rogers has proved himself he must face the Red Skull. The Red Skull is Nazi officer Johann Schmidt and he is so ambitious that he not only wants to crush America but also Adolf Hitler. Talk about a villain to end all villains! Anybody who has read the reprints of the World War 2 era Captain America comic book should be thrilled with the way that The Chronicles of Narnia scenarists Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have handled the original material by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. Of course Johnston and his scribes have ratcheted up the hardware for the big transformation scene that turns Steve Rodgers into Captain America. Altogether Captain America is a predictable but entertaining comic book movie with sensational special effects and a sympathetic hero. If you are a Marvel Comic fan you should stick around after the lengthy end credits for a glimpse of the forthcoming Avengers film due for release in May 2012.".

	schema:reviewBody "Captain America has Star Spangled ActionCaptain America The First Avenger is the first major motion picture based on the venerable Marvel Comics superhero character that first debuted in print over 70 years ago. Since then there have been largely forgettable crossmedia interpretations including a 1940s movie serial and an aborted attempt at a television series in the late 70s that left two television films in its wake. With the power of Marvel Studios now wholly owned by Disney and partnering with Paramount Films for distribution Marvel attempts to return the luster to its onetime flagship hero that matches his mighty shield. Here Chris Evans Fantastic Four Cellular plays heroic shrimp Steve Rogers who in 1942 wants to enlist in the military but is determined to be a 4F. Still the little guy has heart as displayed when he keeps confronting local bully. His gumption impresses military scientist Abraham Erskine Stanley Tucci and gruff Colonel Chester Phillips Tommy Lee Jones. They put him through the paces of boot camp and finally reveal that he's the perfect test subject for their 'super soldier serum'if it works this shouldn't be a spoiler then Steve's musculature and reflexes will be boosted to virtual perfection. Alas the experiment's aftermath has a tragic end which poises newly buff Steve to be the sole supersoldier for the Allied Forcesthus 'Captain America' is born. Soon he is pitted against the nefarious Johann Schmidt Hugo Weaving aka the Red Skullan ambitious Nazi scientist who heads up 'Hydra' a superscienceweapons division of the Nazi army. Schmidt searches for an ancient artifact of power called the 'tesseract' allegedly giving its wielder the power of the Nordic gods themselves. Heady stuff this. The film's remaining supporting cast is capable including Sebastian Stan as Cap's best friend Bucky Barnes and Hayley Atwell as British agent and nominal love interest Peggy Carter. The script credited to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely features an antiironic sensibility here being fairly straightforward in its depiction of patriotism and earnest heroism as exemplified by Cap. This could have easily diverted into selfsatire or camp but the filmmakers including director Joe Johnston Jurassic Park 3 the Rocketeer wisely avoid this. Presumably to keep its comicbookreality credentials intact the movie plays fast and loose with the fictional history it represents the Red Skull's Hydra troops feature no swastika iconography and Cap's Howling Commandos team is racially integrated without a blink. Still the period designs are convincing enough including a nod to Frankenstein with the Super Soldier laboratory. Captain America is poised to be the first in a franchise of solo adventures as well as the introduction to the character's featured role in next year's The Avengers. Time will tell whether Cap regains his former fanfavorite glory his stalwart shtick may seem quaint compared to brooding avengers like Batman and Wolverine. Still the film gets enough right to stand out from the crowd and in a time of political contention provides plenty of flagfriendly good will.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK I've read a lot of reviews which complain about the lack of powerful opponents for Captain America in this movie. Well that's just the point Captain America was the great super soldier of the 40's from a time when Mutants were unheard of and the ones that were around were trying to keep their heads low. So of course Captain America can lay waste to the Nazis and if the Red Skull didn't run away at their first meeting not many as stated in another review Than the movie would have ended very quickly.Another thing that I think many people and even more from the younger generations seem to miss. Captain America was never about the power he possessed. So those wanting to see lasers shooting out of robotic hands or eyes or any other part of the human body of course are going to be disappointed. Captain America was always more of a symbol of good vs evil and how the underdog can become a hero. As is I think the energy weapons that were in the film were a bit of overkill.Captain America's origins were for a different age and I for one am glad they kept it as authentic as they did. Those that are just looking for flashy light effects over inflated superegos and a host of arrogant oneliners should check out the sequel which in keeping with the finest tradition of modern movies promises all of the above.".

	onyx:emotionText "OK I've read a lot of reviews which complain about the lack of powerful opponents for Captain America in this movie. Well that's just the point Captain America was the great super soldier of the 40's from a time when Mutants were unheard of and the ones that were around were trying to keep their heads low. So of course Captain America can lay waste to the Nazis and if the Red Skull didn't run away at their first meeting not many as stated in another review Than the movie would have ended very quickly.Another thing that I think many people and even more from the younger generations seem to miss. Captain America was never about the power he possessed. So those wanting to see lasers shooting out of robotic hands or eyes or any other part of the human body of course are going to be disappointed. Captain America was always more of a symbol of good vs evil and how the underdog can become a hero. As is I think the energy weapons that were in the film were a bit of overkill.Captain America's origins were for a different age and I for one am glad they kept it as authentic as they did. Those that are just looking for flashy light effects over inflated superegos and a host of arrogant oneliners should check out the sequel which in keeping with the finest tradition of modern movies promises all of the above.";

	schema:reviewBody "2011 is certainly the year for Marvel Studio seeing that Thor came out earlier in the year to good reviews and a healthy boxoffice considering he is a lesser known hero and Captain America has done even better with critics and a stronger opening. Added to that Fox's reboot of XMen was able to get that series right after the mess Brett Ratner left it in.Steve Rogers Chris Evans is a small skinny man with a number of health problems who wants to fight in the American Army in 1942. After numerous times of trying to enlist a German scientist Abraham Erskine Stanley Tucci sees his determination and good heart is able to pull some strings and gets him into the army. Rogers joins a special unit and is seen as the perfect candidate to become America's first super soldier giving him enhanced strength speed and healing abilities. In Germany the Nazi's secret science division HYDRA and its leader Johann Schmidt Hugo Weaving discovers a blue cube of energy and believes it could give him the power of the Gods and likes all mad scientists plans to take over the world. In America Rogers is made into a performing act encouraging the public to buy war bonds and given the name Captain America. But Rogers wants to fight in the war and is given his chance to take on HYDRA in 1943.I personally preferred Thor over Captain America but it still a fun summer flick and a solid 7.510. Captain America has plenty of references to Thor and the Iron Man films and shows how these franchise should be interlinked. Captain America is able to mix a light touch but making sure it treats the source material with respect and keeps it serious. Joe Johnston wouldn't have been my first choice to direct this film but certainly made it fun and he was more assured as an action director compared to Kenneth Brangh director of Thor. It was a fast paced actioneer but Johnston made sure they was enough time to let us know the characters and the set up for the plot. When Captain America first gains his powers the scene of him catching an assassin on top of a taxi reminded me a lot of the first Spiderman film a film that got mix of serious and lighthearted right. This was certainly a good introduction to character and the start for what should be another successful adaptation for Marvel.The humour throughout the film is deadpan and there are very good performance from the supporting cast especially Weaving Tommy Lee Jones and Tucci. Weaving certainly knows how to portray evil characters. Evans was able to instill Captain America's values of determination freedom strength and being a force for good. But the thing about Captain America is that he is a classic hero living in a world of absolutes of good and evil they is no ambiguity. And well Hayley Atwell is a token Brit so she gets a free pass.The score by Alan Silverstri it self has an old fashion grand feel to it and there were reminds to films such as the first Hellboy film starting during World War Two with the Nazis using mythology to gain an advantage to win the war and classic 60s and 70s war films like Where Eagles Dare.Captain America is an enjoyable blockbuster and necessary viewing if you plan to view The Avengers in 2012.".

	schema:reviewBody "Baz creates another super enjoyable visual spectacular! Although maybe not as good as Romeo  Juliet or Moulin Rouge! it certainly isn't much worse. Australia is a hugely enjoyable epic romantic adventure with plenty of exciting set pieces to keep you watching. I don't quite understand why nobody enjoys this? If Australia was made around the same time as Gone With the Wind I know that everybody would be drooling over it saying Oh it's the best film of all time! Or whatever you call Gone With the Wind I haven't seen it because Baz has created a loveletter to those old epics and it's a welcome breath of fresh air to our screens.At a hefty 3 hours long I was expecting to find myself getting a bit bored along the way like parts in Titanic and even Peter Jackson's King Kong seemed to drag a wee bit at the start. However not once did I feel bored or restless during Australia. This film isn't slow! It paces along beautifully don't expect a high octane shootout because it's a romantic drama for God's sakes mammy! The screenplay like all good epics manages to make you laugh manages to make you cry no I didn't cry but you might! And it also manages to transport you on the journey with the characters. I found Australia absorbing and captivating.The best part for me was the gorgeous cinematography. The whole film is magnificently shot with some aweinspiring scenery. Baz also shows off his incredible directing once again one of the highlights being the exciting cattle herding across the desert. Baz injects that wonderful life into the film once again as well as projecting a great story about a boy and his love for Nicole Kidman no don't be silly! And Hugh Jackman who sort of act as his surrogate parents. It's also about the love between Nicole And Hugh although I think I would've liked to have seen better chemistry between them. It seemed like the hated each other at times when they were supposed to be madly in love! Australia also boasts a really evil villain! Almost on the same lines as Christoph Waltz in Inglorious Basterds.So with some great characters who we can care about and also with some really exciting and beautifully shot scenes. Australia is another Baz masterpiece. It has all the ingredients for a superb epic romantic adventure. So why am I the only one who likes it?".

	schema:headline " Crikey! More Cheese than a Farmhouse Stilton.";
	schema:reviewBody "I have no idea what to make of Australia. It can't possibly be a serious movie right? It certainly starts as a camp comedy then lurches into a clichd action romance adventure before descending into an attempt at World War Two melodrama and finishing with a dubious helping of Elgar over a rather uncomfortable attempt at serious social commentary. Elgar? I mean why? My dictionary defines a farrago as a confused mixture a hodgepodge or medley. That sums up Australia perfectly a farrago. It has no idea what it wants to be so it attempts to be everything to everyone and fails at almost all of it. You can only get away with this stuff if you are really clever and have a well honed sense of irony and your tongue kept firmly in your cheek. Australia is neither clever nor ironic enough which is a pity because I loved Moulin Rouge but after watching The Man with One Noun The Drover send a band of wild horses galloping past the ranch house yet again for no discernible reason I turned to my companion and said I thought Australia might be Bonanza meets Monty Python.I'm sorry if this sounds cruel but when this much money is thrown at a movie and it turns out to be this inadequate I actually feel quite miffed. Had it cost 10M it might be excusable. At 100M plus it isn't. I never ever thought I'd find myself saying this but Nicole Kidman is probably the best thing in this film and the reason for that is because Kidman is actually quite good on the camp level see her in Moulin Rouge or Practical Magic  I have a problem with her as a serious actress The Hours Margot at the Wedding. Had director Baz Luhrmann stuck at the camp tongue in cheek genre we'd all have been better off. Instead he gets serious and we get a script in which  especially in the second half  every other line of dialog is a grating clich and competing story threads lead to superficial treatments of what could taken individually be quite interesting plots. I will say upfront that I don't blame any of the actors I think they all did a reasonable job given the material. I get the feeling that Kidman Jackman Wenham et al all took a deep breath tightened their belts firmed their jaws and said OK we've been paid for this let's give it our best shot. There's an enthusiastic let's put on the show in the barn feel to the acting. Or maybe it's me? The multiple stories there's an aristocratic woman arriving in an alien hot land to take control of a ranch which was her husband's purchase think Out of Africa but without Meryl Streep. There's a cattle drive across the Outback again heavily borrowed from Out of Africa and the criminally wasted diversion into the desert to try and find water which could if handled properly have led to some quite interesting drama. The heroine can't have children O of A again and takes up with an attractively roguish man Robert Redford  Hugh Jackman while taking on responsibility for the KikuyuAboriginals who inhabit her land because unlike 99.99 of the other white colonizers she has a conscience  surprise surprise. There are aerial shots of the Australian Outback  compare to the aerial shots of the Rift Valley in O of A  there's the pantomime villain Neil Fletcher played by David Wenham apparently picking up where he left off in The Proposition playing an identical character called Eden Fletcher  is there some significance to the name that a non Australian doesn't get? then we lurch into the bombing of Darwin and the rescue of the lost children. If there are movie awards for plagiarism Australia is in the running. It's an understatement to say it lacks originality.It's also far far too long falling into a genre I'm beginning to call the 'Depends' movie after the adult diapers required to sit through it  especially necessary when you realize that the only really acceptable way to watch Australia is after several drinks. Combine this with CGI which barely attempts to blend into the live action an almost unbearably cute kid Brandon Walters is heart melting plus a cast which features every Australian actor who's graduated drama school since WW2 and what exactly is this movie supposed to be? Even as an advert for the Aussie tourist industry I doubt it works as well as The Proposition which had better shots of dramatic Outback scenery. And how many visitors go to the Northern Territories to watch cattle droves? If Luhrmann really did edit this down from many more hours of film then possibly he can reissue a director's cut which works better. I see it working as a musical along the lines of Moulin Rouge. The corn is certainly as high as a kangaroo's eye.I went with a female friend who is a Hugh Jackman fan and I will if cornered admit to being a closet David Wenham groupie so we were well primed to enjoy this two girlies on a Friday night out  probably the target audience. But even Jackman taking his shirt off couldn't save it and believe me I've seen other movies where a Jackman shirt removal certainly did save the day. I have no idea how much they paid David Wenham to make this but it probably wasn't enough. It's not as bad as their other foray together Van Helsing but that's not saying much. And OK the costumes were pretty. But the rest? Oh dear. Oh dear. Oh dear".

There's a cattle drive across the Outback again heavily borrowed from Out of Africa and the criminally wasted diversion into the desert to try and find water which could if handled properly have led to some quite interesting drama. The heroine can't have children O of A again and takes up with an attractively roguish man Robert Redford  Hugh Jackman while taking on responsibility for the KikuyuAboriginals who inhabit her land because unlike 99.99 of the other white colonizers she has a conscience  surprise surprise. There are aerial shots of the Australian Outback  compare to the aerial shots of the Rift Valley in O of A  there's the pantomime villain Neil Fletcher played by David Wenham apparently picking up where he left off in The Proposition playing an identical character called Eden Fletcher  is there some significance to the name that a non Australian doesn't get? then we lurch into the bombing of Darwin and the rescue of the lost children. If there are movie awards for plagiarism Australia is in the running. It's an understatement to say it lacks originality.It's also far far too long falling into a genre I'm beginning to call the 'Depends' movie after the adult diapers required to sit through it  especially necessary when you realize that the only really acceptable way to watch Australia is after several drinks. Combine this with CGI which barely attempts to blend into the live action an almost unbearably cute kid Brandon Walters is heart melting plus a cast which features every Australian actor who's graduated drama school since WW2 and what exactly is this movie supposed to be? Even as an advert for the Aussie tourist industry I doubt it works as well as The Proposition which had better shots of dramatic Outback scenery. And how many visitors go to the Northern Territories to watch cattle droves? If Luhrmann really did edit this down from many more hours of film then possibly he can reissue a director's cut which works better. I see it working as a musical along the lines of Moulin Rouge. The corn is certainly as high as a kangaroo's eye.I went with a female friend who is a Hugh Jackman fan and I will if cornered admit to being a closet David Wenham groupie so we were well primed to enjoy this two girlies on a Friday night out  probably the target audience. But even Jackman taking his shirt off couldn't save it and believe me I've seen other movies where a Jackman shirt removal certainly did save the day. I have no idea how much they paid David Wenham to make this but it probably wasn't enough. It's not as bad as their other foray together Van Helsing but that's not saying much. And OK the costumes were pretty. But the rest? Oh dear. Oh dear. Oh dear";

	schema:reviewBody "OK I saw Australia back in December so I'm a little rusty forgive the late review. But looking back on this movie and just thinking about it really did help me in looking at the film and it's story. Australia was a movie that really tried to be the next Gone With The Wind for the millennium's audience. While it's a good movie it definitely wasn't great and went way over the top. It's a little lengthy in the time and the writing was a little over done BUT nevertheless it was still a good movie. It had terrific sets and was a beautiful setting it felt like watching one of the old classic movies that made you feel good. Well it was kinda like Titanic with the emotions you were up you were down you were laughing you were crying well you get the idea. The story is a bit much so I'm going to do the best I can to give you a decent summary.In 1939 Lady Sarah Ashley travels from England to northern Australia to force her philandering husband to sell his faltering Australian cattle station Faraway Downs. Her husband sends an independent cattle drover  called simply Drover to Darwin to transport her to Faraway Downs. Lady Sarah's husband who has been working hard to sell 1500 head of cattle to the military is murdered shortly before she arrives. Meanwhile treacherous FD cattle station manager Neil Fletcher is trying to gain control of Faraway Downs so that neighboring Lesley 'King' Carney can have a cattle monopoly in the Northern Territory which will give him negotiating leverage with the Australian army. The childless Lady Sarah is captivated by the young boy Nullah who was born to an Aboriginal mother and an unknown white father. When Nullah and his mother hide from the white authorities by entering a water tower his mother drowns. Drover is friendly with the Aborigines and therefore shunned by many of the other whites in the territory. Lady Sarah and Drover develop a romance and she gains a new appreciation for the Australian territory. But Carney's men poison all the water sources along the cattledrive route so the group risks driving the cattle through the dangerous Never Never desert which they accomplish with the help of King George. Two years later Drover and Lady Sarah have lived together with Nulla. But Drover who has been quarreling with Lady Sarah and has gone droving apparently never to return hears that she has been killed in the bombing of Darwin. Drover finds out about Nullah's abduction to Mission Island and sets out with Magarri and Ivan to rescue Nullah and the other children from the island using a sailboat. Whew OK I hope that summary is a good description of the movie since I haven't watched in a while but I did the best I could. So in a quick sum up the movie is worth the watch for the background it was worth watching in the theater. But you get the same effect if you watched it at home if you have a big screen TV and surround sound. Nicole and Hugh were a beautiful couple together they did the best they could for such a lengthy story. But the chemistry was on and the movie did work I think they just went a little too over the top on trying to make this movie into a classic or some kind of love fest for the Oscars. It's worth the watch but I'd recommend just watching it at home I don't think I can sit through a 3 hour movie again in the theaters I'm really loosing my touch.710".

Yes it's supposed to be an epic but things like this need to be handled with finesse. Unfortunately it isn't in this case. The themes were too muddled the script too stretched  it's a mess. The characters are cardboard cutouts the acting is over the top and cheesy the pacing is off the bizarre use of Somewhere Over the Rainbow... It's just a broken film.Being an Australian I did hope that this movie would be alright but it turned out to be almost 3 hours of wankery that disgracefully cost our taxpayers over 40m.On a more positive note on the whole it wasn't BORING and it was aesthetically and aurally pleasing  even though it made use of countless shameless green screen shots which were simply unnecessary.There was ONE great scene in the film and that's when Hugh Jackman and his Aboriginal friend enter the ruined pub. That was absolutely excellent. Too bad the rest of the film couldn't live up to that in the slightest.".

I don't know how any studio exec could read this script and greenlight it.

The only reason I didn't walk out was because I was in a group.Some of my friends and I had a good time laughing at it though especially the gem of a scene near one of the four or five endings. In this scene Jackman walks to Kidman on the dock just as the mist parts. She requests to journey home to which he replies There's no place like it. Classic. That drover is such a romantic renegade cut from the same cloth as Clark Gable.And one more thing Australia is hardly an appropriate title for this grand cinematic achievementit should be called Walkabout or He's Going on Walkabout. The word walkabout seemed to occur about 10000 times. If the director had cut out on that redundancy alone he might have shaved off the extraneous hour and a half of the film.".

He is played by Brandon Walters who is impressive in his debut performance.With Nullah playing narrator the viewer is introduced to Lady Sarah Ashley Nicole Kidman an English aristocrat who inherits her late husband's cattle station which is located in the Northern Australian city of Darwin.

Of particular mention is her vain attempt to herd cattle and a woeful rendition of Somewhere over the Rainbow to a clearly amused Walters.Jackman meanwhile evokes Clint Eastwood Harrison Ford and Humphrey Bogart to fine effect as the no nonsense hands on Drover while also providing eye candy for female viewers.Supporting roles are superbly fulfilled by top shelf Australian talent Bryan Brown is effective yet given a disappointing limited amount of screen time Jack Thompson seems to be gleefully enjoying his role as an alcoholic lawyer and a scene stealing David Wenham is all evil smirks and nasty attitude as the films key villain.Yet the most impressive character in Australia has to be its awe inspiring and vibrant landscape which is captured magnificently by cinematographer Mandy Walker.Unfortunately the films use of artificial visual effects does clash with the natural beauty that the outback projects.Australia is a film which clearly parades its influences on screen. References to The African Queen Gone with the Wind and Big Country are particularly notable.Yet it is no mere carbon copy of the films from decades past. Rather Australia is an enchanting throwback to an era of filmmaking which strived to entertain its audiences with dazzling spectacle and melodrama coupled with a historical snapshot of circa early 1940s Darwin and all of the beauty and ugliness that comes with it.".

I can't believe that such a great film like this received so many bad reviews while horrible and overrated films like The Expendables receive a lot of hype and praise.Australia was a great film filled with lots of emotions It has romance comedy drama and excitement. It is easily one of the greatest films ever made and definitely it deserves a lot of more appreciation.I can't believe that this film wasn't nominated at the category for best picture...Now that's unfair.";

Not because it is a better movie but because it's very different and a lot more ambitious. Of course that this has a downside and it's fair to say it as soon as possible Australia is flawed and longer than it should be and maybe just maybe one day it will be viewed as the dream come true of a man very much in love with cinema andlet's not forgetwith love.We shouldn't forget that we're talking about Baz Luhrman we should know what to expect sometimes. Therefore if the beginning of this film disappoints you a bit it's completely understandable. We meet a little boy named Nullah the very promising Brandon Walters who talks about races and unnamed countries about a lady everyone calls Mrs. Boss and the road that got her to Australia and more specifically to a place called Faraway Downs in the company of a man they call the Drover.Yes it's all quite confusing even more when Luhrman throws in a historical context that I suspect he doesn't really care much about. But everything is fine because we get to meet the stars of the show. Mrs. Boss is actually called Sarah and is played by Nicole Kidman with the same air and tone of voice she's been giving us the whole decade. Her job ends up being less risky than Hugh Jackman's who plays this Drover as a successful combination of what he's been giving us since he came into the scene the action hero the tough guy the romantic and sensitive lover and the sexy man who makes women scream.Maybe I'm not being critical enough but there's a scene in which the Drover appears dressed up in a suit cleanshavenI promise you that every women in the theater exhaled. Does this mean something to you? To me it means that Luhrman's dream is a reality. Three hours of film and not getting tired one minute? Not feeling disgust when listening to cheesy phrases and watching excessively dramatic moments? Australia is pure melodrama and I compliment its director for making it look that way without any shame. The keys can be seen all along the ride the repetition of clichd phrases the intense closeups the slowmotion parts of the characters the epic proportions of David Hirschfelder's score the establishment of a song that accompanies the characters through their endless journey and the use of narration in places it didn't need to be the same with some images.However the movie is one wonderful image after another cinematographer Mandy Walker from Australiathe country best of luck with the Oscar nomination you deserve and it wins the audience like few movies out there these days can providing delightful entertainment you may discuss if it does this fairly or if it cheats and it manipulates. You may also discuss the ambiguous ending.One more thing. As with any dream there's a moment in which we wake up and that moment for Luhrman has to do with believing his picture could get to the race of Best Picture contenders like his fantastic Moulin Rouge!. But as I said this movie is very different from the latter one and Luhrman is no James CameronThat one really had it the whole way.".

	schema:headline " Baz Luhrmann Stumbles Through This Sweeping Australian Love Story";
	schema:reviewBody "Australia is the kind of grand movie romance that defined classic Hollywood. It's got all the important ingredients A pair of movie stars exotic locales and a heaping helping of melodrama. In the capable hands of Aussie director Baz Luhrmann who knows a thing or two about movie love stories Romeo  Juliet Moulin Rouge Australia had 'classic' written all over it. Maybe with expectations that high Australia was bound to disappoint. In any case Australia is certainly not all it can be.Much like Gone With the Wind Titanic or Out of Africa Australia is a romantic epic that tells the story of an upperclass woman who falls for a dashing rogue. And that's not where the story similarities stop. Australia also takes place in a unique natural landscape and it's set against an important historical event. Australia is not just similar in story construction to these Hollywood classics it is a direct variation on them. I don't hold that against Australia. The formula obviously works and if you can put a worthwhile spin on it I'm all in. Australia has a distinct Aussie flavor and it's commentary on Australia's Stolen Generation is something we haven't seen in mainstream Hollywood. The cast is made up of just about every major Australian actor working with welcome turns by David Wenham Bill Hunter and Ray Barrett to highlight a few . Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman star and they are exactly what they need to be. Kidman does her thing as the uptight English outsider and Jackman was born to play the bushman with a heart of gold. There is almost nothing I can say against the structure of Australia. This exact story has been done before and done very well.As much as I hate to admit it because I really like him as a filmmaker Australia's problems start and end with Luhrmann. I suppose he must have had a passion for telling this story. He is Australian and I'm sure he felt an obligation to do justice to the country's history specifically the Stolen Generation but you can't really see that passion on the screen. This is a sloppy piece of work. For starters Luhrmann never quite finds the right tone for the story. The introductory scenes are kind of playful and more than a little humorous but as the film moves along the melodrama begins to take hold. It gives the film a jittery back and forth feeling as if competing ideas of what type of movie this should be were all thrown in together elbowing each other for space. The bigger blunder from Luhrmann is the look of the movie. The Australian Outback is one of the most beautiful places on Earth. It doesn't take much to translate that beauty to the screen. And while there are by sheer volume plenty of breathtaking vistas on display in Australia there are far too many ugly ones. Luhrmann relies heavily on sound stages and CGI backgrounds. Digital enhancement is of course not a dealbreaker in itself but the CGI here is so bad pervasive and needless that it almost does spoil the rest of the film. There is absolutely no need for this much CGI in a romantic Hollywood epic especially CGI that looks like a PlayStation 2 game. There is a long pivotal cattle driving scene in the middle of the film and I didn't believe that environment for one second. This is a production that is calling out for oldfashioned filmmaking and Luhrmann it seems doesn't have that in him. At least not fully. He tries to have his cake and eat it too when it comes to balancing the arthouse elements he's famous for and the traditional elements the material calls for. The result is a movie that is not artsy enough to separate itself from its obvious inspirations And not traditional enough to stand alongside them.This is a movie stuck in well No Man's Land. Luhrmann wants Australia to be a grounded drama about Australian history but he also wants a magic realism tale about an aboriginal twilight. It is not impossible to do both but Luhrmann only gives half his attention to each. I'm being hard on Australia only because I know it could have been great. The final product is not a bad movie. There is a surplus of ambition and conviction in both leading actors Kidman and Jackman and in Luhrmann as the director. This is a solid tale with enough admirable craftsmanship to get a pass from me but given its potential Australia is a major disappointment.64100".

	schema:headline " Luhrmann's Grand Epic That Is Australia";
	schema:reviewBody "I have been looking forward to 'Australia' for a long time. Though the experience from 'Australia' isn't as magical as Baz Luhrmann's spectacular 'Moulin Rouge' nor is it as well executed on the technical side but I still found it very enjoyable. 'Australia' works on multiple levels. The film is a mixture of adventure action romance and detailed history like in any larger than life epic movie. All of them are put well together in the film. Luhrmann's vast imagination and creativity is very evident in his portrayal of the aboriginal culture and how that's where the heart of Australia lies. To move the story further Luhrman shows the conflict of the aboriginals with the Europeans and its chaotic result. The film introduces plenty of historical themes and serves as a thumbnail. Yet Luhrmann does not shy away from experimenting with the magical side of his film. The main story itself is very formulaic but enjoy it like you would see a Hollywood blockbuster and roll along.The Australian landscape is dazzling to look at. It's a country that has always fascinated me and arises my desire to go there and such movies only remind me of that feeling. Mandy Walker's cinematography is fantastic allowing landscape itself to serve as a key character for obvious reasons. The lighting could have used some betterment especially in the action scenes where they used blue screen filter it was painfully obvious. I also felt that the CGI was overused and at times it does interfere with the natural beauty in the background. The soundtrack is awesome as its a mixture of spiritual beats and old classics.At the centre of 'Australia' is an Aboriginal child of mixed race Nullah who is played by a likable Brandon Walters. Even though Walters doesn't exactly get it 'right' with scenes that demanded him to display complex emotions he does very well with the comic scenes and does not go over the top by 'being cute'. A vivacious Nicole Kidman is absolutely marvelous as the strongminded Sarah Ashley. She displays her knack for comedy is superbly restrained in the emotional sequences and shares a wonderful chemistry with her costars. Hugh Jackman's Drover may have been inspired by Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones Paul Hogan's Crocodile Dundee and the dozens of famous Clint Eastwood characters. Jackman pulls off the part quite naturally. He and Kidman are magic on screen. The supporting cast is commendable. I liked the actors who play the colourful characters at Ashley's ranch. Jack Thompson provides some brilliant comic relief. Bryan Brown has a strong presence in a limited role and David Wenham is menacing as the evil Fletcher.Luhrmann's attempt to entertain and amuse the viewer seems genuine and the man has done a lot of research and enlightens the viewer of Australia history. Forget these 'Titanics' and 'Pearl Harbours'. 'Australia' reminds us of the time when people enjoyed grand movies such as 'Gone With The Wind' and 'The Wizard Of Oz'. Through the numerous references this movie pays tribute to many of the classics that have made a place in the history of cinema. Yet this enchanting movie stands on its own.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have been looking forward to 'Australia' for a long time. Though the experience from 'Australia' isn't as magical as Baz Luhrmann's spectacular 'Moulin Rouge' nor is it as well executed on the technical side but I still found it very enjoyable. 'Australia' works on multiple levels. The film is a mixture of adventure action romance and detailed history like in any larger than life epic movie. All of them are put well together in the film. Luhrmann's vast imagination and creativity is very evident in his portrayal of the aboriginal culture and how that's where the heart of Australia lies. To move the story further Luhrman shows the conflict of the aboriginals with the Europeans and its chaotic result. The film introduces plenty of historical themes and serves as a thumbnail. Yet Luhrmann does not shy away from experimenting with the magical side of his film. The main story itself is very formulaic but enjoy it like you would see a Hollywood blockbuster and roll along.The Australian landscape is dazzling to look at. It's a country that has always fascinated me and arises my desire to go there and such movies only remind me of that feeling.

	schema:reviewBody "Australia was actually much better than I expected after hearing some rather uncharitable things about it. Yes it is flawed but you can't help think there are a lot of good things about it. Visually Australia is absolutely striking and captured beautifully on camera by Mandy Walker the first five minutes especially. The music score is absolutely beautiful and is careful not to overshadow the most dramatic of scenes particularly the scenes with the cattle. I would also like to say that despite talk of trouble between Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman both stars turn in very believable performances and David Wenham is good as Neil Fletcher though I had a problem with the way he died I will confess I was expecting him seeing as he had a spear in his body to die quicker than he did. But Brandon Walters is simply brilliant as Nullah. At first I was put off by the length but the length wasn't actually the problem as it is supposed to be an epic. One flaw I had with the movie was that there is a fair amount going on like the love affair the moving of the cattle even a couple of murders the problem was I never quite understood what the film's main focus was supposed to be though in the film's defence some scenes are very well developed and raise a couple of tearjerkers. When I first heard the song Somewhere Over the Rainbowthis is in no way a criticism but at first I wasn't sure what the significance of the song was then as the film progressed it was like a communication of hope. I will say that my main problem with the film was the ending. The scene itself was beautifully shot and quite moving but it was the music that bothered me. As much as I like Nimrod by Elgar it is a beautiful piece that reduces me to tears however the film is about Australia so I wasn't sure why they decided to use a piece of music that is actually British so was rather irrelevant to the film's context. Despite the flaws I did like Australia enjoyed is probably inappropriate for the film's genre and me my mum and dad were left streamyeyed at the end of the film. 810 Bethany Cox.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having resisted the urge to see Australia for many months I finally hired the Blu Ray version because my mother in law was staying over for the night. I thought I'd get something suitable for an octogenarian lady who likes nice films with pretty people in them.Well it turned out she'd seen it and anyway she and my wife were off to a show at 8pm so I'd have to watch it all by myself a one night rental you see.We have a home theater set up with high quality HD projection and a large 12 foot screen... perfect for expansive Blu Ray vistas. I thought I'd get at least some Academy Award nominated eye candy out of Australia if nothing else. Not being a big Kidman or Jackman fan I was hoping some of the supporting roles would hold my attention.I was glad I could watch Australia alone as it made my laughing out loud and the tears rolling down my face sometimes simultaneously less embarrassing.This is a wonderful sprawling completely overdone yet breathtakingly entertaining movie. I'm not interested in where it fits into the Baz Lurhmann body of work. I watched Australia for itself as a one off experience... and the film delivers a cornucopia of cinema treats.Be warned to enjoy Australia you have to suspend disbelief. That is a given. Don't look for a sensitive subtle academic treatment of the plight of the Aboriginal Stolen Generations redolent with citations statistics and sober commentary. This film presents the situation crystallized around the story of one little boy as a representative of the thousands who were removed from their mothers and fathers destined for lives as domestic servants in white homes or as cheap workers on white cattle stations in the Northern Territory.Likewise the depiction of the mystical Aboriginal holy man is not meant to be taken literally. To my mind the director's intent was to bypass stuffy academia and get to the soul of the Aboriginal person's ties to the land which after all go back tens of thousands of years. There is no more magic in this movie than in any of the Indiana Jones movies or Star Wars films where the ability to rip out a beating human heart magic stones that ensure prosperity the Arc Of The Covenant as a force that can destroy armies a mystical chalice which will impart immortality to those who drink from it or The Force which enables levitation of large spacecraft and the manipulation of minds... all these are accepted by most filmgoers without demur. The same could be said of any of a thousand successful movies the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy even Ghostbusters. They assume from the start that their viewers will willing to suspend disbelief. This film requires that too.Once your disbelief is checked at the door you can sit back and indulge yourself in Australia. It is a film about emotion not a documentary. It's whether the emotional truth of the film often melodramatically worn on the director's sleeve can grab your own heart and allow you to wallow in it unashamadely.Other reviewers have said here that they were able to watch the whole film with rapt attention from beginning to end. I join those ranks and proudly. There is hardly a moment when the action  emotional or actual  is not hitting you right between the eyes be it the stunning vistas or the awful badness of the baddies the tender first kiss between the Drover and Lady Sarah or the razor's edge existence of the young creamie boy Nullah always on the run from the wellmeaning but misguided authorities who would breed the Aboriginal out of him.Sure there are some CGI sections that at first seem way over the top even comic booklike in their execution. But I'm not sure these weren't intentional. I wonder whether they were deliberately done they way they were to reinforce the magical and mystical thrust of the story? Yes in Australia there are elements and style quotations from scores of previous movies. It pays homage to Indiana Jones all four of them Out Of Africa Star Wars any of the great westerns The African Queen Pearl Harbour yes Darwin really was bombed by the Japanese just after Pearl Harbour with great loss of life even The Wizard Of Oz. The latter was used as a metaphor for the boy's journey from grim reality to a mystical land full of evil characters good fairies and magic animals. When he finally gets to see the movie itself I'll guarantee even the most hardened eye in the audience will be struggling to hold back a tear.The music was an eclectic collage of emotional cues from the original score thru the Hollywood musical and on to Elgar's Variations with jazz swing and bobbysoxer dance themes in between. Why not? The visuals and the sound reinforced each other reaching not for footnotable citable truth but for emotional truth which is what all good films have ever done.This was a great film completely contrary to my preconceived notions of what it would be like to watch. It receives from me just about the greatest accolade I can offer any move it's one I know I will watch over and over again and get more out of with every viewing.".

Both have their weak moments that drew more than a few tears from me.Baz showed how great a story teller he is by using all the hooks he can think of. Magic music love memories anger fear hate awe and hope fill this movie as much as the natural beauty of Australia fills the screen. Don't think for one moment there was no soft imaging or CGI because there was when it was needed. Oh and thanks for not letting Nicole sing the whole song. That was a wise choice.

It will truly be a surprise if Luhrmann is ever entrusted with a big budget movie again. But then again don't underestimate the stupidity of movie studio executives. It is obvious from the closing historical captions about the fate of the Aborigines that the screenwriter conceived this script as a story to be taken seriously. However from the start of the zippy graphics and jump cuts a la Moulin Rouge and Romeo  Juliet transporting you from continent to continent this technique gives you the feeling you're in a confused tongueincheek Indiana Jones matine. I doubt this was the director's intention as this jump technique was dropped after the first 15 minutes. In Moulin Rouge and Romeo  Juliet these sudden camera jumps were effective used throughout and complimented the film. In Australia it appears there may have been more but were ultimately abandoned as an idea that did not work.Then there's the allknowing mystical everpresent aboriginal grandpa whose character watchfuleye and even little magic fires looking down from the mountain are right out of The Lion King playbook the coincidence was hilarious and embarrassing. Furthermore the characters are cartoon cutouts as if this was a live action version of some corny graphic novel dumbeddown for 10 yearolds.And the poor film composer stuck with copying the temp score which must have worked so well for the focus groups. How depressing for the film composer to be demoted to mere arranger rehashing and reworking Arvo Part's music throughout obviously used as the temp track among other old orchestral favorites.However was it entertaining? OK I admit in parts. When the audience was not laughing at the delivery of the dialogue and bogus direction there were some pretty stunning scenes such as the cattle drive. But did the film need to be almost 3 hours? Well ask the execs at Twentieth Century Fox and the box office returns. I feel sorry for Australians who were delivered a parody of some very serious WWII era issues. What an insult to their intelligence their history and their country.".

General Kuribayashi however does not favor the rigid traditional approach recommended by his subordinates and resentment and resistance fester among his staff. In the lower echelons a young soldier Saigo a poor baker in civilian life strives with his friends to survive the harsh regime of the Japanese army itself all the while knowing that a fierce battle looms.

My wife and I both enjoyed Flags and were pleased when we learned that Clint Eastwood made a second movie this time telling the story from the Japanese perspective. As luck would have it we going to Japan for the holidays so we decided to try and see the movie in Tokyo during our trip. We went to the Ginza area of Tokyo and to our surprise the movie was completely sold out. We needed to buy tickets at least one day in advance. Further we learned that the movie was currently number 1 in Japan. Wow  that's impressive that an American made movie would become number one in Japan! Way to go Clint! After a little extra planning and some adjustments to our schedule we bought advance tickets and came back the next day.We completely loved it. We were moved and stirred with many emotions including anger anger over the horrors of war. We actually liked it better than Flags of our Fathers. The movie was in Japanese and as near as we could tell Japanese appears to be the native language of the film. There were brief moments of English American solders talking one flash back scene before the war during a foreign dignitary dinner and of course the credits at the end. The movie would have to be translated andor sub titled to English in order to have half a chance in the US. Frankly I think translation would take away from the movie's beauty and meaning. I understand a limited amount of Japanese so I could follow most of the story. The theater was very big and packed. I was a little uncomfortable at first I may well have been the only American in the place. My wife who is Japanese and I sat next to an older couple. At several points during the film I thought I noticed the man from the couple crying. When the film ended my wife talked with the couple and learned that the old man's father died in Iwo jima. Later during the trip speaking with Japanese friends and seeing the Japanese news stories of lost loved ones from the war were common and this movie for the Japanese people has brought many of these memories out in the open.To the Japanese Iwo jima was a part of their homeland where a foreign invader was going to land and begin its invasion on Japanese soil. Throughout all of recorded Japanese history never had a foreign invader prevailed in war against the Japanese on Japanese land. The imperial Japanese government of that time used this when they sent fighters to Iwo jima. These fighters were to ordered to fight to the death defending their country. That to loose and not die fighting would bring disgrace to self and family. They knew that America was planning to send an overwhelming force and they knew that they were being sent to die. For Americans Iwo jima was just another far away place and different point in time where American boys were sent and where unfortunately some lives were lost fighting for freedom. My god have we become that blas about the wars our sons and daughters are being sent to fight in? My wife and I are unique not typical American movie goers. I'm American my wife is Japanese. Together we've visited and cried together at the Abomb Dome in Hiroshima and again at the Arizona Memorial in Hawaii. I have relatives who fought in the Pacific she also has family who fought in the war and who lived in Hroshima. I have two sons now serving in the US Marines. Together my wife and I watched and enjoyed both movies. The movies really didn't bring anything new historically to us about Iwo jima. But the movies did do an excellent job reminding us that the ones who pay the price for war are normal everyday people. People who really don't understand the reasons or the politics behind why they are being sent to die. People who live love and are loved by family and friends. People with dreams and ambitions. But for some reason when called by the leaders of the time they go forward obey orders and do their duty. Sometimes paying the ultimate price.I've grown up with Clint Eastwood and it has been a wonderful entertaining journey. These two movies are in my opinion his best. Not because of the action or the drama or any of the other things that Clint Eastwood is known for but because he's given us two interlinked stories about the affects of war on the people who are called to pay the ultimate price  people like you and me. We may be from different cultures eat different food speak different languages prey to God differently but we all have things in common. We all live love want to be loved and we dream about and long for peace. And sometimes we are called to serve and pay for the opportunity. Thank you Clint.".

Their general speaks English so he begins talking to this soldier whose name we later find out is Sam. Although the two men should be sworn to kill each other they are able to have a connection in the one conversation they have. A while later the general comes back into the room only to discover that Sam's wounds have killed him. He searches him for a while and discovers a letter written by his mother. The letter is full of words that truly come from the heart of this kid's mother and by the time the general finishes reading the letter every soldier in that cave has realized that Americans aren't these savages these hatedriven murderers. No they all realize that Americans are exactly like they are and that they don't want to be there and want to return home safely just like their enemies. I believe the point that Clint Eastwood is making with his Iwo Jima saga is just this these two enemies were far more alike than they had imagined and they were both fighting only in hopes of returning home safely to their family. As for the specific film itself. In just about every way imaginable this absolutely brilliant film is a step up from Flags of our Fathers which is not something I say easily as Flags is a terrific film in my opinion. From the acting of the incredible ensemble cast most notably from Ken Watanabe's Oscarworthy performance to the film's delicate but powerful script to the beautiful imagery of the film the color distortion could not be any more brilliant than it is here to Clint Eastwood's absolutely perfect knowledge of film and what works in a film like this. Many people are wondering whether this will be able to compete for Best Picture at the Oscars this year. It is true that just about all of the film is spoken in Japanese but the truth is that Eastwood has created nothing short of a masterpiece with this work and a foreign language doesn't even come close to making that extremely obvious. I think that this film is very comparable in quality to Steven Spielberg's who is one of the producers of the film Saving Private Ryan. Although Spielberg's film has more entertainment value as it features more action and has an opening scene that cannot be contended with Eastwood sends out an even more powerful message about war than Spielberg did as it turns out that watching soldiers battle with no way out makes you feel the pains of war more than watching the soldiers on the invading side of the army. The fact that Ryan was able to strongly compete for Best Picture and just about win the award makes me very certain that this film has great chances even if Martin Scorsese seems to be tough to beat at this point. What I think allows this to compete with The Departed is the fact that this film doesn't take the cool route that Scorsese took which isn't something that the Academy has honored in the past. The score written by Kyle Eastwood Clint's son captures the feel of the movie better than any score written for any movie this year. It is very quiet music but listening to it makes you think about all the people that die as victims of war. To sum it all up Letters from Iwo Jima is one of the greatest war films ever made and is easily does the best job of depicting war as something that harms all involved that I have ever seen. Clint Eastwood has with this achievement engraved his name as one of the greatest American directors in film history.".

Or all American soldiers in Cuba tortured POWS from the wars in the Middle East. You can't group people together like that.This movie shows better than any other film that there's really no good guys or bad guys when it comes to war. War is just pointless.The movie is not supposed to be a documentary so the people who bash it for little details should go rent a documentary if thats what they want to see.Also Clint Eastwood deserves major credit for telling both sides of the war. Too many war movies always show the enemy as heartless monsters when it reality its never like that.This is without a doubt the best movie of the year. Make sure you go see it.".

	schema:headline " unlike 'Flags' this time Clint Eastwood's war epic has more cohesion in its complexities and a stronger punch with its theme";
	schema:reviewBody "It was worth it for producerdirector Clint Eastwood to tackle on a second part to his now twopart duo of Iwo Jima movies. With Flags of Our Fathers Eastwood tried for very ambitious ground in covering what it's like for Americans to fight a war worth fighting for but with life's value undermined in the scope of preserving the 'grander' scheme of things like the flag on the mountain. Unfortunately the screenplay with that film was also muddled and denied Eastwood's usually assured hand as a storyteller and conveyor of proper moods. But with Letters From Iwo Jima a slightly radical departure from the usual Americandirected war picture by showing the action totally from the side of the other there's a stronger sense of what it meant for the Japanese to fight this war and the nature of sacrifice and what it means to oneself in relation to one's society national pride and to one's mindset. And this time the screenplay doesn't do TOO MUCH of a jumpingaround method with the narrative. It's visceral in scope and personal in tone and there's always an assured hand in dealing with the performances and characters.We're also shown unlike in other war films how the homefield advantage doesn't always yield positive results. Even though the Japanese had Iwo Jima and had the capabilities to defend it for a little while without reinforcements it would be all for not this is compounded with some of the most tragic irony when towards the end the General Kuribayashi listens to a radio broadcast of children singing a song meant for hope of success in a battle that those on the mainland have already abandoned. No matter what though Kuribayashi believes in his men no matter how in spots morale is already low when the digging on the beaches begin. Saigo a lowly peasant is a part of the fight and for chunks of the film we see the battle from where he stands even as he doesn't look on it too optimistically. Plans are made the General orders for tunnels to be dug in the center of the island against advisement though under good thought to do so and then even before the ships and huge fleet of troops land comes the bombs from the air. The desperation as the battle continues and trudges on becomes almost too crushing for the weakest of the soldiers and soon all thoughts of cohesion within the ranks breaks apart.It's in many of these scenes that Eastwood garners his most dramatically charged moments in either one of the Iwo Jima movies. Maybe it's almost too easy though when seeing this movie taking out of context what was shown in 'Flags' one might think that the Americans had the battle on a silver platter. But taken back into context there's a greater sense of loss on the enemy side not just of life but of what it means to fight for a cause that is never totally explained to an Emperor practically all of these soldiers wont see or meet and that to kill oneself is a brave act against the odds. The scene where many soldiers in the cave kill themselves with grenades and then with two of the soldiers finally deciding that this is insanity and fleeing from the bodies is very affecting. Then added to this we see the letters being written how the humanity of these people can never be denied no matter how hopeless their situation seemed to get. Sometimes we're also provided with flashbacks for some of the characters some like a man talking to his unborn child in his wife's womb are too atypical but there is one that leaves a very lasting impression involving the murdering of a dog a scene that left people in the theater gasping even after so much battle carnage already happened.Though mostly we're stuck in these caves and tunnels with these soldiers one of the exceptions of this Shimizu was in said scene with the dog there are other small vignettes like the lieutenant who decides to break away to strap some explosives on himself to blow up an enemy cannon only to fall asleep and once awakened forgetting the whole act. And of course the ones who could not think of any other way in fact seeing it treasonous otherwise than to not sacrifice oneself for the homeland. All the while the acting is always competent sometimes even ranging into the brilliant and with Ken Watanabe delivering some of the finest notes of emotion and also holding back emotion or hiding a real emotion that I've seen from him thus far. And as far as the technical side Eastwood and his crew have created an appropriately very dark looking picture with the color desaturated so as to look like it's not really black and white but as if the life has been sucked out so as to look terminally gray if that makes sense with the battle footage somehow even more convincing than in 'Flags'.So in the end the two Iwo Jima movies bring up a lot to ponder about what it is to fight in war what it means to be akin to the varying degrees of nationalism and how it affects the psyche of people who were plucked from very normal lives into circumstances of perpetual death and if one lives the memories. While one doesn't really need the framing of it being 2005 at the end and beginning of the film there's enough here to mark it as a significant fascinating achievement for the filmmaker.".

	schema:headline " An absolute must see simply tremendous";
	schema:reviewBody "After much anticipation I was finally able to see Letters from Iwo Jima. I had left Flags of Our Fathers with a smile on my face saying now that was a great war film and it would be hard to match. Letters from Iwo Jima not only matches Flags of Our Fathers but also surpasses it and went on to tie Saving Private Ryan as the greatest war film I have ever seen. I sat numbed after viewing this film and look forward to watching it again.Unlike its predecessor Letters from Iwo Jima follows one story line set on the island of Iwo Jima. Saigo is a baker who was recruited into the Imperial Army of Japan and is stationed on Iwo Jima. General Kuribayashi soon arrives and takes command of the poorly fortified island. Tensions develop between army commanders and Kuribayashi as he fortifies a plan to defend the island. Soon the battle begins when a massive American Fleet arrives planning to take the island within 5 days. Kuribayashi is determined to inflict as much damage and loss of life upon the American's before he will give up the island. The whole while Saigo and his comrades write numerous letters home in the hopes of getting some sense of what home is.The film is terribly realistic and loaded with violence. However in no way does Letters from Iwo Jima glorify warfare. Eastwood portrays battles for what they truly are bloody and horrific. We are shown everything from men being lit on fire to being blown to bits to suicides by grenades. We are shown the true futility of war and how each side understands so little about the other. The film is a great message of antiwar just through showing what war truly is bombardments death destruction and bloody.Kazunari Ninomiya to my big surprise is a member of a Japanese boy band. When I went to read through the profiles of some of the actors I expected to see a long list of films but was amazed to only find a few films and the bit about him being a member of Arashi the band. Ninomiya does a fantastic job. We really feel for him but he is not made out to be entirely sympathetic. He shows much disdain for some people around him and occasionally runs his mouth toward fellow comrades especially Shimizu. Saigo is a very believable character and Ninomiya portrays him quite well. I applaud his performance.Ken Watanabe gives perhaps the performance of his career. His stunning deliverance of lines and the sheer look of him on the screen is enough to make a viewer sit up and listen to everything he has to say. He gives off the true sense of a man who is a great military commander but also a human being. We are shown him writing home and also told of some of his past. It is quite moving to hear his views on the war the battle and of his men. Kuribayashi is one of my favorite military men in history and Watanabe did a great portrayal of him.Ryo Kase closes out the lead actors. He is a silent fellow who is looked on with much disdain from Saigo. Saigo believes Shimizu to be a member Kempeitai the very strict and often corrupt military police of Imperial Japan. This story is eventually expanded on later in the film. I felt the most sympathy for Shimizu for he had no intention of coming to the island is not liked by anyone for an assumption by two fellow soldiers and represents some of the ignorance that was put into soldiers back in World War II viewing the enemy as savages though he later states he knows nothing of the enemy.What the movie does so well is its portrayal of humanity and the ignorance that is at the root of international conflicts. The film portrays both the good and the bad of the Imperial Japanese Army. The good side being Lt. Col. Nishi and the bad being Lt. Ito. We come to realize that most Hollywood films that make the Japanese Army out to be savages are dead wrong and that both sides on a war are very much human. The most poignant scene by far involves this when Nishi cares for and speaks with a dying Marine. It shows that understanding must occur for anyone to have peace with another in the world.Letters from Iwo Jima is a powerful film. We are shown the good and the bad of both sides. The film is about 98 in Japanese with three or four scenes spoken in English. The cast is all Japanese which was a must for the film giving it a more authentic feel to it. The battles are gritty and real and will shake you up. By far a tremendous film with an amazing message of humanity and survival. The one message I got from it the most was as spoken by Lt. Col. Nishi Do what is right because it is right.55 stars".

	onyx:emotionText "After much anticipation I was finally able to see Letters from Iwo Jima. I had left Flags of Our Fathers with a smile on my face saying now that was a great war film and it would be hard to match. Letters from Iwo Jima not only matches Flags of Our Fathers but also surpasses it and went on to tie Saving Private Ryan as the greatest war film I have ever seen. I sat numbed after viewing this film and look forward to watching it again.Unlike its predecessor Letters from Iwo Jima follows one story line set on the island of Iwo Jima. Saigo is a baker who was recruited into the Imperial Army of Japan and is stationed on Iwo Jima. General Kuribayashi soon arrives and takes command of the poorly fortified island. Tensions develop between army commanders and Kuribayashi as he fortifies a plan to defend the island. Soon the battle begins when a massive American Fleet arrives planning to take the island within 5 days. Kuribayashi is determined to inflict as much damage and loss of life upon the American's before he will give up the island. The whole while Saigo and his comrades write numerous letters home in the hopes of getting some sense of what home is.The film is terribly realistic and loaded with violence. However in no way does Letters from Iwo Jima glorify warfare. Eastwood portrays battles for what they truly are bloody and horrific. We are shown everything from men being lit on fire to being blown to bits to suicides by grenades. We are shown the true futility of war and how each side understands so little about the other. The film is a great message of antiwar just through showing what war truly is bombardments death destruction and bloody.Kazunari Ninomiya to my big surprise is a member of a Japanese boy band. When I went to read through the profiles of some of the actors I expected to see a long list of films but was amazed to only find a few films and the bit about him being a member of Arashi the band. Ninomiya does a fantastic job. We really feel for him but he is not made out to be entirely sympathetic. He shows much disdain for some people around him and occasionally runs his mouth toward fellow comrades especially Shimizu. Saigo is a very believable character and Ninomiya portrays him quite well. I applaud his performance.Ken Watanabe gives perhaps the performance of his career. His stunning deliverance of lines and the sheer look of him on the screen is enough to make a viewer sit up and listen to everything he has to say. He gives off the true sense of a man who is a great military commander but also a human being. We are shown him writing home and also told of some of his past. It is quite moving to hear his views on the war the battle and of his men. Kuribayashi is one of my favorite military men in history and Watanabe did a great portrayal of him.Ryo Kase closes out the lead actors. He is a silent fellow who is looked on with much disdain from Saigo. Saigo believes Shimizu to be a member Kempeitai the very strict and often corrupt military police of Imperial Japan. This story is eventually expanded on later in the film.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is so good. Probably even great. Like other movies it shows the horrors of war. Letters From Iwo Jima gives a real genuine feeling too it. You really feel scared for all the characters involved. By no means is it stating something new by showing the negatives of war but what it does have that other antiwar movies don't show well. It is realistic more than anything it shows the past lives of the soldiers briefly yet it feels like you know so much about the character. This movie is the Platoon of this decade.The directing was great in this movie. Clint Eastwood does such a masterful job here. Showing landscapes of the island the incredibly large fleet of the U.S. He really is able to teach you some history in this film without having to state facts. Usually subplots of characters in these war movies spin out of control and just confuse or bore you. This movie is done just right because of the directing. Eastwood does not put too many characters yet he is able to show the responsibilities and feeling of certain ranks from the general down to a simple private.All of this has to do with great editing. This movie could have easily fallen into a 3 12 hour novelsoap opera. Instead the movie jumps from scene to scene so fluidly and consistently that you want to see more and more.The acting was great. Ken Watanabe led a pretty much unknown castat least to me giving great conventional yet original portrayals to their roles. The acting made it so easy to get into this movie and the characters. Ken Watanabe was fantastic in here perfectly displaying the pressures of a general. He is able to show how their needs to be some sort of hope to survive no matter how bad times can be.The music was spectacular. It stuck out so much and gave me as mentioned before such a genuine feeling. Every part of this movie was great and in my opinion is better than some recent World War II such as Saving Private Ryan A Thin Red Line or anything else that I have seen from the past 1015 years.You could see that this movie was done so well and with so much feeling. It was not made to impress people but too make a real statement. That is what makes the movie so great. You can see that well funded movies can still be powerful. This movie is a sign of hope from the movie industry that has seemed to become more and more commercial. I know I'am repeating myself but that is because this movie reminds me of such great war movies such as The Deer Hunter Platoon Born On the Fourth of July Apocalypse Now and The Killing Fields. These were all powerful movies and this has go to be right up there. Just shows the power of foreign movies when they are actually noticed and somewhat funded. Remember this movie by no means had a big budget.".

This is one of the few movies I've ever seen that brings a tear to my eye.Plot This movie deals with the Japanese side of Iwo Jima. It shows how the Japanese army fought and shows how they suffered probably more than any military in the entire war. The Japanese were dedicated and probably the best fighters in the entire war. Except for a few scenes the movie is all in Japanese but that doesn't take away from the power and impact this movie has.Acting The acting is great. Ken Watanabe gave a fantastic performance as General Kuribyashi. The one who played Saigo gave just as good if not a better performance making a sympathetic character who just wants to go home.GenreQuality This is probably the most emotionally effecting and powerful movie I've ever seen. Never has a movie effected me like this. Never has a war film shown the horror of war like this before. The music was the same throughout the entire movie but it had a great impact. They had a piano and trumpet version. It sounded like a funeral which fit perfectly because Iwo Jima was lost before it even started. The sound editing is great won Academy Award. The battle scenes are very well done. The only flaw was that they didn't show a timeline. The Japanese held the island for 36 days but it seems like 5. The only other flaw is that they don't make clear exactly how many men there are.This is probably the most emotionally powerful movie I've ever seen. It has a greater emotional impact than any movie I've ever seen. With a strong story great acting and a good message against war this is a must see movie for everyone.1010".

	schema:headline " A new kind of war film";
	schema:reviewBody "I know Flags of our Fathers sort of went out with a whimper and wasn't entirely well received by critics and audiences despite the hype and anticipation after Eastwood's last string of movies but I personally liked it  a lot even. I thought it was a brilliant study of heroism in wartime as the American people see it as opposed to what true heroism in the immediate reality of the battlefield. It served both as an intricate study of the affects of postwar heroism as imposed on three people just because they lifted a flag and also as a detailed and fascinating account of US Army politics during World War II and a chronicling of the legendary battle on Iwo Jima and the subsequent media frenzy over the photograph taken there. I'll admit though the film suffered from some flaws one major one being a total lack of deep and interesting characters which in turn kept us the audience distanced from the events unfolding in the film. And then Eastwood hit us with his companion piece Letters from Iwo Jima which chronicles the same battle from the Japanese side. And with Iris Yamashita's beautiful and resonant screenplay Eastwood makes up for all the flaws in the previous film and fills in the gaps  If anything Letters from Iwo Jima completes and deepens Flags of our Fathers but also and perhaps subsequently improves upon it greatly.Truly the greatest asset of the film and the one that really separates it from Flags of our Fathers is its emphasis on the human angle. The film truly is a fascinating character study with emphasis on General Kuribayashi Saigo the baker and others. Their characters are so well rounded and fleshed out it's practically impossible not to feel an immediate connection which as I mentioned I felt was the biggest flaw in Flags of our Fathers. These aspects come out in full force in Iris Yamashita's brilliant screenplay. Eastwood and Yamashita take such delicate care to develop these characters and round them out it's impossible not to be affected by them. We are treated with flashbacks that further detail how some of the characters arrived on the island and what they were like before and we see perfectly just how deteriorated they are after being sent to war. Alongside the characters' stories though we are treated with the chronological unfolding of the battle on the island from the Japanese perspective. As an educational tool and an historic chronicle the film also works wonders as it taught me a lot about the Japanese side of the battle and just how they were prepared and conducted.The acting is truly phenomenal. All of the actors do incredible extraordinary work although I must single out two actors in particular who really blew me away. The first is Ken Watanabe. I haven't seen any of his native work but I can safely say based upon his American studio work The Last Samurai Memoirs of a Geisha and of course this film that the man is a force to be reckoned with. I simply hope that he is not reduced to roles in vain of Chow YunFat or Jet Li in their American films. He adds such an atmosphere of wisdom intelligence and determination  quite the opposite of how the Japanese enemy is usually portrayed in WWII films. His character is entirely human and not reduced to a suicidal angry general type which is probably what many people would expect. The second is Kazunari Ninomiya who plays Saigo. What a heartbreaking performance this actor provides. He is small scrawny not built for war. He has trouble fitting in. His expression is that of constant exhaustion. But his determination to live and to honour his general over himself is touching and fascinating to watch. His delivery and performance in general is absolutely stunning.In terms of themes the most intricate and important aspect of the film is its examination of the psyche of the warfare itself. In Flags of our Fathers like in his earlier films such as Unforgiven Eastwood portrays an examination and dissection of heroism and what it meant both for those who are labeled heroes and those who did the labeling. With Letters from Iwo Jima Eastwood studies the exact opposite of the spectrum glory. It's almost as if Eastwood is more fascinated with the Japanese comprehension of heroism than the American one. The Japanese soldiers in the film don't have such a thing as heroism to begin with. What they do have is glory and honour. They accept their clear and present defeat with humbleness and modesty perhaps too much so as they rather take their own lives than fall into the hands of the enemy. If Flags of our Fathers was a criticism of wartime splendor and heroism Letters from Iwo Jima is a modest glorification of these elements.In all with Letters from Iwo Jima Eastwood creates a new kind of war film that stands quite apart from its counterparts both because it portrays the side of the enemy but also and especially because it takes extra special care in emphasizing the human aspect of the soldiers it depicts humanizing and characterizing them to endless extent. As a psychological study of warfare and as a history lesson Eastwood has crafted a truly masterful and meaningful piece that's riveting and fascinating as it is intricate and complex. One of the best films of the year.".

I'll admit though the film suffered from some flaws one major one being a total lack of deep and interesting characters which in turn kept us the audience distanced from the events unfolding in the film. And then Eastwood hit us with his companion piece Letters from Iwo Jima which chronicles the same battle from the Japanese side. And with Iris Yamashita's beautiful and resonant screenplay Eastwood makes up for all the flaws in the previous film and fills in the gaps  If anything Letters from Iwo Jima completes and deepens Flags of our Fathers but also and perhaps subsequently improves upon it greatly.Truly the greatest asset of the film and the one that really separates it from Flags of our Fathers is its emphasis on the human angle. The film truly is a fascinating character study with emphasis on General Kuribayashi Saigo the baker and others. Their characters are so well rounded and fleshed out it's practically impossible not to feel an immediate connection which as I mentioned I felt was the biggest flaw in Flags of our Fathers. These aspects come out in full force in Iris Yamashita's brilliant screenplay. Eastwood and Yamashita take such delicate care to develop these characters and round them out it's impossible not to be affected by them. We are treated with flashbacks that further detail how some of the characters arrived on the island and what they were like before and we see perfectly just how deteriorated they are after being sent to war. Alongside the characters' stories though we are treated with the chronological unfolding of the battle on the island from the Japanese perspective. As an educational tool and an historic chronicle the film also works wonders as it taught me a lot about the Japanese side of the battle and just how they were prepared and conducted.The acting is truly phenomenal. All of the actors do incredible extraordinary work although I must single out two actors in particular who really blew me away. The first is Ken Watanabe. I haven't seen any of his native work but I can safely say based upon his American studio work The Last Samurai Memoirs of a Geisha and of course this film that the man is a force to be reckoned with. I simply hope that he is not reduced to roles in vain of Chow YunFat or Jet Li in their American films. He adds such an atmosphere of wisdom intelligence and determination  quite the opposite of how the Japanese enemy is usually portrayed in WWII films. His character is entirely human and not reduced to a suicidal angry general type which is probably what many people would expect. The second is Kazunari Ninomiya who plays Saigo. What a heartbreaking performance this actor provides. He is small scrawny not built for war. He has trouble fitting in. His expression is that of constant exhaustion. But his determination to live and to honour his general over himself is touching and fascinating to watch. His delivery and performance in general is absolutely stunning.In terms of themes the most intricate and important aspect of the film is its examination of the psyche of the warfare itself. In Flags of our Fathers like in his earlier films such as Unforgiven Eastwood portrays an examination and dissection of heroism and what it meant both for those who are labeled heroes and those who did the labeling. With Letters from Iwo Jima Eastwood studies the exact opposite of the spectrum glory. It's almost as if Eastwood is more fascinated with the Japanese comprehension of heroism than the American one. The Japanese soldiers in the film don't have such a thing as heroism to begin with. What they do have is glory and honour. They accept their clear and present defeat with humbleness and modesty perhaps too much so as they rather take their own lives than fall into the hands of the enemy. If Flags of our Fathers was a criticism of wartime splendor and heroism Letters from Iwo Jima is a modest glorification of these elements.In all with Letters from Iwo Jima Eastwood creates a new kind of war film that stands quite apart from its counterparts both because it portrays the side of the enemy but also and especially because it takes extra special care in emphasizing the human aspect of the soldiers it depicts humanizing and characterizing them to endless extent. As a psychological study of warfare and as a history lesson Eastwood has crafted a truly masterful and meaningful piece that's riveting and fascinating as it is intricate and complex. One of the best films of the year.";

It simply lacks what makes it a really interesting movie. Letters starts with a present day scene of excavators digging up remains of the war in Iwo Jima and finding letters in a cave that were written by Japanese soldiers and officers during the war on Iwo Jima island it then travels back in time to WWII and story revolves around those whom their letters were found during the dawn of the American invasion on that island. Slowly the movie loses its grip over its audience becoming something closer to an audio book and survival becomes a repetitive process!!!Everyone seem to be praising the film for being told from the other side and its true you don't see that many American film makers do that and although the film didn't just speak Japanese it lived and breathed Japanese it couldn't escape the limited framework of Hollywood this is very visible through the good characters all the good honest or lovable Japanese characters were either American sympathizers who lived in the US for a while and kept saying how a great nation the US is or are Japanese people that do not care for the Imperial system and would not mind handing over the island to their rival Americans. On the other hand all Japanese loyalists were mean American haters. Even the resolution of the strict Imperial soldiers was that the Americans were not as evil as they were told. But still everyone was very fond of the fact that the movie was told completely from a Japanese point of view. However just because Eastwood is an American film maker making a Japanesepointofview movie doesn't make the film any better than what it really is the film's ratings seem to be getting higher just because there is an American film maker behind it and I disagree it is what it is regardless who the people behind it were.The film was also highly praised as a companion film to Flags and while together they form a great duo on its own Letters does not achieve greatness.Why did Eastwood and Spielberg decide to make Letters from Iwo Jima this calm instead of making an adrenalinepumping film? My guess is that they did not care about the average audience and the commercial success as much as they did care for the story's integrity.Majd Selbi".

It wasn't that they were portrayed poorly they were plenty convincing and even interesting. I was certainly curious about what was going to happen to them but curiosity is where it stopped. I shared no emotional or sympathetic bond with any character I did not need for any of them to survive I did not suffer when any fell. I'm not entirely sure why this is. Is it because of cultural differences? Is it because they were speaking another language? I think it must be that somewhere in the back of my mind I knew I was watching the enemy. These people were in situations at least sometimes I could sympathize with and displayed extremely admirable qualities I just couldn't invest emotionally in anyone. It wasn't until an injured American made his way onto the screen that I could feel my heartstrings being pulled. Granted that may be because it was the most amazing scene in the movie but I think it's really because they started speaking in English and talked about places I had heard of before.The film is truly remarkable what it put me through. I've never watched a war movie except through a Western set of heroes and they are generally the victors. Eastwood made me examine myself more thoroughly by being placed somewhere so foreign. I'm not saying my default attachment watching the Japanese is necessarily wrong or immoral who knew I was so patriotic? but it was certainly there with me in the theater. I thought myself more enlightened more a member of the global village. This movie revealed that perhaps I am not. A lesser film I don't think would have allowed for so much introspection.It is an American that commits the most heinous acts in the movie. The most amoral thing I might have ever seen done on film and I'm shocked how quickly I thought Well war does terrible things to people. If the Japanese had done something comparable as they do in the companion piece FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS I probably would have thought instead What a messed up culture.Why none of these fine actors were nominated for an Academy Award I don't know.".

Letters succeeded in this with magnificence and showed the true terror and hopelessness of the Japanese cause by the time the invasion of Iwo occurred and yet had a poetry to it. It was almost as if Eastwood channeled the spirit of the late master of Japanese film Akira Kurosawa and directed more than a movie he directed a bleak yet beautiful film.

The film surpasses Eastwood's tandem effort Flags Of Our Fathers in my estimation but then they are two quite different films even though they have the same historical battle at their core.What's difficult to understand even as the movie makes clear is the average Japanese soldiers' willingness to die in battle for honor and duty to the Emperor and homeland.

It's hard to imagine that an entire nation operated on that principal just a little over a half century ago.The vignette pieces of Eastwood's film serve the story well as the backdrop of the invasion creates a realization that Iwo Jima will fall without additional Japanese troops or air cover to provide reinforcement. Perhaps wisely the statistics of the thirty six day battle in March 1945 are intentionally left out. They are grim of twenty two thousand defenders on Iwo Jima only 217 prisoners were taken the rest fell in battle or to suicide to avoid the humiliation of capture by the enemy. American casualties topped six thousand with another nineteen thousand wounded requiring the use of whole blood and plasma on a scale never utilized in combat before. Reflecting on those numbers is a totally inadequate exercise and virtually impossible to comprehend and yet this was a single battle field in the Pacific theater.If you care to learn more of this battle and the war in the Pacific an excellent resource is the documentary series Crusade In The Pacific utilizing film footage from cameramen on both sides of the War. One of the episodes deals with Bloody Iwo and the viewer will be stunned as I was to see how closely Eastwood's depiction of the landing invasion and ensuing battle resembles the real thing.

This is quite similar to All Quiet on the Western Front in how we are sympathetic to the principals.One is glued to the screen from EVERY scene. The 'reality' of the action is very strong and moving. We almost feel what it is like being Japanese.The sound quality is superb! When the bombs are falling from planes it is like being there having been a veteran myself.This movie should be nominated as best picture at the Acadmy Awards.

	onyx:emotionText "Usually we see American made films and they follow a certain pattern while foreign films seem to us being from 'left field.' This film was more foreign not because of sub titles and language but of HOW it was made. We are seeing the characters though eyes that we are not used to seeing from. This is quite similar to All Quiet on the Western Front in how we are sympathetic to the principals.One is glued to the screen from EVERY scene. The 'reality' of the action is very strong and moving. We almost feel what it is like being Japanese.The sound quality is superb! When the bombs are falling from planes it is like being there having been a veteran myself.This movie should be nominated as best picture at the Acadmy Awards. Clint Eastwood steps out of good into greatness in this effort.";

It has no natural water supply and covers just 8 square miles. Its capture was vital to the US war effort  however. It was one of the inner ring of islands protecting mainland Japan. It also lay almost halfway between the Japanese home island and the Marianas which had been occupied by US forces in mid1944. The island was defended by 21.000 Japanese. The commander  Major General Kuribayashi had worked hard to add to the natural defenses  especially around Mount Suribachi and in the North. He had built one of the most formidable defensive complexes of the war. It had miles of tunnels and trenches  hundred of underground emplacements antitank ditches and minifields. Kuribayashi knew that the garrison had no hope of any outside help and could not withdraw from the island. He ordered his men to fight and die in their trenches. They should kill as many enemy as possible using the network of tunnels to get destruction squads joining a squad meant almost certain death. Kuribayashi chose not to oppose the initial landings on the beaches. He would lure the US troops inland into the web of defensive positions in the interior. The US invasion was codenamed operation detachment. When US bombers began attacking was bombed every day in what was the longest and heaviest aerial bombardment of the whole Pacific war. The landings involved 800 warships manned by a total of 220.000 crew. About 110.000 troops were to take part in the initial assault of followon landings. The landings themselves were responsibility of three Marine Divisions under the command of Major General Harry Schmidt. US Marines took cover from Japanese fire on a beach of volcanic sand March 51945 and Mount Suribachi rises behind them. The island was declared secure on March 26 the 36 days of fighting had taken a terrible toll on both sides. Some 5.931 Marines had been killed and 17.372 wounded. There were also about 2.800 naval casualties. The precise number of Japanese dead is not known. Only 216 men surrendered during the fighting although another 900 or so surrendered later. The rest of the 21.000 troops died. The intensity of the fighting for Iwo Jima worried US commanders and politicians. The Japanese had been willing to die almost to a man to protect a tiny part of their homeland. They had inflicted severe losses on the US forces.".

It's not a matter of taking sides but what these soldiers were going through knowing that they were sure to have a strong chance of death or extreme injury. For a country where pride is extremely precious and if you come off as a coward you are a traitor to your land we realize the terror not only from where the Americans were standing but also the utter feeling of helplessness that the Japanese soldiers were feeling. Wanting to survive some feel that they may have to just swallow their pride while watching their best friends and family die in front of their eyes.Clint captured perfectly how every side has a story I am an American I have extreme pride for where I come from just like the Japanese did and still do. Both sides have extreme sympathy and hatred from the audience showing human emotions that everyone could relate too. This film has terrific acting beautifully disturbing scenery excellent sound and just a heart wrenching story that I guarantee if you enjoy history you will be very proud of this film.1010".

Must be a British thing.The whole business with the gangsters the Japanese and the poor innocent girl Coduri caught up in the middle of the mess helps the pot to boil to overflowing.  There are plenty of verbal gems within 'Five Wounds' for short! and one or two bits of visual humor that still bring a smile to my face.  I still chuckle when I think of how one of the sisters comes to suspect the new sisters aren't what they seem after going into the bathroom after one. Get the idea?  Good.Directorwriter Lynn has done better and worse but this is one to think of when it's a rainy day and you just want a good laugh that doesn't require TOO much thought.Eight stars for Nuns on the Run and remember Jesus is small green and split four ways.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robbie Coltrane and Eric Idle are Nuns on the Run in this 1990 British comedy also starring Janet Suzman and Camille Coduri. Coltrane and Idle play Charlie and Brian who commit robberies for the big boss whose cover is a health club. Unfortunately they become personae non grata when one of their colleagues who wants out tells the boss that Charlie and Brian want out too. That colleague later winds up dead. With their boss no longer trusting them they are ordered to rob drug money from a dangerous group called The Trinity  but the boss has ordered his other associates to kill them. Charlie and Brian meanwhile have decided to rob the drug lord all right keep the money for themselves and escape to Rio. When they arrive at the scene their wouldbe killers are already there. Tipped off by Brian's girlfriend they turn the tables on the assassins grab the money and run inside the nearest open doorway which turns out to be a convent. They dress in nun's clothes buy some makeup and become nuns. Nuns who always carry black briefcases.This is a very entertaining if often low comedy with good performances. Idle is funny as the lovesick Brian whose girlfriend Faith Coduri keeps losing her glasses and can't see anything. The beautiful Coduri is a riot doing a sort of Marilyn Monroe in How to Marry a Millionaire by constantly walking into things. Coltrane plays the more pragmatic tougher Charlie who can't help going into the girls' shower after teaching gym. He is also the one who really gets into the whole religious thing being Catholic himself. I think God is going to get us out of this he announces. Janet Suzman does a good job as the Mother Superior who finds the new nuns odd to say the least. But she has some other problems one of which is dealing with an older alcoholic compulsive gambler nun who stole 50000 pounds from the drug rehabilitation program run by the sisters.If you're Catholic you'll get a kick out of this film or hate it. I myself thought Charlie trying to teach Brian about the Holy Trinity was a scream as was Brian totally botching it when repeating it to his students. Also funny was Charlie teaching Brian the sign of the cross and genuflecting. When Faith goes to confession afraid she'll say something she shouldn't Brian replaces the priest and Charlie has to whisper the absolution in his ear which Brian messes up. I resolve you  no I absolve you of your sins... Definitely recommended.".

POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADActually I'm not sure what you'd do a sequel about that could keep the pace of the first film plus be original. The storyline of Nuns On The Run isn't itself unique as there have been other films where someone is on the lam doing their best to 'blend in'. The thing that sets this film apart is the humour especially Eric Idle trying to teach a roomful of girls about the Trinity God is like a shamrock small green and split three ways. I'm not Catholic so I hope nobody took offense to that but it was hilarious. Of course the gratuitous shower scene was an interesting twist but nonetheless it was another embarrassing situation for the two blokes to muck through.This movie wasn't a huge box office draw but does that really matter?".

Now I was only really familiar with the likes of The Benny Hill Show and not with much else English. My cousin might as well have been a rockstar he was into heavy metal and had no care or ties to class or culture. At any rate we went and agreed on this in sort of a 'flip' manner. When the previews ended I forgot what we came to see so did Dave but just shortly after starting the story was infectious!! We both laughed and laughed all the way through. These two Englishmen Idle and Coltrane and a cast that I had never seen before just lit up. The music was a delightful companion to the movie. I know that usually with comedy in a certain culture you might get it or you might not if you are not from that country or culture. So with that I realized that I wouldn't catch it all. But instead of feeling like an outsider I felt as though I was together on the same side as these two mob conmen in a story of nun 'Hammery' . What a nice surprise! My cousin was on it too which kind of shocked me . All in all it was as if this movie didn't miss a single trick the ending was a perfect wrapup for Charlie and Brian bringing along Faith for good measure on a wide body 747!! And dressed for the job as airline stewardesses !!! Coffee tea or peanuts?! This is a tenstar comedic bash of a good time! I recommend this classic to those who love English comedy. This is a real untarnished getaway English mob flick with a little Catholic confusion at confession time and mayhem along the way thrown in for good measure. What a comedy teamup these two Eric and Robbie!! George Harrison was the one that enabled this to be made I couldn't believe it that good ole shy former Beatle thanks again George.The rest of the cast was smashing as well. Good show".

They have the chemistry that make any unusual situation a real hoot.  An odd couple in a strange situation isn't always enough i.e. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito in Twins 1988. It takes a natural timing that Eric and Robbie have developed over many years in the comedy business. Once you let yourself start laughing with this film its hard to stop. Its a great video selection you can enjoy again and again. Watch for the subtle stuff or just play it in the background for an occasional chuckle when family arrives for the holidays.  I'd rate it an 8 at least.".

Personally I think it is more like those movies where we laugh at men in dresses and characters pretending to be something else. In fact this style of comedy comes from Shakespeare's As You Like It which is turn came from a completely different play.What we have with these plots is that somebody must disguise themselves as somebody else and in that new persona they start to do things that they normally wouldn't do. Okay sitting in a shower full of naked women would not be possible unless the man was one of those men and even then it would be very difficult to do but disguised as a woman then it is entirely possible.Also in these new persona's they are able to impact on people in an entirely different way and at times spout many words of wisdom. In the end though their farce has been uncovered and they are generally distrusted and disliked. All movies with the exception of Some Like It Hot in which somebody takes the role of another person has a scene where they are ostracised and distrusted.Personally I did find this movie enjoyable. It is not exactly a good movie but it is enjoyable and I would recommend people to watch it simply for the farce that it creates.

It's energetic breezy snappy stuff with some great lines some gentle digs at Catholicism and spirited performances especially from stars Eric Idle and Robbie Coltrane. Produced by George Harrison's Handmade Films company it follows Idle as Brian and Coltrane as Charlie two small time criminals sick and tired of working for a thuggish young boss Case Casey Robert Patterson. They learn that their boss plans on stealing money from the Triads so Brian and Charlie decide to purloin the money for themselves. They make a mess of the job and end up being forced to hide in a convent where they have to pass themselves off as nuns  Sister Inviolata of the Immaculate Conception and Sister Euphemia of the Five Wounds Five Wounds for short. What follows is predictable enough but still entertaining farce as Brian and Charlie go about their nuns' duties while the mobsters they double crossed try to track them down and Brians' love interest Faith the adorable Camille Coduri does the same. The film overall doesn't work as well when the focus is off Brian and Charlie but it still entertains solidly and agreeably for its 93 minute duration. It gets off to a very bright start ends up sagging a little but ultimately gets back on track with a wonderfully lively finish. The best thing about it is a sterling pair of performances by the well cast likable leads the supporting cast are no slouches though with Janet Suzman as the Sister Superior Lila Kaye as Sister Mary of the Annunciation and the hilarious Doris Hare as Sister Mary of the Sacred Heart. There isn't much violence and what little there is is played for laughs although viewers might be surprised to see some topless shots from the comely young students at the convent. Among the highlights are Charlie's take on sinning and religion as he explains it to a horn dog priest Father Seamus Tom Hickey his basketball game with the girls and Brian's predicament as he attempts to visit Faith while still trying to pull the wool over the real nuns' eyes. Punctuated by a typically amusing score by the group Yello those guys who will likely always be best remembered for their Oh Yeah tune Nuns on the Run is a good fun flick from start to finish and it comes up with a fine punchline at the end. Seven out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is nothing more reliable than Eastwood behind the camera with his assured touch his films are never boring or deliberately confusing hiding technical devices or special effects that detract from the most important part of movie making a good screenplay a good story good acting. For the past 10 years many films have been unduly praised because they have one or two great performances unfairly leaving many good and deserving movies without the recognition they deserved. Eastwood has however given us the whole package time after time with movies as varied as Mystic River Letters Million Dollar Baby and now Changeling. True there is a link they are all strong films with themes that deal with pain and loss but the stories are different the settings require an amazing attention to detail what they all share is a strong focus and interestingly enough superb performances.Eastwood has paved the way to acting honors for Penn Freeman Swank Hackman and others that were continuously ignored by the Academy. There is no denying the power of their performances in Eastwood's movies and that leads to the center of this film Jolie. I read recently that her performance has been attacked as being affected and the attempt of a star to look normal. Putting aside those silly and biased remarks let's state something clearly the lady has given us a fantastic tour de force proving that she can be both a star when looking at the other cameras but that when she is working for a director she gives her best regardless of what our perception of her private life might be. If you are a critic with a personal disapproval of that persona keep it to yourself concentrate on the film and the work of the performer.As the mother who desperately wants the truth about her child Angelina is flawless. We can read the pain in her eyes the determination and the disturbing reality that her obsession might be having unexpected results but one thing is clear there is a drive that won't quit and it's admirable for those of us who want her to be reunited with her child and it's quite inconvenient for the people who have other interests at hand.Her battle with the folks at LAPD is of epic proportions and it is amazing that she held on to her goal of exposing the corruption that she encountered as she searched for her missing boy. There are some horrific moments in the film as we relieve some of the injustices and Gothic horror of places like the hospital in this film. There are also some background scene that might or not reveal what really happen. There are moments when one is a bit exhausted from all the information the film delivers but every moment is worth it. It is all framed with an expert hand and it is anchored by the very powerful work by Jolie and the rest of an amazing cast that brings to life emotions such as madness anger pain sorrow and many times disbelief that humans can be capable of such terrible actions.The film contains amazing production values as we are taken back to an era that doesn't exist anymore. The recreation of the time Los Angeles was on its way to being a real city is incredible as we see it before it fell apart and spread all over a gigantic geographical area losing its identity. The musical score is a sweet melody that hints at the love and pain themes in the film and there are some moments bound to become classic as children tell the stories that adults might not want to face or believe.All in all Changeling may be very difficult to sit through but it is not less impressive effective or good than any of the last five films Eastwood has made. As a matter of fact it's just one masterpiece from the man who could teach Hollywood a few lessons.".

The story involves a parent's worst nightmare so I would expect moms and dads to be particularly horrified. The movie manipulates no doubt being overdone here and there but it's generally effective.Angelina Jolie does a superb job of portraying a Los Angeles woman Christine Collins in the late 1920s whose boy is kidnapped. Five months later the proud police department brings her kid back making it a good PR session. Unfortunately it's not her kid and stupidly although she's naturally upset about she poses with the kid and takes him home. Would that really happen?. Then she begins her quest of finding her real Walter. Further twists and turns make the story increasingly horrifying. In all you won't be able to keep your eyes off the screen wondering if justice will ever prevail in the end and who exactly is involved in what. It's not particularly a fun ride  you'll have a frown on your face for quite some time  but it sure is interesting and an excellent two hourplus of entertainment. By the end you'll be emotionally exhausted.Kudos to all the actors in here for riveting performances and to the production and design team for a great period piece. Where else can you feel you're back 7580 years in time with the boxy cars and flapper hats than in movies?".

	schema:reviewBody "Changeling  In 1928 Single mother Christine Collins Angelina Jolie returns home one day to discover her nineyearold son Walter is missing. She calls the police and after enduring a grueling 24 hours they search for her son. But the boy they return to her is not her son. After confronting corrupt city authorities Collins is vilified as an unfit mother and sent to an asylum.This is a grueling film to watch. I have not felt this hideous since North Country a film which also dealt with misogyny within the power structure. Women are treated as fragile emotional and not believable. This film tackles corruption to boot as the LAPD is accused of being a gang of thugs that answer to no one. Eastwood is old school with the violence understanding that the mind can fill in the very brutal gaps.Angelina Jolie delivers another great performance. But unlike A Mighty Heart this film actually deserves her presence. I don't think she really should have so much press coverage but there is definitely reason for her acclaim as an actress. The situation her character goes through is so surreal and the film captures it perfectly. It gives you chills from the second Christine is given this pretender to raise and rarely lets up. And if for one moment you tell yourself It's just a movie as I tried to this s actually happened. Characters were composited or changed a disclaimer at the end states but the events were the same.An odd praise goes out to Jason Butler Harner who plays Gordon Northcott a kidnapper and murderer of many children. He has played one of the monsters of everyone's nightmares to perfection. Also of note is Jeffrey Donovan for his portrayal of J. J. Jones corruption personified. Jones is a man able to whisk people away to asylums with no need of warrants. Scary indeed.Changeling shares a theme with several of Clint Eastwood's other films. Unforgiven and Flags of Our Fathers come most readily to mind. His lesson concerns truth and lies and exposing the hypocrisy of falsehoods for want of the truth. The truth is rarely pretty but generally preferable to lies and will often come to surface if given enough time. I doubt I will watch this struggle for truth for a long time to come it's not one for casual viewing but it's a very good film.A".

	schema:reviewBody "Changeling is the new film from director Clint Eastwood. It is based on a true story that takes place in 1928 L.A.The story is about a woman who returns home one day to find her son missing. Then a few months later the police return a child to her but it isn't her son. The woman keeps on telling everyone that this child isn't her son but the police keep on claiming that it is her son and are calling the woman crazy.The film is a wonderful study about police corruption in L.A. in the late 1920s. The film is emotionally gripping and at times disturbing.The film was superbly directed by Clint Eastwood who was working from a terrific script by J. Michael Straczynski. Not only that but Eastwood also wrote the film's score which was very good as well. Of course the acting is what truly stole the show for me. Angelina Jolie delivers an Oscar worthy performance as the mother of the missing child but what truly surprised me was how good these children in the cast were. All of the child actors were very well cast and all delivered amazing performances.As a whole Eastwood's Changeling is one of the best films of the year and should be up for some bigtime Oscars at year's end.A perfect 10 out of 10!".

And I won't forget the magic behind the camera provided by the genius Clint Eastwood.Angelina's character is terrific and she fights what seems to be at first a lost fight for her son in a world controlled by men. You learn to hate some characters in the movie and love others. You learn to feel for Angelina's character and hope the movie ends well. Changeling will make you cry and when you walk out of the theater after this fantastic film you feel both good and satisfied.Angelina was so good and convincing in this movie that I could not believe my own eyes and ears. And John Malkovich was very good too but Angelina is the rock of this movie. She carries it on her shoulders and Clint Eastwood directs her like...like...I don't know what to write anymore I'm still calming down.

	schema:reviewBody "Clint Eastwood's newest project Changeling is sort of awesome sort of annoying. The true story of Christine Collins a telephone operator and single mother in 1928 Los Angeles has a promising script and cast but fails to accomplish any major feats on screen. At times the dialog feels forced. For example when Jolie adds an ambient Sport moniker or makes references to Cleopatra. It's as if Eastwood is saying to the audience Yes this really is 1928 I promise. Historical accuracy is important in a film claiming truth but Changeling is a bit like scaling a wall there is not much to hold on to.But what little there is to hold on to is both enjoyable and sophisticated. Angelina Jolie who plays Christine gives a convincing portrayal of a mother who returns home from work to find that her son Walter is missing. In fact Jolie might have scored a career best performance with Changeling but it is hard to say whether or not this is enough to carry the film.Jolie holds her head high as a mother who loses her son and receives little help from the Los Angeles Police Department during the search. The 1920s were wrought with scandal for the L.A.P.D. and Christine Collins find herself in the midst of them. After months of search the police return Walter to Christine only to find that she denies that he is her son. Despite the mounting evidence supporting her claim her Walter is uncircumcised the new Walter is not the new Walter is 3 inches shorter etc. the police continually deny that there is anything wrong. Because of the recent scandals the L.A.P.D does not want to admit any wrongdoing with the Collins case.The tone of this story seems to border between overthetop melodrama and a deadon homage to 1930s dramatic style. This is most notable in the scenes featuring Captain J.J. Jones Jeffrey Donovan whose performance is cookiecutter bad cop for the period. Eastwood navigates the bad cops with ease and never allows them to become satire but it borders on the edge. Likewise with the necessary court scenes in the latter portion Eastwood makes the material work even if just barely. It is hard to diminish the negative affects of these melodramatic choices but then again it is a story about true events. Who am I to say whether or not the courtroom proceedings actually had that much fervor and zest? It is hard to find fault in conceivable truth.Another strong performance in the film comes from John Malkovich as Reverend Gustav Briegleb a man determined to expose the misdeeds of the Los Angeles Police Department via his radio show. Briegleb vows to help Christine in her quest for her son as he believes that Walter is not the same boy. Malkovich gives a convincing role as a man of God a man of principle and a man of determination. He plays the hero but never saddles up his white horse. His heroics come naturally as a man who wants the best for his city and the people within it his mission is never glitzy never selfindulgent.Malkovich and Jolie together save the one part of the film that could have poisoned the entire piece. When Miss Collins refuses to be quiet on the issue of her son and is convinced by Briegleb to go public with the misdoings of the police she is whisked off to a mental ward. Until she admits that she is making the whole impostorson bit up she will remain in the ward. The mental ward scenes were in complete discord with the rest of the film. The inclusion of stereotypical elements like electroshock therapy and evil nurses allowed these scenes to toe the line of ridiculousness. If it were not for a convincing and levelheaded performance from Jolie nothing good would have come from these scenes. And when Malkovich's character swoops in to save her from the grips of the ward and the police it never once feels trite. Eastwood should really thank these two and consider the possibility of never ever filming any hospitallike scenes ever again.The unsaturated color choice for the film gives an immediate feeling of doom and sadness for the picture but a more upbeat stylized look might have complimented the film better. The cinematography attempted to mirror the motif of the film but ended up missing the mark and falling more into dark and muddled than stylistically relevant.With the film clocking in a 140 minutes it is impressive that it never feels that long. Eastwood navigates through a significant chunk of time with little duress and manages to take on a troubling story without being all too troubling. Easily an audience favorite and definite Oscarbait as the United States release is set for November under the title The Exchange. This film is mass of inbetweens. It is neither complex nor simple neither heartfelt nor underwhelming. I find it hard to love it but I do not hate it either. That's the problem nothing clicks. It is within this realm that I find this film more than anything else a tad bit frustrating. It is a virtuous attempt and no doubt going to do well both in box office numbers and with awards. But because of that I wanted more punch. I wanted more zing more attitude. The film melts quickly in my mind and becomes just another biopic that might soon be forgotten. A little originality is crucial especially for a film being considered for the Cannes Film Festival's highest honor. This film leaves me generally satisfied all whist thinking Come on Clint. You could've done better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Clint Eastwood is one of the legends of the silver screen from his humble beginnings as the Man With No Name in Sergio Leone westerns to Dirty Harry the kickbutt cop. As a director he has given us some of the finest stories we could ever see including the Oscarwinning Unforgiven Million Dollar Baby and the war epic twins Flags of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima. With his new film he explores the dark side of the earlier part of the twentieth century in Tinseltown Los Angeles. Taken from true events the story unfolds that a single mother Christine Collins has lost her nineyear old son Walter. She asks the LAPD to intervene and about two months later her son is returned. Then she says it isn't her son. She never looks back.From the moment the young boy steps off the train Christine insists to everyone that he is not her son. Unfortunately the police say she is delusional and just upset. The films leads to the truth of the matter which is that the corruption in the department has led to them being lackadaisical in their duties. The story moves along fluidly yet we are never really told the reason that corruption resides.Nevertheless the film is quite an experience. It looks terrific and really feels like the 1920s in Los Angeles. Angelina Jolie is solid as Christine yet I felt she seemed more whiny at times than desperate. It just didn't move me as strongly as Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby. The supporting cast is good as well especially John Malkovich as the pastor eager to help Christine in the fight against the LAPD. What I really wanted was that emotional pull that Eastwood's other films had. This one seemed a bit cold and ruthless despite that being its subject material. So I would say to go and see it it is definitely worth the 140 minutes. As for Oscar time I can't say for sure that it will wrap up the big ones such as Best Picture Director or Actress. It wasn't the strongest campaign I've seen but then again this has been a weaker year than 2007.".

	schema:headline " Clint Eastwood Can't Make A Bad Movie Even If He Tried";
	schema:reviewBody "With Changeling Clint Eastwood has yet to end his streak of auspicious film making. Though not one of his best it is certainly worth watching. Changeling is a film about a single mother's Christine search for her son with a twist. Rather than the LAPD trying to help her they oppose her. As a result of receiving bad publicity for being unable to find her son Walter after five months the police deliver Christine her son. He is not really her son he is a fraud. Christine immediately recognizes the boy isn't her son and quickly points this out to the police. She realizes she now has to fight the LAPD in order to find out the truth about her son. But with her attempt to fight back and embarrass the LAPD comes intense consequences. The acting was rather disappointing in some aspects. For example Jeffrey Donovan was a bit annoying in his role as Captain Jones. His role required him to have some sort of a powerful aura with an intimidation power. Yet to me he was average bringing nothing to the movie not properly portraying a selfish unjust policeman. The star of the movie Angelina Jolie was very solid but her performance was not a unique or impossible one to take on by any other actress. She did what she had to do to make the movie a success but she certainly did not take the movie to another level. The one actor that did impress me though was John Malkovich which probably shouldn't be a surprise who i felt should have received more screen time. Unlike Jolie he took the movie to another level. A more serious suspenseful and intensified level that carried a heightened sense of depth which was was badly missing from a few performances such as Jeffrey Donovan throughout the film. Overall the performances throughout were inconsistent. The writing and director of the movie was done very well but it could've used a little more sharpness. At times the movie seemed to be all over place not quite having an identity. Sometimes it was a crime mystery sometimes a drama and sometimes it tried too hard to be both. Despite that Clint Eastwood some how keeps Changeling from dramatically falling apart. It almost seems as if Clint Eastwood couldn't make a bad movie even if he tried. At times it flourished and at other times it just didn't feel right. Christine Collins always told her son You never start a fight but you always finish it. Eastwoods job on this movies seemed quite the contrary he never quite finished the movie off. My rating 7.710".

	schema:reviewBody "Clint Eastwood the master of making depressing films now makes his trilogy Mystic River Million Dollar Baby and now Changeling. Based of the horrific chicken coop murders from the 1920's in California we get a deeper insight into one of the mothers of the victims Christine Collins who is portrayed by Angelina Jolie queen of the never ending tears. I'm just playing she does a terrific job and is just so heart breaking to watch her story on film she gives Christine a lot of character and depth. The film is even made a certain way a lot of dark colors it seems as if it was made in old Hollywood which was a very intelligent way of setting the mood and time of the film. We have some very fine performances pretty much from everyone in this movie. The one flaw I did feel is that the script does have some lines that are a little over done a little too dramatic but it really works for the film and story.Christine Collins is a single mother in the 1920's she's a strong woman who is even ahead of some of the men in her line of work as an operator manager. But she's so busy with work that she tries to make time with her son Walter. One day they are going to go to the movies but Christine has to go to work she says she'll meet Walter right back at home she's late of course and when she gets home Walter is missing. She calls the police but they say she has to wait 24 hours. After a few months the police tell her they've found her son she couldn't be happier... that is until she sees a boy who is not her son. But the police will not fess up and admit they messed up so instead of helping Christine they treat her horribly and throw in her in an insane asylum and quite looking for her son but the town's Rev. Gustav Briegleb will not give up and expose the police for the horrible people they are and will do anything to help Christine find her son.Changeling is a great film one of the best of 2008 you know this is going to be a big contender for Oscar season. I really enjoyed this film I have to admit it had me in tears all that this poor woman went through to find her son the pain and mental mind well you know the f word that the police put her through I felt so horrible for her. Jeffrey Donovan just plays the ultimate jerk who just keeps playing gaslight on Christine Collins forcing a child who is not her son down her throat. Although I think this film could have been a good comedy if they gave her an Asian baby or something and try to convince her then that that's her son lol OK that was so bad sorry. But seriously this is a great film I do highly recommend that you take the chance to see it in the theater if you can.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "'Changeling' has a lot going for it in the eyes of the public just being directed by Clint and starring Angelina. Moreover the littleknown but true LA story it tells is heartrending. A hardworking single mother in 1928 Christine Collins Jolie is forced to work on Saturday in her job as an assistant supervisor at Pacific Telephone and she leaves her young son Walter Gattlin Griffith at home. When she comes back he's gone. Five months later the police produce her son found in another stateonly she denies it's her son. The LAPD's reputation is on the line and they force Christine to take the boy home. Then they try to discredit her as a lazy and unfit mother when she keeps insisting the kid isn't hers. Eventually she tangles more and more with the LAPD who're going through an especially lawless period under a corrupt chief. They've shot down a lot of criminals in cold blood and swept away the bodiesjust so the Force can control all the crooked dealings in town. Their archenemy and leader of the public outcry against cop corruption is crusading minister Rev. Gustav Briegleb John Malkovich who seizes upon the Collins case when it becomes public smelling a rat. After Collins has repeatedly opposed the cops and refused to accept the boy delivered to herwho's three inches too short and circumcised has different dental work and is unrecognized by his schoolteachera willful Irish Captain assigned to this case Jeffrey Donovan orders her locked away in a psych ward. A lurid story of child abductions emerges.'Changeling' in the screenplay written by J. Michael Straczynski is based on contemporary press accounts of what are called the Wineville Chicken Murders. The mystery of Walter Collins' disappearance vies with the story of police corruption and the secret of the murders for attention but Strazzynski wisely tells the tale from the viewpoint of Collins' mother a kind of feminist heroine since at a time when women tended to keep their mouths shut she will not be silenced and never gives up. Some of the more gruesome details of the Wineville story are omitted but sequences that go there still have a horror movie cast to them. The rest is a thrillercumpolice procedural with distinct period sociological elements. But there is skillful handling in the way a farreaching story begins and ends with the intimate experience of a bereaved mother.Eastwood seems to have looked for a story on the order of Fincher's even lengthier 'Zodiac' but the melodrama and focus on copcrime in the material relate it to the James Ellroybased films 'L.A. Confidential' and 'The Black Dahlia.' The psychward incarceration sequence takes you straight back to Samuel Fuller's 'Shock Corridor'at which point things are beginning to seem pretty lurid and the film almost as manipulative as Fuller's. Nonetheless the style has Eastwood's usual current elegance and clarity. Oxymoron it may seem but this is lurid yet mostly restrained. After all this is a tale in which manipulation is being consciously looked at. In an interview at the NYFF Eastwood pointed out that there was a link with movies like 'Gaslight' that deal with people trying to bend the minds of others this is what the crooked cops try to force on Catherine and they win to the extent that she takes the other boy home. And this is the most interesting and unusual aspect of the story.The acting is confident if varied. There are a bunch of young boys who turn in strong convincing performances and as manipulative police captain and his chief Jeffrey Donovan and Colm Feore are reasonable and Michael Kelley appealing as the good cop who unearths the kidnappings. Newcomer Jason Butler Harner gives a distinctive performance as the wiggedout killer Gordon Northcott. Amy Ryan is typically strong as another victim of the cops' psych ward incarceration scam. Less successful is John Malkovich in Marcelled wig as the crusading religionist Rev.Briegleb he just seems too mannered and creepy. Jolie is good though her appearance is a bit strange that huge mouth goes oddly with 20's hair styles. At one moment after she was out of the psych ward I thought she might be locked up a second timefor overacting. Harner gets his chance to chew up the rug himself in his final scene. A little holding back would not have hurt.The film is outstanding in its period look and good if not perfect in its period feel. If nothing else you'll remember Catherine Collins quaintly gong back and forth along the lone line of phone operators she superviseson roller skates. Whole neighborhoods were restored by the filmmakers and streets filled with Model T's and best of all old trolley cars. The attempt at period lingo might have been more consistent but that's a goal rarely achieved. Since the time scheme runs from 1928 to 1935 more mention of the Great Depression surely would also have been in order. Since the screenplay sticks to known facts there is nothing about Jolie's character before or after the events. This is a good and watchable film but not up to Eastwood's terrific 2003 2004 and 2006 efforts. Presented as the midpoint film of the New York Film Festival already wellpublicized at Cannes 'Changeling' opens nationwide October 31st. Eastwood has already directed two more films one of which 'Gran Torino' he stars in. Even at 78 the man still seems virtually unstoppable.".

This is the actor who plays the characters that I LOVE to despise. His character in Hitch Bait and Changeling I despise. I just want him to lose. I want him to die. I just wanted Captain J.J Jones to suffer for his controlling and manipulative attitude. He put the mother through a terrible ordeal for his own selfish gain. I was so glad to see him lose his role as an officer for life and gain punishment! I despised him from the start right to the end!I would recommend it to people to film lovers. For it is a film you will either get bored and turn it off or really allow it to take it's time to unfold and that's where you will find the joy in watching this wonderful film. This movie was fantastic. The way it was constructed flowed and created. It had the Eastwood directing touch and the colour of a sepiablack and white contrast added to the wonderful tone of the film. The actors were perfectly cast in their roles as they all brought depth and emotion to the characters. Overall such a great film that I would remember for a long time!".

	schema:headline " A tale of abuse and corruption";
	schema:reviewBody "It's ironic that because of the 1950s TV drama Dragnet Los Angeles got the reputation of being a city with a squeaky clean incorruptible police department. It's ironic because nothing could be further from the truth for much of the city's history.The 1920s and most of the thirties were particularly lawless decades for LA cops. LA was overflowing with gambling houses and bordellos all operating virtually openly. Cops were involved in one scandal after another including a police chief caught during Prohibition in the back seat of a police car with a bottle of booze and a half naked hooker vice squad cops caught up in a badger game targeting a city councilman and the commander of the police intelligence division convicted of attempted murder in the bombing of the car of a special investigator for the grand jury looking into police corruption.One of the hardest incidents to comprehend was the 1928 disappearance of 9yearold Walter Collins and his return five months later thanks to the detective work of the LAPD. That was a case that might have been completely forgotten by now but for one thing  the boy's incredulous mother who took one look at the returning kid and said That's not my son! What could have prompted the LAPD to substitute another kid for the missing boy? Awash in a constant stream of bad publicity targeted by reformers and plagued by the fact that it was a department of thieves thugs and incompetents the 1928 department under Chief James Two Guns Davis was apparently desperate for any good publicity and returning a missing kid to his hard working single mom seemed full proof. But for one thing Mom was tougher than Davis and conducted a non stop crusade to uncover the truth and find her real son.Sadly unfolding at the same time was the repugnant tale of a serial killer operating out of a chicken ranch in nearby Riverside county and how he was abducting and murdering young boys.All these elements the Collins case the police corruption story and the tale of the serial killer  are expertly woven together by director Clint Eastwood into a movie that grows more interesting as it goes.Expertly cast and beautifully mounted the art direction is a shoe in for an Oscar nominationthe film nonetheless lives or dies on the performance of Angelina Jolie who plays the mom Christine Collins. Many of Jolie's roles don't do much to test her acting chops this one does and she more than meets the challenge turning in a beautifully controlled performance that should get her another Oscar nod too.If I have a criticism it is that the movie in the end gives the impression the corruption may have ended when Chief Davis was demoted following the Collins case. He was demoted to head of the traffic division but was made Chief again when Frank Shaw became mayor.Corruption at city hall and in the police department simply exploded and there were so many abuses by the central vice squad the Intelligence Division and the Red Squad of strike breakers and gun thugs that they eventually led to the 1938 recall of Mayor Shaw and a general house cleaning of the police department which forced out Davis and more than 40 other high ranking officers.But see the movie. This one is certainly worth seeing.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's ironic that because of the 1950s TV drama Dragnet Los Angeles got the reputation of being a city with a squeaky clean incorruptible police department. It's ironic because nothing could be further from the truth for much of the city's history.The 1920s and most of the thirties were particularly lawless decades for LA cops. LA was overflowing with gambling houses and bordellos all operating virtually openly. Cops were involved in one scandal after another including a police chief caught during Prohibition in the back seat of a police car with a bottle of booze and a half naked hooker vice squad cops caught up in a badger game targeting a city councilman and the commander of the police intelligence division convicted of attempted murder in the bombing of the car of a special investigator for the grand jury looking into police corruption.One of the hardest incidents to comprehend was the 1928 disappearance of 9yearold Walter Collins and his return five months later thanks to the detective work of the LAPD. That was a case that might have been completely forgotten by now but for one thing  the boy's incredulous mother who took one look at the returning kid and said That's not my son! What could have prompted the LAPD to substitute another kid for the missing boy? Awash in a constant stream of bad publicity targeted by reformers and plagued by the fact that it was a department of thieves thugs and incompetents the 1928 department under Chief James Two Guns Davis was apparently desperate for any good publicity and returning a missing kid to his hard working single mom seemed full proof. But for one thing Mom was tougher than Davis and conducted a non stop crusade to uncover the truth and find her real son.Sadly unfolding at the same time was the repugnant tale of a serial killer operating out of a chicken ranch in nearby Riverside county and how he was abducting and murdering young boys.All these elements the Collins case the police corruption story and the tale of the serial killer  are expertly woven together by director Clint Eastwood into a movie that grows more interesting as it goes.Expertly cast and beautifully mounted the art direction is a shoe in for an Oscar nominationthe film nonetheless lives or dies on the performance of Angelina Jolie who plays the mom Christine Collins.

	schema:reviewBody "I liked this movie less and less the longer it went on. Eastwood is an interesting director but his biggest fault lies in his inability to see the woods for the trees. Like the latterday Spielberg he just can't bear to end the movie or at least cut out scenes which stretch the patience. There are long tedious swathes of this movie the hearings at the end the trial of the killer which could have been drastically edited or in the case of the outcome of the hearings cut completely and dealt with in text at the end of the movie or in a far more succinct denouement.Conversely there are parts of the story dealt with so briefly that they are simply confusing. The reason why a small boy would pretend to be a missing child how he got the idea and who encouraged him are inadequately provided and the solitary scene of the boy being left as collateral in a diner is scant compensation.It's a testament to the slightly unfocused film that I felt it necessary to read more about the real case online when I got home just to fill in the gaps. In my etravels I found an interview with the screenwriter who says he didn't want to glorify the heinous crimes which formed part of the story but wanted to focus on the personal tale of Christine Collins and her disappeared son. That's all very well but it was only really in the scenes involving the crimes that the film really felt alive and driven instead of melodramatic and pedantic. If I had to see Angelina Jolie slap her heart and shout 'I want MY son!' one more time I'd had have wanted a refund. Or earplugs.Jolie has had loads of plaudits for her role and she was good  but I found her lips so distracting that I can hardly judge. Against a muted 'period' palette her scarlet protuberances  often in the act of griefinduced quivering  intrude like two giant red jellies in a pot of porridge.This is not a bad film  parts of it are very good and some of it is shocking. But someone needs to let Clint Eastwood know the line between drama and melodrama taking time and tedium and attention to detail and pedantry.I would have given it a 6 but I'm giving it a 5 in an effort to drag the ridiculously high score down to a sensible level as quickly as possible.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the first movie I've seen starring Angelina Jolie the only other movie I've seen her in is 'Beowulf' which doesn't really provide much to compare and I think that enabled me to see this film without any ingrained expectations or prejudices because I didn't really know what to expect from Jolie or Eastwood.In saying that I thoroughly enjoyed this film and even as it leant towards the three hour mark I really didn't want it to end because besides being fiercely involved in the film I still harboured an idealistic hope that all would be well. I think that even though it was indeed a very dark and bleak film it wasn't one which outstayed it's welcome by becoming tediously gloomy because besides handling the subject matter in a fashion that didn't become completely suffocating it also compensated the darkness with a grimly bittersweet conclusion and a somewhat hopeful outlook on humanity as not being 'all bad'. In other words the film delves deeply into the very worst aspects of human action and feeling before eventually resolving to the better more compassionate aspects to leave us with the view that while some people are terrible there are good people and there is hope. As Jolie's character Christine Collins puts it in the last minutes of the film.I felt that some of the aspects of this film were so horrific and graphic that they almost touched on Horror in a way. In that way because some of the subject matter was so gruesome and confronting it did make it almost unbelievable. After seeing an emotionally charged dramatic deeply intense movie like Revolutionary Road and then seeing Changeling I found that while the subject matter in Changeling was somewhat more horrible it didn't affect me so much or discomfort me as much. Mostly I think because the events were beyond what we expect to be confronted with in a civilised society the murder of innocent children a police force which condones violence and terror the abuse of a mother at her most vulnerable are all things we find almost too horrific to believe and are ones we can't really relate to unless we've been in a similar circumstance which I hope is not the case.In saying that the emotion was very real. The tension and unease were beautifully used to keep the audience on tenterhooks throughout the movie always hoping that just around the corner would be Walter Collins because we follow Christine through so much pain fear and anguish. Despite this film's subject matter I did enjoy it and that's not something you can often say about a film containing these sorts of events. The ending message while certainly not a Hollywood happy ending was one which really finished off a brilliant movie on a bittersweet hopeful tone but one which does not attempt to undo the horrors which unfold in this very unique and enthralling film. Jolie by the way was brilliant and I certainly will be keeping an eye out for her in the future to see if she can perform this well again.".

Taking the film at face value this was a convincing depiction of preDepression America with some great details  the rollerskating supervising in the telephone company by Angeline Jolie's Caroline Collins character in particular was a neat perioddefining touch whilst good use is made of exterior locations at psychopathic murderer Northcott's chickencoop location the train station where Jolie is reunited with her supposed son and the recreation of her suburban neighbourhood equally with the interiors at the grisly psychiatric hospital where Jolie is incarcerated as well as the courtroom police station and even the inside of Jolie's house. Atmosphere and realism are inset from the outset.The story almost unbelievable in its premise but bolstered by the based on a true story legend over the opening titles I'll research its claim later! makes for tense and at times unbearable viewing as Jolie's Kafkatype nightmare almost fully envelops her and only comes into the light with the aid of an anticorruption radio evangelist preacher and a cop who finally does his job right and actually listens to the crucial witness testimony of Northcott's unwilling teenage accomplice.The film however suffers a bit from being overlong in places symptomatic of Eastwood's typical slowpaced style and there appear to be three or four endings tagged on one after the other each good enough in itself to close the film before the credits roll. I also didn't feel the dualtrial scenes worked together Eastwood possibly posting the question about just who the bigger villains actually were here the psychopathic killer who completely believes in Jolie or the backcovering inhumanity of the Chief of Police and his chief officer who think nothing of foisting an impostor on a traumatised mother and then unbelievably throw her into a ruthlessly run psychiatric hospital to hush her protests. The acting is of a high standard. Early on I did find Jolie a bit showy in her performance but she learns the less is more maxim as the film progresses particularly as she descends into the bedlam of her psychiatric treatment where she witnesses and suffers almost inhuman cruelty and deprivation before her release which sees her thenceforward display a telling stoic dignity in her pursuit of the truth. It's very much her film although the support is strong in almost every other part too.Eastwood is now very settled in his style and any viewer knows they're not going to be jolted out of their seat by anything put in their way. His skill is in storytelling and here again with the aid of fine cinematography and an effective soundtrack of his own composition he delivers a shocking story in a credible and persuasive way to keep you rooted most of the time anyway in your seat for its 160 minute duration.".

Early on I did find Jolie a bit showy in her performance but she learns the less is more maxim as the film progresses particularly as she descends into the bedlam of her psychiatric treatment where she witnesses and suffers almost inhuman cruelty and deprivation before her release which sees her thenceforward display a telling stoic dignity in her pursuit of the truth. It's very much her film although the support is strong in almost every other part too.Eastwood is now very settled in his style and any viewer knows they're not going to be jolted out of their seat by anything put in their way. His skill is in storytelling and here again with the aid of fine cinematography and an effective soundtrack of his own composition he delivers a shocking story in a credible and persuasive way to keep you rooted most of the time anyway in your seat for its 160 minute duration.";

Would he and Rose really have lasted like they thought they would have? she giggled and asked if I saw Revolutionary Road I said no and she said to see this movie and my question would be answered. So here's something I never thought I would say especially in 1997 thank God Jack died! OK sorry for the lousy introduction I always like to say how I saw the movie. But I didn't just want to see Revolutionary Road because of the reunion between the extremely talented Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet but also one of my favorite directors of all time Sam MendesAmerican Beauty who took on this project in the new telling of what the American Dream is and maybe it's not always what we had expected it to be.Frank and April Wheeler moved to Revolutionary Road in one of New York City's wealthy Connecticut suburbs and have a daughter and a son in hopes of living the American dream. But April is dissatisfied with her life as a suburban housewife and Frank despises his marketing job at Knox Business Machines where his father worked for twenty years in a similar position. They feel that they are unique and special but trapped in the conformity of life in the suburbs where they moved to raise their children. On Frank's birthday April surprises him with a birthday cake and a proposal that they move to Paris with April working as a secretary to support the family so that Frank can discover what he truly wants to do in life. Frank is reluctant at first but ultimately embraces the idea and the renewed optimism breathes fresh life into their relationship. Meanwhile April becomes pregnant again she wants an abortion and has bought a device she has heard is safe if used in the first twelve weeks. Frank disapproves. Later Frank is offered a promotion and raise at work. Eventually he tells April that for the sake of the unborn baby he has decided not to go to Paris. Extremely unhappy April starts to go crazy and screams her hatred for Frank as he still tries to continue to make the perfect and comfortable life for her.This movie was really amazing it's one of the most over looked Oscar wise from 2008 both Kate and Leonardo pull in heart wrenching performances. The thing about their characters is that I saw so much of my parents in them they had all these amazing dreams together were so in love but then discover that life jumps in the front seat to what they really wanted to do. Kate's character April is receiving a lot of hate but honestly I couldn't hate her how could you? Yes she said some awful things but when it came down to it she just wanted the man she fell in love with back again she wanted to feel alive. The problem was both her and Frank were trying to run away from their problems then Frank got comfortable honestly who knows what would have fixed their problems? But I do recommend Revolutionary Road I really thought it's a small masterpiece and will get more recognition in the future I hope.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Revolutionary Road is a drama centered around an unhappy married couple living in the 1950's suburbs. They struggle dealing with their lives how things have turned out and what to do next. April Kate Winslet is a stay at home mother and wife who seems to want more than that. She had dreams of becoming an actress but it never seemed to work out. She's angry depressed and really cold at times. Frank Leonardo DiCaprio works in the city is unhappy with his job and bored with his life. He's just one of those guys that works because he has to. He needs to support his family even if he hates doing it. Inner demons and problems of his own trouble him as he tries to live out his life. These character have problems and issues just like everyone else. Sometimes they may come off as selfish cold or confusing to us. Things haven't worked out and they're upset. That's whats so interesting about this you may have friends or neighbors in relationships like this that would never think of. Everything seems great on the outside but behind closed doors it's a different story. We all have had things not go our way from time to time but it's up to us to make the best from it and move on. April and Frank have a harder time with this. Fair or not they are unhappy. You may not necessarily relate to the characters yourself but you can respect that their are people like this all the time in everyday life still that have problems they go through. They may not be as drastic as these problems but everyone has something not right with them. There are many themes in this film mainly being love marriage relationships and life.DiCaprio and Winslet give powerhouse performances. They really have a great chemistry together and seem to build off each other. Relationships are complicated and the highs and the lows are really shown extensively. All around great and believable performances with a small role by Michael Shannon who shines as the crazy guy who tells it how it is. This is a film that will probably be best known for it's acting performances.The film is directed by Sam Mendes the director of American Beauty. The film itself is visually and artistically amazing. The lighting colors sets scenes costumes everything is extremely well done. It's beautiful. I loved the cinematography. I can definitely can understand the hate or dislike for this film. Due to it's depressing subject matter it's not really a film you can sit down and just flat out enjoy or be entertained that much from. It's not a film for everyone. If you are just looking to be entertained and have a good time seeing a film I don't think I would recommend this. It's shows the stark brutal reality of an unhappy suburban couple. If your looking for a film that more than that one that is filled with terrific performances great cinematography and direction then you should check this out sometime. It's a really well made film all around but be warned it may be a hard one to enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio were the incentive of my going to see this film and I could not be more convinced of their talent than I am after the twohour brilliance. This film is reality in its purest yet magnificently artistic form  the anger that is portrayed repetitively and in various occasions reminded me of the wrath I myself occasionally experience from the overture of an argument to its climax the screaming the furious need to verbally and physically harm punch kick no matter how much affection is felt towards the recipient. Even during the scenes that are meant to be tranquil there is anxiety and tension hidden in their smiles a sort of counterfeit politeness that should never be present in a happy relationship.

They both crave change an alteration in their monotonous state of being but because of the lengthy period of time that they have spent in such a circumstance their mentality is differently modified. April Kate Winslet finds unreserved determination to leave to Paris and although her character seems at times erratic we gradually come to understand that she is in fact the stronger personality of the two she truly finds change favorable whereas Frank Leonardo DiCaprio seems to find the idea of change more flattering than change itself.Each choice a person makes can change a life and that life is not always theirs.

This film is reality in its purest yet magnificently artistic form  the anger that is portrayed repetitively and in various occasions reminded me of the wrath I myself occasionally experience from the overture of an argument to its climax the screaming the furious need to verbally and physically harm punch kick no matter how much affection is felt towards the recipient. Even during the scenes that are meant to be tranquil there is anxiety and tension hidden in their smiles a sort of counterfeit politeness that should never be present in a happy relationship.

Then you get married have kids perhaps and things change. You fight. You fight over NOTHING. You grow to loathe the person you used to love to wake up next to. The world closes in on you and things don't seem the same anymore. You daydream about what life used to be like how much love you used to be in and ask yourself  what happened??? Frank and April Wheeler meet and fall in love at a party. They talk about how their lives are going to be extraordinary and they are going to be different. They are going to live in Paris. They are never going to be those people in the suburbs. That isn't what life has in store for them. However life happens April gets pregnant and they have to settle for a life more ordinary than they had planned for with the promise that someday they will return to their dreams and complete them.The Wheeler's dreams do not ever become reality and as the bleak expanse of life stretches out ahead of April she decides to reach out for her personal brass ring and convince Frank that they are better than their home on Revolutionary Road and Frank's job with his father's company and are meant for the greatness that they once talked about having in Paris. April quickly begins to hope again that not only will her life change to what it should have been but that her and Frank will fall back in love again. Frank falls in love with the idea and agrees to go but has reservations about leaving the job he hates but that gives him a purpose in life. The plans are only a temporary bandaid as their glass house of dreams tumble around them and become a shattered illusion of what it used to be.This movie is not one that you will send your entire family to see  or even your good friends. It isn't one that everyone will get or even WANT to get. However this movie will tear out the heart of the people that have been in a relationship that has gone sour and were powerless to stop it. You try everything to stop the inevitable train wreck you see coming but yet it still ends in a fiery crash and you stand and wonder how your life could end up this way. That's Frank and April and you will come to love and hate them by the end of this movie.The acting in this movie is beyond amazing because it's simple and not overdone by the lead actors. Many things are not ever said  nor needed to be said  and were played with a flick of emotion across the face. I watched this movie expecting Kate to be the one to blow me away as usual and was shocked when it was Leo that knocked my socks off. I felt little sympathy for Frank in the novel but in the movie he plays him so well you can't help but feel sorry for him. I must mention that the supporting roles in this movie are nothing to sneeze at as well.If you are looking for a wholesome family movie that will melt your heart this isn't it. However if you are willing to deal with a bit of stark reality  this is the movie for you. It rocked me harder than American Beauty ever did.".

The film will stick in your head and leave you to contemplate what has just happened on the screen before you. Richard Yates gives us the story of Frank and April Wheeler the seemingly perfect suburbia couple. We soon find out their marriage is teetering on the edge of a collapse as they are overwhelmed by the fact that they have each made the wrong choices in their lives.Once again Kate Winselt and Leonardo DiCaprio come together with great chemistry pulling the best out of each other. This is a heavy film with emotionally complex characters I'm not sure I could think of any two actors that could pull off the roles of Frank and April Wheeler like Leonardo and Kate did.Truth is usually in singular  Lies always come in plural. I'm not sure who said that but it is a notion that sums up this film.Michael Shannon shinned in his role as the clinically insane son of Kathy Bates character John Givings. Bates and Shannon both deliver humorous scenes to this heavy storyline although there are times when you see the sadness and desperation in their characters as well. Michael Shannon's character John Givings is the truth in this film. Although clinically insane he can see through everyone's lies and does the unthinkable he forces everyone face their own truth.I guarantee you will not be singing My Heart Will Go On after seeing this film. But you won't be disappointed with this little film gem.".

	schema:reviewBody "Revolutionary Road is not a very joyful film or is it easy to watch. Instead of being simply entertaining it achieves what not many films these days do. It wants to be a learning lesson.This film is superbly crafted in both the writing and the amazing direction by Sam Mendes. After his great film 'American Beauty' he comes back with strong will to do this project. His direction is the best of the year for sure. It feels so professional so alive. The writing both of the characters Frank and April Wheeler I feel they are so open and 3dimensional characters but the screenplay wants to let us inside their lives and it does so with great passion. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Frank with such intensity with such force. Dicaprio gives his best performance here without a doubt since I don't really think he has ever done something like this before. Then there is Kate Winslet. My favorite actress and certainly one of the most talented out there. Winslet has surprised me before in a lot of movies but here she surprises me in a whole other way. Her silent unlikeable and sometimes human and cold portrayal of April Wheeler is one of the best performances of the decade. She gives the best female performance of the year and I truly hope she finally wins the Oscar she deserves.The film itself is so beautiful so alive yet at the same time so dark to what the film is about. The cinematography is amazing as well as the costumes and the whole set designs. The music the original score was so unsettling perfectly balanced to what each scene brought.Revolutionary Road is not a film for everyone. I can definitely see some critics will hate it but it should certainly be respected for its ambition for the things it accomplishes and every thing it portrays. I think this is Mendes' masterpiece. I have not seen a better made film this year.".

Allowing the audience to become fully immersed in his psyche letting us feel everything with him. Living his pain resentment and the smrgsbord of emotions in between. It is a highly accomplished piece of acting from the lead actor that I cannot imagine being ignored come this award season. Frank is a flawed man that many people will be able to see aspects of themselves in. Not being satisfied with marriage family work. Feeling we are meant or destined for something greater yet paradoxically feeling the doubt and insecurity in ourselves to really go after it. He's depressed has a past he can't seem to let go of he's arrogant he's a liar he's manipulative and in many ways immature. Yet we know him. He's our father growing up he's a brother friend or possibly even you. He makes mistakes and is almost embarrassingly human. What I found ultimately tragic about him was not the way in which he lied to others but the way in which he lied to himself. Leo DiCaprio uses his expressive face to brilliant effect as Frank. He was terrific in Aviator  Blood Diamond This Boy's Life and others and has rightfully earned his place as one of the finest actors of his generation. Having said that this is a whole new layer to DiCaprio that none of us have seen before. He brings a new mature type of authentic subtlety to his craft. He doesn't resort to any big physical transformation. It's all internal. This is a new height for him and easily the greatest acting of his career. A performance of great emotional intensity and depth that I can say without hesitation will be remembered for generations to come.Kate Winslet plays April Wheeler with a sharp fervor. She is angry depressed and intensely believes she and Frank are destined for something greater than a life of conformity in the burbs. She is a tragic character in that she is basically a closed book she shuns the love that people try to give her she is a free spirit and quite the handful. She comes up with an idea to break free of the conformity she shares with her husband in an attempt to revive their marriage and at first it seems to work  the passion for life and each other reignited. But after an unexpected event and other factors will the dream plan go through?The chemistry between Winslet and DiCaprio in Revolutionary Road reminded me in many ways of the chemistry between Liz Taylor and Richard Burton in the 1966 film Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. They create an intensity in their arguments that is electric and palpable. You cannot take your eyes off them they glue you to the screen and stick it to each other as sharply as the couple from Virginia Woolf were able to. Frank and April's story is grounded in a greater more painful reality however. DiCaprio's raging sobs are chilling.The film is very dark. And the honesty practically guts you in some cases so I don't think everyone will love it. Watching it was emotionally draining. Sam Mendes certainly did his job well here. It's his greatest film since American Beauty.".

I went as one of those people who'd read the book and consider that source material to be amongst the best literature I'd ever read. I was wondering if and how the film could match up. My prior concerns were about how accurate the film would be. Well there's nothing to worry about there. Mendes has created a near carbon copy of the book the locations characters and scenes are all exactly as I 'saw' them on the page. Nothing as far as I could tell is portrayed out of order no extra characters are introduced and no primary characters are dropped or altered. The acting is 100 perfect. The miesenscene is perfect. Absolutely nothing could or should have been done differently. So why not 1010? The problem lies in the fact that Yates' novel is a literary one much of the essence of the experience of the story is realized by Yates with just the right turn of phrase or choice of word. How does a director set about depicting or capturing this visually? I don't think he really can he needs to use cinematic tricks and devices to inject resonance the same resonance Yates achieves with that turn of phrase. But in being so probably rightly concerned about being true to the source material the film somehow comes up a little flat as a film going experience a sort of American Beauty without the crucial stylistic bells and whistles. Kate Winslett said afterward that interestingly it was she who had brought the book and the project to her husband not vice versa and that it took some consideration for Sam Mendes to convince himself that he hadn't already told this story before and by the final credits I too was thinking just that it felt like I'd watched a prequel to American Beauty but without the pizazz and the rapture and the delight.

	schema:reviewBody "Revolutionary Road has been adapted from the same named novel of Richard Yates. The setting is a suburban area on the east coast in the mid1950s. Surely there have been many changes of values in gender society and family over the decades. YetRevolutionary Road whether the film or the novel has never lost its power of confronting us people living in the globalized 21st century with all the existential issues  questions about life. This is the only movie that I have ever seen which can pose philosophical questions directly yet without compromising the engaging power of drama to its audience. It throws at us with questions about the meaning of life our responsibility to live an authentic life our freedom to make choices and decisions our desire to connect with others and maintain independence the fine line between the sane and the insane the limitations of life etc. Apparently April and Frank are diametrically opposite. April is revolutionary striving for making changes and acting out her desires Frank is reactionary always playing safe and following paths opened by others. But this is not true. Frank was ambitious before marriage. He conformed to the norm for a while but deep down he felt regretful for the lost dream. Without that intrinsic desire April would not be able to talk him into moving to Paris at all. Again Paris is just a symbol. What is less obvious but crucial for the development of the story is April's passiveness to life. All we see is she pushing Frank to live a life he wants. But what about her? What is her passion about life? We just vaguely know that she wants to be special and live an interesting life. But what exactly it is about? Acting maybe. But she decided to quit after some setback. Instead of dealing with her own disappointment fear uncertainty towards her dream she averts her frustration by imposing her dream on Frank making him believe it and actualize it. In doing so she saved herself from failure to achieve her dream. But she forbore her responsibility to live a life she wants. In short both April and Frank possess the same two conflicting dynamics in their minds. It is just that the director highlights the contrast between the pair in order to create a tugofwar situation which effectively generates a tension throughout the movie. It is very hard to side with either April or Frank because they were in one in the first place. Personally half of me goes with April and half of me goes with Frank. Despite the fact that the story is thickly embedded with philosophical propositions Revolutionary Road is still a very touching love story. From the moment April thrust her dream into Frank's hand their love was doomed. Being disillusioned and feeling trapped in a life she hates April became numb to life. There was no more love in her. As what she and Frank had said to their lunatic neighbor life became empty and hopeless to April. That's how the love's gone. So was the unborn baby. So was April. A funny question arises from Frank's definition of insanity according to Frank insanity is the inability to communicate with another human being and inability to love. How many of us are totally sane then?As always DiCaprio's acting is wonderful. He is particularly convincing when getting across the vulnerability of Frank. Kate Winslet performs well. However when I expected some liveliness in April at certain points in the movie I did not see it. The dialogues and the cinematography are very clever and powerful. We as the audience might have left the theater with a lot of questions that we fear to answer. Just as likely we might have walked away in reminiscene of our own struggles about living truthfully.This is a dense movie and worth another viewing at least.".

	schema:headline " The American Nightmare";
	schema:reviewBody "I cannot walk through the suburbs in the solitude of the night without thinking that the night pleases us because it suppresses idle details just as our memory does.   Jorge Luis BorgesEven though Sam Mendes' Revolutionary Road is set in the suburbs the reality is that it is set in a dream world an illusion The illusion of purpose of ones place in society and of what we are 'supposed' to do. We are supposed to get married we are supposed to have children and we are supposed to move to the quite suburbs and raise a family. Why? Because that is what everyone does what everyone has done and is the ingrained belief that everyone will continue to follow there is no other reason it's the blind leading the blind. That is the message that perforates the film and is the hell that consumes the lives of April and Frank Wheeler. Revolutionary Road is and intricate and intimate portrait of how the so called 'American Dream' is sometimes the 'American Nightmare'.They were happy once. Frank Wheeler Leonardo DiCaprio was fresh from the horror but freedom of the war and April Kate Winslet has great aspirations of becoming an actress. Married and in love the couple buy a modest but quaint house on Revolutionary Road. But nine years later two children and two crushed ambitions later the doldrums and encroaching insanity of suburban life consumes the Wheeler's. Frank has an affair with a new coworker at a job he cannot stand and April plays the role of mother jumping about a few tired stage plays in a desperate attempt to feel alive. Following an explosive confrontation April pitches the idea that they simply up and leave for Paris the place Frank that he visited during the war said is the only place he ever felt truly happy and vibrant. But an unexpected pregnancy and a new promotion at work stifle their globe trotting plan and the two spiral into despair. Sam Mendes is no stranger when it comes to dealing with the pressures of suburban life and as with his masterpiece American Beauty the simplicity of the narrative works to great effect. Unfortunately there are a number of things that keep this film from reaching such heights yet I assure you it is not the performances of the leads with Winslet continuing her streak of stellar work and DiCaprio exploding onto the screen with some of his best work ever. Some of the supporting cast is less effective such as a neighbour's son Michael Shannon who is given a reprieve from the mental institution where he stays. Visiting the Wheeler's he openly spouts profound insights into the horrors of conformity and in turn cranks up the subtlety of the films message to a sledgehammer across the face. I am not sure of this characters role in the novel but I assume something was lost in translation. With the highs and lows of the relationship Mendes seems to follow suit with the screenplay which is at times astoundingly emotional and disturbing and at times ghostly and uninvolving. The characters themselves are not particularly likable but the film is so haunting especially when completely over it is hard not to recommend. There is however a fine line between a film that is tragic and one that is depressing and Mendes is very close to crossing the line. But so well shot so well scripted and with such powerhouse performances it is still a solid success. Kate Winslet's character once quips You never forget the truth you just get better at lying. and with Revolutionary Road it is nothing but brutally honest and is sure to have those people dreaming of that white picket fence and two car garage seriously re examining their 'dream'.Read all my reviews at httpwww.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " Winslet And Dicaprio Wage War With One Another Every Second of the Way Through";
	schema:reviewBody "Without the great presence of Dicaprio and Winslet this film would seriously be at the level of a TV movie. Revolutionary Road is a film that certainly will not cheer you up. It is about a husband and wife who make an attempt at escaping there their empty and hopeless life. Or at least they create the delusion that they will.In this film Winslet and Dicaprio are at the top of their games. Their feelings toward each other are complex and deranged. Their bitterness towards each other seems to disappear as the movie wears on but it does not. They simply put the bitterness they feel for each other in the back of their mind thinking it will go away and it may have. But when one key event takes place in the movie their bitterness evolves into hatred. Instead of continuing to fight the lie of what people think it means to lead a good life which is what drew them to each other in the first place they start to accept that lie causing them to drift apart in so many ways. Dicaprio and Winslet are one of the few that are able to so perfectly illustrate complexities such as this in relationships and marriage. Michael Shannon plays a very interesting role of a man considered crazy yet is the only one who agrees with the emptyness and hopelessness of their lives. He plays well but I feel as if something is missing from his character.The directing of Sam Mendes is good in that the film brings you back in time. Yet the movie did not rise to what it could have been because of the writing. The film did not open up enough to fully capture the audience. The film stayed one gear and never seemed to switch off it. The couple of Winslet and Dicaprio seemed to be happy at one point but we barely get a glimpse of that. If the movie had started off on that and then switched over to its false hope and then depressing tone it would have greatly succeeded. Instead the movie becomes overly depressing and cynical not living up to its potential.".

In this Richard Yates story portrayed through the lens of Mr. Mendes' camera we enter the relationship of Frank and April Wheeler a young married couple depicted brilliantly by DiCaprio and Winslet who seem to be on the verge of marital and emotional collapse as their growing desperation and dissatisfaction with their town and their relationship leads them to think of an escape. There are some compelling memorable emotionally gripping scenes between DiCaprio and Winslet which should interest acting students who wish to know what it means to be in the moment. Additionally there is the immensely talented Kathy Bates whose humorous scenes balance out the heavily dramatic ones nicely and which are sure to leave a warm spot on your heart. Also adding humor to the movie is Michael Shannon as Bates' psychologically unstable son who steals just about every scene he's in. There are moments where the dialogue can seem to feel clich but with everything else working so well those moments can be forgiven. This is a film not to be missed. I've become a greater admirer of DiCaprio's acting ability as a result of this film Winslet never disappoints and Mendes adds another superb credit to his resume with this amazing film. December 26th. Save the date!!!".

DiCaprio and Winslet's chemistry was once again flawless I honestly felt like I was watching a 50's suburban couple fighting about normal every day problems no scripts. All of the supporting cast was superb especially Kathy Bates and Michael Shannon who should both be very tough contenders to beat for the best actress and best supporting actor Oscars respectively.Thank you Sam Mendes for giving the American people another great drama to watch that really gave people a dose of what the perfect 50's suburban life was really like.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was flatout out of the best movies I've ever seen. But I have been reading some comments about this movie and I want to clear some things up.April is NOT selfish! She really loves Frank and would do anything to make him happy. She and him and both miserable in suburbia and she knows that Frank hates the job he works at. So she suggests that they go away. She only says Paris because she knows it's one of the only places he's ever been to that makes him feel alive. She wants him to find a job that makes him happy. In fact I firmly believe that if he told her he wanted to be a flamingo dancer she would buy him the suit and let him do the cancan all over the house if it made him happy. When he accepts her offer to got to Paris she feels that everything will be perfect. But then she hears him on the beach telling someone else about the job offer. She is crushed not only because she was the last to know but because it was like he was stomping on her dream of happiness for the family.She decides then that she's done...that she just can't handle it anymore. She is tired of living a lie that she is happy when she knows fullwell that she isn't. She loves him but frankly marriage and kids is draining the life out of her. I think when she heard what she heard on the beach and Frank said Why don't you let that be my business or whatever he said he was basically telling her it was his life and to stay out of it. That's why the whole fight in the woods scene happened...she had made up her mind. She wanted out. You may not agree with her decision but I can definitely understand it.And Frank is not a bad man. Yes I am aware that he cheated on April. But so did she. He's the type of man that needs to be loved and appreciated. I think he felt he wasn't getting that with April. He loves her and cares about her but she's a lot for him to handle. Especially in the opening scene when they get into a fight about the play. He can see that she is hurting that it bombed and he wants to make her feel better. But he doesn't know what to say and whatever he says is wrong to April because she's already in a terrible mood. And you know men...they mean well but sometimes they are totally clueless. And he felt awful about cheating. Did you see the closeup when April and the kids sang happy birthday to him. He felt like the biggest jerk! The acting was amazing. Leonardo DiCaprio was unbelievable as Frank. In the scene where April tells him she hates him and he cries it ripped me apart inside. I don't know...something about men crying bothers me. Kate was wonderful as usual. I hope she wins that Oscar. The best thing about this movie was that DiCaprio and Winslet could speak volumes without saying a single word. It was all in their eyes. Sam Mendes is a genius! Anyway I think I'm rambling now so I'll leave you to decide for yourself what you think of this movie. I as you can see fully enjoyed it.".

She really loves Frank and would do anything to make him happy. She and him and both miserable in suburbia and she knows that Frank hates the job he works at. So she suggests that they go away. She only says Paris because she knows it's one of the only places he's ever been to that makes him feel alive. She wants him to find a job that makes him happy. In fact I firmly believe that if he told her he wanted to be a flamingo dancer she would buy him the suit and let him do the cancan all over the house if it made him happy. When he accepts her offer to got to Paris she feels that everything will be perfect. But then she hears him on the beach telling someone else about the job offer. She is crushed not only because she was the last to know but because it was like he was stomping on her dream of happiness for the family.She decides then that she's done...that she just can't handle it anymore. She is tired of living a lie that she is happy when she knows fullwell that she isn't. She loves him but frankly marriage and kids is draining the life out of her. I think when she heard what she heard on the beach and Frank said Why don't you let that be my business or whatever he said he was basically telling her it was his life and to stay out of it. That's why the whole fight in the woods scene happened...she had made up her mind. She wanted out. You may not agree with her decision but I can definitely understand it.And Frank is not a bad man. Yes I am aware that he cheated on April. But so did she. He's the type of man that needs to be loved and appreciated. I think he felt he wasn't getting that with April. He loves her and cares about her but she's a lot for him to handle. Especially in the opening scene when they get into a fight about the play. He can see that she is hurting that it bombed and he wants to make her feel better. But he doesn't know what to say and whatever he says is wrong to April because she's already in a terrible mood. And you know men...they mean well but sometimes they are totally clueless. And he felt awful about cheating. Did you see the closeup when April and the kids sang happy birthday to him. He felt like the biggest jerk! The acting was amazing. Leonardo DiCaprio was unbelievable as Frank. In the scene where April tells him she hates him and he cries it ripped me apart inside. I don't know...something about men crying bothers me. Kate was wonderful as usual. I hope she wins that Oscar. The best thing about this movie was that DiCaprio and Winslet could speak volumes without saying a single word. It was all in their eyes. Sam Mendes is a genius! Anyway I think I'm rambling now so I'll leave you to decide for yourself what you think of this movie. I as you can see fully enjoyed it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Frank and April Wheeler live in Revolutionary Road a Connecticut suburb. April is a failed artist and so lives at home taking care of her children. Frank is a businessman and works at a dead end city job. Both are disillusioned finding little substance in the daily grind of life.From here on the film merely rehashes themes fully covered by Antonioni half a century ago. Frank and April see their dissatisfaction firstly as sexual unfulfillment and secondly as a product of their environment. In an attempt to find happiness Frank thus has a meaningless affair with a young woman whilst April has sex with a friend and later a baby with her husband. But no such fleeting moments of biological bliss cannot quench what is really an existential problem. And so when Frank and April decide to move to France echoing the countless characters in Antonioni's filmography who run away we know that the couple are merely pursuing an empty fantasy. Man's greatest flaw is his incessant belief that some external change can bring about an internal state of bliss.The sickness that Frank and April feel was long diagnosed by Nietzsche when he noted that western civilisation was fast moving in the direction of the Last Man a listless creature with no great passion or commitment. Unable to dream tired of life he takes no risks seeking only comfort tolerance and security.Today First World countries find it increasingly difficult even to imagine a public or universal cause for which one would be ready to sacrifice one's life. Indeed the split between First and Third World runs increasingly along the lines of an opposition between leading a long satisfying life full of material and cultural wealth and dedicating one's life to some transcendent cause. This is the antagonism between what Nietzsche called passive and active nihilism. We in the West are the Last Men immersed in stupid daily pleasures whilst Eastern radicals are ready to risk everything engaged in nihilistic struggle up to the point of selfdestruction. What is gradually disappearing in this opposition between those who are in the Last Men who dwell in gated communities and those who are out are the good old middle classes. The middle class is a luxury capitalism can no longer afford.One of the successors of Antonioni's malaise movies is Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut a film which expands on the postmodern malaise found in all those existential films of the past 2 decades American Beauty Fight Club The Ice Storm Blue Velvet Safe Fear and Loating Being John Malkovich Revolutionary Road In the Bedroom Little Children etc by tackling the class and power relationships around its disillusioned couple. Though it also centres on a couple one a failed artist Alice and the other a doctor Bill Kubrick's film probes beneath the fantasy image giving his characters a context which these films typical lack.On the surface Eyes looks at the dark side of sexual liberation the full commodification of sexuality the sterility of a universe dominated by the superego order to enjoy the collapse of religion and tradition the worship of pleasure and youth and the prospect of a future totalised by scientific rationality and joylessness. In this world love cannot flourish without sex simultaneously however love is impossible because of sex. Sex which proliferates as the epitome of late capitalism's dominance has permanently stained human relationships. Sex is thus as Derrida states simultaneously the condition of the possibility and the impossibility of love. It is both nothing and everything.But more importantly Eyes is concerned with power ownership and money and the way they connect with the issues of identity intimacy and sexuality raised by films like Revolutionary Road. Indeed Bill's relationship with a mysterious power figure called Ziegler is at as pivotal in Kubrick's film as his relationship with his wife. Ziegler represents patriarchy the symbolic order yet he is also something of a Sadean libertine. He is both the Father who says No guarantor of the symbolic order and the Father who enjoys wrecker of the symbolic.You might thus say that films like Revolutionary Road which reduce their problems to domestic disputes serve only to cut psychology loose from everything else. It's a type of hermetic antisocial ahistorical version of psychology assuming that the whole cosmos is important only in relation to the conscious white male subject which incidentally is exactly the sleepwalking egocentric complacency Bill begins Eyes Wide Shut so conspicuously cocooned in.Few other films of the past decade another is Lynch's Mulholland Dr successfully attempt to open out domestic melodrama into the wider context of power privilege and patriarchy and Revolutionary Road is no different never developing beyond the complacent mindset of smugly moralising Hollywood liberalism.Indeed while Frank keeps his wife at home and out of a job Bill wants nothing less than to block out female desire entirely. Women aren't like that he says hence his attraction to prostitutes and masked women. As sex workers they resume the assigned place of women in his libidinal economy they are passive recipients of male desire not as Alice has so terrifyingly revealed herself to be agents of their own desire. And of course it is the frightening realisation that he is himself an object exploited in another's desire that leads to Bill retreating to fantasy fantasy being the very banal reality that Frank and April live in.And so it is the flight into the ordinary the domestic the apparently wellconstituted identity that represents escape for The Last Man but more importantly it is power and capital that he believes facilitates the actualisation of his dreams.610  Outdated 60's existentialism. Mendes strikes me as the new Anthony Minghella both theatre directors. Mendes hides behind his cinematographers and though his images are always clean and precisely composed one senses no real visual imagination.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many people have said that Sam Mendes' latest forage into dark American suburbia in Revolutionary Road is how Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's characters from Titanic would be like had they have married in that film and Jack Dawson not met his effusive watery grave.The film explores from the very start a broken relationship between the two brought on by banal life on the quiet Connecticut Revolutionary Road and both of them leaving behind the idealistic dreams of youth with DiCaprio's Frank Wheeler in an uninspiring sales job and Winslet's April Wheeler locked into the position of a housewife briefly flirting with the world of theatre.It is perhaps fitting that the opening scenes culminating in a blazing row on an interstate roadside between the two come after April feels she has failed in an amateur theatrical production. The movie feels like it has been adapted from a stage play rather than Richard Yates' novel with bulleted delineated locations and intense dialogue.But it is the smouldering argumentative scenes between the Wheeler's that perhaps lead to a lack of fulfilment from the movie. While the feel is very Ingmar Bergmanesquire with gloomy and dark emotions bubbling under the surface the movie does not portray the wider framework of the marriage strongly enough to carry these off.The focal point of the film comes when April seizes on a former conversation between the two when Frank describes Paris in passionate terms discussing his presence there in the World War II. In an attempt to reignite their lives April suggests they set about moving to the European city so Frank can discover his true calling in life.This provides an interesting pathway and allows the story to grow through the reactions of Frank's colleagues a couple they're friends with their former estate agent Kathy Bates in her element as an interfering matriarch and the Wheeler's two children.It may come as a surprise that I had not referred to the children previously especially as they fuel the destruction in Frank and April's marriage with Frank questioning whether April actually loves her children at all. The children themselves barely feature merely used as plot tools to bring the narrative forward. This would not be such a problem but without any form of internal narration from either of them the sense of the true relationship between April and her kids is unclear and makes this aspect feel isolated.The cold hard realities of the failing marriage are spotted by the estate agent's son a mentally unstable man temporarily allowed out of an asylum a notable performance from Michael Shannon who frankly and with spite notices the hypocrisies and deterioration within the Wheelers romance.The film uses setpieces and the supporting cast to attempt to heighten the magnitude of admittedly bravely performed sequences between DiCaprio and Winslet eventually reaching an engaging though predictable climax. While the movie is certainly not revolutionary in terms of its portrayal of a declining marriage the television series Mad Men set in a similar suburban setting does this with much more care and intricacy it is a solid piece of work from Mendes but cannot approach his seminal American Beauty. However one is left longing for a greater insight into why and how the relationship has reached this point to provide much needed groundwork to the frequent marital disputes.".

	schema:reviewBody "I couldn't help but feel disappointed when I walked out of the theater following Revolutionary Road. My expectations were lofty because I loved what Sam Mendes did with American Beauty 1010 and I was intrigued by Jarhead 710 as well. Of course the preliminary bar was set high for a film featuring both Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.And yet I was underwhelmed by the final product that was Revolutionary Road. No this wasn't a clichd case of setting the bar TOO high because I always keep my pregame expectations in check. They're there but I don't allow them to cloud my judgment.Mendes was fine his mise en scene was a bit mundane and predictable yet still mostly effective. I would like to have searched for more subtlety when dealing with a director of Mendes' caliber but it just wasn't there this time. Only shot that jumps out at me is the one of the sprinkler spout metaphorically separating April Wheeler from her family.As for the performances I felt that Winslet slightly outperformed Leo. Not that that's especially relevant because neither performance was awardworthy. I'm shocked that Winslet could take home two Golden Globes in one year when one of those Globes was awarded for her work in this film. She was good but not outstanding.I must tread carefully though because I shouldn't blame Winslet or DiCaprio for the shortcomings of the script. On the whole the dialogue was absolutely painful  nothing original came for seemingly endless sets of time. I'm aware that the screenplay was adapted from a novel so perhaps the faults lie in the novel itself. Yet that's not what I'm hearing from those who read and loved the book.I was intrigued by the general concept of the film because we all struggle with the internal conflict of our dreams vs. reality and many of us struggle with the comfortable suburbia vs. monotonous suburbia conflict as well. But Revolutionary Road was overkill in both arenas. Just too much of the same throughout calm before the storm match lit match explosion. Calm before the storm match lit match explosion.Much of the repetition may have been intentional but it simply wasn't effective. How Roger Ebert gave Revolutionary Road four stars out of four absolutely boggles my mind.This film is a 610 at best. If you love great cinema you will be disappointed. Revolutionary Road is a level below.".

	schema:reviewBody "The art of storytelling whether in a play a novel or a film is to create characters who become real. And once you identify with the characters their lives become the vehicle for the tone and message of the work. Without such realism such verisimilitude there is nothing but parody and the manipulation of stock figures.I am a great fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet so I was looking forward to seeing them in a serious exploration of an era that I lived through as a young man. This work was stunningly without substance. Oh there were emotions but the characters were not believable and worse there was no attempt to make it so. The clue is the two children throw away place holders so they never even became people. Yet children are a part of any family and we can't know the family without knowing the joys and trials of these most vulnerable members.A good test that I use of the quality of any film is whether there are throwaway characters or if every person seems to have walked in from their own full life. If they only utter a single line you can still tell. The mental patient visitor was some kind of a joke I imagine. Not like anyone with schizophrenia that I ever met and I met a few.And it's not trivial that Frank could never describe exactly what he did for a living. The writers never bothered to create an occupation that would have fit the plot. So he was just a man in a cubicle. A nobody with no interest in his work but who was made a key member of a team to develop the most complex product of the era who had no idea what it did or how it worked.Some may consider this transcending details to provide a cultural everyman. But everyman is no man at all.This wasn't a dysfunctional marriage as that implies that there is first a marriage. The film The Squid and the Whale was about a dysfunctional marriage where the couple were at each others throats Yet both of them and their children were real unique struggling humans trapped in their history and that of their circle. That was a true work of art while this was an exercise in a drama class.For those who think this is some accurate depiction of America in the 1950s believe me it isn't. If you want to see a film about a dysfunctional couple of the era try Come back little Sheba or Death of a Salesman. Each of these films created actual characters and we were drawn into their lives as we learned about the era.This film was about 2008 and how when two super stars are signed for a film deal there is no need to throw away money on writers who flesh out their characters and provide plausible circumstances of their lives.I just learned that the director of this film was the same man who directed American Beauty one of my all time favorites.Go figure!".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow I am shocked at how bad this film was! It was a boring pointless 2  hour pain that I am surprised has gotten so many great reviews. I think  many posters on here miss the point when people like me complain about  the movie. I thought Winslet was okay but seemed mannered and  annoying. DiCaprio was just flat out annoying in this. He sounded like  a 15 yearold boy at his first high school play. Both actors seemed  again far too young to be playing these characters.  The film lacks story arc structure and most importantly...CHARACTER  DEVELOPMENT! One of the first things they teach you in film school Mr.  Mendes is that you need to have CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT to make your  audience care about what's happening to the people on screen. This  movie opens up with Kate and Leo fighting. We don't care about the  fight however because we don't know who the hell these people are. As  the movie progresses we still don't see anything hint about who these  people are. He works at a boring job. She's a housewife. Gee like we  never have seen one of these stories be told before. And then nothing  happens! There's no plot! The movie is an excuse for Winslet and  DiCaprio to have yelling matches together. It's like watching a VH1  reality show shot in 35mm. What's more we don't feel or care about the  characters. When ever Winslet cried I cringed. It's being touted as  one of her best performances? Really? I thought it was mannered  controlled and whiny. She's done billions times better then this stuff.  And DiCaprio is just flatout BAD. Perhaps I would think they did  better jobs if I cared at all about the movie's premise.  On top of this the film is morbidly predictable and clich.  SPOILER! When Kate is Upset one morning and having a fit in the  kitchen Leo asks her what's wrong. It's so blatantly obvious she's  pregnant and having Morning Cramps. And then of course she says she  wants an abortion. I knew what was going to happen before it did.  Mendes a master of storytelling with American BEAUTY and ROAD TO  PERDITION fails so low here I almost feel bad for him. Every shot of  this movie looks like its designed for Academy Awards in the Art  Direction and Cinematography department. But there's no substance at  all to the storytelling. Every shot is a silhouette or closeup of  boring dramatic angles that mean nothing other then to have dumb  audiences go Oooo now that's a great camera angle. If this movie  gets nominations from the Oscars which it will I will know its  because those voters haven't seen the movie yet and are voting for it  on name bases alone.  FINAL GRADE F".

We are hit with a most melodramatic picture of everyday events in a script that fails to create actual conflicts and believable drama. In such a farce the luxury of the intense performances given by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are outrageously wasted.Fans of the actors will undoubtedly enjoy it of course and such an effort certainly deserves recognition. But the story itself contributes nothing neither to the film history wealth nor to the poor audience's expectations that are likely to feel rather down after the show or even mad at the whole world for no apparent reason just like the protagonist couple.".

	schema:headline " The American dream is actually a nightmare.";
	schema:reviewBody "A young couple living in 1950's suburbia think they are different from all the other families living the American Dream. Although they soon find out that not every dream comes true and they fall exactly into the situations they didn't want to be in. Their marriage is falling apart they have trouble raising their children and they want out of this lifestyle.Sam Mendes is a filmmaker who knows exactly what he wants which is why he would want to work on this film. Revolutionary Road is probably his least interesting film story wise. Afterall it's just about two people who try to cope with their lives. There is no motivational plot to it but the thing about this film is that it doesn't need one. We are getting a glimpse into the lives of two people who had big dreams and realized that they had to sacrifice them in order to live their lives. It's sad but it also rings true. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as the married couple who constantly fight. Everyone called this film the What If Jack and Rose Ended Up Together movie. Yet it is so much more than that. They give powerful performances which unfortunately were overlooked during the Oscar season. Another Titanic star Kathy Bates gives her support to the couple as the real estate agent who thinks the world of them. She has a son who is mentally unstable and asks to bring him over for dinner one night. Michael Shannon plays the son and he steals both scenes he is in. For a guy who is deemed insane he is the only one who speaks the truth. I watched this flick because so many people told me how depressing it was. While it was depressing I didn't find it to be that bad. The most depressing aspect of the film is how relatable it is to real life. This story happens everywhere and that is the sad part. The cinematography is great the 1950's feel was spot on and really gave the film more of a cinematic sense of wonder to it. Roger Deakins seems to know exactly what is needed for every film he takes on. The look and feel of the film here is so simple yet so beautiful at the same time. Finally I can see why people may not like this film. It's definitely an acquired taste. I was not in love with it by any means and for those involved it's not their best work. Instead it's a film to enjoy once. I wouldn't bother watching it again because the pace is long and I feel that I won't be as engaged a second time. On a final note why do guys from the 1950's only last about 15 seconds?".

	schema:reviewBody "My grandparents still consider the 1950's to be the golden age of pure unblemished Americanism. A time when teenagers were respectful parents were bright smiling examples of friendly authority sex was postmarital and marriage was a time of apple pies and cheerful strolls down the charming neighborhood lane. I don't know at the moment if my grandparents have seen Revolutionary Road but rarely do movies come along when the opinions of our elders would almost surely prove to be enormously valuable and insightful.The movie is based on the novel by Richard Yates which attacked the very normality and pleasant conformity of the 1950's that forms the basis of so much of the modern nostalgia about it today. There has been a lot of expectation about the movie that would bring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet together again for the first time in more than a decade but the romance that they share in Revolutionary Road could not possibly be more different from the one they developed on the Titanic.They are Frank and April Wheeler an outwardly charming husband and wife who live in a beautiful dream house on Revolutionary Road. They radiate an atmosphere of perfection and happiness and are loved by the neighbors. We meet them just after they've made what they promised each other was only a temporary move from Manhattan to the sprawling suburbs. The movie begins with April in an unsuccessful play and we learn very quickly about their relationship in the car on the way home as Frank thoughtfully assures her that it's okay that she didn't become an actress it's not her fault that the play was lousy and then in the fight that ensues Frank tells her that she acts sick when she gets mad like this.It seems that the most important thing that Frank and April embody about the traditional 1950s couple was the routine sacrificing of dreams upon the altar of conformity and fulfilling expectations. April dreams of a romantic life in Paris and Frank has artistic ambitions as well. But he is stuck in a job that he hates despite a good salary they have two kids already and a third accidentally on the way and adultery's going on left and right.April suggests that they drop everything and move to Paris where with money that she could make working combined with whatever they could get for the house they could live comfortably until he could get on his feet artistically and they could both live the lives they have always dreamed of. They are doing what is expected of them already but they're both deeply unhappy and they see no improvement ahead. It is one of the movie's more successful tragic moments in the way that everyone Frank and April know react to the news that they are moving. Responses range from friendly disbelief to outward remarks of irresponsibility and suggestions that such a move would be irresponsible. It's hard to watch Frank and April let go of their dreams when it was right in their grasp.It's not unrealistic ladies and gentlemen. It's uncommon and unexpected but unrealistic? Irresponsible? I should hope not! It's commonly believed to be irresponsible and unrealistic but it's not trust me. I'm doing it myself. I left a job in Los Angeles two years ago that paid well but that I didn't like and I've been living in China decidedly less romantic than Paris I admit ever since. I now have a job that pays less than I made in LA but my lifestyle is much more comfortable and I work 10 hours a week which leaves me time to pursue my artistic endeavors. See how that works?Granted I don't have any kids but I also didn't have a house to sell to put together some money to support myself while I found work. I just think people are better off doing some kind of work that they actually like Frank complains. I tend to agree.But ultimately life gets in the way as they say. A gossipy real estate agent played perfectly by Kathy Bates makes friends with April and nervously asks if she might bring over her son John who has been in a mental institution and who she thinks might benefit from meeting a happy couple like April and Frank. April agrees but when John comes over it seems that his only mental problem is an inability to adhere to accepted models of conformity which manifests itself mostly in the form of cutting through other peoples' facades like warm butter and laying bare the sad bitter reality of their lives. When he does this with April and Frank the results are not pretty but they are some of the best movie moments of 2008.Kate and Leo both approach perfection in their performances. Both of them have appeared in other brilliant films in 2008 Kate in The Reader and Leo in Body of Lies but in Revolutionary Road their performances reach such a level of pitch and depth that when combined they reverberate against each other and turn into something entirely different. If there were an Oscar for the best combination of two performances there would be no need for any other nominees.Revolutionary Road is not the most uplifting film of the year although it's also not nearly as depressing as say Rachel Getting Married but it is definitely among the most important. It's not so much that the movie attacks conformity but that it attacks that little voice inside us that prevents us from doing what we really want in life because it goes against the accepted norm. Watching the movie kind of takes a bite out of you but it takes a bite of that part of you that gets in the way of your dreams.".

The investigation part of the story is excellent. Although it is 2.5 hours long it is never boring.The soundtrack was also very fitting and helped to set the mood of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "I am among I guess those very few people in Europe who have not read the bestselling novel by Stieg Larsson but not feeling in the mood to see another too emotionally engaging romance or drama although its being my favourite genre I went to see what is depicted by Larsson's fans as a captivating and gripping thriller.Indeed I can't say whether the movie proves adherence to the novel which is something by the way difficult considering the length of the book however I can say that the product is a wellcrafted piece of cinema which leaves also interesting food for thought. Used as we are as southern Europeans to see at Northern and mainly Scandinavian countries as models of democracy economic progress and social welfare it's quite surprising to see a modern Sweden stained by corruption and unscrupulous tycoons. Moreover it is quite upsetting to get to know how Nazi extremist and insane ideas were rooted not so much in the history of the country but in the conscience of people in this case of a powerful and wealthy family where the hatred towards the Jews has mixed with the hatred towards women turning the lives of whole generations into a hell of ferocious violence and horror.As far as the thriller story it's engaging but carried on very carefully every aspect being under control with flashbacks constantly reassuring us about aspects we have already perceived without moving a little apart from a well consolidated stylistic model of this kind of movie genre. Sometimes a little slow sometimes too indulging in violent scenes but with a strong directing consciousness supporting it. Convincing and really good the performances offered by the whole cast unknown to the great public but I would underline the actress playing Lisbeth as really outstanding and upsetting in her mental and emotional distress. On the whole it's not a masterpiece but a good and well made movie.".

Inside the package post marked in Hong Kong is a framed plant. The camera starts to move backwards taking in more of the room and revealing SvenBertil Taube as the opener of the package. He holds the frame in his hands lowers his head and slowly starts to cry.Niels Arden Oplevs Mn som hatar kvinnor is based on the first of Stieg Larssons three bestselling novels meaning of course that it is basically guaranteed large box office numbers  but the expectations will probably match those numbers. Weather the film manages to live up to these expectations I cannot say  seeing as I am one of the probably only eight people who has not read Stieg Larssons books. But as a piece of cinema completely removed from its literary origins it definitely leaves an impression!The music mentioned above written by Peter Fuchs is the first thing to register in the mind as something interesting Something that make everything feel very serious. The impendingdoomscore composed by Howard Shore for David Finchers Se7en springs to mind  and this only a few seconds into the film.The cold hard uncomfortable reality  where the movie takes place  is populated by a highly recognizable legion of people straight out of Swedens acting elite Gsta Bredenfeldt Lena Endre Ewa Frling Bjrn Granath Peter Haber och Marika Lagerkrantz to mention a few and they all seem to have been so thrilled to be a part of this project that they almost as one has taken their characters a step back allowing the spotlight to be shone on the two main characters who also get to drive the story forward the reporter Mikael Blomkvist Mikael Nyqvist who is digging through a 40 year old murder case involving a well known corporation family with Nazi connections and the 24 year old computer hacker EMO Lisbeth Salander Noomi Rapace that every day hacks Blomkvists hard drive captivated by the puzzling evidence or lack thereof.Nyqvist gets the job done playing what is basically the lesser of the two parts. You instinctively feel sympathy for him and sympathizes with him  even in his very first scene in which his character is convicted of slander and sentenced to prison.But when the lights come back on in the theatre and you gather up your half eaten box of popcorn and your coat it's not Mikael Nyqvists understated but persistent reporter you will remember mostit's Noomi Rapaces leatherandstud clad tattooed pierced heavy makeup wearing biker chick Lisbeth Salander.Weighted by old wrongdoings as well as new ones Lisbeth is covered in emotional scars making her a very interesting character  that easily could have been a silly rehash a Gunvald Larsson in leather. But Noomi Rapace bases Lisbeth in real emotions rather than clichs and hammy over acting. You can tell that there is a real person behind that steely gazed unyielding face something that make those parts of the movie where we get to come with her through what must be some of Swedish cinemas most horrendous scenes feel that much more awful. You almost can't help looking away as she is abused over and over againThe relationship between Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander is the only part where I felt the movie rushed things just a tad. But this is only a mild piece of criticism as the lack of insight leaves the audience feeling that they just like the character Mikael Blomkvist don't know what to make of Lisbeht Salander.Besides the two leads I want to single out Peter Haber who really got to show off his skills! He is obviously good for more than just playing the silly father of Sune or the annoyingly correct police Martin Beck.I have like I mentioned earlier not read the novels by Stieg Larsson and I have an automatic aversion towards Swedish cinema which I usually find stiff with acting taken straight out of the latest grocery store commercials. In other words Swedish film has its work cut out trying to sell me anything. But and I am not ashamed to admit this I'm gonna go ahead and BUY!!!In the narrow little world that is Swedish cinema there is a lot that one could  or even should  avoid. But this movie is not something to be ignored! So leave the kids at home this is NOT a very pleasant film and head for your nearest multiplex to take in of the most thrilling Swedish films in a very long time!".

	schema:headline " Loyal adaption of best seller book";
	schema:reviewBody "Mn som hatar Kvinnor is a whodunit thriller revolving around sadism towards women. It is based on the first book in Stieg Larsson's crime trilogy with the main characters journalist Mikael Blomkvist and outcast hacker Lisbeth Salander. For the record this trilogy has had rave reviews and been among the best selling books in Scandinavia. An aging corporate executive Henrik Vanger employs Blomkvist to solve the puzzle of his missing niece  A girl who mysteriously disappeared 40 years earlier. It has become an obsession to this man to shed some light on his missing niece's fate and he is desperate to have closure before it's his own time to pass. Over the years 82 year old Henrik Vanger has been gathering a substantial amount of hints and clues but he was never able to put the pieces together. Acclaimed journalist Mikael Blomkvist is hired for his researching skills following a thorough background check. Blomkvist's recent committal order doesn't discourage Vanger. He shows no interest for compromise in getting the right man for the job.Eventually Blomkvist teams up with secluded computer hacker Lisbeth Salander. Their investigation unfolds a complex set of clues leading to a string of morbid sadistic murders spanning decades. Pieces of the puzzle slowly start falling into place as inevitable confrontation with the hidden villain draws closer. Alongside this main plot line both of our main characters have to deal with personal problems that act as obstacles for the main chase and help us understand our main characters.When I read Mn som hatar kvinnor a few years back I told my friends This would make a great movie. It sure does. Mn som hatar kvinnor is an ambitious project. Casting character and location alike adapting the book to script and production seem to set new standards for Scandinavian movie making. It has an international feel and does the book great justice. Key scenes from the book are flawlessly executed and the characters are captured very convincingly. Fans of the book shouldn't be disappointed. Almost three hours running time allows great depth and detail but even at this length some plot lines have been left out. This does not hurt the overall feel though. It is still a coherent movie focusing on the main plot line. Avid fans can turn to the text version for further explanations and still be intrigued. The Lisbeth Salander character is an inventive take on a heroine. She is a believable and obvious contrast to the sadistic women degrading evildoers. This 90 pound female hacker is depicted as being the craftier stronger and more energetic of our heroic duo. This does however hurt Blomkvists character a bit leaving him seemingly not too bright and kind of helpless. I DO like a female heroine though which is a welcome twist to the classic detective genre. The novels give Blomkvist a bit more room to shine on his own which is the only thing I'm missing in the movie. Great performances all around. Most reviews will obviously comment on Noomi Rapaces outstanding performance as Lisbeth Salander and put her on a well deserved pedestal. I'm going to point the attention to SvenBertil Taube Henrik Vanger and Peter Haber Martin Vanger who both do great jobs as supporting actors.".

The Lisbeth Salander character is an inventive take on a heroine. She is a believable and obvious contrast to the sadistic women degrading evildoers. This 90 pound female hacker is depicted as being the craftier stronger and more energetic of our heroic duo. This does however hurt Blomkvists character a bit leaving him seemingly not too bright and kind of helpless. I DO like a female heroine though which is a welcome twist to the classic detective genre. The novels give Blomkvist a bit more room to shine on his own which is the only thing I'm missing in the movie. Great performances all around. Most reviews will obviously comment on Noomi Rapaces outstanding performance as Lisbeth Salander and put her on a well deserved pedestal. I'm going to point the attention to SvenBertil Taube Henrik Vanger and Peter Haber Martin Vanger who both do great jobs as supporting actors.";

Some of the scenes are graphic and violent but if you have read the book you already know this. However even though I had to read the movie I cant wait for the next one. At least I hope they are making a movie for book 2 and 3 I would not take my 14yr old to this but it is something I would see again. Highly recommend!".

Structured much more fluidly than the Hollywood version the mystery of a missing girl flows and develops slowly dishing out red herrings and suspense with each turn something lacking in the Fincher version. It also stays closer to the original title of the book and theme Men who Hate Women. In the end this is a dark tale of what rape does to women and to the world.

Since this happened during a family reunion at an isolated island the patriarch believes that she was murdered and that only a member of the family could have done so. Mikael is soon joined in the investigation by Lisbeth Salander a troubled but brilliant twenty something female hacker and soon they are lifting the veil on the very dark secrets behind this prestigious family.

Not that she is bad but she is just as we always see her. Musicwise a big step in the right direction. I think of Howard Shore scores from Seven and Silence of the lambs. Too bad that the movie sound the dialog in particular doesn't hold the same standard. Also not to give anything away in the final scenes bear in mind Bourne Ultimatum last scenes and Silence of the lambs final. In short hats of to this magnificent film.

This film contains the most brutal rape scene imaginable and I nearly had to stop watching but I could not stop watching her  there was something about her that promised me that this was not gratuitous sadism. I cheered my guts out when she cleverly trapped the human predator and exacted justice. I had not read the book so I had no idea this was coming. Noomi's performance is beyond 10. I can't think of another actress who has gone this deep in drama and I want her to know it was a very satisfying movie to watch  not mere entertainment  it was cathartic. Thank you.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo takes us into the investigation of one Harriet Vanger who disappeared when she was just 16 years old and has been missing for the last 40 years. Still distraught about Harriet's case her uncle Henrik Vanger hires troubled journalist Mikael Blomksvist to find out what happened. Along the way he teams up with Lisbeth Salander an eccentric hacker genius and what they uncover is far worse than they could have ever imagined.What is beautiful about this film is the simplicity of how it was made without it appearing cheap. It is proof that the lack of special effects doesn't make a film dull. In fact it only makes other aspects shine. The movie is dialoguedriven and a lot of things are explained through the conversations. It is quite unfortunate that I do not understand Swedish and I had to use the subtitles while watching it because I feel it would have been a better experience if I did.Of course behind these dialogues are the two leads Blomkvist and Salander. A recipe for a good movie is comprised of a compelling story characters viewers can sympathize with and care about and the interactions among these characters. For the most part The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is able to accomplish these things. Because of the film I now understand why Noomi Rapace Sherlock Holmes Game of Shadows has suddenly been propelled to the spotlight. Indeed her performance as Lisbeth Salander is incredible. The late Stieg Larsson would have been proud of her interpretation of his title character. Salander is arguably the most unique female protagonist the industry has seen for a long time. From her looks to her personality we see her as complex yet somebody we can understand talented and so sure of herself and yet at the same time so awkward. Michael Nyqvist portrays Mikael Blomkvist with an air of confidence and authority that is just fitting for the character. We can understand why Salander not big on trust eventually warms up to him. If Salander is the loose cannon then he is the straight arrow that holds the film together.As a fan of the book I believe this adaptation was able to give sufficient justice. Like in all adaptations many elements of the story were changed. However most of these changes were done for a smoother flow and for a more viewerfriendly experience.Later this year David Fincher will be making a Hollywood version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Even with stars Daniel Craig and Robin Wright attached to the project it must pack a wallop so they can surpass the high standard that this Swedish production has set. Truly this film has made me want to venture more into European cinema and find all the wonders it has to offer.The Verdict The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a dark gritty excellentlydone crime drama that others will try to emulate but probably won't be able to. That being said it is not for everyone and not for the faint of heart. There is a reason that this is Rated R. The movie is very long compared to the running time of most movies coming out recently. Thus in order to fully enjoy and appreciate this gem one must be patient. Everything shall fall into place and in the end you will discover that it was one of the best ways to spend 150 minutes of your time. Trust me when I say that watching the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an intelligent heartwrenching unforgettable experience.".

Of course when the film in question is based on a bestselling novel nay the most profitable book in Northern Europe it's a whole different thing partly because of the unique circumstances surrounding its inception the author was a journalist who wrote fiction just for fun and died shortly after submitting the final version of the manuscripts Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy has shocked and enthralled readers all over the world which explains why the adaptation of the first chapter Men Who Hate Women retitled The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in Englishspeaking countries has become the most successful Swedish movie of all time. That and the fact that it's a very good film.Not surprisingly the main character is like the late author an investigative reporter a man in his late forties named Mikael Blomkvist Michael Nyqvist. Sentenced to a sixmonth stint in prison for allegedly forging evidence against a powerful businessman he wrote about in the magazine Millennium hence the trilogy's title he still has the time to carry out an assignment handed to him by one Henrik Vanger SvenBertil Taube to find out what happened on the day Vanger's niece Harriet disappeared. Dis she simply vanish or was she murdered? As the plot thickens Mikael receives unexpected help from Lisbeth Salander Noomi Rapace a young hacker with a troubled past and continued problems with her legal status more specifically her sleazy guardian.In the transition from page to screen some elements had to be abandoned obviously gone are the data on abused women that opened each section of the book the major contribution of Larsson's journalistic side as well as the sly references to past detective story staples Blomkvist and Vanger mention Agatha Christie when discussing their investigation. In terms of plot on the other hand the adaptation process is worthy of L.A. Confidential no unnecessary subplots do we really need to see Mikael sleeping with half the women he encounters? or irrelevant side characters just Blomkvist and Salander an odd investigative couple whose essence is best summed up by Mikael's line You know everything about me and I don't know sht about you.. It's that kind of weird humor spoken in plain brutal Swedish that gives the film its heart along with a decent dose of mystery.The Scandinavian landscape has its part in guaranteeing the story's success too like in the wonderful Let the Right One In the cold snowy environment provides the ideal backdrop for one of the most chilling pun not intended and grisly tales of murder ever committed to film. Staying true to the book's bleak core the violence is depicted without many restrictions especially in the central rape scene that justifies the original Swedish title and sets The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo aside from the majority of Hollywood's sanitized thrillers.In short this is a riveting rewarding experience. Needless to say an American version is already in the works to please subtitleweary moviegoers. It's not necessarily a bad idea look at what Chris Nolan did with Insomnia originally a Norwegian picture but can there really be a Tinseltown actress brave  and good  enough to take over from the mesmerizing Noomi Rapace? Well at least she still has two more films to steal before that happens...8510".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a grim and gritty tale lightened somewhat by an upbeat ending. Its origins as the first novel in the millennium series by Stieg Larrson is evident in a somewhat meandering storyline and a running time of two and a half hours with the inevitable excisions from the book. Nevertheless the film stands up well on its own.Sweden seems to produce detectives at the end of their tethers Wallander for example and the protagonist here Mikael a journalist starts out facing three months in jail for defaming a shonky business tycoon. I thought criminal defamation was a thing of the past but not it seems in Sweden. Mikael has been set up but the case has brought him to the notice of Henrick Vander the patriarch of an old industrial family who commissions Mikael to investigate the disappearance of his favourite niece who disappeared from the family's island retreat nearly 40 years ago. Mikael joins forces with the tiny but intimidating Lisbeth an ace computer hacker with a dark past and an agenda of her own.They soon discover that the Vander family except for their client who is a nice old gent are as about a dysfunctional a family as you might ever meet on a par with the Essenbecks of Visconti's The Damned. There are skeletons everywhere not just in the closet. However Mikael and Lisbeth crack the case after the usual quota of menacing moments and dashing around chasing red herrings and actual clues. Filmed in the midst of a Swedish winter the atmosphere is pretty gloomy not to mention just plain cold.Michael Nyqvist inhabits the role of Mikael pretty comfortably spending quite a lot of time looking surprised but Nooni Rapace as Lisbeth is something else again  practically an elemental force  never was someone so vulnerable and so dangerous at the same time.Nitpickers will be delighted to learn that in a short sequence set in outback northern Australia Mikael's FWD has the correct licence plates and its steering wheel on the right. However the lighting was most peculiar and the sheep a bit out of place  you mostly see cattle in northern Australia.There are apparently two sequels in the pipeline and despite some rather grisly moments I will line up to see them. Larrson who died suddenly after producing three bestsellers was a good storyteller and the filmmakers have executed the adaptation with plenty of skill.".

Wealthy tycoon Henrik Vanger hires controversial journalist Mikael Blomkvist to investigate disappearance of his niece which happened 40 years ago on the island wholly owned by Vanger family. Blomkvist was sentenced to three months in prison for planted libel against corrupt entrepreneur so Vanger decides to investigate him before hiring. Lisabeth Salander gets the job of investigating Blomkvist but she continues to monitor his computer after the job was done. So after she sees his new job for Vanger she starts helping him firstly indirectly and soon directly. Their investigation leads to revelations of dark secrets Vanger family. Although plot is relatively simple characterization of main characters is thorough which is not strange since this movie is just first in trilogy. In simple words movie is very good without both positively and negatively extremes. Perhaps some viewers will not like politicking and the story certainly could pass without the Nazis but all in all screenplay seems solid. Acting is at a high level and there are no big objections on directing. Noomi Rapace that embodies Lisbeth is fantastic but the rest of the cast is not far away. Perhaps the most remarkable is the atmosphere which is a typical Scandinavian strong cold and dark and it suits to story perfectly. The very end is a typical Hollywood and serious viewers will probably feel bitterness because the story had great potential to go in a more interesting and original way.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always been cautious about seeing Swedish films made in the last 3040 years. The reason is thatunlike America Britain Germany China Mexico Italy or Australiathere is almost no controversy over who is Sweden's greatest filmmaker. And thus nearly every Swedish film I've ever seen not directed by Ingmar Bergman has either been a ripoff of the great man's work or just shallow trash. Substitute Kurosawa for Bergman and you'll know why I also tend to avoid Japanese cinema. Nonetheless I kept hearing about this film and the book that inspired it. As a lover of mystery novels and film noir I decided that I need to at least give this movie a chance. And I'm glad I did. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo owes almost nothing to Bergman and everything to the novels of Raymond Chandler Dashiell Hammett and Ross McDonald.It begins when a sickly elderly billionaire industrialist who knows better than to trust his awful family wants to investigate the 42yearold disappearance of his niecethe only relative he ever loved think The Big Sleep. Through intermediaries he hires Lisbeth Salander Noomi Rapacea hackerprivate investigator with a troubled past and a large dragon tattoo on her back. Her assignment is to vet disgraced leftist journalist Mikael Blomqvist Michael Nyqvist to see if he's up to the job. Eventually Blomqvist agrees to do the job and quickly realizes that he needs Lisbeth to help him. Revealing much more of the plot would be unfair.Aside from the serpentine plot involving Nazis serial killers and a clandestine romance the thing I liked most about this movie was Rapace's performance as the inscrutable Lisbeth. Maybe there's a pattern here or maybe it's just me butalong with Kristen Stewart in The Runawaysmy two favorite female performances of 2010 thus far have been portrayals of angry leatherjacketed bisexual young women. Without changing facial expressions Rapace is somehow able to show anger fear love sadness and embarrassment at the appropriate times. And I feel the scene where Lisbeth is raped by her parole officer ranks just as high if not higher than the scene in The Accused that won Jodie Foster her first Oscar.According to this site there is already an American remake in the works. I don't know how that's going to work. Parts of the plot are fairly Eurocentric i.e. jailtime for libel a local Nazi movement run by Hitler himself. Plus the film retains novelist Stieg Larsson's radical anticapitalist antigovernment views which most Americans would find unpalatable.The future of Swedish cinema rests on movies from that country being watchable without giving up their artistic merit. Swedish filmmakers need to step outside the notion of becoming the next Bergman because there will only ever be one Bergman. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a great first step along that path.".

Events that Jeff alone chooses the outcomes of.Sequel to sequel these movies have progressed dramatically. Two ways would be the creativity and the gore. We don't pull any punches this year. We start it with a kick in the balls and end it with a kick in the balls. Darren Bousman. Traps weapons and devices now include chains bombs acid skin rippers ice pig guts guns and a very creative and sickly disturbing trap called the rack. It is similar to the previous sequel Saw II but Saw III has even more scenes that will make you cringe or moan in disgust.Unlike the subpar acting of Saw this time around it was phenomenal. When more characters were explained you got a good feel for the decisions they made and why the story ended up the way it did. Tobin Bell did yet another extraordinary job with his role as Jigsaw possibly making Jigsaw one of the most deranged and creative villains ever to step foot in a horror movie. Not only were there many fresh faces in Saw III but some characters made a return. I wouldn't want to spoil it for you but like Darren said it kicks you in the balls I would say pretty hard.Overall this movie was great but for some reason it didn't completely blow me away like Saw and Saw II did. Many stones were left unturned which always means that there could be yet another sequel and the ending happened too suddenly. Will there be a Saw IV? Maybe maybe not.

It's a rule of the series by now that a Saw movie must include a lot of gory deaths as well as an unexpected twist at the end. While the first thing isn't so hard to come up with  and the makers definitely do a fine job thinking of the sickest bloodiest deaths possible  it's the twist that seems more forced with each entry in the franchise. It's a disadvantage that we know for a fact a surprise is coming. What's worse is that in Saw III the final twist doesn't resolve a question we've been asking ourselves during the whole movie. No it's question and answer in one and that doesn't make it particularly interesting. It's just a lot of explaining over some annoyingly edited flashbacks.Speaking of flashbacks there are way too many in this movie. We see things that we really never needed to see. Loose ends are tied up that aren't actually loose ends. It's like the writers read too many threads on the IMDb message boards for the previous movies and decided to spell out everything that has been ambiguous until now to put an end to all discussions once and for all. It only goes to show that those things were a lot more intriguing when they were left in the dark.Jigsaw himself won't ever keep his mouth shut in this movie. The guy has thought of many cruel traps but his constant blabbering is his most sadistic device. He's already been overexposed in part 2 and this entry in the series continues to make that mistake. After the revelation about his identity at the end of the original there really weren't too many mysteries surrounding him anymore but part 3 still tries to come up with some mainly about his relationship to his accomplice. Again this is unnecessary and not very interesting information.Considering how quickly the Saw movies have been made it's a little miracle that they still turned out to be quite entertaining. However one wonders if the franchise couldn't be better if a bit more time was spent on developing the sequels. The production values in particular could use some improvement. The make up looks fine but the stage design makes both sequels look like an episode of Star Trek.So yes Saw III is as fast paced as its predecessors and the gruesome torture scenes don't disappoint. See it if you're looking for mindless fun but don't expect it to knock you off your feet the way the original did. Apparently part 4 is already in the works. Now that's just going to be a waste of time as Saw III already ends the series. Guess Hollywood never learns. Halloween anyone?".

	schema:headline " Twisted Unrealistic and Repulsive  Pathetic";
	schema:reviewBody "A few things about this whole Saw series that I hate 1. The repulsive attempt to support the belief that Jigsaw is not a murderer  in all these movies. Unfortunately some people believe in this nonsense which is enough to convince me that in these days many people's minds are simply warped and rotten beyond understanding.2. The claim of these movies that Jigsaw is just trying to help people and all the folks simply cannot make use of the great chance they were given. Yeah it is a piece of cake to cut through your eye and look for whatever is hidden in your flesh if you have as much time as one minute. I must also admit that it is a good way to teach somebody not to sham illness and skip work by covering him in flammable substance poisoning him giving him a candle to look for something not really possible to find Mark Rodriguez in Saw.3. I also hate the whole attempt to present the plot of this disastrous trilogy as something really realistic and possible. From what I have read I can conclude that there are dozens of things in all the three movies that clearly show that it is all based on the audience's lack of specialist knowledge e.g. technical or medical knowledge and uncritical reception of what is shown. Do not understand me wrong I do not want to slate e.g. a fantasy novel just because I do not believe in magic but because e.g. no character should be too exempt from the rules that apply to others. I can tolerate that in some movies characters do pretty impossible things but that is the convention of some genres. However Saw tries to present Jigsaw as some genius whose work is perfect. However if there is to be no flaw every detail of the story should be preceded by research by the 8222Saw crew.4. Especially low primitive and disgusting is this showing every possible detail  severed limbs and the trapped people agony. Particularly shocking was the last scene of Saw 3  the disfigured corpse of Lynn. Why is it shown? Certainly for gruesome entertainment of numerous freaks because a moment before we can see Jeff turning his head from the shotgun collar blast which clearly tells us that the trap worked. Choosing somebody's corpse without head for the last thing we see in a film is utterly devoid of any sense or aesthetic value. Moreover it is obvious that something unshown unknown and unexplained unexplained but not illogical  is much more scary and fascinating than something fully visible and plain e.g. the thing killing people in Stephen King's short story 8222Raft. It proves what the purpose of Saw 3 and the two other movies of the cycle is to get as many people to the cinema as possible. I would not be so critical of these movies if they were just slashers but they pretend to be something more.To conclude this trilogy is a cheap way for some people to get a lot of cash and media attention".

	onyx:emotionText "A few things about this whole Saw series that I hate 1. The repulsive attempt to support the belief that Jigsaw is not a murderer  in all these movies. Unfortunately some people believe in this nonsense which is enough to convince me that in these days many people's minds are simply warped and rotten beyond understanding.2. The claim of these movies that Jigsaw is just trying to help people and all the folks simply cannot make use of the great chance they were given. Yeah it is a piece of cake to cut through your eye and look for whatever is hidden in your flesh if you have as much time as one minute. I must also admit that it is a good way to teach somebody not to sham illness and skip work by covering him in flammable substance poisoning him giving him a candle to look for something not really possible to find Mark Rodriguez in Saw.3. I also hate the whole attempt to present the plot of this disastrous trilogy as something really realistic and possible. From what I have read I can conclude that there are dozens of things in all the three movies that clearly show that it is all based on the audience's lack of specialist knowledge e.g. technical or medical knowledge and uncritical reception of what is shown. Do not understand me wrong I do not want to slate e.g. a fantasy novel just because I do not believe in magic but because e.g. no character should be too exempt from the rules that apply to others. I can tolerate that in some movies characters do pretty impossible things but that is the convention of some genres. However Saw tries to present Jigsaw as some genius whose work is perfect. However if there is to be no flaw every detail of the story should be preceded by research by the 8222Saw crew.4. Especially low primitive and disgusting is this showing every possible detail  severed limbs and the trapped people agony. Particularly shocking was the last scene of Saw 3  the disfigured corpse of Lynn. Why is it shown?

	schema:reviewBody "Saw was a smash hit at the box office for a few reasons. First James Wan is a fantastic visionary director. He manages to tell the story build suspense scare the crap out of the audience when necessary but best of all like any GOOD horror film the viewer is strung out waiting for the next twist. The ending is so awesome we finally get to see who Jigsaw really is and it's the last person anyone expects we even see John earlier in the film in a hospital bed but NO ONE could ever have suspected... The film wasn't even wellacted but the STORY and the way the story unfurled was genius. Danny Glover and his search for Jigsaw clue by clue is what really sells everything home. By the end we want to know who Jigsaw is worse then the men chained in the basement. When we find out the truth it is so satisfying. That is a what a GOOD movie does.Saw II brought aboard a novice director and it becomes obvious that plot was taking a backseat to gore. Not particularly surprising for a sequel but disappointing nonetheless. Darren Lynn Bousman tried as hard as he could to bring back the feel of Saw but with Jigsaw having been caught so early in the film Saw II lacks the sense of mystery and suspense that Saw brilliantly maintains from start to finish. Bousman uses the same seizureinducing editing but it is not as welldone nor is the movie really scary at any point. At least the game that goes on throughout the movie is interesting and the twist at the end is enough to satisfy the viewer.Saw III is a rush job. The script was written in a week! That should tell you everything you need to know. The traps are gory as hell but the brilliant moral lessons behind the traps are completely gone. The game that Jeff plays really only has 3 or 4 parts and nothing comes out of any part of it. Jeff himself is never in any immediate danger so there is no sense of urgency to the film. The brain surgery scene is totally pointless it serves no purpose other than to gross people out and it isn't even done well. At no point during this film was I even remotely afraid. Darren Lynn Bousman tries soooo hard to direct as crisply as James Wan did but he ends up reusing footage over and over and he totally fails to reproduce the feel of Saw. The editing tries to duplicate what made Saw so good but it falls flat and feels completely forced. There is no suspense no climax almost no notable parts and there are very few surprises. The best part of the whole franchise Jigsaw Tobin Bell is stuck in a bed and his awesome performance definitely does not make up for this film's lack of...everything. The ending is just as anemic as the film itself. I was completely and utterly disappointed with how this film turned out. You simply cannot make a good movie if you completely disregard the need for PLOT and CHARACTERS. Darren Lynn Bousman close but no cig...uh wait it wasn't even close! If this series continues they need to bring Wan back and they need to do a prequel so that we can see Jigsaw the only saving grace of the Saw movies at his finest and not in a damn bed.".

As a horror fan knowing what i know about the genre this movie is just meant to shock people. The situations the people are put in are not clever and they are elaborate and ridiculous. They explain why the murders seem to be pointless in the movie later but it still doesn't make it any more entertaining. The most gruesome part is when one character performs surgery on Jigsaw. Horror fans don't go see this movie unless you're in a bad mood and want to have something to complain about. For everyone else it may provide some gross stuff to make you a little squirmy but thats about it. It hasn't got a clever twist at the end like the first two. The second movie was bad but at least it had a fun twist at the end.".

This movie is too predictable. There's a little twist at the end but nothing like the surprises at the end of the first two. The whole plot deals with Amanda but Jigsaw is the real star of the series. The fact that he is an ancillary character just ruins it for me. The final sequence is terrible and predictable. You should probably see it just for the sake of completeness but it's easily the worst of the 3 movies and is a shameful end to the trilogy.".

He takes people who have some sort of problem note the word problem is very loosely adapted in these films  according to jigsaw a woman who is having marital problems needs to go through a deathtrap and tries to help them heal themselves.Makes sense?? Not really but I will go with it anyways. In Saw III the FINAL trap involves 4 people including Jigsaw but is really that crazy girl's game even though she is Jigsaw's sidekick. OK so Jigsaw says that he despises murderers. Really Jigsaw?? Well you just included two innocent people in one of your games to teach some crazy drugaddict a lesson about anger management.The one guy's problem he was upset that his son was killed in an accident.His wife's problem her marriage went sour after the accident occurred and she was having an affair. Both seem pretty innocent to me. But wait they need to learn a lesson. I know it is just a movie but the series has really lost its way from the original script. Saw 1 was not a good movie. It had horrible acting. BUT it had a decent script and a pretty good story line.Now the Saw series is about the producers or screenwriters whoever thinks up this crap thinking up 4 or 5 deathtraps and then later filling in some lame story line. What we are left with is still horrible acting except now an equally bad storyline.Think its time to put this puppy to bed Saw creators".

So then I knew there had to be a final installment and man! I must say they brought it!! From beginning to end this movie shapes up in true SAW fashion for a finish thats completely unexpected. I know its hard to give a movie a 10 but The simple fact is this is the first horror thrillogy thats worked for all 3 movies. Congrats to the creators and cast you guys have a made a classic thrillogy thats gonna be hard to beat for a long time to come.".

The problem some directors feel is that we are so desensitized to what we have seen in recent horror films that we must up the violence gore and grotesque to limits never before seen in cinema.With the exception of a wonderful scene in the beginning with Donnie Wahlberg there is no artistic value to anything shown in the movie Saw III and I feel like a worse person after seeing it. There is no reason to see it unless you are a sadist or feel the need to impress yourself for how much you can take. This movie is an excersise in physical tolerance not mental. Instead of covering your eyes in fear you will turn away in disgust. It is nothing but a snuff movie with a budget filmed by people who used to get arrested for charging people to see it.I have nothing against horror movies or gore or violence or the grotesque. I do however when it is done without any artistic reason whatsoever. The gore in this movie is not done to scare. What Tobe Hooper knew when he directed the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is that no matter what you show no matter how violent you can make a film nothing is scarier than the imagination.There is a very scary scene in Saw III with a naked woman hanging from a hook by a rope tied around her hands. She is in a giant freezer and water eventually sprays at her freezing her body. It is a brilliant creative and horrifying method of death but the problem is the way it is shot. The movie has absolutely no problem showing this woman's naked body in the full hanging screaming and being sprayed with ice water as she pleads for help.What have we come to? Why must we see her privates? There is nothing artistic or erotic in this scene and it made me more afraid of what the director does behind private doors than of the main villain Jigsaw.".

It was nice to see all the missing pieces pardon the pun from all of Jigsaw's schemes but the whole Amanda thing really bothered me. I found that the Saw makers really screwed up with bringing Amanda into the story. I LOVED when Donnie Eric Matthews commented on how she is NOTHING which I completely agree with. She is just some whiny little girl who Jigsaw should have finished off. He gave her a chance he tested her again huge spoiler!!! and I just find her character to be weak. I am not sure if it was the character or the actress but I found it to be a really bad part of the story. Okay it was a mind boggler to find out in part 2 that she was his accomplice. I found it ironic that she was cutting herself and doing drugs Jigsaw chose her she got out of the trap gets a second chance and screws it up big time by cutting herself and NOT listening to her mentor. Way to screw up big time Amanda. I found the end was really weak and predictable with no second guesses. People were actually booing it in the theater myself included. If you can piece together how Jigsaw performedset up all of his traps from the first 2 movie that's all that Saw 3 pieces together and also seems like it has cheap clips from E.R. hahaha! If you want to see how it ends go ahead but wait until it comes out on video. I hate to betray the franchise I am a huge fan of 1 and 2 but I am just really let down by this movie. Sorry to those who are fans. Oh one more thing some of the flashbacks take place maybe 2 minutes after something just happened which seems retarded.".

The stage show is my all time favorite Broadway show and I was a bit nervous as to how Phantom and the music of the night would hold up on the big screen but I needn't have worried because it was very definitely worth the price of the ticketand then some.The movie for the most part retains much of the stage show I'd say about 85 percent true to the show though there were slight differences. The magic present in the show live is still for the most part here on film. In fact I was wondering if I would cry during the movie and of coarse I did. Phantom of the Opera's's loveliness is still so luminous and the movie just fills your senses. I don't think there was a sound in the theater during the whole movie.The film's lookamong the most riveting I've ever seencolorful rich and oozing vibrancy the look and feel are just magnificent. I sure hope this movie wins some awards for it's costumes and Cinematography. At times there was almost a bit TO much going on which as my friends and I discussed takes the focus away from the music a bit and maybethough I'm torn on this they should have toned it down just a tiny tiny bit. Still the look was so spectacular I'm not even sure I'd definitely have done that myself. But still 10 of 10 for atmosphere.The castingpretty good for the most part. I simply cannot believe Emmy Rossum is only 18 years old she is magnificent and I am in awe of her. She was a beautiful lovely Christine and I think we'll be seeing a lot of her in the future.Gerard Butler has been getting some flack. I actually liked him in the role of the phantom although I began to feel more strongly about his rightness as the movie went on not right at the beginning. That is not because he wasn't good in the role just different then the stage version. To me his singing got more and more soulful as the movie went on and his acting was an A plus he wasn't just there to sing and look pretty he acted the heck out of the role and succeeded in elevating the phantom from just a presence to a tortured individual. People have been saying he's to good looking well that's certainly not his fault!though they really could have gotten a more realistic looking mask for him to wear. And besides his looks are transcended by the end they lose their focus until we are barely aware of them. He did a really good job. Patrick Wilson surprised me the most I think in a way I enjoyed his voice the most. He was simply Superb and he too embodied Raoul. He is a talented actor with a moving gently powerful voice and he was great. Minnie Driver Miranda Richarardsonall great. Good casting choices.All in all a great night at the moviesI am giving this a 9 and I think if I had to say why it's not a perfect 10 it's just that this story was meant to first be a theatrical production and as good as the movie was and as many tears as I cried it did not haunt me in the same way as the stage show. That does not take away from the movie's power or magnificence I'm not even sure it could have been any better at all as a movie. It's just that seeing it live sends chills down my spine and haunts in a way that only a stage musical can do. I can actually understand how some people are not impressed by Phantom because the bottom line is this is as much about the music as the story and if one isn't a fan of this type of music one probably won't simply find a lot here. But for those who have seen the beauty of Phantom on stage they'll probebly love it and better yet for those lucky enough to come into this film and love it WITHOUT having ever seen the playsee the playbecause if you think the movie version is the stuff that magnificence is made of think about all that live on stage right in front of you. This movie is good and I admiringly give it a 9 of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "So I usually don't qualify my reviews but this movie is sort of special and the comments I've read are from all over the map so I feel I should give some idea of where I'm coming from too. I've been an playwrite actor and director for years with work of mine have been doing both domestically and internationally and having appeared in plays both amateur and professional and every level in between including a professional opera and many a musical whenever I watch anything I approach it on three levels artist critic and audience. Also I grew up seeing shows on Broadway both megamusicals and little indy plays in the Village and while generally speaking my tastes lean more towards arty and indy I do have a broader pallet and it would be more accurate to say that my real interest is piqued by anything that is genuinely good at being what it is which is one way of describing Phantom of the Opera. Because yes it's not as complec and intelligent as the work of Sondheim or Kander and Ebb but for what it sets out to be an enthralling and absorbing Gothic romance a genre that is rarely done well on stage let alone as a musical it achieves on every level the score which is soaring and crashing and large just like the emotions of the characters who sing it the design ornate and overwhelming and grand guigol to the hilt the story which is totally ridiculous on some level but since gothicism and romance are both genres which celebrate the extremes of our minds and imaginations this is totally appropriate. Phantom is a brilliant example of art where the content and the style of the rendering of that content fit each other to a tea and while it may not be YOUR cup of tea I sort of feel that anyone who thinks it's crap has basically missed the point or is just sour grapes because the thing is so damn popular and so damn good at being what it is and lets face it it's hard not to resent a success sometimes. Genius is often ridiculed especially genius of an unusual nature or in a somewhat unconventional field and Gothic romance be it novel film or musical is looked down on in general usually for the very qualities that make it interesting and Webber's work is genius because Phantom is for all its faults tightly written a brilliant balance of camp melodrama satire and fairy tale and while the style of music might not work for each listener it effectively illuminates the story and conveys what is most important about the characters their titantic albeit somewhat simpleminded emotions desires fears and obsessions.SPOILERSThe movie in my opinion takes what is best about the play and does it even better. Though some of my favorite bits from the stage show the rehearsal of Don Jaun where the piano plays itself Raoul's part in Wondering Child are gone they have been dropped in favor of brilliant improvements namely having the chandelier crash at the conclusion of the film it really brings the whole thing full circle and allowing more glimpses of Paris 1917 finally explaining why it is Raoul returns what happens to the Phantom etc. Other good bits that we see now but never saw onstage an affectionate moment between Meg and Madame Giry some history of the Phantom a deeper sense of what Meg may know or not know about the Phantom's presence the stalking of Josephe Bouquet the life of the underclass of the opera house the Hall of Mirrors from the book etc. Also the music has been beautifully reorchestrated and never sounded better. I'll take orchestra over canned synths any day thank you.The cinematography is beautiful and the opera moments are well done complete with the cornball almost intrusive dancing and vibrant but totally unrealistic sets and costumes that characterized grand opera at the time. The sense of constant claustrophobia back stage is great and adds to that sense of what it was like to live and work in this tiny world where everyone is a performer and half your wardrobe comes from the costume department did anyone else catch that moment where Christine takes her dress from the wardrobe? adding to the central question at Phantom's core what who is real and what who is an illusion and is real preferable to illusion or vicevera? The bleedingly bright colors and deep shadows of the movie help echo all of this reminding us always this story is not real hero on white charger and all but we don't want it to be it's a legend it's a fairy tale it's a farce... it's a masquerade. It's as the Auctioneer says a strange affair. Phantom told and acted realistically totally wouldn't work so don't ask it to or judge it that way.The best thing about this movie is the performances and the director has done a wonderful thing by moving AWAY from Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman both of whom gave role defining performances neither of which are any more correct than any other. The question isn't are Butler and Rossum as good as their predecessors but rather do their versions of the characters work and the answer is yes. Return to Phantom as a text not as a show with a history and you'll see that Christine is supposed to be dreamy lost emotionally unstable and young just as Rossum plays and sings the role. Butler with his harsher singing and deeper range is much more believable as a madman who is sometimes pathetic and pitable but still ultimately a deranged egomaniac who lives underground and makes wax statues of the woman he loves. The rest of the cast is equally good with Minnie Driver giving a heroically hysterical performance Jennifer Ellison combining strength and curiosity with innocence and a certain grounded quality I've always believed the audience is ultimately supposed to identify with Meg who is the only character who never panics and maintains a healthy sense of reality that contrasts nicely with Rossum's morbid dreaminess and Patrick Wilson doing much more with Raoul than any of the actors I've seen on stage. I wish Simon Callow had had more to do but such is life at least he was there. Miranda Richardson continues to prove she can play anything and conveying more with a look than most actresses can with a full script of dialogue. Her accent is totally brilliant it sets her apart makes her glamorous and mysterious and at the same time is another sly tongue in cheek reminder that what we are watching should only be believed to a point it is after all just another version of beauty and the beast.".

	schema:headline " Absolutely fantastic!";
	schema:reviewBody "I dragged my long suffering boyfriend to see The Phantom of the Opera on Sunday and was pleasantly surprised by it. Although I have never seen it onstage the film version  for me  was so enchanting that I now cannot wait to obtain tickets to it. The sets were absolutely beautiful. France is known for its beauty and this adaption certainly paid homage to that. The theatre set itself was absolutely stunning marble and velvet being the main materials within it. Emmy Rossum Christine was 17 when this was filmed and was absolutely outstanding. When she started to sing my mouth literally dropped open. Minnie Driver La Carlotta was very funny in her Italian diva role. Her hand gestures added to the mannerisms of a typical diva. Her singing was overdone to add to the character even though Ms. Driver did not do all the vocals herself. Patrick Wilson Raoul out of all of them had the most captivating voice. Although Raoul seemed a bit wet and droopy he was still gorgeous and made the GIRLS in the audience swoon. However the star of the piece for me was Gerard Butler the Phantom. Although his vocal skills weren't entirely right for the part he portrayed the Phantom as a lot of people see him as a victim. I actually ended up warming to him and when asked by my boyfriend who I would choose Raoul or the Phantom I said the Phantom. Something about the way Mr. Butler played him was so sexy and he drew the WOMEN to him. Watching the Phantom and Raoul certainly separated the boys from the men and the girls from the women. Another pleasant surprise is that Jennifer Ellison was actually rather good in her role as Meg Christine's best friend. Miss Ellison has been trained in acting singing and dancing and so was well equipped to the play the part and carried it off very well. I wouldn't be surprised if more roles in Hollywood turned up for her. Overall I rate this film a 55 and definitely recommend it. It sent shivers up my spine and gave me goosebumps. I urge those of you who haven't seen it to become goosebump friendly by watching THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA!".

	schema:headline " Stunning!!! Magnificent!!! Powerful!!! Beautiful Sexy and Tragically Heartbreaking";
	schema:reviewBody "I can't believe I waited so long to see this movie. I've never seen the stage play. I lived in L.A. for about 17 years attended acting school and performed in some musicals before but was never that crazy about seeing them so I really didn't know what to expect. I thought Chicago was okay. I went to see it on a whim. But when that chandelier went up and the sweeping transformation happened to the opera house from black and white dusty ruin to a lush landscape of red velvet and gold ornate statues to the equal sweep of that unimaginably beautiful music I literally forgot to breathe. Every time I see it I still get goosebumps. You feel that you've just been magically transported to another world. I loved every frame every note every performance from the very beginning to the very end. The critics must be crazy. This movie should be up for every award ever made!! I can't stop watching it. I've seen it ten times already and can't wait for the next time. It's definitely now in my top ten of all time. Joel Schumacher and Andrew Lloyd Webber have created a MASTERPIECE!!!What can I say about the performances that hasn't been said they were superb. Emmy Rossum was innocent beautiful and angelic with a voice to match. Patrick Wilson was perfect as Raoul handsome and with a voice as smooth as silk. However I can't say enough about Gerard Butler. His emotional range is absolutely stunning. Not since Richard Burton or Larry Olivier in Richard III have I seen an actor who can encompass so many different levels on the turn of a dime Murderous rage intense sexuality and longing incredible vulnerability. I can't believe the comments I've seen on his singing. His voice was beautiful sensuous and the amazing thing was his singing matched every emotion he was feeling from highest to lowest. In the beginning we see a very confident strong domineering individual partial to strangling people when cornered not the most sympathetic of individuals who nevertheless shows a sensitivity and sweetness despite all of his extremely fatal faults that is in the more than competent hands of Gerard Butler. His performance is so beautifully and deftly drawn that gradually by the end of the film we see what's been behind the mask all along He's just a lost little boy who never grew up. I also have to comment on the Point of No Return number. That has got to be the sexiest scene I've EVER seen. And neither of them lost a stitch of clothing. Well accept maybe a cape and a mask. But I digress. I'm sorry but I would have dropped Raoul like a hot potato just to lie in that swan bed and let him sing to me ALLLL day and ALLLL night among other things.....use your imagination. So he lived in a sewer and had a little anger management problem. We could have worked through it with a good therapist. I mean this guy gave Christine what every hot blooded woman wants Total and obedient worship. Am I right girls? Anyway to all you naysayers I say this movie would have been nothing without him. To tell you the truth I kept wondering Who is this guy where did he come from? So I did what the rest of you do and looked him up on imdb. I'd seen Dracula 2000 and Timeline but I didn't recognize him at all. Since then I've seen his other film roles to be honest the films weren't that great but that's not his fault. You've got to take what you're offered. So I just have to note another of his astonishing talents I swear he changes with every role. His voice and his face even his body molds to whatever character he's playing. I cannot believe that he is not up for Best Actor or that this film is not up for at least ten Oscars. Incidentally I shall be boycotting them this year and I urge you to do the same. Compared to this film the rest is just drivel. Anyway Mr. Butler is an amazing actor. I'm so glad Mr. Schumacher had the tremendous insight to cast him. I hope now he will get the roles he so richly deserves. I'd pay admission to watch that man walk across the street. I can't believe he'd never had a voice lesson before. I hope he does more recording. I still can't get those songs out of my head got the CD and still can't stop playing it. To all those spoil sports GET OVER IT!! This is a MOVIE it's not the stage play. You must embrace it on it's own turf. And WHAT a movie I can't wait to purchase the DVD so I can savor it like the finest wine that it is to my hearts content. If you haven't seen it yet you've missed something extremely special. It's one of the finest and most beautiful films ever made.I have to thank you imdb at least we for once get a chance to air our opinions. I will never see another movie without consulting my fellow little people again. Thank you so much for this opportunity.".

	schema:headline " A visual and sensual feast!!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "We had seen only the original silent movie not the stage play or even the soundtrack before going. So we knew not what to expect. But at the very opening as the longdead chandelier rises to life swinging in what seems like one endless arc and scatters the colour of memories about as it flames back to life and the theatre is washed in colour and majesty not seen in decades... we both knew this was going to be good. And it was. When it comes to sets scenery and cinematography they spared no expense. Every scene is drenched in rich detail. At the risk of sounding the heretic I must say that a movie version removes the limitations of space and time to set up the stage and so has the upper hand in the scenery and sets department. Some of these shots must have taken weeks to compose and I'm glad they invested the time. The music is just wonderful. I'd dare say that even if you are not a musical fan if you are at least romantically inclined you will LOVE this movie. By the end of some songs like All I ask of you I'm restraining myself from singing the song out loud with them! The movie kind of departs from the setting of the original silent movie in which the Phantom is actually quite hideous. This Phantom is more mysterious than hideous. But the attraction between him and Christine is pure raw sensual. I mean it borders on erotic it's so strong. During Past the point of no return I'm sitting there with my wife literally falling under the spell myself. Yea... maybe she should be with this guy after all... But that's the whole point. She WAS influenced by him and he did cast a strong spell and he was very alluring. The movie made it so real I was beginning to feel it myself. Some people have derided Gerard Butler's performance. Frankly I find his throaty sometimes raspy voice to be right on par. I heard so much ado about Michael Crawford that I went to Amazon and listened to some of his renditions of these songs. Verdict Give me Gerard Butler! His voice is masculine seductive and hypnotic. In the final verdict I find the movie versions of these songs to be FAR superiour to the Broadway versions. I say Bravo! to the selection of Gerard.Definitely worth seeing in a theatre if you can. Don't wait for the DVD. See it BIG and LOUD. My favs Masquerade! All I ask of you and Point of No Return. Wow... Point of no return had ME believing!!!!What raging passion floods the soulwhat rich desire unlocks its doorwhat sweet seduction lies before us ...past the point of no return...Oh yeah that's the stuff!".

The movie has such depth and rich details making it is worthy of spending the time and money to see it five times. Please spare me any more negative comments about Gerard Butler's performance! I have seen the play in New York and in a regional theater. Of all performances I have seen Gerard Butler's portrayal of the Phantom is the finest most sensitive and most provocative. His singing is full of emotion making his character believable and powerful. I would like to see Gerard Butler get some recognition for his performance because he lifts the character of the Phantom far beyond what it has been in the past. He was perfect for the role and his acting and singing should be recognized as one of the best performances on the screen this year! Emmy would not have been as great as she was without the performance provided by Gerard Butler. I want to thank Gerard Butler for taking me out of the everyday details of living into a world of music of the night. Speak out for Gerard Butler's receiving recogniton for his truly inspiring performance as the Phantom!".

Gerard Butler gives a particularly anguishing and sympathetic performance as The Phantom. Emmy Rossum is beautiful portraying Christine and her transformation from a young innocent to a woman who is aware of herself her sexuality and the world of love. Patrick Wilson is a particularly dashing heroic and protective Raoul and Minnie Driver provides hilarious comic relief as Carlotta. I particularly enjoyed the film's ability to delve deeper into the lives of characters. It provided depth and context and layers to all of the characters that the stage production cannot do. The entire cast was magnificent and I will be hearing the music of the night in my head for the next several days. I would definitely recommend it and can't wait to see it again.".

I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that she actually sings her role not many actors seem to do that even if they have a good voice.Gerard Butler as the role of the Phantom was also really good. The anger and loneliness surrounding him was heartbreaking as well as his emotions towards Christine. Gerard portrays all of the Phantom's qualities anger sadness loneliness genius madness and the list goes on better than one would hope.This movie is a must see and the soundtrack is a must have. There is a very good chance that I will see this movie again. This is one of those movies that should be viewed on the big screen first and not just on DVD or VHS.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Phantom of the Opera is of course a very well known story and has been adapted so many times that you would probably lose count if you tried. This of course is the musical adaptation if you may have not realized by now. Now if any part of your criticism of this film has to do with it being a musical then you probably didn't enjoy viewing it. I myself are in no way a fan of musicals but in this case I found the experience of watching this film to be extremely gratifying.For once I did not find myself feeling disgusted at the direction of Joel Schumacher. Joel Schumacher definitely handled this storyline with much more care then he has with other films throughout his career. Right from the opening minutes the film became extremely engaging and really never slows down. One thing for sure and most people would agree is that the set design and visual glamour of the film is astounding.Yet one aspect of the film that certainly has not caught on with everyone is the acting of Gerard Butler who plays the Phantom. Such criticisms as he is not scary at all or he is lacking in the area of singing. For me his singing did not bother me one bit and the fact of him not being scary enough is just ridiculous to fault him for that. This film is a musical not a horror movie. You simply can't expect a singing murderer to ever really be scary. If there is anyone to pick at for falling short it is Patrick Wilson. In my view he never presents anything unique or appealing in his performance. He in a way just seems to be just there. Emmy Rossum though certainly asserted her presence in the film. Her feelings as well as the Phantom's are always felt not despite the singing or music but rather with the help of it.Personally this is my favorite musical and I definitely recommend it even if you're not a fan of musicals. Keep in mind as I stated before there won't be much of a horror factor but that is not really the point. This is by all means a romance and tackles the theme of loneliness in a very touching poignant and compassionate way. The Phantom of the Opera is certainly gruesome but instead poetic.".

The lip sync hing is often poor especially in 'Think of Me' which is disappointing especially in the knowledge that all but Minnie Driver recorded their own singing parts anyway.The Soundtrack has been given a spring clean and it really benefits from it removing some of the synthesized feel of the original and giving it much more of an orchestral grandeur.All in all this film really took me by surprise.

From the black and white opening scene I knew it was going to be visually splendid and from the atmosphere created knew I was in for something dramatic. Then the theatre turned to colour and all was sent spinning back in time and the busy backstage frolics of the cast at the Opera House were bought to life. It was not apparent who the leading lady would be for a while until the chorus girl Christine was encouraged forward to sing replacing the Diva and was transformed from rags to a Cinderella style dress and sang with a pure beautiful voice and made me feel all magical and warm inside especially when she hit that note at the end!! Anyway the film went on and she was re united with her childhood sweetheart who was very charming and although most say wet I think was very caring and charming any girl wants prince charming on a white horse despite what they say  There were lots of dream like scenes to follow and the film heightened emotionally all the way to the end I've heard the song Wishing you were somehow here again but never knew its context but the song and scene merged beautifully together for a very sentimental moment in the film enhanced by the angel statues covered in misty snow and a very Tim Burton moment. The phantom was a mixture of angersadnessgenius and you could understand why Christine was very weak willed in his presence. I loved it saw it twice bought the soundtrack and rate it 9 out of 10. Karen Freddies girlfriend and he liked it too!".

I also can't believe it wasn't nominated for the OscarBest Picturebecause I truly believe it deserves it. What's wrong with Hollywood that they can't see a movie of such extraordinary quality? The music costumes acting and sets were gorgeous. The story was intense and multilayered to the max. They really pulled out all the stops on this one and went over the top but it really worked! It is such a classic 19th century fantasy with a heroine pursued by two amazing suitors! They don't make guys like that anymore! The Phantom was the most sublime artist ever georgeous guy that I'm sure lots of women would go crazy over! For me the genius of this movie was in the details. The subtle gestures and nuances of imagined touch between the Phantom and Cristine and between Cristine and Raoul. There's some truly extraordinary sexual vibes passing between Cristine and the Phantom when the Phantom leaps on stage and sings Past the Point of No Return with her. If they were really alive I'm sure they'd never forget it! I found this movie a million times sexier than 90 of the movies that are made that are suppose to be sexy!! I'm sure I won't see a movie like this again! Bravo!!!".

This one bears no resemblance to either version being a lavish vision of a Gothic romance but is still a stunning film which grew on me after the second more relaxed viewing free of prejudices and cynicism.I've never been one to like Joel Schumacher as a film director  nothing personal of course  but looking back at his filmography and seeing his incursions into the Gothic genre despite a lack of a trademark style I can see why he was a great choice for this film version. He stays as faithful to the stage version as possible as much as making his name in the credits an afterthought. His camera loves photographing everything and everyone it lays its eyes on and that is crucial in telling such an atmospheric tale.I don't think Schumacher made a casting mistake in having Gerard Butler Patrick Wilson and Emmy Rossum play the leads Butler's sad masculine beauty and piercing eyes bring forth his inner torture. Wilson while being the one who gets the girl is supposed to be the milquetoast and nothing else  it's been done since the beginning of filmmaking. Rossum is enchanting as Christine Vaae and benefits even more due to her young age where forbidden dark love would fit. An older woman would not work. And I loved Minnie Driver as Carlotta! What a diva.Somehow I believe the amount of negative reviews from established film critics is based on a preference to the Lon Chaney film. I don't believe this version should be made to measure against Chaney's  the styles are too dissimilar the former being a straightout horror classic and this being what it is an opera therefore high on emotion. Maybe time will grant ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER'S PHANTOM OF THE OPERA the cinematic value it has.".

	schema:headline " Wonderful stage to screen ADAPTATION";
	schema:reviewBody "I have capitalized the word ADAPTATION in my review title to emphasize the fact that this is a film interpretation of the stage show  not a direct imitation. People expecting to view an exact stage to screen version of this musical will probably be disappointed. HOWEVER if you are willing to watch this film with an open mind you will see that it is still the same story with the same wonderful music with only a few modifications. The biggest change was the decision to move the chandelier crash to the end of the film. In my opinion this was a smart move as it wouldn't make sense to have the climax of the story occur in the middle of the film. It works for the stage as it's an amazing end to the first act it gets everyone excited for the second half of the show. In a movie there is no intermission to separate the chandelier crash from Masquarade so it would be kaboom! chandelier crash wham! Masquarade  there's nowhere to go but down if the story is kept in the original order. Another change is the sword fight sequence which has been added to the graveyard scene. While I think the Phantom shooting fireballs in the movie would have been laughable it is slightly annoying that here Raoul has the chance to defeat the Phantom but doesn't  only to immediately sing about a plan to capture the Phantom. There was also the choice to speak some lines that were previously sung. I personally don't mind the changes in some ways I think it makes the meaning of those phrases stand out. In particular Christine and Raoul's part in Masquarade  to me the line it's an engagement not a crime seems more forceful when spoken.In regards to the actors Emmy Rossum while sometimes a little tight vocally has a clear sweet voice that is fitting for the age of the character which is only 16 years old. While I prefer the strength of Sarah Brightman's voice her overdone vibrato has always bothered me and in that respect Rossum is a breath of fresh air! Patrick Wilson shows why he was nominated for two Tony Awards his voice is melodic and beautiful. He also brings strength to a sometimes flimsy character.Gerard Butler is incredible! He has received a lot of harsh criticism for his voice but he freely admits that he's no Michael Crawford and that they were trying to make a different and darker version of the play. True his voice is rough but it is fitting for someone who can be murderously insane. If you listen carefully enough you can hear at the start of the movie his voice is softer kinder and smoother. As the movie progresses and his character becomes more and more anguished and bitter his voice becomes rougher and matches the Phantom's turmoil all the way to the end where he finally breaks. His voice may be rough but it fits the character better than a technically perfect voice  who would still sing perfectly while they were filled with rage? Butler's emotional range is huge and people who say his acting is flat must be missing the fine subtlety he can project with one glance of his tortured gaze one drop of his head in utter despair. His ability to scream in anger followed immediately by a whispered heart wrenching plea is a painfully beautiful moment to witness. To be able in one moment to sing beautifully clear and in the next moment allow his voice to crack with sadness or anger is imperfectly perfect. We should be filled with disgust at the Phantom's actions and yet we can't because Gerard Butler is able to show us what we know is really inside the Phantom  a man who murders and seems consumed by hatred but in truth is simply lonely and yearns to be loved.".

But there's one thing  everyone keeps saying Gerard Butler can't sing. I disagree. Not to put anyone down but I heard the Michael Crawford version of Music of the Night yesterday and I liked Butler's rendition much better. His voice is powerful and deep and dark and sexy and altogether I thought more appropriate for the character. And he sings with such INTENSITY and FEELING. True he is pushing it on some of the really high notes but he more than makes up for it the other 99 of the time. And sometimes it's better that way  for example in the All I Ask of You reprise he's all weak and shaky but he's crying so it makes it totally authentic. The Phantom is such a complex character with such emotional depth and Butler gets all of that across. He said on TV that he was limited in the acting because of the mask so he had to convey everything through his voice. He succeeds. Phenomenally.".

Beware though this movie is VERY SEXY!!! My husband and I saw it on Valentine's Day and almost skipped dinner after the movie and went straight home!!!! This is not your mother's phantom. You learn so much more in the movie. The symbolism is incredible as are the effects. Sets and costumes are stunning! One to see again and again. Minnie Driver was sooo funny going on and on about her puppy. She was a perfect pout. The roof scene All I Ask of You was filled with tension you never really see in the stage version. Being able to see such depth of expression on the actors faces added so much to the movie version. I also realized in the movie that Christine's father was a famous violinist. Notice how many of the musical themes belonging to Christine and the Phantom feature the violin. The movie also brings out the Fruedian theme of Christine's love for her deceased father and her not really knowing if her father is the Phantom or not. Go see this movie. It is worthy of all the praise it receives and more!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Phantom of the Opera is based off of both Gaston Leroux's novel and Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage musical. It tells the story of a mysterious man that lives beneath the Paris Opera House and is madly in love with a young ballet dancer. The managers of the opera house think he is a phantom. The young dancer believes he is the Angel of Music sent by her dead father to watch over her. When the phantom begins to kill and cause damage to the opera house the dancer's heroic suitor sets out to stop the phantom once and for all. With great music and stunning sets this is the best version of the tale on film.Joel Shumacher's career was pretty much destroyed after Batman and Robin came out but after a few good movies to pick himself up he was given a seemingly impossible task. To turn Andrew Lloyd Webber's world famous stage musical into a movie. Sadly I've never had the chance to see the show but I have been listening to the music almost all of my life. I was excited beyond words when this movie came out. I was worried about Shumacher a little bit but as soon as I saw the movie it didn't matter. He adapted the stage show almost perfectly to the screen. There are a few changes but they work and they make the movie so much better than if it was a straight copy. I loved the sets and the cinematography. Even if you're not a fan of musicals I highly recommend you see this if you're interested in film at all. This movie is a visual necessity. You'll learn a thing or two. The angles at which certain scenes are shot the black and white footage the sets they all make this movie so good. Of course Andrew Lloyd Webber's music is genius and I still get chills whenever I hear the overture.The acting is great. I was worried about almost every actor in this movie initially. I mean Gerard Butler was Dracula in Dracula 2000 Emmy Rossum was that chick from The Day After Tomorrow and who the heck is Patrick Wilson. Well all that went out the window after I saw the movie. Emmy Rossum was amazing in the role of Christine. I really didn't think she could sing. Gerard Butler was absolutely perfect in the role of the phantom. He played the character both sympathetically as well as devilishly creepy. His singing was nowhere near bad either.Overall this is the best movie based off a stage show out there. The amazing acting cinematography and direction combine to make this one great movie.910".

	schema:reviewBody "I have said before and I will confess again I am just a sucker for the Disney cutesy live action movies. Princess Diaries Freaky Friday Parent Trap. They are predictable but always fun and light hearted and humorous. It's a recipe for film that has worked for Disney far longer than any of us care to think about. In saying that I am not a Hillary Duff fan although she seems multi talented her characters never change and her scope as an actress will seemingly be limited to Lizzie McGuire for the rest of her career. A Cinderella Story is exactly what one would expect. It's a retelling of the old classic fairy tale with the modern day twist but director Mark Rosman who has really nothing to claim fame to does a terrific job at truly modernizing the story without coming across as stupid or blatantly obvious. Duff plays Sam a girl who's father is tragically taken from her after marrying a wicked woman played perfectly hideously by Jennifer Coolidge you can't help but despise her in this role. She is accompanied by her two daughters Brianna and Gabriella who are spoiled little brats that like to make Sam's life a living hell. Sam's wicked stepmother takes over Sam's father's pride of joy his diner and turns into her own little cash cow while keeping her late husband's staff on to torture them. She always makes Sam grind her fingers to the bone in between school classes working in the diner. Sam has an online boyfriend whom she's never met there is a school dance in which he wants to meet her he turns out to be Mr. Popular she sneaks out having to be back at the diner for twelve before her stepmother finds out. The rest of the story unfolds as you might expect. As with all live action cutesy Disney type films the cast shines...yes even Duff. She's too goody for her own good which works in this case as you feel sorry for her. Her surrogate family the diner staff are delightful and funny and they help us root for the underdog. Rhonda played by Regina King who has been some great family movies ie Mighty Joe Young and Daddy Day Care is perfect as Sam's protector and Fairy Godmother you might say?? And Chad Michael Murray is great as her Saviour and Prince Charming. The best part of this film is the way the retelling is handled. It's not done in such a way that you are blatantly watching another rehashing of an old fairy tale but rather handled delicately and done in such a modern way that you think to yourself Hey that's almost like Cinderella. You actually feel for each character the way you are supposed to feel and you want to see each and every one get what they deserve and incidentally they all do which leaves you satisfied and happy with the film.This movie won't rake in any critical acclaim but it's fun and you'll enjoy it if you like this style of movie. I suggest checking it out!! 710".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS THROUGHOUT Man do people hate this movie!!!! I guess I could See why. Oscar winner it ain't. But there are so many movies that are worse then this. I gave this a 6 which normally means OK maybe but not really that great. In this case though I guess my review will Be a Mostly positive onebecause this was actually many points better then I ever dreamed it would be.First off I watched this when I was sicknow I have done that in the past with other movies and they've put me to sleep. Cinderella Story kept my attention nicely. This movie to me didn't seem bad or dreadfuljust unoriginal. There was not a lot of creativity that went into this it's just basically the retelling of Cinderella high school style. But I moderately enjoyed it. I was aware when I was watching it that I wasn't watching anything particularly new or different just a sweet little movie. And I can say I even liked this a bit.People have complained this isn't original but I actually think that's a plus. My fear was that they'd turn the story of Cinderella into an action movie. I mean Hollywood lately especially HAS been known to do things like that. But the story's basically the same and although I'd have not originally thought of Duff for this role she's actually pretty good in it. Chad Michael Murray who played Austin was good as well although he looked about 5 or 10 years older then Duff but he was good in the role.The movie does contain a few laugh out loud funny lines and best of all you know what's gonna happen before it happens so you can relax and enjoy yet another version of a timeless classic. This movie is nowhere near at the level of a movie like Ever After and I honestly could not give it above a 6 but it's very much fun to watch at times and clearly not made with the makers expecting Oscars. I'd say if your in the right mood give it a chance. My vote's 6 of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS THROUGHOUT Man do people hate this movie!!!! I guess I could See why. Oscar winner it ain't. But there are so many movies that are worse then this. I gave this a 6 which normally means OK maybe but not really that great. In this case though I guess my review will Be a Mostly positive onebecause this was actually many points better then I ever dreamed it would be.First off I watched this when I was sicknow I have done that in the past with other movies and they've put me to sleep. Cinderella Story kept my attention nicely. This movie to me didn't seem bad or dreadfuljust unoriginal. There was not a lot of creativity that went into this it's just basically the retelling of Cinderella high school style. But I moderately enjoyed it. I was aware when I was watching it that I wasn't watching anything particularly new or different just a sweet little movie. And I can say I even liked this a bit.People have complained this isn't original but I actually think that's a plus. My fear was that they'd turn the story of Cinderella into an action movie. I mean Hollywood lately especially HAS been known to do things like that. But the story's basically the same and although I'd have not originally thought of Duff for this role she's actually pretty good in it. Chad Michael Murray who played Austin was good as well although he looked about 5 or 10 years older then Duff but he was good in the role.The movie does contain a few laugh out loud funny lines and best of all you know what's gonna happen before it happens so you can relax and enjoy yet another version of a timeless classic. This movie is nowhere near at the level of a movie like Ever After and I honestly could not give it above a 6 but it's very much fun to watch at times and clearly not made with the makers expecting Oscars. I'd say if your in the right mood give it a chance. My vote's 6 of 10.";

My granddaughters are laughing at me because I even bought the sound track and played it in the car when I picked them up at school. You don't even like that kind of music is all I hear from them through their laughter. I am determined to like the music at least half as much as I love the movie. Wish there would have been more buildup ie details of the instant message relationship and more focus on the Prince and Cinderella their feeling and emotions before and after the ball. If your parents grandparents or other old people you know were fans of the Parent Trap or Ever After please find a way to get them to watch this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Well I thought that this movie is just some teen romance flick that will not emphasize so much on feeling. Fortunately it turns out unexpectedly. The feeling in this movie is so appealing and sensible. It is not just merely the fantasy story of Cinderella that one would have expect it to be. At least I can feel the emotions and the romance. For a romance movie I don't expect it to be as great as Titanic but this movie is just fine. Besides this movie also brings forth many messages that would be useful to youth nowadays and I consider it to be very educational. The most important message in this movie I personally think is 'nothing is impossible if you just believe' and 'the fear of being rejected' as these messages are vital in the life as a teenager nowadays. Overall this movie fulfill most of the important aspects that one movie should have. It has a good plot and wellacted by the casts. The casts managed to express their character well and this is quite remarkable as most of them are young actors like Hilary Duff and Chad Michael Murray. This movie also has an appropriate soundtrack to go with it. One more thing this movie is surely hilarious and I think most of the people will like it. With all the mentioned features one will remain seated until the entire movie ends. Quite a good movie!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't looked at other reviews of A Cinderella Story yet but especially because it's a Hilary Duff film I'd expect there to be a lot of scathing comments. That's because Hilary Duff is or was at least popular with tweens and teens and lots of slightly older folks have a tendency to hate commercial or popular stuff just because it's commercial or popular. Of course they find other ways to justify their effectively institutional hatred of this stuff and I'd guess that the main complaint would be the clichd and predictable nature of the material here.And that's true. A Cinderella Story is clichd and predictable but that's not a great reason to dislike it. It is a Cinderella story after allit tells you right there in the titleretooled as a contemporary Los Angelesarea high school romancecomedy. We all know the Cinderella story fairly well. And any film fan at least old enough to almost be through with high school is surely familiar with the clichs of romcoms and high school films. Most of us could write the basics of A Cinderella Story's plot without even seeing the film's trailer. So for adults at least A Cinderella Story is going to be successful or not dependent on how well it hikes its welltrodden path.For me the best material was the more traditional Cinderellabased stuff. Jennifer Coolidge voluptuously fills the role of the wicked stepmother. I like Coolidge a lot. She has tremendous charisma and performs her infamous quirky sarcastic act here with verve. I also like Duff. The two actresses playing Duff's stepsisters were new to me but just as charismatic as Coolidge. Director Mark Rosman quotes some of the cartoonish visual gags of Disney's Cinderella 1950 more than I expected and it works amazingly well. It's one element that pushes the film into a welcomed absurdsurreal territory.What didn't work as well for me was the material when Rosman and credited writer Leigh Dunlap forgot about doing a pumped up remake of Cinderella. Too much of A Cinderella Story deals with Sam's Duff budding cyberromance her typical high school problems and the caricatured stereotypical high school cliques. It's not that these other segments are bad exactly but they just don't have the spark or humor that the Cinderella material has and especially for something like the cliques we've seen this tens of times before. These scenes would be right at home if we edited them into any of those other films or television showssometimes I had to remind myself that I wasn't watching say a Cordelia scene from the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer 1997.So A Cinderella Story has a bit of a split personalityas a funny and wacky remake of Cinderella and as a far less humorous pretty generic getting through adolescence and finding yourself message film. That AfterSchoolSpecialstyled message may be a worthy one but intercut with a great version of Cinderella it doesn't quite fit even though Rosman does finally start to find a unique and admirable groove while still alternating modes towards the end of the film.".

	schema:headline " Good but Predictable";
	schema:reviewBody "Hilary Duff stars in a modern remake of the popular fairy tale except her Cinderella is a high school senior dealing with a selfobsessed stepmother  Jennifer Coolidge and two wicked stepsisters. When she meets her prince charming online at a Halloween dance she has to leave their date in a hurry leaving him her cell phone as the only clue to her true identity.A Cinderella Story tells the oldest story in the book and it's actually not that bad. Sure it's unoriginal and lame but there are some original lines and fun characters. Hilary Duff is the star and she gives a good performance. She isn't about to win an Oscar or anything but it was a convincing performance. Chad Michael Murray plays her love interest and he gives an okay performance. There is a problem between Chad and Hilary though they don't really have chemistry together. If they had more chemistry then the film would have been better but they both play likable characters so it's not all bad. The supporting actors are the real reason why this film works so well. Jennifer Coolidge steals the movie as the botox evil stepmother and she gives a pretty funny performance. Regina King is also pretty good as Rhonda and she offers a decent amount of laughs.Once you get by the good looking mildly charming cast there isn't much else. Mark Rosman does a terrible job at directing the film keeping it simple yet very dull. There may be a few original lines here or there but the film is pretty bland. The movie is only 95 minutes long so it's not too much of a pain to watch but it does drag during a few scenes. It is also unrealistic which is kind of surprising because this is a modern update of the story so you would expect it to be a lot more believable. Despite these flaws the film was still mildly enjoyable and it was pretty harmless as well. It was also a lot better than Chasing Liberty and New York Minute. In the end fans of the genre should enjoy the movie but it's more on the forgettable side. Rating 610".

	onyx:emotionText "Hilary Duff stars in a modern remake of the popular fairy tale except her Cinderella is a high school senior dealing with a selfobsessed stepmother  Jennifer Coolidge and two wicked stepsisters. When she meets her prince charming online at a Halloween dance she has to leave their date in a hurry leaving him her cell phone as the only clue to her true identity.A Cinderella Story tells the oldest story in the book and it's actually not that bad. Sure it's unoriginal and lame but there are some original lines and fun characters. Hilary Duff is the star and she gives a good performance. She isn't about to win an Oscar or anything but it was a convincing performance. Chad Michael Murray plays her love interest and he gives an okay performance. There is a problem between Chad and Hilary though they don't really have chemistry together. If they had more chemistry then the film would have been better but they both play likable characters so it's not all bad. The supporting actors are the real reason why this film works so well. Jennifer Coolidge steals the movie as the botox evil stepmother and she gives a pretty funny performance. Regina King is also pretty good as Rhonda and she offers a decent amount of laughs.Once you get by the good looking mildly charming cast there isn't much else. Mark Rosman does a terrible job at directing the film keeping it simple yet very dull. There may be a few original lines here or there but the film is pretty bland.

The setting is really good and be transferring it to a modern setting it made the original story even better. Hilary Duff as Sam 'Cinderella' was brilliant but the only problem was that Hilary is very pretty so how could none of the guys at school except that freaky drama guy never have noticed her before? Also would like to add her dress was absolutely amazing. Chad Michael Murray was the perfect Prince Charming absolutely gorgeous. It made all the girls watching jealous of Hilary when she got her kiss. Chad and Hilary were the perfect couple as the boys would fantasise about Hilary and the girls about Chad. Overall I must say this film was brilliant and a cool teenage comedy. Any one who disagrees has me to answer to as they are clearly stupid!".

	schema:reviewBody "A Cinderella Story is yet another instance of Hollywood taking a classic fairy tale from the Middle Ages and doing it up in modern dress. This one is set in the Valley Girl world of snooty bitches and pimplyfaced teens where love blooms in internet chat rooms and romantic encounters are reduced to an endless exchange of poorly spelled and ungrammatical text messages.The story begins in the 1994 San Fernando Valley when Sam's deliriously happy childhood is shattered by the sudden death of her father in the Northridge earthquake of all things I wish I were kidding about this but I'm not leaving her to suffer under the iron fists of a wicked stepmother and two equally repulsive stepsisters. One wonders what Sam's lightsout time must have been since the quake in the film occurs while her father is reading her a bedtime story  a bit odd considering that the actual shaker took place at 435 in the morning. The film quickly moves to the present day where we encounter a teenaged Sam living a life of sheer unadulterated drudgery while still yearning for that fairy tale prince to ride into the scene and take her away from it all.To more comfortably accommodate the contemporary setting all the magical elements of the story have been effectively eliminated and only the romantic clichs remain. Thus the fairy godmother has been converted into a sassy waitress who watches over Sam and provides her with the gown she needs at that crucial Cinderella moment the ball has become a high school Halloween dance the glass slipper has morphed into a leftbehind cell phone though little is actually ever done with that and Prince Charming is no longer the heir to an entire kingdom but rather a hunky quarterback with dreams of going to Princeton ha ha against his father's expressed wishes.Hilary Duff doesn't exactly embarrass herself in the role of Cinderella but she is forced to struggle with a screenplay overflowing with annoying overthetop stereotypes and teen romance banalities. And the movie boasts a penultimate scene at the big championship football game that will have the girls in the audience sighing with satisfaction  and the boys groaning in pain.With one preposterous scene after another this lame and insipid bythenumbers concoction is an insult to thinking teens everywhere.".

Aside from all that this has to be the least oscarworthy screen jaunt that I have even encountered. Hilary Duff has managed to play Lizzie Mc Guire in every movie she has been in. Her over the top valley girlesque persona is at best flat and lifeless. Chad Michael Murray as cute as the boy is has stooped to new lows. It is obvious that he is far too old for the movie plus this is a complete departure of anything that Murray is qualified to play. The football player is a stretch for someone who is so in tune with his bad boy image. Overall I would not recommend this movie for anyone over the age of ten. Ignorance comes with youth and in this case ignorance to decent movie making iswithout a doubt bliss.".

She falls in love with a football jock Austin Ames Chad Michael Murray by instant messaging and he doesn't know it's her. They meet at the school dance and she has to leave by the stroke of midnight so her stepmother won't find out that she wasn't working at the diner...then she drops her cell phone on her way which is a replacement for a glass slipper...cute and Austin tries to find her and blah blah blah you know the story.That's just how the whole story went. SO unbelievably disgustingly predictable. Of course the beautiful blonde Miss Hilary Duff HAS to go out with the handsome blonde Chad Michael Murray. It's meant to be. And then there are the popular crew...the guys are all big dumb jerks and the girls are all beautiful snobby bitches. And then Austin Ames who's supposed to be the MOST popular guy in the whole school is this totally nice down to earth guy. Of course it's always the popular people who are so mean and evil. Every cheap tween movie has that. And it's weird really any bozo can see that Sam is just as beautiful as those girls in the popular crowd. And with a likable personality. Maybe they could've made it a great movie by casting an ugly weird girl as the part of Sam. That would've made it at least realistic. The stepmother and stepsisters are overly done. No one like those people exist. Especially the evil stepsisters. Seriously fans I ask you are there people who really act like that? Come on they're just there to make Hilary Duff look good.The reason why I gave this movie a 2 pretty generous of me huh? is because I guess for Hilary Duff's fans and some little girls under 10 it is an enjoyable movie. Normal cute predictable plot with a normal cute predictable ending I guess. If you're looking for that kind of movie then Hilary Duff would be a good Sam. She's normal cute and predictable. Maybe not with the best acting but not embarrassing either. She recorded some songs on the Soundtrack and anyone can see she's no singer if I hear that helium whiny voice again I'm seriously gonna snap but she's likable because in every movie she plays the good part. The innocent part. But if you ask me it was a cheap boring tween movie that made me laugh SO much though not intentionally with all the wornout stereotypes.".

This movie has a great message. not that it needed one And it's a great family film. Not that I would want to watch it with my family. I prefer to watch a lot of movies by myself so I cannot be influenced. If you have not yet seen A Cinderella Story go out and buy it right now!";

But when I was more grown up I watched this film again I figured since I loved the 3 previous Batman films why not give this one another shot? Now seeing this movie once again I can understand the low rating on IMDb this movie was just a pathetic attempt at merchandising Batman and making an over the top action movie that really had nothing to do with Batman. The casting was just oh so plain wrong. We have Arnold Schwartzenegger as Dr. Freeze?! Not to mention the accent the character was just someone you felt like you could laugh off. Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl she was alright but again questionable casting since she seemed out of place. Now George Clooney?! I couldn't believe how Val Kilmer got complained about but George Clooney I can see why. He was just the most awkward Batman ever and didn't fit the role at all he was only used for his popularity.Batman is living it up with his bachelor lifestyle but Robin is a bit upset that he is living under Batman's shadow and wishes to be the star. Alfred is becoming very sick and needs serious help his niece Barbara comes to his aid and hopes to help him and stays with Bruce Wayne. Dr. Freeze is our new villain and is looking for a cure for his wife who is frozen until he can find a cure for her he also is intending for the world to pay for what has happened to him and his wife for some reason. Dr. Pamela Isley is a plant scientistright activist and while her boss sees her finding out more than she needs to know about an experiment on his version of Frankenstien named Bang he kills her with her plants. But the plants chemicals have an effect on her and actually make her into Poisen Ivy. She and Freeze team up to take over Gothem and of course to split Batman and Robin forever oh yeah then kill them I guess.Batman  Robin was really beyond over the top the costumes were a bit silly and the story was just too family friendly. This is Batman the Dark Knight it's not meant to be this bright and so crazy. I couldn't believe Joel did this I really wish I could get past this I know he's going to get a bad rap for this film for the rest of his career. The acting was just stupid and not true to Batman at all. The problem here was that the story and setting just had nothing to do with what Batman truly is and was just an excuse to spend stupid money. Please don't watch this film if you love Batman or you'll be sorry.210".

But the show still betrayed all the emotion and grimness of Batman's themes.In Batman  Robin Schumacher seems to be getting back to those roots. He treats the entire Batman franchise like a joke. Even if it was funny this would be betraying the name of Batman. But here seeing as it's NOT funny it only succeeds in becoming the worst of the Batman movies and arguably the worst films ever created. And I'm taking into account Plan 9 From Outer Space Gigli and You Got Served.George Clooney just plays George Clooney. Which is the road he usually takes but this suave dashing and charming Batman seems more like Mystery Men's Captain Amazing than the crimefighter of legend.There's Chris O'Donnell the angstridden Robin trying to break out of Batman's shadow. The only thing he ever really does is act like a child.Alicia Silverstone. Wow. I seriously wonder what makes someone say Hmm who should we get to play Batgirl . . . I know! Alicia Silverstone! No offense to Alicia but she's out in right field on this one. Her toughgirl performance is sprinkled with reminders of her Clueless days. But all that aside she actually does very little.Now onto the villains. Uma Thurman who we know CAN act is hamming it up to ridiculous proportions. First when she's playing the nerdy Dr. Pamela she exaggerates that to a level I thought impossible. And then she inexplicably turns into an extremely sexualized villainess whose plan by the way would kill all the plants she advocated protecting.Arnold seems like the worst possible choice for Mr. Freeze. I mean of all the Batman villains I could see him playing  Bane for christ's sake  Mr. Freeze is not on that list. He possesses none of the emotionless calculated and cold no pun intended sociopathy which makes Mr. Freeze such a good character.And then all that aside they're handed ridiculous catch phrases and cliches they're expected to say with any level of sincerity? At one point Mr. Freeze says chill out. Of all the ways it sounds menacing is not among them.Seriously I'd have more respect for Schumacher if I discovered that he hated Batman and had intentionally ruined it with this garbage. Then this might actually be just his own personal joke. Instead it borders on a travesty of good cinema. I only wish that 0 stars was a selectable option at the imdb for this film ALONE.".

Batman is popular simply because of the comic book not because of that retarded TV show starring Adam West but this movie is more fashioned after that campy trash. This was nothing but a slap in the face to every true fan of the Batman. The direction of Joel Schumacher was deplorable. The set designs looked cheap the ice looked and acted like dried craft glue and were visually painful especially the overuse of the red neon hue in many scenes. The digital effects were OK but often over done. The production cost was extensive and I wonder what percentage of the budget went to the salaries of Arnold George Uma and Alicia. I'm sure it was high. I know Arnold got 20 million so the percentage had to be fairly high. Well everyone one of them needed to give back large portions of their salaries because their performances were atrocious. Alicia Silverstone needs to give her entire salary back. Hers was probably one the worst performances ever in a major motion picture. Arnold can't act anyway so I wasn't really expecting much but I was disappointed when I heard he was cast as Freeze because he in no way fits that character. Freeze was a scientist and when I look at Arnold my first thought is not Scientist. Ben Kingsly or Patrick Stewart would have fit better. Uma who is normally a credible actress was too drama queen which made it hard to immerse yourself in scenes she was in. Clooney was totally miscast as Bruce WayneBatman. I mean it's hard not to laugh when Batman is shorter than Robin. George like Uma was too overly dramatic especially in scenes with Alfred which made it hard to take him seriously. Chris O'Donnell was really the only actor that seemed real. With all that I would have to say the overwhelmingly worst part of this movie was the script. Akiva Goldsman should have been banned from Hollywood after this script. It was a completely brainless jumbled mess. The story which was pitiful at best gets completely lost in entirely too many characters. It was so frustrating seeing the origins of certain characters ripped too shreds as Goldsman attempted to jam them into the script. Batgirl who should have never been in this film in the first place was changed from Commissioner Gordon's daughter to Alfred's niece which made absolutely no sense. In an attempt to explain why Freeze was so muscular it was explained he was an Olympic gymnast. How freakin' stupid is that? Gymnasts by necessity need to be small in stature to perform well in gymnastics and Arnold is enormous. Goldsman's use of dialogue was highly irritating consisting of nothing but one juvenile oneliner after another after another after another. One other thing that really irritated me was the complete mishandling and waste of the character Bane. Bane is a much more complex and vicious villain in the comics and this movie version with Bane reduces him to a mindless henchman. Bane deserves much more character development than he received in BR. The same thing happened in Forever when one of the most highly complex and interesting villains in the comics TwoFace got reduced to second billing. Note to Warner Bros. stop screwing with Batman he can sell himself and stop trying to cram so many characters into the films and understand nobody wants to see a Campy Caped Crusader.".

What was I thinking watching Batman  Robin for a third time? Even worse what was I doing actually starting to enjoy it?Yes there's something endearingly awful about a film that fails on almost every technical level. But it wasn't always so. The first two films in the franchise anchored by the strong and much undervalued lead of Michael Keaton were enjoyable popart excursions by Tim Burton. The first still by far the best allowed Jack Nicholson to ham it up amongst retro stylings and the music of Prince. The second Batman Returns was a less successful effort to homage German expressionist cinema the darkest of the four films and struggled slightly under the weight of three villains.The lesson wasn't learnt and the usage of multiple baddies has been a fixed staple ever since. With the third Batman Forever the flat acting of new bat Val Kilmer was coupled with Joel Schumacher's garish direction and Chris O'Donnell's irritating Robin. Akiva Goldsman was now the writer and any sense of depth had given way to trite puns and disjointed set pieces.And so it was that everything that was symptomatically flawed with the series was expanded upon and magnified for the fourth and by far the weakest instalment. George Clooney has accepted a lot of the blame for this film a humble admission but unfair. While he's clearly miscast as both Batman and Bruce Wayne he doesn't give a bad performance per se. Rather it's his back up that lets the side down. Uma Thurman am I the only one who doesn't think she's that goodlooking? has a great time overdoing it as Poison Ivy but she's joined by Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze. Schwarz not exactly known for his acting skill is unrecognisable under his costume so what's the point? He gets to call Batman Batunbuuurg refers to Robin as Buuurd Bouy and only has 100 lines in total. The fact that 26 of these lines are lame puns on the word ice that even a twoyearold would struggle to find funny is even more deplorable. And when you hear Freeze tell Batman Yew arr not zending mee too da cooola the urge to use the video's stop button is almost insurmountable.Bane makes up the trio a monosyllabic muscleman in a gimp mask. A completely unnecessary addition he offers nothing to the plot and goes largely forgotten. The introduction of wonkymouthed Alicia Silverstone as a fatuous Batgirl character is also grating. And why doesn't her costume come fitted with Batnipples like the rest?Tiny traces of amusement can be gleaned from Ivy's dialogue with her urges that her garden needs tending adding some form of adult tone to the humour. However it's unrelenting innuendo  I'll help you grab your rocks  does start to wear thin very quickly. I did smile at Batman's cashcard I never leave the cave without it and it's also nice to see some small references from other films. Even if it is just a glimpse of the Riddler's costume from Forever some guards paraphrasing Cobra or some street bystanders dressed as Clockwork Orange Droogs. In fact the idea of a Batman film as completely OTT comedy sendup may have worked were the rest of the humour more sophisticated. It's the hockey team from Hell So this is where you hang out I'll cancel the pizza oh how lame and functional the dialogue is!The film wraps up with a rather pathetic plot contrivance and George having to dish out bland platitudes. Not all heroes wear masks to give life... that's true power. Oh it really is abominably bad. Batman  Robin exists as a classic example of the Hollywood system folding in under its own weight. However the universal slating this one got neglects one factor while the least successful it still made over 230000000 at the box office. I wonder how many people would be satisfied with failures like that?".

It is hard to believe that money was spent to make this. It could have been used on something else charity I suppose. I was 12 when I went to see this and it broke my heart. Batman was my favorite comic book and character when I was a kid and this film broke my spirit. The excellence of the Tim BurtonMichael Keaton films are long gone. The dark emotional center and development of the hero and the villains is sidelined for action sequences action sequences and some more action sequences some of them incorporating the worst CGI and model work ever seen on film. The casting itself had to the potential to make a good film. George Clooney could have made a great Batman square jawed popular with the ladies the only thing going against him being that can be too laid back maybe with a better script he could do the darker material. Uma Thurman is perfect for Poison Ivy. She is a good looking yet quirky actress but you wouldn't know it by the emphasis on camp context and innuendo in this film. Arnie is maybe a little miscast as Mr Freeze but he does well getting a chance to use some 'great' puns but someone who can come across as more evil would  have been better. Then there is Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone as Robin and Batgirl. Let's just say more charisma can come from a line of fridge freezers with nothing in them. The only decent performance comes from Michael Gough as Alfred only one of two actors to have appeared in all four films. His performance is wonderful in this otherwise mess of a film.The blame for this disaster can be laid at the hands of Joel Schumacher. His direction misplaced and his intentions misguided. He may have redeemed himself with Phone Booth but he will always be the man who destroyed Batman in my eyes.".

Despite Schwarzenegger's intellect he is one of the governors in USA with the highest IQ he comes off as an ignorant person because of his accent.2. Allow George Clooney to play Batman as gay. I am actually a fan of Clooney but his performance in this movie is disgraceful to say the least. He has stated himself that he found it amusing to play Bruce Wayne as gay. I a great fan of the comics did not find this amusing at all.3. Move away from the serious tone of the first movies which made them successful and do a poor imitation of the 60's camp show with Adam West.4. Cast Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. I usually think Uma Thurman is hot but her overacting in this movie is so distasteful she loses all kind of sexual appeal which in turn destroys any kind of menace the character should have had. Poor poor poor.5. Allowing Joel Schumacher free reins over the movie after seeing which direction he was taking the franchise with the previous movie. This is just the sign of a bad producer.6. Remove all tension in the fight sequences by dumbing them down to the point where it is beyond stupidity. Batman and Robin playing hockey with a diamond is not my idea of a cool fight scene. Several fight scenes actually had me gasping with shock as to how poor they are.7. Cast Alicia Silverstone as a bad girl Batgirl. She cannot pull it off.8. The nipples people. THE NIPPLES!!! How ridiculous is this?! Batman and Robin's suits have nipples but when Batgirl makes her entrance notice the lack of the same.9. Write a script that makes no sense whatsoever.10. Turn one of the most memorable villains of the comics into a brainless henchman. I am referring of course to Bane who in the comics is one of Batman's worst enemies because of his strength and intellect. Bane has actually beaten Batman on several occasions and although The Joker is undoubtedly Batman's nemesis Bane isn't far off. I squirm with the way they treated him in this movie.In my honest opinion this could in fact be the worst movie... no scratch that... worst thing man has ever created. So with that I give my final score.110".

George Clooney played a different kind of Bruce WayneBatman..a more lighthearted smiling guy. Honestly I found he was good...then again George Clooney could just stand there and he'd make me swoon. Chris O'Donnell was also great in his reprise as Robin and I enjoyed him a lot. I loved the brotherly dynamic between the two characters that was shown in this film.Alicia Sylverstone was also good as batgirl although if she wasn't there it wouldn't have made a difference. But she was so basing my review off of that she did her role well.The two villains were very entertaining. I loved Uma Thurman's poison ivy and I found her to be highly entertaining. Her powder became annoying after a little bit though. Also Arnold's Freeze was very good. Yes he had some corny lines and yes he was a little creepy looking but overall he was very convincing as a villain and actually provided a challenge for the protagonists unlike the other bad guys we've seen. His backstory about trying to find the cure for his ailing wife was very emotional as well.Overall as I've said for the past movies do NOT listen to the critiques and base your interest off of that. Rather check it out for yourself and give your OWN opinion on it. You might be surprised and find yourself enjoying it!".

He is the worst Batman in my opinion.I think Kilmer was the best Clooney isn't that bad but I didn't think he fit. And the Batman Credit Card? I wanted to puke in my popcorn when I saw that!Robin Robin reminds me a lot of Luke Skywalker minus the coolness. Chris O'Donnell plays the part well. Unfortunately the part is a whiny annoying untrustworthy gullible stupid sidekick. Don't bother defending Robin he isn't worth it. He was OK in Batman Forever but his character isn't improving.Batgirl You know we really didn't need another sidekick right away did we? Why Batgirl now? Save her for number 6 for crying out loud! Alicia Silverstone is great though not in this movie but that doesn't hide the fact that the character shouldn't be there. And the constant battle of the sexes between her and Robin are annoying.Mr. Freeze Ugh. The only thing that saved this character was the fact that it was Arnold and that didn't save it. I won't forgive Joel for putting a great guy like Arnold into a crappy role like this. Yeah his thing was ice but that doesn't mean EVERY LINE OVER 5 SENTENCE no exaggeration had to be an ice pun!Poison Ivy The thing that really saved this movie. Uma Thurman did a great acting job for this part despite some other opinions. She was very sexy and interesting unlike Mr. Freeze. In some parts you were waiting to get back to her scenes. This was the only interesting villain in the movie.Bane I am stunned at Joel's ability to take a cool villain from the comics like Bane and turn him into a drooling stupid gruntlike idiot. I am too disgusted to talk about it.Alfred Alfred is just as good as always in this movie although it is getting annoying how he wants everyone he knows to be one of Batmans sidekicks.Commishoner Gordan You know in Batman you had respect for this guy.

	schema:reviewBody "Many people would beat down those who would give Batman and Robin a 7 out of 10 stars. However the latter proves to be worthy of an average score in this viewer's opinion. In this day and age it is difficult to find critics who have room in their hearts for goofy movie fun that is if the film has some form of redeeming factor. There is no denying that Batman and Robin is technically one of the worst movies ever made. From it's iceplant puns innuendos bat suit nipples and buttocks constant grappling hook saves and George Clooney playing George Clooney dressed as Batman it is something that feels like an attempted advertisement to sell action figures. The bright and colorful aspect of the film gives it that appearance. Though if people look at it through a more positive perspective they'll find the film accomplished setting out what it wanted to be from the start. Now that is not to be confused as giving Joel Schumacher credit for putting together this film turning it from Batman to Power Rangers. The cast really can't be blamed entirely for the film's failing results. They were directed to acting the way they did after all and some of the performances were acceptable while others one cannot say the same thing. Michael Keaton played the character of Bruce WayneBatman for the original 1989 film and Batman Returns decently until he was replaced by Val Kilmer for 1995's Batman Forever. Kilmer wasn't the most amazing Batman by any means but he made an effort to as best he could since that film was about as campy as this one. As already mentioned George Clooney was playing George Clooney through the whole film. Never once could an audience viewer who is a Batman fan could look at him and say This is the Batman of my imagination! Clooney goes around without showing even the slightest bit of emotion the kind that the character of Bruce Wayne is supposed to be feeling constantly especially when he is Batman. He spends most of the time looking after Robin making sure he doesn't get into trouble and while that's good even then he does not demonstrate fear for his friendbrother. To add on to that Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze is the king of camp and ice jokes in the film. Mr. Freeze was never the Joker. He's not very complicated as a character to figure out. He was always a dark vengeful and hateful man who wants nothing more than to revive his wife from her terminal disease at any cost. Not only does Arnold succeed at being himself as usual but it's as if he intended to play a JokerTwoFace knock off of Jack Nicholson and Tommy Lee Jones' performances. Additionally Batgirl's presence in the film wasn't great either. Her character felt out of place from the start being introduced as the niece of Alfred Wayne's butler. Her transformation into Batgilrl didn't feel legitimate as it did random and unconvincing. On the other hand Chris O'Donnell's performance was possibly the only performance in the film that felt legit. All throughout Robin's motivations for doing the things that he does rebelling against Batman are believable. He clearly outshines Clooney's Batman whenever the duo are on screen together. In addition to Chris O'Donnell Uma Thurman as campy as she was did surprisingly well with her role. She was a perfect choice to portray the villain Poison Ivy in this viewer's opinion even looking great for the part. It is unfortunate that her performance was hindered as a result of being casted for the wrong film. Had she starred in a Batman film directed by Christopher Nolan she could have excelled. The actor who played Alfred may he rest in peace provided the film some heart to heart moments with George Clooney's Bruce Wayne which were some of the film's best. In conclusion that is the cast. If we all can just take the film for what it is as basically a cartoon in liveaction we can find it isn't as bad as the critics say it is. Check out the following youtube address for more insight on what makes the film great httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vlXHskZCqhiI. It is clear that the film was not meant to be Christopher Nolan's the Dark Knight trilogy. Had Tim Burton who directed the first two Batman films with Michael Keaton directed this film it may have turned out differently. For what it is it is entertaining. It's one of those cases where it is so bad it's good or so good it's bad. The point being that the film doesn't fail at being the action comedy it is. While it may be a matter of persona opinion the film contains great humor. Mr. Freeze provides humor related to ice. The character of Bane while butchered as a villain character gives a few laughs as Poison Ivy's oafish muscle incapable of speech. The action in the film serves as continuation for the film's camp factor at the same time quite well done. Beneath the film's campiness is a good message about family and trusting one another something not many would appreciate but deserves to be recognized. Finally just because the critics say it's atrocious doesn't make it true. For Batman and Robin this viewer does not agree that it is the worst thing to ever happen in film. Maybe for Batman but people tend to take movies way out of hand forgetting it's all fiction and not reality. Batman Forever felt like more of a fail than this film for the way it handled it's two villains who turned out obnoxious. The villains felt amusing for this film but people can always agree to disagree on anything. Credit where credit's due for the film creating inspiration to take the superhero movie genre to a whole better level that has continued to progress today.".

	onyx:emotionText "Many people would beat down those who would give Batman and Robin a 7 out of 10 stars. However the latter proves to be worthy of an average score in this viewer's opinion. In this day and age it is difficult to find critics who have room in their hearts for goofy movie fun that is if the film has some form of redeeming factor. There is no denying that Batman and Robin is technically one of the worst movies ever made. From it's iceplant puns innuendos bat suit nipples and buttocks constant grappling hook saves and George Clooney playing George Clooney dressed as Batman it is something that feels like an attempted advertisement to sell action figures. The bright and colorful aspect of the film gives it that appearance. Though if people look at it through a more positive perspective they'll find the film accomplished setting out what it wanted to be from the start. Now that is not to be confused as giving Joel Schumacher credit for putting together this film turning it from Batman to Power Rangers. The cast really can't be blamed entirely for the film's failing results. They were directed to acting the way they did after all and some of the performances were acceptable while others one cannot say the same thing. Michael Keaton played the character of Bruce WayneBatman for the original 1989 film and Batman Returns decently until he was replaced by Val Kilmer for 1995's Batman Forever. Kilmer wasn't the most amazing Batman by any means but he made an effort to as best he could since that film was about as campy as this one. As already mentioned George Clooney was playing George Clooney through the whole film. Never once could an audience viewer who is a Batman fan could look at him and say This is the Batman of my imagination! Clooney goes around without showing even the slightest bit of emotion the kind that the character of Bruce Wayne is supposed to be feeling constantly especially when he is Batman. He spends most of the time looking after Robin making sure he doesn't get into trouble and while that's good even then he does not demonstrate fear for his friendbrother. To add on to that Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze is the king of camp and ice jokes in the film. Mr. Freeze was never the Joker. He's not very complicated as a character to figure out. He was always a dark vengeful and hateful man who wants nothing more than to revive his wife from her terminal disease at any cost. Not only does Arnold succeed at being himself as usual but it's as if he intended to play a JokerTwoFace knock off of Jack Nicholson and Tommy Lee Jones' performances.

Most of the bad things you've heard about this movie are true but that doesn't stop the film from being entertaining.Seeing Batman and Arnold Schwarzenegger duke it out is reason enough to see Batman  Robin. But while Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze carries impressive weapons and strikes a menacing figure his lines are cheesy instead of threatening. In fact cheesier lines haven't been heard since Adam West played Batman.George Clooney makes a likable super hero. Unfortunately he's not really Batman. Batman is tormented by inner demons. George Clooney never stops smiling. Even though Adam West's lines as Batman were unbelievable he still said them with a straight face as if they were serious. George Clooney says even serious lines with a cheesy grin. He's believable as rich playboy Bruce Wayne but even though his attempt to get Batman to lighten up was a noble idea the character should be played with some darkness.Still there's a great warmness between Clooney and Michael Gough who plays Alfred the butler and between Clooney and Chris O'Donnel who plays Robin the Boy Wonder. Bruce Wayne's personal life is in turmoil. Alfred his friend and mentor is dying and Bruce must cope with the idea that he might lose him. Robin is tired of standing in Batman's shadow and begins to jeopardize the Dynamic Duo's partnership. Both subplots are well acted and touching.The plot is completely preposterous but that's to be expected from a movie based on comic books. It's still entertaining. The gadgets are impressive the action scenes are well done and the Batmobile as always is cool. The lead actresses Elle MacPherson Alicia Silverstone and Uma Thurman are talented and very easy on the eyes. Uma Thurman as the evil Poison Ivy possesses a magic powder that will make men do anything for her. This seems redundant to me since her sexy costumes alone are enough to make men do anything for her.If I had to choose a worst out of the Batman movies I'd pick this one. Still it's light entertainment and worth a look.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I see reviews for the movie 'Batman and Robin' people always seem to say that it is an awful movie and one of the worst films ever made. I have seen it and to be honest I really like it. It is campy and a little stupid but it really doesn't deserve to be given the same title given to other horrible movies like 'The Garbage Pail Kids Movie' or 'Jaws The Revenge'.I'm not saying that people should stop hating on this movie because I can see what people have against it but I do think that people need to calm down about it. There are far worse superhero movies out there like 'Superman IV' and 'Catwoman'.Onto the film itself like I said I can see what people have against it The acting is awful the story is campy and the movie overall isn't well directed.I don't think the acting is that bad. There are a few characters who are terrible like Batgirl who was meant to be British but it is obvious that the actress is American but some characters do pretty good performances. George Clooney does a good job as Batman Michael Gough does a great job as Alfred Uma Thurman is a convincing Poison Ivy and Arnold Schwarzenegger is a pretty funny Mr Freeze although I do agree that most of his ice puns are painful. The rest of the characters are pretty mediocre but not terrible.The story is no Oscarwinning masterpiece but it is still a good story that flows well. The very basic plot synopsis is that Batman and Robin are trying to stop Mr Freeze and Poison Ivy from freezing Gotham City and taking over the world. Of course!That may sound like a boring and clichd story but it is actually quite good. The subplots fit into the story perfectly especially one about Alfred dying of MacGregor's Syndrome.Overall I feel that Batman and Robin is one of the most overhated movies of all time and should really be given a chance. Like I said it isn't perfect but it really isn't as awful as everybody says. If you watch the movie with the knowledge that is a campy flick you'll have a good time just don't listen to the people who say that it is a horrible abomination to cinema because it really isn't.710P.S.  If you want to know what I think of Bane I think he is closer to the comics than Bane in 'The Dark Knight Rises' because the inclusion of the Venom drug that gives Bane his strength.".

What I REALLY liked was that Bruce and Dick learned immediately of Barbara's role as Batgirl. That was a welcome relief to the Batman series 50 years ago when the whole bit of the Dynamic Duo not knowing of Batgirl's secret identity got stale rapidly and instead became annoying.And I give credit to the screenwriters and George Clooney for not playing Batman as some sort of clown.

I also found myself shaking my head at the whole rocket incident just couldn't get my mind around it. I'm not saying the other Batman movies were realistic who ever heard of a Cathedral as big as the one in Batman or a kid that grew up in the sewers but they were still easy to relate back to our world. Gotham City in Batman and Robin seems to be on another planet. But despite some annoying characteristics the film does satisfy and is a good entertainer giving plenty of action and some impressive fight scenes. George Clooney is a good Batman much more like Michael Keaton's original brilliant performance than Val Kilmer's was. Arnold played Mr Freeze very well and Uma Thurma was a scene stealer as Poison Ivy. Elle MacPherson's character was hardly necessary and her performance reflected this I actually missed what happened to her in the end. Overall not the best Batman movie but still worth the watch.".

But despite some annoying characteristics the film does satisfy and is a good entertainer giving plenty of action and some impressive fight scenes. George Clooney is a good Batman much more like Michael Keaton's original brilliant performance than Val Kilmer's was. Arnold played Mr Freeze very well and Uma Thurma was a scene stealer as Poison Ivy. Elle MacPherson's character was hardly necessary and her performance reflected this I actually missed what happened to her in the end. Overall not the best Batman movie but still worth the watch.";

George Clooney acts to happy to be batman for someone who is supposed to be tormented superhero. Chris O'Donnell acts the most realistic out of all of them. now the plots are even worse. believe it or not Batman the dark hero is attending fundraisers. there is no telling ever in the movie why poison Ivy goes to Gotham and why she wants to befriend Freeze. Gotham has no realism any more towering statues are everywhere. they look bigger than the statue of liberty and there everywhere. Mr. freeze's rocket makes the least sense. in the beginning of the movie he takes off in a rocket just to jump out. the only thing that actually makes sense is that Alfred gets sick. everything else is just a bunch of cheesy plots and lines while the actors do nothing to support their roles.".

Throw in a husband of Charo getting out of jail and edgy cops trying to bust Portugues and you have an amazing movie that should've gotten much more attention here in the states. The performances in this film are much better than most you see by actors who receive far more attention. Especially Ruth Gabriel who gives one of the most memorable performances by a young actress 18 or 19 I've seen. Carmelo Gomez is a leading man who should be a household name here and would be if we respected international films the same way they do ours. They both give Oscar worthy performances in a film that will definitely leave an impression on you. Recommended for those who liked Dirty Pretty Things or 21 grams.".

A raw punchy love story set set against the background of terrorism . This is an intense thriller unflinchingly directed by Imanol Uribe . A womanizer and sexaddict man named Antonio Carmelo Gomez belongs to commando Madrid also formed by Elvira Minguez and Joseba Apaolaza from the terrorist organization Eta which is preparing a massacre in the capital. Antonio is posing as a photographer but he sets other priorities when he meets a druggie young named Charo Ruth Gabriel who is addicted to dope and for whom he falls in love . Later on  Antonio meets up the friends's Charo as the prostitute Vanesa Candela Pea  the local junkie Lisardo Javier Bardem and Ugarte Pepon Nieto . Meanwhile  the terrorist group carries out various attacks until the final outrage . Moving thriller plenty of emotion  suspense  intrigue  delusions  plot twists  nudism and a strange love story . Despite being somewhat of a cinematic clich rarely has a feature been so aptly deserving of its description as a thriller picture along with some elements from Noir film  action  politics and bloody terrorism . Good acting by Carmelo Gomez as a killer member of the ETA terrorist organization who feels a strong attraction for a junkie well played by Ruth Gabriel . It is an entertaining picture in which suspense is well developed from start to finish  though crammed with abundant erotic scenes in softcore style between Carmelo Gomez and Ruth Gabriel who holds several nude scenes . Imanol Uribe  also writes the script along with Juan Madrid  based on his novel  filmed in his usual formal and stylistic scholarship  without leaving a trace the thoughtprovoking issues  in terms of dramatic and narrative excitement . Hardedge thrillerdrama centers around terrorist conflicts and a peculiar love story . However  the film relies heavily in the rare romance among protagonists and on a motley group of displeasent characters  as there appear terrorists  whores  junkies  panderers  peddlers  drug dealers and nasty policemen . Because the story needs a vibration more real than the one offered in this sometimes slowmoving flick  though also contains interesting scenes  thrilling images and sensitive moments . Anyway its is compensated with the great performances from main cast  and nice support cast  interpreters who provided a considerable boost to the result . Imanol is a great director of actors and the main players are complemented by a good cast of secondaries  all of them forming a powerful human group and giving excellent interpretations such as Karra Elejalde  Candela Pea  Elvira Minguez  Pepon Nieto and special appearance by Javier Bardem . Atmospheric musical score by Jose Nieto who composes a stirring soundtrack by means of synthesizer . Including a spotless pictorial cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe and a willingness  almost perfect of the elements of each shot  every sequence  every space  being rightly filmed in Madrid . Aguirresarobe subsequently would make a prestigious career in Hollywood such as Fright night  The twilight saga eclipse The road  The others and many others . The movie achieved 27 wins and 16 nominations  being nominated and winning several Goya Awards 1995 such as Best Film  Best Director Imanol Uribe  Best Actor Carmelo Gmez  Best Supporting Actor Javier Bardem  Best New Actress Ruth Gabriel Best Adapted Screenplay Imanol Uribe  Best Editing Teresa Font Best MakeUp and Hairstyles  Best Special Effects Reyes Abades  among others . This Andres Santana production was professionally written  produced by Imanol Uribe who also directed  though has some flaws and resulted to get big success at Spanish Box office . Uribe who lived and had a son with actress Mara Barranco  gained fame early in his career for his controversial sociopolitical portraits of the Basque people  such as Fuga Segovia Muerte Mikel and he turned to thriller as Adios Pequea  Plenilunio  Carta Esferica  Dias Contados or Running out of timeand drama as Bwana  Rey Pasmado and Extraos .".

Apart from the fact that the plot of the movie is well sketched and the characters quite credible although Carmelo Gmez's character is probably not as well presented as the rest this movie is worthawatch just for Bardem himself.

Add in a splash of comedy and soupcon of starcrossed lovers if for a moment you thought pairing Tybalt and Lady McBeth qualified as starcrossed and you have what passes as characterisation. Mix dark nights with gaudy flamenco colours and you have some striking cinematography. I'll come to the plot in a minuteAmoldovar was clearly enjoying Spanish cinema's newfound postFranco sexual and artistic liberalism. The prudish among his audience might suggest he was positively wallowing in it. Whatever the truth Matador is a masterpiece of his style if not indeed a whole style in of itself.The plot  or possibly a better description the tapestry over which the characters move  is a murder hunt. Very few prizes will be won however for guessing the culprits. Two people are quickly in the audience's frame because they are shown er murdering people on camera. A third person Banderas in to my mind his best Amoldovar role confesses to the murders in a fit of insecurity and remorse over an attempted rape some girls get all the luck comments a female duty officer dryly proving that feminism wasn't that big in Spain back in the 1980s. Nevertheless the net soon closes on the crushingly obvious culprits who in the meantime have developed quite a crush on each other. As previously mentioned completely nuts.Matador's strengths are in its characterisation and its sheer barefacedness. Amoldovar has as usual assembled a character list of freaks and proceeded to humanise all of them  to the point where there is a genuine whiff of tragedy in the final act. To mention the great performances is really to rehearse the cast list. Assumpta Serna Nacho Martinez Antonio Banderas and Eva Cobo are all excellent. And it really is worth seeing just for the young Antonio.There are some interesting points made in the film about outsiders liberalism sexual politics and gender politics as always with Amoldovar. I'll let you pick through them. It is though not so much a film as a giant red rag to the raging bull of conservatism deftly whisked aside to the ragged applause of an admiring if somewhat perplexed audience. A positive Jimi Hendrix of a film unpolished with some definite dud notes but undeniably the work of a genius. 8 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Matador 1986 This late 80s film is the one which gave Almovodar wide exposure in the USA. The young Antonio Banderas plays a rather a deviant person with violent antisocial behavior issues rather than his usual stud role. As the title implies this is a blood red exposedramamurder mystery concerning bullfighters  sex in the bedroom. A young exbullfighter who is getting turned on by killing  a lady lawyer with same problem then the 3rd character a young man driven insane by overreligious upbringing. These are the main characters in this stylish black comedy about dark sides of human nature. Almvodar is a really romantic  like emotional movies with complex plots. He knows movies are never more sensual or alive than when they venture into the forbidden territory  defy limits of plot set by most other films  screenwriters. The opening is shocking A man sits in front of his TV masturbating to a montage of repulsive slashermovie images playing on his VCR. Matador makes a zingy connection between the repressed passion of Catholicism with its images of ecstatic suffering  the obsessions of its lovers. Angel's mother a member of the fanatical rightwing religious group Opus Dei. Matador isn't as complex as Law of Desire  the characters aren't so much real figures as embodiments of psychological drives  impulses almost to the point of absurdity. They represent places in the Almodovar's dream world. Still the director  his screenwriting partner Jesus Ferrero paint them with great conviction The male leads of Matador 1986  Law of Desire 1987 essentially switch places. Nacho Martinez who plays the title character of Matador takes the supporting role of Dr. Martin in Law of Desire.  Eusebio Poncela who has the supporting role of police inspector in Matador has the lead role of the film director in Law of Desire. Matador becomes in every way Surrealist Sex Comedy. The film gives huge amounts of spirited affronts to convention. 5 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "Essentially seen by many as a warped sex fantasy that uses the codes and conventions of the detective thriller to disguise a darker more psychological film about the wayward perversions and sinister desires of a seemingly affluent area of contemporary Madrid Matador 1986 can also be seen as a notsosubtle comment on the nature of modernday relationships aspirations and obsessions in a metatextual form that makes continual use of its titular bullfighting motif. Although it does have some slight thematic problems particularly in terms of the overall tone of the film and eventual motivation of the characters it is nonetheless one of Almodvar's most interesting and perplexing films of this particular period featuring a refinement of many of his earliest interests and characteristics from films like Dark Habits 1983 and What Have I Done to Deserve This? 1984 as well as being the film that signalled the move into the second phase of his career.As the implications of the title would suggest the film's narrative is bolstered by numerous references both spoken and visual to the obvious roleplay and iconography of the bullfight. It is also a film about violence and the sexuality of violence an uncomfortable idea that is reinforced by the film's provocative opening sequence in which we find the central matador of the title Diego Montes masturbating to violent scenes of exploitation cinema. The scene establishes the nature of the matador both as a character and as a social phenomenon as well as introducing the link between sex and death that will come to form an important thematic strand to the narrative. As the story progresses the mechanisms of the drama conspire to throw together two separate characters that come to complement the unspoken desires and murderous lust that they seemingly share with one another with the eventual courtship and inevitable seduction presented by the director as a surrogate bullfight in its self.Where the film falls apart slightly is in the presentation of the character played by Antonio Banderas a hypersensitive implied homosexual who idolises the matador to the extent that he actually attempts to rape his young fashionmodel girlfriend an act that eventually leads him to confess to a string of serial killings as a result of his mother's enforced catholic guilt. It is a complex character impeccably performed by the young Banderas but his appearance ultimately sends the film off on a tangent that detracts from the central crux of the drama. Though the inclusion of this subplot does allow Almodvar the chance to make a satirical comment on the nature of everything from fashion to religion sexuality etc these themes often feel like they've been handpicked from a completely different film not always complimenting the central story and too often leading it in directions that in the end feel unfinished or slightly unformed. Many of these loose ends can be glossed over while some the last minute implication of second sight as suggested by a solar eclipse really seem to come out of leftfield.Nevertheless these are minor criticisms that don't necessarily destroy the ultimate intentions of the film  which really only become clear in the final scene  or the fantastic direction of Almodvar and the performances of his cast. Although Matador certainly has its flaws not to mention its detractors it is in my opinion a fine little film and one of Almodvar's most original and audacious creations. The performances are all incredibly committed including the central pairing of Assumpta Serna and the late Nacho Martnez as well the fine support from Banderas the gorgeous Eva Cobo and Almodvar regulars Carman Maura and Eusebio Poncela whilst the central idea behind the script and the bold stokes of the director's intuitive grasp of the various filmmaking processes further refines and develops a number of themes that have come to be at the forefront of Almodvar's career for the last twentyfive years.".

The story of two sexual predators and murderers united in life by the passion for bull fights and in death by their passion for each other is acted with accuracy by a good team of actors and directed with an already recognizable style by Almodovar.

	schema:reviewBody "This 5th feature of Almodovar is one of his best along with Labyrinth of passion  Kika as far as I am concerned and if not his best then for sure his most provocative flms. As usual Almodovar explores some of the darkest sides of human sexuality and deals with perversity as dealing with any everyday life subject. For once more the notorious filmmaker at great shape entertains with his trademark raving hilarious politically incorrect dialogs pace and style and while dealing with dark necrophilia or serious religious oppression subject matters it manages to be very funny and entertaining. What's great with Almodovar is that you simply CANNOT label his films. Is it comedy? nope. Is a thriller? nope. Is it a crime film? nope.

	onyx:emotionText "This 5th feature of Almodovar is one of his best along with Labyrinth of passion  Kika as far as I am concerned and if not his best then for sure his most provocative flms. As usual Almodovar explores some of the darkest sides of human sexuality and deals with perversity as dealing with any everyday life subject. For once more the notorious filmmaker at great shape entertains with his trademark raving hilarious politically incorrect dialogs pace and style and while dealing with dark necrophilia or serious religious oppression subject matters it manages to be very funny and entertaining. What's great with Almodovar is that you simply CANNOT label his films. Is it comedy? nope. Is a thriller? nope. Is it a crime film? nope. This is Almodovar so all pretenders go see another million dollar US product . But to all the admirers of unique and original films this is definitely recommended if you can tolerate with some weird humour a bit sexy visuals and nudity and some violence. Matador is ART!";

With Ingmar Bergman it's the detachment from life and confronting death with Woody Allen the comical absurdity of manwoman relationship with Filliny it's the nostalgia for the lost often irreplaceable innocence of childhood. In case of Pedro Almodovar though to put it lightly it's unorthodox sex crazed love stories. love that guy!I had watched three films by him Bad Education Law Of Desire Talk To Her and all of them were rather twisted but this one is defiantly the weirdest love fable I had ever seen or read  even by his standards.The story begins with a young man played by heavenlygorgeous 18 year old Antonio Banderas who is studying to be a matador under a world famous but retired due to an injury Maestro. One night after being suspected of being a homosexual he decides to prove his masculinity and toughness by attempting to rape Maestro's girlfriend. But being in reality a very innocent and tender soul he literally faints before anything happens when she accidentally cuts her finger.The girls reports him and while being questioned the cops hang on him three more murders. Apparently there have been bodies popping up through out the city with all the victims assaulted in the same strange manner  at the height of their sexual arousal they are stabbed in the back of their necks with a hair pin with the same technique a toreador brings a bull down.And now brought together by serendipity the female lawyer who had come to defend Antonio and is investigating the case is beginning to have a sort of an affair with the Maestro. Both of them being obsessed with sex violence and mostly important death which they find the most arousing thing in the world. Imagine Romeo and Juliet only where they both not only desire each other sexually but also long for each other's death.I had personally often wondered why the element of violence is so often present in sex. Even when one makes love no matter how gentle there will be some hair pulling slight choking or biting. To experience pain and dominance seems to be counterintuitive to receiving pleasure yet something in our wiring arouses us by that. With books like Fifty Shades Of Grey' bondage and sadomasochism had become house hold names and practices. But what I can't wrap my brain around is why do these seemingly logically unpleasant activities arouse us?The theme in this film of the desire to kill the one you love and to define death and brutal violence as sexy that is bound to make an indelible imprint on your soul and to stay with you for the rest of your life.".

This is just Almodvar's take on religion and repression. He revisits that subjects again in the film so it must me a theme for him.But then the story shifts to Nacho and Assumpta Serna with Eva Cobo in a minor role. This is where the story gets interesting with the police trying to solve the four murders and the real murderers trying to lay it on Antonio.It gets bizarre at the end with Antonio seeing the killers in his mind and leading the police to them. But they arrive too late as the climax of sex and death occurs simultaneous with an eclipse. How weird is that?".

He eventually meets his match in another character a lawyer that is just as murderous and played by Assumpta Serna. The film is actually wonderfully acted and photographed throughout. The film is crazy sexy outrageous and at times very much shocking. The storyline which includes the wonderfully mad and sexy Antonio Banderas having visions of these murders makes so little sense but in the long run doesn't really matter. Beyond the overtly sensationalistic pleasures that go on  there is a sharply perceptive insight about how people enjoy looking at and even causing the violence.

Those that are want to get into the films of Almodovar may not want to start with this film Try Women On The Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown instead. but you don't want to ignore this film. Serna and Martinez worked very well together and I was deeply saddened when I heard that Martinez died in 1996. He was a talented actor and gave this film its soul. It's great that the DVD of the movie is now available because those that are curious can watch it. The colors are beautiful and it's just a wonder to see. Not recommended for anyone under 17 due to some intense sexual scenes.".

	schema:headline " Pitch black comedy flawed but striking";
	schema:reviewBody "Almodovar meets DePalma in this dark thriller with less 'jokes' than most of his films though black humor pervades the whole thing. All the characters are obsessed with death a murderess who kills during sex a teacher of matadors who lives to kill and masturbates to snuff films and a student who wishes he could kill but faints at the sight of blood. Some of the twists are silly obvious andor copouts and the characters never feel 'real' but there are some great operatic disturbing and funny moments as well.

All the characters are obsessed with death a murderess who kills during sex a teacher of matadors who lives to kill and masturbates to snuff films and a student who wishes he could kill but faints at the sight of blood. Some of the twists are silly obvious andor copouts and the characters never feel 'real' but there are some great operatic disturbing and funny moments as well.

The majority of the characters engage in untoward sexual behavior. Death is an obsession and killing is an aphrodisiac even if it means the end of your own life. The characters are deeply flawed but their horrendous actions are treated as being almost commonplace. I was conflicted while watching the film because the main characters are monsters but the actors make the characters so real that one understands what drives their evil tendencies. It is interesting how Angel appears to be the only character who feels any remorse for his attempted rape. Maria and Diego appear completely self serving without any guilt. Even Eva is willing to not tell the police on Diego if he will stay with her. These characters are monsters. But they are complex and wholly intriguing. We may not encounter these types of people but we know they are out there which keeps us wanting to know what they will do and how they can live with themselves after they have murdered attempted rape or are willing to ignore disgusting crimes for love.Although not as vibrant in color as Almodovar's more recent films Matador still makes use of his love of red. In one particular scene Eva runs down the stairs in pursuit of Maria which creates a gorgeous image and is what we expect from Pedro. His camp sensibility is also apparent in the film as he mixes surprising comedy with drama. One example is when the detective says what have you done and Angel's psychologist Julia says straight faced I curled it while pointing at her hair. Hilarious!Almodovar created a film that would have never been allowed under Franco's rule. You will be sitting there shocked but fully engrossed in this bizarre story.".

	schema:reviewBody "I liked the film Almodvar made just prior to this a lot more 1984's What Have I Done to Deserve This? was a far more involving concentrated and reigned in effort about a group of women living in a cold damp greyed out unwelcoming Madrid striving to get by amidst volatile living conditions and family members. It was witty punchy and taut a real treat. While I'd furiously champion that film if you're seeking out early Almodvar his 1986 effort Matador leaves a bad taste in the mouth a wandering sprawling freak show of a film documenting irritating destructive and borderline psychotic people getting mixed up with one another in webs of love and passion. It is nonsense of the highest order a wandering sprawling piece that treats an array of sensitive subjects in a grandeur and disrespectful manner. Maybe it's about the sorts of items the cinema of Spain had been mostly starved of over the decades prior to the 1980s due to strict censorship but in truth it's a relatively routine drab thriller with a little bit of trashy sex sprinkled in about a misogynist whom it's gradually revealed might be coming around to realise his ways as whom it is his eye catches goes through a routine process of idolising somebody a tad too much.The misogynist and idol in question is a certain Diego Martnez a trained matador who now teaches after a bit of an incident several years ago during a bullfight in which he was gored. He teaches young ngel Banderas the lone interesting character of the film whose impetulance in being a youth sees him overreact and do something daft early on resulting in the film imprisoning him for most of the rest of it. This means we get to focus on Diego and a certain Mara Serna bickering bantering and meeting at all sorts of odd times in odd places as lust and so fourth rages. Diego is a man that likes pain derives pleasure from pain and particularly pain inflicted on women given how much he enjoys the horror film he watches at the beginning. This before we cut to the same gentleman lecturing on how to skewer a bull to a class of matadors. Next scene Mara is murdering a poor hapless chap by 'goring' him in her own unique way a sharp hair pin into somewhere just thinking about sends shivers down my spine. This is what links them you see  sadism attracts sadism the longing for dangerous and powerful romantic interludes attracts the longing for dangerous and power........oh you get the idea. Mara is a lawyer and even turns out to be ngel's attorney after he turns himself in for an attempted rape on neighbour Eva Cobo someone who just happens to be Diego's girlfriend.What begins as a slightly interesting and edgy drama about a number of colourful people interacting with each other on this plateau of suspicions and the questioning of one's identity quickly dissolves into bland Eurocentric dribble designed to shock and confuse written and directed by a man on a thenbrief vein of form that sees him ramble without consequence as the revelling in grotesque content comes across as that of the 'highart'. Maybe to him and some others to the rest it's just juvenile. The film systematically uses ngel to tap into Spain's problematic past and both Diego and Mara as tools documenting what everyone else in every other Western nation are obsessed with in their texts so as to provide some sort of closure on where Spain and its art plus attitudes might or ought be headed. The case study between the two romantic leads exemplified by the two graphic sex scenes Mara is involved in grotty greyed out and uncouth in a run down locale with a nobody earlier on but in a lavish colourful exquisite logfire lit locale later on with Diego.Almodvar has fun addressing the past in the character of ngel a young man that lives with his mother in a rather expensive home having had a Catholic upbringing and we get the sense he's been kept as far away from any sort of temptations however seemingly minute as possible. This is touched upon in a sly moment when Almodvar has him engage with Diego around a billiards table Diego asking for a game to which ngel does not even attempt to rise to simply by saying he does not know how to play. It would seem pool houses items such as gambling and the like have been in no way omnipresent throughout ngel's life. Issues of sexuality are questioned  this representation of the more 'classical' young Spanish male then driven to go out so as to try and rape a girl a neighbour someone local thus clearly establishing a sense of desperation or suddenness in the act built up by anger. But incarcerating ngel is Almodvar's method of telling us he's dealt with that bit and now wants to focus on the scummy leads systematically rendering ngel's strand one of a detective driven nature as police officers struggle to work out what has driven this young man to do the things he says he has done. The film is remotely interesting at the best of times offthewall grotesque and rather stupid at the worst  culminating in a bizarre race against time borrowed from manya past thriller rendering the entire experience a wholly unpleasant way to spend an hour and a half.".

Having failed to 'see' anything in Almodovar's recent titles I thought perhaps his earlier titles would have something going for them. Alas I have to conclude not much. His first film screened last week and this one from six years later are apparently based on the theory that if it's outrageous enough it will be good. T'ain't so honey t'ain't so. This time around we have a Black Widow spider of a lawyer who kills her partners at the moment of orgasm an exmatador who likes his girl friend to pretend to be a stiff every time HE gets stiff a 'psychic' virgin with a penchant for confessing to serial killing etc put them together and what do you get? BibbetyBobbityPoo or pretentious crap whichever's the greater.

Having failed to 'see' anything in Almodovar's recent titles I thought perhaps his earlier titles would have something going for them. Alas I have to conclude not much. His first film screened last week and this one from six years later are apparently based on the theory that if it's outrageous enough it will be good. T'ain't so honey t'ain't so. This time around we have a Black Widow spider of a lawyer who kills her partners at the moment of orgasm an exmatador who likes his girl friend to pretend to be a stiff every time HE gets stiff a 'psychic' virgin with a penchant for confessing to serial killing etc put them together and what do you get? BibbetyBobbityPoo or pretentious crap whichever's the greater. If it's a choice between this and being forcefed ALL the Carry On titles whilst Elton John brays from a speaker system I know which I'd choose.";

Overthetop Western with triggertaut drama  perfectly written by Frank S.

Marvelously shot Ford film with a lively look at the complex reintegration of captives . Ford's subsequent film Two rode together has a similar plot to The searchers though the Ford's vision about West is pretty cynical and less idealist .

In fact  it 's remade  copied and imitated many times since  such as Caravans  Greyeagle  Winterhawk .. . You'll find the final terrible or overmelodramatic according to your tastes  though it's lovingly realized by John Ford who really picks up the drama towards the ending .

	schema:headline " Steiner's Ignored Contribution!";
	schema:reviewBody "The best western ever made is how many regard this 1956 John Ford classic. Its star John Wayne gave his most winning performance and it is reputed to have been his favourite movie even to the extent of his naming his last born son Ethan after the character he played. Ford's beloved Monument Valley in Arizona never looked more spectacular in Vista Vision and colour and over the years the picture has gained cult status. An integral part of the combined elements that makes THE SEARCHERS great is Max Steiner's outstanding score. It is the picture's driving force  its backbone. Steiner's music propels the film forward unifies the narrative and gives greater density to its key scenes. In fact without his music much of the picture's impact would be considerably diminished. Yet I am consistently amazed and at a total loss to see here on these pages  where the best part of 400 reviews appear  that Steiner's music is hardly referred to at all by any of the writers. Not only that but even on the extras of the last DVD release three well established film directors Martin Scorsese John Milius and Peter Bogdanovitch each speak glowingly of Ford's masterpiece but fail to mention Steiner's exceptional contribution. Bogdanovitch at one stage briefly mentions the music and how good it is but never puts a name on its composer. I find this not only doctrinaire but quite bizarre that these three men who you would imagine should know better would have such a detached attitude concerning one of the most perfectly conceived scores for a motion picture. Therefore I will attempt here to amend this anomaly and the afore mentioned omissions and give some deserving credence to Max Steiner's exceptional music for THE SEARCHERS which has well earned its place in the history of cinema.A veritable orchestral explosion opens the picture in the form of a fanfare over the Warner Bros. logo. As the credits roll we hear the haunting Stan Jones ballad Song Of The Searchers wonderfully rendered by Ford favourites The Sons Of the Pioneers. The composer later interpolates this song into his score as the theme for the racist protagonist Ethan Edwards Wayne. Then a lovely version  scored for guitar solo trumpet and strings  of the traditional ballad Lorena plays under Ford's evocative 'frame within a frame' opening scene as the door of a remote homestead opens to reveal an approaching rider. It then skillfully segues into Bonnie Blue Flag to point up the rider's confederate allegiance. The Lorena ballad later becomes the family theme and is especially effective on solo violin for the scene where Ethan gives the young Debbie his wartime medal as her gold locket Oh let her have it  it doesn't amount to much declares Ethan somberly. And later it is arrestingly heard on spinet as Ethan bids farewell to the family and rides out with the posse to begin what effectively will be his great search. But where the score really shines is in the powerful music for the Indian sequences. Here there is a palpable authenticity in the scoring. Aided by the clever orchestrations of Murrey Cutter and some virtuoso playing by the Warner Bros. orchestra particularly in the percussion section Steiner fires on all cylinders adding realism pathos and a sense of foreboding. There are echoes of the composer's King Kong 1933 in the cue for the scene where the Indians surround the posse and the music becomes rhythmically savage for the charge at the river and for the attack on the Indian camp near the finale. The composer's celebrated Indian Idyll which he originally wrote five years earlier for the Burt Lancaster picture Jim ThorpeAll American comes into play and can be heard to splendid effect in the Indian camp sequences and as the motif for Look Martin's Jeffrey Hunter new Indian wife. Hearing these cues one can't help but wonder how remarkable it is that this most romantic of film composers  steeped in the musical tradition of late 19th century Vienna  his birthplace  should be so ethnically proficient at musically depicting the native American. More akin to what we have come to expect from this composer are lovely cues such as the sprightly theme for Martin and the lush and sweeping music for Martin and Laurie Vere Miles. The score  and the movie  ends just like it began with The Song Of The Searchers playing as Ethan and Martin finally bring Debbie home and conclusively the door of a homestead closes on Ethan where a brief fortissimo quotation from that explosive fanfare closes the picture.Alongside the great film music works of Miklos Rozsa Alfred Newman Dimitri Tiomkin and others Max Steiner's music for THE SEARCHERS stands head high as one the finest scores ever written for one the finest films ever made and as such should and must be alluded to in any dissertation or essay on the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "A lone home amidst tranquil mesas. A family gathers on their front porch to watch a solitary man ride slowly up to their ranch on his horse in the waning sun. He stops disembarks and walks up to the house all in one single weary move. Note his stance the rugged tiredness of life etched on his face. This lone drifter is Ethan Edwards John Wayne and is perhaps the most brilliant character devised by Wayne and director John Ford. As the film progresses we learn of his military days his contempt of Indians and most importantly his psyche. Compared to another John ford movie Stagecoach we can see the massive differences in character psychology and within the genre itself. Gone are the days of the brave hero riding in to save the day with wistful smiles all around instead we have a savage man on an odyssey of revenge hatred and bloodshed.In one scene Ethan and a search party comes across a dead Indian buried in the ground. Ethan's suppressed rage overcomes him and he shoots the corpse's eyes out. What good did that do ya? asks the Reverend. Ethan coolly replies Ain't got no eyes so he can't enter the spirit land has to wander forever between the winds. This is by far my favourite line in the movie because of the resonance it has at the end with Ethan walking away into the winds doomed to forever drift the earth. This movie is a beautiful spectacle of sight and sound. Not only do we marvel at scenes in Ford's beloved Monument Valley we also find ourselves amazed at the level of detail in set design. Each frame is as if it were from a painter's canvas. Colour coordination was certainly something John Ford and his cinematographers fit perfectly into. There are few vibrant colours in each frame but those that exist pop out vividly amongst the bleak sepiastained walls of the houses and the valley. John Ford again demonstrates his powerful storytelling technique by using several methods of progressing the narrative. While crosscutting between action is used sparingly a quasiflashback stemming from a letter of Luke's kept my attention firmly rooted to my screen. These different methods of narrative progression are important because it keeps the viewer continuously involved with the story. Not once did I feel as if a particular scene droned on and on for too long instead I felt captivated not only by a gripping storyline but also because of the brilliant dichotomy between Ethan Edwards and the other characters. The Searchers is a lesson on psychology sociology and filmmaking all at once. I love it.".

John Ford again demonstrates his powerful storytelling technique by using several methods of progressing the narrative. While crosscutting between action is used sparingly a quasiflashback stemming from a letter of Luke's kept my attention firmly rooted to my screen. These different methods of narrative progression are important because it keeps the viewer continuously involved with the story. Not once did I feel as if a particular scene droned on and on for too long instead I felt captivated not only by a gripping storyline but also because of the brilliant dichotomy between Ethan Edwards and the other characters. The Searchers is a lesson on psychology sociology and filmmaking all at once. I love it.";

	schema:headline " John Ford shows us how to make a Western";
	schema:reviewBody "John Ford is a classic Western filmmaker though certainly not the only genre in which he excelled employing the classic Western film star John Wayne in perhaps one of the most underappreciated films of our time. Ford builds a thoroughly entertaining movie which explores classic Western themes without necessarily relying on these themes to drive the plot.Like any good Western we are inorexably drawn to a kind of Cowboys vs. Indians saga but Ford manages to draw us into the conflict in such a way that the mere Cowboys good Indians bad aesthetic isn't really applicable here. While relying on the archetypical roles of the two groups to set up a conflict Ford is ahead of his time in managing to characterize the Indians as more than noble savages. Wayne's character's Ethan Edwards hatred of the Commanch is called into question a number of times especially in his stormy relationship with adopted nephew and fellow searcher Martin Pawley Jeffrey Hunter who we are told is a quarterIndian himself and cannot bring himself to find the same sort of hatred for the Indians that Ethan holds.Ethan was a Confederate soldier in the Civil War returning to his brother's Texas homestead after the war. A group of Commanches led by the ominous Chief Scar route and kill his brother's family while Ethan and Martin are investigating a cattle rustling the Commaches' diversionary tactic. The Indians took the family's youngest daughter and the majority of the film has us following Ethan and Martin in their attempts to track down Scar and take back the girl Debbie played by Lorna and Natalie Wood at different times.Such a situation sets up one of the many moral ambiguities that make this more than an ordinary Western the Commanches slaughtered Ethan's brother and his family  he seemingly has reason to hate them with the almost crazy passion that he does. Yet the more naive Martin cannot bring himself to hate them in such a way and the split between them becomes a major point of contention when it becomes clear that Debbie has more or less been adopted as a Commanche the two Searchers chase after her for about five years in film time. Furthermore when the two Searchers actually meet Scar who they've been chasing for years he is presented as a rather intelligent character although certainly one filled with vengance  he too has his reasons for waging war with the likes of Ethan and Martin and cannot merely be written off a the type of bloodthirsty savage that is typical of the portrayal of most Indians within the genre.The film relies on enough classic Western material to imbue with the feel with the sense of such pictures. Aside from the question of Ethan's morality Wayne plays him with classic John Wayne freewheeling confidence and swagger that made the actor such an icon and it comes off quite well. We are also given a side story involving Martin's romance with the hardasnails Laurie Jurgensen played by Vera Miles best known for playing Janet Leigh's sister in Psycho. The relationship is from a classic archetypical Western mold  the two have been in love since they were kids but Martin has responsibilites to his family that stop him from making the proper time for his beau and his rough frontieruprbringing leave him seemingly lacking the proper sensitivity for dealing with Laura though he does of course have a heart of gold.As a side note this film should prove immensely interesting to any serious fan of the Star Wars trilogy the original one. While those films undoubtably draw a great deal of inspiration from Kurosawa's samurai films there is most certainly a great deal especially in the film subtitled A New Hope drawn from here. One scene in particular when Luke returns to his farm after stormtroopers have blasted in pieces is virtually ripped straight from The Searchers. Ford's film is also full of the sort of gallows humor present throughout the trilogy and even incorporates some rather goofy characters the halfcracked Mose Harper Hank Warden and the incredibly overthetop rival for Laura's hand Charlie McCorry Ken Curtis without ruining the overall serious feel of the film but managing to squeeze laughs out of absurd situations such as a fight between Martin and Charlie without compromising the ability to quickly return to a solemn tone. Such deft touch as well as the addition of wisecracking dialogue provided largely by Wayne and Ward Bond here are a large part of what made the original trilogy so successful and it's strikingly similar to the type of paradigm on display between various characters here.Regardless of ranting and raving about Star Wars however this is an excellent film on it's own merit.".

	schema:reviewBody "If John Wayne was ever cornered about what his favorite movie role was he'd be answering Ethan Edwards in The Searchers. Proof of that is obvious he named his son by his third marriage John Ethan Wayne. Ethan Edwards takes his time in returning home to Texas from the Civil War to the home of his brother and his family. But soon after he does the family is massacred in an Indian raid. The two young daughters are taken prisoner and Wayne with Jeffrey Hunter and Harry Carey Jr. go off in search of them. Carey is killed early on but Wayne and Hunter go on for years both driven men for different reasons.Ethan Edwards is probably the most racist man Wayne ever portrayed on the screen yet we feel sympathy for him at the same time. It's been a hard and bitter life on the frontier for him. Just as it's been for the Indians as well. Chief Scar played by Henry Brandon is Wayne's opposite number and he makes clear what he thinks of whites. Two of his sons were killed and he's going to take many white scalps in reprisal. My guess is that Ethan Edwards war service involved him seeing the war of desolation waged by William T. Sherman in the deep South. Small wonder he goes out and starts killing buffalo with a maniacal intensity that Wayne never showed before or since in film. Not an aspect that is normally brought out by reviewers.Wayne's relationship with Jeffrey Hunter is a strange one. He found Hunter as a toddler during a raid on a wagon train. Hunter is a distant cousin of the Edwards family and one eighth Cherokee. But to Wayne he's an Indian. He gains a grudging respect for him on the trail though. But Hunter's there to stop him. The oldest Edwards daughter is discovered dead early on. That by the way is an intense scene where Wayne's facial expressions register more than pages of dialog. Wayne had one of the great faces for closeups and John Ford well knew it.The younger daughter has grown up and is played grown up by Natalie Wood. Wayne feels he has to avenge some family code of honor because Wood's been taken as a bride by Henry Brandon. Hunter just wants his cousin back on any terms. John Ford as he always does gets some good comedy relief of the broad kind in the film. Jeffrey Hunter and Vera Miles who is Harry Carey's sister have a thing going but when she doesn't hear from him she almost ups and marries Ken Curtis. Hunter and Curtis's confrontation is pretty funny.Ford also probably made his best use of Monument Valley in this film. Though Stagecoach and Fort Apache are also among his best photographed films The Searchers being in color is in a class by itself. Proof of that is the scene at the Edwards home at twilight just before the Indian raid. Beautiful and terrifying at the same time.Ward Bond has a great role as ReverendCaptain Samuel Clayton parson and Texas Ranger at the same time. A difficult job for some to reconcile but I'm sure Bond believes that conversion of the Indians is not uppermost on his mind. Bond also has some great blustering comic moments with Patrick Wayne who plays an earnest young army lieutenant.The Searchers is usually found on just about every top ten list of best westerns ever made and it surely belongs there.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Searchers is perhaps John Ford's greatest film. The character studies are rich and complex and never too revealing adding mystery and depth. The location in Utah's Monument Valley is magnificent. The Technicolor is simply stunning. And of course the story set a standard for all action movies to come. The plot is simple and engaging and the subplot allows us to take a break from the relentless search. John Wayne's portrayal of Ethan Edwards is memorable. The dark antihero persona gives the movie an edge not seen in those days. Jeffrey Hunter Martin Pauly and the rest of the cast give solid performances that are very natural and spirited. All of this is credited to the brilliant directing of John Ford. It is a great movie to watch. It is a great outdoor movie that should be seen on a big screen.People say that this movie is very racist and stereotype Indians. I disagree. I think this movie is about racism period. Both races are ruthless and barbaric in this movie. Let's take a look1. The calvary massacres an Indian village. 2. Ethan's hatred of Indians consumes him. But his hatred has a reason. And he is not naturally racist.3. Ethan is a loner hated and feared by his own people. 4. When Ethan and Marty are hiding out in the canyons they shoot the Indians in the back as they retreat. Not very noble is it? 5. Ethan shoots three white men in the back during a shootout. I guess Ethan can do it to his own people as well! 6. When Ethan sees a group of tortured white women who were rescued from the hands of savage Indians he fears for the worst. But when Lucy is found she looks well and cared for. Ethan upset with this unexpected result decides to kill Lucy because she has turned 'injun.' 7. Marty accidentally marries an Indian woman. Although ridiculed by Ethan the Indian woman is portrayed favorably throughout the film.8. Marty and a friend fight for Laurie's love Marty's fiance. It is a civilized fight among gentlemen. Ethan and Marty meet with Scar the Indian chief who abducted Lucy. Scar realizes who they are but does not kill them on the spot. Why? It is a Commanche code of honor not to kill someone when he is at a disadvantage.9. Both races are good and evil in this movie. Ethan and Scar are both driven by revenge. One dies in the end the other continues to live a life of a loner dead in the eye of society. There are many reasons why I love The Searchers. It is a very simple story yet says a lot. It is very entertaining and never boring. Unless you are a meathead who cannot handle anything except mindless action sequences this is the movie that stands the test of time up there with Citizen Kane Vertigo and The Godfather. Enjoy! Watch it on the big screen if possible. The special edition 2Disc DVD set from Warner Brothers is an absolute must. If you are a fan you will not believe your eyes when you see the new transfer. The film has been restored to its original VistaVision widescreen color by Technicolor! On a final note the last scene is pure poetry. Truly one of the greatest moment in film's history. John Ford really struck gold with this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a staunch almost rabid defender of this film. Sometimes I feel as if even those who get this movie don't get it. It goes without saying that the cinematography is breathtaking and the technical points are masterful few who know film would dispute that. It's recognized as one of the greatest westerns of all time by many and gets its deserved recognition on most critical lists. Even with all of its accolades however I feel as if it isn't enough.There's so much depth to this film and beauty to its story its one of those films that gives you new ideas each and every time you watch it. The plot goes far beyond the heads of the pc crowd who see it as racist or oldfashioned although I suspect that some can't get over the fact that this film is truthful. The film embraces neither extreme position that the settlers of the Old West were honorable heroes or that the Indians were always simply innocent victims by evil white men. Rather its a portrait of humanity as a whole and still applies today. As an example think of the relationship and parallel between the villain Scar and Wayne's character Ethan Edwards. Both are racists but both are extremely knowledgeable of the language and customs of the other race. Both were subject to deaths in their family from the other side that led to their attitude both took wives from the other race. That's just one small tidbit that adds to the complexity of the characters and the dynamic between the white man and Indian there is much much more.The characters are multilayered and yet the impressive thing about it is that they never talk about it. I suspect that this is part of the reason it goes over the heads of some who believe it to be overrated because almost all of the character background is explored visually by Ford. Even characters that are dismissed as corny comic relief are not as they seem. One example of this is Mose Harper a character that I for one still haven't quite figured out.A final note on the acting the performances by a few may be the weakest spot in the film and that's with all the performances being very good AND this being the best performance of Wayne's career.This is a film that everyone should see talk about analyze and enjoy. It really is worth it a true masterpiece.".

There follows a wordless interior shot lasting maybe a minute wherein Aunt Martha takes out Ethan's Confederate overcoat tenderly caressing it before she hands it to Ethan. I noticed the sequence when I recently watched the film again and I had to rewind and play it once more because I found it so stunningall of the information and emotions conveyed without a word. I'd watched the film previously maybe a dozen times and had never noticed the power of this sequence.Don't for a second tell me that Ethan is a stereotype because there is so much more at work here. Obviously we are not supposed to sympathize with Ethan's prejudices but notice that Ethan is not the only one who feels that way. Laurie not at all disapprovingly tells Martin that Aunt Martha would have preferred her daughter to be killed after being defiled. Interestingly Martin is oneeighth Cherokee which under the old racial percentages of the Confederacy would make him the equivalent of an octoroon and therefore nonwhite. Martin's intended marriage to Laurie on racial terms would have been as taboo as Debbie marrying Scar Laurie believes that death is preferable for Debbie but she intends to do likewise with Martin. The contrast is that Debbie was abducted whereas Laurie would willingly go. And note at the end that Laurie walks right by Debbie as she heads for Martin.The final shot is famous but I noted the doorway theme throughout the film the message of an open or closed door whether the character enters the door or just looks in at other times the character is inside looking out. And all of this in a 50's western.The movie is not perfect I could have done without some of the comic relief. However this is John Wayne's best work The Shootist is a close second. Those who think this is the best film of all time have good reason to support their belief.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Searchers1956 has been reflected to death by many filmmakers in their own work with main ideas situations and plot as guide.  Many elements of The Searchers1956 influenced film directors ranging from Brian De Palma George Lucus Martin Scorsese Paul Schrader and Sergio Leone.  There are scores of other movie makers whom I cannot list at the top of my head that were affected by this one film.  Obvious film influences are Once Upon a Time in the West1968 Obsession1976 Taxi Driver1976 Star Wars1977 and Hardcore1979.  It shows that great works of cinema are also able to inspire many admirers and disciples.  Only filmsstories by Akira Kurosawa has been reflected more often by film directors than The Searchers1956.John Wayne was legendary American film star and big box office draw by 1956. The Searchers1956 lends creedence to John Wayne being an exceptional actor enforced by his multilayered performance.  In a career that spanned five decades The Searchers1956 is the efflorescence of John Wayne. John Wayne gives a complexflawed portrait of a man looking for redemption and salvation.  One fine moment that examplifies the multilayerness of John Wayne's performance is the look on Ethan Edwards face as he feys over what will happen to his brother and family.  The Searchers1956 was to John Wayne's career what Treasure of the Sierra Madre1948 was to Humphrey Bogart and Vertigo1958 was to James Stewart.Story is about drifting trying find something which is selfmeaningful. Ethan Edwards is such a drifter who is always in search of a purpose.  The Searchers1956 is really about drifting in the American Frontier and search for selfdiscovery.  There were many drifters like Ethan Edwards in the Old West especially in the wake of the Civil War.  The Cowboy drifter in the Old West is almost the equivalent of the Samurai ronin in Tokugawa Japan Era. These drifters were men who were on the go had temporary employment and always wondered about their existence in life.Rare individualistic motion picture in the old studio system days when many Hollywood films were studio controlled.  The Searchers1956 defies the typical 1950s Hollywood film presentation because its a director's picture. Excells on a visual level with interesting camera placement.  Camera framing also plays a psychological and visual role in representation of two conflicting worldsCivilized West and Wild West.  Helped by crisp and flawless editing that flows the plot along effortlessly.  Shades of Homer's THE ODYSSEY are penetrated into the heart of the story with irony.Deals with racial prejudice with honest and truthful gusto.  Racial prejudice in The Searchers1956 is filmed in terms of emotional and psychological depth.  The racial prejudice of the protagonist echos the prejudice of many white people in the Old West felt towards native Americans.  The relationship between Ethan Edwards and Martin Pawley is met by distrust prejudice and sarcasm.  Only towards the end does Ethan Edwards begin to show some sign of acception and respect for Martin Pawley. Shows that people are willing to change if they are willing to confront the dark side of humanity.John Ford was the one director who was able to channel the talents of John Wayne to full heights.  He made it possible for John Wayne to become an American film star by casting him in Stagecoach1939.  The other major director John Wayne had great success with was Howard Hawks.  The Searchers1956 is the greatest film of the FordWayne tandem.  Each are at their highest and most professional peak as film artists.  In film working relationship they were halves of one and one of halves.Ethan Edwards fullfills the requirements of hero and villain in narrative plot structure.  This makes him an antihero with human strengths and flaws so typical of this type of protagonist.  Its funny that John Wayne detested Italian Westerns and yet played a character in The Searchers1956 who fits the mold of the Spaghetti Western antihero.  Ethan Edwards is the closet thing to a villain John Wayne played in the movies.  At the beginning Ethan Edwards lives only for hate and revenge.  By the end he becomes merciful and forgiving.Onlocation photography gives the film its rugged character.  Monument Valley is depicted with beauty mystery and savagery.  The people in the story are represented by their environment and location.  Monument Valley was a favorite film location of John Ford who was obsessed by its untamed and individualistic nature.  Monument Valley site is explored on a physical psychological and social level.  Scenery is an important character of the Classic American Western and none so more true then in The Searchers1956.Another major motif in The Searchers1956 is redemption.  The path of hate and vengeance is replaced by compassion and forgiveness.  Its this motif as well as others that makes the story a subtle Catholic driven tale. Redemption is the saving grace for a destructive and negative character like Ethan Edwards.  Revenge until the climatic moment takes importance over everything else in Ethan Edwards life.  Redemption is one motif from The Searchers1956 that influenced Scorsese and Schrader.Martin Pawley goes with Ethan Edwards on revenge pledge as way of following path of fealty.  The moment of Ethan picking up his niece and holding her with compassion is a tender one.  Jeffrey Hunter as Martin Pawley provides a nice foil to John Wayne's Ethan Edwards.  Cinematography in The Searchers1956 is forceful and graceful.  In time The Searchers takes place drifters like Ethan Edwards are dime a dozen but by the period depicted in films of Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinaph they are nearly extinct.  The Searchers1956 is a milestone in both American and World cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Ford's classic Western has inspired many quest movies and tv series since its release. The film is a series of episodes linked by the 10 year quest for a niece stolen by Indians as a child. Wayne's Ethan Edwards an embittered Confederate veteran shows only hatred for all redskins and is uncomprimising in his intended treatment of his niece when he finds her. Modern cinema audiences may find this uncomfortable especially since western folklore has been reassessed over the last 20 years. But don't let this put you off. Ford's treatment is a modern allegory and Ethan can be forgiven his sins when at the final denoument one act of kindness gives us hope and we feel Ethan has learned an important lesson. Tolerance. Everything about this film makes it a classic and perhaps the best in its genre. Ford's direction is as impeccable as ever Frank Nugent's script and Winton Hoch's cinematography give us some of the classic images of the cinema. John Wayne as ever doesn't even need to act. He just sits tall in the saddle and perpetuates the myth.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is 1868. A weary and battlehardened Ethan has spend years at war. He has becomes jaded because of the things he has seen and done and the atrocities he has suffered. These are never openly talked about but John Wayne's tremendous performance creates subtext. Though rough around the edges he harbours a great love for his brother's family. In one brief shot the Reverend Clayton glances over at Martha who is lovingly caressing and folding Ethan's coat as if it were Ethan himself and this adds an extra layer to the grief upon stumbling onto the burning home a scene later mirrored in Star Wars and prompts us to wonder of their history. The ending is etched within the first and last shots echo each other of that American homestead where some do not belong. Ethan's next step is to gently hoist up the young Debbie and this brief memory full to the brim with love and humanity is exactly what is running through his mind in the climax. After all the settling in and the nonexplanations of his long absence upon finding a home for the first time in years he goes outside and broods on the porch and we again get a doorway shot but this time from Ethan's POV from outside. This one is framed doubly and we see how Aaron walks into the other room and closes its door barring us entry. And so the beginning foreshadows the end. He is joined by the adopted Martin who is 18 Native American but it becomes ironic how the two roles reverse. Ethan has over the years harboured a great hatred for the Comanche so much so that he has bothered to learn their customs and beliefs in order to commit sacrilege and violate a corpse. A cruel and unnecessary act that his own companions do not understand because they have not experienced what he has experienced. You may catch a glimpse of a gravestone which further adds to his tragedy. Meanwhile Martin who by his blood is predisposed and labelled with Ethan's own eyes risks his life to potentially stray onto the same wandering and loveless life that his companion walks but is able to recognise the humanity within Debbie much sooner than Ethan. And so Ethan comes to understanding and respect and makes out his will to Martin. There is further irony where Scar and Ethan stare down each other full of loathing yet not so different from each other. Both have had loved ones snatched away in the endless violence and both have become deeply and viciously prejudiced because of it. Many have noted of the film's age of its outdated racial presentation of the Native Americans. But it is more complex than that Henry Brandon in redface aside we see the various atrocities of the Comanche that lead to the ambush even hint at the demise of Lucy but we also do not endorse them and know of similar atrocities that are committed back in turn and how lovingly and easily Martin has been accepted into the family. Still it is problematic in other areas. Martin is a courageous and passionate character but at times Hunter's portrayal can seem nonchalant bored slackjawed in the heavy accent. The tone veers when we switch back to the Jorgensen ranch where Ford opts to use countless dissolves and Laurie's voiceover and statements of time passing that don't particularly convey time that well. Comedy is inserted here but perhaps it works given how hilariously Miles delivers the line about her age but it is less effective when Martin and Charlie fight in a rather slapstick manner. Another character that is treated with less dignity is Look who could've been an enormous opportunity to subvert the Comanche persona. Martin however wraps her up and kicks her downhill an unusually cruel and bizarre act that is played for laughs as the sound effect of her crashing down is exaggerated cartoonishly for comedic effect and Ethan lets out a cackle.Ford shoots in Monument Valley and it was here first in Stagecoach he forged a lasting and enduring image of the American West that remains iconic in the Mittens and the Totem Pole. The landscape is dusty brown and weary in VistaVision and the buttes jut out of the parched dirt like aged monumental relics without care in the harsh raw sunset as a homestead burns to the ground. As the Edwards residence comes under attack the screen is bathed in this ominous reddish glow and the score becomes sinister. The compositions are marvellous. The first signs of a Comanche ambush are visualised by having two groups ride abreast at a distance from one another the Comanche in single file and silhouetted menacingly against the blue sky. Musical cues chime in to indicate little movements in the distance a Comanche rider signalling the attack from afar and later Debbie frantically rushing over the sand dunes. As Ethan brazenly proposes a nighttime raid for maximum casualties a single rider perches atop the hill in the background peering and keeping watch on the endless plains. And finally the iconic through the doorway shot sharply contrasting the dark interior with the segment of intense exterior light. This visual motif is paraded throughout in the opening where Martha has been waiting for years later as Ethan peers into that same doorway now destroyed in flames as Mrs. Jorgensen greets the two weary travellers and the final moment. We observe this time not from behind a character but omnisciently as others enter the happily reunited couple the rescued girl the relieved Jorgensens but not Ethan. The doorframe and the intense lighting contrast highlights the stark features of a man redeemed yet whose sins have ensured that he does not belong under that civilised roof. He is fated to wander the plains in solitude and in time become one of the weathered rocky relics himself.".

	schema:headline " A Darker Deeper John Wayne";
	schema:reviewBody "This is not your typical western especially for the period in which it was made. It may have John Ford at the helm and John Wayne in the lead but hardly standard fare for either of them. There may still be hard working settlers cowboys Indians a somewhat kooky supporting character for comic relief and yes a happy ending. But The Searchers is harder edged movie than either man usually made with darker themes and a blurrier line between the good guys and the bad guys.The clearest indication that this is no Stagecoach or My Darling Clementine is Wayne's character Ethan Edwards. He's ill tempered quarrelsome  lacks any form of manners or tact and harbors a very checkered past. The latter point is not unusual for a western or a John Wayne character. From Ringo Kid to Rooster Cogburn he's played plenty of men with skeletons in their closets. What is different here is that there's no attempt to distance Ethan from the more distasteful aspects of his past or to explain or justify them. Nor is it ever stated exactly what misdeeds he's committed. Instead his past sort of hangs in the background casting an aura of disrepute over him.And that's only the first impression. After the unseen Comanche raid that is the key to the entire story we see more of who he really is. When he commits himself to a cause he is all but unstoppable. He will do whatever he has to for as long as he has to in order to bring back his niece no matter how small his chances of success and no matter what the cost to him or those with him. And though his cause is a righteous one the same perhaps cannot be said for his reasons. For him his hatred of the Comanches and his all consuming thirst for revenge are motivations every bit as strong as his desire to rescue his niece.And as the film goes on it becomes less clear whether rescue is really his goal. He keeps searching long past the point where even he expects Debbie to be alive leading one to ask if his search has any real purpose or if he continues only because he is obsessed and can think of nothing else. And when it's learned that she is alive and well this brings another question What exactly does 'saving' her mean to him? Because all this time there's been the unspoken fear that Debbie may not be the same person who was taken away. Ethan knows well that many captives who have remained long with the Indians have themselves become Indians what settlers called the fate worse than death. With his burning hatred of all things Comanche this possibility is entirely unthinkable and unacceptable. So the question on everyone's mind is this Would he rather see her dead than be one of them? The first time I saw this movie I couldn't believe that he would ever consider that. I mean come on it's John Wayne we're talking about. But this time even knowing the end I had no trouble believing that he was capable of this. You can almost feel his hatred for all things Indian and his disgust towards a group of 'white Indian' captives seen earlier is unsettling in its intensity. Ethan Edwards is exactly the kind of bitter obsessed habitually violent man who would shoot down his own blood for becoming one of 'them.' He would hate himself for it forever after but he absolutely would be capable of doing it.Jeffrey Hunter delivers another standout performance as Ethan's adoptive nephew Martin. In the course of the film he goes from an excitable woefully naive adolescent to a grizzled veteran of the trail. Throughout it all he holds a desire to rescue his sister every bit as strong as Ethan's refusing every plea to go home and make a life for himself. But although he may be every bit as obsessed and stubborn as his uncle his motives are much purer. Everything he does is for the purpose of bringing his little sister home safe. He does his best to be Ethan's conscience and he will do whatever he must to protect Debbie even from his uncle.Beyond the acting and the themes explored The Searchers is highly impressive visually. The color is lavish by fifties standards the scenery is breathtaking even if it has little resemblance to central Texas and the Indian battles are both excellently staged and historically accurate to a great degree. In fact for a film of the period The Searchers is remarkably true to history doing very well in portraying the plight of captives and their families and the herculean efforts required to recover them. Plus its frank treatment of white attitudes towards Indians at the time and its mere acknowledgment that white people especially women could become Indianized was groundbreaking even scandalous at the time.I won't say this is a perfect movie. I felt that the comic relief although effectively done was more than the story called for. I liked old Mose but I'm not sure that such a lovably eccentric character really had a place in this movie. Nor did I think the wedding scene really fit especially the over the top hickishness of the groom. And seeing that most of the Comanche braves were played by actual Indians I have to wonder why they chose a German born actor to play chief scar. Every time he was on screen I couldn't get past the fact that he was obviously white.These are relatively minor caveats however. The Searchers is a landmark of the western genre and much deeper than its contemporaries. Although I still wouldn't consider it Ford's best work it ranks high on any list of westerns and I highly recommend it to all audiences.".

	schema:headline " On Things Not Seen";
	schema:reviewBody "In most movies what you see is what you get. Everything of significance is either depicted visually or is revealed to us through dialogue or narration. This is especially so in Westerns which tend to have simpler plots and less complicated characters. But The Searchers is an exception for there seems to be much in this movie of significance that is concealed from us. And just as the idea of searching consists of looking for something of wanting to see what cannot presently be seen so too is wanting to see and not being able to see a recurring theme of this movie. Ethan will not let Martin see the results of the massacre Ethan shoots two bullets into the eyes of a dead Comanche so he will wander forever without being able to find his happy hunting ground when Brad wants to know if Lucy with whom he was in love had been raped Ethan yells Do I have to draw you a picture? and Martin accidentally gets himself a squaw whom he inadvertently nicknames Look.But there are things we do not get to see in a more figurative sense as when we use the word see to mean understand. We keep getting the sense that there is more to this story than the movie is telling us at least explicitly for it does leave us some tantalizing clues. For example it is peculiar that an Indian hater like Ethan would be able to speak Comanch as he puts it. It is not as though when he was in high school he might have opted to take a course in Comanch instead of Latin. This has caused some to speculate that he might once have been married to a Comanche squaw from whom he learned the language before the murder and presumed rape of his mother turned him into an Indian hater.The first time I saw this movie I figured that Martha and Ethan had once been in love but that Ethan was not ready to get married and settle down and so she married Aaron on the rebound which she soon came to regret. In most movies there would eventually have been a scene in which their past relationship would have been made explicit but we never get such a scene in this movie because Aaron and Martha are massacred by the Comanches early on and the relationship between Ethan and Martha is never even alluded to after that.The second time I watched this movie I noticed that Aaron is hostile to Ethan. When Ethan asks about a deserted ranch that he saw on his way back Aaron says that they decided to clear out and went back to chopping cotton. Then Aaron says that before the war when Ethan had his own ranch he could see that Ethan wanted to clear out too and he asks him why he didn't implying that Ethan should clear out right now. Martha expresses dismay and Ethan takes offense.Now if we assume that Ethan had once been in love with Martha who then married Aaron it would be strange that he would stick around if he also was tired of trying to make a living on his ranch. He would then have had two reasons for clearing out for it can be downright unpleasant to see the woman you love married to another man especially your own brother. But if on the other hand Ethan and Martha fell in love after she married Aaron and they started having an affair then his sticking around would make perfectly good sense. And Aaron suspecting as much would naturally feel animosity toward Ethan.And once we accept the idea that Ethan and Martha had an affair the next thing that occurs to us is that Debbie might be his daughter and not just his niece for she is just the right age to have been conceived before he left for the war. The idea that Ethan wanted to kill Debbie because she had been defiled by the Indians was already bad enough when we thought she was his niece. Once we accept the idea that Debbie is his daughter the tone of the movie really becomes dark and disturbing.When Ethan Martin and Brad come across some tracks going off into a canyon Ethan says he will check it out. This is followed by what seems to be an unnecessary conversation about firing a shot as a signal as to where Brad and Martin will be wherein Ethan responds that they have to be quiet and he will meet them on the other side. When Ethan catches up with them he sits on the ground and digs his knife into the dirt. Later we learn that he found Lucy in the canyon and that she had been raped. Now if Ethan is determined to kill Debbie because she has been defiled then we have to acknowledge the possibility that Ethan found Lucy alive and killed her for the same reason. If we grant that interpretation then that explains the conversation about not making noise. Because he could not risk firing a shot Ethan would have had to kill Lucy with his knife. And his digging the knife into the dirt could be explained as an obsessive desire to clean the blood off it.In other words it is possible to interpret this movie in a way that makes it darker and more disturbing than it already is but such an interpretation could not be made explicit owing to the Production Code in force at that time. But then this movie could not be made at all today because Indians have been replaced by Native Americans who have not raped or scalped anyone for a long time.".

Once we accept the idea that Debbie is his daughter the tone of the movie really becomes dark and disturbing.When Ethan Martin and Brad come across some tracks going off into a canyon Ethan says he will check it out. This is followed by what seems to be an unnecessary conversation about firing a shot as a signal as to where Brad and Martin will be wherein Ethan responds that they have to be quiet and he will meet them on the other side. When Ethan catches up with them he sits on the ground and digs his knife into the dirt. Later we learn that he found Lucy in the canyon and that she had been raped. Now if Ethan is determined to kill Debbie because she has been defiled then we have to acknowledge the possibility that Ethan found Lucy alive and killed her for the same reason. If we grant that interpretation then that explains the conversation about not making noise. Because he could not risk firing a shot Ethan would have had to kill Lucy with his knife. And his digging the knife into the dirt could be explained as an obsessive desire to clean the blood off it.In other words it is possible to interpret this movie in a way that makes it darker and more disturbing than it already is but such an interpretation could not be made explicit owing to the Production Code in force at that time. But then this movie could not be made at all today because Indians have been replaced by Native Americans who have not raped or scalped anyone for a long time.";

Knowing that Westerns are frequently reworkings of noncowboy pieces one might be tempted to considered that he is watching a rethinking of Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author. But to call the insubstantial standins of The Searchers characters would be going a little far for me.I'm in the minority here. I've heard how this is an astonishing character study. I agree that it's an astonishing study in something but character? Really?Consider about 37 hours into the searching John Wayne decides to shoot his niece because after years of living with an Indian tribe she's become a Comanche! and doesn't want to leave their village. Happily half an hour later she inexplicably changes her mind and he inexplicably changes his and they ride off into the sunset together. That's not depth it's just contradiction.Or here's one at the beginning of the movie John Wayne shows up at his brother's house.

That's not mystery it's just omission.As for the author part well whoever he is he's a bit too stultifyingly dull for my tastes. Perhaps some feel that repeating the same line of dialogue a lot that'll be the day is a great character detail. Frankly I think it's pretty juvenile stuff.Perhaps some feel that the Whimsical Characters in this movie are delightful generally I find that whimsy is where unfunny characters go to die.The author did write in a lot of searching however. And some shooting now and again just to keep things fresh. I guess there's some action from time to time but nothing I'd call an action sequence. See an action sequence involves tension and release surprise and fulfillment. A and B Shooting at Each Other Until the Less Famous Actor Dies has none of that. It's less interesting than watching John Wayne sit on a porch whittling because at least in the latter case he'd be getting somewhere.As for the rest? Well some find the photography evocative although everyone seems to admit that it's evoking the wrong thing Utah which doesn't look a darn thing like Texas. I find that unbelievable for a number of reasons a the most noticeable quality of the southwestern desert is its openness and there's hardly a shot in The Searchers wide enough to evoke any real feeling of expanse b the nauseatingly saturated color is more evocative of Munchkinland than rocks or earth or sky c the toomechanical blockingshot composition gives a feeling of tight control rather than anarchy andor danger and d a number of scenes use weirdly fakelooking sets. They're not particularly stylized as in for example Gone With the Wind or The Grapes of Wraththey're just sillylooking public accesschannelesquire sets.Even the music by the otherwise great Max Steiner doesn't seem to help much. For instance everyone in the movie knows one hymn which they sing cheerfully at a funeral and somberly at a wedding. At least I think they're supposed to be singing it. If you look closely you'll see that their lips aren't moving but maybe in a town this boring everyone has had time to study ventriloquism.I guess I don't understand what anyone likes about this endless exercise in tedium peppered with forgettable characters thudding dialogue and leaden acting. My guess is there's something I just don't get which speaks to many even most. Don't pass up the movie on my account but if you hate it don't feel like you're the only one.".

The instinct to search both on a physical level and within oneself is an enduring theme in films and human lives. An antithesis of the stayathome husbandmaterial persona they also capture a wanderlust associated more with the antihero  the dangerously attractive independent man.Departing from the set formula of Westerns The Searchers explores these themes  as well of those of other sexual stereotypes racism 'the allAmerican hero' and most importantly the dichotomy between civilisation and the great untamed wilderness. Its emotional richness is more that of a melodrama than a shootout between good guys and bad injuns  something that maybe contributed both to its lack of immediate recognition but also to its enduring influence over subsequent generations of moviemakers. The Searchers is revered for the complexity of its plot as well as its technical brilliance.John Wayne is Ethan who comes back home after a long period away. He is someone who has seen life fought in the war knows more about Indians than most people and hates Comanches with a vengeance. The emotional baggage he carries with him is hidden beneath a hard exterior and a big cowboy hat but this is a film that is bursting with so many clues that it demands the attention normally reserved for recondite arthouse movies rather than nobrainer Westerns.Shortly after his return what family Ethan has left is brutally raped and murdered in an Indian raid but his tenyear old niece Debbie is captured and raised wigwam style. Ethan sets off on an odyssey to find her that takes several years. Other family members bandits and the cavalry hang on his shirt tails trying to keep up. If this brutally simplified synopsis makes it sound formulaic be assured that the big scenes are not the gunfights or ambushes but the emotional tensions as our hardnosed characters take us through moral quagmires.The film is also intensely visual. Shot using the stunning scenery of Monument Valley we pass from sun bleached desert to snows that come up past the stirrups. The cinematography is striking particularly in its use of framing shots such as looking out into the sunshine from dark interiors through a doorframe or cave entrance and deep focus shots where our attention is drawn simultaneously to both the foreground and the background.Ethan has a certain chemistry with his brother's wife which complicates things but one of the most emotional moments is when Marty his saddlecompanion leaves his childhood sweetheart Laurie to follow his conscience. Laurie provides some excellent comic moments later on when we witness her barely concealed delight as two men fight over her.As a European watching The Searchers your reviewer was struck by the 'Americanness' of the film which seemed to give realistic historical background explaining everything from the rather barbaric attachment to a right to bear arms unenergetic barn dances that could practically be done sitting down simplistic religion and the tendency to talk rather louder than is necessary. But they are hardly faults in the film and on the plus side if we are talking about Americanness John Wayne's obsessive desire not only to see things through against all odds but eventually to be willing to reconsider his values is a testament to the qualities of that country.One of the most influential films in cinema history the Searchers is a film that handsomely rewards careful inspection.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Ford's The Searchers is my favorite alltime western. To even further appreciate this masterpiece one must read Alan Le May's novel by the same name on which this movie is based. If you do you will appreciate certain details which John Ford made sure to recreate on the screen and most importantly you will get a better understanding of the time line. It is truly amazing how Ford managed to fit so many years into two hours without losing too much. John Ford use of scenery and character development was unsurpassed. It just has everything. The movie opens with a door framing shot on the Edwards homestead. The shot shows the loneliness and isolation of Ethan Edwards John Wayne returning home from the civil war. Over dinner we learn that he'd always been a loner since his brother was married to the woman he loved and the cause he fought for in the Civil War lost but he refused to surrender. While out on patrol the Edwards homestead was attack by Native Americans. The scene with Ethan Edward coming home to see the death and the burn ruins of the home is sheer brilliance and was the last straw he had with the Comanche tribe. He notice that his niece Debbie was capture by them and force to be a wife to its leader Scar. He wasn't going to allow that. He goes to rescue the girl spending years searching for her his motivation becomes increasingly questionable and dark. John Wayne as Ethan Edwards was the subtle darkest character he ever played. He had a serious hated for Indians which the book made clear and the movie less so. If you pay very close attention when Debbie Natalie Wood is hiding out by the Tombstone you can just make out the writing. It shows why Ethan is borderline racist. A lot of people might point that that the movie might be a bit racist due to Ethan's hatred of anything Native American. This is not a racist movie. In fact Ford examines the extremity of racism by the whites against the Native Americans during this period. In fact there was a lot of interracial hatred in Texas and the West. Still nearly all of the violence and hatred in the film is by the whites. The film questions the racist attitude they had at the time towards the American natives epitomized by Wayne's character but still Ford had attempted to justify mass murder for revenge in the film. Hence the dry run at the Academy Awards. John Ford's purpose in making The Searchers wasn't to make a statement about the horrible treatment and oppression of Native Americans. It was to tell a good story. The Searchers is in fact one of the biggest complex multilayered films to come out of the Hollywood studio system. The photography and film subtext is legendary. The Searchers was filmed in VistaVision and movies made in VistaVision look so much better today when restored than other forms of filmmaking at the time. Watch it on Bluray which has breathtaking cinematography of Monument Valley in its best. The setting in Monument Valley was made for westerns. The ending of The Searchers is great without a doubt. Arguably one of the greatest scenes in the history of movies. Ford says everything without words. This scene is simply perfect show and tell. There are so many analysis of what happen to Ethan Edward in the final minutes that raise questions. When Duke John Wayne holds his arm it was tribute to his hero Harry Carey who was a star of silent western films. Harry Carey often did what Duke did in the last scene of The Searchers. Still there are a bit of silly such in the case in the letters being read by Vera Miles in the cabin on the large wooden bench. Those parts dragged a little. I thought the fight scene at the end was a little hokey. The editing isn't that great and some of the props were obviously 70 years ahead of their time. The movie didn't get the critical acclaim when it came out. It wasn't until the 1970s that The Searchers came to serious critical acclaim too late for Ford but not Wayne. Taxi Driver Star Wars and Godfather was inspired by the technique of this film. That's saying something.".

Director Pete Travis tackled the problem of filming a comic book by making something that looks nothing like a comic book and more like an action movie shot on location with a simple linear plot that keeps rolling and never slows down.Megacity 1 is made markedly less futuristic than the comic in order to become so believable that it is hard to tell where the real slums of Cape Town end and the CGI kilometre high city blocks start. I have an uncomfortable feeling that in less than a hundred years cities like this may actually exist.The comic Judge's uniform works on paper but can't in real life  giant golden eagles shoulder pads and bronze name badges hanging off a leather onepiece body suit would sag wobble and look daft. The movie gives us body armour that looks like it actually gets used whilst keeping the helmet exactly the same. The effect is striking and believable like everything else in this film.The plot revolves around a drug which makes time seem to slow down a hundred times the perfect excuse for scenes of ultra slomo explosive bloody and beautiful anatomically correct violence that earn this film its 18 rating. Not a kid's movie at all. Every supporting actor looks like they came out of a gang documentary scarred nasty sweaty and mean. Lena Headey totally kicks ass as the ruthless gang lord Ma Ma calmly relishing the deaths of her enemies eyes sledging from narcotic addiction.In a way this is Olivia Thirlby's movie since she gets the character arc rookie judge Cassandra Anderson assigned to Dredd for evaluation and finding herself on a very steep learning curve. She is vulnerable spikey and tough as called for vital to the movie in order to balance Dredd.How do you play Dredd? He is the opposite of a character. He has no personal arc never changes or grows. He has no sense of humour the comic finds that by placing utterly deadpan 'ol stony face in ironic situations that reflect off him. And where do you find an actor prepared to wear a helmet obscuring everything but his mouth and chin for the whole 95 minutes? Karl Urban must be a huge fan himself to play the part so right. One reviewer described his performance as egofree and it is. I didn't see Urban anywhere in this movie all I saw was Dredd.Me and Dreddheads everywhere thank you Karl. You smashed it.".

	schema:headline " The Best Comic Action Adaptation movie of the year! It's Judgment Time!";
	schema:reviewBody "Dredd 2012 is one of the best science fiction action film adapted by comic book 2000 AD. It is one of my personal favorite movies. This is the character that kicks ass! This movie is so much better than original Stallone film. Stallone's Judge Dredd did not kicks ass Karl Urban's Dredd did! I love this film to death I love it so much and it is better than Judge Dredd 1995 and it always will be! Dredd kills like 50 people in here there are 100 of bodies everywhere I love this action film to death! Lena Headey is such a bad ass I told you the woman can kick ass and she would kick Emilia Clarke's ass anytime. Lena was such a bad ass playing beautiful Sarah Connor in Terminator The Sarah Connor Chronicles TV Series 2008. This movie is a lot of fun. MaMa is not the law... I am the law. Dredd was a better comic adaptation of not only the story of Mega City One but also of Judge Dredd the character. If you were left with a bad taste in your mouth from Judge Dredd 1995 movie then this is the perfect flavor. Tons of action and gore to keep any guy entertained and before you realize it you are at the end. A must see not only for Judge Dredd fans but action fans also. The darkness and violence of the movie is how its suppose to be and the action just keeps building up throughout the movie. Action is well paced and believable. Not a dull moment.It is very violent which I enjoy but others may find it too much. This film is such a bad ass he shots a bullet to the guys face and it melts his face off that's awesome!!! There's a lot of slowmotion in here but let me tell you something SlowMotions in here works there is the reason for the SlowMotion okay. Soon as he kicks the door in and he starts shooting people and in slowmotion you can see the bullets cut in the people's up and that is great awesome! Lena Headey plays a good ass villain man you want to see her ass kicked! You want to see that Judge Dredd takes her up in the air Your going down your going down real good. I love this movie I had a great time seen it it is a solid Rater R reboot movie for an adults and not a children. You can see people cut in a half for a true 80's throwback kick ass Science FictonAction new wave classic I'm glad I enjoyed this film. It deserves much more respect than it garnered in the press and ticket sales. The acting is topnotch a simple yet elegant plot device and amazing cinematography. It may not have made a lot of money or been given the respect it deserves at this time but I have a feeling that subsequent generations will find a hidden gem in this masterpiece. Personally I love Dredd like any other comic character or real person witch stays true to his honor and values of life or society without making himself the exception of his own rules. That's true ideology. Any other thing is propaganda or personality problem. The world has irradiated itself from nuclear war. The earth is all but a barren wasteland with its remaining inhabitants crowded into MegaCities. MegaCity One's population is 800 million with its territory stretching from Boston to Washington D.C. Amongst the crowded chaos stands one force to bring order a force that serves as jury executioner and Judge. On a day when Dredd Karl Urban is assigned rookie Cassandra Anderson Olivia Thirlby for assessment they would get more than they bargained for on her first day. In response to an initial homicide call at the city block of Peach Trees they also discover a drug ring run by a woman called MaMa Lena Heady. But she won't have the Judges taking one of her men into custody. And in an attempt to thwart them she seals the block's blast doors leaving the Judges to fend for themselves as they battle to survive. In the future America is a dystopian wasteland. The latest scourge is MaMa a prostituteturneddrug pusher with a dangerous new drug and aims to take over the city. The only possibility of stopping her is an elite group of urban police called Judges who combine the duties of judge jury and executioner to deliver a brutal brand of swift justice. But even the topranking Judge Dredd Karl Urban discovers that taking down MaMa isn't as easy as it seems in this explosive adaptation of the hugely popular comic series.That is your basic plot it is a lot of interesting titles that make this movie the bleak and desolate scifi actioner that it is. It is a dystopian Science Fiction action flick similar to Robocop 1987. This film works while Robocop 2014 reboot failed! Dredd is a 2012 science fiction action film directed by Pete Travis and written and produced by Alex Garland. It is based on the 2000 AD comic strip Judge Dredd and its eponymous character created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra. I am giving this film A 1010 because it deserves it! I love this movie!".

It deserves much more respect than it garnered in the press and ticket sales. The acting is topnotch a simple yet elegant plot device and amazing cinematography. It may not have made a lot of money or been given the respect it deserves at this time but I have a feeling that subsequent generations will find a hidden gem in this masterpiece. Personally I love Dredd like any other comic character or real person witch stays true to his honor and values of life or society without making himself the exception of his own rules. That's true ideology. Any other thing is propaganda or personality problem. The world has irradiated itself from nuclear war. The earth is all but a barren wasteland with its remaining inhabitants crowded into MegaCities. MegaCity One's population is 800 million with its territory stretching from Boston to Washington D.C. Amongst the crowded chaos stands one force to bring order a force that serves as jury executioner and Judge. On a day when Dredd Karl Urban is assigned rookie Cassandra Anderson Olivia Thirlby for assessment they would get more than they bargained for on her first day. In response to an initial homicide call at the city block of Peach Trees they also discover a drug ring run by a woman called MaMa Lena Heady. But she won't have the Judges taking one of her men into custody. And in an attempt to thwart them she seals the block's blast doors leaving the Judges to fend for themselves as they battle to survive. In the future America is a dystopian wasteland. The latest scourge is MaMa a prostituteturneddrug pusher with a dangerous new drug and aims to take over the city. The only possibility of stopping her is an elite group of urban police called Judges who combine the duties of judge jury and executioner to deliver a brutal brand of swift justice. But even the topranking Judge Dredd Karl Urban discovers that taking down MaMa isn't as easy as it seems in this explosive adaptation of the hugely popular comic series.That is your basic plot it is a lot of interesting titles that make this movie the bleak and desolate scifi actioner that it is. It is a dystopian Science Fiction action flick similar to Robocop 1987. This film works while Robocop 2014 reboot failed! Dredd is a 2012 science fiction action film directed by Pete Travis and written and produced by Alex Garland. It is based on the 2000 AD comic strip Judge Dredd and its eponymous character created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra. I am giving this film A 1010 because it deserves it! I love this movie!";

	schema:reviewBody "The basic aim of Dredd is simple  it needs to be bold true to the source material and full of juicy violence enough to wipe out the memories of the notoriously poor Stallone attempt of 1995 that threw plenty of money at the screen without bothering to work on anything resembling a decent script.The character of Judge Dredd now entering his 35th year in UK comic 2000AD they know it's 2012  don't ask isn't a complicated one. He is as he is fond of stating the law. The time is the future and amidst the wasteland that is America there is a single massive city with 800 million inhabitants appropriately called Mega City One. It's quite the scumhole and the only thing that stands between it and total chaos are the Judges trained for years to be the ultimate in law enforcement yet so outnumbered they can only handle 6 of the crimes committed. This people is as thin as the blue line gets.The film is written by long time fan Alex Garland 28 Days later Sunshine and has had plenty of input from Dredd's creator and still main writer even now John Wagner. Filmed in South Africa on what passes for a tight budget these days especially for SciFi it could be compared to District 9 in terms of the sheer effort put into it with a result that is similarly impressive although aesthetically miles apart. Director Pete Travis Endgame does an excellent job and between them they have turned in a film that will stand the test of time as a superior adult action movie.The premise is reasonably simple something that works well as an introduction to what is in the comics at least a sprawling future world. Dredd is accompanied on patrol by rookie Judge Anderson very well played by Olivia Thirlby who is on the verge of failing her final assessment but is being given a second chance because of her powerful and rare psi abilities. A routine triple homicide it's that sort of city turns into a siege when they are trapped in a massive tower block by criminal nutjob Ma Ma Lena Headey and forced to fight their way out and stop her manufacturing the addictive new drug Slo Mo. Obviously there's a bit more to it than that but this is the basic set up and it works very well indeed allowing for plenty of violence some character development and no few explosions.I can't write this review without focusing on Karl Urban who has previously stood out for his excellent turn as Dr McCoy in the Star Trek revival. Not afraid to go through an entire movie with a helmet on he is spot on as Dredd. He gives us an emotionless machine a man who cares for nothing but the law but a man you want to get behind and cheer on as he splats bad guys left right and centre. The humanity comes from Anderson and it helps that Thirlby doesn't have to wear a helmet herself with the handy excuse that it interferes with her psi abilities. Between them they give us the tired old wardog and the 21 year old rookie on the streets for the first time and you sympathise with the life of a Mega City Judge.Some people have criticized the apparent similarities between Dredd and the recent film The Raid Redemption in which Indonesian cops storm a tower block and much chop sockey ensues. To be honest I was a little worried myself but having seen both films I can happily confirm that they are nothing alike. Whilst The Raid is a pretty intense martial arts film which is rather dull between fights although the fights are awesome Dredd is a tight film all the way through with the plot more than an excuse to go from fight to fight.In conclusion I can heartily recommend this film in case you hadn't guessed. It's sort of like a cross between Robocop and Die Hard all moderned up and with better music. It's no coincidence that those are two of the most kick ass action films ever and Dredd borrows from the best although as Robocop stole from Dredd in the first place it's more like recovering pinched property. The 3D is actually worth shelling out for and there are some beautiful sequences where it comes into it's own whilst the film itself is gritty and dirty although not without a few lighter moments amidst the carnage. The humour in Dredd's comic strips comes from the city around him rather than his own actions and here's hoping we'll see Alex Garland penning a sequel that allows us to wander through Dredd's world. Quite simply a superior action film and whilst it's no masterpiece then again it's not supposed to be it's as good as fans could ever have hoped. Here's to the sequels".

There are also lots of nice character moments in between all the action and some truly breathtaking slowmotion sequences that almost makes the extra price of the 3D worthwhile.Dredd is such a great character. He is a challenging antihero and an uncompromising badass. And don't worry the film does not glamorise violence or justify Mega City One's judicial system. People often compare Dredd to 'Dirty Harry' but I would argue that Dredd is a more heroic character because he would never break the rules like Dirty Harry does. He isn't a hero because he executes bad guys but because he is incorruptible and will always fight for what he believes is right despite the danger of doing it. If it is right or not the movie leaves to the audience.Its such an enjoyable movie that deserves success. Now go watch 'Dredd'. Creep!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by saying I thoroughly enjoyed this film as in my opinion it did everything right. Sure it had no real substance of a story line hence the 810 but that didn't take much away from the film. The simplistic story also had its advantages as more time could be dedicated to Dredd doing what Dredd does best instead of messing around in lengthy conversations. Besides a detailed emotional story might have made this film a flop as the cold ruthless character of Dredd would have been somewhat diminished if that had been the case.So what made this film for me? Simple the fact that they weren't afraid to make it an 18. This lends strong evidence to the argument that if you want to make an action film that raises the bar it has to contain all of the shots that just aren't allowed in a 15 rated film. The drug SLO M0 that is used by the junkies in this film to slow their perception of time allows for stunning and brutal scenes that also look great in 3D. The 18 rating also allowed for the director to create villains that you despise and you can understand why the other innocent characters fear them which engages us as an audience.The film's script is cheesy but if you've seen the other Judge Dredd film that'll hardly be a surprise. And I must admit that Karl Urban does a fantastic job of making the lines still sound good. And overall the acting is good which is a relief after seeing so many action films where even the main character can't act..Overall a great film. Possibly not the best film to watch on a first date but if you know what you're getting yourself in for and just want some entertaining action I really don't think Dredd will disappoint.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1995 when Judge Dredd starring Sylvester Stallone in the title role hit theatres critics derided it audiences dismissed it as dumb and it failed to achieve commercial success. Even though this film has gained a cult following it just wasn't the Judge Dredd movie fans wanted. Now a low key British film company has had another crack at bringing Dredd to the silver screen and the result is a great science fiction action film that holds no punches and gives the audience a gritty gory and surprisingly relatable take on the comic book hero.Karl Urban plays the titular Dredd not the most recognisable or bankable actor working but certainly one of the most versatile. He has a far better hold on the role than Stallone did Stallone gave a performance that was robotic and almost comical. Stallone would growl and maintain an immovable fanaticism to upholding the law strutting about in his ostentatious costume. There was very little humanity to the character and it was difficult to relate to him he was basically playing Robocop.Urban brings more humanity into it when innocent bystanders get caught in the mayhem he's sombre and vengeful. He treats upholding the law more as a burden he would rather issue a life sentence than gun a criminal down. Only when the odds are stacked against him and he has to defend himself against armed goons does he act violently. Urban gets as much out this character as possible with half his face covered up. It's not just an improvement on Stallone's take on the character it's an expansion of the comic book character too.The supporting cast are all excellent and they all give great performances and have strong characters to work with. Olivia Thirlby as rookie judge Anderson deserves praise playing a character with psychic powers is not easy her approach on the role makes you believe everything her character can do. She is not a weak female role either she is never once the damsel in distress and there is no attempt and sexualisation. Lena Headey as the villain MaMa steals every scene she's in a crazy blood crazed woman who almost seems to enjoy going toetotoe with someone as lethal as Judge Dredd. She doesn't care who gets in the way she just loves the thrill of it all. An insane villain who is ready to just about pull anything is captivating and intense to watch i really wish she had been in the film more.The Megacity in this movie is not the BladeRunnerEsque city seen in the 1995 film it resembles a modern day overpopulated inner city slum. This gritty realism is one of the films biggest strengths. Dredd himself is not a superhero he gets shot and bleeds like everyone else this feeling of vulnerability makes it easier to relate to the character.There's no Rob Schneider in this movie oh no no desperate comedy at all there's just no laughs to be had whatsoever. This film is gritty to the extreme people are seen being shot to ribbons blown up set alight crushed splattered skinned tortured etc etc etc. Yet it never feel over exploitative just the right amount. It's just how this stuff would happen in real life once again coming back to the films visceral reality.The film is not without its flaws coming off the heels of The Raid a similar film in premise about law enforcers scaling a tower block to get someone at the top floor makes one draw comparisons watching it. The Raid had amazing martial arts to make up for its slower parts and was consistently upping itself while being as gritty as it could be. Dredd doesn't have anywhere near the impressive stunts featured in The Raid and it makes you wish you had seen The Raid after you saw this because you keep thinking to yourself this scene was done better in The Raid.The slowmotion sections showcasing the effects of the SlowMo Drug are a little overused the colour is oversaturated and these are the only times in the film where the 3D is used to a noticeable degree.Overall it's a far superior Judge Dredd film to the one that came before it and has enough action and doesn't overcomplicate itself to the point where people aren't bored watching it. It takes a comic book that has been tagged as notoriously impossible to adapt give it a gritty and realistic setting and cast some great actors to give the movie some life. I hope there is a sequel because it would be really great to see more of this version of Dredd Urban has a better grip on what the character should be and i can see him taking it a long way.".

	onyx:emotionText "In 1995 when Judge Dredd starring Sylvester Stallone in the title role hit theatres critics derided it audiences dismissed it as dumb and it failed to achieve commercial success. Even though this film has gained a cult following it just wasn't the Judge Dredd movie fans wanted. Now a low key British film company has had another crack at bringing Dredd to the silver screen and the result is a great science fiction action film that holds no punches and gives the audience a gritty gory and surprisingly relatable take on the comic book hero.Karl Urban plays the titular Dredd not the most recognisable or bankable actor working but certainly one of the most versatile. He has a far better hold on the role than Stallone did Stallone gave a performance that was robotic and almost comical. Stallone would growl and maintain an immovable fanaticism to upholding the law strutting about in his ostentatious costume. There was very little humanity to the character and it was difficult to relate to him he was basically playing Robocop.Urban brings more humanity into it when innocent bystanders get caught in the mayhem he's sombre and vengeful. He treats upholding the law more as a burden he would rather issue a life sentence than gun a criminal down. Only when the odds are stacked against him and he has to defend himself against armed goons does he act violently. Urban gets as much out this character as possible with half his face covered up. It's not just an improvement on Stallone's take on the character it's an expansion of the comic book character too.The supporting cast are all excellent and they all give great performances and have strong characters to work with. Olivia Thirlby as rookie judge Anderson deserves praise playing a character with psychic powers is not easy her approach on the role makes you believe everything her character can do. She is not a weak female role either she is never once the damsel in distress and there is no attempt and sexualisation. Lena Headey as the villain MaMa steals every scene she's in a crazy blood crazed woman who almost seems to enjoy going toetotoe with someone as lethal as Judge Dredd. She doesn't care who gets in the way she just loves the thrill of it all.

	schema:reviewBody "Seventeen years ago a Sylvester Stallone scifi action vehicle was released into the world under the title 'Judge Dredd'. Based on the character from the popular 2000AD comic book series the film was a huge disappointment with critics and a source of much heartache for Dredd devotees in the way it seemed to blatantly disregard crucial aspects of the source mythology both in look and tone. Fast forward to present day a world in which comic book characters mean big money for film studios surely enough time has passed to give the old Judge another crack of the whip right? I'm happy to say fans of the comic book should be able to relax and enjoy this much darker and tougher representation of their much loved character. Although the film and it's permanently helmeted protagonist is a straightforward and simple beast it actually works all the better for it. Dredd isn't given a back story or imbued with much in the way of humanity he's instead portrayed more as the mysterious 'man with no name' whose dialogue is limited to oneliners that usually precedes some serious ass kicking. Where the 1995 Judge film was light and comedic this version is hardcore and extremely violent with some surprising explosions of brutality meted out in a world that's long since gone to hell. As is pleasingly more and more the case in mainstream action cinema we have strong female representation in Olvia Thirlby as Dredd's rookie sidekick and a nasty Lena Headey on form and fresh from bad girl duties in the celebrated TV series Game Of Thrones. Dredd 3D can't and won't be considered a classic of the genre but it's a huge stepup from the Stallone version and should satisfy any and all scifi action fans looking for a fun Friday night thrill. Visually arresting and with a sensible running time Dredd rocks. 3.55".

Dredd is a hardassed businessasusual guy with the voice to match. Only rarely did his dialogue verge on the gorgonzola.The film is an unashamed stripped back actioner with cinematography and music elevating it far above genre requirements. Think 'Drive' with the electronic score and city shots but scorched of gloss. DREDD is tough and that's reflected in the architecture the uniform and the hardware. The judges rightfully look intimidating and brutal and the closerquartered combat I felt emphasised this. I also enjoyed the wacky array of citizens a killer 2000AD touch.I've ran right of steam now but overall great film and look forward to watching it again. The film is a straight up 8 but warrants an IMDb 10 out of principle.".

This film does not feel like a comic book film cobbled together quickly with CGI powering the narrative. It is refreshingly dark with a well styled dystopian vision of a future Metropolis. The action sequences  even in 2D  are great. Karl Urban squeezes an incredible amount of nuance out of his character remarkable given that we never see anything exposed other than his mouth and chin. The film is tight and quick without resorting to action movie clichs to move the story along.Overall this film just has that something that makes me feel it will be worshiped in years to come.

	schema:reviewBody "Just watched it on bluray. I'm not an expert on the source material I never read much of the comic books but I was encouraged by some of the reviews here. So I bought it at a discount watched it and...I love it. No it's not a masterpiece. No brilliance in the story no 200M effects budget no complex characters. Instead it reeks of testosterone. It smells like victory. It tastes like the good old times of Robocop and Die Hard. It feels totally uncompromised and rare in today's cinema.I like the simple construct of this movie. When Dredd begins you're thrown straight into the story. When the story ends the movie ends too no hugs or aftermath. The setting is somewhat contained smallish in scale and makes the movie intense. The small effects budget is used well practical visual effects mixed with CGI in an interesting manner. The uniforms are wonderful and the world is bleak in just the right way. This simple story is wellpaced and never gets boring. Also Dredd doesn't pretend to be anything else anything more than it is. It's honest and uncompromising It's merciless and it's solid.Karl Urban has got the perfect voice and chin with that little frown for this character. That's right the helmet stays on. He plays the main character in a certain wooden way that absolutely fits. I don't remember much about the comics but I remember enough that Urban does the character justice. He's a very convincing Dredd and I loved watching him. My respect for him as an actor skyrocketed. He isn't here to promote himself. He isn't here to just play Dredd. He is Dredd. Well done Karl. Olivia Thirlby is Anderson Dredd's sidekick. Don't worry because she's not a female version of Rob Schneider a forced love interest or some useless Megan Fox. No instead Olivia's character is useful humane interesting and brings a perfect contrast to Dredd  the balance is wonderful. Thirlby can act and yes she is beautiful too. She's simply adorable. Thumbs up.Lena Headey makes an excellent villain. She's not your cardboard cutout villain she's more like a nihilistic drug addict. The fear she strikes into her minions especially Domhnall Gleeson's wonderfully played character is not only believable but exciting to watch. Fine job.This movie works so well because there is nothing in it to distract you from what the movie is really about. There is nothing forced. No sentimentality no token romance no questioning of morals no needless twists. On top of that Dredd needed to be a really really violent movie. And that's exactly what it is. It's brutally unforgiving in just the right way. It doesn't quite turn into a gore fest but the violence is effective and very satisfying. These things alone warrant a great deal of respect. We live in a time where everything is PG13 bland and full of some moral or political propaganda of which some people wrongly accuse Dredd. For once we got the real thing.What are the negatives then? I don't know. I can't find any significant flaws. Perhaps the soundtrack could've been more to my personal taste perhaps the weapons could've sounded bigger perhaps some of the CGI blood could've been done in the oldfashioned way...see? I can only think of minor gripes. I wouldn't even ask for a more ambitious storyline or a huge parade of special effects because I like how contained simple and effective Dredd is. Director Pete Travis and Karl the scowl Urban I owe you a beer.Dredd  no bullshit just balls. Enjoy.".

This is a beautiful work of art with a lot of stylized violence desolate alleys with shady characters and ill intentions. The grungy neon lights of a dystopian future the scarlet blood and glimmering glass the hauntingly beautiful slow motion what makes this movie great is definitely the visual aspects.Dredd himself is very one dimensional forcedly so. Stern analytical gruff his toughness masking a side of him the audience never actually gets to see. His character is described perfectly in the first few minutes by his new psychic apprentice which is the last look you get inside of his head before its slammed shut. He is a man who takes his duty seriously to the point that it consumes him defines him.Mama is sadistically brilliant. Her mobstyle domination of peach tree creates a claustrophobic apprehension for a threat far too big to take on in a box far too small to escape. The terror by which she controls the people is believable and vicious. Whats lost in character development is regained by the subtle twisted moments and reactions to the threats imposed on each of the characters.The psychic scenes were perhaps the most well done and paints a very nice psychological battle between the judge in training and her prisoner. I would've actually enjoyed more of these as they were very surreal and artistic. Its also cool to see the way she breaks him down even after he thinks he has the upper hand.Slow mo the drug this movie centers around makes for some very awesome fight scenes on par with Sherlock Holmes 2 a Game of Shadows and the Matrix. The visual effects were very well executed and i myself being a visual effects artist have only one complaint. At some points the blood was a bit oversaturated and toonish which was likely in attempt to match the comic but draws away from a few scenes.".

	schema:reviewBody "After my third viewing of Dredd in 3d I have found something that I rarely find nowadays...a movie that I can't get enough of. It is action packed dark brutal and oddly poetic in its violence. The perfect guy movie. Karl Urban as many have said on these boards IS Dredd...and that is a remarkable feat to pull off considering half of his face is shielded for the whole movie just like in the comics. He plays Dredd with a stoic uncompromising demeanor...someone who lives and breathes justice and the law who can kick anyone's ass at a moment's notice but who also has a very slight 'human' side to him that comes out in brief moments of morality. To be honest I did not see this in the theaters after not really caring for the Stallone version back in the day. The trailer did look very promising so it was one I waited for the 3d Bluray release. I am so glad I took the chance because this movie is so satisfying in everything you could want in an action movie.The 3d looks fantastic on Bluray. The studio used new 3d cameras that really show up on the screen. Thankfully there really aren't many 'throw random things at the viewers face' type of gimmicks but more so concentrates on closeups of the actors showing their faces in great detail. This is critical for a character like Dredd who teeth gnawing grimace must be showcased in order to show any type of emotion from the character.I can't say enough good things about this movie and it is becoming the movie I showcase on my home 3d theater. Hopefully the home video sales more than made up the rather lackluster boxoffice results to warrant a sequel. Check it out if you want to go through a wild ride through the eyes of a regular day in the life of Dredd.".

And please I am not talking about that terrible Stallone version from the '90s but the original comic book series.On the surface it's pretty much a straightforward action thriller but there's really a lot more to it than that and it definitely merits several viewings. Excellent production design and effects but not overdone. It has a 'District 9' Pedigree so if you saw that little gem you know what I'm talking about. It's a hard 'R' rating and it revels in the violence this isn't some soppy summer superhero special for the kiddies... Or at least it's only for those ready to graduate to something a little stronger if you know what I mean.I liked that it was just another ordinary day in the life of Dredd but for us fans it was an epic day because it was Anderson's rookie test  nice work from writer Alex Garland! Lots of sweet little Easter Eggs like that in the film to really make it shine for a fan.Like all good comic book heroes Dredd is simple on one level he is the law. He's an unstoppable force he never waivers and he never fails. But he's complex because in one story he is the hero who saves the day in another he is an extremely mean cop and pretty much the villain. This picture gets the tone dead right and makes great choices throughout. It's lean and mean and exceedingly badass!!!".

Needless to say it was a perfect carrier for the characters involved. Dredd was his quintessential uncompromising self backed up with a very good performance from Thirlby as Anderson. It was great to see Dredd treating this as a constant evaluation exercise even considering the st they had landed in.Acting throughout was great. Ma Ma was excellent but I wish she had had more screen time hence my 9 out of 10 which is harsh considering the budget they had.

Confidential. Karl Urban plays Dredd fantastically  la Dirty Harry and Olivia Thirlby is an excellent foil playing the psychic rookie Anderson. Also worth a mention is the 3D for once i actually enjoyed the use of 3D it really enhanced the films visuals combined with the slomo effect makes for good viewing.To conclude enjoy this film for what it is a damn good action film".

	schema:reviewBody "Most of the reviews you read of 'Dredd' will offer comparisons to the 1995 shambles 'Judge Dredd' starring Sylvester Stallone. This took a couple of core ideas from the comic hero and added some flying motorbikes kissing and lamentably Rob Schneider. The new Dredd is so far removed from the first attempt that apart from the helmet you wouldn't recognise it. 'Dredd' 2012 is a visceral hardboiled thriller where the wise cracks are dead pan and the violence bone crunchingly realistic.The film opens with Judge Dredd on patrol in pursuit of some drugged up perps who are creating carnage on the roads. Any idea of comic book violence is quickly dispensed as a pedestrian and then the perps are dispatched in eye watering fashion. Make no mistake the '18' certificate is justified and the splatter is all the worse for being in eyepopping 3D.The film proper opens as Dredd is summoned to a meeting with the Chief Judge and assigned a rookie to assess. The rookie Anderson has mutant psychic abilities and is viewed as a potential asset to the struggling department but has fallen short of the Academy of Law's pass standard. Dredd is charged with assessing the rookie's capabilities and is immediately unimpressed with his charge's potential. He rhymes off the problems the city faces with the depleted Judge force only capable of handling 6 of reported crimes.Given a free hand to chose their first call Anderson picks a triple homicide at the Peach Trees Block  Huge mistake! This block is the domain of MaMa the crime boss in charge of 'SloMo' a new drug sweeping the city that lets the user experience reality at 1 of real time. The Judges arrive to assess the crime scene but MaMa is ahead of the game and with the help of a cybereyed hacker locks down the building and tasks her addicted inhabitants with the job of dispatching the law enforcers.With no back up available Dredd and Anderson have to stay alive and try to knock the evil drug lord from her perch at the top of the block  200 floors away. Can they survive the battle against the criminals and other forces sent against them? Will the rookie save the day and will Dredd's helmet stay untouched for the duration? As a near life long fan of 2000ad and Judge Dredd the development of this film has been high on my anticipation last for nigh on two years and I'm amazed to say that it managed to live up to my expectations.Firstly Karl Urban is excellent as Dredd. His voice is pretty much how I've imagined Dredd to sound for 25 years and his lip curls and jaw acting are fantastic. His delivery is on the right side of caricature and although he doesn't engage us with much empathy we're never in doubt that he is a devoted and single minded servant of the law. His character arc isn't great but frankly I wouldn't want him to learn about himself in the course of the film  his resolve is unbreakable just how it should be.The rookie Anderson was played by Olivia Thirlby and again she was excellent. Many fans myself included feel Anderson is a bit touchy feely but here her vulnerabilities added to the character and in truth it's really her film by way of character development. Her building of confidence as the film progresses is expertly judged and believable.Of the three main characters the villain MaMa is the weakest. I wasn't convinced that she had the drive or charisma to lead legions of cannon fodder gangsters and her powers were limited to looking a bit thoughtful. Given the down to earth reality of the film this wasn't a major problem but a memorable and frightening bad guy would have made for a better spectacle overall.Much as been said of the contemporary look of this scifi thriller and it's true that some of the vehicles look more 1990 than 2090. There is however plenty of good tech such as Dredd's wrist com and weaponry and the new set against the old does highlight the divisions in the future society.The film runs a lean 96 minutes and although I spent too long looking for the injokes and references I didn't feel it flagged at all. I did have some minor quibbles with the appearance of bent Judges which harked back to the Stallone film and undermined the Justice Department as an elite force but these were negligible.On balance though the film is a triumph with amazing 3D effects and a body count to well justify the '18' certificate. Not for the squeamish or art house lovers but 'Dredd' is pure escapist enjoyment that will see repeat viewings from me and hopefully many others.".

He travels to meet her accompanied by his friend and coconman Major Wingate. After watching her in a rodeo they go to a local bar to make the approach. The Major asks Colin how much is he going to tell her? He answers Oh only enough for her to play her part. And the same is true of the audience. You are only told enough to a identify with Colin's character and his motivation and b follow the plot to come.We're then treated to a brief 'Ocean's 11style' prcis of how Colin imagines the con will play out from start to finish. Needless to say no plan ever works out exactly as imagined!The humour is very dry never inyourface and this isn't the kind of film to hand you gags. Laughing our loud isn't the point. Instead there's a mixture of situational comedy missunderstanding comedy wordplay and great interaction between the characters. Some of the best jokes are the ones where you have to smile ruefully when things go wrong on a bad day. I thought at the time that the screenwriting was a lot like Richard Curtis and could easily imagine Rowan Atkinson as the lead. Instead the best joke is Colin Firth himself playing a little man in Cameron Diaz's words instead of a largerthanlife character for a change playing it straight rarely smiling because he's not very happy he wants revenge remember and not trying to seduce the very comely Cameron Diaz who also plays a wickedly funny character without being cast as the comic sidekick.But from a critics point of view I guess there's not much originality. You can perceive homages to other films old Ealing comedies like the Ladykillers where the subject matter isn't funny but there is some great humour. And I'm not referring to the remake which I didn't like.I'd like to watch this film again at a later time and see if I can. It might grow on me and become a minor classic or it might drop to mediocre. Either way if you watch it you have to appreciate it for what it is rather than what it isn't. And it probably helps if you have a temperament where you can see the funny side in unfunny situations.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is about an art curator who decides to seek revenge on his horrible boss by tricking him to buy a fake Monet painting.Gambit is a delightful lighthearted comedy about a heist that deviates from the plan. The original plan that Harry had was displayed in the beginning ten minutes of the film then the rest of the run time is about how things do not go according to plan. Actually everything goes wrong and the situation becomes so hilarious. Colin Firth is great as a frustrated and disgruntled art curator while Cameron Diaz is charming with her distinctive accent.

	onyx:emotionText "This film is about an art curator who decides to seek revenge on his horrible boss by tricking him to buy a fake Monet painting.Gambit is a delightful lighthearted comedy about a heist that deviates from the plan. The original plan that Harry had was displayed in the beginning ten minutes of the film then the rest of the run time is about how things do not go according to plan. Actually everything goes wrong and the situation becomes so hilarious. Colin Firth is great as a frustrated and disgruntled art curator while Cameron Diaz is charming with her distinctive accent. She makes her character so interesting her mischievous simplicity is a sharp contrast to how she gets things done in a well controlled manner. The ending twists are well executed making it a truly Coen script. I find Gambit funny and entertaining.";

	schema:reviewBody "Colin Firth obviously wanted a less taxing role after stammering as King George VI. In this remake of a Sixties Michael Caine comic 'caper' he plays a disgruntled art dealer who decides to trick his unpleasant billionaire boss into buying a fake Monet. Shirley MacLaine's Hong Kong dancer roped in as coconspirator and candyfloss in the 1966 version has became a Texas rodeo queen  Cameron Diaz doing her best with a onedimensional part. Alan Rickman does an appropriately pantomime turn as the monstrously egotistical tycoon and gets some of the movie's most embarrassing scenes but he seems to be having fun. Colin Firth makes a visible effort to enjoy losing his pants on a ledge outside the Savoy Hotel but the role would have perhaps been easier for Hugh Grant. Stanley Tucci plays a German art expert who may or may not be inspired by Albert Schweitzer. The London scenes are livelier than the scenes at Rickman's Downtonesque country house though a farting dowager moment targets a younger audience than this is likely to pull in.This piece of fluff comes from the Coen brothers who usually apply themselves to something zanier and zingier. If they wanted to revamp a comedy heist movie why didn't they take on Peter Ustinov's allstar Istanbul romp TOPKAPI 1964 or if they wanted to keep the budget down Warren Beatty's KALEIDOSCOPE also from 1966 which had more pace and plot than the original GAMBIT but not such deft performances? It's really only the actors who raise this year's GAMBIT from being potentially dire into something that is merely mediocre.".

The film is very short and when it ends you wonder what possessed the Coen Brothers to make it. Cameron Diaz is extremely irritating and the character goes nowhere. Tom Courtenay was wasted in his role and some of the so called funny situations are too contrived ie when they book into the London hotel. The twists in the tale aren't twists at all just cop outs.

	schema:reviewBody "Webster's defines a gambit as a chess opening in which a player risks one of his pawns or a minor piece in order to gain an advantage of securing a larger more valuable piece or position. This British import remake of the 1966 Michael Caine  Shirley MacLaine comedy caper is devilishly delightful and features the ensemble cast of Colin Firth Cameron Diaz and Alan Rickman. Written by the Coen brothers Joel and Ethan this films lacks the laugh out loud comedic antics that you have come to expect with a typical Coen Brothers production however this film is an engaging movie to sit through and effortlessly hits all the sweet spots that a heist comedy should hit.Colin Firth The King's Speech plays Harry Deane an art curator working for Lionel Shahbandar Alan Rickman a maniacal businessman who possesses little or no concern to the employees that work for him. Deane who despises his boss devises an elaborate scheme to swindle his boss using Shahbandar's biggest weakness his fondness of art more specifically Monet artwork. Shahbandar paid 11 Million Pounds British Sterling for Monet's 'Haystacks at Dawn'. Deane hopes to entice his boss into buying a forged Monet's 'Haystacks at Dusk' replica companion piece for 12 Million Pounds British Sterling in which Deane will authenticate as the real genuine article.Prior to putting this genius plan into action Deane shares his complex connivery with the audience in a dream sequence of how exactly this diabolical plan of action wouldshould fall into place. In order for this whole plan to work Deane needs to secure the services of one more very essential person to his plot P.J. Puznowski Cameron Diaz. It seems that PJ is the great granddaughter of SGT Puznowski who lead the raid on the Nazi stronghold of European stolen artwork which so happen to include Monet's 'Haystacks at Dusk'. Deane is adamant that if Shahbandar is so obsessed and blind to Monet's artwork that he will do or pay any amount of money to complete his collection. However nothing seems go as Henry Deane planned it's a total debacle from the beginning.The true star of this film is Alan Rickman!!! He's funny arrogant chauvinistic evil belittling in other words MAGNIFICENT!!! He steals every scene that he is in. Seriously underestimated by Deane Firth Shahbandar Rickman is a cutthroat businessman Rickman doing his best Alan Sugar British magnate impersonation isn't as eagerly venerable to the dangling bait Deane has to offer.A very cute movie nonetheless I am actually now very interested in seeing the Michael Caine  Shirley MacLaine 1966 original. This film is definitely worth seeking out on DVD Cable or On Demand. Again this is not your typical Coen Brother's slapstick inyourface comedy but instead a more adult refined sort of comedy. British in nature however be warned that some of the disturbing images of Alan Rickman from this film may resonate in your memories for a long time to come.See more of my reviews on FB  The Faris Reel".

Where this show really shines is in the hilarious writing  the insults and comments are really really funny  and in the acting abilities of Colin Firth and Alan Rickman. Both do tremendous jobs. Colin Firth can take impossibly stupid situations the kind Steve Martin and Ben Stiller do situations almost painful in how absurd and moronic they are and yet he makes them hilarious. A guy on a hotel ledge several stories up no pants is old old old but Colin Firth makes it remarkably entertaining as if this is the first time you've ever seen that scenario in a movie. Alan Rickman plays a SOB like no one else and he's the total jerk you love anyway think his Sheriff of Nottingham role because he's just so good at it and his muttered comments and blatant insults keep you busting out in laughs. I got to the point I was jotting down some of the lines in the show and thinking I may need to go back to the beginning to write down others because they're absurd clever and alltogether brilliant.If you need lots of intricate plot twists and details  maybe not for you. If you enjoy understated yet remarkably hilarious verbal humor witty comeback diverting insult and repartee ridiculous colloquialisms and a few sidesplitting guffaws this is the show for you.".

Alan Rickman gives a great performance once again acting with his mouth. Cameron Diaz who is usually over the top obnoxious in movies brings a touching tenderness to what could have been a brash and obnoxious character. I am not sure how to describe this comedy.

	schema:reviewBody "A loose remake of the classic Sixties film starring Michael Caine and Shirley Maclaine GAMBIT is a highly entertaining romp involving Colin Firth as a hapless mastercriminal Cameron Diaz as a rodeo specialist and Alan Rickman as a boorish bourgeois financier supported by Tom Courtenay as a retired general acting as the narrator for the whole film. Filmed on location in and around London it proves quite unexpectedly funny Firth demonstrates a particular talent for comedy simply by remaining straightfaced while Diaz has great fun in an unexpected piece of casting. The plot is gossamerthin involving the creation of a fake painting which Caine hopes to sell to Rickman what matters more is that the plan keeps going wrong. There are some memorable setpiece scenes here notably Firth's parading up and down the halls of London's chic Savoy Hotel without his pants or Diaz's untuneful karaoke rendition of The Yellow Rose of Texas in front of a group of Japanese business people. The Coen Brothers' script contains several hommages to the Sixties while moving the action along at a great lick. Definitely a film to watch if you're feeling down.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had no idea what Gambit would be about when I watched. It was the stellar cast of Colin Firth Cameron Diaz and Alan Rickman that convinced me to try this lowkey film release. And I am sure glad I did.Gambit is a funny little comedy about art curator Harry Deane Firth hatching a caper to sell a forgery of a Monet painting to his own haughty boss Rickman. Deane picks an American rodeo champion PJ Puznowski Diaz as accomplice or does she have other plans up her sleeve?The very British comedy had been written by the very American Ethan and Joel Coen with very wry and witty results. Surely there is no outof thebox offthewall Fargo or No Country for Old Men Coens in this film. This is simple and straightforward comedy. I wonder why they did not direct it themselves.Colin Firth gets away from his serious period films with this film where his character gets into the most unfortunate and ridiculous of circumstances. Alan Rickman plays a very rich formal and ruthless CEO here but we get to see him in a couple of the most embarrassing scenes of all. We will forget Prof. Snape as we watch this. Cameron Diaz again plays a pretty perky girl seemingly lacking brain matter a character she can play with a blindfold but nonetheless fun to watch. Distinguished British actor Tom Courtenay plays the very capable art forger Major who is Deane's partnerincrime.Overall this is one very entertaining film. Those scenes of Colin Firth outside the window of the hotel were pretty funny among many other scenes. It is fun. It is neat. I enjoyed it a lot.".

The performances are over exaggerated and in point of fact actually not CAMP enough! Even the king of camp namely Alan Rickman leaves us disappointed. I mean we expect nuttiness from Cameron but we see here that her Achilles heal is accents. Even I as an Englishman can hear she just doesn't have it which is irritating and distracting. Colin Firth should stick to being who he is and not allow himself to be so directed. To sum up this a complete car crash of a remake which insults the original and should never have reached the screen and it says a good deal about the cynicism of the distributors that they still want to sell this drivel to the public.

Why is it considered funny to see a harmless person abused by a fat idiot? I find it disturbing and characteristic of a weak plot and inferior and unbelievable character development. Which is to say there wasn't any. Firth was his generally understated engaging self and Alan Rickman was his usually aloof and interesting nasty guy. Cameron Diaz played her ditzy self somewhat reprising her character in Something about Mary. But what a terrible waste of good actors. The star power in the film should have guaranteed a better film Tom Courtenay Stanley Tucci  Cloris Leachman Ben Kingsley. And for good measure a couple of hot babes Jennifer Aniston and Lisa Bonet. Stars however for the most part do what they are told and in this case what they were told was of not much help. This has to be the worst film ever written by Ethan and Joel Coen. Are they getting lazy? Or should the blame be placed on the director Michael Hoffman? If you are looking for a piece of fluff that might appeal to people who don't take movies seriously and if you enjoy watching babes and seeing people get hit in the face then you might like this film. But I much much much prefer the original Gambit starring Michael Caine and Shirley McLane. Save your money and save your time and see the earlier one instead. This one is just awful.".

Cameron Diaz still has her stunning figure but her face is looking a bit older. Her Texan accent and hillbilly character are charming enough and not over the top. Colin Firth is suitably fumbling in this comic role  I haven't seen the original 60s version but I think Michael Caine would have been a bit irritating. Stanley Tucci has an amusing supporting role.The screenplay is more hit than miss. There are quite a few surprising jokes and laugh out loud moments throughout. The dialog is sharp and worth listening carefully to. There are unfortunately some jokes that fall flat especially in the hotel. Coen Brothers surprisingly can do a good comic caper script.Even if there is a slightly dated element in it because of the source of the story it's pleasantly dated and worth a watch.".

In seems that expectation management won and it makes good sense. Free of the expectation normally attached to a Coen Brothers' movie Gambit is a delightful little diversion from the banal daily existence that a lot of us are unfortunately stuck with.In wisely contained 90 minutes Gambit offers a simple heist plot that culminates in a small twist that is just about right. The laughs come in a good variety of quality from wit to farce. Playing an arts expert Colin Firth's British wit is a joy to watch and he even undertakes a bit of pure visual humour in the glorious tradition of Peter Sellers in a series of scenes involving trying to find a place to sit down in the boss's office. Said boss is played by Alan Rickman who takes a different route to comedy exaggeration and farce in a nutshell. Cowgirl personifies Cameron Diaz's Southern accent is quite delightful especially in snobbish London. Stanley Tucci's German accent is equally endearing as he plays a rival art expert.Just to reiterate this is not among the Coen Brother's better work but for a short 90minute entertainment the time is well spent.".

It should have been a straight to DVD movie. I got a orange Wednesday offer so i didn't pay for it but i can imagine how my friend felt as he had to do the paying.

The humor is British and this has the feel of a less slapstick Pink Panther type movie. Colin Firth is funny in this but I'm not really sure how I felt about Cameron Diaz. Alan Rickman really plays the bad guy role perfectly. As for the movie I liked it and laughed quite a bit but I can see how some people may not like it. This is not a main stream comedy and is really geared for fans of off beat British Comedy. I am a huge fan of heist movies and this one did nothing to change that.

	schema:headline " A terrible event ... but a moving film";
	schema:reviewBody "THE IMPOSSIBLE 2012 The 2004 tsunami was one of the deadliest natural disasters on record. Because it occurred in the Christmas season and hit many resort area beaches its death toll of almost 250000 was indiscriminate taking not only South Asians but many visiting vacationers. People everywhere were affected by it. My own relatives who were then living in Thailand were destined that day to be on the beach but unknown to the rest of us illness caused them to alter their plans. I personally heard from Thai acquaintances the story of nieces and nephews who excitedly ran to the shore to see the wondrous phenomenon of the receding ocean only to be swamped by its return. Weeks later flying over the Indonesian coastline I could see with my own eyes just how far inland the wave had rushed and the devastation it had wrought.How do you frame such a catastrophe in human terms and present a situation of pure chaos in a way that makes a compelling story? How do you tell such a tale in a way that respects both the lost and the survivors many of whom suffered personal tragedies as well and more of whom bore the guilt of survival? How does one story tell some of the many stories of that day? These were among the challenges that faced director Juan Antonio Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. Sanchez when they decided to put an account of the 2004 tsunami on the screen. Their solution was to deal with one British family on vacation in Thailand from Japan but their film uses that family as a catalyst to show the tsunami's awful effect not only on the tourist population but on the local people who suffered even more.Both the film itself and the filmmakers have taken pains to say that this is a true story and they have aimed for the greatest possible authenticity in the circumstances. They have based themselves on detailed interviews with the family members and with other survivors some of whom actually appear in the film. For example those who tell their tales to Ewan McGregor at the bus station are almost all actual survivors. While footage of the tsunami strike itself was shot in a water tank at Alicante on the Spanish coast and a couple of days filming of interiors took place in Spanish studios the remainder of this picture was shot on location in Thailand using the real places of the story such as the Orchid Beach Hotel in Phang Nga and the actual hospital where much of the action occurs.The actual Thai locations and the many Thai actors keep the production values superb and give this film an authenticity it would not otherwise have. So of course do the survivors who take part whose emotions are sometimes all too real. Many video shots exist of the tsunami hitting the Asian beaches but no one who was not there can have any real idea of what it must have been like to have been caught up by its waters. Bayona has chosen to focus not so much on the massive power of the tidal wave itself but on the sheer terror and disorientation it must have created for those submerged in it and upon the human toll it took. But his scenes of its striking are horrific enough to give some sense of its magnitude even on the screen. Nor does he pull his punches in some of the grisly scenes that follow. The impressive results that display both the striking wave and its terrible aftermath owe much to production designer Eugenio Caballero.The big names here are Ewan MacGregor as Henry and Naomi Watts as Maria his doctor wife while Geraldine Chaplin has a cameo role as a lady who comforts one of their sons on a starlit night. MacGregor and Watts seem to suit their parts but in a sense they are playing predictable roles. They become a couple literally torn apart a father having to search among the debris for the remainder of his family and a mother who for much of the picture hovers close to death. The family's three sons are played by Tom Holland Lucas Samuel Joslin Thomas and Oaklee Pendergast Simon. The two younger boys are cute as well as being effective but that is not really a word that suits Tom Holland. The young British actor displays a surprising maturity and delivers a wonderfully measured performance reminiscent of a younger Daniel Radcliffe. Despite the bigger names involved it is his portrayal of Lucas that carries the picture since he is the hub around whom events revolve as the individual stories unfold. That is a lot to ask of a young actor but Holland delivers.No one story can ever do justice to the events of that day and the days that followed. Nor can a story set in just one location ever capture just how wideranging were the tsunami's effects. How can you tell the story of what happened almost simultaneously in Indonesia and India Myanmar and Malaysia and eventually affected even the African coast. Thankfully Bayona doesn't try. He focuses on the few hoping that through them audiences will better understand the tale of the many. For such a story The Impossible is perhaps a more than fitting title but the film works and gives a view that is both visually impressive and dramatically moving.The Impossible premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9 2012. It will open in Spain on October 11 and go into general release in North America in the last week of December.Ray Lahey".

	schema:reviewBody "It would be impossible to try and capture the widespread loss and destruction of this horrible devastating event. The scope was so large and far too many people lost their lives to even attempt to portray on film. Instead director Juan Antonio Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. Snchez focused smartly on the true story of one family's struggle for survival amongst all that had happened on December 26th 2004. This allows the film to be much more intimate and the audience is quickly able to connect with the Bennett family starting simply with their arrival to Thailand. While the audience was filled with dread in anticipation of what was to come the Bennetts were blissfully unaware and enjoying themselves over vacation. However everything soon takes a terrifying turn as the tsunami hits their resort in a horrifyingly realistic manner sweeping up people as they attempt to flee before it or protect themselves from its awesome power.At this point I too felt like I was drowning. The camera bobs in and out of darkness in and out of the water as the family's matriarch Maria struggles for breath. Then clinging hopelessly onto a palm tree she screams all too realistically for anyone who could possibly help her in a desperate surprisingly shocking moment. It is at this point where she spots her son Lucas floating in the fierce waves and I held my breath as the struggled for what seemed like an eternity to reunite in the water.In a way Lucas brilliantly portrayed by newcomer Tom Holland carries the film from this point forward. He takes on the role of protecting his stubborn yet badly injured mother and in the process he's forced to mature far too quickly. During every moment his emotions and facial expressions convey more than any words ever could as she shies away from and is frightened by his mother's injuries and nudity all the while attempting to deal with the scope of the pain and devastation.However it is his mother Maria whom the film truly centers around. Naomi Watts gives quite possibly her finest performances to date portraying harrowing desperation stubborn determination in the face of incredible pain and agony and ultimately a sense of love and care despite her deteriorating state. True she is bedridden for about half the film but it is during this time where there are these small moments of tenderness and humility which undoubtedly makes Watts's performance one of the best of the year.In fact the entire cast was exceptional including Ewan McGregor the father desperately trying to put together his family again and the two littlest sons Thomas played by Samuel Joslin and Simon played by Oaklee Pendergast both of whose innocence prevented them from thoroughly capturing the extent of this tragic event. The story of these three is intertwined with that of Maria and Lucas as they all struggle for survive amidst the destruction and reunite amidst the chaos. Ultimately this is a touching and heartwarming film as the true kindness of humanity can be seen in this time of great loss. Yes the tsunami is terrifying the injuries gruesome and shockingly realistic and the pain and suffering visible on just about everyone's faces. However the Bennetts' story is a remarkable one of love determination and hope and it simply cannot be missed.".

I felt it would be one of those movies that once the disaster happened it would become disinteresting and would be boring the second half of the movie. I am very happy I had the opportunity to see it. The only reason I did not give it a 10 was I thought the character build up was a little shallow. I would have liked to get know the family a little better before the disaster. Other than that I feel that the movie was fantastic. Once the inevitable happened the film kept my interest and was very compelling throughout. The special effects were realistic and not over done. I wish foreign movies like this would make a bigger release in the United States to show Hollywood how to make a movie especially a true story movie. I felt when I was watching this film that I was seeing it actually happening with no to very little exaggerations. That is where I feel Hollywood falls short and puts allot of drama in a film that really did not occur in the true event. If there were exaggerations in this movie they were seamless and not over done. If you have a chance to see this movie I feel it is a must see movie you will not be disappointed.".

I am very happy I had the opportunity to see it. The only reason I did not give it a 10 was I thought the character build up was a little shallow. I would have liked to get know the family a little better before the disaster. Other than that I feel that the movie was fantastic. Once the inevitable happened the film kept my interest and was very compelling throughout. The special effects were realistic and not over done. I wish foreign movies like this would make a bigger release in the United States to show Hollywood how to make a movie especially a true story movie. I felt when I was watching this film that I was seeing it actually happening with no to very little exaggerations. That is where I feel Hollywood falls short and puts allot of drama in a film that really did not occur in the true event. If there were exaggerations in this movie they were seamless and not over done. If you have a chance to see this movie I feel it is a must see movie you will not be disappointed.";

	schema:reviewBody "A film that captures real life the way J.A. Bayona captures it in his newest film The Impossible is a rare occurrence in filmmaking. Not only does he pay respect to the countless victims that were lost in the devastating tragedy he makes artistic choices and liberties only the most seasoned directors can take. Starring Academy Award Nominee Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor the film tells the TRUE story about a family vacationing in Thailand when one of the worst natural disasters of our time separates them.In the opening credits of the film Bayona tells the audience that the story is true but what may bother viewers and critics is how coincidental and inflated the story can seem. If it weren't in fact true the film would fail within the first few moments. It's the notion that this did occur that demonstrates and heightens the execution of Bayona and writer Sergio G. Sanchez so brilliantly. The Impossible is the most emotional and devastating picture seen since Paul Greengrass' United 93 2006. In the first several minutes I was already in tears. Letting up only for short breaths I feel like I didn't stop crying the entire time. I was invested full body and soul riding among the victims in a frightening state of mind. I could only imagine myself there terrifyingly so and with appreciation now that I wasn't. The brave and committed performance by Naomi Watts is the miracle of the film and possibly the entire year. Watts falls into the role of Maria with perfect precision and accuracy. As a person who's only been a father for a yearandahalf Watts puts me right in the moment of unimaginable fear and pain. An Oscarcaliber turn as I've ever witnessed. The entire first half of the film is shared with Tom Holland a child actor that can only be described as well beyond his years. Holland is motivated and equally as afflicting as Watts. A performance like his can only lead to more roles for him in the future. Ewan McGregor who unbeknownst to me as gone this long without receiving any type of Oscar attention is pure magic. He shows an effortless approach as Henry a father desperate to find his family. If there's one poor criticism about the film it's the first half of the film where Holland and Watts dominate is so gutwrenching and brilliant that when McGregor and his story enter the screen it unfortunately just pales by comparison. McGregor isn't given the most of character development to chew through but it's still an admirable work.Cinematographer Oscar Faura's orange and yellow camera work demands the utmost attention from the viewer gaining a near firstperson view of what could have been. It's a technical achievement of the highest levels. Fernando Velasquez's somber score will only build the tears even more as your catapulted through this reenactment of terror. J.A. Bayona's direction is simplistic but delivered with reverence. A fine directorial turn.This is a film that must be experienced by all. As you lay in your cozy beds tonight take your loved ones for granted as they walk by you and breath the air you so blindly feel entitled to think about if at one moment one single moment from now it was all gone. The Impossible dared me to be a better human being a notion not many films will or attempt to convey. I'll try to listen.It's one of the best pictures of the year!Read more reviews  The Awards Circuit httpwww.awardscircuit.com".

However after that concentrated outburst the drama shifts down a gear to a more intimate personal level which is no less frightful. That is why this film shines it's about the smaller picture. By focusing on the survival of this one family rather than the scale of the event itself a better and more human representation of the disaster is displayed. The performances from the central cast are nothing short of spectacular especially Tom Holland who carries the film for a hefty chunk of the running time with a gravitas that many older actors would fail to achieve. Many criticisms have been made in the press about the anglicisation of the story in reality the family was Spanish. To me that seemed to be a decision to globalise this story to the maximum amount of people a decision that was warranted in my eyes. Thus the main issue with the film was the score to be unnecessarily overriding in certain scenes adding an unwanted sentimentality to the film.

The film is based on the true story of a Spanish family who somehow managed to survive the disaster finding each other and making it home alive although here the family are played as English but they are the focal point. We waste very little time at the start in setting the characters before they get hit by a wall of special effects in a sequence that is impacting upsetting and incredibly tense.Visually there are some weaknesses in the effects but the camerawork covers a lot of them and the sound editing does the rest. In fact it is unfair to list the sound at the end of that sentence like an afterthought because the sound in this sequence is amazing  it is everywhere and it is terrifying even on a home stereo it still works. This is the real core of the film and it delivers because it stays with you the rest of the film as it should. From here the focus is more on the human tragedy separated families death lack of information and so on. This aspects also works pretty well and is greatly helped by strong performances from Watts and McGregor but more importantly from the three boys who are convincing throughout the film.It is not without problems though. The focus on one family and their comparatively happy ending is a necessary evil but it is still an evil in terms of the saying. The film spends a lot of time with holiday makers and westerners and not much with those living and working there they are visible sure but not much more that than. The decision to switch nationalities seems pointless and I'm not sure why they did it  they could easily have made the film in English with Spanish actors without it being less accessible and still appealing to the American market. This doesn't matter too much  but it does feel odd. Considering how well it impacts at some points I also didn't understand why at other times it feels the need to really syrup on the emotion the music is just what you expect and it comes up just when you know it will and it stirs upwards telling you what to feel personally I didn't need it and it felt heavy handed too often.That said it is still an impacting film and is worth a look.

	schema:reviewBody "With it being a New Year I thought I'd go and see a comedy to kick off the 2013 film season. Unfortunately there wasn't any comedies showing at my Cinema so I ended up seeing this film about the 2004 SouthEast Asian Tsunami which killed over 250000 people and displaced millions. Not what I had in mind as a cheery film but oh well....So basically we have a family that include married couple Henry and Maria Bennett played Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts a classic middle class couple as suggested by the fact they spend most their time on the plane travelling to Thailand worrying if they set the alarm to their house back in Japan and also their three sons all string sentences together without saying ''Bruv'' or ''Innit'' so they must be Middle Class. Anyway the family arrive at their resort in Thailand and all is going pleasantly when.....yes arriving in spectacular fashion almost like the rise of Godzilla the Tsunami arrives and decimates everything in site. The family is split in the wreckage of it all and the film then deals with them all trying ti locate each other if they all managed to survive that is....The film was actually very good a simple search story made gargantuan by the amazing effects used to portray the actual Tsunami it literally comes at such a speed and power that leaves you in bewilderment and gives you a better idea that news reports of what it was all like at the time. They also have the classic ''Titanic'' Hollywood orchestra as the soundtrack whilst this is happening just to add to the emotional intensity alongside top notch acting from McGregor Watts and Tom Holland as 12 year old son Lucas. The main complaint and flaw of the film however lies in the fact we hardly see any actual Asian people in a film about an Asian tragedy. The main Asians in the film are tribesmen and doctors who seem unable to apply composure or logic to any of the hectic situations occurring we don't see any Asian characters searching frantically for loved ones or showing pain at losing those they love unlike our Western Heroes here.So overall aside from the debatable premise of casting for the film which you'd expect from Hollywood it remains a good epic emotional film if you watch it for what it is. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "An account of a family caught with tens of thousands of strangers in the mayhem of one of the worst natural catastrophes of our time.First let us talk about the Oscar nomination for Naomi Watts. I get it. She did a fine job here looking beat up and nearly dead. That probably deserves a nomination. But her performance is overshadowed by that of the young Tom Holland who received no such nomination. So to me if he is not eligible she should not win. Is that fair? Maybe maybe not. But that is how I feel  Tom Holland carried this picture.Beyond that I have mixed feelings. The tsunami effects were incredible and I really felt the panic involved. But we have here an English family that gets separated  and they all survive and become reunited within one or two days I am a bit fuzzy on the timeline. Sure this really happened although the family was Spanish  and I find it odd that a Spanish production company did not use Spanish actors. But it seems too clean even with all the danger and death.Sure the film is the impossible which would imply that this should not have happened but did. Yet to put a basically happy ending on a tragedy that killed 230000 people seems insulting to me. Apparently others have called it whitewashed. I do not think that is the case  that term is too extreme  but I have to wonder why we have to focus on a family who seemingly came out unscathed. Where is a family that did not? Roger Ebert gave the film a perfect rating and called it one of the best films of the year. This to me signals Ebert's growing disconnect with reality. If he means one of the 50 best then yes. But I assume he means more like ten best and that is just plain wrong.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another of the many World Premieres showcasing at the Toronto  International Film Festival with hopes of Oscar glory is The  Impossible the true story of a family's struggle to reunite after  being violently separated when the tsunami hit the beach of sun soaked  Thailand in 2004.  The film stars Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts as the two parents of  three young boys that were vacationing in Thailand over Christmas when  the tsunami devastated the country and shocked the world.  With a prerequisite setup of the main characters the tsunami hits  early in The Impossible and packs an incredible punch. As the wave  crashes through the hotels pool area and sweeps away the five members  of the family we watch in terror as Maria Watts and Lucas Tom  Holland struggle to stay above the raging water and within arms  lengths of each other.  Once the water settles the badly injured Maria and Lucas begin a  journey of survival without knowledge as to the fate of the missing  three members of the family. Lucas is forced to mature beyond his years  and assist in getting his mother to a hospital for immediate emergency  attention and is the key to the more emotional scenes that conclude the  film.  The Impossible is only the second film made using new 3D sound  technology the film is in 2D and the crashing and fast flowing water  sequences can be heard and almost felt throughout the entire theatre.  When not fully engrossed in our characters' plights and emotionally  tied to their survival we are thoroughly repulsed by the graphic  scenes of bodily destruction that blood soak the screen. Director J.A.  Bayona is no stranger to horrific makeup effects as he was the genius  behind the camera for The Orphanage 2007 and he pulls no punches  here. Some audience members were seen turning their heads unable to  ingest the graphic nature of effects and few were even seen exiting  while the scenes played out in long detail.  Thanks to the trailers we know generally how the movie concludes.  But just like Ron Howard's masterful Apollo 13 J.A. Bayona still keeps  us at the edge of our seats even with an ending that is both clear and  true to the original story.  The Impossible does have its shot at some Awards glory. Watts and  McGregor pull off incredibly emotional and physical scenes and films  that deal with real life tragedy and the human spirit that overcomes  those tragedies usually find favour with award voters.  But whether or not The Impossible gets any gold plated hardware it does  not take away from the tiring and emotional journey that audiences will  take with their characters. The Impossible is the best depiction yet of  the Indian Ocean tsunami and the horrors that succeeded it. It is also  one of the best movies we have seen so far this year. Packed with equal  scenes of tearful drama and graphic horrors. And although the wave is  the catalyst that propels the plot the characters are so strong that  the big wave that hits the resort will hardly be the thing you most  remember.".

Then they are caught in the destruction and chaotic aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami . It follows Maria and her son Lucas Tom Holland  not knowing where is the father and if two younger sons are dead or alive . However  nothing is more powerful than the human spirit. Who will survive ? It's a grade A picture  a gem  absorbing  riveting  highly moving  incredibly tense . This is a psychologicalsurvivalthrilling drama in which a family enjoying their holiday become involved into a terrible tragedy . It is a smart and sensitive thriller filled with intense drama  thrills  emotion  tearjerker and pretty entertaining though overlong . This nailbiter is a tightlyknit drama centered on the relentless survivalfight  as it follows the seriously wounded MariaNaomi Watts and her eldest son LucasTom Holland  as they struggle to safety . The picture makes up for it with an evolving atmosphere of anxiety and fear . Everything in Juan Antonio Bayona 's impressive film looks so real that you might think it's a high resolution videotape of a tsunami . The crew filmed partially on location at the actual resort since rebuilt where the Belon family was vacationing when the tsunami hit  for the tsunami destruction scenes a scaled model of the resort was used . Interesting screenplay by Sergio G. Snchez from a story by Mara Beln and being based upon on true events  as the real family that the main characters are based on are in fact Spanish but living in Japan at the time of the Tsunami and many of the extras are actual survivors of the tsunami . Lavishly produced by Enrique Lpez Lavigne  Jaime Ortiz de Artiano  Javier Ugarte and Belen Atienza in fact  the producers of the film heard an interview on Spanish radio where the family told their story of surviving the Tsunami and decided to make a film based on it. Topnotch acting by Naomi Watts  for the underwater scenes Naomi was strapped in a rotating chair  while filming Watts couldn't hold her breath any longer and she gave the 'stop' sign. Instead of stopping the chair started spinning the other way around . Later it was revealed that it was a technical error and Watts stated the she felt very scared and hated the chair for that reason. There is the urgent handheld camerawork a trademark refined and perfected by cameraman Oscar Faura  which lends an air of pseudodocumentary authenticity to carefully staged reconstructions putting us right there in the huddle of the action . Furthermore  an emotive as well as enjoyable musical score by Fernando Velazquez .The motion picture was compellingly directed by Juan Antonio Bayona who proved his usual aesthetics and nailbiting filmmaking as well as he formerly made in the orphanage . In this excellent film of 2013  Bayona has directed 1 actress to an Academy Awardnominated performance Naomi Watts Best Actress Lo impossible or the impossible 2012. Rating  Above average  a magnificent film . Essential and indispensable seeing . The picture will appeal to Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor fans .".

	schema:reviewBody "Sufficiently advanced negligence is indistinguishable from malice.  Virginia Fell December 26th 2004. An earthquake in the Indian Ocean unleashes a violent tsunami. 50 foot waves hurtle toward Indonesia Thailand Sir Lanka and India. Coastal regions surrounding the Indian Ocean are devastated. Hundreds of thousands die or go missing. Millions are left homeless. As is always the case with natural disasters the poor and the marginalised suffer the most losing their lives homes possessions andor livelihoods. When the waters recede thousands more die due to contaminated drinking water and disease.Within 15 minutes of the earthquake the American weather bureau in Hawaii warns 26 countries to expect an imminent tsunami radiating from the quake's epicentre. None of the countries finally affected are deemed worthy of being notified. The Japanese weather bureau detects the quake but likewise fails to pass on its information. The Indian Air Force receives news of the quaketsunami but this news gets lost in bureaucracy and is not passed on. Thailand is alerted but officials dare not launch a national alert for fear of causing panic.

Whilst many have complained that our foregrounded characters are white that's not really the problem. The problem's that background characters are likewise. The fact that the vast majority of the dead injured and displaced were Asian never registers. This has an interesting effect. In the way the film panders to white audiences whilst pretending to be about the universality of suffering its message becomes unconsciously that nobody cares and that target audiences identify only with their own. It's not economically feasible to cater to the Other. Of course it's fitting that a film about universal goodwill largely ignores the suffering of nonwhite characters. The real life event hinged on a similar social dismissal.

The formula works well as popcorn  it ably resorts to the usual shock tactics and horror clichs  but is also crass we have to cheaply killmaim others in order to engender the basest of emotions. Along the way we ourselves are dehumanised made complicit in dehumanising those who are sacrificed for closure and our chosen few. McGregor would defend the film's racial politics by comparing criticisms levelled against it to those levelled against Black Hawk Down. But Down was a sinister similarly racist film which posited American Colonialists as victims of a historical situation in which they were precisely the victimisers responsible for all manners of evil namely backing brutal puppet dictators Siad Barre et al destabilising and waging proxy wars with Somlia and Ethiopia genocide bankrupting Somalia manufacturing famine assassinating revolutionary leaders engendering untold amounts of bloodshed arming psychos enforcing media blackouts and waging a secret war on the democratically elected Islamic Courts Union for the specific aim of stopping any semblance of nationhood in Somalia all at the behest of Conoco Amoco Chevron Phillips etc. Black Hawk Down's not a defence it's the problem. 610  Generic well acted whitecentric selfabsorbed FX porn.

	onyx:emotionText "Sufficiently advanced negligence is indistinguishable from malice.  Virginia Fell December 26th 2004. An earthquake in the Indian Ocean unleashes a violent tsunami. 50 foot waves hurtle toward Indonesia Thailand Sir Lanka and India. Coastal regions surrounding the Indian Ocean are devastated. Hundreds of thousands die or go missing. Millions are left homeless. As is always the case with natural disasters the poor and the marginalised suffer the most losing their lives homes possessions andor livelihoods. When the waters recede thousands more die due to contaminated drinking water and disease.Within 15 minutes of the earthquake the American weather bureau in Hawaii warns 26 countries to expect an imminent tsunami radiating from the quake's epicentre. None of the countries finally affected are deemed worthy of being notified. The Japanese weather bureau detects the quake but likewise fails to pass on its information. The Indian Air Force receives news of the quaketsunami but this news gets lost in bureaucracy and is not passed on. Thailand is alerted but officials dare not launch a national alert for fear of causing panic. Two years prior to the tsunami the InterGovernmental Oceanographic Commission predicts a possible quaketsunami in the region and stresses the need to put in place early detection networks.

	schema:reviewBody "This telling about the 2004 tsunami that killed in excess of 250000 people hit both critical acclaim and controversy when it was released . Naomi Watts was Oscar nominated as best actress but there were some outcries that the characters had been changed from Spanairds to AngloSaxons for no good reason . This wasn't a case of arrogant Hollywood changing characters in order to bring audience identification to a true life story because THE IMPOSSIBLE is in fact a Spanish film with a Spanish production team and one wonders why the producers couldn't have put some native Spanairds in front of the camera ? Would the film have suffered if we had Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz playing Henry and Maria ? There wouldn't have even needed to speak in their native tongues Where THE IMPOSSIBLE does succeed is in the devastating spectacle of the tsunami itself which has to be seen to be believed and is a technical miracle in film making . The fall out from this tidal wave which ended hundreds of thousands of human lives is well realised but from a dramatic point of view is very flawed . You see both Maria and her son Lucas both survive the disaster and are separated from Henry and the two other sons Tomas and Simon who believe Maria and Lucas are dead . Of course the audience know they aren't which means we're one step ahead of Henry . Put it like this  the story would have worked much  much better if the story had been told entirely through Henry's eyes where the audience are put through his point of view where he believes his wife and son are dead only to have to the audience to experience great joy at the end when he finds out Maria and Lucas have survived . It might have meant Naomi Watts missing out on an Oscar nomination but would have made for a more dramatic film . As it stands Watts performance and the tsunami scene are by far the best things about a film that's not as good as it could have been".

	schema:reviewBody "A married doctor couple Maria Watts and Henry McGregor has brought their three young boys on a muchneeded vacation to the coast of the Indian Ocean. In a scenic resort the brood fit in for a gorgeous afternoon poolside with nary a Christmas tree in sight and their holiday plans prepared for a beautiful vacation. That day however was not to be the one they had hoped for.A mere fifteen minutes into the film a slight breeze catches Maria's hair quickly turning into a whipping gust of wind. It's one thing to hear stories of tsunamis and the spontaneity with which they appear but it's another thing to see it happen in front of you. No warning. The ground rumbles vacationers scatter and scream their world about to be turned upside down forever. From complete relaxation to impending death. No warning.Separated by rushing water and dangerous terrain Maria and their eldest son Lucas Holland travel as best they can on her severely wounded leg towards civilization and hopefully help. The first half of the film focuses on this pair as if Henry and their other two children were swept into the sea like so many others. Henry however is still alive and his chapter begins at the halfway point when he tries to seek Maria and Lucas out. From then on it becomes about the apparently insurmountable logistics involved in getting this family back together.Technically impeccable 'The Impossible' gives the brutal caprice of nature its due never romanticizing it or demonizing it. It begins as a steady radio dial suddenly and violently spun into fits of static and garbled chaos. Director Juan Antonio Bayona conducts this symphony with a steady hand and a wonderful visual eye. He spins the focus in on a single family caught up in the disaster personalizing the horror and bringing it home in unashamedly melodramatic fashion on its very own tidal wave of emotion. While doing so Bayona creates one of the most traumatizing and realistic disaster sequences in history. Avoiding the temptation to fill his piece with dramatic underscore that swells as our protagonists are tumbled in the muddy waters of the invading ocean Bayona removes all musical accompaniment for this portion permitting loudness and utter silence to fill our senses along with visual stimuli that will leave you scarcely able to breathe. This swift wrath of nature is expertly realized but the heart of the film is in its characters and how they respond to the betrayal of the world around them.Naomi Watts in her career best performance expresses the rooted emotions of a mother both physically and emotionally filling the film with so much fearlessness and unshakable motivation that she enraptures the audience with her survival instincts. Ewan McGregor provides able support as the distressed father and is extremely competent. Tom Holland delivers one of the strongest juvenile debuts seen in years conveying a complex series of emotions with natural serenity.The Impossible separates itself from the other disaster films by focusing not just on the scale of the mayhem but the intimacy of the struggle. Yes it takes us back to an epic nightmare that was the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004 but the flashback is vertiginous and horrible and oddly poetic.".

	schema:headline " An uplifting movie with great performances";
	schema:reviewBody "The most scary bit for me was when I came up and I was all on my own.The Impossible is Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona's follow up to his 2007 hit El Orfanato The Orphanage. He has decided to change the genre but still manages to direct a great film. This is a very powerful and emotional family drama about the true story of the tsunami that hit the coast of Asia in 2004 and a family's struggle for survival. The film is based on the main character's story Maria Belon and the screenplay was adapted by Sergio Sanchez who had previously worked with Bayona in The Orphanage as well. The story was really well developed although sometimes the film felt a little over the top with the melodrama. Films always add a few elements to spice up the story a bit so I can't say how true this movie is to what actually happened in real life but what I can say is that the Spanish family this film is based on is played here by a British one so there are some changes. Anyway The Impossible works really well as a family drama and many people left the theater with tears in their eyes. This is a tearjerker so if you're an emotional person this film will pull your strings especially through Naomi Watts's performance who gives a powerful and a very physically challenging one. Her Oscar nomination was very well earned although she probably won't be the winner. The film also succeeds in the technical aspect as the tsunami is beautifully shot and one of the greatest scenes in the movie considering it is one of the worst national catastrophes of our time. The imagery will remain in your head.Henry Ewan McGregor and Maria Naomi Watts travel to Thailand for their Christmas holidays alongside their three children Lucas Tom Holland Thomas Samuel Joslin and Simon Oaklee Pendergast. They are having the perfect family vacation in the beautiful coastline of Thailand in a lovely villa. Along with several other tourists they spend Christmas Eve together and the next morning the kids open their gifts. Everything seems to be going lovely and then all of a sudden out of the blue a giant wave comes roaring across the entire coastline taking everything along its path. We follow the wave as it washes over the entire place then the camera follows Maria and Lucas as the current has washed them far away from the villa. Maria is badly injured but she is glad to have Lucas by her side. This is the story of their fight for survival and struggle to reunite with the rest of their family. The tsunami scene is terrifying as we see the terrible effects it had on the population and isn't an easy watch but it is worth it because it has an uplifting story.Naomi Watts has been receiving a lot of recognition for her work in this film and she is truly amazing but I thought Ewan McGregor also delivers a great performance as well and many people have ignored him. The children in this film are also great here especially Tom Holland who should have received a nomination for his work in this film. He shares a great chemistry with Naomi Watts and holds up his performance to hers. My only complaint for this movie is that it goes overboard with the melodrama and intends to have everyone leave the theater with tears in their eyes but it truly is an uplifting story. It is worth the watch and I recommend it because it reminds us that with faith we can achieve impossible things and that we shouldn't take things for granted because things can change drastically from one moment to the next. Life is fragile but love can conquer all. httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I just don't understand how this movie got good reviews.Imagine if James Cameron had filmed The Titanic entirely as closeups of people suffering in the hallways!!! Thats how the makers of The Impossible would have done The Titanic!!!! Closeups of people suffering as the hallways filled with water then closeups of people suffering in lifeboats. With an initial 10 second opening shot of the ship the ocean and other passengers. I expected that this movie would be about one family's experiences set against a backdrop of unique natural tragedy that caused 400000 deaths and left 50000 homeless. After all thats what made their story unique. Unfortunately the makers of this film pretty much omitted the tsunami from this movie. Also omitted the ocean beaches and all the people in Asia. While the actual tsunami was a natural catastrophe of epic proportions occurring in one of the worlds most exotic beautiful and tranquil locations the tsunami is only seen in this film as a wave entering the swimming pool area of the hotel. After that its pretty much all closeups of Naomi Watts suffering and screaming. Except for the cuts and bruises she could be in any puddle of water say in a bad rain at a Florida Motel. Strangely even though hundreds of thousands of other people were swept away Watts is always alone under muddy water walking out of a swamp sitting in a tree. She and her son are pretty much the only ones in the first half of the movie. Nor are there any buildings cars or anything else that might have been hit by the wave. When she reaches the hospital there are a couple of dozen extras to represent the million people injured and dead. The hospital scene could have been filmed on Saturday night at any Brooklyn Hospital except that in the movie the scene was too calm. After 45 minutes of this we get closeups of Ewan McGregor yelling and suffering. Thats pretty much it yelling and suffering with cameras on their faces almost never a reference to the scale and circumstances of the unique and colossal tragedy thats the basis for this film. We're left with one family having a bad day somewhere with palm trees.".

I'm not sure if this was intentional but there were no trailers before the movie so being thrown strait into the film unexpectedly with people whispering is this it then ? only helping build up some initial tension and excitement.The film starts nicely but with overtones of spy thrillers like Day of the Jackal coming to mind. Neeson seems a bit pityful at the start but soon overturns that impression with a taste of his handywork after around ten minutes of the thriller.Then before you know it it's over. 93 minutes gone in a blur of fighting fear chasing and excitement at serious pace. The artwork and direction is nicely done giving you the feeling of being the one attacking and the chair squirming feeling of being the poor gits who get annihilated in almost every way possible.It was one of those films that I wanted to applause after the film I actually clapped about three times but noone joined in... too afraid of being the only two people clapping I suppose...Neeson was great and I can't wait to see the movie many more times. I only gave it 9 out of 10 as it was too short ! The film could have been easily stretched to 2 hours in my opinion with some more development and intimacy with the characters. But I guess this may have not made it so exciting... still well worth the money to see this in the big screen.".

It is the way he does what he does the way that he fights and overcomes problems that draws you into the movie and makes this movie so great to watch.Liam Neeson is such a great cast for the main character he delivers an outstanding performance. I love to see an actor that can portray themself in anyway a good guy or a bad guy and in this film he fights for his daughter and he will not stop for anything. You love to watch him seek revenge and feel for him the whole time maybe just because its Liam Neeson can you help yourself from loving this guy?

Liam Neeson's character is the angry love child of BourneBond and all the other pretenders put together. If I was asked to cast the movie I guess he wouldn't have been my first choice but having seen it I can't think of anyone else I'd rather have in the role. The fight choreography is bone crunchingly good. This is one kick ass flick and one I will definitely buy on DVD. There's little doubt who the bad guys are and they get a very satisfactory smack in the mouth  when they aren't being shot or electrocuted. This was made by people who like the genre and know how to get an action movie from A to Z. I can't help but giggle at those reviews that mention plot and probability in this kind of movie. What kind of movie did they think they were going to see?".

In the beginning it seems that it was going to be an easy to watch movie but after a short time it turned into a highspeed action movie. I found the story original and so did my friends. At some times I found it hard to watch because of the drug abuse and violence. To know that these practices still occur also gave me a horrible feeling. I was completely taken away by this movie. At some points it was very very quiet in the cinema because of the excitement you wonder what is going to happen next. Some moments in the story I found a bit not convincing but the rest of the movie makes up to that. Liam Neeson in one of his best performances. It had good action a good story some humor. There are also some sensitive  sentimental scenes. There are no plot twists. It is just a story being told. This is one of those movies which stay in your memory for a while and let you think about bad things that happen. The movie that had that same effect on me was Traffic 2000. Personally I think this movie is underrated but maybe this is because it is new. I would give it 810.".

I went to this movie knowing that one of the writers and the director were both French and since I've seen some notsoimpressive movies almost fell asleep i was really skeptical.BUT this one proved to be a great action movie. The best movie to compare with Taken is Hitman. The idea is somewhat the same lots of action shots flying bullets etc  though the motive for the actions are not money. But the level of realism the motivation of the character the cold blood which moves him on makes this flick a good option to choose when selecting a movie.Liam Neeson does a great performance perfectly interpreting his role of a former spy. As he says in one of his lines he's retired but not dead having an opportunity to show everyone what he knows to do best.The movie covers a hot topic too kidnapping young women to force them to prostitute and all the business this involves. You get to see the kind of people are supporting these arrangements and what it takes for the victims to be there.Of course the movie has very small almost invisible drawbacks like some lines in a wrong language english instead of french and some Rambo  stuff but the overall impression is simple a strong recommendation!".

Not much else to the story.Basically a girl from a well off background gets trapped into the sex slavery market through kidnapping and drugs while visiting Paris.The Daddy is some sort of superman super spy who now works as a body guard. He knows all about the world and was immediately worried when his daughter set off to spend some time in Europe with a friend. He knows how dangerous the world is and of course in the traditional Daddy knows best theme... it turns out that France IS a dangerous country. So then daddy turns into superman secret agent and kicks butt all over Europe.If you don't mind pointless violence like French bashing the obligatory Arabic sounding bad guys or if you think that outrage over a daughters abduction justifies torture murder and other atrocities shoting some French cop's wife than well perhaps this is your film.Personally I vacillated between laughing at the stupidity of the premise thrilled at the display of martial arts and at the same time disgusted over the film's violence.Regarding the stupidity of the premise I should explain that there is a terrible irony in the depiction of Europe as dangerous when the murder rate is 3.6 times higher in the US than in France. In addition sexual slavery often involves importing 3rd world women into the US and into France for that matter not kidnapping well off US kids in France.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since the entire plot of this film is given away in the masterfully delivered trailer it's not divulging anything to say that Taken is a modernday revenge thriller. This presents an interesting experiment actually. Considering that there aren't really any surprises to be found in Taken beyond those we were offered in the prerelease snippet are splendidly realized action sequences enough to carry this film? The answer here is a resounding yes. Taken may be a simple film but it's not simplistic and even though the first third of it is spent recapping what we knew going in the second and third acts here deliver enough thrills and action to make this film riveting even if we know exactly where it's going.By setting the chase within the ultrasleazy world of human trafficking which we secretly hope is just a media creation but know deep inside that this reprehensible and inhumane phenomenon is a reality the film is propelled by a sense of urgency that isn't present in most revenge films. Liam Neeson's daughter isn't Dead she's Taken so his race against the ticking stopwatch tracking her probable fate provides enough tension to diffuse any disappointment in knowing exactly what's going to happen here.The selling point here is how deftly Liam Neeson hacks his way through a bevy of Albanian baddies. Neeson is untested as an action star but watching him maneuver his way through the sea of detritus here we're left hoping that he's got a franchise in him.The film may not have the intricacies of the expertly crafted Bourne films although like every action film made since Bourne appeared on the screen the fight scenes here owe an obviously rich debt to Matt Damon's antics but the gritty and realistic path Neeson carves to get to his stolen daughter is sufficient to deliver the promise implied by the fantastic trailer.You don't have to be a parent to understand and sympathize with Liam's plight here and there is a morbid but exhilarating sense of release in seeing the evil empire pay for its transgressions. Sometimes morally complex ambiguous studies of man's desire for revenge are too preachy to be entertaining. Taken doesn't really care if you like Liam Neeson or wonder if he's doing the right thing by flagrantly taking the law into his own hands the film just wants you to strap yourself in and enjoy the tidings as he hands out beatdowns all over Paris.This film doesn't want you to think. Like Neeson's character quickly realizes thinking is often not a luxury present in dire circumstances like these. Action is what counts and for those who miss the era of the lean mean 85minute skullcrack fest Taken will reconjure the giddy thrills of watching Dudikoff Seagal and VanDamme chomp through a slew of BMovie terrorists. Having an Oscarcaliber actor delivering the judo chops only sweetens the pot.Forget about Oscars plot points or coherence. This dude's daughter has been kidnapped and he's a former government agent trained to make bad guys' lives a living hell. Do you want to see him find his daughter and take down the scum who took her? Of course you do. Even reading this review is overanalyzing it.".

With Liam already pd off enough as it is he fights his way through Paris to find his missing girl. And whilst the story seems like a pessimistic tale of a heartbroken father searching for his daughter it really isn't just that! The action elements of the movie are truly compelling whilst I was tempted to go and grab for my tea on the floor below my sofa I simply could not. Every chance Liam had at smashing heads into the wall or quite simply teaching them a lesson he did it with such might and fury not for the fainthearted so missing a second would be enough to miss it all.So in conclusion the father did succeed in finding his daughter in the end and they did live on but as a consequence to killing all those people to get to his daughter all the relatives sent out to kill him in the sequel Taken 2. But I think we can all agree that T2 can be a film we can just forget about with it's quite simply sloppy story and confusing motive. It was just a disaster on many levels.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went with very few expectations despite being a fan of Neeson and Besson. I came out pleasantly surprised. The film is very much in the Bourne trilogy mold  Neeson's character is a beenthereseenitall former CIA agent who knows all the tricks and is also a dab hand at dispatching henchmen quickly and effectively.Another reviewer while giving the movie 110 noted all the clichs in the movie. That is true pretty much everyone is a composite of previous action movie stock characters. The acting is pretty wooden at times and Neeson's American accent as usual doesn't overly impress.I say above could've been even better and sadly it does seem like this was an opportunity missed to make a movie that would challenge Bourne. Sadly it falls short there. The action is excellent Neeson is a very believable tough guy though the audience I watched it with laughed towards the end when his character takes on almostsuperhuman powers.The film offers a very brief glimpse into the world of sex traffickers but you get the sense that Neeson's character doesn't care about any of these women except his daughter. I think in the end that saves the movie  Neeson doesn't try to save the world he only wants to save one person and will do pretty much anything to achieve that.Highly recommended but don't expect any daring social commentary just sit back and enjoy while wondering why Liam Neeson has never tried his hand at any role of this sort before.".

All through the movie he gives you the impression that he is not one to be messed with and makes the action sequences look absolutely fantastic. The next Bond? Although a bit old he would fit into the role brilliantly seeing as how easily he carried it through in Taken.All in all a great movie and one I'd recommend to anyone who loves a good action thriller...

The way the script introduces you to the characters is excellent and its only when you see Liam Neeson tackling a crazed fan that you think he is an excellent choice in the lead role in fact he carries it off very well. I wasn't too sure on Holly Valance as the pop singer but as the number of scenes she is in are fairly minimal its OK. Action sequences are very well shot and you can tell Luc Besson had his hand in this. To this end the overall film has an excellent pace which keeps you very well entertained. It has the same sort of storyline as Man on Fire so if you liked that film then you will definitely like this. I would say its probably slightly better with the direction and cinematography being just a bit classier. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend you seeing this. 78 out of 10".

Apparently we're supposed to derive some kind of psychological gratification from the Freudian symbols of innocence fatherly love superhuman strength and righteousness. It actually reminds me of the fantasies I had when I was 8.Here's the plot a rich spoiled American virgin girl goes to Paris with a friend and gets abducted by Albanians and sold into sex slavery. Luckily her daddy happens to be a exCIA agent and tracks them down effortlessly kills and tortures them in a bloodcurdling fashion and gets to his daughter just before she gets her throat slit by the evil yet also stupid looking so you can still feel good about yourself toadlike sheik. On his way daddy makes a such a spectacle of killing and torturing people that it makes you wonder whether anyone would take so much trouble if no third party was watching. He doesn't even spare people who are innocent and are unlucky enough to get in his way. Like the wife of a French agent involved in the mess whom Neeson shoots in the arm because her husband refuses to give him information on StClaire. Meanwhile their kids have been tucked into bed 5 minutes ago yet they don't seem to wake up. Yep totally.All the circumstances are miraculously in Neeson's favor. His daughter is talking to him on the phone when she gets abducted. otherwise how would he know? Most victims of sex slavery are poor East European girls who don't have cellphones which would be too boring. Also she's standing in the bathroom from where she can see her friend being abducted first so daddy has enough time to instruct her how to hide and to shout out the details of their complexion while being dragged away at which she miraculously succeeds despite her panic and the struggle she puts up.Also multiple men can apparently easily get into a hotel room and abduct two girls but Neeson has to use Spiderman skills to get inside. Well thank God the bas relief of the wall was adjusted to his height exactly otherwise the movie would have ended there.Another point that disturbed me very much is Neeson indifference to the scores of other girls who have been drugged and raped by Albanians. Apparently the PRINCIPLE of sex slavery doesn't concern him just the fact that it happens to HIS daughter.In the end Neeson returns with his daughter to America with only a broken arm after fighting hundreds of heavilyarmed men. Also he has no trouble leaving France after killing each and every one of them. France must be a Third World country. Everyone is happy and his exwife has to admit he's not such a loser after all. Every Freudian fascination has been satisfied trice over.This movie does absolutely no justice to Eastern Europeans all Albanians are shown as stupid scum and we're supposed to gloat seeing them being electrocuted and above all the REAL victims of modern sex slavery. I could write a lot more about this piece of garbage but I think I've made my point now. Thank you for your attention.".

When I saw the trailer for the movie Taken I thought Oh great another 'surprising and suspenseful' thriller that will I'm sure be the ending we never saw coming after all I've seen way too many of those movies. But after so many positive reviews of this movie I decided to go ahead and give it a fair shot. I adore Liam Neeson but when I heard the role that he took as a deadly agent that you don't wanna mess with I was in question. I tell you this movie took me by complete and total surprise this was a great movie. The story is something that we've seen a million times before but what made this movie more special then the others are the fantastic performances and script that made this into an exciting and intense thriller.Bryan Mills is a retired CIA operative from their elite Special Activities Division. He describes his former job as being a preventer but has recently retired in Los Angeles solely in order to be close to his 17yearold daughter Kim who now lives with his exwife Lenore and her new wealthy husband Stuart. Mills discovers that Kim wants to take a holiday trip to Paris with her friend Amanda. Despite his initial concerns about the trip Mills allows her to go later discovering that their actual plan is to travel around Europe following the band U2. Arriving at the Paris airport Kim and Amanda meet a Frenchman named Peter who offers to share a taxi with them to their apartment. When they arrive Amanda reveals to Peter that she and Kim are unsupervised because her family is in Spain. Peter invites the two girls to a party Kim is reluctant but Amanda who is sexually attracted to Peter hastily agrees. In the house Kim receives a phone call from her father which she answers in the bathroom. From the bathroom window she sees men entering the main room and abducting Amanda. Mills is able to gain critical information about the kidnappers in the final moments after Kim is kidnapped by telling her to shout out everything about them that she notices. Briefly Mills talks to one of the kidnappers warning him that unless Kim is released he will pursue him and kill him.Seriously I'm so glad that I was wrong about this movie I couldn't tell you how many times I had my hands over my face or cheered or screamed during this movie it was so exciting. Liam Neeson I couldn't believe how scary he was I've seen him in tough guy roles before but just the delivery of the line I will find you and kill you was delivered so perfectly just calm cold and confident. I just loved how the bad guy said good luck yeah he wasn't as confident when Liam popped up in to get his revenge. Another thing about this movie that I absolutely loved is that it wasn't one of those big twist endings that are so stupid and predictable this was just one of those in the wrong place at the wrong time situations. I highly recommend Taken if you get the chance to see it it's exciting and a great movie. Liam is one dude you do not want to mess with.810".

	schema:reviewBody "To save you the time in either watching this film or reading my critique of it here is a brief summary This film is the worst film I have ever seen. This film is atrocious. This film is so unbelievably awful that all the writers directors producers and cast that worked on it should be sent to the Hague and tried for crimes against humanity.In the first chapter of this film three facts are established1. There exists a man. He's pretty tough. 2. He loves his daughter very much. 3. Aforementioned daughter is going to Paris.In order to establish these three facts which any competent writer or director could do in about ten minutes the film takes over half an hour quite possibly the most laborious half an hour in cinematic history.As soon as the daughter reaches Paris she is of course kidnapped. Literally AS SOON. So there is a sudden escalation in pace that doesn't leave the watcher thinking WOW I didn't see that coming or Wo what a skillful escalation in pace but simply OH Jesus Christ SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD THANK GOD THAT SOMETHING FINALLY HAPPENED! This sudden plot twist of course makes the liberal mother and fat short stereotypically wealthy stepfather look villainous and the absurdlyparanoidtothedegreethatheshouldseekprofessionalhelp father who believes his daughter is safer in Los Angeles than Paris becomes the allknowing hero.And of course the CIA can detect from a tiny and poorquality voice sample the hometown of any speaker. So we learn that the daughter has been kidnapped by an Albanian gang who intend to sell her into sex slavery. This is of course the point where the film ceases to be just bad and becomes outright immoral people trafficking with the intent of prostitution is a real and tangible problem in Europe and indeed all over the world if you want to see an actually worthy film that deals with the issue I suggest Eastern Promises Dirty Pretty Things or Spare Parts. Making it the subject of a Hollywood action film in which the American hero overcomes all the odds to rescue his daughter is insulting to those women who have actually been in this situation. Particularly appalling is the scant disregard that our hero shows for the wellbeing of any of the other women. It left me questioning is it supposed to be ironic? morally ambiguous? No it's just a film that chose a very sensitive and inappropriate subject for a formulaproduced action movie.As the film continues we are given more and more ridiculous scenes that insult our intelligence. One particularly stupid oversight comes when the hero walks into a brothel posing as a Parisian police officer and the villains show absolutely no suspicion of his being impostor despite the fact that he talks exclusively in English.And the most ridiculously appalling scene comes at the very end. The girl is safe as she returns from Paris to Los Angeles. Finally back in America where everyone's safe! In spite of murdering and torturing so many people and shooting the wife of a leading Parisian police officer our hero steps off the plane with absolutely no problems. Despite her best friend's death and a terrible ordeal the girl is happy and shows no signs of trauma whatsoever. And in spite of the thousands of women who suffer in sex slavery every day of their lives a plight which this film does absolutely nothing to enlighten the world on we are made to believe this is a happy ending.This film is an insult to my continent and my intelligence and a mockery of so many people who suffer in silence.But I'm European so of course I'm an evil peopletrafficker n'all...".

	schema:reviewBody "I hadn't heard much about this film but it was on TV one day and I decided to watch it. I have now seen this film about 5 times and it is one of my favourites.It is full of nonstop action shooting fighting car chases you name it this film has it. A 90 minute thrill ride. So gripping leaving you speechless at how good the action on screen is.Liam Neeson is brilliant he was born to play the role of Bryan Mills and he executed his role to perfection. Maggie Grace as his daughter was also good. The plot was fairly simple and a little bit predictable but the action was just amazing. Bryan Mills went to extreme measures to get his daughter back you just knew he would do it no matter how long it took and no matter how many risks he had to take. It was exhilarating I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.It was a short lived film but I think that made it better it just hit the spot perfectly. It was breathtaking. I could watch this film any time and it would still be great. I would highly recommend it to anyone.We're also left with one of the greatest quotes from a film  Bryan Mills I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you I will not pursue you. But if you don't I will look for you I will find you and I will kill you. to which the villain replies down the phone Good luck.  This is so memorable and really sets the film up for a thrilling ride.Overall one of the best films I have ever seen. 1010.".

	schema:headline " Of all the women we kidnap we happen to nab the one with a deadly spy as a father....just our luck...";
	schema:reviewBody "Remember that time period when Hollywood used to release incredible actionthriller movies in an orderly pace? Neither do I. What used to be a great trend to participate in back in the 90s Terminator 2 Speed FaceOff The Rock Con Air Die Hard With a Vengeance Jurassic Park The Mummy The Matrix Bad Boys Under Siege True Lies Desperado Clear and Present Danger The Hunt for Red October Patriot Games Saving Private Ryan Reservoir Dogs Pulp Fiction suddenly became a distant memory as the 2000s served very few decent Hollywood thrillers. Instead we have to head overseas to find them. The 2000s consisted of many surprisesurprise excellent European actioneers with Hot Fuzz Run Lola Run Transporter Kiss of the Dragon Unleashed and this superb flick. What happens nowadays is that Hollywood is scaling back its amount of action in order to make the extra money. In the first paragraph 15 of the 19 movies I mentioned from the 90s were ratedR. In other words they did not care about the PG13 rating. Now nearly every action movie must hit the PG13 barrier. Even the fourth Die Hard was edited to not reach ratedR which was a Die Hard staple. To add to that movies from overseas like this one become edited in the States in order to hit the weaker and friendlier PG13. But don't let that stop you. Taken is one of the most vicious PG13 movies you'll ever see and you'll enjoy every minute of its inability to cut back on the gruesomeness. It sounds barbaric I know but if you truly want to see what good action used to look like from the studios of Tinseltown look no further than this excellent effort. Luc Besson and his talented filming crew provide yet another gripping story to sink your teeth into. This time it's about a retired spy Liam Neeson who searches all of Europe in order to find his kidnapped daughter Maggie Grace. He is given a small time frame since his daughter is about to be sold into the deep disgusting and grueling underworld of sex trafficking. The movie starts off with Bryan the spy trying to adjust to a life without espionage and the rest is just a wild roller coaster ride containing plentiful action scenes and fight after fight. Written by Besson and Robert Mark Kamen Taken provides a healthy dosage of fatherdaughter sentimentality as well as provide an insight into a dangerous illegal world not seen often in movies. But it's not just the delightful taste of gunfire fights and chases that maintains the entertainment in Taken. Liam Neeson does an excellent job portraying the retired spy. While there are indeed great action stars very few of them are excellent actors as well. Liam Neeson can proudly say he fits both billings as his version of a spy is just as cold and calculating as even Daniel Craig's James Bond. Most amazing fact is that he is over 55 years of age. While Jason Bourne remains the most lethal of all the movie character spies in the last decade Bryan isn't too far behind. While everyone else in the movie delivers decent performances it's Neeson that runs and carries the show with a mix of emotion determination and rage. Pierre Morel directs this movie well by keeping the action within a decent view maintaining good pacing and also allowing for the actors to breathe out a scene when more emotion is involved. The fights themselves are brutal and not held back in the least bit. You will feel every blow you will chuckle at every clever maneuver and trick and sometimes even jump in surprise as to what's happening. The movie is quite cold as sometimes you'll forget that Bryan is the good guy especially in moments where innocent people are within the crosshairs. Like Jason Bourne in The Bourne Supremacy it's at times difficult to root for Neeson when he involves people that well.aren't really involved. But that feeling is quickly vanquished when you see him waste the next sap that is part of the sex trafficking ring. Bottom Line This movie proves multiple things Neeson can be an action star at a relatively old age Europe is suddenly a rising force in the actionthriller genre and also that you don't need fancy CGI or special effects to craft a good movie that will also lead to good money. Taken quietly emerged as the top action film of 2009 and becomes another great film with Luc Besson's stamp on it The Fifth Element Unleashed Transporter Nikita Leon. The movie has the trills and the tension but also has the heart that is sorely missing in most mainstream action films. You will cheer this movie on as it delivers with a great storyline great acting and just an overall satisfying cinematic package. Did I already mention that Liam Neeson is 57 years old?".

I had a good idea because I've always admired Balaguer Los Sin Nombre... great and I love horror films too but like I've said I had seen three horror movies before and none of them really frightened me. So I got to the cinema and waited for it to start. The atmosphere is very good it seems they worked a lot to make it but not only the atmosphere was right like in other films the story is convincing too not just killingscreamingthe end. It starts about a nurse who goes to work in a hospital in an English island. The hospital is about to be closed and the few children who are still there are supposed to be out of there soon. But it's not as easy as it seems strange things happen in that hospital one of the girls see somebody who lived and died there and that somebody hurts the kids by breaking their bones most of the times. The real interest is in what is behind that story who is that somebody and why he or she behaves like that. The acting is correct Elena Anaya Richard Roxburgh finally a good role for him! Calista Flockhart and the kids work efficiently. And most... I'd never been so frightened for a long time. I think that good stories are that which scare me. The same happened with The Changeling somehow similar somehow different. But worth seeing both of them. I recommend it.".

Flockhart is fine the kids are good Roxborugh is good Anaya is good.....just don't expect too much. The sound and cinematography are very good and Jaume Balaguer holds it all together well enough....the story ticks along and builds to the final showdown and you begin to feel some empathy and understanding of the characters but we never dwell long enough on any one character....and we don't really care how or why they are in the hospital all we want to know is well they ever leave?".

If you like a movie that knows how to build an atmosphere movies like The Shining or The Others you cant do wrong buying a ticket for this one. For me being a person who almost fell asleep during The Darkness the quality of this movie was even more of a surprise. The acting is a little over the top at times Flockhart but as a whole The Fragiles is a well acted well directed beautifully shot thriller and that little girl has eyes that just make you go aaaawww how sweet. I give this one a 8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't look don't move and don't even breathe.............Well this movie opened yesterday in Spain and I saw it and I have to say that I liked it. I have seen the directors two previous movies LOS SIN NOMBRE and DARKNESS and I think he is one of the most interesting directors in Europe at the moment. Fragile is just like Darkness in English with an international cast mainly with actors from the UK but in the lead we see the American actress Calista Flockhart and Australian actor Richard Roxburgh.The movie starts very slow but after 45 minutes it comes alive and you jump out of your seat a couple of times. The acting is not the best Calista looks mostly tired throughout the movie and there is a scene between her and Richard that should be very moving but ends up laughable. you will recognize it when you see the movie. Spanish actress Elena Anaya is hot and very talented and should have had more scenes.The best thing with this movie is the mechanical girl the ghost living on the 2nd floor. She or IT is really scary and the make up artists have done a terrific job. Every time she appears you will definitely be sacred. This movie is not going to go down as one of the best horror movies ever made but if you like movies like The sixth sense the omen the eye you will definitely enjoy this one. I hope Dimension films picks this one up for an US release cause with Calista in the lead I think the movie could gross at least 4060 million at the box office.I can't wait for the directors next movie. Viva Espaa!".

Fragile goes for atmosphere  a long sustained buildup rather than flashy effects  novelty kills some may like it's leisurely pace  get into the story  it's character's  while I thought it was reasonably watchable  modestly effective nothing impressed me that much.

At just under an hour  forty minutes it seemed longer to me again there's a lot of buildup which is competently done  acted but I must admit I just started to lose interest. The explanations behind the haunting  ghost's in general are vague  offer nothing new over what has been suggested before while I can't say I hated Fragile as it's well made  tells a reasonable story at it's own pace I never really got into it  I was never enthralled or gripped or that interested in anything that going on. An OK supernatural ghost story but far from special.Fragile is certainly stylishly made with sterile colours  good use of dimly lit hospital corridors I am sure the intention was to build the suspense  tension during the first half  then go for all out thrills  chills during the second half but again I just never got that into it or the story. There's no real gore someone's leg is impaled on a pipe  a deformed ghost is show's up but Fragile is more about atmosphere  low keys thrills than all out horror  cheap scares although the last twenty minutes does feel a little like that with a hospital crumbling around various people  a ghost showing up. Apparently edited in the US to get a lower rating the uncut version has a few swear words  a bit of gore but nothing that significantly alters the film.Filmed mainly in Spain with a Spanish crew it's surprising it was shot in English it's well made for sure but I doubt I will remember much about it in a week or two. The acting is good from a solid cast one of very few feature film appearances from TV star Flockhart while Richard Roxburgh turns up in a supporting role.Fragile is a film that requires patience  is alright if your looking for a slow moving ghost story but don't expect some sort of masterpiece as it's fairly predictable  I didn't think there was anything new here at all. Not a bad film at all but just not a great one either.".

	schema:reviewBody "Calista Flockhart of 'Ally Mcbeal' fame stars as Amy Nicholls an American nurse who transfers to an English children's hospital to help the patients in their upcoming transfer out of the nearabandoned hospital. After connecting with a particularly eccentric young girl Maggie Yasmin Murphy Amy soon discovers there's more to the hospital that meets the eye. After a series of violent  strange accidents occur Amy fights to learn the secrets that have been hidden from her by the staff.Jaume Balaguer now best known for bringing the world the modernclassic horrors 'Rec' and its sequel started out with a couple of lesserknown horror flicks including the creepy horrorthriller 'The Nameless' and the forgettable Anna Paquin vehicle 'Darkness.' Among these films Balaguer bagged former TV star Flockhart to star in this hauntedhospital horror. It goes without saying that if one wants a creepy  dangerous location for a hauntedhouse story a hospital is a great bet. There have been some fantastic hospital horrors including the muchloved 'Session 9' 2001.'Frgiles' like 'Session 9' had a lot going for it to be a very solid horror flick. It had a talented cast a very scary location and a fantastic writerdirector. And for the first 80 or so minutes of the film I thought we horror fans would have yet another great Spanish horror for the decade. It was spooky mysterious and interesting. While it did drag a bit in places it still had enough suspense to make it worth it. Then we reached the final act. After enjoying the slowburning first threequarters of the film I was ready for a very creepy conclusion. Unfortunately the film spiraled into a bit of a mess complete with a horrendously laughable spirit worse than Elizabeth Bathory in 'Stay Alive' or the Tooth Fairy in 'Darkness falls' some lame CGI effects and a fastpaced disastermovie feel. While I didn't mind what the film was trying to do with the final act the execution was much too rushed and far overthetop. It would have been much better off without it.Overall the film is interesting and creepy with enough suspense to make it worth a watch.Final Verdict 610.AP3".

The story is weak and takes enormous leaps and leaves gaps that gave me the feeling they were either in a hurry to write the script or just could n't care less.

Much of this is to do with the fine photography and design.

Truffaut's alter ego always played by the amazing JeanPierre Laud takes us through many moments of his life in the previous films while trying to correct few things in the present with his latest girl Sabine Dorothe.Here all the women of Doinel's life appears together and now he has a chance to figure out why his relationships simply doesn't work. Recently divorced of Christine Claude Jade and involved with no good terms with Sabine Doinel meets again Colette MarieFrance Pisier his first love and they share some secrets remember some moments when they two met for the first time and both characters discover more things about each other about life and about love. At the trivia section is mentioned that Truffaut thought about making a huge mistake while filming this sequel and I think he shouldn't be ashamed of it. It isn't much of a film since half of it it's flashbacks taken from all of Doinel's films plus a few moments of Le Nuit Americaine included as an interesting subplot of Doinel's romantic affairs even though he plays a different character in that film. Compared to the other movies of the series this is less comical a little bit too serious and it's more focused on how the kid that seems to never grow finally realizes what love really is than his amusing and funny life experiences as a working man. But seeing all the flashbacks those memorable moments covering 20 years of a person is breathtaking refreshing unique in all motion picture history. We can look back and see how much AntoineLaud changed through these years and some of us practically saw him growing up and I bet Truffaut must have loved this experience seeing someone he could relate with and share some of his own experiences and see them portrayed on screen. One of the most touching moments of Love on the Run is the reunion between Doinel and the lover of his mother whom he haven't seen in years and the way they talk about the past we see scenes from The 400 Blows when Doinel was a kid and saw him with his mother and he hated the guy for it then few years later they are happy to see each other a bond between Doinel's troubled life and his life while a grown up man. Most of the reviews on this classic are very superficial here. Love on the Run is a memorable delightful and magic experience through great moments of one of the most interesting inspiring and charming characters of all time and this is his goodbye to us always striving always fighting always believing in something and always managing to get what he wants even though we as audience might think he'll be lost forever. Doinel echoes a part of us that never should die our youth. 1010".

Truffaut's ode to love to JeanPierre Leaud and to Antoine Doniel does this cinematic sleight of hand with flashbacks to the other 4 movies with reintroducing a lot of the characters his exwife Collette and even the man he caught kissing his mom in the first movie and paints a more complete picture of a man who finally stops running no pun intended from his wretched childhood and who finally learns that love requires trust and sacrifice....a magnificent last chapter to one of cinema's most beloved characters.

	schema:reviewBody "Love on the Run 1979 the closing chapter in Franois Truffaut's celebrated series of films focusing on the character of Antoine Doinel a neariconic figure in French cinema brought vividly to life by the always great JeanPierre Laud. Here the actors injects the part with his usual nervous charm and cocky likability though it is clear that character of Antoine is  still as uncertain about life love and fidelity as ever before. On a Structural level the film is built around Antoine's divorce from his wife Christine  with the reappearance of Claude Jade from Stolen Kisses 1968 and Bed and Board 1970  intercut with flashbacks to early escapades from Antoine's presented in the style of a clip show.This particular stylistic device does set up a sense of familiarity for new viewers however with such a slight plot the flashbacks end up becoming the most interesting part of the movie with what little new footage there is so repetitive that it feels like you're watching the same scene over and over again. In fact the film is so hastily put together that it looks like Truffaut is desperate to get the series finished and out of the way so that he can finally move on with the more progressive work that he was attempting with films like The Green Room 1979 and The Last Metro 1980.Still the film can sometimes be charming and the actors are all on fine form but the whole thing seems lacking somewhat with the use of repeated imagery and scenes cut and pasted from the previous films making this feel too much like a retread rather than a radical reinterpretation. For me the film just seems empty deflated and somehow lacking the allure beauty and sophistication that was always synonymous with Truffaut's work or at least the films of his that I am familiar with. For me Love on the Run was something of a slight disappointing and unimaginative film that failed to inspire me in the way I had initially hoped.".

	schema:reviewBody "By finding an opportunity to firmly end his cycle of films about Antoine Doinel Francois Truffaut gave himself a great advantage by permitting this film to go to any lengths necessary as long as it concludes the series which has essentially been represented as a number of chapters portraying the lives of one unusual Parisian man.In The 400 Blows Antoine struggled with finding his place in the world as an adolescent and the relationship with his parents. In Antoine and Colette he found the pitfalls associated with love a trend that would continue in Stolen Kisses and Bed and Board. Love on the Run is brilliantly done in the way that it incorporates all of these details via flashbacks and sequences designed to remind the audience of characters seen in previous films. Truffaut carefully edits these scenes in such a way as to appear as nostalgic memories as well as to aid along the audience in understanding the reasons and consequences of these characters' actions.Once again this story focuses mainly on Antoine's ability or inability to have a relationship with a woman only for nearly everything to go wrong. Truffaut wisely brought back the two most important women to Antoine his wife of 5 years Christine and his first great love from his teen years Colette. Scenes between the two women are particularly welldone as we get a glimpse into some real soulsearching for this complex character. Antoine also has a new woman in his life the charming and bubbly Sabine who plays a most important role in this story that also manages to include subplots involving Antoine's relationship to his parents and a bit of detective work reminiscent of that beautiful film Stolen Kisses. Clearly this entire series is one of the best in cinema history. By focusing on one man and all the adventures and problems he must face Truffaut has created some of the most realistic and indelible fictional characters in all of art. In some ways these people are more real than the ones we know for they combine knowledge understanding and wisdom learned in the past as well as hope and courage for the future. All great things must come to an end and this ending is as perfect as films get funny poignant and so warm and tender. To understand why Truffaut was such a special artist look no further than these five chapters depicting the life of Antoine Doinel.".

He has a great time falling in love but soon strays or otherwise causes the relationships to sour.The plot and emotional growth of the character is excellent. So why only a 7 for this film? Well much of the film is simply cut and pasted from the previous Antoine Doinel films. This gave it a certain cheap look. Plus what I really found inexplicable was that Truffaut used clips from JeanPierre Laud films that were NOT about Doinel but pretended the clips were about him. In addition clips from some Doinel films were shown but the entire scene is redubbed or explained in a way in which the scene did NOT appear in the original film. A good example is a clip from Stolen Kisses. The narrator says he Doinel was unlucky in love and followed attractive women because he'd become infatuated with them. However this scene was actually of Doinel following a lady because he was a private detective in this filmthis was NOT someone he was infatuated with. Those who remember this movie well will be shocked at how easy it is to spot this obvious change. Finally for some odd reason one of the clips from Stolen Kisses is shown in black and white while all the others from the movie are in color. It just didn't make sense why this occurred.These inconsistencies are not great filmmaking. Decent filmmaking maybe. For a better Truffaut film try watching The Bride Wore Black my personal favorite or Wild Child or The Story of Adele H.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seeking a surefire money maker after a commercial failure Francois Truffaut reunited with his mascot Antoine Doinel to help him move past some of the recent negativity he had experienced in his career.Banking on a fast shoot only a 28day filming schedule Francois Truffaut imagined that a final collaboration with JeanPierre Laud as his character Antoine Doinel would perfectly illustrate the mosaic of life. Truffaut went into Love on the Run needing to make money for his production company after suffering a financial loss with his much later appreciated masterpiece The Green Room. There were a number of other projects dear to Truffaut's heart that he had wanted to pursue at the time but as a means to save his company he put his energy into a previously unplanned Antoine Doinel finale. Truffaut was never happy with the script of Love on the Run hating it from its earliest conception. Despite his attempts to pivot his energy he was not happy with being in the situation feeling forced to take the project on. Love on the Run was a commercial success but Truffaut was never happy with it. Still Truffaut was emotionally connected to Antoine Doinel and saddened to say goodbye to the character that launched his career.After five years of separation and reconciliation Antoine JeanPierre Laud and Christine Claude Jade have finally decided to divorce. They have reached the decision amicably and are committed to maintaining a healthy relationship postdivorce. Upon leaving the courtroom Antoine is seen by his former flame Colette MarieFrance Pisier who now works as a lawyer. Intrigued by her chance glance at Antoine Colette picks up a copy of his autobiography interested to see what has become of the young man that so desperately chased her heart years before. Antoine has been having a casual relationship with a record store clerk Sabine Barnerias Dorothe contemplating whether or not to become more serious in his intentions with her. Sabine deeply in love and committed to Antoine was put off by his neutral stance in their relationship and informs him that she may be interested in dating other people. Never one to appreciate being backed into a corner Antoine leaves Sabine's in an unhappy hurry to pick up his son. While taking Alphonse to the train station to send him off for the summer Antoine sees Colette and jumps onto the platform eager to be reunited with her. The two have a nice time reminiscing about their adolescent love and telling each other about the relationships they have had since they last saw each other. Finding himself in another dilemma in love Antoine must decide between pursuing a relationship with one of the women or remaining alone and focusing on career and fatherhood.The Adventures of Antoine Doinel the fivefilm collection depicting a version of Truffaut was written by him and inspired by events in his life making them a personal and deeply affecting anthology. Truffaut's willingness to inject so much of himself into each of his films but especially those in the Antoine Doinel series make them endlessly thoughtprovoking. Driven by Truffaut and his life the films communicate so well with audiences in no small part thanks to the expert casting of JeanPierre Laud. His playful yet searching disposition lent itself well to the perpetually unsatisfied Antoine Doinel. The part of Antoine needed to be brought to life by someone who could embody a boyish charm with immeasurable charisma and Truffaut found exactly that combination in JeanPierre Laud. Along with the exceptional casting Truffaut's particular film style created an engaging an extraordinarily fun time with the character closest to his heart. Love on the Run is filled with flashbacks reminding the audience of Antoine's progression and highlighting the ups and downs with the loves of his life. The intercutting of Truffaut's previous films in the series was a brilliant device to use for an anthology wherein many years passed between one film and the next. Many have criticised Love on the Run due to its reliance on flashbacks but I can't imagine a better way to understand Antoine's growth and development as a person. Seeing the scenes from his troubled relationship with love and his searching for a family and acceptance allows the audience to best understand Antoine as a person. I suppose ones ultimate opinion on Love on the Run will likely depend on how you feel about the number of flashbacks used in the film for me they work perfectly and Truffaut works them in perfectly. Not a single scene feels out of place or unnecessary again proving Truffaut's exceptional intuition as a filmmaker. Even in 1979 long after Truffaut was first accused of abandoning the movement he ushered in and giving up on doing anything different within the medium of cinema he affirmed he was not done taking chances. His confidence boosted by talking to Colette Antoine shares with her the premise of his next book a novel that was inspired by an episode he witnessed while waiting outside of a phone booth. The scene takes place with Antoine and Colette on the train and shows him reminiscing about the incident he saw wherein an angry man ripped apart a photo while yelling at someone on the phone. As Antoine tells the story the version of himself in the flashback suddenly becomes cognizant that he is in a flashback and he addresses the camera by brilliantly breaking the fourth wall. The scene is playful in line with Antoine's character and done in an experimental way to engage the audience and show that Truffaut had not strayed from his early intentions in filmmaking. That phone booth scene is such a perfectly quirky scene it is my favorite in an already stellar feature.Forever the humanist Francois Truffaut beautifully explored love and what it's like to finally accept the end of oncenurtured devotion. Complicated mixed feelings emerge anytime people go through a divorce especially when they have put so many years into a hopeful reconciliation. Antoine and Christine share a child together and the memories of their life together before their son were born and their elation at bringing him into the world plays into their emotional state as well. Truffaut takes us using flashbacks through the depths of their most committed love the pain and heartbreak of betrayal and their eventual decision to leave each other. Just as in Ingmar Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage Antoine and Christine can't stay hateful or bitter to the other despite the unfaithfulness that took place. It is clear that the couple has a genuine love for each other that will not be distinguished by divorce. They have a palpable affection and will always be invested in the best interest of the other. In addition to his humanism another aspect of Francois Truffaut's filmmaking that I appreciate are the autobiographical elements in each of his films. There is a moment where Antoine confesses that many don't think of him as a true writer because he has only written about experiences from his own life. He goes on to admit that he has faced criticism that suggests he is only capable of drawing from personal experiences in a transparent and conscious way. This seems to be Truffaut addressing those that had attacked him in a similar way for the personal elements found in his own art. Much to the contrary however those that so freely open the personal wounds from their own life to the criticisms of the masses are connected to their art in a much deeper way because it is in the truest sense a part of them. Truffaut's commitment to the cinema cannot be questioned and his personal approach in developing a relationship with filmmaking only gives his films a deeper resonance. It's impossible to tire of the individual films provided by Francois Truffaut I only regret that there are not more to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "The finest parts of Love on the Run are the inserted clips of the original Antoine Doinel film Les Quatre Cent Coups rather selfdefeating in a way as they only serve to show up the shallowness of the film we are watching. Truffaut's decision to follow Les Quatre Cent Coups with a series of four sequels was one of the most misguided by a great director as they are undoubtedly his weakest works.  They are supposedly semiautobiographical with Antoine Doinel Truffaut's alter ego.  He obviously had a great affection for the young JeanPierre Leaud's portrayal of the boy Antoine in what remains one of cinema's finest depictions of the precariousness of growing up so one can understand Truffaut's reluctance to leave it at that. The unfortunate thing about the films that follow is that with each one the actor through no fault of his own simply the process of growing up into a not particularly attractive looking young adult becomes increasingly more charmless.  That he still had a little by the time he appeared in Bed and Board the fourth of the series we are reminded of in a delightful clip of a scene where he plays a trick on his wife by reading a newspaper item where one word change alters the meaning from the respectable to the salacious. But unfortunately by the time we reach Love on the Run some eight years later Leaud had lost it.  Nor is he aided by material that has become increasingly more trite.  Bill Forsythe made exactly the same mistake with Gregory's Second Girl but sadder here to see a much greater director falling into the trap.  At least we can be thankful that we have been spared sequels to Bicycle Thieves The Fallen Idol and Fanny and Alexander so that our memories of those wonderful studies of childhood can remain untarnished.".

Truffaut's decision to follow Les Quatre Cent Coups with a series of four sequels was one of the most misguided by a great director as they are undoubtedly his weakest works.  They are supposedly semiautobiographical with Antoine Doinel Truffaut's alter ego.  He obviously had a great affection for the young JeanPierre Leaud's portrayal of the boy Antoine in what remains one of cinema's finest depictions of the precariousness of growing up so one can understand Truffaut's reluctance to leave it at that. The unfortunate thing about the films that follow is that with each one the actor through no fault of his own simply the process of growing up into a not particularly attractive looking young adult becomes increasingly more charmless.  That he still had a little by the time he appeared in Bed and Board the fourth of the series we are reminded of in a delightful clip of a scene where he plays a trick on his wife by reading a newspaper item where one word change alters the meaning from the respectable to the salacious. But unfortunately by the time we reach Love on the Run some eight years later Leaud had lost it.  Nor is he aided by material that has become increasingly more trite.  Bill Forsythe made exactly the same mistake with Gregory's Second Girl but sadder here to see a much greater director falling into the trap.  At least we can be thankful that we have been spared sequels to Bicycle Thieves The Fallen Idol and Fanny and Alexander so that our memories of those wonderful studies of childhood can remain untarnished.";

She was awful supposedly very mean to children but her show was devoted to them weird uh? and a lesbian. But let's go back to Truffaut's movie I am a big fan of JeanPierre Laud and in this movie his character Antoine Doisnel is still the same selfish ridiculously precious little dandy. But I still love him ! It is very funny that in the end he goes back to something that looked a lot to me like a sub La Maman et la Putain from Eustache. Torn apart between several lost loves and one that is young and not tragic... What will Antoine do? Flee as usual? You will have to see the movie I guess ! At least for Souchon's cool interpretation of the song he composed for the movie. What a smart guy ! Now he can sell tons of records.".

	schema:reviewBody "The final installment in the Antoineseries it said on the video box. I wondered if it would be such a good idea to rent the last part first the first wasn't there and then I decided there was only one way to find out. L'amour en fuite promises to be one of the worst films ever when you begin watching it. It looks like boring talky French cinema a loudmouthed movie with nothing to say. The movie isn't helped by the appearance of Dorothe the French equivalent to Barney both are pink and annoying. After five minutes her character goes her own way and we only meet her again after quite a while. By that time Dorothe remembered it might not be such a bad idea after all to act when you're in a movie. Those attempts make her character more bearable and save the movie from eternal doom.So let's all be grateful L'amour en fuite doesn't follow Sabine Dorothe but Antoine played by JeanPierre Laud. Though most people think of the bulky mass formerly known as Grard Depardieu when they think of a French actor I'd think of Laud. Either he's in 500 movies or I've just seen a lot of them. In L'amour en fuite we follow Antoine when he and his wife divorce when his latest girlfriend can't stand him anymore when he meets the lover of his dead mother and when he meets his first love again. Though all this might get the impression L'amour en fuite is a typically French talky movie about l'amour it isn't all because of the talent of director Franois Truffaut. Truffaut's efforts make this movie go from dreadful over bearable to interesting. Especially the scene where Antoine's exwife Claude Jade meets his first love MarieFrance Pisier and they talk about our protagonist shows you how talented Truffaut was. The movie can stand on its own so it doesn't matter if you haven't seen the previous Antoine episodes. L'amour en fuite is nice but nothing more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thailand's answer to Final Destination sees a group of high schoolers being picked off in gruesome fashion after learning of a supernatural phone number that can grant your most unattainable wishes. And while everyone who calls gets their Ferraris dream jobs scholarships and such the unfortunate or foolish depending on your point of view youngsters soon realise that they're expected to provide something rather important in return their lives.It all sounds very corny and cliched but 9999999 is actually very enjoyable teen horror from start to finish. Plotting is solid  leaving no room for holes or discrepencies  acting from all the cast is top drawer and light relief is given in the form of many hilarious oneliners  scenarios. Direction owes a great deal to the fast paced 'MTV style' so common in recent US movies but for once this is actually a good thing  9999999's a fun hip movie and it's not ashamed of it.It's very bloody and gory  which surprised me a little to be honest  but some of the effects anyone who's seen the airlock scene will know what I'm talking about are poorly rendered CGI which removes any repulsion factor. One scene that can cause a quiver would be where one of the boys slices his stomach on a window ledge catching his intestine and then proceeds to fall to the ground with his intestines being removed as he goes. Not something to watch with the family you see.9999999 is actually the first Thai movie I've ever seen  despite being a huge fan of the Japanese and Korean genres  and if this is a typical example of Thai cinema I can see some trips to Bangkok in my near future.

	onyx:emotionText "Thailand's answer to Final Destination sees a group of high schoolers being picked off in gruesome fashion after learning of a supernatural phone number that can grant your most unattainable wishes. And while everyone who calls gets their Ferraris dream jobs scholarships and such the unfortunate or foolish depending on your point of view youngsters soon realise that they're expected to provide something rather important in return their lives.It all sounds very corny and cliched but 9999999 is actually very enjoyable teen horror from start to finish. Plotting is solid  leaving no room for holes or discrepencies  acting from all the cast is top drawer and light relief is given in the form of many hilarious oneliners  scenarios. Direction owes a great deal to the fast paced 'MTV style' so common in recent US movies but for once this is actually a good thing  9999999's a fun hip movie and it's not ashamed of it.It's very bloody and gory  which surprised me a little to be honest  but some of the effects anyone who's seen the airlock scene will know what I'm talking about are poorly rendered CGI which removes any repulsion factor. One scene that can cause a quiver would be where one of the boys slices his stomach on a window ledge catching his intestine and then proceeds to fall to the ground with his intestines being removed as he goes. Not something to watch with the family you see.9999999 is actually the first Thai movie I've ever seen  despite being a huge fan of the Japanese and Korean genres  and if this is a typical example of Thai cinema I can see some trips to Bangkok in my near future. It has more in common with US horror than Asian but all fans of Final Destination should enjoy. Recommended.   ";

Name one porn movie with fantastic helicopter shots of Antarctica's icy surface with a science lesson tossed in too. Nada.Best of all are the honest firstrate acting performances from both Brit acting veteran Kieran O'Brian 24 Hour Party People as 'Matt' the very lucky older guy age 31 and 'Lisa' Margo Stilley the young American waif who gets picked up at a rock concert one night at London's Brixton Academy.In England where this film has already been released there was quite a brouhaha as firsttime movie actress Margo Stilley age 21 supposedly tried to have her name removed from the credits. Luckily the scathing reviews by the British press have worn off and the film is being released in the USA with Margo credited and NO NC17 rating.Although a firsttime principle actress Margo's performance is noteworthy in that her improvised dialogue not only rings true but it speaks to the neuroses of many young 'wild' females way beyond the Paris Hilton experience. She even creates a little comic relief when confronting her 'boyness' in the bathroom mirror.In retrospect I don't think this film has the artistic merit of last year's ode to eroticism Bertolucci's The Dreamers but director Michael Winterbottom does make a compelling argument for taking sex scenes to their natural conclusion. Adult audiences are gravitating more and more to NC17 rated movies re The Brown Bunny etc. and it may be time for local cinemas and Hollywood to grow up. Hey if Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt really are lovers then why couldn't they have 'condom sex' on screen for a change and how much more of an impact would that have on collegeage adults practicing 'unsafe' sex than thousands of hours of PSA's and sexed classes! Even if sex on the big screen isn't your thing this film is so pure in its intentions it's practically a 'date movie' except blind dates. Even the ladies will enjoy the sensitive approach to the material as the sexual exploits build from cunnilingus to some mild SM eventually progressing to the de rigeur 'cum shot'. As I said it's an ADULTS ONLY experience but one that might rekindle the sexual romance in your own relationships and give you a forum to converse with your partner about a sensitive subject in America anyway.".

From that somewhat minimalist expectations' level viewpoint Nine Songs did the trick. I can see Michael Winterbottom's point. Why can a writer engage in sexual imagery with no restrictions and a film author can't do the same? There is also I think a honest experimental tone in all that. Something like Let's see if it works to ask the actors to go all the way. Let's see if we can stay inside serious film making and not add an item to the increasingly inflated porn film list. I think MW managed to sail through. Yes it can be done but at what a price for the actors it remains to be seen yes it's definitely miles away from porn. As to if this incursion into real sex in the picture is as effective as explicit sex in literature I'm afraid that MW is no Houellebecq. Sex in the daring novels of Houllebecq retain a kind of legitimacy because in the center of the plot there is a couple where love between the two is expressing itself although fed by some rather nonconventional sexual behavior. Sex in Sade or in other libertine writers was deliberately tabubreaking and liberating in a way. The extremely good quality of the writing both in Houellebecq and Sade is a crucial element in allowing the authors who engage in such edgy fields to get away with it. In Nine Songs the couple fails to touch us there is no love there not even the good chemistry of sexual love and the writing in film terms is not that impressive. It resembles more a documentary which in fact it is How to introduce explicit live sex in mainstream cinema. We end up leaving the screening room with the frustrating sense that an opportunity was lost.

	schema:reviewBody "I came to this Michael Winterbottom film from one of his previous efforts starring Samantha Morton and Tim Robbins. I had never heard of him as a director and when Sight and Sound the house magazine of the BFI did an article on him I thought he was worthy of attention.Another reason for seeing this film was the promise of being able to watch a couple having actual sex and no merely faked orgasms and suggested oral sex either and no pornography. I quite wanted to be reminded of the reasons why two people can get together because of what they have in common.Winterbottom's film is not pornography at all. It is merely a study of a relationship seen through the context of real sex what nearly all of us have experienced once we are a certain age 18 usually and are not bound by religious considerations ie the Catholic priesthood and popular music. That's all. And the cast are two everyday folk. They are not artificially enhanced porn actors or glossed up dolls for the benefit of the viewer. It is a very much warts and all film although I have much admiration for Winterbottom to persuade any actor to show the camera and thus the audience his real erection and later orgasm.Once the novelty of watching real adult sex wears off however there is little else left and that's the real disappointment of this film.

	onyx:emotionText "I came to this Michael Winterbottom film from one of his previous efforts starring Samantha Morton and Tim Robbins. I had never heard of him as a director and when Sight and Sound the house magazine of the BFI did an article on him I thought he was worthy of attention.Another reason for seeing this film was the promise of being able to watch a couple having actual sex and no merely faked orgasms and suggested oral sex either and no pornography. I quite wanted to be reminded of the reasons why two people can get together because of what they have in common.Winterbottom's film is not pornography at all. It is merely a study of a relationship seen through the context of real sex what nearly all of us have experienced once we are a certain age 18 usually and are not bound by religious considerations ie the Catholic priesthood and popular music. That's all. And the cast are two everyday folk. They are not artificially enhanced porn actors or glossed up dolls for the benefit of the viewer. It is a very much warts and all film although I have much admiration for Winterbottom to persuade any actor to show the camera and thus the audience his real erection and later orgasm.Once the novelty of watching real adult sex wears off however there is little else left and that's the real disappointment of this film. Nevertheless it is an adult movie and some may enjoy it.";

	schema:reviewBody "The fuss in the media and by word of mouth led me to want to see this film. I have always had a deep interest in censorship be it of film music art or any freedom of expression.I approached this film with the hope that it had been passed by the censors because it had some kind of beautiful message or story to tell. That the overall worth of the film had outweighed the controversy of the sexual content and it was such a well made film that to deny it a release would have been an injustice to film making.But I was deeply disappointed. If you take away the explicit content of the film it has nothing. It says nothing. It goes nowhere.It has no particular storyline or insight to offer the sex scenes are all it has to carry it. Without that it becomes nothing but a collection of badly filmed concert footage. As for the musical artists chosen they are like the film..for twentysomethings who think they are being daring and are pushing the boundaries but are walking the safest path right down the middle of the road.The characters are not developed at all and what you do see and learn of them makes them instantly unlikable. Neither are they particularly attractive which makes the sexual content unpleasant to watch. It may be slightly graphic but those people watching only for the hope of a sexual thrill will also be very disappointed. I would much rather have seen this film without the graphic sexual content and a more satisfying storyline exploring the relationship between the couple. As it is it just lets you down in all areas. It is put forward as a unique insight into a couples love making but comes across as the cold functional sex of a one night stand. There is not the passion or the intensity of a genuine loving relationship.The film needed to be longer to give time to develop the characters or some kind of story and give the viewer something to grasp. The sixty six minutes running time leaves you thinking is that it? and wanting a refund both of the money paid for the film and the hour of your life you just wasted. It will remain notorious for its sexual content and continue to appeal to those who have not seen it. Once seen it loses any appeal.This film is most likely to end up being passed around schools by thirteen year old boys and skipped to the sex scenes or more likely the sex scenes downloaded from a peer to peer network.I suppose the whole film does have one thing an element of realism. It is like watching a very expensively filmed home video but as everyone knows other peoples lives may seem interesting at a distance but close up they are just as boring as your own.In this case dull is an understatement.Maybe that is the point..but if this film does have one it is very cleverly disguised.I really wanted to like this film. I really wanted it to be the ground breaking brave work of artistic genius that the media promised.That this was the film that would open the gates for a more honest era of censorship.It isn't any of those things the most interesting thing about it is the question of how it was given a certificate..the biggest question is why bother making it in the first place?".

	schema:reviewBody "It seems strange to have such an affection for a film that is so flawed and fails in so many areas. Either way I really really enjoyed Nine Songs a relationship drama told strictly through sex. First we'll list the failures. The acting of our female lead is a bit suspect and makes her in the end unlikable. The photography although intimate and immediate suffers from it's DV quality and makes you wonder how beautiful this film could have been shot with the eye of perhaps... Lars Von Trier's dogma lense. Most importantly the movie relies on two ingredients that in the end prove a bit useless. We are reliving the story in memory via the male lead as he travels through Antarctica. Although it is an interesting metaphor and a captivating landscape it seems almost entirely unnecessary. We hear him say you can be clostraphobic and agoraphobic all at the same time much like the bedroom. Secondly and most important the live music is inconsequential although good. The actual image quality is low the songs play for too long the lyrics apply to the narrative not at all and the bands all flirt with one style Michael Nyman being the exception. I must say there is an outstanding version of Jacqueline by Franz Ferdinand.Now let me tell you where the film succeeds. We experience two young naive selfish personalities infatuated with one another and the idea of one another. This is expressed in the most immediate and intimate fashion SEX. We see two people in the prime of a relationship in which the most sex is had and as much as possible however possible symbolizing favors trust forgiveness revenge and all the other facets of a relationship. These scenes also succeed because of their length the total lack of music and the director's willingness to let them exist without explanation. Although these two characters are not even particularly likable or explained to us we end up feeling as if we've shared something very deep with them solely based on the extent to which we are asked to hang with them throughout the long and graphic and no holds barred sex scenes.It may seem sick but by the end as a graphic fellatio scene ends with actual ejaculation you have become so acclimatized to this topic and it being our main source of communication that there is an almost unspoken dialogue between all parties. Instead of feeling offended we feel love for the privacy of the moment for the trust and sharing that happens there. Instead of feeling aroused we feel compelled by the motives interested in the roles played and mindful of the moment shared.By asking that you step into a theater with total strangers and watch many graphic sexual encounters many unexplained and without the usual Hollywood rampup you have signed over a certain amount of control and comfort as an audiencemember which in the end offers a truly unique experience of the love story. When all is said and done Nine Songs evoked a truly unique and loving response from me in spite of the fact that as a film it fails in many areas. I would not say that many films should be made like this but I would say that it is flirting with a new form of love story that is raw beautiful and in the end no matter how many times it fails honest by the sheer default of it's topic.".

The sex is explicit as real sex tends to be and as usual whenever any one appears on film as they do in their own bedroom there are a lot of naysayers who can't get past the nudity to see the beauty of the film.If you read a bad review of this movie it was probably written by a blue nosed censor who doesn't get much if any sex themselves and hates to see anyone else enjoying it.The couple in this movie are most assuredly enjoying their sexual relationship the chemistry between them is great to see and the concert footage in between is a nice punctuation to the movie with well known contemporary bands doing live music.The best part about this movie for me was the reality of the relationship. Several reviewers apparently have not had enough relationships that they recognize this. Why did the couple get together? Because they were attracted to each other why else? Why did they split up? Because the American girl was going home and the gravity of the relationship wasn't enough to hold her. These things happen in real life all the time so why not depict them on film? Everything doesn't have to have a detailed explanation.I thought this movie was an excellent depiction of the sort of short term relationship people tend to get into not leading to a long term commitment but forming the kind of memories that you look back on fondly years later.".

The film feels fragmentary as the scenes tend to repeat without much of a contextual base perhaps these scenes are intended to represent the lead characters' memories implying that we only remember those things that were most important to us from a relationship. The actors are game in their roles although Ms. Stilley  who has the longlimbed smallchested appearance of a runway model  comes off a bit weaker next to Mr. O'Brien indeed this appears to be her first film. I give both actors a lot of credit for baring themselves so unabashedly to the material but am a bit disappointed that even though Ms. Stilley has supposedly been offered another role in Mr. Winterbottom's next film she is said to be distancing herself from this picture apparently especially after her mother in North Carolina was alerted to its graphic nature.".

Boring.On a plus note for Winterbottom this film has has NO redeeming features A dreadful script if there was one terrible sound quality especially for a film called '9 Songs' and as for the acting it cannot really be judged considering that the sex scenes were so explicit that there was 'no acting required'. The film looks as though it was shot using a web cam and then edited on a mobile phone incoherent and flawed in every way imaginable.In short if you want to make a honest porn flick make one and I might even buy it but don't dress up live footage of rock bands with explicit sex scenes and expect us to be blinded into believing it's not a porn flick. This should have never made it to the cinema it stinks and I'm bored of talking about it.".

It is a rock concert with a Nyman interlude. Nine songs with us participating in the songs themselves participating in the going to the concerts to listen to the songs and participating in the experience that the songs are about namely obsessive sex. And also remembering or even inventing the memory of the sex drugs and rock and roll we've seen. This latter is done by our hero in Antarctica. He serves as narrator by the way.Thankfully this intense sex avoids the theatrics of Damage and works to be as genuine as possible emotionally. Is it a good movie? Could it change your life? Will it change cinema forever?Probably yes.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

It's most intriguing if you sort of switch yourself off and take the role as one of the lead characters.

I had heard it was explicit and I was curious so I burned a Netflix rental slot to see it.First off it is very lowbudget and very short. Almost all of the movie takes place either 1 in the couple's apartment or 2 in a rock band venue. I suppose the title refers to 9 different bands so nine different songs but I am not certain.Kieran O'Brien is Matt a British fellow whose job takes him to Antarctica. We see a few cutaways flying over ice or sawing core ice samples. While it is never spelled out Matt must work there in some type of scientific endeavor.Margo Stilley was 21 playing Lisa a 21yearold American in London for the summer. She hooks up with Matt and most of the story is about their being lovers.These two really enjoy sex and the movie rarely shows them doing anything else except maybe getting excited before sex or cleaning up after sex. And the sex is explicit we don't have to imagine what they are doing. Even the scenes where Lisa is satisfying herself with a vibrator are not simulated.So what is the reason this movie was made? I don't really believe it was made to be a porn movie. It appears to show a rolereversal. Most often when a man and a woman hook up for sex it is the man who says Bye time to go and then leaves. Here it is Lisa when the summer comes to an end it is time for her to go back to America. She had fun but she doesn't love Matt in the sense that she wants to build a lasting relationship with him.What I found really interesting more than the movie itself was the 12minute interview with Margo Stilley on the DVD extras. It was interesting to hear how she approached the possibility of doing a movie that required such an explicit performance and dealing with the possibility of adverse publicity. As the movie was showing I thought she was a Brit faking an American accent but in fact she is an American.View at your own risk of disappointment.".

I will give him the credit of the doubt after all he made code49 and Jude the obscure but simply filming naked bodies badly and intersecting them with poorly recorded live music is no excuse for an art film.

I live in a part of the US Utah where many sexually repressed  therefore abused  damaged  deranged people live  where many people live who hate their own bodies  the sexual parts of their natures. I grew up in the culture here which fears  loathes sex  true honest naked human bodies. When I was growing up I hated  resented the sexual feelings I started to have. Now as a mature adult who's rejected the abusive repressive culture of his youth I am very pleased and honored that Salt Lake City is as of today 12 August 05 one of the places which is showing this film in the US. I commend the film makers for trying to portray sex the way it is  in a way far better than the fakey nonsense of Hollywood and in a better way than the fakey nonsense of the crass forms of porn. I know that porn was a term created by people who didn't like the wall paintings at Pompeii and I think that nonfakey noncoercive porn is highly useful but fakey porn which has moans and other accouterments which are fake isn't useful. I think we need more portrayals of true human sexuality. It's not all that flashy. It's not fake  restful either. It's just plain old wonderful sex. In 9 Songs one type of sex is shown  the type where the female prefers that the male leave his condom on long term. But the couple is young and 20 something young adults rightly play the field and that's good. Anyway one local repressedcultureadvocating newspaper in Salt Lake referred to this film as a type of porn. I would say that it's not any more than getting up in the morning and taking a shower or seeing yourself naked in the mirror or even your masturbating or having sex is porn. A far better term is life! Sex is part of life. To the repressed repressing people I say Get used to it! Learn to love it!".

Winterbottom's approach looks more like what real people do when cameras are not present. There's a lot to be said for that in a world where most directors would be inclined to overdirect. And the interplay between the song sequences and the sequences when the couple is alone is right. Just as the live music performances trade the polish of studio recordings for the vitality and rough edges of life so do the sex scenes offer the power of realityand its imperfectionsin the place of meticulous attention to lighting and makeup. Winterbottom has edited rather than choreographed and despite his success in carrying it off I doubt that many directors would be willing to take the risk of using that technique.".

Such an experience touches me at a deeper level if I put aside questions like What's the artists intention? or What was the cultural or political motivation for hisher work? Approaching contemporary art from a more intuitive point of view paying less attention to the analytical side of my brain and more to how a piece of art makes me feel is usually a rewarding strategy.With Nine Songs I follow a similar approach. I don't care where and why the two main characters met and why their relationship didn't last neither do I want to know about all the aspects of their personalities the movie doesn't reveal to us. The film shows us very real snapshotlike scenes of a relationship.Contrary to other reviewers I believe the character development was excellent. It was not Winterbottom's intention to create an analytical piece of work that illustrates in detail every part of its characters' psyches. What we get to see is the dynamics between two young sexually very much attracted people and as such the play is dense and convincing. It is my opinion that especially Margo Stilley achieves a very authentic performance in her portray of a girl whose emotional state sways between crazy excitement lightheartedness sadness and destructiveness. Confirmation for this unstable aspect of her personality I see in the fact that she is supposed to take one little pill a day.I would like to respond to philconcannon's statement. Quote  The two actors are unconvincing and the heavilyimprovised dialogue is utterly dismal sample conversation Those glasses look stupid I'm trying to look stupid They look ugly I'm trying to look ugly.  Well I don't know about philconcannon's experiences with relationships but I consider it likely that a couple in their early twenties doesn't constantly reflect the seriousness of life in their verbal communication. It's the kind of mundane exchange probably most of us have repeatedly experienced for example as it is the case in the movie during a long and boring drive. A similar dialog takes place later in the movie when Margo Stilley again provokes Kieran O'Brien by telling him that he looks stupid. Maybe the women is going through a PMS cycle maybe she is sad and tries to escape her inner self by getting into an argument with her boyfriend. Whatever reasons there might be for this exchange I believe that it quite well reflects the reality of their relationship and their characters and therefore the dialog adds to the authenticity of the movie.In regard to the explicit sexuality shown in this movie When was for the first time in movie history French kissing shown on screen? I'm sure that caused a minor uproar at the time considering that people were used to seeing very sterile unreal lips firmly pressed on lips kisses. Sexuality is a big part of our lives and I give Winterbottom a lot of credit for the fact that he portrayed it as what it is. He didn't try to design the actual encounters as shocking or unusual as possible. Frankly I think many of the scenes were in spite of their explicit depiction wonderful to watch and even romantic. A definite advancement compared to the high gloss fake sexuality we are presented with in Hollywood blockbusters like Basic Instinct.One last thought in response to cedric owl's comment who quotes Winterbottom saying I wanted to make a film with ing in it. Well here is a more accurate description of what Winterbottom really said I asked myself why is it not possible to show sex in cinema? What is wrong with it? Not only do people want to have sex in their own lives  it is also an openly presented subject in art. No question it is not a taboo. There is a very free depiction of sexuality in contemporary literature the newspapers are full of it and so is TV.  So why not in cinema?  Many people considered it a bad idea right from the beginning. With explicit sex it has to result in a porn movie. I asked myself Actually why? How can we avoid turning it into pornography? And the other way round How is it possible at all to tell a true love story if something as essential as sex is kept out? So we started by trying to find a frame to develop a story that is interesting but at the same time as simple as possible.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not the first documentary I have seen which sets out to demystify the porn business and show audiences the people and places behind the fantasy displayed by the products at the center of the bloatedcashcow industry. However I would say this is one of the best.I believe the mark of quality for any portrait of the adult entertainment industry which is trying to exist outside the realm of and classification as actual pornography is how unerotic it comes across to the viewer. As a heterosexual male who in no way feels above being stimulated by the sort of visuals common to modern pornography and portrayed albeit mostly with tasteful obscurity in this film I am happy to report that 9 to 5... did not stir up any sort of sensuality within me as I watched it. I liked the way the director would mostly set up the shots to avoid the hardercore facets of what he was filming but would occasionally throughout the film allow certain things to go more noticed still keeping them minimized and nonpornographic in their framing. There are things shown in this film which would never be allowed in an Rrated film and would probably even be denied the courtesy of an NC17 by the MPAA if it really came down to it but the way they are portrayed is done in just the right way to prevent ones attention from being distracted or diverted towards watching this DVD for other purposes. But do beware... this is not the type of movie you want to watch with your uptight family your child or mixed company  even though the explicit footage is not tasteless it is there so if real sex is not something you want to see in a film avoid this or watch it with someone who can handle the fastforwardbutton censorship for you.The directing editing and overall stylization of this film are very well done. I liked the portraits of the subjects. Otto and his wife and John Stagliano especially really had their souls or lack thereof shine through in these shots. I could imagine the director asking the subjects to stand there and look into the camera for an awkward minute or two but these setups greatly contributed to the personalities portrayed.This film managed to remain entertaining while avoiding titillation for a solid 2 hours. The key asset to that is how lighthanded the tone is. Nothing is played for laughs. Nothing is played for sympathy. Conversely nothing is played to try and make us think these people's lives are better than we give them credit for. Everything that is funny in this movie every opinion we might have about the subjects whether they're secretly miserable or envious or whatever we might think while watching this movie I have to believe was in no way manufactured by the filmmaker and I think that is paramount to a good documentary. We see how these people live and work  nude bodies engaged in extreme sex acts are just like computers and telephones at any other job. But throughout the duration of the movie I never felt as if anybody's opinion was being forced on me or any sort of advocacy for or against pornography was shining through. Things were very neatly presented as they are and I think whatever you take away from this movie believing the porn business ruins people's lives or believing it is just a business we need in society or whatever you might think says more about what you already thought than what you saw in this movie.I find the behindthescenes reality of the porn business fascinating and watchread just about all the material I find on the subject. The way this movie balanced rawness with tastefulness and frankness with fantasy really makes it stand out as an exemplary piece on the subject.".

My biggest complaint is the numerous long useless shots of traffic with the radio on. WTF? Who cares? According to the special features there were many hours of footage not included. So sad and annoying that time is utterly wasted with scenes of traffic. If anyone knows the director personally please smack him for this. Thank you.

	schema:reviewBody "The hardest part was watching porn actress Audrey Hollander as she's completely condescended by and subservient to her egotistical and trashy husband... I thought at first that maybe she was just less intellectual than I thought but realized later that she may be on more drugs than they were showing. She looks and acts like a shell of a person and my heart really went out to her near the end when she was feeling ill on set after using enemas for unnatural things and her so called husband who speaks for and controls her like a pimp tells her to just shake it off and have a beer because she's due for another scene shortly. Then when she does this very hard core scene and is choked greatly by a very large man she sits there with her eyes closed looking like she's about to die from receiving the worst beating ever! So so sad... When the credits roll and they recap where everyone is a year later all they have to say about Audrey is Audrey is better.... If that isn't the ultimate and purest form of abuse by one's self and the one they call husband caught on film I don't know what is. I still feel it has a double meaning where the creators also meant it to mean Audrey is better... than her controlling masochistic husband or even Audrey is better... than all of this. I dare anyone who watches porn to watch this movie and read the true stories on www.shelleylubben.com and not feel complete remorse for the emotionally and physically abused women in this industry. I am personally shocked and disgusted. What I've learned or already knew  no amount of money is worth seriously hurting yourself or others...  real love means not asking for anything in return...  if something seems off or odd it is...  we all have the power to control our own lives and obtain what we wish for...  treat others with respect and you'll get so much more back in return...P.S.  My heart goes out to all the women in this industry and especially you Audrey. If you ever read this it would do you well to really consider and digest the thoughts and lessons learned above.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some years back I watched the 'Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends'' crew visit The San Fernando Valley and The San Andreas Valley CA. by appointment to a behindthescenes of a gayporn movie set. By the end of the segment Theroux asked one of the sex performers whether he was gay or bi sexual. The answer he gave was nothing short of a second or two on the 'Ol' Sparky' 'I'm straight.' He said while getting on his 'Cannondale Mountain' and putting on a shiny blue headgear. Theroux did not say anything but the guy saw his face and said 'I make 3500 an hour that's probably more than you make in a week.' Then he rode off.The porn industry is worth a sweet twenty billion USD annual with an intricate and detailed distribution network for thousands of DVDs being made yearly that compared to how much material is being made and what is in it brings up concerns when the filmmakers go to the office made of mahogany lumber of the AVN President Paul Fishbein. He does not seem too happy about the independent 'porn pickets' being formed and sold with labels like Vivid Elegant Angel etc.The documentary introduces the main players to us in a Pop Culture manner which is nice to watch and a relief from watching complex tales being unfolded. You see a performer getting ready read rectal examination for a scene speaking straight into the camera and wincing at times we hear the gloved examiner apologize and say strange things in the back and it cuts to the same performer in a glamour pose with her name and title on the top left. Names like Sasha Grey Mark Spiegler Belladona Otto Bauer accompanied with a title like 'The Rookie' or 'The Professional 'The Legend' The Pimp' et al.The movie shows you the money the big houses previously owned by Hollywood stars the parties in those houses. It only hints at drug abuse and tells us a tale of a 70's porn starlet who was raped by a fan and decided to leave the industry and become a doctor Dr Sharon Mitchell. She runs AIM and offers all sort of treatment and advice to people in porn or those who want to join. It also shows us young women doing porn to pay off their college tuition or simply to have the time of their lives if even only for a few years.It gives us a psychological yet an objective view of the inside you get to hear some outlandish reasons for entering porn where sex and money and glamour reign but those also happen to be the entrance to a tunnel whose other end opens to nothingness.It shows the girls being forced to 'do more'. In other instances the girls are said to have not been informed of the nature of the scene anal bondage interracial but do not protest being new to the sharks and the money and all that melodrama. As a matter of fact these beautiful yet mostly tormented people know that they are isolated from society because of what they do yet they try and make their lives as close to normal as possible. The film shows some of the most gorgeous women who perform extreme sexual acts filling gas rocking their baby to sleep buying grocery getting penetrated by four wellhung African Americans as the husband or boyfriend watches with an empty and sometimes anxious look in the eyes. It's kind of like 'bring spouse to work' day.The mood is changing throughout the film with a rather desolate ending or rather endings as everyone goes their ways  they move on. The contrast is what brings surrealism to the screen. One minute you're watching a hardcore creampie scene the works where the lady is being treated like a dog and the next minute the same lady is on the phone with her mum cooking dinner and taking advice. 'The real name of the film is Extreme Violations but don't let the ladies know that yet.' Otto Bauer adult performerdirector to his crew while they snicker away. Overwhelming and uncomfortable on many levels.".

While I was really looking forward to a documentary on the adult film industry I felt this one did not measure up. In almost every case except for possibly Mark Spiegler there were no happy endings. Everyone in the business did not truly seem happy with where they were and how their life ended up. Even Belladonna who seemed to love the industry and her role in it near the end of the film relents that she just wants to give it all up and find a beach somewhere. But then who does not no matter what their profession is? Sasha Grey wants us to believe she has herself together but one has to figure her chances of becoming the next Jenna Jameson are slim to none. This film also pulls the fantasy rug out from under porn as well. Take for example the scene where Otto laments that he is covered in an abundance of lube and spunk. He explains how the spunk gets in his hair. Talk about too much information. On the plus side it was cool to see Nina Hartley and Sharon Mitchell again. Both seem to be very successful having moved on from porn.".

	schema:reviewBody "The original 9 12 weeks was a fun and sexy film that was full of life. Another 9 12 Weeks is almost the exact opposite of the first film and that's why so many fans of the first film were so unhappy with this one. This ain't 9 12 Weeks. In this one the character of John is so devastated by the loss of Elizabeth his lover from the first film that in the opening moments he places a gun to his head. It doesn't get any happier from there. A few scenes later he looks out his window and sees a once beautiful horse being turned into a dead one. That pretty much describes the state of John and of this sequel. It's a dark dirge of a movie with none of the joy of the first film and that's the whole point. We see John with sexual partners including a prostitute he tries to pretend is Elizabeth but there's zero chemistry even with the film's lead actress Angie Everhart. Elizabeth departure has left a void in John's soul and few know the dark places of a man's soul like Mickey Rourke. Just take a look at his performance in Angel Heart if you have any doubts. This time Rourke's face has become so battered from boxing that his appearance fits his character's emotional devastation perfectly and this is underscored by the film's black and blue cinematography. Rourke's John truly seems to be a man who has lost everything as he wanders from the art galleries to the dark alleys of Paris like a ghost searching for some glimpse of redemption. It's not a pretty picture and it's not supposed to be. This is film about pain loss and regret. It's a joyless purgatory of a film which works best as a canvas for Rourke's haunting performance as the devastated John. This is not 9 12 Weeks. This sequel is bleak dark and tragic. That's what I like about it.".

I even read the Mickey Rourke had wanted Lyne to stick to his guns and let the film stay faithful to the book.if you haven't read the book yet.. PICK IT up  its by far the best erotic novel I've ever read its short and to the point.. apparently it is based on a true story  so it intrigues me even more.back to my review on this sequel lets face it folks most sequels are always bad.. its hard to make a great sequel period. when I first heard that there is a sequel to this film I was in shock  I felt that they should leave the story alone. but many of us who have watched the original have often wondered what became of the two protagonist... this sequel takes us there.the biggest turn off was Angie Everhart's acting... yes she is gorgeous not as gorgeous as Kim Basinger in my opinion but looks only go so far  she was merely eye candy watching her scenes was painful.Mickey was great as the tortured John. I agree with another reviewer that the filmmakers made a wise choice to start the sequel where the original left off. I'm sure others would have liked john to move on  but that sometimes isn't reality. In theory the story was good it just wasn't executed that well.I really felt deeply sad for him and the fact that he could not be with the one woman he loved  even when confronted with gorgeous women  its just not the same chemistry as he had with liz. I like the fact that elizabeth liked the games John played without having to tell him directly  she was almost like a child  which John liked. whereas lea wanted john to play with her sooo bad  it seemed pathetic.anywho.. the acting on everhearts part made the film bad for me... overall the film wasn't that bad. I think most audiences are use to the typical films which Hollywood feeds us with this one was different. It was extremely sad and painful  a love story so intense and so amazing one in which its main protagonist has to move on with his life knowing that he will never be with the love of his life ever again.".

Another 9 12 weeks is also cheesy and trashy. It's cheesier and trashier bits actually work to the movie's advantage by adding much needed levity to a very tragic story. Some have said the filmmakers should have had Mickey Rouke's character move on after losing his great love but that would have diminished the power of their connection. He can't just move on. She's gone and he can't change that. There's no way out from his torturous pain. Mickey Rourke makes you believe it. The filmmakers were smart in building their entire film around him. He truly seems like he's been through Hell. His character begins the film in tremendous pain and ends the film in tremendous pain. There's no happy ending although I like to imagine he changed his name to Marv and moved to Sin City. Another 9 12 Weeks isn't an easy movie to enjoy. Very few love it but I do.

A man tortured by guilt is not a new plot point but it's a refreshing development for a character who was otherwise two dimensional. Thusly it's a welcomed change. Angie Everhart has an energy about her that's intoxicating. She isn't just willing to pose nude She owns her nudity. She is the playful one trying to lure Rourkes character out of his shell. Her motives remain questionable along with the fate of Elizabeth the chick from the first movie. And the culmination of her motives is simplistic without feeling dumbed down. The other two predominant characters Angie's assistant and business partner are both likable and they are suppose to be. And all four turn in performances that make them memorable.So how does it compare to the original? Another is softcore porn. It's a story about moving on from guilt or risking repeating your same mistakes. The mystery surrounding Angie's character draws you in as Rouke tries to unravel the mystery. And loads of gratuitous frontal nudity tucked in around the plot keep our attention.9 on the other hand is just a boring trudge through an unhealthy relationship where two people unrealistically expect something out of the other. Until finally it ends. Also no titties at all.So in the end. You can watch Another without seeing 9 and not miss a thing. It's softcore but with talented and under appreciated actors delivering compelling performances this is worth checking out at least once. Plus naked Angie Everhart. 'Nuff Said".

How hard is it to findmake a scarf to look like the original?  This goes to show that Love in Paris is NOT a sequel.  It is a movie that must stand on its own lest it tarnish the memory of that first and great movie that it is loosely based upon.

I went home and watched it immediately and I have to say I can see why Kim didn't want to be in this film. And Mickey Mickey Mickey he's not so fine any more he's more just very creepy and scary looking. The story didn't work and was just plain unnecessary at least I didn't buy it. I mean 10 years and John still hasn't moved on? May I just recommend therapy? Though he and Lea had pretty good chemistry it wasn't as sizzling as what John and Elizabeth had.John is in Paris he is about to come to an art show where Elizabeth's paintings are about to go on auction John buys all the paintings hoping he'll bump into her. But alas she isn't there but he notices a beautiful young woman wearing the shawl he gave Elizbeth he asks her where she got it and she says Elizabeth gave it to her and they were best friends. The young woman Lea is fascinated with the infamous John that rocked her friend's world but John is just more concerned with speaking to Elizabeth but when he gets terrible news he may just have to settle for the sexy best friend.Some scenes were just too disturbing and unrealistic to how a person would react. John became too whiny and such a pansy boy. The passion wasn't very strong and the story was just horrible. I really recommend that you stay away from this movie but please see the first 9 12 Weeks it's a great thriller don't watch this one it's just plain insulting.110".

John Gray Mickey Rourke travels to Paris to try and track down Elizabeth but after learning that she's now married he starts up a relationship with a young fashion designer Angie Everhart. I think 9 12 weeks in hell would be much more pleasant that trying to sit through this film. It has one of the worst reputations in the history of sequels and it's easy to see why. It would be like trying to make a Friday THE 13TH film but instead of violence gore and Jason you threw in singing good vibes and Barney the dinosaur. I'm really not sure what the producers were thinking but this here is perhaps the most unerotic erotic movie ever made. They clearly were just wanted to cash in on the notoriety of the first movie and I understand that. I'm fine that they were simply wanting to make money but for the life of me why would they deliver something like this? There's very little sex little nudity and there's nothing erotic that happens. The majority of the overbearing 105minute running time features the two stars just going into various clubs and getting in trouble. They flirt they talk they talk some more and then they go home to do nothing. Director Anne Goursaud might have been given an impossible task but she didn't help matters any. The pacing of the film is downright horrid the lack of style just made for an ugly mess and I'm really not sure why she decided to make everything so dark. The entire film just seems like a bad nightmare that you can't wake up from and this includes the two leads. Rourke and Everhart have zero chemistry together and Rourke appears bored out of his mind and wishing he was anywhere but in front of the camera. ANOTHER 9 12 WEEKS is a really bad movie on all levels and it's even poor when compared to much of the directtoCinemax trash that was making the rounds during this period.".

Still it was a popular movie of the 1980s and I'm sure a lot better than this absolutely pitiful attempt to ride the thenpopular wave of softcore movies clogging up cable TV in America in the mid to late 1990s.Where to begin? Nothing goes right with this film and it ends up as an amalgamation of terribleness. The script is horrible the story overlong and nonsensical. This is a mood piece so there's a lot of standing around a lot of talking about nothing a lot of leaning on walls. Director Anne Goursaud has a few similar movies in her filmography but this has to be her worst.Mickey Rourke returns from the original movie and his presence is an embarrassment. He looks weird his face altered by plastic surgery so they try to hide him in the shadows for a lot of the time. It doesn't hide the obvious. Angie Everhart gives a Clevel performance nothing more and isn't memorable at all. The film tries so hard to be erotic but there are no sensual scenes and the attempts at them are excruciatingly embarrassing. In all honesty I don't know what they were trying to do here except recapture the spirit of the original movie in some way but it doesn't work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another 9 12 Weeks has been on and off IMDb's Bottom 100 list for the last few years. It's on and off because it's near the bottom of the list and occasionally other films knock it off...though eventually it seems to find its way back. Currently it's 99and it being on the list is why I decided to watch this film. Although I have reviewed tons of art and foreign films occasionally I like to see a really really bad movieone that is so bad that it gives me a good laugh. Well I must say that Another 9 12 Weeks is terrible...but I didn't recall laughing even once. It just wasn't an enjoyable experience on any level.I am sure that many tried watching this film to see copious nudity. After all that's what made the first one famous. However despite Angie Everhart being a very very beautiful woman you never really see that much of her and so often parts of her are strategically hidden. So what you are left with is like a mild R or even PG13 rated porn filmwith a plot that seems about the quality of a porno. And I am pretty sure MOST people don't watch explicit films because of the great acting or complex plots!! The film picks up a few years after the first one. Mickey Rourke arrives in Paris and is trying to follow the trail of his old fling Elizabeth. However Kim Bassinger Elizabeth in the first film wouldn't appear in this film so you know he won't get his lady love. In the meantime he meets one of her bizarro friends Everhart and she spends most of the film jerking Mickey around and not in a good way. As for Mickey he spends all his time brooding and grunting. And ultimately you learn that Elizabeth was dead and this other woman knew this all along. Does it sound romantic? Does it sound sexy? The plot is too thin for most porn films. It rarely makes sense and is never interesting. Rourke mostly grunts and Elizabeth behaves like a women who is off her meds. But the worst part about it is that it really isn't sexy. I really have no idea what they were thinking when they made this one...but it's pretty limp double entendre intended and not worth your timeeven if you are a bad film buff.".

My biggest draw back is the miss use of Angie Everhart one of the few redheads in movies. She can play an icy fatale better than most but she is not so good as the girl looking for love although she does look good with rose petals and honey smeared on her. The original directed by Adrian Lyne is one of the better erotic fests with a more convincing lead in Kim Basinger and a smoother faced Rourke.".

Right of the bat I felt no chemistry between them. I think Angie is a good actress I just don't think she's found the best movie to show off her greatness. Everhart was the hot French fashion designer and Rourke was....the depressed kinky dude from America that seriously made me wonder why he didn't just kill himself as soon as he found out that Elizabeth was dead.....so Angie Everhart 9 Rourke 3 and the movie.....could have been better....a whole lot better".

	schema:reviewBody "Yash Chopra's murder mystery Ittefaq is certainly a rare Hindi movie experience for its time. It has absolutely no songs it doesn't have any subplots or attempts at comedy it takes place mostly in one house during one night and so it is only one hour and 45 minute long an exception for Hindi films of that time. This helps to create a consistently gripping interesting and focused picture which gives the viewer an opportunity to concentrate on the proceedings without breaks. The script is wellwritten and taut and Chopra's direction is very good. His attention to detail is quite impressive throughout although there's a slight lack of it at times and the film is enjoyably tense chilling and suspenseful.The film totally belongs to Nanda who is excellent as the ambiguous and highly appealing Rekha. Whether she is a lonely wife a terrified captive or a seductress she is throughly convincing but not less important she is so smashing hot. I don't remember any leading lady of those times looking so effortlessly sensual. She wears only one saree throughout the film which is also quite unusual and yet she looks more and more attractive and alluring with each new scene without ever being vulgar. Towards the end when the truth is uncovered her character is the one I personally ended up feeling the most for. Sadly today people hardly give this talented actress the recognition she deserves. Rajesh Khanna on the other hand is not consistently credible. He is very good at some scenes but then quite terrible at others struggling with a role that seems to be too demanding for him. The very first scenes of the film when he is accused of his wife's murder are quite an example to that as he just shouts and screams very unnaturally that he is innocent. The supporting cast however is very good. Unsurprisingly Iftekhar is the most impressive of the lot getting a role that is more lengthy and substantial than the ordinary blinkandmiss parts he used to play in other films and playing it with restraint and style. Bindu Gajanan Jagirdar Shammi Sujit Kumar among others are all very good in smaller parts.Towards the end the film does drag a bit as it starts losing its sense of uncertainty and becomes rather predictable. The final sequences are more of a courtroom drama only that they take place in this very house. The ending discloses all the secrets and resolves all the conflicts in just a few shots working a lot on convenience and being quite contrived. There are also some really cheesy dialogues which could have been avoided and this whole portion of the film feels too sugarcoated. That said I frankly didn't expect something else because I had seen several of B.R Chopra's thrillers who's the film's producer and they had the same kind of ending. Ittefaq is overall a memorable and highly watchable suspense thriller.".

First and foremost for the fact it had no songs secondly for the theme of the film thirdly for portraying a leading character in the film as a negative one fourthly it was a film totally different from what normally Rajesh Khanna or Yash Chopra used to do. Rajesh Khanna puts in an excellent acting performance in the role of a man accused of murdering his wife and on the run from the law for it. Yash Chopra director handles the film brilliantly and the viewer is kept on the edge and guessing right thru to the end. A must see for all lovers of Good Indian Cinema. Hmmm Good Indian Cinema sound like a misnomer in today's Bollywood".

Bringing back to what i was saying both the combined efforts of Yash Chopra as director and B. R. Chopra as producer made this film not just ahead of its time but ahead of what storytelling we wouldn't be seeing in our Indian Cinema for years.The film talks about how Dilip Roy Rajesh Khanna ends up in a mental asylum after the charges of murdering his wife and being mentally unstable and how he runs from the hospital and ends up at the home of Rekha's Nanda house who has her own ulterior motives to execute and needs a pawn like Dilip to make that going and how they both get into friendly relationship that runs deep down with lies betrayal and truth. And how Iftekhar as Inspector Karwe investigates for truth.Talking about the performances Rajesh Khanna acts at its best and proves that his selection was absolutely right and pure. Same goes for Nanda who does the real kind of acting without any fakery. And all other actors who make the film timeless even now in 2017 and 2018 along with Chopras.Nothing more i will say because i believe till the time you don't see the film you won't realize how great it has been made. And with remakerehash coming in 2017 i believe things are going to edgier and better because the trailer proves it.Below are links of the film and the reworked version trailer  httpsyoutu.bepwlbKQb0z0Mhttpsyoutu.bemvfvoCdPrII".

Researching the film I decided that I had to watch it. And after watching it I can say that I liked the film a lot.Plot Dilip Roy seeks shelter in Rekha's house after escaping a mental asylum. But Rekha too has secrets of her own.Story and direction The film being a remake comes as no surprise to me. But still for pulling of this kind of film requires guts. Releasing in an era where romance dominated and films had songs that were hummable is quite a challenge. But this film stood by every means. We get greatly woven characters and story. Which is what anyone wants in a film. You care for each and very character that is present on the screen. I remember being on the edge of the seat every minute. Being 105 minutes the film utilized mostly every minute. And the editing is so great. It feels like the film took place in one shot. But this film has its share of flaws. Somewhere after 40 minutes have passed the next 20 minutes have nothing much to offer. I felt bores during that time. But then the film gets a rise and again my interest for the film piqued. The background score wasn't much interesting too. It employed some strange sounds and music which was just noise to my years. Considering Salil Choudhary's calibre that wasn't expected.Performances Nanda was impressed. Her variations in her character clearly reflected in her acting. Rajesh Khanna again proved no matter what the role he can master it. Iftekhar and Bindu too provided some great support. Sujit Kumar was good too.Favorite Scene The scene where Dilip tells Rekha that we can live together in this world without any anger or hate. The way in which Rajesh Khanna said the dialogue and the setting made me attract towars this scene.Verdict Although with a few hiccups. Ittefaq is quite a decent watch. Considering the time in which it was made it is quite good. Yash Chopra still proved that why we still consider him as one of the great directors.I am going with an 8.510.".

	schema:reviewBody "While My Sassy Girl still to this day sets extremely high standards in the Korean and nonKorean romantic comedy cesspool more films go through the lab of sometimes unfair comparisons and unforgiving expectations. Oh people still enjoy them no doubt about that but the great original portrait of My Sassy Girl hangs high as a true testament of perfect mix of comedy romance and melodrama.This film is no different from all the other romantic comedies from Korea as it makes you yearn for the same feelings that you attained while and after viewing MSG. The story of course is completely different. Sangmin is a college student planning on prospering his carefree dating life and Boeun is his 16 year old childhood pal who has a crush on a boy from her school. Next is Boeun's grandfather trying his best to get them marry each other against their will. Keep the age difference in mind which in no way should be viewed as a gross endeavor but merely as a cultural difference. While this movie lacks supernatural enigmas and over the top action it easily makes up for it with great chemistry between the two leads.Geunyoung Moon's performance was especially interesting to note here after her completely different outing in A Tale Of Two Sisters. Raewon Kim is no rookie to playing such roles and he did a refreshingly good job here as well.Another fine accomplishment in this film is delivered through its length which stands at almost two hours.

	onyx:emotionText "While My Sassy Girl still to this day sets extremely high standards in the Korean and nonKorean romantic comedy cesspool more films go through the lab of sometimes unfair comparisons and unforgiving expectations. Oh people still enjoy them no doubt about that but the great original portrait of My Sassy Girl hangs high as a true testament of perfect mix of comedy romance and melodrama.This film is no different from all the other romantic comedies from Korea as it makes you yearn for the same feelings that you attained while and after viewing MSG. The story of course is completely different. Sangmin is a college student planning on prospering his carefree dating life and Boeun is his 16 year old childhood pal who has a crush on a boy from her school. Next is Boeun's grandfather trying his best to get them marry each other against their will. Keep the age difference in mind which in no way should be viewed as a gross endeavor but merely as a cultural difference. While this movie lacks supernatural enigmas and over the top action it easily makes up for it with great chemistry between the two leads.Geunyoung Moon's performance was especially interesting to note here after her completely different outing in A Tale Of Two Sisters. Raewon Kim is no rookie to playing such roles and he did a refreshingly good job here as well.Another fine accomplishment in this film is delivered through its length which stands at almost two hours. It lets the story gradually develop along with its characters making all transitions and actions feel well paced and believable.If before watching Korean romantic comedies you know each time what exactly you are getting yourself into then don't hesitate to give this movie a try.

This movie tells the story of two young people who are forced into arranged marriage because of the wish of a dying relative. It shows how the two deal with this situation that has happened against their will and has many humorous moments showing the scrapes they both get into as they try to tolerate being around each other without fighting. However this movie is not so amazing that I would want to own it or rewatch it over and over. A bit too clichd for me as well some of the characters namely Sangmin the male lead just didn't appeal to me although I found Boeun to be very cute! If you're looking for a movie that stands apart as simply fantastic in this genre I would suggest 'My Sassy Girl'. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Several reviewers took exception at this film's depiction of marriage between an adult a college student and a 15 year old high school student. I feel the subject was handled with a lot of sensitivity. Arranged marriages are still frequent in many parts of the world and deserve a movie about them. Millions of very young women still tie the knot before they are 18 in Asia or the neareast or Africa. Why should the subject be taboo? The film does not condone the practice as a matter of fact it shows how wrong it could be. The pleasure comes from watching these two young people make what they can with a situation they are not completely responsible for. Although the film is light and often funny it has its share of pathos. Many will recall the awkwardness of first relationships they are even more awkward in an arranged marriage.This movie is very likable. The two stars are fun and charming. The tone is breezy throughout but very realistic. Many of the clichs are there THe karaoke scene the dream scene the misunderstandings at school... but they are treated in such an offhand way that they don't feel calculated. For a first film Hojoon Kim's direction is assured and precise. One of the best Korean comedies I have seen lately recommended to put a smile on your face and make you think...".

Here we have Sangmin who is depicted as a carefree young man who is enjoying life as a bachelor. We then have Boeun who is a young girl who dreams of getting into college.The chemistry between the two of them is amazingly well acted out. We can see how they tease and mock each other yet very obviously beneath all the jokes and insults there is real concern for each other. The great thing about this movie is the way the relationship develops in this film. Slowly we learn just how much Sangmin cares about Boeun who is seemingly oblivious of her own feelings. The right balance of seriousness playfulness and jealousy makes the whole relationship work. It's very amusing to watch them both become jealous of each other's new interests as we are able to see how much concern they hold for each other.One of my curiosities about the film is this if they had not been forced to marry would they have ended up together anyway? I like the fact that Boeun finds the letter that Sangmin has kept all those years and the scene between her and her mother in which we are told of Sangmin's care for her when she was younger. We can see that his feelings have always been good towards her and I think deep down she has always felt this way for him. An amazing film to watch if you to relax and finish a movie with a smile on your face and new fresh outlook on love".

	schema:reviewBody "Boeun Geunyeong Muna fifteen year old school girl is sent to collect SangminRaewon Kim a university aged guy that she has known all her life from the airport. There we notice that Sangmin has somewhat of an eye for the ladies. Sangmin had been studying abroad for a year. When they reach home we discover that the Grandfather has called Sangmin back because he wants Sangmin  Boeum to marry before he dies now. During the Korean War Sangmin's  Boeum's grandfathers promised that they would become inlaws that wasn't possible with their children as they both had boys. Both parties aren't enthusiastic but Boeum's wily old grandfather manages to coerce them into marriage by pretending he was dying in hospital. The problem is neither Boeun nor Sangmin are mature enough to be married. Which is proved when Boeun ends up running away at the airport instead of going on her honeymoon.We follow Boeun  Sangmin as they settle into marriage and living together but in separate rooms while at the same time trying to keep their marriage a secret. While it is legal to get married at fifteen in Korea it isn't exactly standard practise. When Sangmin ends up becoming a teaching intern at Boeun's school he attracts the romantic attentions of a female teacher  Miss Kim. When Miss Kim discovers that he is married to Boeun she punishes Boeun by making her paint a wall for the school festival on her own. It is this or rather the help that Sangmin gives Boeun without her knowledge every night that leads her to realise that she is in love with him.I suppose if you come from somewhere like American you'll recoil screaming 15 year old girl college aged man  Statutory Rape. However both of the characters aren't American. They don't have the hard edge or the worldly wises that someone in the West would have. Take for instance Sangmin  wannabe pervert  playboy  all he does is look or talk about beautiful girls. You don't actually see him talking to them. There is a scene where he is standing with his shirt off in front of his male friends and his female a couple of years olderSupervisor comes into the room. He all but screamed and pulled a sheet up to cover himself. You've never seen a guy move so fast. It was hilarious.

	onyx:emotionText "Boeun Geunyeong Muna fifteen year old school girl is sent to collect SangminRaewon Kim a university aged guy that she has known all her life from the airport. There we notice that Sangmin has somewhat of an eye for the ladies. Sangmin had been studying abroad for a year. When they reach home we discover that the Grandfather has called Sangmin back because he wants Sangmin  Boeum to marry before he dies now. During the Korean War Sangmin's  Boeum's grandfathers promised that they would become inlaws that wasn't possible with their children as they both had boys. Both parties aren't enthusiastic but Boeum's wily old grandfather manages to coerce them into marriage by pretending he was dying in hospital. The problem is neither Boeun nor Sangmin are mature enough to be married. Which is proved when Boeun ends up running away at the airport instead of going on her honeymoon.We follow Boeun  Sangmin as they settle into marriage and living together but in separate rooms while at the same time trying to keep their marriage a secret. While it is legal to get married at fifteen in Korea it isn't exactly standard practise. When Sangmin ends up becoming a teaching intern at Boeun's school he attracts the romantic attentions of a female teacher  Miss Kim. When Miss Kim discovers that he is married to Boeun she punishes Boeun by making her paint a wall for the school festival on her own. It is this or rather the help that Sangmin gives Boeun without her knowledge every night that leads her to realise that she is in love with him.I suppose if you come from somewhere like American you'll recoil screaming 15 year old girl college aged man  Statutory Rape. However both of the characters aren't American. They don't have the hard edge or the worldly wises that someone in the West would have. Take for instance Sangmin  wannabe pervert  playboy  all he does is look or talk about beautiful girls. You don't actually see him talking to them. There is a scene where he is standing with his shirt off in front of his male friends and his female a couple of years olderSupervisor comes into the room. He all but screamed and pulled a sheet up to cover himself. You've never seen a guy move so fast. It was hilarious. You wouldn't see a guy of that age doing that in the West.This movie has a charming naivet and is very funny with well drawn out characters. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something different from the regular run of the mill Hollywood fare.";

My Little Bride is a witty charming romantic comedy fresh from South Korea I say fresh because it still manages to live up to its names more than 11 years after its release.

Kim Rae Won's acting is also highly creditable. It is a very heartwarming comedy that mix and mingles some serious themes with amusing dialogue and narrative quite well.

By the end of the movie are we supposed to feel OK about guys in their twenties being romantically involved with 15yr old school girls? In my opinion it kind of makes Korean males look bad.

	schema:reviewBody "As quoted from its websiteThe movie THREE is an omnibus of Asian mystery tales inspired by the desire of three filmmakers in three very different countries  Korea Thailand and Hong Kong  to create an exciting new movie in a proven genre which would appeal to audiences across Asia. THREE represents a true panAsian collaboration as it brings together three acclaimed directors from each country  respectively Kim Jeewoon Nonzee Nimibutr and Peter Hosun Chan  as well as three vibrant new film production companies  b.o.m film production Cinemasia and Applause Pictures.Ok with that out of the way below my take on THREEThe derivative Korean sectionMemories by Kim Jeewoonis mediocre at best. Resorting to cheap shock tactics it completely lacks that the hair raising mood provided by the likes of Dark Water or THE EYEBoth Asian Horror Hits over the past year.For the Thai sectionThe Wheel by Nonzee Nimibutr of Nang Nak fame what can I say? To put it nicely the film would have worked if it was made for an unjaded audience 1020 years ago. In short not very scaryBut for the Hong Kong Section that's another story.Directed by Peter Hosun ChanComrades almost a love story and exquisitely shot by Christopher Doyle Coming Homeits title completely blew me away.If I had a say I would have rather Coming Home been a complete movie by itself.Part Scifi part horror this idiosyncratic film is in a league of its own. In a strange concoction of morbid chills and genuine pathos Coming Home came packed with an unexpectedly heartbreaking punch. I didn't know what hit me until its searing climax. Unbelievable...Worthy mention goes to Leon Lai for his intensely leftofcenter performance. Spoilers Despite portraying an initially creepy character with perversed tendency Leon miraculously blindsided our judgement with his overwhelming conviction to his wife whose love he had for is beyond simple words. This was indeed a tour de force performance deserving of award recognition come year end. Had he not completely discarded his pop idol veneer this film might have fallen apart like its two other Asian counterparts.Having been mismarketed as a straight horror flick audiences who went into THREE were thus sorely disappointed. Coupled by the disappointments of the first two installment Coming Home may as a result be denied its rightful chance to shine. And shine it did.Coming Home dared challenge the artistic threshold of its audience. Transcending its genre origins this profoundly moving film brims with ethereal beauty stirring soul and most of all a sincere heart. I am going out on a limb here but I think Coming Home can qualifiably rank as one of the most poignant films to come out of Hong Kong cinema in recent years.At the very least when all the hoopla dies down I can take comfort that films like this remain as treasured cult classics for discerning movie lovers out there.".

	onyx:emotionText "As quoted from its websiteThe movie THREE is an omnibus of Asian mystery tales inspired by the desire of three filmmakers in three very different countries  Korea Thailand and Hong Kong  to create an exciting new movie in a proven genre which would appeal to audiences across Asia. THREE represents a true panAsian collaboration as it brings together three acclaimed directors from each country  respectively Kim Jeewoon Nonzee Nimibutr and Peter Hosun Chan  as well as three vibrant new film production companies  b.o.m film production Cinemasia and Applause Pictures.Ok with that out of the way below my take on THREEThe derivative Korean sectionMemories by Kim Jeewoonis mediocre at best. Resorting to cheap shock tactics it completely lacks that the hair raising mood provided by the likes of Dark Water or THE EYEBoth Asian Horror Hits over the past year.For the Thai sectionThe Wheel by Nonzee Nimibutr of Nang Nak fame what can I say? To put it nicely the film would have worked if it was made for an unjaded audience 1020 years ago. In short not very scaryBut for the Hong Kong Section that's another story.Directed by Peter Hosun ChanComrades almost a love story and exquisitely shot by Christopher Doyle Coming Homeits title completely blew me away.If I had a say I would have rather Coming Home been a complete movie by itself.Part Scifi part horror this idiosyncratic film is in a league of its own. In a strange concoction of morbid chills and genuine pathos Coming Home came packed with an unexpectedly heartbreaking punch. I didn't know what hit me until its searing climax. Unbelievable...Worthy mention goes to Leon Lai for his intensely leftofcenter performance. Spoilers Despite portraying an initially creepy character with perversed tendency Leon miraculously blindsided our judgement with his overwhelming conviction to his wife whose love he had for is beyond simple words. This was indeed a tour de force performance deserving of award recognition come year end. Had he not completely discarded his pop idol veneer this film might have fallen apart like its two other Asian counterparts.Having been mismarketed as a straight horror flick audiences who went into THREE were thus sorely disappointed. Coupled by the disappointments of the first two installment Coming Home may as a result be denied its rightful chance to shine. And shine it did.Coming Home dared challenge the artistic threshold of its audience. Transcending its genre origins this profoundly moving film brims with ethereal beauty stirring soul and most of all a sincere heart. I am going out on a limb here but I think Coming Home can qualifiably rank as one of the most poignant films to come out of Hong Kong cinema in recent years.At the very least when all the hoopla dies down I can take comfort that films like this remain as treasured cult classics for discerning movie lovers out there.";

	schema:reviewBody "Three is an omnibus supernatural horror film comprised of three onehour long minifeatures. Each one was produced in a different country Peter Chan representing Hong Kong Kim JiWoon representing South Corea and Nonzee Nimibtr representing Thailand.The opening film Kim JiWoon's Memories follows two individuals as they grapple with seemingly missing memories a man who's wife is missing and a woman who's trying to figure out who she is. The work actually foreshadows a lot of what will eventually show up in Kim's following feature A Tale of Two Sisters which I really liked. While the film does feature a number of eerie moments it also suffers from a lack of a strong story. There's not much to its revelation and the characters are fairly static. To its merit it's probably the most technically proficient of the three films and certainly the scariest.The second piece is Peter Chan's Going Home and this is probably the best overall of the bunch. While its production values are actually the roughest of the three the story is probably the highlight of the three. The story is divided into two segments the first where a cop and his son move into an aging complex where few people live and is seemingly haunted. The second the cop grapples with a seemingly mad homeopathic doctor who is appearing to pursue the resurrection of his dead wife. The film grasps well its theme and the story has a few interesting revelations to provide while also having something to say about the power of lovehope.It's not a scary piece for the most part but despite the production values the direction appears sure and makes great use of its setting and limitations.The final film is Nimibtr's Wheel which is about an arts troupe grappling with the curse of an evil puppet. This is probably the weakest segment. While it does have some good imagery to offer the story is confusing aimless and the scares are without method or meaning. Some of the visuals are chilling but because of the rather slapdash and sometimes illogical story the overall effect of the piece is muted.All in all I have to say that Three isn't a complete waste of time due to the solid piece by Peter Chan and the stylish opening act. On the other hand it's weakened by the third piece and while the three do try to take on the same overall concept they seem to be too divergent to really make a cohesive whole with Nimibutr's Wheel really on a different plane than the other two. Probably better viewing for genre lovers of horror or supernatural films and perhaps for more curious cinephiles but I don't see that it's going to be particularly impressive for anyone else. 610 for Memories 810 for Going Home 410 for Wheel. 610 overall.Note The US release of this film changes the order of the films around so that it opens with Memories then goes to Wheel and closes with Going Home. I'm not certain how the Hong Kong and Thai versions of the film orders the three I watched the Corean version.".

The child actor who plays Cheung is simply amazing his emotions are utterly convincing and it's easy to forget that he's acting.Unfortunately the other two pieces 'Memories' and 'Wheel' leave much to be desired.

But ultimately the hackneyed plot is yawn inducing though the scenes are shot beautifully.Finally that leaves 'Wheel' a confusing mess if there ever was one. Throughout the short I kept wondering if censorship was the reason I hadn't been scared yet.All in all most would probably be happier renting Saam Gaang.

	schema:headline " THREE EXTREMES II flounders as horror but flourishes as drama";
	schema:reviewBody "After the vast success of Three Extremes three other Asian horror savants South Korea's Kim JeWoon Thailand's Nonzee Nimibutr China's Peter Chan stepped up to the plate to deliver us a successor.The original had three tales of distinct horror methodsone of grossouts one of violence and one of psychological maiming. Three Extremes II however seems to have a common theme about all three which is the voyage of the afterlife.Due to atmospheric and thematic similarities I found the stories a little less engaging when viewed backtoback. Perhaps this could've been that the first two films of the movie the first especially were rather uneventful.Starting chronologically the short Memories by Kim JeWoon is South Korea's entry into the anthology. It starts with promise as it shows a man presumably sleeping on a couch and very gradually pans closer and closer to him. Then it shows us more of the room he is in and immediately JeWoon strikes a nerve of undeniable creepiness with a huddled women rocking to and from in a corner. This sense of uneasiness quickly dissolves as the story progresses. Nothing really happens throughout. Like I said above it was uneventfulsure people are talking though there's an odd lack of dialogue in Memories sure they're walking and driving around trying to discover a mystery but it's a mystery most viewers have probably solved. There's also a woman who seems to have lost her memory but almost immediately I put twoandtwo together and figured out her connection with our main character. JeWoon uses rather cheap shocktactics like sudden movements and sharp music to make us jump. Its unfortunate Kim JeWoon's entry was so weak narrativewise and predictable storywise because he is the director of one of my favorite movies ever A Tale of Two Sisters. I went in hoping for something exquisite from him but got a rather generic story. I do not dislike the movie because it does have its pluses like solid acting beautiful camerawork and the cutest child you'll ever see in any movie but I cannot say I liked it either because there was so little story. Allinall Kim JeWoon's Memories is forgettable shiny and predictablenothing more than you'd expect from one of Hollywood's Jhorror remakes.The middle segment on the disc is one of Thai origins called The Wheel from director Nonzee Nimibutr. Being only briefly acquainted with Thai horror I found myself excited to see what Thailand had to offer. Many reviews claim this to be the flimsiest entry but I have to disagree. I think most of The Wheel was lost in translation because it is a piece so close to Thailand. It's a cultural short involving Thai beliefs that we North American viewers simply cannot graspor at least not appreciate fully. That being said I personally loved the cultural experience of watching The Wheel and felt almost like it was a documentary of rural Thailand. The set design is beautiful and exotic the costumes and puppets are breathtaking and unique the entire piece rings with foreign flavor and was a nice contrast to Memories which could've been copied and pasted into any country's film. That being said while it dealt with horror spirits possession and vengeance it didn't feel like a fullfeldged horror. The very opening is chilling but like Memories it fades to black rather quickly. Unlike Memories I found myself interested by the foreign aspect and the beauty of the setting from the murky lagoon to the unique houses to the vibrant costumes. The acting throughout is rockythere's a few actors who deliver questionable performances and that is probably my biggest qualm with the film. Aside from that it had a very redeeming ending and in more ways than one.The closing piece is absolutely and without question my favorite of the three and probably my favorite out of the original three as well. I think the DVD editors placing Peter Chan's Going Home last was strategy as they started with the most feeble and the Going Home segment is powerful enough to make you forget about Memories's weakness and leaves you with a very positive feeling after watching. Had they reversed the order the haunting touch of Going Home wouldn't have survived through the end of Memories and my review would be two starts instead of three. That may sound ridiculous but it's all too true. The story starts with a single father and his son who are moving into a new complex one that looks decrepit and neglected. This dirty setting is awesome for capturing what will happen later. Chan's direction then switches from the fatherson relationship and to a much more aberrant relationship concerning a rather shoddy character we're introduced to through the young son and a wife who is seemingly longdead. This is a ghastly provocative touching story of requited love and the testing of lengths one will go through for that love. I will not delve any further into the storydiscover this gem on your own. If anything this DVD is worth the 15 for this piece aloneI wish it could've been a feature length film.Overall Three Extremes II doesn't succeed as horror but are an excellent trio of chilling dramas. It was a disappointing followup to Three Extremes but the two shouldn't be compared because they are different films with different messages. I picture only a fan of Asian horror liking this DVD so if you're new perhaps go with something more userfriendly before diving into this piece.6.510".

Downside the Tales from the Crypt punchline left me feeling pretty empty really. Told through two simultaneous intercut narratives one follows the hubby trying to remember what he did while the other follows the wife waking up with amnesia in a street. The hubby material is generally boring and laden with noise blast jumper moments that are OK but nothing new except the visitation from the apparent ghost of the missing wife whole feels a brain is a good thing to waste after all. Nice one. The wife's narrative as she goes through a miniMemento tracking through the clues and flashes of memory trying to figure out who and where she is kicks ass. This is well shot well edited tense and absolutely wonderful. Apparently also too good to be true because the climax of the short film is apparently a simultaneous realization by both people as to what had happened between them. Neat. Now we've managed to resolve the mystery true in the lamest way possible well not completely lame it's definitely disturbing on a visceral level which has appeal on a base level BUT now we also feel empty because the wife who by now we dig well her whole struggle and journey past the scary construction sites and insane cab driver now all of that is rendered useless and unjustified while the hubby rides off into the sunset the tail end of a Viagra commercial. Damn almost a genius piece of jumper genre fare. The Wheel is a very captivating and almost completely alien yarn that works well and moreover is generally fun to watch. Starts a bit slow and the appearance of dead loved ones could have been held off until the end and didn't get the crying blood thing but it looked cool so who cares? Ends extremely well who can frown on a machete welding preschooler? Moving on. Going Home is what I bought this anthology for without even knowing it. Oh my. Beautifully rendered in every department the location is an astoundingly effective nearly abandoned pair of adjacent dense apartment towers in the seedier side of HK where we follow a Dad and son moving in while everyone else is moving out the building is going to be demolished in a month explains the manager. We meet another couple and a little girl and we learn through brilliant art direction all kinds of things like how ghosts do graffiti how Eastern medicine cures liver cancer how to best groom and maintain a beloved wife who has taken a three year hiatus from living to get well again and most importantly how big a urine bottle needs to be to adequately provide for your well saturated hostage. I'm making light only because I'm giddy with joy over how fresh beautiful terrifying disturbing and ultimately heart touching did I say touching more like pounding with a meat cleaver and pair of well matched tuna.

Perhaps he has found his true niche in cinema? And as for the rest of the cast? Although familiar already with the power of Eric Tsang the rest of the cast was new to me and further blew me away as well astounding as two of the actors I'm referring to are tiny children not something I'm generally impressed by. And how does the beautiful Eugenia Yuan manage to hold so still playing a stiff and still manage to convey her character? something I've ironically accused Leon Lai of doing in the past ha ha.

These three directors are less bankable than Takashi Miike and Chanwook Park though Jiwoon Kim does have A Tale of Two Sisters under his belt. Plus it's much weaker. 3 Extremes in my mind is maybe the greatest horror anthology ever made so this one has a lot to live up to. It begins with Kim's Memories which has some familiar Asian ghost story elements but concentrates more on the images and moods than actual plot. In fact the plot is fairly incoherent though after having seen the whole thing it's easy enough to piece together what exactly is going on. I liked it quite a bit. Nonzee Nimibutr from Thailand comes next with The Wheel. It's also a film that relies more on images than the story which is about cursed puppets. The images are pretty but the short is kind of lame. It's not terrible but it's definitely the low point of this anthology. And then we come to Peter Chan's contribution Going Home. This one is the reason to watch this film. Gorgeously shot by master cinematographer Christopher Doyle it's about a cop and his son who move into a new apartment building. The boy is annoyed by a small creepy girl who lives across the way and one day he disappears. While looking for his son the cop discovers that the neighbor whom he thought was the girl's father is involved in some weird stuff. This one is just outstanding  and completely emotionally draining  and it gets better the more I think about it.".

The 2nd installment is somewhat a disappointment after the great first one. Poor acting no interest for the characters and not at all scary.

But I guess that to fully enjoy the film one should take it AS IT IS with any interpretation of the purported metaphorical significance of the spiral following laterin my case much much later if ever.While 'Tell Me Something' bad luck of all bad lucks was the muchmaligned film in the lineupwith good reason.

What I'm interested is how did these 2 episodes work upon the emotion of fear as it's a given fact that such feeling is the one that films of the horror genre want to arouse mainly from the audience.In 'Memories' where does fear spring forth? As it turns out it's from the husband'sBoSeok Jongghost of his own making so to speak as there's a terrible secret that he tries painfully to conceal. He may have succeeded in keeping it from other people's notice but definitely not from the prodding of his own conscience thus the hallucinations and nightmareseven if it appears that these don't seriously bother him at all!.As it should be the viewers don't completely have any idea about this secret at the start of the film but through Kim's skillful interweaving of the husband's and the lost woman'sHyeSuk Kimrespective sceneshe as he confronts his terrifying nightmaresshe as she wanders through a barelyinhabited city where various omens singularly happen to herall told with little use of dialogues it little by little builds up toward the grisly revelation its utterly nightmarish quality is like Franz Kafka and Edgar Allan Poe have joined forces for the modern times.The director may have relied on old tricks to scare the audienceanyway it worked but the best thing is that we can make sense of  the fear thus evoked we can connect with it. And this the fear of having done a terrible misdeed and of having to face up with the nightmaresor bad memoriesthat consequently spin out of one's own sinful actwhether one gets away with it or not.On the other hand watching 'Going Home' is like watching an assortment of 'Psycho' 'Awakenings' and 'The Sixth Sense.' However it's of such a potent tragicomic quality that the viewers are still put under the spell brought into force by a marvelous confluence of terrific performanceswith Leon Lai at the forefrontand astounding mood photographypredominantly slimy greenby Wong KarWai's recording angel Christopher Doyle.Going through my files I came upon my few notes on an early work by Chan 'He's a Man She's a Woman'featuring the late Leslie Cheung a hilarious comedy of errorscumugly duckling talecumgay film. Having this film in mind as I try to recollect 'Going Home' it makes sense why odd humor shows up from some nooks and crannies of this otherwise poignant and eerie tale of the transgressive power of love. Handled foolishly this uncomfortable blending of humor and horror might've churned out another lowgrade and campy shocker'Starship Troopers' and 'The House on Haunted Hill' anyone?.Whenever the emotion of fear is aroused in us by this awarded episode it's FOR Leon Lai's bespectacled agonizing characterfor his not being able to bring up the kind of family that he deserves for his failure to achieve what could've constituted his happiness in this temporal lifethe episode's title in fact implies being with one's family.

'Memories' by acclaimed director JeeWoon is oddly both totally predictable and yet full of interesting ideas that never come to fruition. This however is by far the most palatable of the bunch with some nice artistic touches here and there. The second feature 'The Wheel' is truly an exercise in tedium. Made on the cheap and a nonexistent hackneyed plot the word unbearable springs to mind. The last feature 'Going Home' starts out with promise but quickly fizzles out. What little story there is is ridiculous and paper thin. Above all there is absolutely nothing extreme about these movies aside from a minute or two of totally outofplace gore that seems to have been edited into 'Memories' though the scene serves no purpose and the chills are virtually nonexistent.

	onyx:emotionText "I'm nearly 100 sure that these were submissions for the first film that didn't make the cut. 'Memories' by acclaimed director JeeWoon is oddly both totally predictable and yet full of interesting ideas that never come to fruition. This however is by far the most palatable of the bunch with some nice artistic touches here and there. The second feature 'The Wheel' is truly an exercise in tedium. Made on the cheap and a nonexistent hackneyed plot the word unbearable springs to mind. The last feature 'Going Home' starts out with promise but quickly fizzles out. What little story there is is ridiculous and paper thin. Above all there is absolutely nothing extreme about these movies aside from a minute or two of totally outofplace gore that seems to have been edited into 'Memories' though the scene serves no purpose and the chills are virtually nonexistent. It would be an enormous challenge to find much to recommend here.";

The first two segments sucked the first segments started out kinda creepy but it started to go in the cheap scare direction and nothing about this segment was memorable and the title of the first segment is Memories. The second segment is the worst out of the three and really hated it super boring as hell to watch and absolutely nothing about it was scary. The thought of creepy puppets being cursed may seem like a okay idea but the direction and everything about this crap is boring. Seeing how the director screwed up for just a short segment his other films must suck as well. I just really disliked this segment. The third segment is my favorite one in this film and if the other segments was good as the last one I would have really enjoyed this movie. The plot is about a cop that moves to a apartment with his son and the person living near them is a necrophiliac or seem like it. I liked how when you think one thing of what is actually going on it changes to something else and keeps you guessing. I enjoyed this segment and if the other segments was good as this one I would have given this film a way higher score but as a film itself overall I didn't like it because the first two segments sucked big time. Just do yourself a favor and skip to the last segment Going Home.3.810".

When everyone who comes into contact with it suddenly experiences grave encounters a local boy tries to find a way to end the curse. Overall this one was quite enjoyable with their being a lot to like here. The main part of this one is the fact that the atmosphere created with the puppets is pretty chilling as their mannequinlike looks and highlyelaborate decorations make them gorgeous to look at with a sinister air beneath the facade and that creates a really lasting impression here. That the backstory about the rival clans and curses brought along makes for quite a fun time here with this one really getting a chance to play that up with the different situations encountered throughout here from ghostly executioners and general pains around the body to supernatural fires and possession that becomes quite creepy along the way. While this one does get a little confusing with all the slowmotion shots that tend to go on forever distorting the dialog to make it pretty tough to figure out what's going on in the later half the atmosphere and pacing are more than enough to hold this up.The Bad Stories MemoriesAwaking from a car accident a woman with no memory tries to piece the puzzles of her identity back together while her husband seeks to find the reason of her strange disappearance. As more and more clues come together they gradually realize the strange rationale for both situations. Frankly the only thing really enjoyable here is the finale twist which manages to come off quite nicely and has a lot of great scares present here because of that. The main problem is the fact that these are so late into the segment that the rest of it being taken up with the strange mystery is just excruciating to get through. The lowkey pace and dramalike feel of the situations don't help matters as barely anything happens beyond their friends questioning each other while she runs around trying to find the cause of her condition. None of this is really engrossing material nor built for generating scares and as a whole this one is pretty weak.Going HomeMoving into an apartment complex a man and his son try to get along with a reclusive neighbor who keeps his comatose wife in their apartment. When the son goes missing and the search leads him to the apartment he finds a far more sinister reason behind the wife's condition. This one really could've been great and was certainly full of positive points here with the engrossing mystery and strange behavior setting up a really chilling setpiece later on when he comes barging in looking for his son and that's when this one turns south by having the kidnapper really be more compassionate and caring rather than a sadistic captor which makes the rationale for holding him all the weirder. None of these scenes really drive up the horror atmosphere all that much by keeping this one so lowkey and dramabased that it really doesn't offer many thrills here. That's also in keeping with the final half where the backstory is finally revealed which steers this one even further away from horror into a dark romance effort that doesn't do much for keeping this one all that scary. It's a real missed opportunity.Rated R Graphic Violence Language Nudity and childreninjeopardy.".

Although it's marketed as a sequel to the similar THREE EXTREMES in the west it's actually a standalone movie that was retitled to tiein with that film.Sadly this turns out to be a pretty dire film one you'll need a lot of patience to sit through. It takes a long time for anything decent to emerge during the running time and until that point we're stuck with subpar filmmaking.The first South Korean story is middling at best. It's a rather pretentious retelling of a similar story that was played out with Ian Hendry as the main actor in the Amicus portmanteau TALES FROM THE CRYPT some thirty years ago. The director goes for an artyfarty approach emphasising style over substance but the resultant film is dull and the twist ending is so obvious as to be barely worth bothering with. In an attempt to spice up the mix some generic gorescare sequences are thrown in too but they add little to a listless and unengaging tale.If the first story was routine then the second is completely diabolical. This is the Thai effort about some dolls that have the power to bring about a curse following the death of their owner. There's no story to it and certainly no scares whatsoever just lots of aimless camera shots of Khon dancing and some very bad acting indeed. Even worse the final twist is utterly insulting an unwelcome throwback to Dallas.The third and final story turns out to be actually rather good although I doubt if anyone will still be awake for it at this point. It's a Chinese tale about families living in a rundown tower block that starts off rather predictably before getting better and better. The reliable Eric Tsang stars as a father of a rather precocious youngster who runs off with a spooky little girl and the story draws in Tsang's hermitlike neighbour a doctor caring for his sick wife. This story is unpredictable throughout complete with plenty of creepy moments and a genuinely unsettling ending which makes you sit back and mull over what's come before. It's just a shame that the first two tales weren't on this level".

Nonzee Nimibutr's The Wheel has an old man dying and leaving behind puppets which are cursed and start to come to life. Peter HoSun Chan's Going Home has a cop searching for his missing son when he is kidnapped by a man who keeps his wife locked inside their apartment. These three films aren't any good but the first and third one are the most interesting. The second film dealing with the puppet is quite poor without any good moment. The first and third stories are the best.".

Some guy's handphone went off exactly 7 times during the whole thing and it sorta lost the atmosphere for me.  But i must say that it was disturbing.

Now I would recommend that you watch the first movie My Wife is a Gangster before you watch part two but it is not a necessity as this movie does well as a standalone but having seen the first movie just adds more background and understanding to the character.The story is about Eunjin played by EunKyung Shin who is a feared and ruthless gangster boss who ends up with amnesia after a massive fight. With no memory of her former life she is taken in by Jaecheol played by Jun Gyu Park who runs a local restaurant business. Eunjin helps around in the kitchen and drives out with the takeaway orders. But gangsters are moving in on the neighborhood in order to buy the tenants out to make room for a new big mall and Eunjin's memory is slowly returning...Actually the story is as much fun as it is actionpacked and there is something for everyone in this movie. The action sequences were nicely orchestrated and shot and the comedy throughout the movie was wellplaced and situational great. Which added together nicely for a very enjoyable movie.The characters in the movie were well detailed and nicely portrayed each bringing something unique to the storyline. And the villain well he was just hilarious especially with that contraption around his neck that sometimes altered his voice.As a movie in the action comedy genre there isn't really anything new or mindblowing to be seen in My Wife is a Gangster 2 but still the movie is entertaining and fun to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "I finally saw My Wife is a Gangster 2 and enjoyed it a lot even though I didn't have the luxury of English subtitles and had to figure out what was going on which thankfully wasn't very hard. The story filled with clichs mostly revolves around Shin EunGyeong's character having lost her memory after falling from a building during a fight Don't ask! and trying to remember who she was gradually stumbling upon clues and elements from her past. A lot of characters make a comeback from the first one so it still feels true to the original but I don't think some of them were used enough or appropriately. The movie wasn't filled with fighting as the trailer seemed to suggest there rather was slightly less fight scenes than in the first one I would say. There's still a large dose of action but those of you expecting something action packed which this series isn't might be deceived. Worth noting Zhang Ziyi makes a cameo appearance at some point which I thought was very cool  In the end it's a pretty entertaining movie which follows the secret Korean law which stipulates there must be at least one sad moment no matter how untimely plugged it might be and as far as sequels go it gets a good score. It wasn't as fresh or funny as the original but give it a chance if you're a fan of the genre and don't miss it if you loved the first one.".

	schema:headline " A quirky and realistic slice of Korea with Bogie!";
	schema:reviewBody "Battle Circus is interesting to compare to the TV series MASH. On TV the camp of the medicos was a little too clean and the doctors especially Hawkeye were always a little too ready with a joke. The oneliners never stopped at the 4077th and there were few characters especially in the last few years who were not everready to spew out endless dreary puns galore. Battle Circus is interesting in that it shows I imagine a more sober and realistic view of life in a MASH unit.Because they are located near the ever shifting front of the Korean conflict the MASH must constantly move with it. This brings out the greatest strength of this film a large number of scenes in this movie are dedicated to showing the teamwork and beehive like energy of the grunts of the unit taking tents down putting tents up moving the hospital here then to there often through or frighteningly near enemy fire all the while dedicated to keeping their patients alive. The many minutes of film spent on these thankless and gloryless activities increases our appreciation of the realities of the soldiers' daily routine.Here there are few luxuries unlike on the TV MASH where many of the characters seem to have as many possessions as the Howells did on Gilligan's Island. Conditions in the personal tents of the characters are especially Spartan. Bogie's only possession seems to be a bottle of Scotch. When there is no time to bring everything with them the soldiers burn whatever they must leave behind. Again the starkness of existence suggests to this viewer a wonder that not all of the MASH members didn't go insane on a regular basis.Now I am not a June Allyson fan and while the romance between Bogie and her is not all that interesting or convincing it is not a complete waste of film either. I don't believe I have ever seen Humphrey Bogart smile and laugh and be so unpessimistic in a film before and this is quite entertaining Bogie even falls in the mud losing his dignity and laughs about it with June Allyson! Yikes!. There is no such thing as useless celluloid when Bogie is on screen. However these episodes of lighthearted Bogie are surrounded by plenty of periods of brooding and cynical Bogie so he is not completely out of character.Robert Keith's colonel with the highpitched voice complements Bogie's doctor very nicely in their scenes together. Keenan Wynn is also a terrific surprise I usually find his raspy voice and abrasive characters unpleasant but here he plays perhaps the most likable character a cando sergeant in the whole film. His affection for a wounded Korean boy has the potential to be hokey but he pulls it off very nicely.One more MASH comparison. Bogie's character like Hawkeye Pierce is a womanchaser and a man who wants no more authority than necessary as well as a first rate surgeon. But unlike Hawkeye who is afraid of guns Humphrey Bogart is as willing to pick up a rifle and fire at the enemy as he is top pick up a scalpel. A real man's man.Don't expect Gone With the Wind and you will find this a quite interesting and quirky little war film.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to believe that Richard Brooks he of In Cold Blood and The Professionals directed this. Having coincidentally seen another Korean War film One Minute to Zero immediately before this one I can vouch for the fact that Battle Circus is a major improvement. However that in itself is no great recommendation. Humphrey Bogart is his usual excellent self professional and expert in his handling of the role of a MASH unit doctor. And June Allyson is endearing and fine in her role as the nurse who loves him. But despite the fact that plenty of screen romances have survived a greater age difference between couples than the 18 years that separates Bogart and Allyson Bogart just comes off as uncomfortably old to be pulling the kind of shenanigans he tries with Allyson here. Never mind that in real life Bogart's fairytale romance with Lauren Bacall was between two people 25 years apart in age  this is the movies and at 53 Bogart seems slightly creepy forcing his attentions on a young nurse and getting somewhat pissy when she dares to ask if he has a wife. Nonetheless the performances are good and occasionally overcome a difficult script difficult not in complexity but in mediocrity. Robert Keith who seems to have managed a long Hollywood career without ever varying his performances one whit does what he always does as Bogart's commanding officer. Keenan Wynn is substantial and believable as the tough sergeant who keeps things running. But outside of a couple of intense moments such as the one where a terrified North Korean soldier  Philip Ahn  threatens to blow up the operating room the movie hovers like a helicopter over the noman's land between drama and soap opera unable quite to make up its mind where to set down.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an interesting movie. It's not the best war movie you'll ever see it's not the most exciting movie you'll ever see and it's not one of Humphrey Bogart's best movies by a long shot. But it's still very interesting in its own way. I was intrigued by it at first because it's the story of a MASH unit in the Korean War  long before MASH the TV series or MASH the movie or MASH the book. To be honest I really hadn't been aware that a story that focused specifically on a MASH unit had been done before that. I have to say that I enjoyed this much more than I enjoyed MASH the movie. This seemed to take a far more serious approach to the subject and it seemed to stay on topic far better. It makes many of the same points that author Richard Hooker would make in his 1968 book and that would be the inspiration for the later movie and TV series of the same name  the pointlessness of war the heroics of the medical teams and the need for those involved to just find a way  any way  through whether that meant alcohol or sex or I suppose anything else. It's different though in that it portrays a much more positive picture of the military.Bogart played Major Webb second in command of MASH 8666. He's a bit of a lonely figure with a past that doesn't really get explored much but he's obviously a superb doctor. Into his life comes Lt. Ruth McGara June Allyson and they develop an interesting relationship that both sometimes fight against that sometimes neither takes very seriously and that seems to eventually develop into something real. There wasn't really much passion or chemistry between them but the relationship seemed believable to me in the circumstances where such relationships probably come and go pretty quickly depending on who gets transferred where and when. It's a cautious relationship understandably and so perhaps the emotional connection that sometimes seems lacking actually works. It's that relationship that's the plot device that moves this forward.Interspersed are vignettes of war. The hospital comes under fire on occasion it's constantly on the move to keep up with wherever the front happens to be there's some reflection on the impact of the war on Korean civilians and the most exciting scene of the movie is probably the North Korean prisoner who manages to smuggle a grenade into the hospital. It's not an exciting actionpacked war movie. It seems to simply give a look at the life of those serving in a MASH unit and it seems to be one of the many tribute sort of movies that were made in the era. Although casualties are certainly present throughout it's also not at all graphic in its depictions and even understanding the greater sensitivities the industry at the time had to such things I found it ridiculous that Webb could perform chest surgery on a young Korean boy which included an open heart massage and yet apparently not get a spot of blood on him while doing it!It's not great. I would call it interesting mostly for its look at a MASH unit before MASH. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "Battle Circus 1953An awkward movie with really uneven acting and some routine or worse dialog. Even the battle actions scenes which have along history of success in Hollywood are sometimes clumsy. You have to accept all this up front to get anywhere further here and appreciate the sincere shreds of insight into a little known aspect of war and of the Korean War in particular at the timethe mobile hospitals that followed the front line fighting.Of course MASH the movie and then MASH the t.v. show took the idea and made it everyday material with a notsohidden commentary on the Vietnam war. Battle Circus is unusual in coming right as the Korean Conflict was ending the war ended in 1953 and a decade before Vietnam grew into an actual war for the U.S. And so it is very interestingif you are a student of war and war movies that is. It's a bit of a slog as a drama however even watching the kinds of vehicles in use or the hardships of weather and war. The methods of setting up these hospitals so quickly is quite accurate and the army cooperated with some of the filming.There is also Humphrey Bogart. When an actor reaches his kind of fame even his lesser movies take on meaning. He has a central role as a leading officer in the group and of course he has nearmisses and a few nearkisses with the womennurseswho are the center of activities. He's portrayed as a womanizing practical man not especially nice but eventually very admirablelike many of his characters in fact. Some of the scenes are quite serious and strong taken by themselves. But they get beaten down by the stiff romance that is forced on Bogart and his counterpart June Allyson. She has to play a naive smart wellmeaning girl next door and while that might be the truth sometimes it makes for a kind of false setup and she's a lightweight presence. So the movie stumbles along in a weird zone. The decision of Altman making MASH to turn it truly comic was essential the humor here is rare and flat like falling in the mud. So tune out in the love scenes and get absorbed in the genuine intensity of the best of the staged war scenes and the hospital dynamics. The title by the way is suggested very early when Allyson cheerfully says that moving the tents every few days is just like a real circus on the move.".

	schema:reviewBody "Battle Circus 1953  out of 4 MGM drama about a MASH unit in Korea and a doctor Humphrey Bogart who falls for a new nurse June Allyson. This is a pretty strange film that didn't quite work with me and I think a lot of that is due to the rather poor screenplay that never knows what it's trying to be. It starts off as a war drama then moves into a romantic comedy and then at the end tries to turn into something else. The moods of the film are constantly changing to the point where you don't know what or how you're suppose to be feeling. Bogart was an interesting choice for the role here because he's having to put on the charm from scene one until the end. Many have found his performance bad here but I thought he handled it pretty well. The sweet talk stuff doesn't sound right coming from someone like Bogart but that's why I found it charming. Allyson isn't nearly as strong in her role but she's adorable enough. Bogart and her do a nice job together although I had a hard time believing he'd actually fall so hard for her. I've read several comments that have attacked the film and Bogart's character because he's pretty much sexually harassing the woman throughout the movie. Even when she wants nothing to do with him he still uses his power as a doctor to touch her and so on. I personally didn't take this stuff that serious as I don't think it was meant to be seen as any sort of harassment. In the end the film doesn't work and turns out to be one of the legendary star's lesser films.".

	schema:headline " Excellent first look at a MASH unit filmed during wartime";
	schema:reviewBody "This 1953 movie by MGM was filmed in the U.S. and hit theaters while the Korean War then called a police action or conflict was still going on. It was a precursor of the 1970 movie M.A.S.H. and the long running and highly popular TV series by the same name. It's only natural to compare the two films and to compare them with the TV series that began 15 years after Battle Circus. The TV series ran from 1972 through 1983 and was one of my alltime favorites. Some reviewers have commented on the more witty dialog in the later film and series but I wonder how much of that might have been due to the change in our culture in the almost 20 years since the end of the Korean War. I wasn't aware of this earlier film about a MASH unit recent years. But viewing it now gives a good perspective on that time and the experiences of the MASH units and personnel. In WW II Europe my dad was a medic who then became a medical officer. He served in Japan and then stateside during the Korean War. The medical corps officers who were not doctors in those days were the ones in charge of the rest of the work to keep the medical services going  administration supply transport meals moving and setting up etc. Battle Circus shows what all the support people did and gives us an excellent picture of the work that went into the mobility of the MASH units. So for that aspect alone this film tops the later movie and series in its realism. As to the match of Bogart and Allyson for a romantic touch I ask why not? Bogie's character had the rank of major so he would likely have been an MD who stayed in the service  active or reserves  after WW II. It seems to me in real life that there have been some famous couples with considerable age differences. And during war might not a young green nurse fall for an older doctor in the service? I think that's just another touch of reality for this film. Sometimes matches other than the usual Hollywood fare might be best or more real. I think this one was right on target. When viewing a film I try to get into the movie before me with no preconceptions and without a Hollywoodinfluenced agenda of what the proper match should be for a film romance. That lets me best consider the actors for their performances and how their roles fit in the story. The acting script cinematography and scenery chosen for this film were all very good. As one of the very few films that have shown medical care in modern war Battle Circus scores an A for its historical value alone.".

Humphrey Bogart plays Major Jed Webbe an overage man on the prowl and June Allyson a nurse who is going to win the war single handedly. Bogart and Allyson have little chemistry together and their love scenes are hard to watch.

They are forced to tear down and move to new locations frequently as the war closes in on them. Those sequences are good. The helicopter bringing the wounded was used in the opening of the TV series.Also in the cast are Keenan Wynn as the crusty Sergeant who is in charge of all of the moves between locations Robert Keith as the Commanding Officer Lt. Col. Walters and William Campbell as Capt. Rusty Rustford the helicopter pilot.This was Bogey's only film for A studio MGM. He should have stuck to the trench coat and folded down fedora.".

The tents and helicopter presage MASH. The scene with the grenade is tense. I found the developing love affair to be touching and honest which is something I never expected. The combination of Allyson and Bogart is great because it is hard to imagine two actors cast more against type this is perhaps what made the romance credible. Then you get actors like Keenan Wynn and Robert Keith giving solid support. And don't ignore the fine actresses playing the nurses and exploring the challenges of doing such work with tremendous challenges. Way more adult than most war movies.

	schema:reviewBody "The Korean war had already found its way on to American movie screens when BATTLE CIRCUS came along. And some of those other films like FIXED BAYONETS! and THE STEEL HELMET are infinitely better. But this slick MGM production has its merits and should be watched if anything for the script and direction by Richard Brooks.Less convincing though is the casting of June Allyson and Humphrey Bogart in the lead roles. Does anyone really think they have much chemistry? I will concede there is a slightly romantic scene where they run through the rain and fall in the mud. But eventually that gets gooey in more ways than one. And how does this make us relate to these characters and the deeply personal bond they have managed to forge given the circumstances of their immediate situation? What helps us temporarily forget the more inane aspects of their relationship are the key action sequences depicted in the story. And those moments convey a great deal of tension and are very well staged. The movie also gets points for knowing that the 'M' in MASH stands for mobile. We see the main characters uproot and move around to administer to the injured and dying like they would be required to do in such a dangerous environment.".

But this slick MGM production has its merits and should be watched if anything for the script and direction by Richard Brooks.Less convincing though is the casting of June Allyson and Humphrey Bogart in the lead roles. Does anyone really think they have much chemistry? I will concede there is a slightly romantic scene where they run through the rain and fall in the mud. But eventually that gets gooey in more ways than one. And how does this make us relate to these characters and the deeply personal bond they have managed to forge given the circumstances of their immediate situation? What helps us temporarily forget the more inane aspects of their relationship are the key action sequences depicted in the story. And those moments convey a great deal of tension and are very well staged. The movie also gets points for knowing that the 'M' in MASH stands for mobile. We see the main characters uproot and move around to administer to the injured and dying like they would be required to do in such a dangerous environment.";

As for June Alysson she plays a complete dummy as each time Bogey makes totally inappropriate advances on her she blames herself for his piglike behaviors!!

	schema:reviewBody "Rather dreary Korean War drama where everybody appears to be performing by the numbers. There's none of the intensity expected of those lifeanddeath situations that distinguish the era's better war films Bridges of TokoRi Pork Chop Hill Retreat Hell!. The action never really gels which I suppose is the fault of director Garnett who appears disengaged from what's on screen. It doesn't help that the screenplay also appears stitched together from a host of war movie clichs few of which stick around long enough to establish themselvesthe wives the ethnic grunts the lonely orphan. It's like a runner in baseball thinking he has to touch all 100 bases before he can score.Of course the film does contain one dramatic highlight that caused considerable controversy at the time but has since proved revealingthe intentional shelling of civilian refugees by American forces. The screenplay tries to soften the impact with North Korean infiltrators holding refugees at gunpoint but the destruction occurs anyway. Now that was really a pretty gutsy move on somebody's part since the war was still going on when the movie was released in 1952.Though not publicized at the time we now know from proved incidents such as No GunRi There was more than one eyewitness and the only dispute is over the number killed that such atrocities did occur on our side as well as the enemy's. And though not included in highschool history texts there was considerable sympathy for the North from the peasantry of the South because of the landlorddominated government of the South many of which had collaborated with hated Japanese occupiers during WWII. As a result considerable guerilla activity occurred in the South both before and during the war itself. Details such as these cast light on the basic accuracy of the movie's depiction. Ironically the problem for GI's was the same here as in Vietnamhow to distinguish friendly civilians from the enemy while too often the solution was to kill them all. But when your own life is on the line what do you do? That's why Mitchum's Col. Janowski is so torn.Apparently studio honcho Howard Hughes had high hopes for the production since his name appears above the title. And even though the seams from stock footage are pretty obvious the film is well produced with locations at Fort Carson Colorado where the terrain was said to resemble that of Korea. But background and special effects can hardly compensate for the general listlessness of the results or the illconceived Ann Blyth role. Nonetheless the movie does remain memorable for its one revealing episode.".

The action never really gels which I suppose is the fault of director Garnett who appears disengaged from what's on screen. It doesn't help that the screenplay also appears stitched together from a host of war movie clichs few of which stick around long enough to establish themselvesthe wives the ethnic grunts the lonely orphan. It's like a runner in baseball thinking he has to touch all 100 bases before he can score.Of course the film does contain one dramatic highlight that caused considerable controversy at the time but has since proved revealingthe intentional shelling of civilian refugees by American forces. The screenplay tries to soften the impact with North Korean infiltrators holding refugees at gunpoint but the destruction occurs anyway. Now that was really a pretty gutsy move on somebody's part since the war was still going on when the movie was released in 1952.Though not publicized at the time we now know from proved incidents such as No GunRi There was more than one eyewitness and the only dispute is over the number killed that such atrocities did occur on our side as well as the enemy's. And though not included in highschool history texts there was considerable sympathy for the North from the peasantry of the South because of the landlorddominated government of the South many of which had collaborated with hated Japanese occupiers during WWII. As a result considerable guerilla activity occurred in the South both before and during the war itself. Details such as these cast light on the basic accuracy of the movie's depiction. Ironically the problem for GI's was the same here as in Vietnamhow to distinguish friendly civilians from the enemy while too often the solution was to kill them all. But when your own life is on the line what do you do? That's why Mitchum's Col. Janowski is so torn.Apparently studio honcho Howard Hughes had high hopes for the production since his name appears above the title. And even though the seams from stock footage are pretty obvious the film is well produced with locations at Fort Carson Colorado where the terrain was said to resemble that of Korea. But background and special effects can hardly compensate for the general listlessness of the results or the illconceived Ann Blyth role. Nonetheless the movie does remain memorable for its one revealing episode.";

	schema:headline " Cold War Film With World War II Ideals.";
	schema:reviewBody "One Minute To Zero is a cold war film about Korea very typical of its time.  President Truman called it a police action like we were going there to arrest Kim Il Sung and his cronies.  It sure looked like a war from the point of view of the World War II veterans and their younger brothers who fought it.Robert Mitchum plays one of those veterans a career army man who rose from the ranks to become a Colonel.  He's training the South Korean Army when the North attacks.  His personal story is interwoven with the progress of the war from the initial attack until the landings at Inchon. Mitch is every inch the combat soldier in this film.And Mitch falls big time for widow Ann Blyth a United Nations worker. When the UN was founded post World War II a lot of people put hope and faith in it that it would prevent future wars and it would deter aggression with force if need be.  The only reason it got into Korea was because the Russians were boycotting the Security Council at the time and couldn't veto anything.  A gambit they never used again. Ann is a World War II widow who believes she's carrying out the ideals her husband fought for.  Lots of folks felt that way back in 1950.Director Tay Garnett did a good job editing in real combat footage with his actors.  The film has a good sense of realism.But it's a good romantic story as well helped along by one of the most durable popular songs in history.  When I Fall In Love came from this film heard in the background but never sung.  Curious because Ann Blyth is an excellent singer.  Nat King Cole and Doris Day had hit records of it when the film was first out.  Later on Etta James The Lettermen Donny Osmond Natalie Cole all did well by this song.  And right up to the present day Celine Dion and Clive Griffin did a duet record back in 1993.  The good ones always survive and I wouldn't bet against a future hit single for some artist with this one.There is one scene in this that would definitely jar today's audiences. At one point Mitchum directs his men to fire into a group of refugees who the North Koreans are using as a blind to smuggle men and arms into the South.  And the movie makes sure you see that that was the case. I don't doubt such things happened.  They're happening today.  But the movie verdict acquits Mitchum and assuages Ann Blyth that she shouldn't doubt her man.  What CNN would do with that today.The supporting cast includes Charles McGraw Wally Cassell and William Talman.  All do a good job.It's a double treat.  Lots of action for the men and plenty of romance for the women or the other way around if that's what floats your boat.".

Compare this to most other films about the Korean war which could have been set in Asia or Europe during the second world war .It does have a few flaws  for example theres some painfully obvious real life film footage used and some of the battle scenes  especially the sequence with a soldier being killed by a flame thrower  could have been more graphic but I suppose thats down to what you could show on screen in 1952 so perhaps thats not a valid criticism . What is however is the inclusion of a love story which drags the story down some what . Women wont want to watch ONE MINUTE TO ZERO  because of the large number of combat scenes while fans of war films  Who I guess are exclusively male  will find the love story intrusive .

But then Janowski ends up bombing South Korean refugees .Love That Lived with Danger! Back of every man of action ... there's a woman made for love . Korean war action film divides its time between an army romance  Robert MitchumAnn Blyth and war action . This is an allegedly true story in which various military served as technical advisors as Army Capt. Edward R. Harrison Lt. Col. S. Paul Latiolais  and Dr. Henry De Young  a former Korean Minister to Gen. Douglas MacArthur's headquarters  and in fact  it used 175 Korean War veterans as extras . Howard Hughes' RKO didn't waste much time in getting neither a great film  nor a notable drama on screen  being a medium budget movie  but an acceptable flick . Stock footage was used to fill in the background and is far more striking than anything the writers could up with . Besides  the blend of battle scenes and romance never amounts too much . Pure sentimental slop  it is a stirring and sometimes moving tale  accompanying some spectacular aerial scenes and impressive bombing behind enemy lines . As for the aerial scenes were used Mustang fighter planes from Buckley Field in Denver and F80 jets . The lukewarm melodrama features Robert Mitchum as a tough Colonel who quickly achieves the confidence of the other soldiers around him at the same time he sings a Japanese song . Ann Blyth delivers a decent acting as the beautiful officer and widow who finds out about the horrors of war when she falls in love .Produced at a cost of millions to bring you a million thrills by the powerful producer Edmund Grainger .Being professionally directed by Tay Garnett  though including flaws as well as gaps  and extremely sentimental . Tay was a good Hollywood craftsman . Tay entered films in 1920 as a screenwriter . After a stint as a gag writer for Mack Sennett and Hal Roach he joined Pathe then the distributor for both competing comedy producers and in 1928 began directing for that company . Garnett garnered some attention in the early 1930s with such films as Bad company 1931 and Way Passage 1932  but his best work came in the mid'30s and early 1940s with such films as S.O.S.

Particularly unusual and gruesome is a quick shot about 30 minutes into the film of a charred corpse lieing on a hull of a burnedout tank.Robert Mitchum cruises through this movie quite handily he basically plays himself. He is a very likable actor and I admire him greatly but he plays this role with what appears to be very little effort  and I mean that as a compliment  I think he was just born to play characters like this. A great actor with commanding screen presence.Mitchum's blossoming romance with Ann Blythe is managed quite interestingly both characters are a little older so there is no heavy panting rather their early love scenes are surprisingly gentle slightly but pleasantly awkward and quite tender Mitchum's first kiss for Ann is on her cheek. A nice change of pace indeed though I think she is kind of tiny for him.The director made sure to include a handful of clichd Yankee soldiers the innocent and comic chef turned warrior the two buddies one of whom kind of bullies the other only to have the other save the life of the first like a faithful dog and so on. But they are not too overdone.And I never tire of seeing American soldiers of different rank be able to joke with each other recognizing each other's innate goodness and patriotism while still respecting rank. And cheesy as it is Mitchum's compliments and mentoring of the embattled captain played by Richard Egan are just plain heartwarming and pleasing.A very interesting little film of the forgotten war Korea. Don't expect too much just sit back and enjoy the kind of film they don't make anymore.".

	schema:reviewBody "How someone as workmanlike as director Tay Garnett could take talents the like of Robert Mitchum and Charles McGraw and crank out this piece of sausage is pretty hard to fathom. It's not that the story is so bad for its time early 1950s but that the execution is so poor. Mitchum manages to be good insofar as the worst dialog of his career allows him and McGraw is loaded down with even worse talk. The chemistry between Mitchum and love interest Ann Blyth is nil the story veers from sickeningly sweet to nauseatingly real courtesy of some actual combat footage of various people during or just after being roasted alive etc. and the majority of the supporting performances are amazingly amateurish for a studio picture of its time. Mitchum plays an infantry officer in Korea at the beginning of the war there. He has a bit of a queasy stomach after slaughtering a bunch of civilian refugees because a few Communist infiltrators were hiding among them but even his initially outraged girlfriend comes to see that even a doctor amputating a leg has to cut off some good flesh with the bad and pretty soon this miniMy Lai is forgotten without anyone apparently considering whether a wiser choice than massacre might have existed. But it's the amateurishness of the direction the highschoolplay sort of staging and dialog that make One Minute to Zero a title without meaning or explanation in the film an anomaly how could these people whose talent is undeniable have made such a silly and childish little home movie. The philosophy of war the details of combat and life in a war zone in general even the romance all are done with the sophistication and expertise of the average sevenyearold boy. This is the kind of movie Robert Mitchum was often accused of sleepwalking through but in reality were it not for him it would be utterly unbearable.".

Renting it and watching with my father a Korean war veteran on Veterans Day 2007 was great. Still that one segment in the movie with the terrorist hiding among a line of hundreds of Korean refugees and seeing US sends Cannon shells among the crowd was gut wrenching. Nonetheless the actual F94 Starfire jet Scenes were the most footage ever shown in a Korean war film more so than Men of the Fighting Lady a distant second.Lastly the casualty footage for a '51 '52 was shocking. However that the film contains a Romantic storyline  some comedy relief by young GI Gomer Pyle type soldier was amazing for the Director to squeeze these items in this film. This film IMO is one of better Korea war films along with Retreat Hell with Frank Lovejoy along with a couple other films like Pork Chop Hill with Greg Peck.".

	schema:reviewBody "ONE MINUTE TO ZERO is a typical American war movie with the thencontemporaneous Korean War serving as the theatre of battle in this instance. The film stars the ubiquitous Robert Mitchum as a hardbitten combat veteran and colonel in the US army tasked with helping evacuate the local population while at the same time protecting them from advancing North Korean troops. There's not much in the way of a big story here as the war itself IS the story however as a realistic depiction of battle it works very well.This is a visual film with some highly memorable combat scenes in it. Realism is enhanced through the use of reallife wartime footage and the scenes of jets firing rockets are quite incredible and never bettered by Hollywood special effects even in this day and age. I loved the tank battles as well although the film's tense highlight involves the Commies hiding inside refugee columns and ready to burst out and massacre at a moment's notice. A duck is involved in one of the film's tragic highlights. Character actors like Richard Egan Charles McGraw and William Talman flesh out realistic supporting roles although Ann Blyth's love interest suffers from the era's usual sexist depiction of women and feels like an unnecessary addition to the story.".

	schema:headline " The Korean War at its Worse";
	schema:reviewBody "There are really good movies made about the Korean War that I would highly recommend such as Porkchop Hill Fixed Bayonets Retreat Hell The Hunters Men In War and the more recently Korean produced movie Brotherhood of War. If you can push past the distracting romance scenes in this movie it would be highly recommended if for the skillful way that actual battle scenes are integrated into the story line. Though some reviewers have dismissed this movie for its clichd scenes this movie was somewhat more realistic and graphic for its time. Leave it to Howard Hughes to leave no stone unturned while striving for authenticity in his movies.Our movie starts out from the view of two veteran senior KMAAG officers Army Colonel Janowski Robert Mitchem and Air Force Colonel Parker William Talman in their attempts to train the South Korean military. These two probably thought that the worse they ever experienced in WWII was behind them until one Sunday morning in June 1950 when they are awakened to the dropping of bombs by the North Korean Air Force. Colonel Parker quips isn't this where we came in? Its even Sunday! At first we see how the war progresses through their eyes but then the movie transitions to the view point of American infantrymen desperately trying to stop the North Korean Army.This movie does a good job showing what the early days of the war was like depicting the haplessness of the poorly trained and unmotivated Americans hindered by the loss of their leaders and lack of air support. One soldier suggests bugging out but bristles when accused of cowardice. There are no heroics here just a bunch of scared soldiers. Colonel Janowski arrives to provide leadership and organization after their commander is killed by mortar fire.Establishing contact with the Air Force a series of air strikes is directed on the approaching enemy. Tanks are bombed and strafed by USAF F80s in a scene that combined special effects with real film footage. Later Royal Australian Air Force F51s napalm North Korean soldiers on a hillside leaving them to die in a sea of fire. The North Koreans were skillful infiltrators and there is a realistic scene where they sneak in behind the frontlines to attack the valuable airstrip and command post until they are outgunned in a counterattack led by a ring mounted .50 cal machine gun on a 2 12 truck.Soldiers die horrible deaths in this movie. North Korean soldiers die screaming in a sea of napalm while American soldiers are shot strangled or bayonetted by North Korean infiltrators. In a graphic scene a Hispanic soldier Lalo Rios foolishly attempts to take out a North Korean tank with only a hand grenade and is killed by a flame thrower. The sergeant Charles McGraw calls him a fool but Colonel Janowski corrects him by calling him a magnificant fool. This is not Hollywood heroics. Things like this really happen in war. After a touching scene of leaving his family without saying goodbye Colonel Parker is shot down while personally leading an aerial resupply mission and falls to his death when his parachute is set afire by AA fire. The scene reminds me of when I was a kid and used to wake up at 500 in the morning to see my dad in uniform preparing to leave for duty at the base.In another scene an Air Force forward controller is seen taking photos of the devastation and is later killed by mortar fire with his camera shown lying next to his body. My dad who is a veteran of the early days of the Korean War warned me that that I have no business acting like a tourist if I ever went to war that it would get me killed.In a memorable and controversial scene the North Koreans attempt to use refugees to infiltrate the UN lines. A tactic of the enemy in any war is to generate waves of refugees that will require the use of critical resources to feed house and care for them. That is what the communist forces in Korea did and there are breathtaking aerial scenes of miles of refugees clogging the roads. Colonel Janowski orders American artillerymen to fire on the refugee columns to turn them back. The US Army objected to this scene and threatened to withdraw support for this movie. But the military underestimated the political influence of Howard Hughes and the scene was left in the movie. As we know these incidents actually happened but unlike what some writers in the 1990s have asserted these actions were not covered up. The first volume of the US Army's history of the Korean War published in 1962 devotes five pages discussing the problems of refugees and the various methods US commanders used to control them in the early days of the war to include shooting at them. Its amazing that someone actually received a Pulitzer Prize for doing a story on old news.Though filmed in the U.S. at Fort Carson CO and at RKO's backlot studios using Korean War vets the movie looks and feels like Korea of 1950 especially with the actual combat footage weaved into the various scenes. The equipment and uniforms for the North Koreans look authentic and their tactics in the movie are realistically portrayed.In an emotional scene the movie ends with Anne Blythe's character praying for her soldier's safe return as the UN forces head north in pursuit of the defeated North Korean Army. My mother always liked the end because before she met and married my dad she lived with the mother of a soldier who was MIA in Korea in 1950. She used to accompany her to church everyday where she prayed for the safe return of not only her son but others who were serving in Korea. Anne Blythe's prayer reminds her of those dark days early in the war.".

In fact all it takes for her to see the light in mitchum's soul is to see him shell civilian refugees into kibble then justify it because 'half' of them were communist infiltrators anyway.what a ridiculous piece of propaganda. Sure wars need to be fought that is indisputable but not in every case and war movies should never be so blindingly simpleminded and stupid pandering on behalf of the Pentagon to the lowest brow audience for support. This is strictly the kind of post WW2 arrogance movie that made right wing war lovers what they are today. Let's just kick ass and shut up the pansy eggheads with a kiss because we're the real men and war is necessary everywhere all the time. Kicking ass is what God made America for talk is for lovers and a machine gun and a box of ammo is the ONLY solution always.Interesting that it was a war entered into by a left wing President. The Right Wing no doubt loved him for it taking on those commie gook cousins of Uncle Joe.Until he canned MacArthur.Brash American machismo doesn't begin to sum up this film. Fetish porn for freeps and muscleheads. It stars three of my favorite actors too. Robert Mitchum Charles McGraw and Richard Egan I would watch in anything.

Kicking ass is what God made America for talk is for lovers and a machine gun and a box of ammo is the ONLY solution always.Interesting that it was a war entered into by a left wing President. The Right Wing no doubt loved him for it taking on those commie gook cousins of Uncle Joe.Until he canned MacArthur.Brash American machismo doesn't begin to sum up this film. Fetish porn for freeps and muscleheads. It stars three of my favorite actors too. Robert Mitchum Charles McGraw and Richard Egan I would watch in anything. This just proved not everything they made is worth a damn.";

	schema:reviewBody "ONE MINUTE TO ZERO 1952 is a hokey Korean War movie filled with tired war movie clichs but it's easy enough to digest and Ann Blyth is soooooo pretty that you don't mind sitting through it.The initial conflict between Army colonel Robert Mitchum and United Nations worker Ann Blyth soon blossoms into romance but can Blyth let herself get involved with a soldier during wartime knowing he's always in harm's way? Meanwhile Mitchum and company have tough decisions to make trying to hold back the guerrilla fighters who hide among the swarms of refugees.Made while our boys were over there fighting the commies the film has an understandable propagandistic slant but it's interesting to see a movie of the era set during the Korean War rather than WWII. And the drama does touch upon some interesting moral gray areas.Robert Mitchum is always good but Charles McGraw nearly steals the show in a solid supporting performance as Mitchum's gruff sidekick in the field. Also look for Alfred the husky young janitor from MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET 1947 as one of the soldiers.The film's romantic theme seems to be the song When I Fall in Love as popularized by Nat King Cole.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Seoul ByungDoo Insung Zo is a twentynine year old gangster that works under the command of SangShui Yoon JaeMoon in the mobster organization of the boss Hwang Hojin Chun. ByungDoo is also the patriarch of his family and is having financial problems to support his old mother that is very ill and his younger siblings. When Hwang is pressed by the corrupt prosecutor Park ByungDoo sees the chance to prove his loyalty to Hwang climb positions in his criminal career and improve his income and he volunteers to get rid off Park killing him and burying his body and the secret with his partner JongSoo Ku Jin. Meanwhile his former high school friend and aspirant director Kim MinHo Min NamKoong meets him asking ByungDoo to be his adviser in his debut movie about gangsters. Later ByungDoo goes to a high school reunion with MinHo where he meets his high school crush HyunJoo Boyoung Lee and they start seeing each other. One night after arguing with HyunJoo ByungDoo gets drunk and makes confidences to MinHo about his dark secret affecting his relationship in the criminal organization and friendship with the ambitious director.Biyeolhan Geori is a great Korean movie of gangsters. The story about family friendship ambition and betrayal is engaging and disclosed in an adequate pace. The choreography of the fights is impressively realistic giving the sensation that the cast is fighting for real. The ambiguity of the lead character ByungDoo is very well developed in the screenplay and performance of Insung Zo Zo that gives the necessary credibility to his character a family man and cold blood killer. This feature has indeed the true spirit of the gangster's movies like for example Godfellas and Casino and the plot is open to interpretation since it is never clear who might be the mastermind of MinHo's betrayal.

The music score is also excellent and gives a touch of highquality to this great feature. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Caminhos do Crime Ways of the Crime".

	onyx:emotionText "In Seoul ByungDoo Insung Zo is a twentynine year old gangster that works under the command of SangShui Yoon JaeMoon in the mobster organization of the boss Hwang Hojin Chun. ByungDoo is also the patriarch of his family and is having financial problems to support his old mother that is very ill and his younger siblings. When Hwang is pressed by the corrupt prosecutor Park ByungDoo sees the chance to prove his loyalty to Hwang climb positions in his criminal career and improve his income and he volunteers to get rid off Park killing him and burying his body and the secret with his partner JongSoo Ku Jin. Meanwhile his former high school friend and aspirant director Kim MinHo Min NamKoong meets him asking ByungDoo to be his adviser in his debut movie about gangsters. Later ByungDoo goes to a high school reunion with MinHo where he meets his high school crush HyunJoo Boyoung Lee and they start seeing each other. One night after arguing with HyunJoo ByungDoo gets drunk and makes confidences to MinHo about his dark secret affecting his relationship in the criminal organization and friendship with the ambitious director.Biyeolhan Geori is a great Korean movie of gangsters. The story about family friendship ambition and betrayal is engaging and disclosed in an adequate pace. The choreography of the fights is impressively realistic giving the sensation that the cast is fighting for real. The ambiguity of the lead character ByungDoo is very well developed in the screenplay and performance of Insung Zo Zo that gives the necessary credibility to his character a family man and cold blood killer. This feature has indeed the true spirit of the gangster's movies like for example Godfellas and Casino and the plot is open to interpretation since it is never clear who might be the mastermind of MinHo's betrayal. Based on the last scene I believe JongSoo forced MinHo to snitch out ByungDoo to take over his position in the family. The music score is also excellent and gives a touch of highquality to this great feature. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Caminhos do Crime Ways of the Crime";

It sure seems like it could be happening somewhere in Korea right now and that's what may be the gimmick that will hook you. Imagine a hungry low level gangster on the rise and the murders and betrayals that go along with it. Throw in an old friend who happens to be a scriptwriter who picks the gangster's brain for authenticity for a script he is working on and there you go. After watching it a second time around I was impressed by the portrayal of the Gangster Byung Doo. When he kills it kills him inside when he fights he unleashes a fury and when he plots he is quietly cold. He is loyal to his boys to a fault but those who stand in his way no matter what their position or rank may be better watch their backs. Watch the story of the gangster on the rise and then see the consequences unfold before your eyes. The clean cut killer has his day in the sun and his heart of gold is stained with blood. The backs he stabbed return to him in a novel way in this one literally. What goes around comes around so they say. The fight scenes are chaotic and violent instead of ultra stylish. Pace is a little slow and of course there is the obligatory love interest and sad upbringing back story that tries to garner sympathy for the tragic antihero. Running WildYaSoo is more intense a drama and Bittersweet LifeDalkoman Insaeng is better in the action department. Those two movies had me pumped throughout but this one required a bit more patience. This is more of a brooding type of film that comes at you with the unique angle of the film maker as an actual character who is pivotal to the story that unfolds.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the quote in this movie describes and sums up this movie You just need to know two things to be successful. Who you need and what he needs and that basically sums up the gangster world. The movie really does show the nasty and dirty parts about being a gangster and trying to move up in the world. But the thing is the movie just have anything that really immersed you and can get a bit tedious at time. However the way it did not pull any punches was well done. This is a depressing gangster movie that shows the progress of a gangster who has morals but his direction causes conflict for his loved ones although that is not his intention. This isn't really a movie that glorifies the gangster life but it doesn't really bash on it either but it does show that it's a sad life full of hurting others and backstabbing. Even when they constantly spout things like family. I think the actor Jo In Sung is alright but he fits right into this role and his character is very believable. Overall it's a good Korean gangster flick but could have been better if it had more elements to get immersed into.

	onyx:emotionText "One of the quote in this movie describes and sums up this movie You just need to know two things to be successful. Who you need and what he needs and that basically sums up the gangster world. The movie really does show the nasty and dirty parts about being a gangster and trying to move up in the world. But the thing is the movie just have anything that really immersed you and can get a bit tedious at time. However the way it did not pull any punches was well done. This is a depressing gangster movie that shows the progress of a gangster who has morals but his direction causes conflict for his loved ones although that is not his intention. This isn't really a movie that glorifies the gangster life but it doesn't really bash on it either but it does show that it's a sad life full of hurting others and backstabbing. Even when they constantly spout things like family. I think the actor Jo In Sung is alright but he fits right into this role and his character is very believable. Overall it's a good Korean gangster flick but could have been better if it had more elements to get immersed into.

I just want to comment about the fight scenes. On the DVD they showed how they staged each one and one of the reasons they look so realistic is they weren't choreographed in the standard way. Rather than that unrealistic Tarentino style of carefully worked out 'dance moves' these were gritty intense street fightingbased scenes where it seemed like the actors were getting hurt on each one because they put so much into them. Even the lead actor had to be out on medical care for fifteen days because he got seriously injured in one fight scene. Could you imagine that happening to one of those prissy Hollywood actors? They achieved a much more realistic effect because they used no stunt men CGI or endless shooting matches where everyone keeps missing the stars over and over again. The overuse of technology is destroying the arts in general let's hope the Koreans don't fall into the same fetish with spectacle that the US and Japan other than Miike and Sono have fallen into.

The film's very well made and there's a lot more than what you would've expected. Yes it was a little slow burning in places but the overall impact made by the film was quite a strong one. Jo Insung is a terrific actor and I'll look forward to more of his movies. The screenplay is the real hero of A DIRTY CARNIVAL. Not for a moment does it let go of the grip on the viewer. The film has apart from this a lot more things to admire. The director has depicted everything very well. The character development is quite good and it's quite easy to be connected to the lead character played by the very talented Jo Insung. He's superb throughout the entire film and he rules alone with his act. Rest of the cast does a great job but he's alone enough to impress the viewers.The action scenes are extremely well choreographed and quite realistically executed on screen. The cinematography is also very good and the production values are quite good. The film however is quite long and doesn't really justify this long duration. It could've been trimmed a little bit almost close to 10 or 15 minutes for a better experience. But still the film is a delight to watch. It had me excited to know what would happen in the end. The end was really very astonishing as well as impressive at the same time.A DIRTY CARNIVAL is a well made action drama with a lot of offer as a treat to the viewers. You don't really need to have a very strong heart to watch this film. What all you need...is to watch this film!".

These are the most rewarding in my opinion because having allowed ourselves to be so absorbed and entrenched in their sagas our empathic connection with their characters can almost make us feel like we are intertwined and we can come away feeling enriched for having shared our time with them.

High strung frigid and apparently callous Hae Won isn't especially likable but as things go on we see why she might be this way for the small island where she grew up is a pretty terrible place. Her reunion may be sweet but Boknam is in a bad situation and things are building to a headThe plot summary on this page tells more than is strictly needed about the skimpy plot of this one it's predictable stuff but I still recommend not knowing to much beforehand all the better to get emotionally wrecked. Director Jang Cheolso plays the audience like an instrument highlighting the natural beauty of the location to better emphasise the nastiness keeping the harsher moments just enough in the frame to be viciously effective but keeping the worst of it just out of view conjuring jangling tension and a dash of sinister sexual menace its taut stuff building effectively with tar black humour in its climatic release. Ji Sungwong puts on a decent if distant show as Haewon implacable to the point of being a frustration while Seo Yeonghee is the more attractive as Boknam lively faade in desperate conflict with her terrible treatment a pleasant soul who doesn't want to face things but wrenched to a place where she can't hide. The notion of denial and the need to face up to things is what underlies events unsubtly presented perhaps but a worthy message presented in jolting style fortunately the film works as grim drama. There are problems though none of the villains of the piece are well rounded from crudely brutal and sex hungry men to cruel old ladies revelling in the status quo everyone is so hissable that things are in constant danger of being overdone and indeed sometimes are. Documented cases of similar isolated communities show that there is a bleak truthfulness to the pattern of events but the characters of the villains generally lack psychological truth hence they become less effective. The other trouble here is that the film draws out its finale with more climaxes than necessary it doesn't lack for exciting or interesting events in its final stages but it becomes bumpy and feels overlong it also hammers home the less subtle aspects of the film. Still all in all this one had the required effect for me I was gripped appalled dazzled and saddened a veritable emotional rollercoaster.

	schema:headline " Another masterpiece of a unique genre coming from a unique country";
	schema:reviewBody "Bedevilled is another and once again brilliant tale of revenge coming from South Korea which is in the vein of already now legendary masterpieces such as Oldboy and I saw the devil.What distinguishes this movie from the other ones and justifies itself to merit a place in the top notch of this genre can be told in three little points. First of all this movie tells the tale of revenge from the point of view from a person that is neither the central evil nor the central avenger part of the movie. Thanks to many flashbacks and secondary story lines the culpability and responsibility of the main actress is though revealed all over the movie and gives us philosophical and introspective insights while the person witnesses a tale of revenge.Second the movie takes its time to introduce all the important characters very slowly. This develops a dark empathy with the main victim that is treated and slowly becomes a monster. The movie creates cruel and gripping personalities and shows us the degree of culpability for all of them. The acting in this intense but slow paced movie is very well done and authentic and it's a very positive and refreshing aspect that the true revenge tale only kicks off after more than the half of the movie has already passed.Third this movie focuses especially on the relationship between the avenger and the person that introduces slowly us to the main story line. It's the first time I see two equally convincing female characters in this kind of tough cruel and highly emotive roles in this kind of genre and they have done such excellent jobs that I'm looking forward to have a closer look at their filmographies.As a fourth very positive point I might finally add that this movie is also intriguing because it takes places on an isolated island and is a huge criticism towards past and contemporary society in South Korea. This movie is much more than just a bloody tale of revenge at first glimpse it's especially a very intense drama with gripping characters.In the end I highly suggest anyone that likes South Korean movies to watch out for this film that has only recently been released in North America. This is another masterpiece of a unique genre coming from a unique country and you won't find this kind of high quality in any cinema or contemporary American blockbuster. South Korea is the best place for original gripping and extreme contemporary movies and this movie underlines the country's unique status and will hopefully inspire our culture to take some inspirations from them without dishonouring their creative pieces of art.".

But I think it's one of the most interesting movies I've ever seen to be frank. I've seen the rural life in India and kinda lived it a bit too and I was kinda really surprised by the similarity that I could find in this movie be it regarding the gender bias or the illiteracy thing or the domestic violence that illiterate women have to tolerate and just live as if they are born to bear that kind of treatment from sadistic husbands.As much as I was amazed from the similarity that I could find I was spellbound by the kind of story telling that this movie was. You would never feel bored although the story goes at a very slow pace although towards the end it gets to your nerves. The acting by every one of them is appreciable as you never feel that they are really just playing the character in the movie. I've been watching Korean movies for a while now and have become a big fan of them since and I certainly think this's one of the best among them. For those who have watched 'Oldboy' or 'I Saw the Devil' you would know what's the kind of gory it would reach. It's truly Korean in every way.If you are a Kmovie fan then you would certainly love this one! This one is going into 'My Collection'!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film of which the international title Bedevilled is a lot easier to remember than the original South Korean one and its director Cheol Soo Jang seemingly appeared out of nowhere but nevertheless left quite an impression at several internationally acclaimed film festivals around the world. Perhaps this is simply because the director is an acolyte of Kim KiDuk or perhaps it's because he actually delivered a unique and hardtocategorize motion picture that spooks through your head long after you finished seeing it. Throughout approximately 75 minutes three quarters of the full running time Bedevilled is a very slow and harrowing drama focusing on the life of one poor woman. Then suddenly almost when you totally don't expect it anymore the film converts into a harsh and downright savage tale of revenge and oppressed anger. The sudden transition is abrupt and shocking but also strangely justified and efficient. One moment you're witnessing the Via Dolorosa of a seemingly timid and vulnerable young woman yet the next moment this timid and vulnerable young woman is coloring the entire island blood red with a primitive sickle. The story opens in modern day Seoul where the egocentric and obnoxious HaeWon is close to reaching an emotional and professional burnout. She goes on a vacation to Moodo the island where she spent her childhood holidays with her friend Kim BokNam. Kim BokNam is very happy to see HaeWon because she thinks her friend has come to save her and her daughter like she begged her to in all those letters. Kim BokNam's life is worse than that of a slave. She's abused and humiliated by her husband and the rest of the island's population both male and female. Another long series of events including the disinterested reaction of her friend slowly lead to a gigantic tragedy. The first three quarters of Bedevilled may come across and dull and eventful  especially when shown at 2am on a Saturday morning in a theater full of horror junkies  but the slow pace and melodramatic atmosphere are fundamental for the film. CheolSoo Jang carefully takes his time to illustrate that Moodo truly is a very isolated setting completely devoid of legislation and social evolution. The elderly intimidate the younger and the men dominate the women probably just like the generations before them did as well. Kim BokNam endured as much anger and agony as humanly possible and this is painfully illustrated in great detail during the film's long awakening. I've rarely seen a cinematic character who's vengeance is so legitimatized and substantiated. My hat's off to debuting director CheolSoo Jang scriptwriter Kwangyoung Choi and lead actress YeongHie Seo. Furthermore Bedevilled benefices from the truly breathtaking island filming locations and staggering photography. Don't know if it's true but I read somewhere that the location was selected out of nearly 3.000 islands surrounding the South Korean shore. The selection was based on size nature and available facilities. Great choice I'd say. Faint hearted viewers beware however as the extended finale features a large number of grim and shocking images.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story starts out with a city girl from Seoul and is rotten to the core and selfcentered in fact a lot of the characters in this movie is like this some more than others. But the main protagonist is a village girl who doesn't know much about modern times and was stuck on a island far from the city areas of Korea called called Moodo. Anyways the main city girl in this is probably the most irritating character to watch in this film especially when the movie comes close to the end she actually portrays how rotten humanity can be. In fact I wouldn't be shocked if it's the majority of people in real life. I personally like these types of movies kinda like Moss where it takes place in a desolated place and there is a mystery behind it. This film has some graphic scenes some even really messed and to that I am not talking about the violence. The villains in this island is basically rednecks of Korea and I really hated them all with a passion. Seeing the village girl who has lived on the miserable island for 30 yrs being mistreated and abused emotionally mentally and physically while being treated as a slave fueled the anger level even more. And was rooting for her to get her revenge. Especially when it came to that one guy who is uber messed up in the head. The grannies old people are known to be uptight but most audiences like me will hate them with a passion. Actually almost the whole village. This really is a compelling story that isn't just all about the violence and the climaxes are well done in this. The main negative aspect is how this movie goes in a pretty predictable direction especially if you seen the trailer. Although it has a few twist than and there. This is a horrorthriller that is interwoven very well when it comes to the end and is worth the time to see it.7.610".

The plot begins when this second girl after some problems in Seoul decides to take a rest and visit the isle.

	schema:reviewBody "After last night MooDo island in South Korea has rocketed to the very top of my 'bad places to live' list though I guess not so much if you're a guy.HaeWon is a beautiful young woman living the city life in Seoul. After a particularly bad day it is 'suggested' that she take some leave to recharge her batteries and regain some perspective. This break sees her leave the mainland for the aforementioned MooDo island  her childhood home  and a place seemingly unchanged since her departure at a young age.Inertia isn't always a good thing but initially this is a boon for HaeWon her trendy haircut high heels and pale skin not darkened by spending countless hours working outdoors make her a minor celeb to the small number of residents still living on the island. While none of this small number are her direct family HaeWon tentatively bonds with BokNam whom she recalls vaguely from her childhood and BokNam's young preteen daughter YeonHee finds HaeWon fascinating having not seen anyone quite like her.Right. Fun's over folks. Be under no delusion. This is NOT a happy film and I have seen nothing like it for a very long time MooDo island is a serene and beautiful locale remote sparsely populated and peaceful. However there remains a distinct caste system that harks back to the dark ages.On MooDo island women inhabit the very bottom rung of the totem pole this is not a nasty secret but essentially common knowledge. They work harder and are given the most thankless tasks are treated with nary a modicum of respect or even common decency and where 'release' is concerned they are expected to be prepared and willing at all times.It seems the women understand that it is what it is especially the older women who no doubt had to deal with it during their younger years but the problem is that with only a single digit population there are only two females who appear to be under 50 BokNam and her daughter.HaeWon knows nothing of this initially and she is bemused but ultimately a little annoyed by the cloying attention of BokNam in the days following her arrival. Gradually though they both come to realise how the other truly lives Unfortunately we the viewers are granted a far clearer and more depressing picture of what BokNam deals with on the day to day to label the local male population as South Korean rednecks might just be a disservice to regular rednecks. In fact I wondered for a while if the only truly apt description might just be the one word I have refrained from using on this site. I might also point out that some of the older women are hardly better examples of humanity one in particular is especially vile and loathsome with her continued verbal beatdowns of BokNam becoming worse by the day.But back to the island of don't ask don't tell. The looming cloud of inevitability closes in on the two childhood friends with BokNam seeing HaeWon as a potential saviour but HaeWon rapidly realising that she might just need to be equally concerned for herself.And as horrible as this all is it gets worse when they go and start implying that the young girl YeonHee is at risk.While I have seen some repugnant and disturbing behaviour on film in my many decades of devouring cinema I can't recall another occasion where I have been so disgusted and bothered by the actions of fictional characters. The equally depressing fact is that this queasiness and unease is a direct result of the plausibility of the film meaning the film is effective and well made. I hardly fluttered an eyelid at the ridiculous crap that plays out in the Hostel films and their ilk. The key to a good revenge film is making sure that there is something worthy of usually violent reprisal. All I can say is that there have been precious few revenge films with reasons as valid and 'worthy' as this one. Might I also say that there haven't been many films where the acts of revenge more than made up for the transgressions. There is a long and deliberate 'sharpening' scene that acts as a prelude to the payoff that is one of bloodiest I can recall yet for a while I actually shared the bloodlust 'Yeah now get that one next!'. At least in principal.But as with every good freakout the danger is that things can go too far and that is indeed the case here near the conclusion of the film let's just say I never thought the phrase 'Put some bean paste on it' could mean something so very extreme.Bedevilled is one of the more legitimately disturbing films that I have ever seen and I am not just referring to the graphic violence. It unfolds gradually and the sheer scope of the situation is allowed to seep into your consciousness before you suddenly become aware that there can only be one way that this film will  no MUST  end. Unlike your Saw films and even more traditional revenge flicks like Death Sentence the violence is less sick than it is sad mainly because in the real world you really hope that there are no places where such subjugation and blatant mistreatment of people exist though the whole while knowing full well that they most certainly do.Final Rating  7.5  10. This film will definitely not make your day enjoyable but it might open your eyes a little to the fact that you haven't got it that bad.".

But from the 2 previous reviews giving a high rating I decided to check it out. I labelled it horror simply cause of the graphic nature of the latter part of the film.But the true horror always lies in human nature and the unkind people around. In the movie there are 2 heroines i say 2 because they survive different ordeals. Haewon is a girl who works in a bank in Seoul. She's the type who never speaks out on anyone's behalf always minding her own business. Her long time friend from the island is Boknam a simple girl who has a daughter and is physically sexually and mentally abused by the very few village people left on the island. The tension builds up slowly the moment Haewon arrives on the island to visit her friend. From there it's a roller coaster ride of emotions.From the first minute to the very last credits it's hard to decide who is the real victim in the whole situation. This film is definitely worth a watch. Not for everyone. Some may find it slow or unbelievable...but perhaps it does reveal some truth in a place so reclusive.".

I don't see the point other than to make us feel badand to catalog the nastiness which makes it a more mature version of torture porn.the film was made by one of the protgs of Kiduk Kim who's films I really like.

Though the plot development may seem for those not tuned into Asian and Korean culture a bit slow in building get ready for a ride that will twist gender roles and mounting vengeance into a landscape well filmed. Acting is nothing less than inspired by all. Location and cinematography well matched to theme.This is a great thought provoking film.

	schema:reviewBody "Here's one of those better Asian shockers. Actually it's quite excellent and bravado film making. But also this movie is truly unsettling for most of the part. It's the heartless if inhuman characters that make it so void of compassion or soul. This is revenge at extremes. A young woman and her little girl are subject to cruelty over decades mostly at the hands of the arsehole husband where I was cheering loudly inside at his demise which was well overdue in light of what I saw before. The husband a bad man like his mates are guilty of many things even interfering with the little daughter. They live off the mainland on this island where even this island itself creeped me out. This whole unsettling scene to be honest was like something out of The Wicker Man. Retreating to this island in light of a rape on the mainland is this young beautiful yet very self centered woman who I must say kind of annoyed me but also intrigued me. She befriends the woman and child but really doesn't really get involved with what's going on. After a physical fracas leads to a tragic incident our long suffering soul turns rabid and with a nearby sickle becomes vigilante and murderess where some quite graphic bloodshed ensues. Be ready for it. I did not feel sorry for any of her victims either. They all deserved to die and I kind of first wanted Miss self centered to die but then I was glad to see some emotion compassion and regret attack her in the final frame. Bedevilled in it's almost two running time duration has you hook line and sinker from the start. When the violence comes it's grand. I really wanted to see this girl send blood spilling on this island folk her supposed family who had me pondering earlier if they were actually cursed or something as they weren't the norm and very bitter and again void of little or no compassion. Daring and disturbing films like this are what really gives highs in movie land though a certain audience will shun away from this heavy film of unrelenting revenge and unstoppable violence.".

The film primarily concerns Boknam the one who stayed back  who faces abuse from her husband to everyone on a daily basis but still endures everything for her daughter whom she cares about most. But when a deadly tragedy occurs she lets out all her anger  frustration that has built over years of abuse to exact revenge on everyone in an extremely violent manner.For a debut effort the director has done a fine job with more rights than wrong the plot is a bit thin  progresses itself through shock value only which is present in abundance in the second half of the film the technical crew also does its job pretty well but it's Seo Younghee who impresses the most as Boknam. She puts up an absolute raw maddening display of miserable life  yet makes the audience feel sympathetic towards her. Next best is Ji Sungwon as Haewon who returns to the island after many years without knowing what devilry awaits her.On an overall scale Bedevilled may suffer from many flaws which are too hard to ignore  mostly relies on its disturbing or violent content to reach out to the fans of its genre but it also shows the beast within all of us that's feeding on anger  frustrations is waiting to be let out  sometimes does in a way that's beyond our control. The film works as an unforgiving thriller to a considerable extent but in its third act turns into a nightmarish horror thanks to a woman gone crazy with a sickle in her hand.

	schema:headline " Hits you like a bucket full of bean paste!";
	schema:reviewBody "Korea is such a standout country for delivering consistently sensational horror films often in the revenge department. Oldboy is nothing short of a masterpiece and I Saw the Devil is one favourite films ever. The Koreans aren't afraid to push the barrier and also never fail to deliver a few large helpings of emotional wallops. They put a lot of effort into writing their characters in order for the audience to invest in the film. Bedevilled is no different.Bedevilled is yet another example of Korean superiority. Thank goodness the loopy Kim JongUn has left South Korea alone because otherwise we wouldn't be getting these incredible pieces of art or Psy! which are important to our society. Bedevilled is a slow burner but it's anything but boring. It takes it time in setting up its two female characters so the audience can care about them even if one of them is a little more than unlikable and thus not care about the slow pace of the film. However I would say that if you're only into some slashing and dashings with thrills and spills then stay clear because Bedevilled delivers something much more than that.I think that Bedevilled is more complex than just a 'revenge movie' and I think too many people dismiss it as just that. To me Bedevilled was about a lonely woman who had been subjected to years of abuse from her husband and lack of support from the few islanders yet always pushed it aside and treated it as nothing until she cracks. I found Bedevilled very psychological and it brilliantly portrays the tragic mental breakdown of an isolated woman who just can't take any more abuse.The build up in Bedevilled is nothing short of brilliant. I loved the way it slowly switched main characters about a quarter of a way through. We initially follow a hardnosed woman working in mainland Seoul who then goes over to a small island where her grandfather used to live to see her friend. Initially we don't really think much of her friend because we've been following HaeWan who is also very selfcentred. However the film slowly allows Kim BokNam the friend to surface and we begin to feel an unbelievable amount of sympathy for her as she's so badly treated by her husband.As I said before the build up is slow but extremely effective. I didn't find it boring in the slightest because it allowed the characters to develop which in turn made the film more and more gripping as it went along. Eventually Bedevilled does explode after some truly shocking and devastating moments but should we really be rooting for Kim BokNam all the way? Bedevilled ends up being incredibly thoughtprovoking as well as exciting and visceral. The final moments pack quite an emotional punch and will have you glued to the screen. I especially liked the match cut which compared HaeWan to the island suggesting a deep inner conflict with herself.Bedevilled is yet another masterful Korean film which manages to tick all the boxes. The actresses also end up being quite exceptional in their respective roles. The film also looks gorgeous in bluray I'd highly recommend it. The cinematography is often breathtaking which adds an usual quality later on as the beautiful backdrop is also used for the scenery of such vile and hideous acts. Bedevilled is well worth your time and money. It reminds you just how amazing foreign films are.".

	onyx:emotionText "Korea is such a standout country for delivering consistently sensational horror films often in the revenge department. Oldboy is nothing short of a masterpiece and I Saw the Devil is one favourite films ever. The Koreans aren't afraid to push the barrier and also never fail to deliver a few large helpings of emotional wallops. They put a lot of effort into writing their characters in order for the audience to invest in the film. Bedevilled is no different.Bedevilled is yet another example of Korean superiority. Thank goodness the loopy Kim JongUn has left South Korea alone because otherwise we wouldn't be getting these incredible pieces of art or Psy! which are important to our society. Bedevilled is a slow burner but it's anything but boring. It takes it time in setting up its two female characters so the audience can care about them even if one of them is a little more than unlikable and thus not care about the slow pace of the film. However I would say that if you're only into some slashing and dashings with thrills and spills then stay clear because Bedevilled delivers something much more than that.I think that Bedevilled is more complex than just a 'revenge movie' and I think too many people dismiss it as just that. To me Bedevilled was about a lonely woman who had been subjected to years of abuse from her husband and lack of support from the few islanders yet always pushed it aside and treated it as nothing until she cracks. I found Bedevilled very psychological and it brilliantly portrays the tragic mental breakdown of an isolated woman who just can't take any more abuse.The build up in Bedevilled is nothing short of brilliant. I loved the way it slowly switched main characters about a quarter of a way through. We initially follow a hardnosed woman working in mainland Seoul who then goes over to a small island where her grandfather used to live to see her friend. Initially we don't really think much of her friend because we've been following HaeWan who is also very selfcentred. However the film slowly allows Kim BokNam the friend to surface and we begin to feel an unbelievable amount of sympathy for her as she's so badly treated by her husband.As I said before the build up is slow but extremely effective. I didn't find it boring in the slightest because it allowed the characters to develop which in turn made the film more and more gripping as it went along. Eventually Bedevilled does explode after some truly shocking and devastating moments but should we really be rooting for Kim BokNam all the way? Bedevilled ends up being incredibly thoughtprovoking as well as exciting and visceral. The final moments pack quite an emotional punch and will have you glued to the screen.

Let me explain this movie is about a problematic city girlHae Won who back to her hometown Doojoo Island to get some rest. She meet her old friend BokNam who want to runaway from the island because she cant stand with what people do to her. BokNam needs her help but she... Help yourself! This movie is moving too fast. Hae Won's character is not welldeveloped  audiences don't get the idea why she behave like that. Also she is not a good actress too.Then the people at the island character looks fake too fiction too dumb see murder for the first time but still can laugh? I don't know what to say they try to make the ending memorable but its bad. I like a robot when I watched this movie because I felt nothing its just a plain brutal movie from Korea. Movie doesn't even need a lot of blood to make it memorable such as The Vanishing 88. I cant help to not hate it its frustrated me. Just like Se7en feel but more blood spilled.".

After having been raped by a stalker she attempts to destroy her unwanted appearance. A policeman who initially protects her is gradually just as crazed by her natural grace as her stalker. And if you wonder why such an obviously traumatized woman is not hospitalized you get to see how a doctor also tries to have his way with the poor girl.This neverending odyssey from one lustful male to the other gives the tragedy an involuntary comical twist and scenes of startling violence interchange with moments of strange humour. That's where this film departs from the gruesomeness of Kim KiDuk's earlier works perhaps due to the influence of firsttime director Jeon Jaehong. As a result I've found it much more entertaining and not quite as paralyzing. Films like Seom The Isle or Hwal The Bow move sordidly through beautiful images to sudden violent thuds. Areumdapta however keeps a steady pace towards a largerthanlife and somewhat farcical finish which makes me wonder  not for the first time  if its creator wants to relate to the female victims of a maledominated society or if he just well gets off on his own twisted fantasies.".

Gosh I'm clever. Let's do it. But he gave it up to somebody else to write the screenplay and direct it.The film begins with scene after annoying scene of a woman being disrespected because she is beautiful. That's not fun to watch. Little girls want her autograph hair stylists want to do her hair for free and of course every man in Korea acts like a complete tool. She is raped and the scene in the police station afterward is as repugnant as one could imagine in a story like this. One cop says things to her like I can see where the rapist is coming from with a body like that who wouldn't want to score it. Another cop a young patrolman treats her with respect and tries to help her. His intentions are good so he'll keep an eye on her and be ready at a moment's notice to rescue her from whatever pops up.He stalks her in scene after annoying scene as she stuffs her face unattractively with junk food trying to make herself fat. She eats too much and throws up and ends up in the hospital. Then she tries to starve herself into looking gaunt. When she passes out in the park the young patrolman runs out from behind a tree with a plate of dumplings. This time it's going to cost you he says. She gets up from the puddle of puke she's been working on and gives him the evil eye. Only kidding he says. Ha ha ha. Then she puts on makeup to look like a bar girl. These are the steps on the ladder of despair she climbs.I kept waiting for some signature Kim Kiduk extreme move to happen like she takes a blowtorch to her face or something. Of course the nice young patrolman turns out to be suspect in his shenanigans. He buys a coffee pot just like the one he saw in her apartment and you know what that means. The rapist starts appearing everywhere she goes in a very ineffectual male JHorrorGothChick sort of way and it drives her crazy. But not crazy enough to do something really Kim Kiduky. Nah. She kills she dies and they continue to disrespect her. I think. I dunno they turned out the lights.Sorry Kim Kiduk fans this is a stupid implausibly written and acted big zero.

Personally I dislike forced happy ends the same as I dislike forced unhappy ones. Generally all in Beautiful seems a little over the top including the final conclusion. Kim Kiduk should begin to concentrate more in giving a genuine message and less in trying to shock us. He has an unquestionable talent but he pays too much attention on the reaction of his public.

	schema:headline " Beauty And Misogyny";
	schema:reviewBody "Beautiful is a South Korean film that stars Cha Sooyeon in the lead role of a beautiful woman named Eunyeong together with Lee Chunhee Choi Myeongsu Kim Minsoo and Lee Min.It was the debut feature of director Juhn Jaihong and it was based on an original story by Kim Ki duk.In the storyEunyoung is a woman who is not happy for her breathtaking beauty. She gets lonely and exhausted from the stares from men and jealousies from women. One day she gets raped by one of her stalkers and hears the terrible words from him. I did it just because you are so beautiful. She believes that she was raped because of her cruel beauty and starts to kill her beautiful looks. Traumatized by her attack Eun young tries to destroy her beauty first by attempting to become obese and when that fails by making herself unattractively thin. When her beauty does start to fade she becomes alarmed and tries to regain it by wearing gaudy make up and revealing clothes her behavior increasingly destructive and unstable. A policeman watches her downfall with pity and sympathy but eventually he too submits to his lustful desires.At some point she says to him that she will be able to live again if she kills the rapist now is in prison so the policeman makes a plan for her to kill him thinking that he is the rapist. After she kills him she doesn't get well and keeps hallucinating of seeing the rapist everywhere. In the end she is killed. However even after she is dead her beauty doesn't leave her and she is once again persecuted by it.Beautiful is a story of a tragedy about a woman who wasn't able to appreciate the gift of her looks.Definitelyit is not a movie for everyone as it is not for made for entertainment but rather it tackles the ugly side of vanity.It talks about how the issue of being beautiful have overtaken human behavior especially in society. Too bad that the story told is implausible and it has taken too much out of context that some viewers may find it both creepy or unintentionally funny  the scenes wherein the admiration of men to a beautiful woman is somewhat completely insane and overthetop.Unfortunatelywhat is not funny is the misogynistic theme in it wherein women taken into account as merely tools for admiration of their beauty rather than being a human being.Too bad that it is not good to perceive men as onedimensional in the sense that their only reason to live in this world is to win the attention of the lovely woman as the screenplay suggests and bad behavior it barely condemns such as stalkingrapinggiving up one's life and having a sexual relations with a lovely but dead corpse  the last scene  which I believe was is the epitome of its misogyny.It is rather disgusting to present that having sexual relations with a dead beautiful woman remains a viable as well as enjoyable moment in life. The film has a promise especially with Cha Sooyeon's brilliant acting.It is just sad that there is much to be desired in its storyline and the subject it wants to tackle intentionally which is beauty without the theme it presents in the movie unintentionally which is misogyny.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think it is probably one of the most disturbing films I have watched since Teeth. I was quite emotionally involved throughout the movie. Teeth is probably presenting many men's nightmare and beautiful is probably an extreme description of men are pigs. I think the main actress would love to have the ability that the girl in teeth has. I try not to give a spoiler but you will understand me when you watch both movies.This is a movie though that I think is better than Teeth in terms of acting. The main actress is indeed a pretty girl but her acting skill is great. To me a lot of actress' break out movie is not because she can act it is because she dares to act. Just to say that she sacrifice a lot to make this movie work. Just like a lot of Asian movie they try to give you an image that you have not think about whole lot but it is in the real life and then they emphasise the image.There are scenes in the movie that I actually think most guys will do that when fantasising their favourite girls and most guys will not think that is a big deal. I recommend them to watch this movie and think about how your favourite girls are violated by those actions if they find out about them.Warning Spoilers below I remember one dialogue from the rapist in the movie making me think about beat him to death Rapist I did not commit the crime I did not rape you. I am the victim here. I am the one got raped. Your beauty raped me. You are the real criminal.The policeman's reply to the main actress is also sick as hell I know he is a sick bastard but it is partly your fault. You pretty girls always go out there with make ups and trying to seduce men by wearing short shirt in the winter time. You are asking for these yourselves.And then he asked her to tell him very details about the rape.sorry about the translation I tried my best to jug my memory. It is pretty much the gist though.  In conclusion it has good acting good directing and good storyline. Recommend for adults not only because the adultery scenes I don't know younger audience will get the idea.".

However without the return of the titular Wife Cha Eunjin Shin EunKyung this movie is nothing more than just a namesake but there's no stopping the linkage with the box office success of the earlier movies. The new Wife here though she's actually a guest rather than a Wife is none other than sultry looking Shu Qi who plays Aryong the daughter of a triad leader what else in Hong Kong starring Ti Lung in a supporting role.There are some bits shot in Hong Kong and in the Cantonese language which is all fine and dandy given it's rare here to hear complete Cantonese dialogue in movies no thanks to the Speak Mandarin campaign but what was bad in these scenes were the plenty of subtitles  in English Mandarin and Korean which cover almost 50 of the screen. As the story goes Aryong offends some gangsters in her homeland and in a bid to ensure her safety her father gets her packing overseas to take cover from the impending gangland war. She gets packed to where else Korea it's a Korean production after all and becomes a guest to some Korean mafiaso with KiChul Lee Beomsu and his posse being the hosts and guardians of Aryong. But with the bumbling inept fools you're quite certain who's the protector and who's in need of protection here.It's a fairly average movie with the usual lost in translation jokes the clashing of cultures and of course societal norms in a male dominated society. Mistaken intentions and deliberate translation errors to pursue individual character ends are the staple here and some of them are genuinely funny but like the adage too much of a good thing cheapens it especially when it continues to milk and replay scenes such as over the dining table. You can see most of the jokes coming your way and it depended very much on the actors' skill in delivery  that exaggerated body language or that wideeyed stare of disbelief and suspicion.The action sequences are nothing much to wow about especially with Shu Qi's superwoman Aryong character who's almost only the character here who can fight. Given the number of goons thrown at her you can't help but feel that many action scenes remind you of The Bride in Kill Bill as she dispatches henchmen with so much ease she rarely breaks into a sweat. And most times with that deliberate long hair obscuring her face you can bet your last dollar it's a stuntman taking over that lithe frame.Some cheap shots were incorporated into the storyline playing to Shu Qi's exvamp slutty image of yesteryears. Guess you can't help it when you have some notoriety in your history and scenes of boob grabs and womanontop staircaseinduced gyrating scenes were in the movie quite unnecessarily if nothing more for some juvenile laughs.But all said it's still a tad enjoyable especially when you can't get tickets into the other blockbuster movies like Transformers and Die Hard 4.0 currently showing. Sometimes movies like this when released at the same time of the expected soldout movies makes its cash by being the catchall net from the expected overflow.".

Although I have nothing against Shin Eun Kyung I feel that the character of a female gangster requires just more than having a scary face. I was very disappointed when I saw Jopog manura and Jopog manura 2. I expected something truly funny with tons of mega kick action but it turned out to be just another clich Korean gangster film. But Jopog manura 3 is totally different from it's predecessors having the right mix of comedyactionand melodrama.although I think that this movie should change it's title given that the movie itself is totally different from it't title.Jopog manura 3 revolves around Ah RyoungQi Shu who is framed of murdering a crime boss from a rival gang to her father's. When her fathera spectacular performance from Lung Ti who starred in the legendary Hong Kong film A Better Tomorrowtells her to evacuate Hong Kong until the heat dies down she chooses to go to South Korea a country where her unknown mother was born. A Korean mob boss who is friendly with Ah Ryoung's father orders his third in charge Ki Chulplayed by Lee Bum Soo star of The City of Violence and Oh Brothersto protect Ah Ryoung during her stay. What started as a mutual relationship between Ki Chul and Ah Ryoung slowly develops into passionate love.If I say more I would be adding spoilers so I'll stop right here. But let me just say again that Jopog Manura 3 was the best movie that I have seen in a long time.".

	schema:reviewBody "In December Big Sister is arriving from Hong Kong.Aryoung is sent away from her homeland of Hong Kong by her father . Her father is a powerful gang leader that is in the midst of a major power struggle. He is worried about the safety of Aryoung and thus gives her the choice to stay in another country until things settle down in Hong Kong. Aryoung picks South Korea mainly because her mother is Korean and now lives somewhere in that country.When Aryoung arrives at the Incheon airport three Korean gang members are there waiting for her. The gangsters were assigned to protect Aryoung by their Korean boss. Unfortunately the three unwitting gangsters were not informed of Aryoung's background nor are they aware that the person the would have take care of is a woman. Aryoung can't speak Korean and the gangsters can't speak Chinese. Thus an uncomfortable acquaintance period is endured until the gangsters hire a Chinese translator. The gangsters soon learn that Aryoung has quite a few more surprises behind her pretty appearance. One of the funniest foreign films that I've seen so far and most probably one of the best Korean films that I've seen but that really isn't something because I haven't seen a lot of Korean films only Taegukgi comes to mind so this easily takes one of the top spots. Take note that I haven't seen the previous two installments so my review of this film is purely a stand alone and not in any way will it be judged and compared to the previous two films. My Wife is a Gangster 3 is a movie that blended comedy and action really well. The comedy are courtesy of the three lovable gangster wannabes who were assigned to protect the Wife portrayed by Shu Qi but it turns out they were the ones that needed protection. The action mostly came from Shu Qi and if you put these characters together you get a hysterical laughoutloud fest that won't stop until it ends. Add to that the blossoming romance subplot involving lead gangster wannabe KiChul and the Wife and you get an impressive Kflick that's worth the watch.".

It is about the daughter of a Chinese gangster who is accused of murdering another gangster! She has to hide in Korea under the protection of a business partner of the father! Other than this fact it has nothing to do with gangsters! Shu Qi is excellent as the main character! She is beautiful and one bad ass chick! So is Lee Beomsu as Ku Chil from City of violence! He is quite the opposite from Shu Qi! The usual jokes about not understanding each other or wrong translation really gets tiresome! The subtle love story is nice and not annoying! There is just enough action to show that Shu Qi is not a girl to mess with! But satisfying it isn't! With the lack of real danger and tension the story is quite boring!

	schema:reviewBody "Some have called this film flawed even the director himself but a flawed film by Herzog is better than most anything you will ever see. The sheer beauty and passion that makes up Herzog's body of work comes shining through in this picture his final with Kinski. One of the things that have always fascinated me about Herzog is that he travels the world to tell his stories rather than staying in one spot namely Germany. Here we get a Brazilian bandit who due to his own meddling is sent to the west coast of Africa to reignite the floundered slave trade. Imagine that a Brazilian bandit played by a 61yearold bleached blond PolishGerman actor. Kinski is in great form as the title character with madness pouring through his teeth at every remark and sneer. He's the villain but yet comes across as a hero by the end but must pay for his sins. The last shot of the film is haunting and chilling. Cobra Verde after being bought out and told that the English have placed a price on his head desperately attempts to escape by pulling a boat into the ocean but cannot move the vessel. And in the background is a polioridden slave slowly encroaching an allegorical reminder of the crippling effect of slavery. No matter how hard he tries Cobra Verde cannot escape his past and it comes back to haunt him. The film also contains great pieces of dialogue. When another slave baron ironically toasts to slavery and calls it the greatest misunderstanding of mankind Cobra Verde replies and says It was no misunderstanding it was a crime. There the character parallels himself against the greatest atrocity of human history Much like slavery Cobra Verde's actions and fates were not through circumstance and fate but rather through his own judgments and actions. He must not suffer through the institution of slavery himself but by his own meddling hands and illgotten gains.In a touching yet sad endpoint the final shot of the film was the last shot of the film and the last moment in cinematic history that Herzog and Kinski worked together again. By this point they had endured each other to the bitter end and parted ways forever. In the commentary by Herzog he notes that despite Kinski's unruly behavior and temperamental decisions he still missed him. He regards Kinski's performance in this film as dirty but yet after viewing the film one cannot imagine any other actor to embrace such a role.Check this film out as soon as you can. Brilliant in every regard.".

Both men had a famously sadomasochistic relationship and in this last effort Kinski was reputedly totally out of control.Cobra Verde marks the breaking point between these two great man. the point where Herzog and Kinski moved too far apart to ever consider working together again the director evolving into too much of a control adept and the leading man moving way beyond the safe boundaries of sanity. Yet the film is an extreme as a result and will divide audiences. But in truth how can this be a negative aspect a film you either love or hate is at least interesting in most cases.The story of bandit Cobra Verde sent to Africa  by his former employer as a punishment for impregnating most of his daughters  to reestablish slave trade and battle an opposing bloodthirsty African tribal king is in itself interesting and unusual enough to arouse interest but barely suffices to convey the numerous delicacies within the film. Kinski's possessed turn may not be an adequate incarnation of the character yet it is a powerhouse performance if only for the sheer energy deployed. And for once Kinski is not the only raving lunatic and Herzog peppers the screenplay with often creepy and dark but hysterical lines and memorable situations and characters. What may disturb many beyond the chaos on show is the casual cruelty on display at times. It is adequate for once. The black man is treated with as much political correctness as must have been the case in real life at the time perhaps even somewhat less. On the other front watching this you actually feel the suffocating heat that slowly burns away the dignity of these characters and makes them animals sometimes far less than that. The film's mood is perfectly rendered and Herzog's visuals are surprisingly artistic and classy at times for a filmmaker preferring a more cinmavrit approach.In the end Cobra Verde is a cinematic oddity because of its taste for extremes though they never hurt the film's own coherence and internal logic in every sense. Nonetheless neither Kinski nor Herzog ever displayed such artistic courage or sheer lunacy at any other point of their respective careers and that's saying something!".

Other parts seem almost operatic  especially the exchanges between Francisco Manoel da Silva Klaus Kinski and the mad African king who has taken da Silva prisoner and plans to kill him. Klaus Kinski is totally compelling in the lead role as Cobra Verde a swashbuckling banditrogue who partly through fate partly through crooked machinations of those around him gets sent off to a Brazilian slave fortress on the coast of West Africa to scout for slaves to bring back to Brazil. I had forgotten how old a man Mr. Kinski was and was curious to find out his age when he made this film. I checked his stats and to my astonishment I discovered that he was 62 years old when he made this film. His performance is truly amazing. Would that I have that much fire and energy when I am 62!I heartily recommend this movie to anyone who is sick and tired of the usual pap that too often fills the screens these days. Though this film was made in 1988 nothing in it seems dated. Just based on its subject matter it already has a builtin timeless quality to it. I think it will hold up well over the years. Go rent it!By the way for those of you who like these sorts of films then another movie that I would recommend as a companion piece to this film is James Ivory's Heat and Dust 1982. Though much more tranquil and sans the fiery acting of a Klaus Kinski in the lead role that film set in India too had excellent cinematography and a compelling historicallybased story with memorable images and characters.".

	schema:headline " A fascinating look at some African cultures.";
	schema:reviewBody "'Cobra Verde' is at times a confusing and awkward story about a bandit who finds himself trapped within the slave trade business. What begins as a story of a feared outlaw turns out to be a story examining African cultures and the issue of slavery itself. What makes this movie more interesting than other American films slavery is that the viewer gets to see the other side of the story the story told from an African viewpoint. International star Klaus Kinski stars a Cobra Verde. He is a feared bandit whom many people fear. When he appears in a small town all the people runs inside their houses because they are scared to death of him. Many things are missing from Cobra Verde's past. How did he become such a feared bandit? The movie does not answer that question. Through a series of odd circumstances he is eventually put into the slavery trade business by a group of rich aristocrats. He is sent to Africa where it is hoped he will be killed because of the slave trade conflicts going on there. What happens is th exact opposite. He gains the trust of the African villagers and eventually trains an army to kill and enemy foe. All the while the viewers are treated to an inside look at some African customs religions superstitions and society. A beautifully made film that is a little marred by changes in the sequences of the story and many things missing from the plot. Nonetheless this film has one of the most memorable and touching death scenes I have ever seen. Bravo to Klaus Kinski.".

The story lacks cohesion many scenes go on for way too long and there is zero character development other than Klaus Kinski. Though it portends to be an epic like Aguirre or Fitzcarraldo it is not even close to the entertainment value of those films. Cobra Verde is little more than a string of exotic visuals.  MERK".

	schema:headline " Epic film Kinsky's last";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Werner Herzog and actor Klaus Kinsky did many films together. They were all spectacular because of Herzogs direction and they all had an intensely insane looking leading man because of Kinskys solid performances. Cobra Verde was their last collaboration together because three years after making this film Kinsky died. He left a great legacy as an actor and Cobra Verde is a prime example of that.The story is about Francisco Manuel aka the Bandit of Cobra Verde a bandit who goes from town to town looking for a strange new world. Basically everyone fears him because he is untamable like a wild beast. One day he gets a job taking care of slaves in a Sugar Cane field and he gets to live in the same house as his boss the owner of the fields. Cobra Verde being the bandit that he is has his way with not one but all three of the bosses daughters and gets them pregnant. The boss looking for a way to get back at Cobra Verde for what he did sends him on a mission to Africa to buy more slaves. Of course the bosses real intentions are to get Cobra Verde killed in the journey. What they don't know is that Cobra Verde is not a person who easily gives up and hes a tough cookie to kill. And so begins Cobra Verdes journey into the hot deadly and colorful depths of Africa.This movie like many of Herzogs films is a journey into the unknown. I love how Herzog does that in all his films. Transporting us to strange places that truly exist but are so wondrous and amazing that they have a surreal dreamlike feel to them. On Fitzcarraldo and Aguirre we went deep into the Amazonian Jungle but on Cobra Verde we get to see the heart and soul of Africa. Once the movie gets to Africa on its second half things get really interesting and you will find yourselves completely immersed in the African culture. From the injustices of slavery to the savagery of African tribes. It was all new strange and different to me because Herzog really went in there and found incredible real life locations in which to shoot Cobra Verde. Its as if Herzog searches out these incredible places dives deep into them and then brings them back to us via his films for us to enjoy. This movie is epic in scale and it shows in every single frame of film. We get hundreds of extras in many scenes. One particular scene stood out and its the one in which Kinsky trains hundreds of African women all dressed in their war attire and marching while singing their war songs. It was fantastic and epic and I loved every second of it. Not only that but its even more amazing when I learned that this huge looking film only cost two million dollars to make! I was unaware that a film of such grand scale could be made with so little money. Hollywood could learn a thing or two from Herzogs style of filmmaking.Klaus Kinsky once again turns in an intense performance as the titular character. He certainly goes in a journey from being a bandit to becoming the king of an African tribe. I really got to like his character because he is a guy who literally does what he wants and has complete freedom over what to do with his life. Nobody tells this guy what to do but once he sets his sites on achieving a goal and its usually something pretty daunting he goes all the way to make it happen.Even when he accepts the responsibilities and challenges involved in going to Africa and taking slaves back to Brazil considering that slavery is almost completely abolished he does it with a sure hand ready to face whatever situations life might hurl at him. And Kinsky does all this with his own brand style that crazy look the wild hair. In one particular scene in which he is training thousands of African women to go to war he goes completely ballistic trying to teach them how to properly handle a shield and a spear. I've got a few complaints though this movie has a few loopholes and unrealistic situations. I think a lot of it has to do with Herzog trying to evoke a feeling of otherworldliness and strangeness but in one particular scene Cobra Verde has to send a message from on place to another and he does it via thousands of people standing in line doing these secret signals with white flags and one person duplicates the message until it reaches the other person hundreds of miles away. This scene might lend itself for a beautiful and strange image but its completely unrealistic! But I was willing to let it go for sake of artistic liberty. Another thing that grated me the wrong way was how one of the African kings spoke perfect English as well as all his followers. The scene would have been a lot more believable with the king having a translator but as it was filmed its hard to believe that a king in the middle of Africa would speak English and much less have all his thousands of followers understand him and cheer him. Again a minor set back in a great film.Like many of Herzogs films the pace is sometimes slow but when Herzog wants to amaze you he will. There will be moments of heavy dialog and slow situations and then Whamo! Herzog will hit you in the head with something truly amazing. Trust me on this this movie has many surprises up its sleeves! And you wont be disappointed if you enjoy movies that take you to strange new worlds.Rating 4 out of 5".

	schema:headline " Last ride of the Aguirres";
	schema:reviewBody "Cobra Verde is the last time Kinski went mad for Herzog. He probably continued to be a raving lunatic to his end but this was the last time something meaningful was siphoned through his madness. Herzog said that after the film was wrapped Kinski was spent he had given all he had to give. Kinski struggled with his delusions of grandeur in his own film Paganini but for all intents and purposes this is the swansong. Strangely and fittingly this is reflected in the character he plays. There's colorful grim adventure in it but at its best Cobra Verde is a coming of age drama.This slavetrader incarnation of Aguirre has matured the waters are stiller and run deeper he's more ambiguous as though the delusions of grandeur have been melted away by advancing age and we're looking at a broken human being who is probably past the point of being able to be made whole again a man who went mad at some point or other but has made his peace with his madness.Here's a man who is a confessed criminal but not a raving monomaniac anymore like Aguirre or Fitzcarraldo now he's the romantic who yearns to cross over to another world. Perfect. Here's closure to a trilogy of sorts about different characters who could very well be the same person in different times.Cobra Verde does that it crosses over to another world it's a glance stolen over the bulwark of a boat off the African coast and through the bushes of the savanna and now we're peering at a small village of huts and cabins and wild black men are dancing a feverish dance around a fire they're waving sticks around them bodies shining with sweat their movements odious and harmonical with some of the spasmodic suspended quality of a coiled spring and then Klaus Kinski has his face painted black by figures with horned headpieces his face is framed by unruly blonde hair so that he looks like a demon figure straight from Japanese mythology  for the black man the devil is white. Cobra Verde is all that it's like an ethnographic document of something that may be even partly fictional yet feels wholy true in its savagery and otherworldliness of something that was lost and now found again it's not Discovery Channel's version of black Africa it's like something straight from the pages of a Joseph Conrad novel a bit sensationalist but also very mystical with traces of something at once horrible and wonderful.We get echoes of Daniel Plainview at the beginning. Cobra Verde is digging for gold in Brazil he's ruthless and vengeful. We enter an empty bar in a small pueblo owned by a midget and we get discussions about lost paradises on earth where the snow is light like feathers. Cobra Verde ambushes a palanquin and a mysterious black girl in a white dress gets out and dances a sensual dance.Now we're on a boat off the African shore looking at a deserted slave fortress through an eyeglass inside the fort a tattered survivor of the black militia of the fort cackles mysteriously and we enter rooms filled with bats and crabs. The movie is very stylized so far when Kinski makes an appearance in the plaza of the pueblo with his poncho and a rifle he looks like he stepped back into a spaghetti western for a shootout. But there are also residues of mystery and nameless rage and violence that seem to come from a different place destruction and abandonment and the first hour of Cobra Verde is among Herzog's finest work because all that is kept just out of sight.The African part of Cobra Verde is less and maybe that is all Cobra Verde does wrong that the mystery is peeled back and we're looking at things too much. We're looking at things too much like we're a visitor in a local tribe and the tribesmen are performing dances and chants for our benefit they wave flags and stage fights they crowd rooms and walk in lines. When the jungle showers down wooden arrows upon Kinski and his group in Aguirre the attackers remain unseen. Here they're rushing out to meet us.It's all a bit like Herzog's tribal docu Woodabe  Herdsmen of the Sun with a Kinski protagonist and a little bit of plot.Another plot line is invoked at the last minute to make order out of the wild something about the brother of the local king one of the most fascinating movie characters of the decade a man who constantly puts on a show for his people he's parts cheeky badass pompous buffoon and stark raving mad wanting to usurp the throne and Cobra Verde leads his insurrectionist amazon army but it's all a bit scattershot. The protagonist has matured but Cobra Verde the movie lacks Aguirre's the singleminded forward pushing sense of a journey into the heart of darkness.Like with most of his movies Herzog saves the best for last  another unforgettable image of a desperate Kinski now the alonest of the alone trying to tug a piroge into the ocean to get away from that godforsaken African shore. A crippled black boy afflicted with polio walks towards him across the shore then pauses and turns. Here's a tragic man alone at his end now an outcast beyond help or reprieve or even vengeance and now he's truly ready to cross over to another world. This is heightened reality it is Herzog's ecstatic truth or in his words sometimes truth comes out clearer out of fabrication.".

Cobra Verde is digging for gold in Brazil he's ruthless and vengeful. We enter an empty bar in a small pueblo owned by a midget and we get discussions about lost paradises on earth where the snow is light like feathers. Cobra Verde ambushes a palanquin and a mysterious black girl in a white dress gets out and dances a sensual dance.Now we're on a boat off the African shore looking at a deserted slave fortress through an eyeglass inside the fort a tattered survivor of the black militia of the fort cackles mysteriously and we enter rooms filled with bats and crabs. The movie is very stylized so far when Kinski makes an appearance in the plaza of the pueblo with his poncho and a rifle he looks like he stepped back into a spaghetti western for a shootout. But there are also residues of mystery and nameless rage and violence that seem to come from a different place destruction and abandonment and the first hour of Cobra Verde is among Herzog's finest work because all that is kept just out of sight.The African part of Cobra Verde is less and maybe that is all Cobra Verde does wrong that the mystery is peeled back and we're looking at things too much. We're looking at things too much like we're a visitor in a local tribe and the tribesmen are performing dances and chants for our benefit they wave flags and stage fights they crowd rooms and walk in lines. When the jungle showers down wooden arrows upon Kinski and his group in Aguirre the attackers remain unseen. Here they're rushing out to meet us.It's all a bit like Herzog's tribal docu Woodabe  Herdsmen of the Sun with a Kinski protagonist and a little bit of plot.Another plot line is invoked at the last minute to make order out of the wild something about the brother of the local king one of the most fascinating movie characters of the decade a man who constantly puts on a show for his people he's parts cheeky badass pompous buffoon and stark raving mad wanting to usurp the throne and Cobra Verde leads his insurrectionist amazon army but it's all a bit scattershot. The protagonist has matured but Cobra Verde the movie lacks Aguirre's the singleminded forward pushing sense of a journey into the heart of darkness.Like with most of his movies Herzog saves the best for last  another unforgettable image of a desperate Kinski now the alonest of the alone trying to tug a piroge into the ocean to get away from that godforsaken African shore. A crippled black boy afflicted with polio walks towards him across the shore then pauses and turns. Here's a tragic man alone at his end now an outcast beyond help or reprieve or even vengeance and now he's truly ready to cross over to another world. This is heightened reality it is Herzog's ecstatic truth or in his words sometimes truth comes out clearer out of fabrication.";

	schema:reviewBody "In the documentary 'My Best Fiend' Herzog says that when directing Kinski in this film he found him 'uncontrollable'.

Then we enter the story proper with an extreme closeup of Kinski's forehead which flows without a cut into a panoramic shot of an arid wasteland dotted with innumerable skeletons of cattle. Herzog's use of landscape in his films is as amazing as ever.Unfortunately after this very promising start the film loses its way. We next see Kinski labouring in a mine apparently to pay the debts on his ranch cheated of his wages he becomes a bandit then he's taken up by a sugar planter because he can control slaves he makes the planter's daughters pregnant and is sent on a suicidal mission to buy slaves from a mad African king. Surprisingly he succeeds and overthrows the king using an army of women but is cheated when Brazil outlaws slavery. He dies attempting to escape to sea once more.As you can see this plot is unremarkable and not really enough for a twohour running time. Too often the film stops for local colour especially in the African sequences when the scenes of local pageantry at the mad king's court seem to go on forever.There isn't really anything we haven't seen in previous HerzogKinski collaborations obsessive dreamer seeks another world which is as flawed as the 'real' world if not more so Kinski seems tired and really can't carry the film alone. By any other standards this is not a bad film but from this partnership it's a bit of a disappointment.".

It may be a faithful adaptation of the novel into big screen but one to make movie based on a book should re wright the story as screenplay within the boundaries of a clich and that's exactly where the movie gets the blow.We see no character development nor any character arc. We never know where the reputation of Cobra Verde came from. Why is he famous. Why people afraid of him. He appears to be hard working labor and shows absolutely no violent behavior throughout the movie actually he appears to be a very reasonable man. When he appears on the city square or whatever it may be called and tells the running slave not to make his situation worse and the slave listens to him it makes no sense at all. When he attacks kings palace and says I was a snake myself in my own country that doesn't make sense either because we saw nothing of his character as a dangerous bandit. When he goes to Africa and things appear to work out immediately again it doesn't make sense if we want to connect the immediate progress to his character. From the dialog we know he must be some sort of though guy but from the action we see a normal somehow arrogant man who has nothing to lose and that's why he is not afraid not because he is brave or a renowned bandit. When in the sugar plantation he says Sugar Planter I'm COBRA VERDE if there was a good character development that had to elicit good amount of excitement among audience which of course it doesn't. Nothing in this movie looks coherent and editing is very poor.It appears that they spent good amount of money and much effort in African tribal scenes which I admire that but again movie failed to create spectacular epic scenes because set ups and costumes were too polished and colorful. Everything looked shiny and brand new and somehow plasticy instead of being dusty less colorful and a bit rundown. The worst was the king's ornament the golden ones. They looked like plastic objects with golden color sprayed on them. I thing herzog assumed that with the quality of theaters in 1987 the resolution is low enough to cover the shininess maybe he could not see the age of HD was coming an assumption which I agree with in great reluctance. Movie filmed in 70mm which was and still considered HD. A movie filmed in 70mm can easily be remastered even as 4K.Seeing so much nudity in the movie one expects so see some harsh sexual scenes which never happens. When at the end of the movie he says I'm the father of sixty something children that appears to be a bitter nonsense.And worse but not worse was the teenager music group at the end which appeared 120 1980s!I like Klaus Kinski a lot and he put good effort into this movie actually I watched the movie just because of him but I guess Herzog director was tired and hasty or let's say he was getting old. Such waste of talent and money can come only from a once brilliant but tired and falling director. I would say the movie is barely watchable but full of obvious defects and it is dead boring.".

	schema:headline " By far the weakest of the HerzogKinski films";
	schema:reviewBody "This review is for Kinski fans only.I don't think this should even be classed as a HerzogKinski film. Kinski is barely in it. Count his lines and you'll see that there are only about 20. The camera rarely shows his face most shots are from behind or far away and in most of his scenes he's just one figure amidst a chaotic jumble of extrasthousands of extras I'm not exaggerating. If I were to clock Kinski's screen time in this 2hr movie it would probably come out to 25 mins.OK the lack of Kinski doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. But in the case of Herzog I believe his art suffers tremendously. HerzogKinski is one of those great partnerships that comes along once in a blue moon. Think Audrey HepburnBilly Wilder. Or Gene WilderMel Brooks. Break up the team and you break up the magic. In COBRA VERDE I think we start to see Herzog's departure from Kinski's powerful drama and instead Herzog chooses to let the African culture and the landscape tell the tale.

	onyx:emotionText "This review is for Kinski fans only.I don't think this should even be classed as a HerzogKinski film. Kinski is barely in it. Count his lines and you'll see that there are only about 20. The camera rarely shows his face most shots are from behind or far away and in most of his scenes he's just one figure amidst a chaotic jumble of extrasthousands of extras I'm not exaggerating. If I were to clock Kinski's screen time in this 2hr movie it would probably come out to 25 mins.OK the lack of Kinski doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. But in the case of Herzog I believe his art suffers tremendously. HerzogKinski is one of those great partnerships that comes along once in a blue moon. Think Audrey HepburnBilly Wilder. Or Gene WilderMel Brooks. Break up the team and you break up the magic. In COBRA VERDE I think we start to see Herzog's departure from Kinski's powerful drama and instead Herzog chooses to let the African culture and the landscape tell the tale.

Their previous collaborations ranged from very good to masterpiece status.'Fitzcarraldo' particularly is what cinema is all about and 'Aguirre Wrath of God' is a groundbreaking achievement. 'Nosferatu' a visually stunning and quite riveting homage to the 1922 FW Murnau masterpiece and 'Woyzeck' very powerful stuff are not quite as good but still great. 'Cobra Verde' is certainly not an awful film and is watchable but Herzog and Kinski's last collaboration is also their weakest to me and it's lesser Herzog overall too.'Cobra Verde' is certainly not without redeeming qualities. The best thing about it is that it's visually stunning there is a sweeping majesty but also a stark but rich atmosphere making for some truly arresting images. The music score is suitably haunting and rousing.Kinski gives his usual intense and effortlessly charismatic performance and there are some wonderfully sensual and surreal parts. Herzog has delivered more on the substance in other films of his but there is a little evidence of that here and there is no denying that he delivers on the style.Sadly the story is the least cohesive and involving of Herzog and Kinski's films together. 'Cobra Verde' is marred by a sluggish pace that is not helped by having scenes that go on for too long and by having storytelling that is chaotic and sometimes incompletefeeling which doesn't make the film so easy to follow. It's not hugely lengthy being under two hours but this is the only film of Herzog and Kinski that feels too long and like the story was nowhere near enough in content to justify the length.Very little is done to make the characters interesting. The titular character is done in a way that's trademark Herzog eccentric character in difficult environment but too much of a pale shadow of far better developed variations of the same type of character in 'Aguirre' and 'Fitzcarraldo'. Some of 'Cobra Verde' also feels excessively overdone thematically and uninspired good ideas for content but with not enough done with it.Dialogue here is the least thoughtprovoking and naturalsounding of their collaborations together often sounding on the awkward side. None of the rest of the performances stand out in any way practically lost amongst the wonderful images but messy storytelling.In conclusion Herzog and Kinski's final and weakest collaboration together. 510 Bethany Cox".

The primary language in here is German and director Werner Herzog and Klaus Kinski collaborated here one final time to make this movie. It is not the first film that takes the two to exotic places obviously. The movie runs for 110 minutes approximately and has Kinski play a man who is in charge of supervising slaves but then he is sent to Africa where he is the only White guy among so so many Black people. Of course the blonde hair slightly gray already by then helps in creating the big contrast in physicality. I cannot say I am familiar with any of the other actors here. Herzog directed of course but he also wrote the script and for that he adapted Bruce Chatwin's novel. While I love Herzog and Like Kinski I must say that this film felt a bit like a poor man's version of some of the other work from the duo such as Fitzcarraldo never been too big on Aguirre. The story dragged on quite a few occasions and I must say that overall I did not feel that this was a really exciting movie. Insanity always played a major role in front of the cameras and certainly also behind the cameras with the volcano that is Klaus Kinski. I would not say that this is a good choice to start getting into Herzog's filmography. I am not at all saying that it was a failure but it just left me hoping for a better movie and it's far from the best Herzog and Kinski have come up with together. But why would you want to start with this one as it's also a fairly later career effort from Kinski and he was already 60 here. Only 3 Italien films should follow until his death less than five years later. I guess he was probably past peak already for this one too. I don't recommend the watch. Thumbs down.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anyone who is thinking of watching Anna And The King Of Siam thinking he will just see The King And I without the RodgersHammerstein music is in for quite a surprise. Quite a bit had to be toned down from this dramatic version in order to make it more lighthearted and good subject matter for a musical.I can't believe the number of folks who miss the point of Anna And The King Of Siam in just dismissing it as typical western racism. Yes it's there but the real story of Siam later Thailand is how it missed being colonized by the west. In that regard the story is like Japan.King Mongkut who ruled from 1851 to 1868 and played by Rex Harrison in his first role in a Hollywood film was a man who's sole ambition was to keep his country away from colonial hands. But he also knew that the west had far outstripped the east in material progress if not culturally. His challenge was to learn from the west without being taken over by them. Toward that end he did import among other things Anna Leonowens shortened to Owens in this film and played by Irene Dunne. Her job was to educate the royal children most especially the Crown Prince Chulalongkorn who would rule Siam as Mongkut's successor. How much and what kind of personal relationship she developed with the King is part true and part from the fertile mind of Margaret Landon who wrote the book this and The King and I were based on.Today when you visit Thailand they will tell you up front about how proud they are that they were never colonized by a western power a singular achievement in the 19th century. They did give up chunks of territory to the French in IndoChina to the British in Burma and Malaya but Siam was kept in being. Ironically enough when it was conquered it was by another Eastern power Japan in World War II. Thailand most people forget because of that was an Axis power nation quite unwillingly but they had little choice in yielding to a nation that learned the lessons Mongkut and Chulalongkorn learned far better.Giving good performances in the supporting cast are Linda Darnell Lee J. Cobb and Gale Sondergaard. Darnell's character as Tuptim current favorite of the king has far more bite to it and she's not a nice girl who the western schoolteacher is trying to help on the path to true love. Cobb's role as the chief minister the Kralahome is far more expanded in this than The King And I. And Gale Sondergaard as Lady Thiang mother of the crown prince is touching as the mother who really does live for her son as she's got nothing else really in the world. She was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in 1946 but lost to Anne Baxter in The Razor's Edge.It's also ironic that while any number of folks might decry the racism shown by whites in Anna And The King Of Siam at the same time they're also revolted by the position of women in Siam being not above household furniture. Irene Dunne's character is hardly a Victorian feminist but just the contrast to the other females in the cast forces here to become one. But that was their culture and still is in many areas of modern Thailand. The highly acclaimed remake of this story that starred Jodie Foster and Chow Yun Fat in 1999 tells far more of the real story. It's good to compare the two. The differences in both versions tell a lot more about us as a society than even about 19th century Siam.".

	onyx:emotionText "Anyone who is thinking of watching Anna And The King Of Siam thinking he will just see The King And I without the RodgersHammerstein music is in for quite a surprise. Quite a bit had to be toned down from this dramatic version in order to make it more lighthearted and good subject matter for a musical.I can't believe the number of folks who miss the point of Anna And The King Of Siam in just dismissing it as typical western racism. Yes it's there but the real story of Siam later Thailand is how it missed being colonized by the west. In that regard the story is like Japan.King Mongkut who ruled from 1851 to 1868 and played by Rex Harrison in his first role in a Hollywood film was a man who's sole ambition was to keep his country away from colonial hands. But he also knew that the west had far outstripped the east in material progress if not culturally. His challenge was to learn from the west without being taken over by them. Toward that end he did import among other things Anna Leonowens shortened to Owens in this film and played by Irene Dunne. Her job was to educate the royal children most especially the Crown Prince Chulalongkorn who would rule Siam as Mongkut's successor. How much and what kind of personal relationship she developed with the King is part true and part from the fertile mind of Margaret Landon who wrote the book this and The King and I were based on.Today when you visit Thailand they will tell you up front about how proud they are that they were never colonized by a western power a singular achievement in the 19th century. They did give up chunks of territory to the French in IndoChina to the British in Burma and Malaya but Siam was kept in being. Ironically enough when it was conquered it was by another Eastern power Japan in World War II. Thailand most people forget because of that was an Axis power nation quite unwillingly but they had little choice in yielding to a nation that learned the lessons Mongkut and Chulalongkorn learned far better.Giving good performances in the supporting cast are Linda Darnell Lee J. Cobb and Gale Sondergaard. Darnell's character as Tuptim current favorite of the king has far more bite to it and she's not a nice girl who the western schoolteacher is trying to help on the path to true love. Cobb's role as the chief minister the Kralahome is far more expanded in this than The King And I.

Cobb! et al are quite good.There's been much ado about comparing this movie with THE KING AND I. Margaret Langdon did not write a musical about her experiences there she wrote a book. Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote the musical based on the book. The two are certainly two different entities and should be based on their singular merits and faults. It's about as silly as trying to link REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE and GREASE!Yes Anna's character is a tad dowdy if not prudish yet these are values from the 1860's not Woodstock in the 1960's. It's really not fair to judge the characters motivations by our present standards or perceptions of morality. True it would have been better to cast an Asian actor as Mongkut yet these were not the realities of 1940's Hollywood and we well know this.Overall we watch cinema to be entertained and escape and ANNA AND THE KING OF SIAM provide more than ample reward for the viewer in that regard.".

	schema:reviewBody "Summary BETTER than the King and I   This has always been my favorite version of this story.  Why? Not just because it was done first 1946 that is before the  King and I Play1951 Film1956 does it make it better. Not because  the original story was a drama rather a lively Broadway musical. Not  even because the story was written by a woman about a woman and not  about a man as was shifted later by Brynner.   The performances by Irene Dunne Rex Harrison the production values  the direction are all done at such a fine intimate level. The true  nuance of the hardship that Anna went through in her dealings with this  imperial king is felt throughout. The musical never depicts this which  such finelywrought detail and care.   With our 21st century sensibilities we might think that there is  something goofy about Rex's performance. Does anyone really know what  life was in 19th Century Siam? I believe this even after reading about  the difficulty Harrison had with the depiction of this role. There is  nothing Charlie Chanish about this performance. The strictness and  order of the Asian mindset does create a cultural chasm at times for us  in the West. The Asian languages are structured differently than our  Western languages. The use of articles is almost nonexistent  therefore the sometimes stilted manner of vocal delivery may sound  staccato. The Asian vocal chords are sometimes different from Western  vocal chords. There exists a predominance of higher pitched voices. And  so what of it? Was the King and I more real than this movie? The only  thing that can be said about Brynner is that he is physically more  imposing than Harrison and Brynner has a rather slight Mongolian aspect  to him which brings more authenticity to his appearance.  Finally and besides my objections above ANNA AND THE KING OF SIAM is  movie full of heart and compassion. Each turn of events is handled with  care and not given a Hollywood finish and sheen. ANNA is recommended  hands down.  The finale though some jaded observers would dismiss as formulaic is  indeed a grand and quiet moment not to be missed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I lived in Thailand for a couple of years and had visited many long summers before that so this movie was of interest to me. I had read quite a bit about Anna Leonowens and her stint as teacher of King Mongkut's children including Prince Chulalongkorn who eventually became Thailand's greatest king. It is true that Anna was a teacher of the royal children but the idea that she had any influence over the king is preposterous and that is the conclusion of British historians. I should also point out that while the history of Anna is highly fictionalized some of the history of Siam as represented here is somewhat accurate. Although many of the events pictured here are totally fictitious at least this version of the story as compared to the musical seems somewhat more believable. There are some things I found a bit difficult to swallow  like that the King would not know how to eat soup. The Thais have several wonderful soups but perhaps they came to be after this period I don't know. And although I don't know what the habits were back then Thais don't usually use chopsticks. The real problem here from the point of view of the Thais is that particularly during the first half of the film Anna is so condescending to the King. Think about it  commoner versus King in any country.Knowing that in advance I was interested in seeing how realistic the film was in other matters and to my surprise I have to give it fairly high marks. While I am not fluent in Thai I speak a little and I easily recognized many phrases that were spoken relatively accurately. The representations of exterior and interior architecture are reasonably realistic with an occasional exception. The representation of the exteriors of the Grand Palace and Wat Phra Keow the royal temple are quite good. Art work is rather authentic...for example as related to the Thai Ramakien.Of course King Mongkut would never have acted the way Rex Harrison acts here although Mongkut was a rather unattractive man and something about Harrison's face does remind me of Mongkut. Early on there is a mention of sin a concept that is not really recognized in Thailand. It's too bad more of the Siamese in the film were not at least Asian.I was particularly interested in Anna's reaction to the first house she was offered. Even today if she saw how many poor Thais live she would be appalled at the conditions. Clearly considering the era she was expecting far too much.In terms of acting this film is extremely well done. Irene Dunne as Anna is superb. Yes we know many of these things didn't happen but Dunne makes them seem reasonable. Rex Harrison is excellent as the King. Again we know the King wouldn't have behaved in those ways but nevertheless it's a very good performance and I believe it was Harrison's first in an American film.Two actors that usually don't impress me were quite good here. Lee J. Cobb seems an odd choice to play the King's closest adviser but he does it very well and his spoken Thai was wellcoached. And Gale Sondergaard who all too often played villainous women is quite good here as one of King Mongkut's wives and the mother of Prince Chulalongkorn.The latter portions of the film are interesting. One tragedy  Anna's son dies. Which he did not in real life and the company he founded can still be seen in Bangkok. And one last inaccuracy King Mongkut died from malaria contracted when he went upcountry to view a total eclipse astronomy was a passion Prince Chulalongkorn also contracted malaria on the trip and nearly died himself...which is not at all depicted in the film. On the other hand long after Anna left Siam the real King Chulalongkorn traveled to Europe and really did visit Anna. So obviously there was a real teacherstudent relationship of respect between the two.The film is so well done that I'd be tempted to give it a rare 8 rating but due to the historical inadequacies I'll give it a 7.I should mention the documentary about the real Anna Leonowens on the 20th Century Fox DVD of the film. It's too pro the story of Anna. A number of British historians have debunked much of Anna's story but this documentary interviews her relatives...hardly unbiased. Other parts of it are realistic particularly her fabrication of her early life. Take it with a grain of salt but it's an interesting documentary.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film because I'm such a fan of Irene Dunne particularly in her lighthearted romantic and screwball comedies. There are some amusing situations but this is ultimately a drama and certainly not a lavish musical. It still to me is the best version of them all.This film hits hard right out of the gate with Anna and her son caught in a situation that neither quite expect. Rex Harrison plays the King surprisingly well despite not looking as exotic as Yul Brenner or as truly authentic as YunFat Chow. Dunne's determination and caring for her son spur her on and make her brave and strong in an understated fashion as the film progresses. The main characters repartee is a delight to witness. Their chemistry is just right and they do not have the luxury of lavish musical numbers to draw them together. One just knows they have a great respect for each other from very fine acting. I will say that I found this version the most emotionally charged of the three motion pictures yet it is not a Peyton Place melodrama. Maybe that's why I love it so. It's so wellmade in every aspect that it really packs that emotional punch for me. I didn't even recognize the usually very recognizable Lee J. Cobb and somehow missed his name in the credits the first time. I think this is about as fine an epic drama about forbidden romance and opposing cultures as I've seen. I give most of that credit to the wonderful performances of the leads and the incredibly adept script. It entertains tugs at your heartstrings and doesn't disappoint. I highly recommend it as the best version of them all".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the memoirs of Anna Leonowens an English woman that went to Siam as a teacher to the royal family of the then King Mongkut gave way to Margaret Landon's novel that served as the setting for the 1946 Twentieth Century production. It was 1862 when the action occurs. The kingdom of Siam is breaking from its splendor into what became the modern Thailand. It must have been a quite a cultural shock for an educated woman facing an exotic land she knew nothing about.The original film was directed by John Cromwell who gave the material a lavish treatment. Talbot Jennings and Sally Benson adapted Ms. Landon's book into a film that even by today's standards can stand against the other versions of the novel. Of course the Rogers and Hammerstein's musical The King and I was a glossy account of what had been achieved in a film with less. Who can forget Yul Brynner in the role? Comparisons do not take into account what was achieved by Mr. Cromwell.Irene Dunne was always a reliable actress that gave excellent portrayals of whatever she was asked to play. It is a pleasure watching her in the role of the woman that had the resolute spirit to stand for what she believed even if she had to speak her mind to a king. Rex Harrison's king while not as strong still shows an actor that knew how to convince us he was that strange individual cruel as well as generous. The combination of Ms. Dunne and Mr. Harrison paid off well.The great Lee J. Cobb shows up in a supporting role. We had trouble placing him with the dark looks he was given for his part. Linda Darnell is Lady Tuptim the girl that goes from being a favorite to being rejected by the king. Gale Sondergaard appears as the disgraced wife that only wants to have the crown prince learn from Anna.The cinematography is by Arthur Miller who produced vivid images of a phony Siam appear real. Bernard Hermann's musical score works well in the picture. John Cromwell directed with style and got excellent results from the large cast. See the film for what it is and do not compare it with what came out later. This was the original!".

And as others have said they are two different things each with their own merits.What I enjoyed most about this very fine movie was the particularly fine performance of Irene Dunne. I've seen her in other movies where she delivers a nuanced and understated performance which is true of this movie as well and in spades. There are times when just watching how she plays various emotions across her face is fascinating by itself. Other times she lets us see hints of emotions that her character then suppresses. Harrison is good as the King though he plays him with broader strokes as the script calls him to do. Anna is a complex individual however and Dunne does full justice to all its complexity.I just watched this movie again tonight and I was struck again by Dunne's fine understated performance but also by the intelligence of the script and the pacing. The main characters are all threedimensional in an era when it would have been easy to do caricatures of the Siamese characters. Things move along at an unhurried pace but it is never too slow. It's really one very fine movie.And now I've watched it yet again on TCM and my admiration for this movie only grows. I still stick by everything I've written in the past. Another thing that struck me on this latest watching was the very intelligent discussion of the importance of the rule of law. I have no idea if that exists in the book on which this movie was based. But this movie makes repeated and intelligent argument emphasizing that arbitrary rule by personal whim is not acceptable in the modern world. It must have struck particular chords in the immediate postWorld War II world into which it was released.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anna and the King of Siam 1946 is the first big screen adaptation to borrow from the personal journals and public account of British school teacher Anna Leonowens and her experiences in the far East. After the death of her beloved husband Anna Irene Dunne departed England in 1862 with her young son in tow to become the educator of the King of Siam's many children. However upon arrival Anna discovers that King Mongkut Rex Harrison is very much a renaissance man trapped in heritage thinking. He refuses to acknowledge Anna's request for a house expects that she will bow and grovel as his servant and demands above all else that the protocol of suppliant be strictly observed. The headstrong Anna of course disagrees. And although their initial meeting is marred by a considerable clash of wills eventually the two begin to recognize a genuine affection and respect for one another. He in marvel of her forthright nature in the face of his wielding totalitarianism realizes his way may not always be right. She in absence of having a man to love discovers a fallible side beneath the king's rather gruff faade. Together these two launch a formidable quest to bring western culture and change to the seemingly backward status of Siam. However the revolution will neither be easy nor straight forward.Director John Cromwell does his very best to ensure an integrity in what are essentially cardboard caricatures of people who perhaps defy any threedimensional understanding. In point of fact Anna Leonowens probably overestimated her influence on the country and its monarch in her journals. Hence the whole tale is thrown off balance by a very traditionalist and imperialist perspective that reduces Mongkut to parody from the start. As a Siamese king Rex Harrison is hardly ideally cast  yet he manages to make much of the shortcoming transforming what might otherwise have been a very dismal characterization into a challenging bit of reflection. Irene Dunne is an effervescent Anna  though in her one sees perhaps too much of the screwball heiress a la Cary Grant in The Awful Truth and less of the stalwart schoolmarm that was in fact the real Anna Leonowens.Fox's Studio Line transfer on Anna and The King of Siam is impressive if flawed. Though dirt scratches and grain are kept to a bare minimum there are still occasions riddled throughout where the gray scale falters. Blacks are sometimes black sometimes deep gray. Whites can be clean but most often appear slightly speckled. Contrast levels vary throughout. There's some speculation as to whether dupe negatives were used for certain scenes. There is a genuine loss of fine details in certain scenes. The audio is mono but nicely balanced. The only extras are an audio commentary and a Biography Special on the real Anna Leonowens.".

The production values music and Yul Brynner are especially good.'Anna and the King of Siam' a somewhat truer and more realistic account of the story is still a very good film though if just lacking 'The King and I's energy' and occasionally taking itself too seriously. Richard Lyon is a bit bland as Anna's son. Criticisms of 'Anna and the King of Siam' actually for me are few and are not that major only being occasional problems.It is especially good for the acting. Irene Dunne was born for Anna portraying the role with touching sincerity and dignity. Her chemistry with Rex Harrison has a believable amount of tension and grows convincingly. Harrison on paper seemed a major miscast and occasionally he overdoes it in some of his mannerisms which are reminiscent of something like Charlie Chan but actually on the whole it is performance of great authority and complexity.They are supported by a supporting cast that are more than up to their level. Gale Sondergaard gives a very moving performance and Lee J. Cobb is commanding in the more expanded role of the Kralahome. Linda Darnell gives Tuptin spunk and emotion never falling into passiveness.Visually 'Anna and the King of Siam' is pretty exquisite with Arthur Miller's marvellous cinematography and the lavish and evocative sets deservedly winning Oscars. Bernard Hermann's music score is a good fit and a strong score in its own right if not iconic status like 'Psycho' or 'Vertigo'.Scripting is literate and provokes thought while the story is sensitively and movingly told with the conflict very convincing. John Cronwell's direction apart from the odd lack of liveliness is solid.Overall a very good film especially for the acting. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is based on a book by Margaret Landon in 1944. Anna and the King of Siam was a bestselling novel based on a true story. The story is much more interesting and intriguing than the movie can portray. And the true story within the story is more fascinating yet. So how much of the movie is fact and how much fiction? First the film and then the background. The main characters are real and played well. I don't hold with those who argue that a person of one race can't play a role of another race. That's part of what theater and acting are about. Sure it's nice and best if one can find the talent and qualified actors to play various ethnic roles. But it's not necessary. And I don't nitpick actors who don't look a part or who's accents aren't perfect  unless they are quite terrible to the point of distraction.Rex Harrison does an excellent job as Mongkut the king Siam. Lee J. Cobb is very good as Kralahome his prime minister. He is probably the least believable as Siamese and that's because his distinct voice build and persona are so well known. But his acting and broken English as one might expect of a Siamese are very good. Gale Sondergaard is so good in her role as Lady Thiang that she looks and sounds Siamese. Linda Darnell is almost as convincing as Tuptim.Now the background. Margaret Landon was an American missionary who served with her husband in Siam from 19271937. She taught here three children along with Siamese in a mission school in Trang. She studied and read all about the country. She learned about Anna Leonowens who had been a governess to the Siamese royal family in the 19th century. After Landon's family returned to the U.S. in 1937 she wrote the book about Anna. It was a bestseller in 1944 and 20th Century Fox made this movie in 1946. A decade later her book also would become the source for the Fox musical The King and I. But how much of the book is true? And how much is the film true to the book and the real life story? I didn't read the book so I can't comment on it. Another book about Anna came out in 2008 that gave a somewhat different background. Bombay Anna was written by Susan Morgan. It claims to tell the real story and the remarkable adventures of the 'King and I' governess. A New York Times review of that book on Oct. 20 2008 called Anna Leonowens a con woman. On disembarking in Singapore as a young widow in 1859 this gifted con woman subtracted three years from her age relocated her birthplace from Bombay to Wales forgot her mother's Indian parentage promoted her father from private to major and changed her husband from a clerk to an army officer. Leonowens was educated and knew languages  Hindi Marathi Persian and Sanskrit and she could mimic a genteel English accent. She was AngloIndian and born Nov 6 1831 in India. In 1849 she married an Irish clerk Thomas Leon Owens. The two surnames later were merged. The couple spent several years in Australia where a daughter and son were born. First was Avis in 1854 and then Louis in 1856. In 1859 Thomas died of a stroke in Malaysia where he managed a hotel. Then Anna moved with here children to Singapore where she revised her background to fit in among the expatriate British colony there.King Mongkut of Siam was born in 1804. He became a Buddhist monk and read and studied much. He helped establish a monastery that became the intellectual center of Siam. Mongkut became king in 1851 and reigned until his death in 1868. In 1861 he asked his agent in Singapore to find an English governess for his children. Leonowens got the job and arrived in Bangkok in 1862. She sent daughter Avis to England to school and taught Thomas along with the royal household. She later sent Thomas to England to finish his schooling and after five years she left Siam for the United Sates. She later moved to Montreal Canada to be near her daughter and she died there in 1915 at age 84.So how much of the movie is true to history? Well Anna didn't stay into old age when the king died. He was older than she and he died in 1868. In the U.S. she wrote her memoirs and was successful as a teacher and traveling on the lecture circuit. Her son Louis did not die from an accident in Siam. Mongkut did write to a U.S. president and offer elephants. But it wasn't Abraham Lincoln it was James Buchanan 18571861 and it was before Anna arrived in Bangkok. Mongkut was a progressive leader who ensured liberal education for his sons. After his death they began many of his reforms. There is much more about Siam Mongkut Anna and others that room doesn't allow to tell here.In one scene Mongkut has summoned Anna in the middle of the night. He questions the Bible story of creation. Anna says Your majesty the Bible was not written by men of science. It was written by men of faith. It was their explanation of the miracle of creation which is just as great a miracle whether it took six days or many centuries. I think science does not contradict the Bible. It has only made us more aware of how great the miracle was.".

While Dunne is a fine actress she seems too warped into the melodramatic while missing the lightness of the character and of the relationship she shares with the king. She has moments where she is quite close to having her down but she holds herself back. The problems with the film are not major and it is quite lovely to look at. Sumptuous sets and exceptional photography carry us through though director Cromwell suffered from the same problems as Dunne the film lacked a sense of fun and light heartedness.

	schema:reviewBody "Anna Owens and King Mongkut were real people this is basically a true story.  Both this film the play on which it was based and the fabulous musical The King And I haven't seen the new cartoon version are very similar versions of the same story.  They suffer from some of the same flaws  White men in yellowface as the king a weak story always a danger with reality and an unmitigated dose of racist colonial arrogance but in The King and I the flaws are mitigated by fabulous performances and some terrific musical numbers.The biggest problem with this film is Rex Harrison's performance as King Mongkut.  He's a wonderful actor and tries very hard to put feeling into the role but he trips himself up with a lot of dreadful Charlie Chan mannerisms.  You can read the story of how he came to give such a bad performace in the entertaining autobiography of his second wife out of 6 Lili Palmer Change Lobsters and Dance.  This was his first Hollywood film when he was offered a role in a major film he had jumped at the chance.  He hoped for a career breakthrough that would make him an international star not just an English leading man.  So he accepted the rather improbable casting and sailed for America.  When he got there and the starting date got closer and closer he realized to his horror that he had absolutely no idea of what to do with the part.  Worse neither did the director he had been counting on Harrison.  AS the start date approached Harrison was truly truly desperate and willing to take advice from any corner and of any quality.  When his Elsa Schreiber wife's German drama teacher gave him suggestions like using a voice that's ...staccato and highpitched a bit like birds twittering.' and a laugh almost inaudible and convulsive'.   He seems to have taken her advice to the letter from a woman who knew no more about Thailand than he did.The other thing that I can't stand about this film is that when you see this story played straight no song and dance you get a painfully large dose of British colonial arrogance and racism.  The British Empire was at its peak then and wanted to annex Siam Thailand.  Mongkut was desperate to avoid this fate and tried to modernize his country in selfdefense Mrs. Owens being part of the program.  She was brought in to give the king's children a modern education and became an adviser to the King himself.  There's something sad about watching this grade school teacher meddling in the affairs of nations.  Even if she is a likeable and sensible woman she never rises above her time and class she shares a bit of the King's enemies arrogance.  It's even sadder that her advice was needed it's made painfully clear that the men who ran the British Empire and threatened Siam wouldn't dream of treating the intellegent monarch of an ancient kingdom as anything but a grubby little native unless he knew which fork to use.Other than those two huge flaws it's not a bad movie it's regarded as a classic by some.   Irene Dunne gives a charming performance as always and the supporting players are all more convincing than Harrison even all the other white folks.  The photography is effective there is much more of a sense of The Mysterious East than in the later version it actually seems hot exotic and foreign.But the Yul Brynner version of The King and I is an infinitely better way to waste two hours haven't seen the cartoon.  Yul Brynner isn't any more Asiatic than Harrison but he's so utterly fabulous that who cares.  He deserved the oscar he got I've never seen an actor be more imperious physical and just plain sexy oooohh.  And fun and exotic and thrillingly butch.  The musical numbers are enchanting and serve to cover a lot of weaknesses in the plot and dilute the racist arrogance that's still there.  Dunne is charming in this film but Deborah Kerr is even more so.So basically The King and I is grand fun while this version is more of a melodrama with much more obvious flaws.  I look forward to the Jodie FosterChow Yun Fat remake.  A nineties version might explore some of the racial and cultural issues that the makers of this film ignored.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the very start we follow this story of civilization's collision of traditions from the point of view of a visiting English widow. From the very first scene she is significantly stunned and incensed at the feudal mores of Siam when she disembarks there in 1862 to educate the king's clan of children and mulishly declines to grovel before him and proceeds to spend several years in hotcold teetering with him. This is actually a moving and ultimately very poignant story not because of its interest in the discord between the Imperialist Victorian ideology with the autocratic regime of Siam's King though it does produce a handful of interesting even funny scenes. It's because of the interpersonal attachments deteriorations and healing of wounds by the extraordinarily moving triage of performances by Irene Dunne Rex Harrison and Lee J. Cobb.Something we face when watching old movies is the reflection of ideas and attitudes of a time in our history not very far back at all. And some of these reflections are more socially or institutionally offensive than others some not at all some charming. Anna and the King of Siam is a matter of judging datedness against dramatic effectiveness cultural attitudes against a screenplay based on personal accounts mainly beautiful performances against crude exclusionary portrayals of Asians by actors in yellowface.Rex Harrison and Lee J. Cobb are given artificially slanted features and deep synthetic tans with makeup as the king of Siam and his deeply loyal and deferential Prime Minister. To modern eyes this is immediately a difficult thing to accept. But the effectiveness of their characterizations I attribute as a testament to the performances of those two actors in the face of how difficult it is to accept the mobconnected union boss on the Waterfront in a turban and no pants. And yet by the end they have made us forget about them as white movie stars and genuinely begin to sympathize with them acutely as two men of castiron codes of values that nevertheless their humanity will always challenge.It's difficult to judge the movie's cultural attitudes against the true elements of the story without reaching outside of the movie itself what's on the screen. In terms of the four sides of the screen while Anna and the King of Siam plays on it I see a much more immediate issue with judging the movie's theatrical datedness against its dramatic effectiveness. And either way it is indeed dramatically effective. This sort of subjective experience is what makes old movies important to preserve They're going to keep on meaning different things to different people till the end of time.Now if I'll get to the point the reason for this film's surprisingly intense poignancy is as I say moving characterizations by three great performers. One of them is in every single scene and that's Irene Dunne playing Anna the governess from England who brings her son with her. One of the most palpable touching things of all I've ever seen this amazing actress do is after building a character whose castiron code of morality and decorum matches both said Siamese white men combined revealing not merely a maternal instinct but a maternal need. There comes a point in the story where her need for a son must be supplanted. She and the young boy in the scene are so tender together only a lack of a pulse could prevent tears.Dunne as sublimely classy as she ever was holds her bonneted head high displays sharpness with attractive reserve and ultimately releases sore poignant tears. Her lady is on a plain with some that Greer Garson has played. The dignified and glorious woman an everadmired character in cinema and invariably a specific preference for admirers of Irene Dunne is paid tribute in the customary luxurious way but not without a raw bone of excruciating humanity and an enormously dramatic transformative arc.".

	onyx:emotionText "From the very start we follow this story of civilization's collision of traditions from the point of view of a visiting English widow. From the very first scene she is significantly stunned and incensed at the feudal mores of Siam when she disembarks there in 1862 to educate the king's clan of children and mulishly declines to grovel before him and proceeds to spend several years in hotcold teetering with him. This is actually a moving and ultimately very poignant story not because of its interest in the discord between the Imperialist Victorian ideology with the autocratic regime of Siam's King though it does produce a handful of interesting even funny scenes. It's because of the interpersonal attachments deteriorations and healing of wounds by the extraordinarily moving triage of performances by Irene Dunne Rex Harrison and Lee J. Cobb.Something we face when watching old movies is the reflection of ideas and attitudes of a time in our history not very far back at all. And some of these reflections are more socially or institutionally offensive than others some not at all some charming. Anna and the King of Siam is a matter of judging datedness against dramatic effectiveness cultural attitudes against a screenplay based on personal accounts mainly beautiful performances against crude exclusionary portrayals of Asians by actors in yellowface.Rex Harrison and Lee J. Cobb are given artificially slanted features and deep synthetic tans with makeup as the king of Siam and his deeply loyal and deferential Prime Minister. To modern eyes this is immediately a difficult thing to accept. But the effectiveness of their characterizations I attribute as a testament to the performances of those two actors in the face of how difficult it is to accept the mobconnected union boss on the Waterfront in a turban and no pants.

Cobb as the Prime Minister to the King who stands out so I am not sure why Gale Sondergaard Tip Tem was nominated for an Oscar rather than he. The production design and photography is excellent and fully deserves the Oscar awards. There is the usual Americanisation of a British story thus devaluing its quality. Irene Dunn is an American actress playing an English rose she tries hard but she is not Deborah Kerr and her son is totally American no vestige of an English accent at all! What also spoils the believability of the story which is loosely based upon exaggerated fact is English porcelain clearly spelling Honour as Honor! Also the King's obsession with the American Civil war and Abraham Lincoln is baffling when you consider that this story is set in a time when the divided American States were engrossed fighting amongst themselves whilst Great Britain was the most powerful nation on earth and the British Empire at its height.

However the generous use of artistic license can be almost completely forgiven because the final product is so pleasing.  Director Andy Tennant weaves together resplendent visual images wonderfully warm lighting magnificent set design breathtaking locations and beautiful costumes to produce a banquet of sensory delight.  I'm surprised this film didn't get more technical awards since it was one of the most exhilarating filmmaking experiences I had all year.The story was engaging though admittedly the characters were overly idealized.  This is especially true of King Mongkut who was far more educated dashing and genteel than it would have been reasonable to expect. Also the romantic overtones between him and Anna were a bit much.  But the way they were presented enhanced the overall effect so I have difficulty being too critical.The story also had some constructive subtleties.  In addition to the obvious storylines about the education of the children the effect Anna was having on the King and the impending war there was a deeper message.  It illustrated the truism that exposure to different peoples and cultures can help us to grow in understanding not only of them but of ourselves as well. For it was clear that Anna was as much changed by Siam and the King as he and the children were by her.I was highly impressed with the performance turned in by YunFat Chow.  His English is much improved since my last viewing of him in Replacement Killers' and The Corruptor'.  He imbued King Mongkut with dignity and strength without forsaking the human side.  The camera just eats him up.  It is easy to see why he has been the dominating force in eastern films for years.Jodie Foster on the other hand was off her game.  She was good as Anna but frankly we've come to expect more from her.  Foster is a powerful actor who didn't seem quite sure what to do with this character.  In some scenes she rose to the occasion and gave us the Anna we hoped for resolute defiant opinionated and principled.  At other times she seemed tentative and totally intimidated by the role just limping through her lines.  I give her high marks for her English accent but her total performance just wasn't up to her capabilities.This was one of the most entertaining and delightful films I've seen this year.  Yes liberties were taken but I am inclined to overlook them.  It was beautifully filmed and directed a feast for the senses.  I rated it a 910. I highly recommend it.".

I assumed it would be a remake either of the original 1946 movie or the better known Rodgers and Hammerstein musical of 1956.In actual fact the movie is neither a remake of these previous FOX efforts but rather an adaption of Anna Leonowens' own memoirs of the time she spent in Siam.Jodie Foster gave a fascinating beautiful performance as Anna. I found her portrayal of the character interesting as it was far different from Deborah Kerr's interpretation. Yul Brynner left his mark on the King in both stage and film versions of The King and I. However Chow Yun Fat in a different role is excellent. I feel they are both up with a chance for an oscar nomination.The film is a fine example of movie making. In addition to the supporting cast the costumes and art decoration were of an excellent standard. Although the film was shot in Malaysia and not Thailand I only suspected the film was not shot there because of all versions of the story being banned there. Despite the fact I have been to some of the Malaysian locations I hardly noticed it.Skeptical in my viewing of this movie because of my fondness for The King and I Anna and the King has forever shattered my illusions of the story. No longer can I picture the children swaying to the strains of Getting to Know You. However I was greatly surprised by this movie. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Rating 1010".

Despite the fact I have been to some of the Malaysian locations I hardly noticed it.Skeptical in my viewing of this movie because of my fondness for The King and I Anna and the King has forever shattered my illusions of the story. No longer can I picture the children swaying to the strains of Getting to Know You. However I was greatly surprised by this movie. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Rating 1010";

	schema:reviewBody "This is the second film of the year the other being The Green Mile that I have seen that I believe will recieve Oscar nominations in several categories of which best film best male and femal actor and best cinematography will be definitely considered.Anna and the King is an epic film about a British woman who accepts an offer to go to Siam Thailand to teach western education to the King of Siam's 58 children. Upon reaching Siam Ms. Leonowens Jodie Foster is made to find her way to the King's palace by herself and subsequently made to wait weeks before she is allowed to meet him. Coming from a British background she is appalled by this treatment and decides to take matters into her own hands by bursting into the King's court breaking every protocol on the way and boldly confronting King Mongkut Chow YunFat about her situation. This obviously does not sit well with the King but at the same time he is intrigued by this woman's boldness and so the story begins about cultural education both British and Siamese and a blossoming romance that has you yearning for a happy ending.Foster plays Anna Leonowens very well and at times makes you hate her for her narrow minded view of the world as she portrays a woman who truely believes that British teachings are the ways of the world. Her comments about British rule and colonization makes you cringe at times as she comes across as this arrogant cold woman who believes that she is in Siam to bring culture and wisdom to a backwards country. Foster manages to portray every aspect of this character flawlessly and takes the audience for an emotional rollercoaster from hate to love to compassion and every emotion in between.The most notable difference in character development is the portrayal of King Mongkut. Chow YunFat brings a quiet strength and sophistication that was never present in Yul Brynner's portrayal of the King. In this film we are shown a very intelligent man that understands more than he lets on. In fact he seems to lead Ms. Leonowens around without her really knowing it and in some cases teaches her lessons about the world and how it really is. As the saying goes actions speak louder than words and this is definitely the case for King Mongkut. Fat does not have as many lines as Foster does but he is in as many scenes and in most cases commands more of a presence.The rest of the cast was excellent as well and there were very few slow points in the film. The colors used were very vibrant and creates a feel of exoticness. As well the cinematography was incredible. Sweeping shots of the landscape showing the green carpets of the land and the incredible shots of the elaborate palace create an atmosphere of an epic film. Subtitles are used quite a bit but it only adds to the authenticity of the film.The one thing that I was disappointed in was the fact this movie was based on Ms. Leonowens' diary which may be subject to biased occurances of certain situations or historical inaccuracies.Overall though I was thoroughly impressed and entertained with this film. Although Jodie Foster is the top billing name this film definitely belongs to Chow YunFat and it would be ashame not to see him get an oscar consideration for his performance. He is an accomplished international actor and it seems that Hollywood has finally discovered that. My recommendation go see this film. You will not be disappointed.A".

	schema:reviewBody "Lush epic sweeping entrancing.  It's all here. If there's any justice in Hollywood this one should be Oscar bait for at least cinematography costuming musical score and the magnummagnificent presence of some dude I never heard of before I saw AATK  Chow Yun Fat.  Now I have been informed that he is the Coolest Actor in the World according to L.A. Times.  I can see this dark cool elegance in his breathtaking performance as a real and fascinating historic figure King Mongkut who in actuality learned Latin astronomy and memorized major parts of both Bible and Koran while a Buddhist monk.  Contrary to the buffoonery of Yul Brynner's overblown portrayal Chow opens for us an entirely new cultural door brushing for the eager audience a portrait of a monarch of absolutely power who wields it so well that he is unafraid of gentleness hugging his enchanting onscreen children without reserve and finding himself mystifyingly in love with a foreign woman he cannot tame or bed because of the constraint of the times. The betrayal revolution and barbarity of l9th century Thailand Siam become pale watercolor in comparison to the bold red and orange of unresolved love and religious and cultural interplay represented by Foster and Chow. We fear that more of these mesmerizing moments between the two lie on the editing room floor.  However Chow's sensitive face and body language reflect this inner evolution and bittersweet turmoil far better than does Jodie Foster's rather wooden performance accompanied by a troubling British accent. I respect Foster's talent immensely though it shone through only intermittently blossoming only when she softens to the King's patient sometimes stormy friendship.  The indelible etching of the film comes during a nonspeaking sequence involving the disposition of Tuptim and Balat which subplot likely was originally meant to be a subtle reflection of the untenable love affair between Anna and Mongkut. This is so welledited and scored that it's going to be hard to forget. When the King kneels in agonized prayer before his talismanic Emerald Buddha one is compelled to conclude that he is in anguish  not only over what's happening to his concubine and his throne  but the fact that his actions necessitated by politics will also probably forever separate him from his teatraytossing Anna and all she believes in and has worked for in his country.  Okay so I cried in several places something I nearly never do  the mark of a film which has accomplished its goal i.e. the moving of hearts. I was fascinated with this movie. It made me read and research a part of the world I've generally ignored and whole new palace gates have opened. Sumptuous and rich it is and awardwinning it should be but the sunstar opulence of this new guy Chow is the stellar pin on that film curtain. Thanks Mr. Tennant. And thank you Mr. Chow.".

There is a palpable chemistry between Jodie and Chow something not seen in the actresses films since she squared off with Anthony Hopkins' Lecter.  The script is solid and generally wellpaced.  Keen attention is paid to the dialog and interplay between the principals and the secondary characters too.  That they didn't actually film in Thailand but in Malaysia never shows on the screen.  The photography and costumes should be automatic nominees for Oscar.  For that matter both Jodie and Chow could comfortably fit in their respective nominee lists for Best Actor and Best Actress.  Overall a wonderful film and I'm really looking forward to the DVD in June!".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes this movies was certainly better than previous musicals and renditions of the Anna Leonowen's adventures in Thailand. It also is more historically accurate than those previous versions. Although this doesn't necessarily make it more culturally accurate as well so conclusions shouldn't be made concerning how Thailand is today. Of the acting it is true what everyone else has been saying that both Jodie Foster and Chow YunFat acted extremely well. I've always been a Chow YunFat fan. He's certainly a versatile actor this I know from his Asian movies but this is his breakout performance in America. Basically if you really like great acting then you'll love this movie. Anna and the King is also a very heartwarming movie mixed with enough excitement to please most people.This isn't entirely a romance movie either. A history lesson is trying to be told here. Although as documentaries go...well Anna and the King is not 100 correct. However history seems so much more drier if it was told by facts alone. No one would go pay money to see documentaries in movie theaters but they will go to see a movie especially if it's a good movie. Anna and the King is a good movie. Some people have griped about the theme song the one scene with explosion and whether or not the title of the movie appeared in the credits. For those people keep in mind that what makes a movie a good movie can be found in the story acting and directing of the movie not in the theme song or any other locations in the credit.Concerning the length of the movie every movie these days seem to go past the two hour mark which is some sort of current trend in movies. Personally I don't mind this as it allows me to let myself go and be sympathetic for the characters as if they had meaning for two hours and nine minutes in my life. Besides the acting was so well done that you won't get bored at anytime during the movie. Anna and the King will be one of the best two hours nine minutes you will spend this year if you see it.".

There are only two other movies I would consider to be worthy of masterpiece status Saving Private Ryan and Titanic. Now a third can be added to this list Anna And The King. Anna and The King is a true masterpiece that is filled with heart  soul a beautful setting and superb performances.I was very impressed with the performance of ChowYun Fat because he made the transition from action star to dramatic actor flawlessly. Fat showed his versatility in playing a king. Fat pulled off this role with perfection. He made it so easy for me to enjoy this movie because of his screen presence and believability of the performance as well as the chemistry between Anna and the King.This masterpiece can not be completed without the performance Jodie Foster turned in. Foster delivers the type of performance worthy of an oscar. She once again has established herself among the elite that have the special gift of natural talent.Foster and Fat come together beautifully to bring the true story of the romance of Anna Leonowens and King Momokut. The chemistry can be felt from a distance and it works from the first minute they come together. I knew Foster and Fat were compatible however I failed to realize how much until I viewed the movie.Anna and The King is visually stunning in so many ways with beautiful settings such as the palace. Also the costumes are wellmade and suited the movie perfectly. Anna  The King will take you on a journey that will touch warm and fill your heart with spirit only a motion picture masterpiece can bring.".

	schema:headline " questionable history but a wonderful movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Since the movie builds on unreliable historic source materials including the diaries of Anna Leonowens it credits it can't hope to be good history. However as a fictional story loosely based on the time of Kings Mongkut and Chulalongkorn it's a wonderful movie.The movie as bad historyThe movie credits the diaries of Anna Leonowens as its source presumably meaning her books about her five years as an English teacher in Siam Thailand. Other historical sources discredit much of the material in her books as selfpromoting ethnocentric and often simply fictional. The movie appears to draw from more accurate sources as well but shouldn't be mistaken for good history.According to the movie's Thai detractors the worst divergence from history seems to be the Tuptim subplot which to avoid spoilers I won't outline. Although Anna's books apparently tell of such events other sources from the time period Thai and Western either fail to confirm her telling or directly contradict her. If Tuptim were to disappear from the movie after she joined Anna's class Thailand would have no good reason to ban it.Another point in the movie that Thailand may have found embarrassing  slavery  is historically accurate. Around one fourth of the population was bound by debtslavery. King Chulalongkorn abolished slavery in 1909. The movie credits Anna with planting the idea which probably exceeds even her own selfpromotion.In addition to Anna's historically unreliable books the movie mixes in elements of her son's real friendship with King Chulalongkorn the crown prince in the movie and that king's reign.The real Anna was mentioned only once in King Mongkut's diaries. She was apparently nothing more than a hired English language teacher never an advisor at court. However Anna's son Louis Timothy returned to Bangkok. He was a friend of King Chulalongkorn an advisor at court and founder of a timber company that still exists.The real King Mongkut had only eight wives and about 15 children and had spent 27 years as a monk before becoming king. King Chulalongkorn had 50 wives and about 39 children. The movie's King Mongkut mixed his monastery background with the many marriages of King Chulalongkorn.The Thai language is badly pronounced according to others I don't know a word of it. The reallife Anna claimed to be fluent but wasn't so the movie Anna's bad pronunciation would have been closer to history than to Anna's stories. Of course the king's bad Thai would detract from the movie for anyone who knew how the language really sounds.The movie as great cinemaWhatever its historical faults Anna and the King is wonderful big screen entertainment. The acting cinematography costumes sets natural locations and directing are all great and the screenplay is generally good.Jodie Foster is wonderful as usual. Chow YunFat is excellent also in what appears to be his first serious English language drama after a long history of mostly action movies I haven't seen. All of the supporting actors are at least competent and many are good or excellent. The many child actors are particularly impressive.The visual experience of the movie is wonderful. The costumes are spectacular and quite historically reasonable. The palace and other sets are grand and wondrous. The natural locations are beautiful. The cinematography is a treat for the eyes and well worth seeing on the big screen.The screenplay is good but it has some weaknesses. A real strength of the screenplay is how it expresses the king's strength and cleverness in the face of imperialism. Thailand is the only country in Southeast Asia to avoid European colonial domination thanks to Kings Mongkut and Chulalongkorn and the script deserves credit for showing that notable accomplishment.The revolt subplot is another strength bring action and a dramatic climax into the movie. Historically the kings were limited to constitutional monarchy but not until the 1930s. The classroom scenes give the lots of time to Jodie Foster and the adorable child actors and hint at the future reallife friendship between the prince and Anna's son.The weakest part of the story is the Tuptim subplot. It is the most obvious disagreement with history and is probably Thailand's main reason for objecting to the movie. It contradicts the nature of the king's character and adds length to a movie that's already too long for some viewers. The best part is that it puts Bai Ling on screen too bad the script didn't give her a part that improved the movie.Overall the movie is one of the best of the year as long as it's not mistaken for history. It's beautiful wonderfully performed and has a story that's good in spite of one notable flaw.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anna and the King takes a fascinating story and surrounds it with breathtaking onlocation visuals and costumes. The film is about the clashing of two cultures and the way that two very different people overcome those cultural differences and are able to learn a great deal from each other. The destructive effects of Hollywood are virtually nonexistent in this beautifully made picture and the acting is excellent.The painful clashing of these two polar opposite cultures is wellportrayed in numerous hardships that are experienced by Anna the King the King's children as well as a number of other characters. The thing that really makes this film stand out is the fact that it is true to reality. Obviously because it is based on a true story but so was The Perfect Storm. That was a true story that was absolutely demolished by Hollywood. The story in Anna and the King was made even more interesting by the staggering visuals the beautifully designed costumes  and the excellent acting rather than the cartoonish excessiveness of films like The Perfect Storm.One thing that should be noted about Foster's performance is her deftness in playing an English woman. There are only two wellknown actresses who can successfully portray characters with different accents than their own. One is Gwyneth Paltrow and the other is Jodie Foster. These rare and very enviable skills can be seen most clearly in Shakespeare In Love and Anna and the King respectively. Foster is perfect as the widowed English mother who takes upon herself the task of educating the King's many children.Every scene in Anna and the King is filled with amazing cinematic technique and beautiful photography. The notable direction added fascinating elements to the already interesting story and all of the actors involved even the action veteran Fat performed wonderfully. Anna and the King is a great drama it is wellmade wellacted and beautifully directed. This one shouldn't be missed.".

Anna and The King is a true masterpiece that is filled with heart  soul a beautiful setting and superb performances.I was very impressed with the performance of ChowYun Fat because he made the transition from action star to dramatic actor flawlessly. Fat showed his versatility in playing a king. Fat pulled off this role with perfection. He made it so easy for me to enjoy this movie because of his screen presence and believability of the performance as well as the chemistry between Anna and the King of Siam.This masterpiece can not be complete without the performance Jodie Foster gave as Anna Leonowens. Foster delivered the type of performance worthy of an Oscar. She once again has established herself among the elite that have the special gift of natural talent.Foster and Fat come together beautifully to bring the true story of the romance of Anna Leonowens and King Momokut.

	schema:reviewBody "Anna Leonowens is bestknown today as the character played by Deborah Kerr in The King and I but she was a real person not a fictional one and her story was also told in the film Anna and the King of Siam from 1946 which I have never seen. Anna and the King is Hollywood's second nonmusical version of her story. Anna was a widowed British schoolteacher who travelled to Siam as Thailand was then known to become tutor to the many children and wives of King Mongkut. In reality she seems to have had little contact with the King himself but her diaries suggested otherwise and Westerners have long been fascinated by the supposed friendship which grew up between them. Some of the elements of this film will be recognisable to anyone familiar with The King and I. Both films mention Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Uncle Tom's Cabin and feature a doomed romance between Lady Tuptim one of the King's concubines and a commoner. There are of course lots of outrageously cute children running about everywhere. The fictitious subplot in which Anna helps the King foil a military coup by a treacherous general however appears to be an invention by the scriptwriters for this film. Like The King and I the film was banned in Thailand on account of its allegedly disrespectful portrayal of King Mongkut it would appear that the country's lsemajest laws protect not only the current monarch but also his predecessors. This rather heavyhanded censorship seems strange in a country which claims or did until the recent military coup to be a democracy imagine the storm of protest which would have been unleashed had the British government for example attempted to censor Mrs Brown because of the way it depicted Queen Victoria. The film could not of course be shot in Thailand itself and filming took place in Malaysia. The casting of Chow Yunfat rather than a European like Yul Brynner as Mongkut seems to have been an attempt by the filmmakers to placate local concerns but does not seem to have succeeded in this aim. Racial sensitivities in the Far East are not always the same as Western ones the casting of three Chinese actresses as Japanese characters in Memoirs of a Geisha gave rise to protests in both China and Japan and to Thais the casting of a Chinese actor as one of their country's most revered monarchs may have seemed just as insensitive as the casting of a Westerner. Chow's interpretation of the role is rather different from Brynner's more sensitive and less autocratic and selfassured. One thing which may have offended the Thais is the depiction of the relationship between Anna and the King. With Kerr and Brynner it was clear that their relationship was based upon friendship and mutual respect but the question of whether they had actually fallen in love was left discreetly unanswered. With Chow and Jodie Foster it is all too clear that they are in love if not lovers in the sexual sense and the historical accuracy of this is to say the least doubtful. The emphasis of the story has shifted somewhat since the days of The King and I. That film was made in the midfifties a period when many regions of the globe were still under European colonial rule something subtly reflected in the script. The Siam ruled by King Yul was a charmingly backward country which needed to be dragged kicking and screaming into the nineteenth century a task which would have been undertaken by the colonial powers had its own ruler not resolved to do it himself. Here Anna arrives in Siam inwardly convinced of the superiority of Western culture and that her role will be to play a part in the enlightenment of a barbarian nation. As the story progresses however she realises that the real situation is far more complex and that the West has as much to learn from the East as vice versa. The teacher is taught. The film is visually attractive and beautifully photographed and features an excellent performance from Foster possibly the most accomplished Hollywood actress of the nineties. She also copes well with her character's British accent something which cannot be said of all American actors called upon to play British characters. Foster's gift for accents is one of a number of characteristics she shares with Meryl Streep possibly the most accomplished Hollywood actress of the eighties. The film does however suffer at times from a lack of plausibility particularly in the subplot involving the rebel general something inserted to turn it into a standard thriller with an identifiable villain. Were Siamese soldiers of this period really so badly trained that they would have mistaken the sound of fireworks for that of gunfire? Anna and the King makes for enjoyable viewing but it might have worked better with a different denouement. 710 Some goofs. The story takes place during the early 1860s when King Mongkut would have been in his sixties far older than the character played by Chow YunFat. Reference is made to the King of France even though at this period France was ruled by Emperor Napoleon III. Admittedly the distinction might have seemed academic to the Siamese but no French diplomat would have committed the solecism of referring to his monarch as le Roi rather than l'Empereur. And the royal children sing the song Daisy Daisy which was not written until the 1890s possibly as a satirical comment on Daisy Countess of Warwick mistress of the Prince of Wales.".

Unfortunately almost no one in Hollywood gave it a second thought or may be they only saw Jodi Foster.Don't get me wrong Jodi Foster was great in her roll. However ChowYun Fat was even better considering his background as a new comer to the Hollywood scene. Yes it wasn't his first week here in the USA but one that has followed his career over the past 1020 years could see the remarkable improvement in his acting and language skills.Well ChowYun Fat was always great in almost any roll he was given back in Hong Kong. Now this movie really brought out the emotions deep inside him. We were also extremely impressed with his vastly improved English skills. Although he had to pretend having a sort of heavy accent while playing the roll of a Thai king learning English.It was known that ChowYun Fat hired a personal speechlanguage instructor to improve his chances of landing a big roll here. From this movie we bet that both with his hard work and the great instructor it has paid off.Like I said before unfortunately ChowYun Fat hasn't seeing the rewards for his efforts being recognized in Hollywood. As Jackie Chan mentioned Asian actors only get the action hero or martial arts roll in Hollywood. They do not ever get the recognition that they deserve for any other rolls specially those of Leading Man. It is as if Hollywood only see's Asian actors in action movies ONLY. I can assure you that they are much more capable than that.The only recognition Asians get are for women. When will this Hollywood BIAS end?!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a good movie and it's very much worth seeing. Visually it is stunning the fake palace they built and the geography is well worth the price. There are some complications that make it less than great however. These problems might be inherent in the material adapting an actual English lady's actual diary. Should one poke fun at the colonializing 19th century British? The various local political rivals who evidently were more than willing to accept British trade and other help in exchange for fulfillment of personal ambitions? Or does one go entirely modern and politically correct and pretend that the entire planet was a Berkeley coffee house just waiting for a chance to express neoMarxist thought?This movie tried really hard to appear p.c. and historical at the same time. There were some glaring inconsistencies however e.g. the British woman was evidently shocked by the death penalty being applied for what amounted to treason against the king and yet in her own country just 15 years before the death penalty was routinely applied to shoplifters petty thieves vagrants and anyone else the English nobility found inconvenient annoying or simply yucky.The domestic montages were at times awkward and fakey. E.g. when the camera tried to build a sense of Hey we're getting along now! by roaming around the palace grounds showing the king his kids his old ladies and Anna all noticing birds and smiling at each other noticing ducks and smiling at each other noticing cutesypoo antics of the young ones and smiling at each other. That was very stilted and phony feeling.But this movie was much better than the critics mostly said. For example for me the relationship between the king and the teacher was actually very realistic quite believable and powerful. So maybe it's just that many professional critics don't like to see what real humans might do in a love situation with complications after all they do go apoplectic whenever a movie wants you to feel something deep and real. So ignore them and enjoy it for what it is a valiant and earnest effort to tell a complicated and difficult story. I gave it an 8.".

	schema:reviewBody "A drama made in 1973 under the direction of experienced master Carlos Saura and with an active starring of then young Geraldine Chaplin Ana. Ana is a non Spanish lady coming to work to a big residence as a baby sitter. There she finds a family consisting of three brothers and their mother two of them single and the other one married with three daughters. The presence of Ana caused a kind of revolution in the house. She was young goodlooking and using normal provocative clothes of that time. The married man became crazy about her and started sending letters declaring his desires to be with her using different names and origin in the letters. Obviously this was at the end known by the eldest brother who was less attracted by Ana but wanted her to take care of his roommuseum of military clothes. He also used to practice shooting. The last brother was the one very much religious who organized himself in a nearby cave trying to live as an abstemious man. In addition to this environment the old mother of these brothers was a person having serious nervous problems. At the end Ana started to sympathize with the abstemious man who rejected her at the beginning and wanted her to cut her hairs. The presence of Ana was disturbing in that house to the extent that the wife of the married brother jealous wanted to kill herself. Finally Ana decided not to live anymore in that house although initially she was clearly expelled from the house. She collected all her belongings and when she was leaving the house the three brother came over her the married man violated her with the aid of the others then the abstemious cut her hairs and the militarylike man finally shoot her.It is an original film of Saura and very interesting to all who like good films.".

But I liked the doomed atmosphere of the film. The character of Fernando the religious brother is unforgettable and his interaction with Ana is the most interesting storyline in the film as she is both appalled by him and attracted to his way of life as if understanding why he wants to escape from the world. By the way the actor Fernando FernanGomez also plays Geraldine Chaplin's dying husband in the movie 'City of no limits'. There is a touching moment when the whole family gathers looking at the horny brother's wife attempting suicide Ana hugs one of the girls and then Fernando takes the girl away from her. The ending of the film is too abrupt but I still recommend Ana y los lobos to anyone who likes the film of this director.".

P.S This is a very emotional film and for people who feel emotional I suggest a few hankies provided especially at the end.";

Annabelle's Wish is another one of my favourites. It looks beautiful the character designs are skillfully drawn and the backgrounds are colourful and fluid. The score is wonderfully whimsical and the songs are catchy while the writing is amusing and sweet and the story of friendshipalways has been a great value gives you that warm and cosy feeling as a Christmas movie should do and is genuinely touching without being sentimental. The characters are really likable especially Annabelle who is just adorable and you identify with her immediately. Billy also is enough to warm the heart. The voice acting from the likes of Kath Soucie Jerry Van Dyke Clancy Brown Randy Travis and Cloris Leachman is very good. Overall a cute touching animation that is perfect for the Christmas season or if you want something very relaxing to watch. 1010 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED THE MOVIE! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS ABOUT PLOT POINTS!A classic straight out of the middle of my childhood Annabelle's Wish is a kid's Christmas film about a talking calf who wants to become one of Santa's reindeer and a mute boy who struggles to live with his disability. When I was young this was my favorite Christmas film surprisingly blowing A Charlie Brown Christmas out of the water I didn't understand much of the humor in the Peanuts cartoons or the comics. The bond between Annabelle and Billy was my first taste of bittersweet endings Although it was mostly sweet rather than bitter otherwise it wouldn't be much of a kid's movie and sort of set the standard for these sort of altruistic stories. I didn't understand much of the main conflict involving Aunt Agnes and how she was going to take Billy away so unfortunately that wasn't really a part I could get involved in. But the impact it left with the ending was something I was able to walk away with permanently changing the way I thought about how unimportant my wants were compared to others' needs.A decade later I stumbled upon the full movie on YouTube so I thought I'd give it a look. Surprisingly it hasn't changed much. The bit with Aunt Agnes was something I could understand Custody of kids and whatnot but it wasn't something I was particularly interested in. It was still the bond between Annabelle and Billy that I could stay involved in. Although many of the potentially real moments in the movie were made clich and corny I can understand seeing that it was made mostly for kids. Overall it's great for kids who are looking for something to do on Christmas as well as give a lesson in selflessness. Helped steer me into thinking about putting myself in others' shoes rather than always thinking for myself. Adults can watch too if they're willing to bear the overused lines as well as awkward kid gags that really aren't that funny. Not that I care. Still gonna be one of my favorite movies I've ever watched.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're a parent and are looking for something to show your 312 yo kids on the dark evenings before Christmas I can recommend you to show them this movie. I will list a few of the good parts of this movie and a few of the bad parts of this movie so you can decide for yourself. If your child likes farms then I can truly recommend it. And given that I'm a more grumpy person than Scrooge and a notorious critic when it comes down to children stuff and I tend to smash down films that offend the intelligence of kids I think that will hopefully say something. The goodThe relationships in this movie are very genuine especially between the main characters Billy and Annabelle. They are well build up sweet and have meaning behind them especially in the decisions they make and how they care for each other. A cheap gimmick often used in other children movies I'm looking at you Care Shits I mean Bears is that a child has ''suffered'' from something just to make it all dramatic but in the end it is all contrived doesn't make sense and means nothing. In this movie however there is actually build up to events that happened to Billy and they are shown to the audience.  The struggles the grandfather of Billy is going through are very well understood and have a lot of meaning.  The dramatic moments are very sweetgenuine and can cause tears and are not forced in.The badthe trick behind characters in stories for young children is to make archetypes so they are more easily understood. This often gets confused for making stereotypes and this movie sometimes falls into that trap especially with Slim the pig and with the chickens. Fortunately though those character do not matter a whole lot except of being filler to fill up the animals needed on a farm. With 53 minutes I still find it a tad short. I wouldn't have mind learning more from our main characters.  The designs are rather bland and the animation is not the best ever. This does really impact the experience however. Some emotional scenes drag on too long while others are in my opinion too short.In conclusion despite a couple of flaws it is a very sweet and genuine tale that actually can move a person and I believe children can enjoy it. For adults it may seem a bit bland however.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first heard of this Christmas special when one of my university classmates recommended it to me when she said the storyline of 'Olive The Other Reindeer also very good' reminded her of the plot of this one due to Annabelle and Olive both wanting to become reindeer although Annabelle's true wish was Billy being able to talk again. I watched the first half of this on YouTube in the runup to last Christmas and I found it rather enjoyable. This morning when I decided to watch the whole thing from the beginning due to having forgotten where exactly I'd left off I was more satisfied because I got more out of it than I had done previously.Although the character designs looked pretty generic particularly the humans I soon got used to them and although I initially thought Emily also the name of the girl at uni who recommended this to me was a boy she was an endearing sidecharacter and I found Annabelle absolutely adorable. When I first saw her she reminded me of the ponies in the original 1980s 'My Little Pony' cartoon. Billy is a character who anyone watching this special would deeply sympathise with his grandfather is supportive while Aunt Agnes is selfindulgent and the father of the boys who torment Billy and Emily is strict. The rest of the animal characters are more than worthy if Slim the pig is somewhat clichd and stereotypical despite his name being the complete opposite of how he looks. The animation is fluid with rich shading and great uses of principles most notably squash and stretch and followthrough and overlapping action. Both the background designs especially those in the snowy exterior scenes and the springtime sequence and music are beautiful. I particularly liked the songs accompanying Annabelle's dream of herself jumping in the sky like a reindeer and the springtime sequence. The story and the dialogue are both heartbreaking Billy becoming mute when being traumatised by the barn fire and heartwarming Billy and Annabelle eventually getting their wishes and I liked the ending of Billy and Emily as a married couple and Annabelle becoming a real reindeer. The voice acting has some great variety to it and Santa's voice here is more convincing and realistic than that in the mediocre 'The Christmas Tree where it sounded creepy and robotic. There are more wellknown voices in the cast of this special than first thought including Randy Travis Cloris Leachman Hydia in 'My Little Pony The Movie' Kath Soucie and Frank Welker.Despite its generic character designs and one clichd stereotypical character 'Annabelle's Wish' is a charming heartbreaking and heartwarming Christmas special that I would happily watch every festive season. 810.".
