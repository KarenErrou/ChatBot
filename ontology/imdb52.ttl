One day after a day of exploring they are approached by a couple played by David Anders and Marsha Thomason. They tell the young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef and find a rare artifact about Columbus' hidden treasure that is reported at the bottom of the reef.Next day the four dive to the bottom of the reef and of coarse after a whole day of diving they find nothing. A few more days past and the two hired divers found out that they a part of a major deadly plot in which they can't escape otherwise they will be killed. They were hired to find two big containers. One contains a nuclear reactor and the other contains a core.The movie also has a back story about another person brother of the lead character trying to patch things up with his girlfriend I reckon this part of the story was a waste of time this also includes a very steamy sex scene between the couple which to me is a complete waste and wasn't needed to be shown.However apart from that this movie does have some good underwater photography and the colors blend in well which is why it receives 4 stars. Into The Blue 2 is a sequel only by name. None of the original actors or characters return it has a dumb plot stupid characters and a boring climax.".

	schema:reviewBody "Oh boy this is the sort of film that makes you feel sorry for Hollywood screenwriters. I mean everybody's got to pay bills so you figure you'll take a job writing the directtoDVD sequel of Jessica Alba movie. How bad can it be? And then your producer says you've got to write a part for an MTV reality star create an entire second set of characters because the leading lady won't take her top off inject an IraqAfghanistan war theme into the movie because somebody wants to pretend they're relevant and to top it off you've got to jerry rig an ending out of spit and bailing wire when the production runs out of money. No wonder writers drinkand so many of them commit suicide.Sebastian and Dani Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort are a young impossibly good looking pair of lovers who run a diving business in Hawaii. They've spent years looking for a famed shipwreck with only a single doubloon to show for it. Then one day they're hired by an international couple who say they're looking for the same ship wreck. Carlton and Azra David Anders and Marsha Thomason are wealthy and mysterious and turn out to have a hidden agenda. And then they have another agenda hidden under that which gets explained in a scene that is literally jaw droppingly stupid.In the midst of all that a few girls show their breasts there's some nicely filmed underwater scenes and the movie rolls out a total of 8 montages to kill time. Yes I said 8 montages. The rule in cinema is generally that more than 2 montages means your film sucks but 8 takes it to a completely different level. 8 montages moves beyond considerations of good and bad and almost turns this motion picture into a force of nature like an earthquake or Galactus.Now this is a talented enough cast director Stephen Herek looks like he knows what he's doing and the dialog isn't atrocious but this script is dragged to the bottom of the sea by way too many creative requirements. Here's the most obvious one. The folks who made Into The Blue 2 The Reef wanted there to be nudity and naked breasts do show up at regular intervals. Usually the lead actress is a big part of that but these guys gave that part to Laura Vandervoort who refused to get nude. She's beautiful and a decent actress and all that but not being willing to take your clothes off should be a deal breaker for this kind of role. So writer Mitchell Kapner was tasked with inserting a secondary female character into the story to do the nudity that Vandervoort wouldn't which also required the insertion of a secondary male character so she'd have someone to do a sex scene with.To his credit Kapner tries to give those secondary characters their own storyline but it detracts from both the two leads and the villainous couple they face off with. It's this obtrusive third wheel that boggles up the plot takes away characterization time from the stars of the show and it's blazingly obvious that it's only in the film because Vandervoort wouldn't show her glorious tata's.The screenplay is burdened with too many other things like that from two painfully bad scenes with Audrina Patridge from MTV's The Hills to a treasure hunting movie ludicrously morphing into an espionage flick with an antiwar message to an ending so cheaply pulled off it can't possibly have been the original idea. This production spent a good chunk of money shooting a lot of expensive underwater footage and then it's big explosive conclusion is almost Ed Woodian in its staging and execution.I haven't seen Into The Blue though I'm fairly certain Jessica Alba doesn't take her clothes off in it. Maybe if she had these producers would have felt compelled to get an actress who would do the same which would probably have made Into The Blue 2 The Reef significantly better. She didn't so they didn't so it's not.".

I liked the actors in both  Nick Nolte Robert Shaw  Jacqueline Bisset in The Deep and Paul Walker Scott Caan  Jessica Alba in Into the Blue  but unless you're rabid fans of Bisset and Alba or the guys neither film ever rose above the level of average.2009's directtovideo Into the Blue 2 The Reef is a sequelinnameonly that successfully builds on the template of those other two films delivering a far more entertaining experience IMHO.Into the Blue 2 simply has a more engaging story more dazzling filmmaking and better more numerous bikiniclad babes. In other words everything that you might be looking for in an island thriller is here only better than those earlier pictures. Although the main cast is relatively noname Chris Carmack Laura Vandervoort Marsha Thomason  Dave Anders they do a splendid job plus the film is highlighted by two solid cameos of Parvati Shallow Survivor and Audrina Patridge both incredibly gorgeous. Another highlight is the ultraserious and thrilling final act which comprises the last 35 minutes or so. Up to that point the story is pretty much just a fun lighthearted beachdiving flick. The dramatic change in tone works in the film's favor and keeps it from being onedimensional.Since Into the Blue 2 The Reef is a directtovideo release it cost a fraction the expense of The Deep and Into The Blue the latter of which cost a whopping 50 million believe it or not. This makes an interesting study Filmmakers can make better films at a fraction of the cost it's simply a matter of ingenuity. Hats off to director Stephen Herek writer Mitchell Kapner and the cast  awesome job! Into the Blue 2 was shot in Hawaii whereas the other two were filmed in the Caribbean.The runtime is 92 minutes.GRADE A".

For one thing there wasn't that much skin in the movie as some would exaggerate that it does also no it doesn't have A list actors in it . The movie was very entertaining . I loved the first one too. I was setting myself up to be disappointed in the 2nd one but was surprised. The acting was great for non Alist actors very entertaining and great story. I learned along time ago to not listen to reviewers . If you like ocean movies which I do judge for your self . Just cause I like ocean movies doesn't mean I like them all. I have seen some really bad ones but this is not one of them. I bought this one for my DVD collection to go right beside the first one that was also a great movie. I only gave this 10 stars cause of the bad reviews it received that it didn't deserve at all . It may not really be a 10 but its well over average. Watch it !".

	schema:reviewBody "Oh my goodness where do I start? I remember hearing about this movie back in 2009 when I saw it on a shelf at Target back then. I remember being curious about it because I kind of enjoyed the first movie but in some ways I was a little iffy about it. I remember wanting to watch it but I didn't buy it until October of last year but I didn't actually watch it until a few weeks ago and man I really wish that I didn't.I am going to say this I have SOMEWHAT of a thing for unrelated directtovideo sequels. I know that a lot of them turn out not to be so good. Some are watchable. Some just happen to have the name slapped on it and it's the same thing but it turns out to be really bad. Few are actually good and this is not one of those movies. It was really bad.Now I am not going to deny that the movie has a lot of eye candy. It had some great visuals of Hawaii great underwater sequences and of course great looking women. Laura Vandervoort Mircea Monroe Marsha Thomason Audrina Patridge even some of the other female characters who we didn't get to know were all smoking hot. However that's as far as I can go when it comes to the positives. Now on to the negatives.The plot is almost a replica of the first film yet there were some differences. The other couple in this one were more like a comic relief couple and didn't get them into the trouble that the couple in the first one did. Plus it felt kind of predictable who the villains were. Right at the beginning I kind of sensed that the British people were going to be revealed as the villains more than halfway through the movie but I saw it coming from a mile away. Second what was the point in the little antiwar subtext that came out of left field? I understand that they tried to differ from the first one being the illegal treasure that is found at the bottom of the ocean was a nuclear weapon as opposed to drugs but why bomb Hawaii? Also another thing that I thought that was badly done was when they killed off Mircea Monroe's character. I get that in a lot of movies there has to be at least one casualty in the protagonist group but I really didn't think that her character needed to be iced unless the writers wanted it to resemble the first film. But in the first film the reason the other girl died was because she got bit by a shark but she was somewhat of an antagonist anyway. This movie on the other hand didn't have a reason to kill her off and then later on have a little funeral for her and then it was like it didn't happen. The actor could have shown that he was more broken up about his girlfriend's death than he actually did.There are some more negative things that I could point out. One the henchman who can't swim. I kind of chuckled when I saw that part when he was drowning at sea. Also the mini subplot with Audrina Patridge's character coming up and talking all fast was really pointless and her boyfriend wasn't even a major character in the movie. Also Laura's character making a fast recovery from hypothermia. Okay I can let that one slide because it was a plot device and she had to go back to her boyfriend and friends eventually. But wait this was a major goof if I ever saw one and I am sure I am not the only one who saw this after she ran into a cop and her boyfriend's rival they take the guy's boat to go find her boyfriend and friend. But that's not the bad part the bad part is that we last saw her wearing a hospital gown but when we saw her meet up with her friends we see her wearing a different shirt and you see the bikini string coming out of the shirt collar. Okay for one thing she wouldn't had enough time to go and change her shirt because she had to meet her friends to help them. Even she did have enough time the best thing she could do is just get a shirt not a bikini top along with it. I thought that was a major error when I saw it.I could really go on about how bad this movie is. The first movie wasn't special either but I found it entertaining in some areas. This movie on the hand had so many errors and it suffered from bad writing and bad directing. Some of the acting was decent particularly from the villains but other than that it was a bad movie. Don't ever waste your time watching this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first Night at the Museum worked despite conventions for a few reasons but the main one was that it eased into its premise of museum exhibits coming to life and didn't take it for granted like Night of the Museum 2 Battle of the Smithsonian does. I'm actually surprised the writers of the first film wrote this sequel because Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant handle these characters like they're someone else's creation and they can butcher them all they want. Night at the Museum 2 sucks the magic out of the original and overdoses on characters as well as meandering sarcasm and awkward humor. Save some bright spots in character acting from a delightful and plucky Amy Adams and some bright spots from Hank Azaria and Christopher Guest Smithsonian will disappoint most defenders of the first film  except kids and anyone else who'll bite on an outrageous premise.Ben Stiller stars again as Larry Daley only our beloved night security guard has randomly become a mastermind of As Seen on TV products. That decision alone completely destroys the continuity between this film and the last forcing Larry's story to be something totally different than the single dad trying to be a role model for his son. Now son is hacking into the Smithsonian Institute floor plans to direct his dad to the location of the tablet that brings things to life at night. See the Museum of Natural History is going digital and all the beloved characters of the first film are shipped to the national archives in DC only that naughty monkey brought the tablet with him and so the Smithsonian has come to life.Our source of conflict is the Pharaoh at the Smithsonian Kahmunrah played by Azaria doing his best Stewie Griffin impression who wants the tablet to unleash his army so he gets help from Napoleon Ivan the Terrible Guest and young Al Capone. At least director Shawn Levy realized the asset they had in Azaria and had him voice a couple other key statues that come to life later on. Azaria's too good for this film really but he plays at its level instead of pushing it and even manages a few of the better laughs when he puts a major diss on Darth Vader.Then there's Amy Adams the lone diamond in a sea of forced comedy and excessive cameos. It might seem like loving Adams is the it thing but she brings the imaginative spirit sorely lacking in the film as Amelia Earheart. Every time she speaks it literally feels like the film gets more believable because she's such a convincing spirit. She also gets to work her best Katherine Hepburn impression to boot.But Smithsonian is more defined by its disappointments and synthetic sequel material. Lennon and Garant try and include too many characters between the old ones and the new ones and the film just feels chaotic. It's like a contest to see how many new ideas of different things they can bring to life from paintings and photos on the wall to historical monuments in DC. Worst of all it's completely rushed. Understood that we get the comingtolife premise and we aren't going to be surprised by it but they take all the fun out of it. Levy figures a shot a piece of the statues of Amelia and Bill Hader's Col. Custer are adequate foreshadow but they're not. Daley just cons his way into the archives and the story rockets right into the Smithsonian with a few quick facts about what it is to provide context.Night at the Museum 2 does just about everything we used to be terrified of sequels doing in the '90s  overdoing it and diverting from the core values that won some love for the original because that film wasn't just about things coming to life.Steven Chttpmoviemusereviews.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Well it's been 3 years since we had the comedy hit Night at the Museum naturally they went for a sequel to either make more money or spill the story for what it's worth. Eh I pick all of thee above. But surprisingly Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian was actually a lot better then I had expected in fact I think I enjoyed it much more then the first Night at the Museum. Now the first Night at the Museum movie was alright it didn't really thrill me Ben Stiller is praised so much as a comedic actor but I've only found him funny in Zoolander. But when it comes to movies like Meet the Parents There's Something About Mary and Night at the Museum it's usually the supporting cast that carries the movie and he seems just like the same character in every movie. Once again the supporting cast saves this movie and makes it a great family film.Larry Daley is now head of Daley Devices a company he founded to manufacture his inventions. These inventions including the GlowintheDark Flashlight were created from his experiences as a former night guard. He finds that the American Museum of Natural History is closed for upgrades and renovations and the museum pieces are moving to the Federal Archives at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC. On the last night Larry meets the museum pieces such as Teddy Roosevelt Rexy the T Rex Skeleton and Dexter the Monkey and finds out that several exhibits including Teddy Rexy the Easter Island Head and Ahkmenrah are not moving to The Smithsonian Institution the other exhibits will no longer be animated. The next night Larry gets a call from Jedediah saying that Dexter stole the tablet and that Kahmunrah Ahkmenrah's older brother is attacking them. Larry takes a plane to Washington and visits the National Air and Space Museum the National Gallery of Art and the Smithsonian Castle to find the Federal Archives.Over all Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian is worth the recommendation I'd say a matine if you want to see it with the family. Hank Azaria puts a bit of a strange personality for Kahmunrah but he provides quite a few good laughs. Along with Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan who are back as the cowboy and the roman soldier great chemistry right there. They have this scene that nearly killed me in laughter since they're so small they go 300 style in trying to stab all the bad guy's feet great style and homage to the war films. Amy Adams pulls in a great performance that I feel is going to be over looked as Amelia Earhart she has that old school Hollywood look to her and personality that was a perfect choice. There are some great moments in this sequel but there are some really silly one's as well so over all I'd say it's worth the look it's a good family film but again nothing too memorable.610".

I walked into the theater not expecting to much but when I left I was very happy with it. They handled every characters personality beautifully and the inside jokes were hilarious. I don't want to give much away but trust me you'll laugh. It tackles many themes like a house divided cannot stand the way to happiness is doing what you love don't dwell on the past etc. For a family flick they handle this jumbled cast of characters with complex personalities amazingly. They threw away most of the characters from the first movie to make way for the newer characters which I didn't like that much but how many characters can you throw in a story to have it make sense?This film is an amazing example of a movie made for kids and adults. Kids will enjoy the silly humor and the monkey. While adults will laugh at the onslaught of injokes and trust me there's a lot.All in all this was a great movie blew me away. The highlight for me was Hank Azaria that lisp kills me every time.".

This is not a terrible film by all means but as a sequel and film I couldn't help feeling disappointed.Granted the special effects were absolutely wonderful and the cinematography locations costumes sets and editing striking. Granted the score was rousing and fun and most of the direction solid. And granted the actors give it their all Ben Stiller is solid if occasionally going overboard Amy Adams and Hank Azaria are absolute hoots and Robin Williams returns as Roosevelt and along with Azaria is the standout of the actors playing the historical figures.However the recurring support cast aren't given much to do excepting Robin Williams Owen Wilson is rather annoying Napolean and Al Capone are written as quite badlywritten caricatures and don't get me started on the Jonas Brothers their presence added absolutely nothing to the proceedings and they were not funny at all. And if only there was a story and script that were consistently engaging but the script and sight gags are very hit and miss and the story is thin and these are further disadvantaged by the overlong length tacky ending and too many scenes that drag.In conclusion watchable but quite average. 510 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "There's an old saying in Hebrew that claims that if you try and catch as much as you can you'll end up having nothing at all. After viewing Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian I can sadly say that the same can be said when regarding this lesser sequel to the 2006 smash hit.Even though most film critics despised the original movie the first Night at the Museum was actually one of my favorite films of that year. For me the film worked on two levels. First by waking the innerchild in all of us and making us feel the magic Ben Stiller's character Larry experiences once the exhibits in his museum come to life in all their glory in front of him. Second by telling a very straightout and heart warming coming of age story of a grownup divorced man who has to take control of his life and get his act together with the museum working more as a metaphor of sorts. I also related to the additional educational values the film had to offer another theme I felt received a lesser emphasis in the sequel.In the second installment of the Night of the Museum series much of the initial magic is already lost from the getgo. We already know the artifacts come to life and how and the general feeling of suspense is gone. To make things worse the whole story feels convoluted and unreal. We're expected to believe that Larry has turned from a nogood night guard at the museum in the first film to this megasuccessful businessman in the second installment during the course of only a few years and after being a virtual nobody for the vast majority of his life. I mean come on Hollywood  Where did the charming loser from the first film go so quickly? Stiller's Larry is hardly likable at the beginning and once he learns that his lovable exhibitsfriends are moving to the Smithsonian museum after the Museum of Natural History closed for technological renovation things start happening so fast that his motives for leaving his comfortable job to help rescue his friends are left undeveloped and unconvincing.The main course of this sequel is of course the special effects created by the two museum's reanimated exhibits with the evil Egyptian Kamunrah The Simpson's Hank Azaria acting as the main villain who operates the evil Smithsonian exhibits who strive for world domination yadda yadda yadda. Some effects are cute Al Capone's gangsters brought back to life in black and white the heroes entering an old painting the Lincoln memorial rising from his chair amongst others and some are once again undeveloped and underused. At times it seems so much is happening on the screen that you don't really know where to look or who to concentrate on. Many returning characters from the first film are outrageously underused including Robin Williams' Teddy Roosevelt and Owen Wilson's Jedediah and many comedians who are brought specifically for the film contribute blinkandyoumissit performances including Ricky Gervais and Jonah Hill. The only true contribution for the film is the lovely Amy Adams Enchanted who portrays a fluffy reanimated Amelia Earhart who seems more lost than ever.To sum things up I'd say that Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian may have been cute at times but it was mostly useless as it really didn't add any significant notion to the elements presented in its predecessor. While that film felt like an instant classic to me this one felt more like a quick moneygrab with a lot of missed potential.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the outset. I kept wondering how ordinary security guard schlub Ben Stiller could so easily become an infomercial king hawking glow in the dark flashlights and earning gobs of money. Then I realized that the screenwriters couldn't just have him start off as a security guard at the museum again because people don't want to see the same thing twice when they pay money for a sequel. Nonetheless the infomercial angle ends up being dropped like a hot potato and Stiller is back at the museum just like in the original. This time he learns that his pals at the Museum of Natural History are being shipped off to the basement archives at the Smithsonian. To make matters worse they have to deal with some crazy Pharoah guy who needs to figure out a secret code that will unlock a door to ancient Egypt where all of his nasty minions are just waiting to get loose and wreak havoc upon an unsuspecting world.There are moments in 'Battle for the Smithsonian' that feel like the script was dispensed with and the action was completely improvised. Take the scene with Stiller trying to break into the basement at the Smithsonian opposed by the security guard played by Jonah Hill. The joke is that the security guard is a wuss and is easily dissuaded by the more persuasive Stiller. And this is the problem for every character in the film. They are all buffoons in one way or another and carry no moral weight.The antagonist is played by Hank Azaria who has a one note part as a lisping Pharoah Kahmunrah. He's joined by three villains from history Napoleon Bonaparte Ivan the Terrible and a young Al Capone. The three allies of the Egyptian have virtually nothing to do throughout the filmBonaparte at one point jumps on top of Stiller Capone waves a machine gun and Ivan basically scowls.Stiller's allies fare no better. Owen Wilson plays a miniature cowboy trapped inside an hourglass by Kahmunrah. We're supposed to laugh as he is gradually submerged by the sand inside the hourglass pouring down on top of him. Steve Coogan is Wilson's buddy playing another 'miniature' this time the famous Roman Emperor 'Octavius'. The Emperor's big moment is when he mistakes a squirrel for a giant creature and rides him back into the Smithsonian thinking he can take on Kahmunrah's army of bad guys. No laughs there! Bill Hader plays General Custer with an inferiority complex he bemoans the fact that he'll always be remembered for his one bad moment at the Little Big Horn with all his other accomplishments ignored. While Custer is a complete clown the Indian Princess Sacajawea berates him not for his hatred of Native Americans but rather for his incompetence as a soldier.It takes a long time before Stiller's love interest feminist icon Amelia Earhardt played by Amy Adams does what she does best i.e. fly a plane. But most of the time she's nothing more than the feeble love interest in the filmchasing Stiller around acting a bit spunky and providing moral support. Other wasted parts include Robin Williams as Teddy Roosevelt in dual incarnations as Teddy on horseback and as a talking bust a completely forgettable Attila the Hun and a bunch of grunting Neanderthals.The plot is quite disappointing. After Kahmunrah finds out the 'secret code' from a Bobblehead Albert Einstein and unleashes the forces of evil they all inexplicably run back into the portal after a giant Abraham Lincoln roused from his sleep at the Lincoln Memorial confronts them. Lincoln is reduced to an awkward giant more like Lurch of the old Adams Family TV series than the great statesman of American history.'Battle' was written mainly for the special effects department to show their stuff. There are a few clever visual effects when famous paintings come to life most notable is when Stiller and Adams jump into the famous scene on VJ Day with the sailor and the nurse making out in Times Square. Rodan's 'Thinker' comes to life as a wisetalking Guido and there are three angel statues singing updated rap versions of rb classics. All of this is nice to look at but it's simply not very funny.I have never been a big fan of Ben Stiller but here he outdoes himself in a role that relies mainly on slapstick humor. There is nothing clever or witty about Battle for the Smithsonian. It represents a further dumbing down of American comedy. And the producers here should heed the old admonitionwhat goes around comes around! Hopefully Kahmunrah will be putting a new curse on them in the futureat the box office where it hurts!".

Little did he knows that his friends at the Museum of Natural History are about to be shipped and stored at the famous Smithsonian Institute. Long story short he now has to save little Jedediah and Octavius from a pharaoh who is trying to take over the world. Sounds weird. Because it is. It feels like the writers were out of ideas.So what they do was they throw in a hell lot of characters including Kahmunrah a crazy pharaoh who is trying to take over the world Albert Einstein Abe Lincoln and even Darth Vader.The story seemed rush and some parts didn't make sense. For example why did Kahmunrah the threatens to suffocate Jedediah in an hourglass when Jedediah is just a little statue who will most probably come back to life the night after even if he 'died' today.But negativity aside I have to say that the actor that really stood out was Hank Azaria playing the villain Kahmunrah. He was loud and funny and not to mention he even voiced Abe Lincoln and The Thinker. Ben Stiller is just his usual self. And Amy Adams was fun and very adorable as the female pilot Amelia Earhart but the gungho attitude gets old pretty fast.The special effect and the score of the movie were okay. Not too good not too bad.Overall Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian is just another Hollywood bigbudget movie that has a massive room for improvement and really could've done so much better.".

The Museum they picked is not as insightful or magical as the one in the original bigger does not always mean better and I didn't care for most of the new characters they picked. Owen Wilson's Jedediah is more irritating than anything else now and Robin William's witty portrayal of Teddy Roosevelt is sadly wasted for the most part. Ben Stiller is slumming it here on auto pilot so to speak and everything just seems so crammed together with not that much heart or effort into it but the effects definitely were. Amy Adam's Amelia Earhart and Hank Azaria's Kahmunrah were probably the best characters in the film in my opinion I laughed my ass off when Hank made fun of Darth Vader. This is a fine example of where they should leave well enough alone Night At The Museum didn't need a sequel and while this wasn't awful I'll stick with the original.Performances. Ben Stiller is OK and has some funny bits but he's on auto pilot here a lot of the time and I didn't sense the same enthusiasm I did in the 1st with him. Amy Adams is great fun as Amelia Earnhart and I enjoyed every second she was onscreen. Owen Wilson is annoying here in my opinion and while I enjoyed him a lot of the time in the original here he got on my nerves. Hank Azaria is hilarious as Kahmunrah he stole a lot of the scenes he was in. Robin Williams is wasted as Teddy but shines with the scenes he has. Some of the crew from the original like Steve Coogan Ricky Gervais and Jake Cherry come back but are given little to do.Bottom line. This had its moments but I was really quite disappointed with the overall quality of it. It just seemed halfbaked in my opinion and just made to make some quick cash.

It's arguably better than the first.Although better on different levelsThe historic characters are not just new and improved but also come with a greater comic value. In what the film lacks in a relatively mundane storyline it compensates with a wonderful underlying messagemoral. There's also a love story again but what struck me as more potent was the greater bond that exists between the rest of the characters Larry and Jedediah Jedediah and Octavius etc. The scoremusic was noticeably better as well very listenable. Of course the whole picture was far more 'epic' and I for one am a fan of this. On the face of this its a comedy blended perfectly with action like a cocktail of strawberry and champagne  and very much like Tropic Thunder although on a different level of course. Hank Azaria was brilliant as Kahmunrah especially in the way he could turn from serious evil to lighthearted joker in the blink of an eye. Speaking of which him and his trio of evil helpers were fantastic together as am sure you'll all agree.The one downside is that too many of the best comedy moments were shown in the trailers so kind of dampening the effect of many of the genuinely funny moments. But there's still enough to keep you chuckling away! So should there be a third? If they can continue to make people laugh whilst rummaging through their popcorn during the action scenes I'd day why not? After all what is life without a bit of fun?".

Amy Adams was nearly taking over the film and although she was lovely in Enchanted she was trying too hard to be an enthusiastic flygirl here which annoyed me a lot. There were only about two to three scenes I found to be very funny the rest I fought to keep myself entertained.They shouldn't have gone with the Kahmunrah plot. It was a gimmicky and farfetched move and it wasn't working one bit. The Underworld was also absurd and didn't fit well with the theme of the movie.They recycled a few things from the first. It didn't get old but 3 out of how many attempted gags is far from satisfactory.From Tropic Thunder to this. No more Nights at the Museum. Ben Stiller should go back to pure comedy.".

Amy Adams was nearly taking over the film and although she was lovely in Enchanted she was trying too hard to be an enthusiastic flygirl here which annoyed me a lot. There were only about two to three scenes I found to be very funny the rest I fought to keep myself entertained.They shouldn't have gone with the Kahmunrah plot. It was a gimmicky and farfetched move and it wasn't working one bit. The Underworld was also absurd and didn't fit well with the theme of the movie.They recycled a few things from the first. It didn't get old but 3 out of how many attempted gags is far from satisfactory.From Tropic Thunder to this. No more Nights at the Museum. Ben Stiller should go back to pure comedy.";

But in attempting to oneup itself Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian directly copies its predecessor in spirit while simultaneously being even worse in practice than the already obnoxious original.I have quite literally never seen a film flaunt its budget so shamelessly. Museum 2 slides from unnecessary effects sequence to unnecessary effects sequence many of which aren't even that impressive. Add in about fifty too many characters a dull lead tedious pacing and stale humour and you have an experience that strangely I cannot call outwardly bad but is simply banal and monotonous in the worst way. Even the central players Ben Stiller as Larry Daley and Amy Adams as Amelia Earhart can't have more than 20 minutes of screen time each. It is as if the filmmakers went to the Smithsonian wrote down every single display and said alright lets fit these all into the movie. The whole film feels like it was sponsored by the Smithsonian and that flaw infused with the inflated budget leads to an endlessly fragmented endeavour. As if it was simply the aforementioned exec reading off the list of exhibits for the entire running time.The plot is actually nonexistent. The tablet of Ahmunrah from the original has been shipped to the Smithsonian along with all his faux friends from the Museum of Natural History in NYC where Daley has moved on from to become an inventor. After finding out the news he then rushes to Washington to save them. But a struggle erupts between the bad and good displays as they come to life during the night. End plot and let the battle begin. All I can say is thank god that Hank Azaria is in this film he plays the evil Egyptian conqueror Kahmunrah because is he was absent this would have been utterly utterly disastrous more so than it already is. I believe I laughed exactly four times in addition to Azaria's scenes once at a fairly inspired 300 reference at a cameo from Jonah Hill a sequence with some bobblehead Einstein's and a few gags with Larry and his flashlight. That is about a laugh every half hour in a film that was already far too long.At the very least when you have a movie like this there is a chance for redemption with a strong lead which Stiller does not supply. He is doing it for a paycheque and boy does it show. Adams as Earhart is fine but actually a tad slutty and the budget also seems to also have covered cheques for about every single comedian working in Hollywood from stars of The Office to Bill Hader Ricky Gervais Steve Coogan Robin Williams Owen Wilson et al. Cameos famous exhibits effects and the 'story' all combine into nothing a tedious soulless and uninspired film that somehow manages to squander the cast effortlessly. The only battle I will ever admit to being associated with was the battle to stay awake.Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "The first Night at the Museum is one of my favorite movies and I had high hopes for this one but what happened??? First the bad there were several characters that I was really disappointed to see did not have big or at least significant parts especially Ricky Gervais and Owen Wilson. Ricky Gervais Dr. McPhee really added to the humor in the first movie but he just seemed so serious and boring in this sequel. And I thought Owen Wilson's part was kind of disappointing too. Ben Stiller's character just didn't seem as into it as before. I can't quite put my finger on it but there was definitely something lacking.The good the effects were amazing! I loved all the animated characters the moving paintings and how they could go inside them the Einstein bobbleheads and the Jonas brother cupids the black and white Al Capone etc.. One of my favorite scenes was when they went inside the black and white painting. Another favorite was the little arguments between Larry and Brandon Jonah Hill and Larry and Kahmunrah Hank Azaria. Probably the funniest scenes in the movie. By far the best character in the movie Hank Azaria as Kahmunrah. And the lisp was just a genius touch. Another funny but rather unimportant character was Napoleon. I thought Ben Stiller and Amy Adams were cute together. But that's pretty much it. I wasn't impressed by Adams' performance. It was just soso. I mean when has she NOT played a bubbly character? It just didn't seem as... magical compared to the first movie. I was pretty letdown because using the Smithsonian the movie could have had a lot more potential.".

Despite a game cast the jokes fall seriously flat and even worse the script drips with unearned pathos in the middle of the climactic action scene Custer's icky I'm a failure speech goes down as the most dismal attempt at cinematic plaintiveness this year.

I liked its whimsical and fun take on the whole concept but thought it just became too repetitive as Larry returned to the museum night after night to basically do the same things. This sequel solved the problem of repetitiveness. It's based around the events of a single night  this time at the Smithsonian  but it goes overboard in other ways.The basic story is that the exhibits have been moved from the Museum of Natural History in New York to the Smithsonian Archives in Washington. Knowing what this will lead to Larry again played by Ben Stiller  who's now a successful inventor  heads off to Washington to try to keep everything under control. This being the Smithsonian of course there are a lot of exhibits and they all come to life and for reasons I didn't fully understand even some things outside the Smithsonian come to life like the granite statue of Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial. This time though the sense of fun and whimsy is largely gone which is a real loss and a serious battle emerges between the good guys led largely by the group from the first movie supplemented by Amelia Earhardt and General Custer along with Lincoln and a group of evil ones led by Egyptian King Kahmunrah backed up by Al Capone Ivan the Terrible and Napoleon. Frankly the battle goes on far too long and becomes rather dull as well as just plain silly by the time it's over. There are some good things in this. Hank Azaria's lisp as Kahmunrah was funny at first although it did get a bit tired after a while Octavius riding into battle on a squirrel got a chuckle and one has to say that Amy Adams was cute as a button as Earhardt. Still that's not enough to save this sequel. 310".

I gave it 410 for some interesting visual effects for Robin Williams wonderful again as Teddy Roosevelt and for the breath of fresh air brought by Amy Adams in a role that's beneath her. But Ben Stiller who isn't a stellar actor anyway could have mailed this one in. The thing that really struck me in the theater was the rarity of hearty laughter from the audience  it was mostly occasional chuckles. Inventive comedy is pretty much missing here and heroes and villains alike are simply boring.".

I gave it 410 for some interesting visual effects for Robin Williams wonderful again as Teddy Roosevelt and for the breath of fresh air brought by Amy Adams in a role that's beneath her. But Ben Stiller who isn't a stellar actor anyway could have mailed this one in. The thing that really struck me in the theater was the rarity of hearty laughter from the audience  it was mostly occasional chuckles. Inventive comedy is pretty much missing here and heroes and villains alike are simply boring.";

In fact the whole second installment looks uninspired and uninspiring. We don't feel for the characters not even Ben Stiller's Larry Daley as he tries stir up another frenzy among the animated exhibits. As a sequel it is rather stale because it does not have a plot that is engaging enough for its stunts. The gags are mostly repetitive  like Kahmunrah's lisping Amelia's 'readyforanything' attitude etc. There is never a sense of danger in the proceedings  and Larry's presence in the story seems superfluous.The action remains a comic book adventure  and the mandatory twist at the end merely helps to ease our way out of this juvenile treat.".

Photography and shooting on location in real palaces and old European cities add to the movie and a sort of sticky tune helps too.But what The Black Tulip really lacks is the sense of passion and real heroism American classics of the genre usually transmit this being really odd since most of them are usually located in Europe including France. I think the director didn't make up his mind whether this would be a serious swashbuckler with a touch of humor or a comedy with a touch of serious adventure. So it didn't work neither way.Nonetheless the film is entertaining and worth a watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1789 France a thief known as La Tulipe Noir regaled in black including a black mask and cape is going through France robbing noblemen. This sounds like Zorro or Robin Hood except that the sentence ends stealing from noblemen. Nothing about helping the poor. La Tulipe Noir in reality Count Guillaume de Saint Preux Alain Delon is interested only in getting money and enjoying his clandestine affair with Marquise Catherine de Vigogne who is a married to Marquis de Vigogne Akim Tamiroff.The French somehow believe in La Tulipe as a revolutionary hero. But no one knows who he is. The Chief of Police Baron La Mouche Adolfo Marsillach believes Guillaume is La Tulipe and runs a sword down the man's cheek during an event figuring when he's making his robbery rounds he'll be easy to recognize.Now unable to rob anyone Guillaume sends for his younger lookalike brother Julien Alain Delon to lure La Mouche. Julien is guileless and idealistic not to mention romantic so when he meets Caroline Plantin Verna Lisi a revolutionary he falls for her.Julien soon learns that Guillaume is not interested in being a revolutionary so he takes on his La Tulipe persona to support the revolutionaries. This story is loosely based on a Dumas novel  real loosely from what I understand. I found it delightful and very tongueincheek. It's not as good as the Mark of Zorro of Tyrone Power which had humor but also exciting drama but it was still fun. Delon himself would play Zorro about ten years after this.Delon plays both brothers beautifully Guillaume more macho and tough Julien sweet and innocent. His acting can be controversial because of his staggering almost impossible good looks and a charisma that wipes everybody else off the screen. And let's face it it's usually men who find fault with him. If you've seen Two Men in Town Mr. Klein Notre Histoire and many others he's an excellent actor the winner of two Cesars the French equivalent of the Oscars.Akim Tamiroff and Adolfo Marsillach are fantastic in their roles bringing a good deal of humor to them.This was a nondubbed version with subtitles  you will certainly be let down if you see it dubbed. Very good film.".

Great stuff  a lot of fun.The Ark of Truth was well written and directed and felt like a direct continuation of season 10. The actors continued to do what they do with these characters which is a good thing and the action was very good although they've done better before. As for the special effects I thought they were excellent not 100 million budget excellent but for a straight to DVD movie based on a cancelled TV series they were fantastic.The only gripe I had about it was that they threw in everything but the kitchen sink all of the prerequisite SG1 subplots were there. Paring it down and eliminating one of those subplots might have made the movie a little better Sam and Teal'c don't get quite enough to do in the movie as a result but as it is I still think it's a damned entertaining movie  as long as you've watched the last 10 years of SG1. If not you're going to be lost.Clearly though this was not made to win over new fans. This was made for the fans who have been following the show for the last decade. This was made for the fans who weren't happy about the SciFi channel cancelling the show in a cost cutting move and as one of those fans I am very glad they made this movie. I enjoyed the hell out of it.Finally the resolution of the story is what they've been setting up for the last two years of the series. No major surprises but it was carried off very well.For those familiar with the SG1 series particularly seasons 9  10 The Ark of Truth is highly recommended. For anyone who has NOT seen seasons 9  10 of Stargate SG1 I would advise holding off until you have seen those seasons to put everything in proper context.".

	schema:headline " The Fitting And Epic End Of The Ori Storyline";
	schema:reviewBody "Leaving the Ori storyline unresolved at the end of Sg1's final season the makers of the show give us this film. The Ark Of Truth lives up the hype of fans hoping for an epic end to the storyline that drove the show's final two seasons. Indeed The Ark Of Truth proves to be both an epic and fitting end to the Ori storyline.In fact one might go so far as to assume that the show never ended. From the performances of SG1's members it's just like picking up where Unending left off. In particular Michael Shanks and Ben Browder both get to shine in their roles of Daniel Jackson and Cameron Mitchell. That's not to say the rest of cast doesn't but Shanks and Browder really do stand out in this. The supporting cast does too from Beau Bridges to Sarah Strange from Sarah Strange to the villainous Julian Sands and the absolutely evil Morena Baccarin. The real stand out of the supporting cast however is Currie Graham as Merrick the double crossing IOA supervisor.The rest of the production is also first rate for the film in both writing and production values is epic. There is a scope to the film that wasn't possible for the show on television. The story feels epic taking us from Earth to the Ori galaxy and back again. The story has so much going on though that we don't get to see some of the things fans would like to have seen but we see enough to keep everyone happy. The effects and photography aren't just as good as they were on the show they're better. They go from mountains in the opening credits the ruins of Dakarra and the Altaran city to the Ark itself something that was hard if not impossible for the series to do with even a twopart two of the series. There's also one or two moments that evoke memories of the original movie from years ago and fans should get a smile out of it. There's one other thing to mention the music. The music by Joel Goldsmith is just as epic as the film evoking not just the original Stargate theme by David Arnold but the Germanic chants of the Ori themes and heroic themes for the team. But the real treat of the music is that while it may be familiar you've never heard it played this. Fans of the series won't be disappointed. Everything that made us love the series is still here and thriving.Not to say the film is perfect which it isn't. Some parts of the film don't make a lot of sense such as the IOA's actions. They don't make much sense especially when they resurrect an old enemy from the series in the process. I won't spoil it because it makes for a great plot twist but in retrospect it just feels like padding. There's also the odd flashbacks to the Altarans involving the Ark which while they add some texture really might not have been needed. But these are minor flaws and its hard to find anything without any.In short The Ark Of Truth is a good film. It does exactly what it was supposed to do be both an epic and fitting end to the Ori storyline. It succeeds for the most part though it does have some flaws to it. While nonfans might want to watch the Prelude on the DVD to catchup on all the plot lines going on in the film fans should enjoy it. If this and Continuum the yet to be released second film are to be the final end of Stargate SG1 they will be the fitting end of the series.".

	schema:headline " A fantastic finish!";
	schema:reviewBody "As the unofficial end of the Stargate SG1 series Ark of Truth provides a fairly conclusive wrapup for a lot of fans and also manages to please the crowd who fell out with the show a long time ago. The movie's main purpose is to wrap up the Ori arc started at the beginning of the ninth season and culminating in a spectacular finale here.The plot of the movie is relatively straightforward. Daniel Jackson believes that Merlin's visions may be sending him information about an artifact known as the Ark of Truth a device which can essentially brainwash anyone into knowing the truth. However due to the Alteran belief in free will they refused to use it to restrict the Ori despite knowing that their crusade will destroy planets and ravage galaxies. After Tomin Vala's husband defects from the Ori armies and takes sanctuary at Stargate command the SG1 team makes a decision to take a trip to the Ori Galaxy and find the Ark of Truth in order to brainwash the Priors into stopping their crusade.They find the resting place of the Ark on the planet where the city of Celestis the home of the Ori are located. However an IOA agent accompanying them has a different motive  to construct an army of replicators to destroy the Ori in their conquest of the galaxy. They run out of control and begin to take over their ship. Meanwhile Daniel Vala Teal'c and Tomin learn that the Ori were killed by the Sangraal but Adria Vala's daughter managed to ascend and travel to the Ori Galaxy. She is now the single Orici the remaining leader of the entire Ori contingent and the recipient of all of the power gained through the worship of innocents. Acting on a tight time schedule the SG1 team has to work fast to stop the replicators and power up the Ark of Truth in order to stop the Ori once and for all.The few weaknesses include the relatively overstoic acting on the part of Christopher Judge who seems to exaggerate his expressions nowadays and Ben Browder's overly clownish nature. The scene where he leaps away from the explosion that kills Merrick made me giggle and he seemed to be trying to present a humorous stage presence rather than a professional one. Nevertheless Morean Baccarin as Adria doesn't fail to disappoint.A fun movie and damn better than I expected for the end of the series. Definitely worth buying.".

Yes it was reminiscent of a regular however extended episode of the series  but I don't see why that's a complaint made by so many doom sayers I've seen on various forums and websites. AoT is familiar and I wouldn't have it any other way.Here there be MAJOR spoilers The movie's plot line runs smoothly for the most part. Daniel Vala Teal'c and Tomin Vala's husband who in AoT abandons his duty as a commander in the Ori army and joins forces with SG1 to overthrow the remaining Ori worshippers are the focal point of the story as the team travels via the Odyssey to the Ori galaxy and Ortus Mallum The birthplace of all evil  a ruined Alteran settlement where the ark of truth was created millennia ago by an Alteran man named Amelius. Their adventure leads them to Celestis the city of the Ori where Daniel Vala and Tomin are tortured by the Doci and his Priors and we are reintroduced to Adria. Vala's daughter who ascended in season 10's Dominion has taken the mantle of the Ori who have been wiped out by SG1 using Merlin's weapon 10x14 The Shroud. What follows is a desperate rush to activate the ark which is a formidable piece of technology capable of brainwashing a person or group of people to believe whatever message the device is programmed to convey.One big issue I had with AoT is that I felt the focus was at times unnecessarily skewed. Carter and Mitchell wouldn't have played a key role in the primary storyline and don't  however RCC in an attempt to keep them involved devised a subplot involving SG1's old enemies the Replicators. The Odyssey is overrun and forced to flee their position in orbit around the planet upon which the rest of their team are searching  obviously a device required to enhance the sense of danger for those of the team still planetside. Aspects of the subplot were necessary obviously if for nothing else than to escalate the sense of danger but the Replicator solution is contrived and though I usually dare not say such a thing since it is science fiction unbelievable given what the antagonistic group behind the idea has learned about the enemies the Milky Way has faced in the past ten years or more and the danger that would surely have been reintroducing such a threat to any galaxy. Devoting such a huge amount of time to the Replicators and the efforts of those aboard the Odyssey jolted me a few times out of the action the suspense of what was happening on the planet in the plot that forgive me for saying so really mattered.In typical SG1 fashion Ark of Truth is exciting at times wonderfully amusing and human and a credit to the Powers that Be who were along with the fans deprived of a muchdeserved eleventh season. The performances were topnotch as Stargate has consistently provided over the past decade  regular and guest characters all. It was a shame to see what could have been a fantastic 20 episodes reduced to two hours but SG1 delivers and I wasn't expecting anything less.Stargate Ark of Truth is not a good jumpingoff point for the new or casual viewer  intimate knowledge of seasons 9 and 10 are required and though the lovely 10minute recap viewers can choose to watch before the movie begins does a great job of setting up the foundation for new viewers there's nothing like seeing the two preceding seasons in all their detail before diving in  and I highly recommend diving in.910".

The Stargate humor is still present and despite Richard Dean Anderson's absence in the movie still presents a good laugh. The only reason I gave the movie a 910 is because of RDA's absence and still a 910 on IMDb is superb! However the Ark of Truth is strictly based off of the show's Season 9 and 10 and thus I recommend that you watch those two seasons first.Despite a questionable set on the opening scene of the movie and some minor continuity errors any Stargate fan should not be disappointed and in all honesty the change from TV Series to Movie was surprising but the end result does not disappoint. I can't wait till Continuum!".

	schema:headline " Spectacular space opera in which our protagonists travel throughout the galaxy in search for an ancient artifact  the Ark of Truth to defeat the Ori";
	schema:reviewBody "At the edge of the universe lies a gateway to adventure . This is an entertaining and moving finale to season 10 of the second longest running science fiction television series . A secret military team SG1 is formed to explore other planets through the recently discovered Stargates . The Stargate was located inside at the military installation into the Cheyenne Mountain Complex . This time SG1 searches for an ancient weapon which could help them defeat the Ori and discover it may be in the Ori's own home galaxy. As the Ori prepare to send ships through to the Milky Way to attack Earth  as SG1 travels to the Ori galaxy aboard the Odyssey with Lt. Cols. Carter Amanda Tapping  Mitchell Ben Browder  Jackson Michael Shanks  Teal'c Christopher Judge  Vala Claudia Black among others . The International Oversight committee has their own schemes  being led by Marrick Currie Graham a representative of the IOA the international body that oversees the Stargate program . Finally  SG1 arrive themselves in a distant galaxy fighting two dangerous enemies and to find the old Ark of Truth to unbrainwash the followers of the Ori . Later on  they have to struggle with the Replicators for control of the Odyssey . Replicators are selfreplicating machines that attempt to take over any ship or world they encounter .Splendid episode displays spectacular scenarios  adventures  noisy action and being pretty entertaining  dealing with The Odyssey aircraft undertaking an intragalactic travel seeking for the Ark of Truth to finally defeat the Ori  however  the Ark is in the Ori's Galaxy . The plot is really fantastic as well as bizarre  as the weird Ori are evil godlike beings who gain strength from the worship of their devotees  while the motley crew being guided by the visions of Daniel Jackson  apparently remnants of his shared consciousness with Merlin and SG1 searches for the ark . This is a blending into universe legends  supernatural myths  and astounding sciencefiction . This was the only television series endorsed and supported by the United States Armed Forces  particularly the Air Force . The movie packs stunning array of technical visuals and amazing sequences . Furthermore  a beautifully executed set design with phenomenal production values . Christopher Judge Teal'c and Amanda Tapping Samantha Carter are the only cast members to stay with the series throughout its entire run and consequently to appear in two hundred or more episodes. Several elements and characters from Stargate 1994 by Emmerich and Devlin  also appeared throughout the series and although some retained their original characteristics many have been changed or altered entirely . Although they wrote the original movie on which the series was based Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich refused an onscreen credit. They are credited however in the series of novels based on the series. The SG in the title stands for Stargate which means that the series's title in full is actually Stargate Stargate One .

The picture has an interesting script originally developed for television by Jonathan Glassner  Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper himself  based on characters created by Dean Devlin . It was satisfyingly and well directed by Robert C Cooper . This longtime epsde will appeal to TV saga enthusiasts as well as the neophyte who didn't have seen the episodes . It's indispensable and fundamental seeing for SciFi buffs .The original Stargate 1994 was starred by Kurt Russell as Jack O'Neill and James Spader as Dr Daniel Jackson.

A secret military team SG1 is formed to explore other planets through the recently discovered Stargates . The Stargate was located inside at the military installation into the Cheyenne Mountain Complex . This time SG1 searches for an ancient weapon which could help them defeat the Ori and discover it may be in the Ori's own home galaxy. As the Ori prepare to send ships through to the Milky Way to attack Earth  as SG1 travels to the Ori galaxy aboard the Odyssey with Lt. Cols. Carter Amanda Tapping  Mitchell Ben Browder  Jackson Michael Shanks  Teal'c Christopher Judge  Vala Claudia Black among others . The International Oversight committee has their own schemes  being led by Marrick Currie Graham a representative of the IOA the international body that oversees the Stargate program . Finally  SG1 arrive themselves in a distant galaxy fighting two dangerous enemies and to find the old Ark of Truth to unbrainwash the followers of the Ori . Later on  they have to struggle with the Replicators for control of the Odyssey . Replicators are selfreplicating machines that attempt to take over any ship or world they encounter .Splendid episode displays spectacular scenarios  adventures  noisy action and being pretty entertaining  dealing with The Odyssey aircraft undertaking an intragalactic travel seeking for the Ark of Truth to finally defeat the Ori  however  the Ark is in the Ori's Galaxy . The plot is really fantastic as well as bizarre  as the weird Ori are evil godlike beings who gain strength from the worship of their devotees  while the motley crew being guided by the visions of Daniel Jackson  apparently remnants of his shared consciousness with Merlin and SG1 searches for the ark . This is a blending into universe legends  supernatural myths  and astounding sciencefiction .

	schema:headline " Not as good as I imagined!";
	schema:reviewBody "The last ever episode for Stargate SG1 was one that you could remember forever because it defined the team SG1 as heroic stubborn smart funny and no matter what they had a solution for everything a bit like Mcgyver. The last episode was intense emotional and sad Teal'c is older than everyone by 50 years or something so it seemed like the perfect episode except that they didn't tell you what happened to the Ori. Your hopes are dashed when you find out that the Ori's fate is unknown. You do a bit of searching around when you see Stargate The Ark of Truth. You immediately buy it hoping that this will answer everything. The film is a great addition to the Stargate franchise because it does contain action laughs a weirdkindof story and it is way more longer so you get to watch the fun more than fortythree minutes. The team is still looking at the clues at what happened to the Ori but when they find out that they are not dead they go in search of an artifact called The Ark Of Truth a device which tell the truth about anything if seen by the eyes. Their goal is exactly that but there are others who are after it. The film reintroduces the Replicators back but are they helping the good side or the bad side. The performances are not very different from what you saw in the series but I have to give two thumbs up to Christopher Judge for his great performance as Teal'c Ben Browder for his jokes and slight remarks during bad times never did get to fill Richard Dean Anderson's shoes though Morena Baccarin for her villainous role but she did slack at the end Claudia Black and Michael Shanks along with Amanda Tapping for there integrity and often funny jokes. Beau Bridges was great as well! I was a bit disappointed at the ending because it is so unStargate like and it didn't even have a twist but it did leave space for some more Stargate films. I loved the atmosphere in the film as well especially the part where Teal'c is walking with a wound on his back because that part was really beautiful and the camera angle was perfect. The film should have had an cameo by Richard Dean Anderson because he would have been a relief to see in this film. The film is recommended for anyone who enjoys the series and is compulsory to watch since it tells you what happens to the Ori.The film starts off with the SG1 on the ruined planet Dakara searching around for The Ark of Truth when the Ori appear out of nowhere. A squad of Ori soldiers led by Tomin husband of Vala Mal Doran ask SG1 to surrender and they do. An prior comes between them and when things get heated Tomin kills the prior and gains the teams trust. Later.... SG1 embark into the Ori Galaxy on the ship Odyssey with an International Oversight Committee agent between them monitoring the mission. The agent makes a mistake which puts everyone's life in danger aboard the ship and also risks the failure of the mission. Will SG1 overcome the mistake done by the agent and destroy the Ori or will they perish and let the universe be converted?The dialog is slightly better and funnier than season nine and tens. It is in a way more grimmer than ever. The action is obvious and no different from what you see in the series so to put it straight it sucks. The fight at the end was so messy and weird you didn't even know which one was which. The plot is straight forward and contains no twists damn but enjoy the film for what it is. The music and soundtrack can never get old even if you have heard it 212 times and I loved hearing the metallicsortof music at the beginning. Epic! If you like this I also recommend Firefly stars Morena Baccarin Serenity V Battlestar Galactica and Stargate Atlantis. 7.510".

The first battle between the remains of SG1 and the Ori troops found me cringing with concern in the corner of my couch as perhaps one of the most poorly matched orchestrations ever showed itself.

What follows is a cluster that digs itself deeper and deeper as it goes culminating in replicator man a ridiculous and done to death idea not even worthy of a B grade horror movie. Some where along the away Tealc cops a staff blast then walks a journey over some mountains that would have made Edmund Hillary tired before being healed by an ascended Ancient what the????. Vala swans around in the Ori home base whilst her brain dead ascended daughter dares her to open the ark and goes on walk about maybe baking some cookies for afterward. Vala then releases Daniel etc without resistance where are the priors  at morning tea?. After the Oddesey get multiple Ori ship blasts which it couldn't survive in either of the previous series the 20 cent ending is with us. I never thought I would write comments such as this about the Stargate series but here I am bewildered and disenchanted at the PC. This movies rates with Dracula 3000 which also has a one star rating. Stargate should have finished at end of Series 7 but some how was allowed to linger and now we have this cash cow.

	schema:reviewBody "First up Stargate SG1 in my opinion was one of the best TV series ever! The movie does a good job of tying up all the loose ends and the performances of the cast are as good as we have come to expect of a cast that has lived these characters' roles for up to 10 years.Having said that the movie does exactly what was intended  closure  and nothing more. Since this is a movie and not a TV series I rate it as such and if I look at it as a movie it is an average science fiction movies. The special effects are good but every average science fiction movie has good special effects these days.The story is actually not that innovative over and beyond what we know from the TV series and somehow there isn't a great deal of suspense developing anywhere through the movie. It never gets boring but at the same time it feels a bit like a reunion kind of a let's have a fun movie for old time's sake movie.The ending scene is also a bit cheesy.Note 6 is not a bad rating in my books can check my other ratings  it is slightly above average.".

She did not take initiative and repeatedly emphasized her support role. Sam had no brilliant savetheday ideas and in the end she baked cookies and kissed Cam on the cheek.

Overall the cinematography directing writing special effects and plot were lower quality than most made for TV movies. Ben Browder and Michael Shanks also comment on the fact that the movie fails to fill in the gaps in the plot developed over the last ten years and how it really only focuses on seasons 9 and 10. Unfortunately the only aspects of the story line and character development they did focus on where so overdone that it seemed more like a parody than the conclusion to the series. If nothing else at least I should give them credit for having the foresight to realize that this had no place in the movie theater. On the other hand my expectations are so low after watching this that Continuum cannot possibly do worse well I shouldn't commit to that.

	schema:reviewBody "'Stargate The Ark of Truth' closes the story left open after the series 'Stargate SG1' was cancelled. What we must bear in mind however is that the story it closes only began in SG1's ninth season and only lasted 40 episodes. The main storyline of 'Stargate SG1' was already closed at the end of Season 8 after 174 episodes and I personally would have preferred if the show had ended there. The last two seasons of SG1 suffered a severe dip in quality that runs straight through into 'The Ark of Truth'.The film makes absolutely no compromise for new viewers so I will provide a brief backdrop although even this will be insufficient to understand the film fully. The Ori are beings living on a higher plane of reality posing as Gods and the more people who worship them as such the more powerful they become. A set of similar beings known as the Alterans or Ancients are the only defence against the Ori taking over the Milky Way. However neither beings are able to directly interfere with physical reality and hence the Ori use their religion Origin to have their bidding done by humans. A huge army of followers has created a Supergate a teleportation device that they will use to send a fleet of starships and troops to Earth  where they will convert its inhabitants to Origin by force. SG1 is the primary fivestrong team taking orders from the U.S. Government to counter these intergalactic threats.There was a lot that could have been done with a Stargate film  something that hasn't been seen since 1994  and the fans of the TV show were certainly expecting a lot. This is perhaps why the film begins so badly  it's like they couldn't think of anything good enough to match the anticipation so for safety they picked something completely nondescript. That is a full 2 minutes of mountains and literally nothing to go with the mountains other than music. I do not exaggerate  there aren't even titles or credits. It's like it's trying to be the epic introduction to 'The Two Towers' Peter Jackson 2002  which begins by gliding through the snowy peaks of a fantasy land  but lacking the brevity grace grandeur and beauty. The only thing epic about 'Ark's beginning is the anticlimax.The ultimate downfall of the film is encapsulated in these first 2 minutes the production team behind 'Stargate SG1' had spent ten years making 42minute episodes  they just didn't know how to handle the scale of something featurelength. The whole film feels like an early Season 10 episode with 60 minutes of padding as exemplified by these opening flybys. Why mountains? As the plot reveals the mountains have nothing to do with anything. I can easily imagine a brainstorming session the creative team went through where someone suddenly shouted Mountains! Mountains are epic! Just look at the start of The Two Towers!. Any entertainment production needs to grab you from the outset and 'Ark' crucially fails to do this.What is perhaps most annoying about the introduction besides its sheer tedium is that Joel Goldsmith did indeed provide the film with a grandiose score and it completely fails to make use of it. In the overture a subtle multiinstrumental buildup leads to the familiar but deeper and richer Stargate theme tune which as anyone who has heard it will know has a very clear moment of climax. Indeed in every Stargate production made to date except one or two early episodes this climactic musical note signalled the moment for the display of the title. 'Ark' ignores this and continues flying past its unimpressive selection of mountains.Immediately following the introduction we have a short discussion between some Alterans set millions of years ago when they were human in form. They decide that they cannot use the eponymous 'Ark' as a weapon against the Ori as it is too unethical. Immediately we skip to the present and SG1 is searching for the Ark to use as a weapon against the Ori. Have I missed something or has Stargate quite simply thrown away the very thing that made it stand out from the crowd of scifi productions i.e. philosophically and ethically troubled protagonists? This notion is dealt with very lightly the main character throws some lines at the screen a few times about how the use of the Ark is the better of two evils or that they are in desperate times but this pales in comparison to the Season 5 episode where he literally gave his life to save a civilisation. Why the change? The answer is simple the writers couldn't think of a better solution to the Ori threat and so they needed their characters to be okay with it.Because ultimately what could the solution have been? The show had spent 2 years reiterating that the Ori were a force impossible to reckon with that their technology was superior to Earth's by lightyears and that if Earth ever came into any kind of combat with them they'd be frazzled before they could don their uniforms this overbearing power was a necessity both to create tension and also to make the Ori an even more potent foe than the megaenemies that had just been defeated at the end of Season 8. So when Season 10 concluded and the Ori were on the brink of invading Earth what could the solution have been? War would have been out of the question 40 episodes had demonstrated that negotiation or reason was impossible  we were doomed. Enter the Ark. It is a Deus Ex Machina solution of dizzying proportions and a McGuffin that sends SG1 on a padded hunt for 90 minutes interrupted with improbable enemies. I would have appreciated more creativity than what is effectively looking for a device that has a button reading 'Click Here to Beat the Ori'.".

Mountains are epic! Just look at the start of The Two Towers!. Any entertainment production needs to grab you from the outset and 'Ark' crucially fails to do this.What is perhaps most annoying about the introduction besides its sheer tedium is that Joel Goldsmith did indeed provide the film with a grandiose score and it completely fails to make use of it. In the overture a subtle multiinstrumental buildup leads to the familiar but deeper and richer Stargate theme tune which as anyone who has heard it will know has a very clear moment of climax. Indeed in every Stargate production made to date except one or two early episodes this climactic musical note signalled the moment for the display of the title. 'Ark' ignores this and continues flying past its unimpressive selection of mountains.Immediately following the introduction we have a short discussion between some Alterans set millions of years ago when they were human in form. They decide that they cannot use the eponymous 'Ark' as a weapon against the Ori as it is too unethical. Immediately we skip to the present and SG1 is searching for the Ark to use as a weapon against the Ori. Have I missed something or has Stargate quite simply thrown away the very thing that made it stand out from the crowd of scifi productions i.e. philosophically and ethically troubled protagonists? This notion is dealt with very lightly the main character throws some lines at the screen a few times about how the use of the Ark is the better of two evils or that they are in desperate times but this pales in comparison to the Season 5 episode where he literally gave his life to save a civilisation. Why the change? The answer is simple the writers couldn't think of a better solution to the Ori threat and so they needed their characters to be okay with it.Because ultimately what could the solution have been? The show had spent 2 years reiterating that the Ori were a force impossible to reckon with that their technology was superior to Earth's by lightyears and that if Earth ever came into any kind of combat with them they'd be frazzled before they could don their uniforms this overbearing power was a necessity both to create tension and also to make the Ori an even more potent foe than the megaenemies that had just been defeated at the end of Season 8. So when Season 10 concluded and the Ori were on the brink of invading Earth what could the solution have been? War would have been out of the question 40 episodes had demonstrated that negotiation or reason was impossible  we were doomed. Enter the Ark. It is a Deus Ex Machina solution of dizzying proportions and a McGuffin that sends SG1 on a padded hunt for 90 minutes interrupted with improbable enemies. I would have appreciated more creativity than what is effectively looking for a device that has a button reading 'Click Here to Beat the Ori'.";

Maybe you saw the trailer and thought Night at the Museum ripoff! right after you thought This is a joke right? I will admit that I held all of these accusations against Zookeeper when I entered the theater but one thing I've learned is that preemptive decisions to not see a comedy simply because you think you have a grudge against it is BAD BAD BAD. I can understand if people can't stand Kevin James's frenetic humor IF YOU WATCHED IT but over 400 votes of 1 star a week before the movie is even released shows some shameful attitudes among IMDb voters. Purposeful downvoting is never justified and is especially a disservice to Zookeeper which actually turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Roger Ebert put it best when he said Look a great movie this is not. A pleasant summer entertainment it is. The moments that make an awful comedy awful are the ones when you feel like burying your face in your hands and wishing you never saw a second of this movie. You can all think of those times I'm sure. Personally Zookeeper NEVER gave me one of those moments. The plot was a breath of innocent fresh air and managed to keep me interested in the movie. The romantic tensions in Paul Blart Mall Cop were ridiculously exaggerated but in Zookeeper were quite lowkey. The same goes for Kevin James's boyish frenetic acting James has an inherent likability about him that really carries the weight of the film. Be it puppets animation or real animal movement the zoo animals were impressive as well and sported some convincing lipdialogue sync that you wouldn't expect to find in a movie like this. With a varied cast that will keep you guessing at who voices who the animals are the second great half of the show. This is a family film aimed at innocent happygolucky moviegoers and you know it  so if you're looking at a pleasant and light time at the theater Zookeeper is the one to check out this weekend. But if you want the typical Hollywood explosions then grab three extra dollars and head down to see Transformers 3 in 3D instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you are about to ask me what possessed me in seeing Zookeeper my answer would be curiosity. At first I wasn't sure whether I wanted to see Zookeeper. The cast in general didn't appeal to me apart from Nick Nolte and Rosario Dawson and the trailer in the cinema when I went to see Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 had me cringing.When I eventually dragged myself to see Zookeeper I was overall very unimpressed. Is it the worst movie of the year? Not quite that would be either Big Momma 3 River of Darkness or Spy Kids 4. But it is low on my films I saw in 2011 list.I know Zookeeper is a family movie I get that. But in my book just because it's a family movie doesn't automatically mean it's a good movie. Just for the record I love family movies some of my favourites are family movies such as Disney Pixar movies like The Wizard of Oz The Secret Garden A Little Princess Chitty Chitty Bang Bang ET Black Beauty and The Black Stallion. Zookeeper just isn't my idea of a good family movie that's all.I love family movies that touch you and reach out to the child within you and also ones that appeal to a wide audience. Of course Zookeeper isn't that type of movie but family movies can also entertain. I admit I raised a smile once or twice mainly because of Bernie the Gorilla and the movie didn't make me cringe as much as its trailer did but overall Zookeeper just didn't entertain me.Firstly the writing is pretty much a mess. Not only is the script poorly written and a vast majority of the gags predictable and cringe worthy but to me the humour would go over the heads of most kids and adults would find it childish.The storyline is also incredibly predictable and while some of the final act felt rushed a lot of it because of the humour not working felt dull. Not only that it is very unoriginal not always a problem but seriously just how many times have we had the Dr Doolittletalking animals idea? I did like some of the scenery and the animals do look great. The editing however could've been much tighter. The music is forgettable and doesn't always fit with the mood and the direction is plodding and unfocused.I do wish there was better news about the acting but sadly no. I am not a fan of Kevin James though I wasn't going to let that spoil the movie experience. However because his character so clichd and material so weak James tries too hard and overdoes it badly. Rosario Dawson is pretty much wasted in a thankless role.The animals are in a way more interesting than the humans they look fine and their material somewhat funnier. Voice work is more problematic some do decently but some grate fast. Adam Sandler and Maya Rudolph are incredibly irritating while Sylvester Stallone sounds bored. Cher tries her best but her character is not among the most interesting. The best and the only one I really did like was Nick Nolte as Bernie.Overall messy and doesn't work in my opinion. 210 Bethany Cox".

Alas I was only partially rewarded. The animals far outshine the humans in this movie and the TGI Friday's scene is where the animalhuman connection is at its best I never had a night like that at TGIF! but the human story is all too familiar and the characters can only try to raise a script that fails to add anything new to the cinematic landscape. Overall a decent effort a few chuckles but nothing new. And two people near me commented that Ken Jeong's typically icky character was totally unnecessary for this film.".

I found this movie to be a really good one catchy story and a nice romantic touch to it.Initially I was a bit worried with the talking animals part fearing it might have turned into another Dr. Dolittle spin off but Zookeeper was nothing of the sorts. The talking animals just added a sense of comedy and a good amount of personality to the movie. So do not dread this aspect of the movie.The story is very compelling and moving. Zookeeper Griffin Keyes played by Kevin James is dumped by his girlfriend Stephanie played by Leslie Bibb on a very wellplanned and romantic setup. Years later Stephanie reappears in Griffin's life and things are turned upside down. But who is Griffin now where is he supposed to be and how will he get there to be with the love of his life? This is the major line of the movie then there are lots of nice sidelines to the story as well.Zookeeper has a good cast and the chemistry between Kevin James and Rosario Dawson playing Kate is really great. And the animal voices are done by a group of great people as well. Nick Nolte as Bernie the gorilla Adam Sandler as Donald the monkey eventhough he sounds like he just had his entire mouth shot full of tranquilizers in this movie Sylvester Stallone as Joe the lion Cher as Janet the lioness and the list goes on and on.I had feared that Adam Sandler was going to be allshadowing in this movie but his role was only a supporting one. Yeah I am not much of a fan of his work. So I was personally relieved to find that Kevin James was the one pulling the load of this movie.Zookeeper has a good amount of comedy in it as well and I was laughing aloud a good number of times throughout the course of the movie. And for those of you who like romance then Zookeeper has that as well. I liked the storyline because it was a albeit somewhat stereotypical romantic comedy. But it all worked out well for a greater unity.This movie will entertain children and adults alike because there is something in this movie for everybody. If you haven't seen Zookeeper already then get in gear and sit down to watch it.".

And... what a great treat to have about two hours with good natured humor back to back jokes and humor that gives you lots of giggles  but not a crackyouup laughtillyoucry movie. Not meant to get an Academy Award but it made me smile and feel good about going to the movies again at age 42. Look this movie was worth the 8 to see in a theater. Really glad I went to see it.

I laughed the missus laughed and hey my parents laughed as well as the kids. Yes it's a silly premise but it is fun. Some people need to just chill sit back and enjoy these movies and not take movies too seriously. Just have fun like the guys who made this movie cause these kinda movies take me back to being a kid. Kevin James is his usual funny self Joe Rogan is hilarious in places but only a few of the animals are really hilarious. It was an enjoyable movie. I don't understand people hating on these type of movies. I do understand the hate for 'vampires Suck' and 'Epic Movie' and 'Disaster Movie'. those are horrible movies that shouldn't never come to fruition. So I would say go and watch this cause it's fun.".

How anyone can do that is beyond me because it's not as if it's the first day of knowing that fella but so it goes and painted the picture of someone after wealth and status which according to Griffin's soon to be married brother Dave Nat Faxon is something a woman like Stephanie would prefer. A job offer at his brother's exotic car showroom would mean Griffin leaving a job that is his calling and the animals of the zoo have to plot to ensure Griffin stays to care for them.And that meant an accidental revelation that they can all speak English fluently and possess a keen sense of humour sort of spending plenty of time bickering than to come up with concrete plans to help our protagonist and even then offer tips more suited for the animal world which allows for some pretty awkward moments though firmly kept in family friendly territory. In some ways it's similar to Night at the Museum with the museum pieces coming alive at night and in the same vein the animals gather in town hall like fashion when the last patron and caretaker leave the premises to partake in some idle chatter.Voiced by recognizable folks such as Nick Nolte as the emo Gorilla Bernie who might be more suited in Rise of the Planet of the Apes Adam Sandler as Donald the Monkey Sylvester Stallone as Joe the Lion who fantasizes about being king of the jungle Cher as the Lioness Jon Favreau and Faizon Lowe as a pair of Bears and Maya Rudolph as Mollie the Girraffe and a whole host of other voices you'd come to expect that there would be at least some wisecracking animals to liven up the mood and add to the sporadic laughter caused from a rather tired narrative but tough luck there was too little of that.Instead what we got are the usual rote narrative development where Griffin painfully tries so hard to regain the affections of someone so undeserving and shallow though some may argue it's natural selection like in the Animal Kingdom where the mate will choose from the strongest of her suitors with Griffin being in competition with yet another braggart ex boyfriend Joe Rogan of Stephanie's. In some ways it touches upon contemporary strategies usually involving another hot woman and Griffin's choice to induce jealousy is that of his fellow zoo coworker Kate Rosario Dawson whom you can stay 10 steps ahead to know how what should be roleplaying would turn out to be.With an ensemble such as the underused Ken Jeong as Venom the reptile house zookeeper and Donnie Wahlberg as the token keeper with a sadistic streak both of whom should have seen more screen time Zookeeper is what you would label as an average family entertainer playing it very safe just like how one would view a zoo exhibit encased behind a rigid structure that provides plenty of the same and none of the surprises.".

	schema:headline " Zookeeper Cages Itself";
	schema:reviewBody "Kevin James isn't without talent. His years spent on The King of Queens were entertaining and for a certain demographic provided exactly what the doctor ordered. Translating to the big screen James had a memorable performance in Hitch while seeming to pull enough likability and charm out of roles in movies such as The Dilemma and Paul Blart Mall Cop.The latter Paul Blart was a monster hit winning the box office in its opening weekend with 32 Million despite being barely watchable. Zookeeper follows in this same tradition with James doing his best to act within a poorly directed poorly executed lackluster effort that disappoints for both kids and adults.Kevin James plays Griffin a zookeeper who excels at his position. Though he loves his work a failed proposal to Stephanie Leslie Bibb in the opening sequence causes Griffin to consistently wonder what his life would be like with the girl he wants instead of the job he loves. When Stephanie comes back into his life five years later Griffin is determined to get Stephanie back despite the consequences of changing himself the life he loves and the job he was born to do.Leslie Bibb puts a lot of her comedic chops to work in a role with no meat on the bone. Her Stephanie is a one note song but Bibb manages to make her seem as if he she has motivations that are somewhat sincere if utterly wrong for Griffin. Despite Bibb's best efforts the writing never lets her character escape past her cheap plot device to give Griffin a catharsis that he doesn't have to change who he is to find love.Where will he find that love? In fellow coworker Kate Rosario Dawson of course. As Kate a vet who works with Griffin Dawson also brings loads of personality and charisma to a character that is about as interesting as a dissertation on Guam's current economic importexport climate no offense to anyone in Guam or the importexport game for that matter.Gauging Zookeeper is best done by relating it to its peers. Dr. Dolittle which carries much more similarities than the talking animal aspect was a much more concise and well constructed effort than Zookeeper ever has a chance of becoming. While the animals in Dr. Dolittle are able to provide more than canned laughter for adults their action provided visual stimulus to keep the kids happy throughout the runtime. Dr. Dolittle also lets the animals do most of the physical comedy which proves to be the most effective method to reach kids and adults for that matter.Another production of similar value is Night at the Museum which I personally hated. At least Night at the Museum had the decency to get into the meat of the action within a few minutes. Part of the real issue with Zookeeper is how long it takes to actually get to the animals talking. Then once they do they don't do much else except talk. Then when they talk most of the humor is above the kids and embarrassingly devoid of anything adults will find of value. The dialog as bland and pointless as it gets. For example Adam Sandler plays the monkey who essentially screams Throw poop at her! for minutes at a time. Other animals don't provide much else except for horrible dating advice which proves to be the shtick for the middle act. While James is able to get something out of these gags even his physical comedy can't save the bits from being dry and without a point or reason. Zookeeper doesn't use the crux of the entire movie the animals talking  to actually further the plot or advance a character proving to be one of the cardinal sins it commits.When Zookeeper finally wraps up the first grade reading level of a plot honestly Curious George books feels like a convoluted thriller compared to Zookeeper there's really no point to have gone on the journey. Zookeeper is a sloppy and apathetic effort in every aspect including cinematography costume design set design and oh yea plot humor and message. Overall For the adult in the audience Zookeeper will provide a few grins interlaced with moments of disengagement irritation scoffing and finally sleep induced drooling. For kids Zookeeper takes nearly thirty minutes to get the animals talking and once they do they don't do anything but attempt to entertain the adults.Despite concerted efforts from Kevin James Rosario Dawson and Leslie Bibb Zookeeper cages itself from the outset.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anyone that goes into a summer movie from Adam Sandler's production company with talking animals and a comedy actor star simply has to take responsibility for their own actions and their own reckoning process if they are not satisfied. They must stop moaning in public immediately that a formula movie followed its formula as it is unseemly and illogical to do so.My goodness! This is not Syriana nor an Ingmar Bergman movie nor something Sir John Gielgud would have been tempted to act in. This movie is a perfect example of its genre a silly warmhearted folly with a moral at the end. This much should be obvious to anyone who has ever entered a cinema before.I noticed a few rather grumpy audience members writing that they were shocked shocked! that the talking animals were not real and the jokes were puerile. One viewer even complained that the relationship between the zookeeper character and the gorilla was not realistic Huh? It's a talking gorilla! It's a guy in a gorilla suit while another guy voices the words from a recording booth. Of course it's not realistic Hahahaha!.Kevin James has not been my favourite actor I will admit. But I thought he did a fine job here. Much better than I had expected after having seen his Paul Blart Mall Cop In my humble opinion that was lame. James does seem to be a decent bloke in real life and a lovely man. We all know a few comedians who have a veneer of a smile but bad vibes underneath. Those few can give off a snarky or malicious vibe on the chat shows or even DVD commentaries a bit of the weasel rumbling around in the real actor just underneath the character on screen  but not James. I was not in the least repulsed and actually liked him in this.The animals were a hoot. I only could guess two voices out of the 15 nor 20 in the zoo scenes. The others were a surprise but completely logical when I read their identities on IMDb.You can safely ignore the selfrighteous naysayers to this bit of fun. That is if talking animals are to your taste in a lighthearted and goofy summer comedy.".

Therefore Director Frank Coraci Click centers the film around Smith's slapstick comedy to salvage a poorly written script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn Norbit. Horid scriptwriting commences as James's character Griffin Keyes proposes and rejected by his girl friend Stephanie Leslie Bob Iron Man 2 solely on the basis that he was a zookeeper. Five years later he is more dedicated than ever to the zoo animals but is still trying to get over her. He has a new woman in his life named Kate Rosario Dawson Unstoppable an animal doctor at the zoo but is too infatuated with his past to read the signs. Meanwhile Griffin is trying to connect with the zoo's Gorilla Bernie but is having no luck. Stephanie then reenters his life looking to change Griffin once again. Griffin is determined to do anything to win her back. However she is in a complicated relationship with a man named Gale Comedian Joe Rogan causing Griffin to have to compete for Stephanie's attention. He has no idea where to start until the animals at the zoo give him advice after breaking their biggest rule of not talking to humans. With a little added help from Kate he gets very close to changing his personality for good but realizes in the end that he is meant for bigger and better things. Ken Jeong The Hangover Part II and Donnie Wahlberg CBS's Blue Bloods also star as zookeeper in this film.James has the clear stand out performance but is strongly supported by an allstar comedic voice cast including Nick Nolte Bernie the Gorilla Adam Sandler Donald the Monkey Cher Janet the Lioness Sylvester Stallone Joe the Lion Judd Apatow Barry the Elephant Jon Favreau Jerome the Bear and Faizon Love Bruce the Bear. Each animal is personified entertainment in their own way however the pair of bears conjure the most laughs. Kids will enjoy the childish predictable plot while older viewers will only be interested in the unlikely friendship that forms between Griffin and Bernie the Gorilla creating a hint of sentiment in the film.With two of the worst scriptwriters in Hollywood responsible for its screenplay it is not a surprise that after the exposition of the film there isn't any reason to pay attention to the story. Henceforth the conclusion is inevitably predictable but Director Coraci evidently wanted to telegraph it even more. Leslie Bob's poor acting and portrayal of Stephanie as a horrible human being make it completely obvious that Griffin will never be with her. The biggest indicator of mediocrity comes in the form of The Hangover and Community favorite Ken Jeong as he skates through the movie on the track to pointlessness.First Mall Cop now Zookeeper brings up the question of what odd profession James will tackle next.

Oh and I also liked that whole scene with James and that gorilla at TGI Fridays. So on that note Zookeeper gets a high recommendation. One more thing it's fun to guess which animals' voices go with whatever celebrities before the credits reveal them and I had no trouble recognizing Sylvester Stallone Cher Maya Rudolph Adam Sandler and Don Rickles who the friend I mentioned thought was dead. I asked him how he thought he died when he was in Toy Story 3 last year. Cause he's old was the reply which I replied by asking if he still thought Mickey Rooney was dead this was when we saw that Ben Stiller movie Night at the Museum. He knew that wasn't true. Oh and this was the first time I found out about Sandler's wife Jackie making a cameo in one of his movies Adam is one of the producers if you didn't know.

One that stands out in my eyes is Adam Sandler voicing the monkey which happened to be the funniest animal in the film. The story is very familiar and ends up being very predictable but any movie these days are hardly original anymore.As other reviews say it is a family movie and tends to aim for the kids entertainment but there is still some things for the adults.

After that he did them quite regularly.Broken Arrow was made first but held up over a year before release so Winchester 73 was actually Stewart's official return to the west. But both films had a lasting impact on his career.This is the story of Army Captain Tom Jeffords who with a simple act of kindness started a peace process with the Apaches led by their charismatic leader Cochise. Jeffords a veteran of the Union Army and the frontier wars is heartily sick of the slaughter he's witnessed and participated in. He finds an Indian boy who's been wounded by whites and he tends to them and heals him.One thing leads to another and pretty soon Jeffords finds himself in the camp of Cochise with whom he strikes up a friendship. He also woos and wins an Apache maid named Sonseehray. Jeffords and Cochise with General Oliver O. Howard make a treaty with the Apache at least most of them.Broken Arrow did a lot for James Stewart but even more for Jeff Chandler who plays Cochise. Cochise was a man in his late 60s when this was really taking place but Chandler in his prematurely gray hair portrays him well. Chandler got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for Cochise. Jeffords and Cochise are men of good will and decency who see an honest peace as the only answer. Of course both have to contend with people who won't or can't accept peace with the other race. It's those people and what they do break the peace that is the rest of Broken Arrow's story.Delmar Daves is a good director of western films and in fact did another film about the U.S. government trying to make peace with another Indian tribe the Modocs in Oregon in the film Drumbeat. He gets good results out of the rest of the cast. Note the performances of Will Geer as an Indian hating rancher Debra Paget as Sonseehray and Basil Ruysdael as General Howard.The screenplay was done by Albert Maltz of the Hollywood Ten. How ironic that Maltz was blacklisted after this film. I suppose a film about peace between the races and good will towards one's fellow men was highly subversive.Broken Arrow was given much acclaim for being the first film to express the view that Indians were something more than bloodthirsty savages. That's not exactly true other films around that time started saying the same thing. Nevertheless Broken Arrow's message is an eternal one. Says so in the Scriptures if I'm not mistaken.".

Cochise and Stewart's character have a relationship which grows from mutual respect to a true friendship as they try to work out peace between the whites and indians.

The film contains agreeable depiction about Indian customs as it actually was including dancing complex mythology and peculiar culture . The movie is shot in Cocominto Mountains of Arizona with marvellous outdoors. Excellent performances by James Stewart and Cochise with scars on his face caused by previous crash car. Interesting screenplay by Albert Matz though credited as Michael Blankfort but he was blacklisted. Evocative and imaginative score by Hugo Friedhofer. The motion picture is well directed by Delmer Daves.

Taking upon himself to aid the boy it's not long before the Apache show up intent on killing Jeffords by way of the war instincts. Pleading for Jeffords' life the boy manages to get him spared by the Apache chief Cochise. It's the start of a friendship that may just bring and end to the war and peace across the west.Tho not the first social Western film made Broken Arrow it can be argued is maybe one of the most important and telling genre films of the 50s. Showing humanist portrayals of the Apache and dealing out level headed tellings of the relationships between whites and the Native Americans Delmer Daves' film is as relevant today as it was back on release. Adapted from Elliott Arnold's novel Blood Brother the story follows Jeffords a measured and fine James Stewart as he attempts to broker peace between the warring factions. Firstly by convincing Cochise Jeff Chandler bang on form to allow the mail run thru the pass something that brings suspicion and calls of Indian lover from Jeffords' own kind and then to finally set up a peace pact at a time when violence and hatred was rife in the west.As the friendship between the two men grows Jeffords and an Apache girl fall in love beautiful Debra Paget as Sonseeahray thus giving the story a further jolt of momentum. The screenplay then really hits its stride as Daves and his crew pit peace and inter racial love against a backdrop of bloodshed and savagery. Never glossing over just how hard peace is going to be Broken Arrow retains intelligence and a sensitivity even as breakaway factions from both sides for example we see Geronimo split the Apache and form a renegade front are intent on killing off the peace process. It even has time for deep emotional kickers to reinforce the point of just how tough and unlikely peace and tolerance can be sometimes.Broken Arrow was and still is a bold picture. In fact it can be argued that for the likes of Daves and Stewart it was at the time very bold and risky career moves. But it paid off because the film stands up today as a picture of some distinction. It's themes and approach to its subjects are something that this generation and all the future ones will always find to be socially important. Boosted by Hugo Friedhofer's luscious score and taking advantage of the Lone Pine location shoot Broken Arrow is a fine fine film that even non Western fans should be looking to absorb. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1950 and directed by Delmer Daves Broken Arrow stars Jimmy Stewart as a former soldier Tom Jeffords who saves an Apache teen after ten years of war between settlers and Natives in 1870 Arizona. When the boy's elders extend him mercy Jeffords sees the Apaches as human beings rather than faceless enemies for the first time and becomes the mediator between the warring factions. Jeff Chandler is stunning as the Apache leader Cochise but Debra Paget only 16 yearsold during filming looks too whitebread to be believable. I love Debra but casting her in this role is eyerolling. To the film's credit several of the peripheral Apache characters are played by Native Americans including Jay Silverheels and John War Eagle. The emphasis is on the Apache way of life and the movie is touted as the first proIndian Western proIndian to a point but this simply isn't the case. Buffalo Bill with Joel McCrea came out six years earlier and it was clearly favorable toward the Natives. Broken Arrow just goes a little further in this direction. Regardless it is amazing to view Westerns from this long ago that are evenhanded regarding the Indian Wars honestly portraying the Natives as hostile and formidable but also with respect to their perspective and way of life. While obviously dated in some respects both Buffalo Bill and Broken Arrow stand the test of time and remain entertaining and even enlightening to this day. The movie runs 93 minutes and was shot in Arizona but also Iversion Ranch  Alabama Hills California.GRADE B or A".

	schema:headline " Ground breaking Western";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an excellent movie thematically ground breaking for its time. A model for many Westerns to follow especially in terms of using the19th Century IndianWhite conflict as a metaphor for modern African American civil rights. Note watch for the prequel The Battle of Apache Pass filmed two years later with Chandler and Silverheels reprising their roles as Cochise and Geronimo.Here's what I likedThis kicked off a decade of great James Stewart Westerns. This was the beginning of Stewart establishing himself as one of the top leading men in the history of Western movies. Interesting that Stewart plays the role of peacemaker in the film. Stewart was a highly decorated bomber pilot in WW2 and was deeply traumatized by his exposure to death and destruction. After the war he vowed never to star in a film that glorified combat. This is in stark contrast to John Wayne who dodged service in WW2 yet went on to star several times as a war hero.Albert Maltz who wrote the screenplay was blacklisted as a Communist. The struggle to stop the ApacheWhite conflict in the movie is a metaphor for the increasing tensions of the Cold War. Maltz' theme indeed was leftist as the good guys Cochise and Jeffords are trying to prevent war i.e. conservatives of the late '40's were preaching an activist military approach to stemming the spread of Communism.The movie is generally historical accurate. Jeffords was a real person who did many of the things James Stewart does in the movie. I'm not bothered by the small historical inaccuracies which are more than justified by artistic license.Nice to see Jay Silverheels playing the militant Geronimo since he was stereotyped later as the Uncle Tom Tonto in the Lone Ranger TV series.Nice location shooting in Arizona. Sedona isn't really where these events took place but close enough. Stunning scenery more than justifies slight inaccuracy.So that's what Arthur Hunnicut looks like without a beard.Here's what stopped the movie from being betterThe whole thing's a little stiff and hokie. Jeff Chandler was OK although I don't understand how he got an Oscar nomination for the role. I really don't get why they cast pure Caucasians in these roles especially Debra Paget. Even if we assume that there were not enough trained Native American actors in 1950 there were any number of Hispanic actors who could have played this role more credibly. Stewart is 41 Page is 16. I know it was especially common in the 1950's to have large age differences between leading men and ladies but this is way over top. Frankly it's statutory rape.The movie needed a better characterized heavy.No comic relief. Little Big Man is still the only solid Indian point of view movie I've seen with a few laughs thrown in.".

	schema:reviewBody "Starring my personal favorite actor Mr. James Stewart and featuring superlative performances from Jeff Chandler  Debra Paget Broken Arrow is a fine Western that transcends the conventional attitude of Native Americans being nothing more than mere savages. This film takes a closer look at the culture of the Chiricahua Apaches in the Rocky Mountain region the scenery of which is beautifully captured on celluloid. The story is about one brave white American named Tom Jeffords Stewart who risks his life by riding into the Apache stronghold led by the natives' champion of truth and honor Cochise brilliantly portrayed by Chandler. Jeffords' vision is one in which whites and Apaches can someday live together like brothers and this is why he wishes to visit the great warrior Cochise. Cochise is no fool he can see through the insincerity of men but sensing the honesty and earnestness of Jeffords' vision Cochise slowly warms to the idea of peace for which a broken arrow becomes a symbol hence the picture's title. In the meantime Jeffords falls in love with a beautiful young Apache woman named Sonseeahray Paget which means morning star.The following are my favorite sequences from Broken Arrow please DO NOT read any further if you have not yet seen this wonderful picture. The music score by Hugo Friedhofer reaches a nice crescendo as Tom Jeffords rides directly into the Apache stronghold while all the grim natives surround him with weapons Riding into the heart of potential danger as Stewart biographer Jonathan Coe expressed it. In stark contrast to this quiet intensity is a scene in which the boisterous white townspeople of Tucson raise quite a ruckus as they drag Jeffords out of a saloon and prepare him for a soontobeinterrupted lynching. Following several days of Tom's healing a wounded fourteenyearold Apache boy Tom is quite lucky to escape with his life as other Apaches who spied on him fire a few arrows This white man is my friend! shouts the boy. And the very final shot of this movie however abrupt it may be depicts Tom riding away in the wide open country as his heartfelt voiceover narration confirms his unshakable memory of Sonseeahray.In Broken Arrow the character played by James Stewart is fairly mildmannered and likable. AFTER Broken Arrow however Stewart would receive the opportunity to further stretch the limited patience of his Western characters reaching the borderline into sheer ferociousness!".

	schema:reviewBody "In the film Broken Arrow the members of the Apache tribe were portrayed as smart and fair people who had some of the same ideas and morals as the Whites. The film begins with the main character Tom Jeffords healing a wounded Apache boy. When the Apache boy is departing after being healed his father greets Jeffords and the boy with the intent to kill. This scene shows the fairness of the Apaches when the boy's father says You did not kill we will not kill this time. Although the boy's father had the intention to kill Jeffords he didn't kill him because Jeffords healed his son instead of killing him. This shows the Apaches' sense of fair play stated later by Jeffords They wanted to kill me alright but they let me go. I learned something that day Apache women cried about their sons and that Apache men had a sense of fair play. This also shows Jeffords' learning that the Apaches have the same emotions as the Whites. Jeffords realizes that the Apaches act the same as the Whites after the Apache boy describes why he must get back to his mother. 'My mother has cried' he said. Funny it had never struck me that an Apache woman would cry over her son like any other woman Jeffords thought. The film also suggests that the Apaches had a sense of intelligence. In the scene when Jeffords begins his journey to meet Cochise he sends a smoke signal with Juan Juan then notes that Apache eyes are quick. This symbolizes the intelligence of the Apaches because although they can't be seen they're always on the lookout for oncoming attacks. Meaning that they are aware of the possibilities of malicious attacks from enemies. One of those sneaky attacks occurs when Col. Bernall planned an attack and ultimately failed. Col. Bernall states that he has 50 rifles in hiding under the blanket that looks like mail. However Cochise outsmarts the Col. Bernall and sends his men to circle the military men shoot them and steal their wagons. This scene shows that the Apaches were smarter than the Whites.Although the film noted the intelligence of the Apaches the film did consist of scenes that negated it. The first scene that Sonseeahray and Jeffords meet privately Sonseeahray is seen admiring an object that she's never seen before a mirror. She grabs the mirror and inspects it with amazement then says This is much better than looking through a pool of water. This is ironic because in an earlier scene the Apaches are seen communicating with each other by reflecting sunlight off of a mirror. The film attempted to acknowledge some of the strong suits of the Apaches but didn't fully captivate all of their qualities due to the racism still present in this time period. Racism is shown throughout the plot and through the way the film was directed. The use of white actors are prominent in this film none of the Apaches are truly colored. All of the actors are coated in brown makeup because the director Delmer Daves didn't want to cast colored people. Daves didn't want to cast colored people in this film because they still weren't seen as truly equal during this time period. In fact Jeff Chandler who played Cochise is a white sergeant in another film named Pillars of the Sky in which he rescues the Indians from the cruelty of his associates.As in Pillars of the Sky Broken Arrow depicts that the Whites were always the people seeking to negotiate a peace treaty with the Native Americans. This fictional film depicts Jeffords seeking peace instead of the Apaches this essentially suggests that white people were always partial while the Apaches were always ready to kill instead of seeking out peace. When Jeffords first asks Cochise to allow the mail to pass by the Apache territory Cochise hesitates to allow this and says I will not listen after Jeffords asks Is it not possible that someday your people and mine can live together as one people? This shadows the truth that the Whites in fact enticed the war between the Native Americans and the Whites.".

Former soldier and Army scout Tom Jeffords Jimmy Stewart is out riding the hills doing a little gold prospecting. He comes across a young Apache lad suffering from a shotgun wound. He tends to the boy's wounds and helps him heal up. Several days later a party of Apache show up. It is all the lad can do to stop them from doing in Stewart. The lad tells the leader Jay Silverheels that Stewart had saved his life.Silverheels lets Stewart go with a warning to never return. Stewart then witnesses the same group ambush and nearly wipe out a small group of prospectors. Stewart returns to town with this tale. Stewart decides that this war needs to end. He has a tame Apache teach him how to speak Apache along with their customs etc. A month later he rides off into the mountains where Cochise Jeff Chandler has his stronghold. The two meet and talk out a minor deal to let Pony Express riders through Cochise's territory. It is the first move towards peace. This effort is not met with joy from everyone. Some of the townsfolk think the only good Indian is a dead Indian. Cochise also has a few malcontents who only want war. When a group of Army troops gets a rather sound beating for trespassing on Apache land it looks like fullfledged war is going to start up again. However the U.S. government has sent out General Howard to make a treaty. Howard Basil Ruysdael is known as a straight shooter who keeps his word. Ruysdeal convinces Stewart to take him to see Chandler to begin talks for peace. Stewart arranges the meeting. Chandler is not all that inclined to believe a Blue Coat. Stewart tells Chandler that he trusts the General. Rules and terms are pounded out and it looks like it will work. Needless to say a group of Apache led by Geronimo Jay Silverheels decide to continue the fight. While all this has been going on Stewart has fallen for Apache maiden Debra Paget. Stewart wants to marry the girl who feels likewise towards Stewart. Chandler points out all problems that might arise from such a joining but Stewart is determined to close the deal. The treaty is a success with the odd hicup caused by the Apache renegades and some settlers out looking for gold on Apache land. The wedding between Paget and Stewart goes off and the two seem very happy. Several weeks later a lad from town is brought into the Apache camp. He was found on Apache land. The boy Mickey Kuhn is the son of the leader Will Geer of the Indian haters in town. Kuhn says that two of his young ponies had been stolen and he tracked them to Apache land. Chandler says that if this is true he will see they are returned. Chandler Stewart Paget and Kuhn head up the trail to where the pony tracks lead into Apache land. It turns out the whole thing is a plot to lure Chandler out of camp. 78 men led by Geer are waiting to ambush Chandler. Stewart spots the play and tells Chandler to beat it. This he does but not before dispatching a few of the gunmen. Stewart stands his ground and likewise accounts for several before going down in a hail of lead. Chandler returns with some braves who set off after the remaining ambushers. He finds the wounded Stewart crying over the body of Paget. She had caught a few bullets during the battle and was killed. The death of Paget deepens the bonds of friendship between Chandler and Stewart. Stewart now rides off into the sunset. This film was one of the first to treat the North American Native as something other than brutal savages. It tries to play fair and equal when showing the mistakes and hatred that came from both sides in the conflict. Also in the cast is Arthur Hunnicutt John Doucette and Iron Eyes Cody. Iron Eyes Cody was from Louisiana and of Italian decent. He moved to Hollywood changed his name and pretended to be Native Indian. He appeared in several hundred films and TV shows playing a Native. It was not till the 1990's that it was discovered who he really was. This very fine western was the first of a series of westerns made by director Delmer Daves. Daves was a writer producer and director.

Instead of AmericanIndians being onedimensional and bad or stupid here they are real people and the complexities of the relationship between them and the rest of America is actually considereda rarity in 1950s Hollywood.The movie begins with Jimmy Stewart playing an exscout out West during the latter portion of the 19th century. He happens upon an injured Apache teen and nurses him back to health. Most Whites would have probably shot him or left him and Stewart's kindness had a huge impact on the boy. So later when they are captured by Apaches the boy begs them to let Stewart goas he is their friend. A bit later Stewart realizes that his own perceptions about Indians changed through meeting and spending time with one so maybe he reasons he can learn the language and customs and act as a bridge between the two clashing cultures. Eventually he goes to live with the Apaches and slowly gains their trust and a strong friendship with their chief Cochise. There's a lot more to the film than this such as his relationship with an Apache lady but this is just something you'll have to learn about by seeing the filmI don't want to spoil it.Overall an amazingly sensitive portrait of AmericanIndians and a film that tried to show the common ground between them and the rest of America. A lovely film that I really enjoyed though the film did seem to end a bit more abruptly than I might have liked. Still it was probably the best portrayal of this group since the 1920s and 30s with films such as THE VANISHING American and THE SQUAW MAN.".

JThe role of Jefford's in the peace treaty and his personal bravery seem fairly accurate though his motivation may have been less simple than is portrayed here and as is typical from Hollywood the love interest has also been created. The message about finding a peaceful solution through our similarities is unfortunately tainted by the ultimate failure of the treaty and the treatment of Native Americans.Unfortunately despite the sympathetic portrait of Native Americans both of the primary native characters are portrayed by Caucasian actors.

	schema:reviewBody "The real history of the Indian fight with the white in US is an issue to study. Hollywood always showed the Indians as the bad boys I am saying here what has been also asserted by other actors like Marlon Brando and Jack Palance and I agree with them. Now this film seems different but not so deep it goes shallowly into the problem but it is a film different from others touching the Indian problem. Cochise was in fact a good politic and not only a fighter he understood well that the end of the war with whites would have been the extermination of the Apaches and for that reason he decided to make the peace with the white. Was the peace reasonable and fair for the Indians? I do not think so. In this film it is shown that the Government of US was only giving a territory of 50 square miles to the Apaches a misery compared to what they had before the colonization. In addition Geronimo is here shown as a criminal and somebody hating the whites again I do not think this Apache boss was like that. Every person is a product of the environment where he lives faced problems etc. So showing the hardfighting Geronimo as the bad boy is not fair with the history. The film shows the initiative of Tom Jeffords James Stewart to make the peace with the Apaches it looks to me very innocent the way this problem was treated and how easy it was to 'convince' an already convinced Cochise of the need of peace. I know that the screenplay of this film was made by the writer Albert Maltz whom I personally respect because of his work and novels but the film did not go deep into the problems showing to what extent the whites were responsible for this war with the Apaches. May be Hollywood can remake this film with more historic and fair information about the Indians in the coming future.".

	schema:headline " A Groundbreaking 50s Film by a Blacklisted Writer!";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all this is a groundbreaking film from the early fifties about racial tolerance and peace disguised as a beautifully scenic Technicolor western starring James Stewart Jeff Chandler and Debra Paget. Then it turns out to have been written by Albert Maltz one of the original Hollywood Ten who was blacklisted for not naming names at HUAC the House Unamerican Activities Committee hearings in the late forties. It was a dramatization of a true incident in American history when in 1872 Tom Jeffords played by James Stewart helped negotiate a peace treaty with Cochise Jeff Chandler the Chief of the Chiricahua Apaches. Several elements are historically accurate including Jefford's lone ride into Cochise's camp the mail riders the presence of General The Christian General Howard and most intriguing of all the portrayal of Apache life.The tension and distrust of warring nations seeking peace is a problem both the 'Americans' and the Apaches try to resolve. Jefford's realization that Apaches like other nations want merely to be left in peace and wage war only to protect their own is contrasted with scenes of Apache cruelty towards whites. Indians are not just presented idyllically as 'noble savages' but are subject to the same forces that pull men to war. In spite of these murders and Indians attacks that he sees and hears about Jeffords trusts the Indians to be men of honor and seeks treaties with them. Jeff Chandler plays Cochise with strength nobility and a touch of tenderness. No wonder he was nominated for an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor. So striking was he that he played Cochise in two more films.To further the theme of brotherhood Tom falls in love with and marries a young Apache girl Sonseeahray played by a 16 year old Debra Paget with perfect skin undeveloped body and white teeth that blind you when she smiles. We can see her 'in full flower' in Roger Corman's great 'Tales of Terror' 1962 and 'The Haunted Palace' 1963 as well as in 'The 10 Commandments' 1956. She also had stand out roles in Fritz Lange's two part film released here as 'Journey to the Lost City' 1959 and 'The Indian Tomb' 1959 and of course in Elvis Presley's first film 'Love Me Tender' 1956.'Broken Arrow' uses the two stories  the inter racial love affair and the quest for peace  to develop its theme of tolerance. You won't see a positive treatment like this in another film of the 1950s! Only a handful of films then confronted racial hatred though often in a negative way such as the mind boggling first teaming of three between Richard Widmark and Sidney Potier in 'No Way Out' 1950. 'Broken Arrow' won a Golden Globe that year for 'Best Film Promoting International Understanding'. Maltz also wrote the Frank Sinatra plea for tolerance short 'The House I Live In' 1945 containing the title song that both Sinatra and Paul Robeson continued to sing the rest of their careers. Another wonderful aspect of the film is the deeply color saturated Technicolor photography particularly of scenic Arizona. The cinematography was also nominated for a Golden Globe and an Oscar. Some of the composed landscape shots are priceless.Other little bonuses we get Jay Silverheels playing a strong willed Geromino instead of the meek Tonto. He played Geronimo in two later films as well. And there is the deep voiced Basil Ruysdael who plays General Howard. He started his career as an opera singer at The Met and was a radio announcer for 'Cavalcade of America' in the late 1930s  and can be seen as Andrew Jackson in the 'Davy Crockett' 19541955 films of Walt Disney.Then there's James Stewart who looks here like he was born on a horse. Except for making some flippant hand gestures he does a good job. I first saw this movie when it came out I was about 7 and was impressed by the way the Indians were shown and especially Debra Paget. Now I can see how wonderfully constructed this film is and how it was years ahead of its time as an 'adult Western.' I'll give it an 8.P.S. I shouldn't spoil it by telling you that the peace treaty only lasted until 1875 when the Chiricahua were forced to move to a reservation since the 'Americans' wanted the copper and silver on Apache land. The renewed war continued until Geronimo's surrender in 1886. So much for the brotherhood of man.".

We can see her 'in full flower' in Roger Corman's great 'Tales of Terror' 1962 and 'The Haunted Palace' 1963 as well as in 'The 10 Commandments' 1956. She also had stand out roles in Fritz Lange's two part film released here as 'Journey to the Lost City' 1959 and 'The Indian Tomb' 1959 and of course in Elvis Presley's first film 'Love Me Tender' 1956.'Broken Arrow' uses the two stories  the inter racial love affair and the quest for peace  to develop its theme of tolerance. You won't see a positive treatment like this in another film of the 1950s! Only a handful of films then confronted racial hatred though often in a negative way such as the mind boggling first teaming of three between Richard Widmark and Sidney Potier in 'No Way Out' 1950. 'Broken Arrow' won a Golden Globe that year for 'Best Film Promoting International Understanding'. Maltz also wrote the Frank Sinatra plea for tolerance short 'The House I Live In' 1945 containing the title song that both Sinatra and Paul Robeson continued to sing the rest of their careers. Another wonderful aspect of the film is the deeply color saturated Technicolor photography particularly of scenic Arizona. The cinematography was also nominated for a Golden Globe and an Oscar. Some of the composed landscape shots are priceless.Other little bonuses we get Jay Silverheels playing a strong willed Geromino instead of the meek Tonto. He played Geronimo in two later films as well. And there is the deep voiced Basil Ruysdael who plays General Howard. He started his career as an opera singer at The Met and was a radio announcer for 'Cavalcade of America' in the late 1930s  and can be seen as Andrew Jackson in the 'Davy Crockett' 19541955 films of Walt Disney.Then there's James Stewart who looks here like he was born on a horse. Except for making some flippant hand gestures he does a good job. I first saw this movie when it came out I was about 7 and was impressed by the way the Indians were shown and especially Debra Paget. Now I can see how wonderfully constructed this film is and how it was years ahead of its time as an 'adult Western.' I'll give it an 8.P.S. I shouldn't spoil it by telling you that the peace treaty only lasted until 1875 when the Chiricahua were forced to move to a reservation since the 'Americans' wanted the copper and silver on Apache land. The renewed war continued until Geronimo's surrender in 1886. So much for the brotherhood of man.";

I really like Tommy Wirkolas ability to combine homage with something new and interesting not a very easy thing to do folks!Dd sn is basically a teenagerslasherhorrorcomedy with Nazizombies. The storyline is pretty basic it's about these teenagers that go up to a cabin in the mountains in the middle of winter and get ambushed by a punch of zombies. Yeah you know the drill But this one really delivers and all the clichs are used to benefit the film. You can see a lot of influences from past genre movies and it is filled with homage towards them.

Not too mention a dude with a blooddrenched chainsaw behind the head. I'm not the biggest fan of horcoms but I was really interested in this one because of the whacky premise. So was it a blizzard of bliss or a storm of suckage? The story revolves around a bunch of medical students getting away for some rest and relaxation during the Easter break. Unknown to them they've set up camp at the absolute wrong place. Back in the day evil Nazi's used these hills for an escape route or safe haven way back when and it's said that this is where they supposedly holed up and eventually died. Well they ain't all that dead. They look it but they ain't dead. Our medical students eventually meet these bloodthirsty German maniacs and the red stuff starts flowing. A mad dash for survival ensues and it all ends up being a 'hail' of a lot of fun.The flick isn't perfect as it suffers some from small horror clichs like dumb decision making. But at the same time they handle these clichs in a somewhat refreshing manner. Some cheap scare tactics are used early on to get you on edge but those are barely used later on when violence and creative gore take hold.Dead Snow really surprised me. I wasn't expecting such a fun flick. The characters were all wellfleshed out the dialogue wellwritten and funny the gore aplenty the horror nods abundant and awesome Braindead tshirts?! and even the score and soundtrack were good.

If this shouldn't be possible try and gather as many friends together for a drunken movie night but whatever you do don't watch this cheerfully repugnant and positively demented movie all by yourself as it is too much of a crowdpleaser! The formula of laughevoking zombie splatter movies isn't new even Nazi zombie movies have been done before for example Shock Waves and Zombie Lake but spirited and ambitious young filmmakers never cease to invent original variations on the sub genre. Norwegian director Tommy Wirkola took his cast  crew high up north for a splatter film in a beautiful and isolated snowy setting. A group of medical students  that are also diehard horror movie freaks  trek to a remote mountain cabin for a weekend of snow scooter fun drinking and casual sex. The first night of their arrival already they receive a visit from a mysterious and grumpy old local who tells them a grotesquely absurd story about sinister events that occurred in the area near the end of WWII. The atmospheric tale says that fed up villagers combined forces and chased their Nazi occupants into the mountains where they all froze to death. The clique laughs away the warnings but subsequently discovers a box of old coins that promptly resurrects an army of Nazi soldiers in a far developed state of decomposition. The first half of Dead Snow is slowpaced atmospheric and full of little tributes to classic zombie movies particularly The Evil Dead movies. The students are standard horror stereotypes including the nerd and the blond bimbo and thus the first half also contains childish pranks and gratuitous sex sequences. As soon as the Nazi zombies emerge however Dead Snow is a nonstop spitfire of blood gore and intestines. Apparently the production of this film required 450 liters of fake blood and that isn't nearly so surprising if you watch the end result. There's chainsaw action decapitations rope pulling with intestines axe murders machine gun concerts and disembowelment. The effects are topnotch in spite of the obvious budgetary restrictions and the make up art on the zombies is very impressive. The rotting uniformed corpses look quite menacing especially their leader. The snowy landscapes are beautiful picture to behold although it's even more amusing to see the white snow color red with blood! Tommy Wirkola is a clearly talented director and hopefully a promising long career awaits him.".

Well perhaps it could have gone a little further in some spots. The Nazis are decked out in their military garb suits and helmets but only a handful have the swastika armbands none with Hitler mustaches and only once does a zombie Col. Herzog perfect name by the way actually utter a phrase which is ARISE for his horde of solider to stampede after the hapless teens. The rest of it? Nope nothing much to complain really.The director is Tommy Wirkola and he's done something I didn't expect going in he made a movie that is shot with a level of competency that goes a couple of notches above just simple Bmovie twaddle or rather he doesn't rest solely upon it. Indeed some scenes like when characters are buried under feet of snow or someone goes out into the dead of night there's a dread that can be comparable to the recent film The Descent. It's a well made movie that happens to be about 55 of the time as campy and goreriffic as anything one's seen this year outside of the Japanese Tokyo Gore Police school. On top of this there's a clever twist on horror conventions one of the characters is a movie geek Evil Dead and Friday the 13th are mentioned and the tropes like having sex and then getting killed or the stranger who explains everything early on and then gets slaughtered first are chalked up royally... and then come the Third Reich.Oh it's such a blast Dead Snow is. At first you get immersed with the characters even if they are only marginally interesting or compelling and then when it comes time for these medical students who apparently have such mad skills at it they can do things like wield weaponry and sew up their body parts when need be kick major ass. This movie is made for people who want a good solid zombie movie that combines comedy tension and enough ridiculous motions to go a long enough way to make things always entertaining. It's almost a study in how to uplift past conventional crap into something artful and electrifying. It's also cheesy and stupid and a bucket of crazy when it can get to that point I mean Colonel Herzog come on! Bottom line pair this with and the other midnight movie festival hit Hysterical Psycho and you got a smashing double feature.".

	schema:reviewBody "Move over Saw Jigsaw may have rocked your minds with his puzzling murders but if you thought a movie couldn't get much higher on the gory scale you couldn't be more wrong. Turns out that Norway's Tommy Workola pretty much tops the gore charts with his hair raising gag inducing loseyourpopcornonyourlap thriller Dead Snow. The perpetrator of all of this gore? Oh you guessed it those elusive and pesky zombie Nazis. Virtually losing all plot twenty minutes in this Nordic flop brings you back to or the glory days of those 80s slasher movies. Remember the classics such as Killer Klowns from Outer space or everyone's favorite Frankenhooker? It's a stitch! ..Yeah me neither. Dead Snow is just about as forgettable. With the same plot as practically every teen movie ever made the director pretty much HAD to use something as outrageous as blooddrooling zombie Nazis. Dead Snow's character Vergard played by Lasse Valdal even says it himself How many movies start out with a group of friends going to an isolated cabin!? And that is exactly where this tale starts. Eight Norwegian medical students take a spring break okay this is also the most overused plot sequence to an isolated cabin for some relaxation in the form of sex and massive amounts of alcohol consumption. The bulk of the plot all four minutes of it comes when Vergard stumbles upon a chest no not even a chest. A better word is rather small shoebox. in the floor of the cabin while he is looking for some lost beer. The group somehow decides that it's theirs and they're going to be rich from the grand assortment of 10 coins that they found. This treasure chest looks more like it could possibly fund the group's next trip the liquor store but the screenwriter has the balls to insert an Indiana Jones quote here Fortune and glory kidsfortune and glory. Yeah right.Next we hear a strange noise from outside the window a strange old man enters disses the hippie girl's organic coffee and chastises the group for not reading up on the local history of the area before coming on their grand vacation. Now I don't know about you but if I'm headed on a spring break to a desolate mountain to drink and flirt with cute Norwegian boys the last thing I'm interested n is the history of a 20person shantytown. Plot fail. This crazy old man goes on to tell a story about Germany's occupation of the area during WWII stating that the Nazis treated the Norwegians poorly. Sick of the oppression this small town of stoic mountain dwellers organizes a revolt killing 300 of the Nazis. I'm a little curious about what kind of weaponry they scrounged up to overtake an entire trained army.But anyway this whole plot consumes the first twenty minutes of the movie. From here on out you lose all objectivity of any sort of direction this story is going. So here is where every mistake ever made in a horror movie is somehow wrapped up all in one real thriller. Now is probably a good time to mention that one real sporty and adventurous girl decided to ski to this cabin by herself through this virtually unnavigable snowy mountain region of Norway. Wonder who dies first!?!? Cue the zombie Nazi infiltration of the movie through the cabin windows where these merciless creatures pull girls into outhouse poop rip off heads pull intestines out and you the lucky viewer even get to see a brain fall on the floor of the cabin. Half way through this fiasco these ever so intelligent medical students Why didn't they make them state school fraternity members?! They must not exist in Norway. apparently forget that the zombies are attacking through the windows so they just chill by them again. And OH you guessed it another one bites the dust. You're just starting to scream at these imbecile characters when they break the number one cardinal rule of horror flicksyou NEVER split up and God forbid you NEVER split up boys and girls. But hey the director must have figured he was already 10 feet out without a paddle so why not??Now there's more zombies more running more limbripping terror. It starts to get real excessive when you realize that there's 5 minutes left and absolutely nothing has been resolved. I just about got up to leave when the ridiculous finale kept me wondering how this movie ever even made it to theaters. If it wasn't apparent in the rest of this review I do not recommend this movie to even the biggest fan of gore movies. Please save your five dollars on this one you'll be better off taking a nap than wasting two hors of your life on this bloody awful flickand no I'm not British.".

Early 80's shockers Zombie Lake and Oasis of the Zombies proved that this subgenre needed a lot of work. Moving on to the present day and we have Norwegian film Dead Snow. The question therefore has to be have things improved in the past 30 years? Well marginally at best.Maybe Dead Snow could more accurately be described as a TeenNaziZombie flick seeing as its protagonists are students on a holiday in a remote cabin. You can probably guess from that last line that this film isn't exactly original. It's not remotely scary either. But at times you aren't really sure if it's being played for laughs or not although I guess that was most probably part of the intention. Horrorcomedy is a hard one to pull of however and this film essentially shows why. It's effectively neither one nor the other and you are left thinking 'meh'.The characters are so negligible that you really can't care about them. And occasionally they do things that are highly irritating i.e. does anyone really think that there is a chance in hell that a hot girl is going to enter a toilet and willingly have sex with a fat man who is in the process of wiping his butt postdump? Eh no? Please. Again it may have been intended as a joke? I dunno maybe it's those long winter nights in Norway that has led to a somewhat strange and misguided sense of humour. Anyhow the Nazi zombies do eventually turn up in numbers but they seem to be computer generated which takes away some of the threat as it's difficult to create genuinely scary monsters with cheap CGI. They are perfectly serviceable for a low budget horror picture to be fair but I'm just not much of a fan of CGI and prefer proper make up and physical effects.This is throwaway stuff but it might entertain fans of modern horror films I guess.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw this film I was unaware that the zombies portrayed in this movie weren't normal zombies. Instead as I recently discovered on IMDb they were a Norse version of walking corpses called draugr. Once I realized this it started making more sense as normal zombies usually don't have the intelligence to use things like binoculars. Neither do they have the motor skills to do anything but essentially walk very clumsily and devour people. These zombies run. And while that isn't necessarily new it also isn't necessarily standard. Not only that but they follow orders from a leader and stab people. Repeatedly. Anyway once a person realizes this isn't a normal zombie film I think they might be able to accept the fact that the normal rules don't apply and therefore make allowances if necessary in order to give the film a fair chance. That said the film had some good parts and it had some bad parts as well. First it is being billed as both a comedy and a horror movie. It is actually neither. I didn't find it very amusing at all. Ridiculous would be a better word to describe it. Likewise I didn't see much horror in it. Yes there was lots of goreand while that is certainly normal in any zombie movieI found the graphics were a poor substitute for actual horror. So perhaps a better description might be to call it a splatter filmbecause that's what it is. Second I believe more attention should have been focused on building up the characters because although the actors did okay I would have much preferred to have someone to cheer for and hope he or she manages to escape. Unfortunately this was not the case. I must confess though that I found the scene where Liv Evy Kasseth Rosten woke up and found herself being gutted somewhat of an artistic touch. I also liked her solution to the problem. On the flipside though I thought that the amputation scenario was just plain stupid. No doubt some folks thought it was humorous. But I thought it really lowered the film's value. Same thing with the idiotic outhouse scene. Totally asinine. Third I noticed that several people have given this movie very high marks. It even won an award for Best Feature Film at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival. That's fine. But even though it injected some new possibilities into the zombie culture I found it very disappointing. It wasn't funny it wasn't scary and the ending was too predictable and unsatisfying. In short the film had some good resources to draw from Very nice alpine scenery and a cast that the director Tommy Wirkola could have probably gotten more out of if he had given them a better script to work with. Instead he took a different approach and went for cheap laughs and graphics. It's a shame that he did.".

By taking this approach and creating a movie that has been rightfully compared to the Evil Dead series the Norwegian filmmakers have successfully done what Eli Roth has failed at time and again created an entertaining horror film that will truly stand the test of time if only for its absurdity.The only issue that I have with the film is that due to the nature of my initial viewing among 280 something diehard fans who were yelling and groaning along with me throughout the entire movie as well as at Treevenge the equally absurd short film shown before it I now fear that should I get the opportunity to see this film again it won't be able to live up to the enjoyment of that first viewing.".

The result is undeniably fun and goes some way to prove the theory that originality isn't absolutely necessary just so long as you have chainsaw dismemberment and shotgun action.

He's fascinated by Sex Pistols and gets Johnny Rotten as his guiding star  to hate everything. All with support. Is it possible to make an uproar when all you get is support?Jens Lien Director of The bothersome man and Johnny Wang has made another interesting story of maladjusted men in Norway. This time he goes back to the late seventies to describe a period in the life of Nicolaj based upon the biographically inspired novel Teori  Praksis by Nicolaj Frobenius.It's done well. Lien knows how to interest the viewer. the casting is great and the actors are all doing a great job. There's lots of laughs especially around the mad and free spirited father. Sven Nordin is perfect in his role. as is smund Heg as Nicolaj. The time capsulizing of the late seventies is great until Johnny Rotten himself turns up in a dream playing himself in a cameo  obviously 30 years older than he is at the time. Fun to have him there  but maybe CGI would have helped a little here?The film is very enjoyable but still I really feel the film ends up in no conclusion. Great plot but where does that leave us?Well maybe this is the way a life goes but still  we'd wish for more to get a perfect film. Still there's lots to enjoy here. Maybe even scenes you'll remember for a long time. Gosh  I'd really wish this film could have made it all the way. If you enjoy a fun story and love punk you'll get much out of this. But it's not all feelgood. There's too much seriousness lying behind too make this innocent fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw this at the 2012 Palm Springs International Film Festival where director Jens Lien was on hand at my screening for a QA following the film. The film is set in 1978 where Magnus Sven Nordin and Lone Sonja Richter are a new age couple raising two boys. Magnus is an architect by trade and is in a transition stage between being a hippy and a new age trend setter. His loving wife Lone puts up with his eccentricities and is the glue that keeps the family stable. A family tragedy propels the oldest son Nikolaij smund Heg into being a follower of the punk rock scene where he joins a band and rebels on the establishment of his hometown. Magnus goes through the family crisis on a different course following a nervous breakdown. This is a smart and funny comedy with a heavy sprinkling of drama to keep it on track. Norway has become known in recent years for the quirky comedydrama films coming from there and this is a good example. Great directing by Lien from an excellent story by Nikolaij Frobenius. Fine acting performances from a great cast and nicely photographed by cinematographer Morte Sberg. Masterfully edited by Vidar Flatauken with a great score and sound this is a worthwhile coming of age film. Look for former Sex Pistols front man John Lydon as his alter ego Johnny Rotten in a cameo and a soundtrack featuring six original Sex Pistol classics. I would recommend this imaginative film and give it a 9.0 out of 10.".

To make a short story a bit longer a happy leftyalternative family is shattered up when the mother is killed by a runaway driver. The youngest son goes away to live with friends of the family the father becomes even more eccentric and the previously somewhat soft elder boy turns to being a punk all this to the backdrop of staid 1970ies Norway.What could have been a tragicomedy turns out to be neither really a tragedy nor  unfortunately  really a comedy. And it is a long shot from the quirky Scandinavian comedy that I expected. While I liked many of the actors especially the leads Sven Nordin as Magnus the dad and Asmund Hoeg as Nikolaj the wayward son and the film's setup at least it's not your usual hippie movie plot about a bunch of carroteating stoners the plot is mostly erratic and incoherent. It just didn't do it for me. Magnus is an architect and comes across the idea of building a revolutionary glass house  in the late 1970ies when this idea was already several decades old. Or Magnus has loud sex in a nudist camp although this would usually result in him being kicked out nudism is not to be confused with freelove activism. All this gave me the impression that the filmmakers quickly ran out of ideas and were desperately trying to kill time before rolling the credits. The end of the film sucks as well by the way. Other directors such as Marcus H. Rosenmller have made much better tragicomedies about similar topics e. g. Summer In Orange.".

In an older type theater like the one I went to you can hear the reel going through the projector at times. I loved that. The movie does not keep you busy with music nor effects it lets you reflect upon what is happening.There is a lack of rhythm that generates an atmosphere that is fascinating an utterly enjoyable. The same kind of atmosphere generated by Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut. Not for all people.I would highly recommend it to fans of cinema as the cinematographic work is amazing. Those that base their appreciation of a movie solely on the story will be utterly disappointed. It's the kind of story that you have to make up the links in your mind afterwards. My version of it is pretty darn cool but probably quite offtrack! If you do go catch the movie there is one very cool part when the two cops are talking to each other on their cell phones. An ultracool sound effect that really puts you in the moment. Hats off to the person that thought of doing this.".

Tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a deer's sufferings on the road. Throughout the struggling he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over him.Not spooky but very mysterious and well played movie.

When Alex demands of his doctor why his personal circle is behaving in completely contradictory fashion we hang on his every word. You are picking up on their deeper feelings is all the doctor can offer. Evidently he's as baffled as any of us. Alex does have a breakthrough of sorts when he penetrates a deep memory that had nothing to do with him going into a coma but occurred about 34 years earlier. Er as I said...it's baffling. Other biggrossing and awardwinning pictures have had ludicrously unsatisfactory denouements e.g. Clint Eastwood's Mystic River but Memoires Affectives takes the cake. How the director managed to persuade the producers to finance this confusing confection is not clear. Probably Roy Dupuis could appear for 90 minutes asleep in bed and someone would cough up a few million.

	schema:reviewBody "I like thoughtprovoking films and this is one of them. The story is about a man who wakes up from a coma and remembers nothing. In search of his own memory he seems to develop an uncanny ability to steal memories from his loved family and friends. He does it unintentionally of course as images of their memories flow into his head as they describe them to him. Afterwards they forget these memories and act as if these memories never exited and this phenomena frustrates the man throughout the film. Someone viewers complained that the ending has nothing to do with rest of the film. I interpreted it as Alexander must remember who he is what happened to his father on that hunting day in order to stop stealing memories from his loved ones. Whenever the memory transmission happens you can hear a faint clicking sound the opening scene when his wife told him she is going to marry Francois the gas station scene when his daughter told him that he's the best father in the world the scene when he toasts for friendship with his best friend the scene when his wife told him she will always love him the scene when his girlfriend told him we were in love and the scene when the gamekeeper told him about the case of gin. I was looking for that clicking sound during the final scene with his brother because I wasn't sure if these images are his brother's or his. There was no clicking sound his brother's memories was not stolen based on the fact that his brother confirmed what happened verbally after Alexander gained that memory. Alexander was able to break his own curse by finding out the one memory he desperately wants to forget the one memory that defined who he is. However I am not sure how he stole the memories of the Indian hunter and the deer. Maybe he stole the deer's memories right when he got hit by the truck you know it is a big truck because of the sound of horn in the opening and maybe the deer had the Indian hunter's memory when it encountered one. In the end we still don't know who hit Alexander but I don't think that was the point of the story.".

The rape of the disabled girl was no different than the physical and psychological abuse of the two boys by the jocks.

Would there be more than two people to explode on the last day? The end result was very predictable and a cautionary tale of what is allowed by school officials and the result of overpopulated schools.Bottom line this was an interesting and engaging movie and Uwe Boll did a very good job of telling the story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Heart of America released in Australia as Home Room is a well acted and finely crafted film. Uwe Boll tackles a most difficult subject matter with a grace and subtlety that you would not expect from the director of Alone In The Dark and House Of The Dead. Somewhat predictably Uwe's armchair critics have been sharpening their knives over this film as well. Do these people have anything better to do than rant about a relatively obscure film director's shortcomings? Don't be put off by Uwe's undeserved reputation as the king of crap Heart of America is a great film.Heart of America is one of several films to be inspired by recent high school shooting tragedies. This may sound like a perverse topic for Uwe Boll to examine given his subsequent devotion to making gory horror movies. However Boll has crafted a surprisingly intelligent and thought provoking film. More impressively Uwe succeeds where the likes of Gus Van Sant have failed  unlike Elephant Heart of America actually makes for interesting viewing. By treating this theme within the context of what appears to be a straight forward teen drama Boll allows viewers to get to know the characters before plunging into tragedy. This makes the eventual outcome all the more affecting.One of the few complaints about Uwe Boll that carries some validity is his tendency to overlook any kind of character development. This makes the in depth character study in Heart of America all the more satisfying. The lives of both the shooters and the victims are explored which provides a balanced insight into the circumstances that can lead to such inexplicable events and puts a human face to the perpetrators of such acts. The film is interestingly constructed revealing a group of very different but equally unhappy and disillusioned teens. One reviewer described these characters as stereotypes and I could not disagree more. The characters are almost hyperreal. The drug dealer might look like an extra from The O.C. but the bullied teenagers the frustrated teacher and the perplexed principal are all wonderfully realised. The acting in the film is mostly outstanding. Once again Boll has collected a fantastic cast  Juergen Prochnow and Michael Pare are at their very best. It's nice to see a cameo from Maria Conchita Alonso as a school counsellor and Boll regular Will Sanderson is great as the town loser. The younger actors are mostly fine with the exception of the pregnant girl and the wooden Barbie doll playing the principal's daughter.The film works best when exploring the lives of its teen characters. The scenes of bullying and the flashback to the rape of a disabled girl are bleak gritty and powerful. The look on the brother's face as he hears his idolised sibling recount the rape is devastating. The film loses its way occasionally what was with the secretary and her bizarre hand gesture to celebrate the last day of school? but everything is held together by slick editing and a very clever script. I have always enjoyed Uwe's unique directorial skills and he outdoes himself here. I can't wait for more computer game adaptations but after seeing this I hope he squeezes another hard hitting drama into his schedule.Heart of America is a riveting film that deserves a bigger audience. This film is eloquent and thought provoking while still managing to be interesting and entertaining. This movie should be judged on its merits not the subsequent films of its director.".

	schema:reviewBody "I know Uwe Boll loves to read how people view his movies on IMDb so I will address this to him. Mr. Boll I'm a film student at Temple University this is my third year. I'm studying not only writing and directing but also film theory and criticism so I'll go through the problems I see in your film as I watch it for the third time.Editing For starters the text that begins the film adds nothing. Yes these statistics pertain to the events depicted but this is something for a news broadcast not a movie. Next the subtitles denoting the time are the worst possible way to denote time changes. With editing time change is inferred... this is called an ellipse. Your audience is smart enough to figure this out on their own. Since the fact that it's the last day of school is mentioned twice in the following scene it does not need to be put on the bottom of the screen. The ending statistics are useless and things most people already know and aside from this it's hardly a punchy ending for a movie.Directing I have to insert the score under this title because it has to go somewhere. The metal that brings the movie to a start is WILDLY inappropriate. It's the kind of thing that belongs in an action movie and if you're trying to glorify the events in question your sickness extends beyond your inability to appropriately handle a movie. The girl reading the note aloud in her house is unnecessary see Editing. The set design for her house setting up that she is from a welloff family is excellent but I have your production designer to thank for that. Regardless of the pregnant girl's first scene being handled well in writing she looks at the camera. This is not a French New Wave movie and since you're going for straight narrative this is terrible. When the abusive father is discussing his son's 'new job' the camera cuts from the father to the son then pans across then cuts again. This happens over and over and it's very disorienting. The scene where the little mentally retarded girl is positively excellent and this I must give you props for it. It's far and away the best scene in the movie when the soundtrack the acting the writing and the directing is all together. Shortly thereafter things start to fall apart again. The voiceover when the girl is reading her poetry during her drug trip is confusing and bad. The killings themselves are built up with pounding music and shot as violently as possible my conclusion is that the act is being glorified. Again if this is true that you feel these young people were right in committing their murders you are truly a sick individual. The credit song is also wildly inappropriate.Writing The kid repeating the curse words is just gratuitous. No child talks like that and his parents would discipline him if he did. Any message about adults having no control over their children or being susceptible to their environments is lost because of how clumsy this is. Clint Howard's dialogue is not believable and he would be much more sadistic if his control were implied rather than weak and verbal. When the two teachers are discussing the abusive teacher's inability to write the dialogue is more than obvious and all of it can be inferred via subtext. Life does have useless conversations but people don't go to films to see this played out. If the selfish boy wanted to have sex with the principal's daughter and she didn't put out he would have left her. He gives no reason why he wanted to stay with her. The intelligent drug dealer is given decent dialogue except his sarcastic remarks such as you can at least say Simon says and he handles it well. The problem is that this whole sequence adds nothing to the film. Neither the teacher nor the student learn anything. When the bullies start beating up the outcasts it's too brutal. I've never seen anything like that happen and I've never seen or heard about people who act like that it's insertion seems to be for nothing more than shock value. The main bully's arc is the most satisfying in the story he's the only one in the story who conveys an appropriate range of emotions. By the way his older brother should not just come out and tell him that these kids are going to be the kind of people the bullies wish they were. Part of these kids being bullies is not realizing this fact. In other news if the abusive teacher were acting this way he would simply not be a teacher. Part of the curriculum required by law to be able to teach children is knowing how to handle them. A writer can't simply take up a teaching job in public school without credentials this only happens at the college level.OriginalityThe albino girl's first drug freak out is straight out of SLC Punk. Each of the teenagers in the movie falls into a stereotypical category of teenager. The pure girl and her impure boyfriend the pregnant couple the torturous jocks the drug dealer who's intelligent the social outcasts. The albino girl's second freak out is taken from Requiem for a Dream.By the way some people like me own your movies to watch and make fun of. I realize you're laughing all the way to the bank as a result but I'm perfectly happy shelling out five bucks for a used movie and there are plenty of yours at video stores and spending the rest of my life showing it to people as an example of what not to do and you can't put a price tag on that kind of entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Uwe Boll isn't exactly a name I praise very highly actually his movies 'House of the dead' and 'Alone In The Dark' are 2 of the worst movies I've seen.He does get it right occasionally though with for instance 'Rampage' and 'Assault On WallStreet' oddly enough both those have a similar theme of massshootings as this one perhaps that's a subjectmatter that Uwe simply connects with the most and thereby where he shines the most in doing.I have no idea why this is so low rated I think it could have to do with 2 things1.

	schema:reviewBody "In Uwe Boll's commentary on the DVD of Alone in the Dark he brags about how Ron Howard liked Heart of America. I really have to wonder what Ron was thinking. Some might think of this film as bold for taking on the hot topic of school shootings but others including me think of it as a travesty for badly dramatizing it. It is an intriguing important topic but I've never seen a film successfully tackle it No I'm not a fan of Elephant. I was in high school when most of the school shootings were happening so I feel a kind of connection to the subject.This film follows various high school kids through their last day of school. We cut between various preclass conversations in cars bedrooms offices etc. For every character there's a clearly and mechanically laid out conflict. Among them are a student who deals drugs a couple of students who's relationship is ending a tweaker student a group of bullies a teacher who is overly harsh on his students and the two misfit kids planning the shooting. There are lots and lots of flashbacks in black and white explaining how things got this way for the misfit kids.Clint Howard shows up as one of the shooter kids' emotionally abusive father. Jurgen Prochnow plays the school principal. And for no reason at all Michael Pare appears as the teacher in a performance that reminds us all why he's on the celebrity Z list. None of these characters seem all that convincing and the dialog comes straight from an after school special plus swearing of course. The writers don't realty seem to understand their teenage subjects resulting in the same major problem as Elephant you don't really come to care about the characters. Flimsy plot combined with irritating characters does not result in a compelling film.This subject deserved a much better treatment. However this is probably the height of schlock director Uwe Boll's career. The characters are irritating and some of them you wouldn't mind seeing killed but that's more than you can say for House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark. That said it is a tedious insultingly dumb movie which I doubt anyone could benefit from watching.".

Yes my French teacher can be really mean sometimes and yes i'm sure there were people on our school who used to get bullied but people like the bullies at the school in the movie really need help there is something wrong with them! I think it's great that it's shown that those mean people also have feelings you see the worst bully back off when his brother tells him about the girl they raped. I also think it's great that the movie confronts the people with the fact at the ending all the kids who killed people at school really freaked me out.The only thing i didn't like was that it was such a short movie! Only 87 minutes. But i still give this movie a 9.8 out of 10 at least! Brilliant completely underrated movie i think anyone who is interested in these kind of stories should see this movie.".

	schema:headline " Hey teachers leave those kids alone!";
	schema:reviewBody "Jurgen Prochnow and Michael Pare star as a principal and teacher of an average high school that has a columbine style shooting that will take the lives of many students of course along the way we will run into characters who deserve to die and those who don't the main point of interest is Prochnow and Pare who don't really strike one as the faculty type. I myself teach and well for one this movie fails to convince me as anything resembling reality. Whether it be with teachers or students. Michael Pare's character plays a teacher who openly mocks his student's work. If such a thing ever happened you would be suspended or even dismissed because we encourage not laugh at a student's work. Okay I don't teach English Pretty sure you can tell whoever has glanced at my reviews however it is pretty basic that all a teacher can take points off for is grammar errors rather than content of such material. At least at high school level. Anyway the movie itself fails to convince one of the students and their plights because it is far too overwrought in the humiliation sequences. These humiliation sequences that these kids put the shooters through is something more at home in Last House On The Left rather than a school yard. Kids do not force other kids to take their clothes off and eat feces rather they beat up on them. A far better film wouldn't have had any motivation of the killer's part and therefore it would feel more subtle and honest. There are some strong sequences such as the final showdown between the shooter and his tormentor but it is treated as just desserts and I for one can't bring myself to say that this has something rational to say if it is treated like an action movie. However despite a few bizarre moments of camera angles such as the part which is supposed to simulate a drug haze Heart Of America is Boll's most competent effort I've seen and although the results are fairly watchable It is quite obvious that Boll is oblivious in telling a story. He lacks subtleness and that is a big flaw in all his films. Also Prochnow and Pare as principal and teacher? Did Uwe Boll see Eddie And The Cruisers and Das Boot?   out of 4Fair".

	schema:reviewBody "Why do I watch these movies? people ask especially if you already know the director has a tendency to produce crap! Simple Answer there's more to learn from something done badly than something done brilliantly.The lesson once again is lack of restraint. If you as an artist find yourself wondering where that invisible line is where things go from good to too much then I must urge you to pick up one of Boll's films where he boldly crosses that line so you don't have to. And before too long indeed we're being introduced to too many characters set in a high school so I bet you can guess the dozen stereotypes before seeing the film. Don't need an introduction much less any development for these stereotypes right? Too bad. Not only do you get introduction but everyone's role gets spelled out so thoroughly that everyone gets that metaphorical name tag. I'm sorry  I shouldn't use the word metaphorical in a Boll review. It'll give the false impression of sophistication and subtlety both of which the director lacks.And since these characters lack subtext Boll attempts to create interest by cutting away from a scene prematurely not unlike those hackstorytellers whose narrative goes something like this the girl reached the dark and creepy door at the end of the spooky corridor she reaches for the handle and THEN  meanwhile Billy up the street  And not only do we get a full entourage of characters who need no introduction we also get full blown backstory on a number of them complete with black  white flashbacks haphazardly intercut with the present narrative. Take for example what should be a powerful flashback when the typical class losers are subject to humiliation and harassment from the bullies. This is intercut with the painfully long and monotonous series of shots of our losershooters  walking  and walking  and walking. You could almost  almost  stick it in a comedy and it could be a joke about how long it takes the character to get from point A to point B you know cut to a wide shot and show that it took him an hour to go five feet. That said it's amazing both how much and how little power remains in the film. The power that is there is no doubt attributed to the relevance of school shootings in American society. It's simply inherent to the subject matter just as a movie about Pearl Harbor would have been in 1942 or a movie about 911 released in 2002. Not even Boll's passion for ODing good concepts on steroids until they become hideous freaks of nature like Barry Bonds can't completely drain the power. That said given the subject matter and the time spent building up to the actual shooting it's amazing how little impact the film's climax has.Perhaps one reason lay in the contrived surprise that the film spoils almost from the opening scene. A kid wakes up to a phone call. It's the last day of school. Don't punk out on me. And he immediately powers on his computer so the same things can be exchanged in an IM. Why? Because it's easier to hide the identity of the last shooter if communication is only shown via computer screens. As the lead shooter is getting the guns he looks up to his offscreen accomplice and smiles I knew you wouldn't punk out on me. And I'm left wondering Gee Boll is going through great pains to not show someone's face  I wonder which of these spelledout characters it could be? Just like many films of this nature the ending features a superimposed paragraph which gets read to us by an unseen narrator about a real school shooting  then another brief paragraph about another real school shooting  then another  and another  and another. Once again a nice ending spoiled by the fact that Boll doesn't know when to quit and his knack for taking good ideas to a ridiculous selfparody caliber extreme. And that dear readers the upcoming film Postal just might work.".

It creates a mundane melodramatic explanation it annoys you with slowpaced trite uninteresting drama and it takes no risks.

This is a well observed well written and carefully crafted film. There are delightful performances from some of the cream of British light comedy actors. Dervla Kirwan with her smouldering good looks initially had me worried playing an averagely inhibited wife but she carried it off and her performance gained from the difference between her appearance and behaviour. British comedies can either be too smugly Home Counties based or too self consciously up north but despite being based around Tyneside this film neatly avoids being obsessed by its location . This may not be high art this may not convey any serious messages but the important task of entertaining and making people laugh which this film does admirably should not be underestimated.".

However as a fulllength feature this movie is awful. The men are onedimensional stereotypes straight from central casting whilst the women fare little better. The reallife Tyneside women I know are without exception stronger wittier and a damn sight sexier than any of the cutouts portrayed here. The cast do their best to inject some life into the lines they're given but as each character plods her way through an entirely predictable plot line it is difficult to sustain interest. Add a plot twist which is in the true sense of the word incredible and the production sinks without trace. For sisterhood solidarity movies give me 'Real Women Have Curves' or 'Beauty Shop' for Northern British comedy give me 'Brassed off' or 'Blow Dry'. 'School for Seduction'  it just sucks.".

They have beautiful images in their minds and an amazing talent to materialize them but not the ability or perhaps the desire to transform them into a watchable 2hour movie.The brothers were also present at the screening of the film. They admitted they were quite disappointed with the end result of the Piano Tuner... mostly because they had been forced to direct it with limited funds and in a shorter time than what they would have wanted. Because of the above problems they had to film it in Liepzig instead of Portugal and they had to wrap it up about a week earlier than it had originally been agreed. Also they weren't afraid to admit that they have never been able to finance a fulllength animation movie so they thought that a regular film would be a good excuse to squeeze some of their own animations in. Indeed there is a puppet showing up regularly in the film that does not really have anything to do with the happenings.All in all both these films make excellent memories when you recollect them some time after the screening. You have however to put up with the actual screening. If these phenomenally talented guys could find themselves a sharp screenwriter and most importantly some better financing they could easily create some timeless masterpieces.".

This is a film that should be seen if only because it is one of the most beautifully shot films of the last several years. Praised to the high heaven Pan's Labyrinth simply pales and disappears in comparison. The Brothers Quay are the visual masters with astounding talents for capturing dreams and transferring them to the screen in the most hypnotizing ways imaginable. We may not be able to always understand the meaning of a dream by trying to interpret its objects but it would not stop us from feeling the beauty and magic of the film. There is a story of course a fairytale about an evil doctor who abducts a beautiful opera singer with a magnificent voice whom he wants to transform into a mechanical singing device and a piano tuner of earthquakes who falls in love with her and tries to save her but every image and every sound of the movie are the story themselves. Everyone who feels at home in the worlds of David Lynch or Peter Greenaway Luis Bunuel or Jan Svankmajer Guy Maddin or the Brothers Polish who is impressed by Georges Franju's Les Yeux sans visage Jean Cocteau's Belle et la bte 1946 by both Patrick Susskind's and Tom Tykwer's Perfume The Story of a Murderer 2006 and by dark romantic fairy tales of E.T.

By creating an anachronistic scientific wonder their films derive their greatest strength.The basic plot of THE PIANO TUNER OF EARTHQUAKES could have been lifted right out of a story by German fantasy writer and composer E.T.A. Hoffmann. It concerns a piano tuner who travels to a distant estate owned by an elusive doctor. This doctor owns a number of clocklike mechanisms automatons he calls them which will be used to create a grand opera. He requests the tuner to get the automatons in perfectpitch working order. There's a subplot involving a beautiful opera singer whose life may be threatened by performing in the doctor's upcoming production.PIANO TUNER OF EARTHQUAKES was shot in color on High Definition video. Most of the daytime shots are enveloped in a haze. The color seems muted. Many composite shots with painted backgrounds are used. There's an ethereal feeling to the images.The worst parts of the film are where the narrative is forcefully injected. Some story bit is clarified and that tactic makes it seem like a cheap thoughtless movie. Only when sound effects music and visuals are used with no dialog the emotional effect is stunning.This is NOT an easy movie to watch. Watching this is about as fun as listening to a piece of music by Schoenberg or Webern. However fun or entertainment isn't the point. This film questions convention.Stopmotion animation shots for which the Brothers Quay are best known are used sparingly.The music often seems inappropriate very 1940's Hollywood sounding  and quite frankly I found it distracting it made everything seem more artificial than perhaps intended.Overall THE PIANO TUNER OF EARTHQUAKES gives one the impression of a movingphotograph gallery. And photographs are usually viewed best when you are not told what to think of them but instead are allowed to let your mind wander free from conventional thought and dream a picture's story for yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "Its a matter of abstraction. Always has been in everything I suppose. But especially in film. The business is one of sharpening some edges and making others recede so as to cut us in some way. Its a dangerous business for all concerned and if it ever seems too competent you know the blood is fake.The Quays like Madden and Greenaway go into forbidden visual zones. They do let me down sometimes when I sense fear but never when they stumble because stumbling is what shows the risk.These guys already have earned a place on my short list of films you really must see before you die. I only allow two in any year so it is something that their incredibly short Are We Still Married? is there. But there it is something that is so rich and open yet haunting it will change your dreams permanently.That short is entirely animated in their preferred style. They are Victorian in nature both in the junk they assemble to create their worlds but also in the cosmology they lean on. Its one where explicable means are all broken. Humanity escapes logic. Its the other side of the Holmes syndrome. Its where most of us live.That's that and this is this something more ambitious the long form. That means you must support the long arc a stretch across the cosmology longer than we can retain in our short memory. What they've done is rely on something we've seen before a mangod who captures life in a life within life fold. We are sometimes in and sometimes out. The in is one of seven automata complex mechanical devices that sing life.The tuner believes himself to be assisting in the maintenance of the machines from the outside but finds himself to be part of the mechanism. The existence of the machines allows the Quays to insert animated sequences that are supposed to merge with the live action. That live action is mostly dream space and when not is a pseudodream world of Victorian frames and hues.Its all just too lovely and risky and dangerous to be denied a place in your soul. Sure it comes dangerously close to the banal. Sure you can see a few seams and we all wish the budget for the final performance was bigger. But if you allow yourself to be swept in this as you routinely do for other science fiction worlds you will find a sort of psychic sexual release in some long sequences.In reading about this some cite Svankmejer as an influence. You need to understand this. Svankmeyer is a Czech animator a good one. He's an influence in just being there and surviving. But his world is organic and bleak. It is the stuff that comes from repeatedly beaten innocents. The Quays are more mechanical in their images more episodic in the small. And leagues more optimistic.

	onyx:emotionText "Its a matter of abstraction. Always has been in everything I suppose. But especially in film. The business is one of sharpening some edges and making others recede so as to cut us in some way. Its a dangerous business for all concerned and if it ever seems too competent you know the blood is fake.The Quays like Madden and Greenaway go into forbidden visual zones. They do let me down sometimes when I sense fear but never when they stumble because stumbling is what shows the risk.These guys already have earned a place on my short list of films you really must see before you die. I only allow two in any year so it is something that their incredibly short Are We Still Married? is there. But there it is something that is so rich and open yet haunting it will change your dreams permanently.That short is entirely animated in their preferred style. They are Victorian in nature both in the junk they assemble to create their worlds but also in the cosmology they lean on. Its one where explicable means are all broken. Humanity escapes logic. Its the other side of the Holmes syndrome. Its where most of us live.That's that and this is this something more ambitious the long form. That means you must support the long arc a stretch across the cosmology longer than we can retain in our short memory. What they've done is rely on something we've seen before a mangod who captures life in a life within life fold. We are sometimes in and sometimes out. The in is one of seven automata complex mechanical devices that sing life.The tuner believes himself to be assisting in the maintenance of the machines from the outside but finds himself to be part of the mechanism. The existence of the machines allows the Quays to insert animated sequences that are supposed to merge with the live action. That live action is mostly dream space and when not is a pseudodream world of Victorian frames and hues.Its all just too lovely and risky and dangerous to be denied a place in your soul. Sure it comes dangerously close to the banal. Sure you can see a few seams and we all wish the budget for the final performance was bigger. But if you allow yourself to be swept in this as you routinely do for other science fiction worlds you will find a sort of psychic sexual release in some long sequences.In reading about this some cite Svankmejer as an influence. You need to understand this. Svankmeyer is a Czech animator a good one. He's an influence in just being there and surviving. But his world is organic and bleak. It is the stuff that comes from repeatedly beaten innocents. The Quays are more mechanical in their images more episodic in the small. And leagues more optimistic. Their world is one where the sun shines but just over the edge of a place in which we are stuck.It makes all the difference. One you would bring children to in hopes that they would remain children in the edges and so make you wise. The Czech no.

The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes is riddled with problems the unnecessarily overbearing voiceover exposition during the first forty minutes the thin plot lines in the opening five minutes. The Quay Brothers seem to not be entirely sure what this film is about I don't get the sense that there was a mastermind behind this warped world like I do while watching Mulholland Drive. That said it is a very interesting film and if for no other reason this is a film that should be seen for being one of the most beautifully shot films of the last five years. The dried color palette the hazy dreamlike quality of the main character's POV and the stop motion animation all combine to create a film rich in texture and beauty. It seems that The Brothers Quay though maybe not the most talented of writers this I believe being only their second feature length as compared to stacks of rich short films they are certainly masters of the medium visually. It's an intense droning paced film. It's slow and garbled. But it's beautiful.".

As Filesberto the youthful and clean cut tuner he is summoned to the Doctor's mansion to repair his automatons. Here Malvina last seen falling dead on stage is miraculously alive although she appears as a ghost several times and she and Filesberto appear to be doomed to share a permanent time hiccup reminiscent of Resnais' 'Je T'aim Je T'aim'. The entire film has the atmosphere of being under water or in a permanent sunset and is so quiet that the postsynched dialogue often disappears entirely and only exists as the artfully added subtitles.

They do mix animation and liveaction well quite well in this movie but what The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes lacks more than any other film of theirs I've seen is the gutreaction most of their shorts give. It is infinitely visually pleasing but it doesn't have the power to awe or disturb the way their other work does.The reason? As best as I can tell the movement. There's something eerie and uncanny about the ways the brothers Quay craft actual motion but so much animation was cut out of this reportedly enough to make another featurelength and left to the liveaction that it just doesn't send off the same tone. They also make it worse by constantly fading out in the middle of shots. That approach is explained as an attempt to bring the viewer into a moment of high drama and then cut the light something evil Dr. Droz literally does in the movie but it tends to disappoint the viewer that just wants to revel in the strong visuals.I do really like the plotpoint about the ants and the spores and its reoccurrence later in the narrative. If the rest of the film had the power of that point it would have been truly unforgettable.I still consider the brothers Quay to be spectacular film artists and amazingly unique creative minds and I'll bet their further featurelength work will be even better.

However this was quality of unease was lost amongst the overblown imagery both visual and in the script that you were practically hammered over the head with.

It seemed that the plot was shoe horned in at irregular intervals giving a stuttering effect that detracted massively from the flow of the piece. The voice overs from Felisberto  especially the one at the end  very much felt like a desperate attempt to fill in gaping holes in the plot which had been ignored in favour of side issues such as the whole ant thing and even that wasn't properly addressed. I'm afraid the whole piece came across as at best a 'reasonable first attempt' by a teenager who has spent far too much time reading DH Lawrence.

	schema:reviewBody "I viewed the film Piano Tuner of the Earthquakes last night in Santa Monica California. It is an incredibly artistic piece but all that would be lost if it lacked a coherent story of some kind. The entire story however is clear once you know what to look for. First of all what we see is a dream by the narrator Piano Tuner who speaks in the first person describing the events. It is not one night's dream but a series of dreams chapters parts of which he dreams over and over sometimes having the details change slightly. The theme of the dream is simple the man who is dreaming has become in true life an obstetrician. In real life he tries to save mothers and infants in childbirth. He tries to make life sing through their souls and thus sees himself as a Piano Tuner. His recurring dreams arise from the fact that in his own childbirth his mother in the course of her convulsing labor the earthquakes died. He remembers this event as an earthquake and sees himself as the cause of her death. The young opera singer represents his dead mother. The older woman in the story represents the conscience or consciousness of his mother as she speaks to him from the grave. The man who hired the Piano Tuner probably represents inevitable death or the plain fact of history which will not change. The Piano tuner tries again and again to save his mother without success.To me having seen it once and never having heard anything about the film prior to viewing the movie that's the story. It was definitely worth the film experience to step into this complex world.Jack Forbes".

	schema:reviewBody "That the final result of the Piano Tuner of Earthquakes is not really a great movie is a given when taking into account that the style of which the Quay Brothers have gone to almost perfectionist lengths to attain is always leaping ahead in strength when compared to the dialog or the performances. The story itself is meant as a pinpoint line for the Quays to relay their staggering mix of mediums. After an opera singer Malvina dies during a performance though not really 'dead' but captured by Doctor Droz the notquitePhantom of the Opera of the story a mildmannered piano tuner who is sent out to Droz's estate but not to fix pianos. Rather he's sent to fix an automaton and soon discovers what is going to really happen the staging of a crazy otherwordily 'opera' with Malvina and decides he has to save her. The Quays' choices in actors Cesar Saracho as Felisberto Gottfried John as Doctor Droz Amira Casar as the helpless lady of the film Malvina and Assumpta Sera as Droz's caretakersometimes seducer of Felisberto are more based on their appearances and movements in scenes than really for ability in speech and emotion. Not that they don't have a moment or two when they get to connect with the poetic dialog John gets a good deal of this at times like when he is shown plotting away with his own agenda at hand. But it's really seeing them with their distinctive looks Saracho with his bony figure cast alongside the beautiful Casar in relation to what comes forward on screen. To say it's a feast for the eyes is an understatement and to try and describe much of what comes out in the Quay's design could make this too revealing and long a review. Yet it's the abandon of the usual logic and going headon into this world that earns their comparison to the likes of Cocteau we're given a look quite often at the automaton and its movements the gears and wheels churning in titled compositions and cut against the other seamlessly stopmotion movements. But more importantly this is set against the actors and then with other visuals such as inexplicable stopmotion creatures like a woodcutter or figures in the opera scenes and if one were to watch it with the sound turned off at home it wouldn't make much of a difference with the visceral impact of it all. Their design attempts to keep the audience in this world from the moment we see Dr. Droz's castle which is a computergenerated creation but a much more intricate and detailed kind of setpiece cut and chiseled in rock and steel. With many of these scenes set against the music of Duncan and Slaski which is as a given atmospheric and creepy and a very unsentimental and moving ending The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes knocks it out of the parts on technical terms and should not disappoint the diehard fans of the Quay brothers' previous works. It's also of no surprise now seeing it why it's the only film that Gilliam has ever had a producer credit on that has not been one of his own directorial efforts for the kind of mind that loves what can come about through in holding on to an idea and seeing it through in a fantastic manner it's a marvel. Just don't try and make sense of it all though. 7.510".

This is no talking heads documentary. It essentially covers the journey from the moment the allies land on Normandy till they take Berlin. All the while a series of voiceovers obviously scripted details the action as they talk. Be it English American Canadian Czech Russian female paramedics black soldiers we are given the whole shebang. The voices change as randomly as the scene changes. There is a problem though. The dialog is scripted and can sound corny and a bit rahrah and flagwaving. Everything is optimistic in this cinematic dairy so to speak. Scenes of allies being killed end with voiceover lines We lost 3000 but we moved on and the editors will jump away to scenes of the army defeating or bombing Berlin. They do not linger or failure or tragedy except when it matters at the concentration when we see the dead bodies and survivors. That said all sides of the human behavior are covered. We see soldiers who would rather shoot the Germans than capture them. You can feel the anger behind the voices of the soldiers as he chants racist mantras at the POWS. Anger happiness futility fear and foremost of all optimism is covered and the ending tells us that we can together and be one. The sea of flags ending might seem corny but it was made after the Great War. It has a right to be.".

	schema:reviewBody "The earlier review is accurate enough. This is a documentary of World War II in the west from the D Day landings to the surrender of the German Armed Forces. It's all news footage and maps without any talking heads. The narration is by dozens of people mostly from the UK and the US and is by turns folksy and formal. Some of the footage is brutal. On the whole the film reflects the feelings of most of the Allies at the time and the view of the Germans  all Germans  is pitiless. Some of the voices in the narration sounded familiar and I kept trying to identify them. They're not the voices of major movie stars like Cary Grant but rather supporting actors and players from movies and radio. Kids radio came before television see and there were these radio plays either funny or dramatic with names like The Whistler and Inner Sanctum and they used to employ lots of popular actors. As you may or may not know on radio you can only hear their voices. I thought I heard Jean Louis Heydt Deborah Kerr Sam Levine and Peter Lawford but might have been mistaken. From the script Through hedges and fields they carved their heavy way. Down we cast the gauntlet challenging the enemy to stand and fight! To the extent that the narration is folksy  or corny if you like  there's good reason for it. Among the writers were Harry Brown who specialized in Army banter and gave us the exceptional war film A Walk In The Sun. And the more florid dialog probably belongs to Paddy Chayevsky the man who gave us I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to TAKE IT anymore!The message of the movie is spelled out loud and clear. We won this by all pulling together. Let's keep on keeping on. One folksy GI voice says The ones who want to start World War III haven't seen this one  or not enough of it. That was probably aimed at Stalin but the lesson still applies today.Much of the footage will be familiar to today's viewers but it was fresh in 1945  the concentration camps the burning jeep The British soldier waiting to leap from his landing craft into the sea on D Day and being tapped on the shoulder by the guy behind him and being startled by it. But in the spirit of internationalism some battles are described however briefly that are unfamiliar to most Americans  the clearing of the Antwerp estuaries for instance an essential but dirty job with no glamor attached to it carried out chiefly by Canadians.It's also a bit surprising to see Operation Market Garden described in such detail. It was after all an unmitigated Allied defeat and from 1945 one expects only a flagwaving panorama of Allied victories. Full credit is given to all the Allied nations involved with the Czechs Poles and Free French being mentioned. All of the other Armed Forces are mentioned as well  the air forces and the navies. No reference to the US Coast Guard although some of its members show up on screen. One enlisted man in the USCG managed to win a posthumous Medal of Honor at Normandy.Nobody should expect a history lesson from this documentary. It's impressionistic and segues insensibly from one battle to the next. The maps are no help. In the print I saw they were all furry with details and had cartoon airplanes flags and soldiers drawn onto them as if done by Walt Disney while drunk. Any more confusing and they'd look like a work by Jackson Pollack. Yet the editors can't be blamed for that. They did a good job of stitching combat footage together. Not a frame is interpolated from the Pacific theater. And showing the war's end we see the flames of artillery firing the images and sounds slowly receding from foreground to background growing infrequent until the last of the little white spots disappears. It's an imaginative touch.".

Walking away from it one gets the feeling that this was a war that had to get fought and when you think about it it WAS the last war declared by congress  as opposed to the president unilaterally launching it  and we paid for it with high taxes. None other than Dwight Eisenhower introduces it and reminds the viewer that this is firsthand footage of the war. We get narration from all sorts of people multiple nationalities and even multiple races.But something else caught my eye. Towards the end we get footage of US troops meeting Soviet troops and both sides hit it off. Any scholar of WWII knows that the USSR was our ally in that war. Well a mere two years later the United States and Soviet Union became enemies. A person seeing this documentary just a few years after its release would've gotten left befuddled at the sight of Ivan and GI Joe happily shaking hands now that the US considered the USSR the world's 1 threat. But as George Orwell depicted in Nineteen EightyFour alliances shift depending on which war it is and memories of previous alliances get erased.Well one has to understand that the documentary got released right after the war ended. The footage of Roosevelt Churchill and Stalin holding their conference looked heroic most people didn't know that Truman had ditched FDR's plans for a future without war. It's understandable that the documentary won Best Documentary Feature at the Academy Awards in 1946. While the propaganda factor may seem overthetop I still recommend the documentary as a look at the mindset in late 1945. To think that there was that brief period when it looked as though there would never be another war and now a nuclear holocaust looks like a real possibility.Anyway you should see it but also watch The Atomic Cafe.It's probably worth noting that as president Ike taxed the rich at 90 to pay off the war debt and build the Interstate system defended Social Security and worked to ease tensions with the Soviet Union. He could never get elected as a conservative nowadays.".

The nighttime footage is remarkable too. Not all of the verbal recounts resonate with a lot of flagwaving dialogue however several lines linger long in the mind I'm not squeamish... but I'm human and the documentary refreshingly includes recounts from an extensive variety of personnel. Sure most of the interviewees are soldiers but we also get the perspective of an army hospital nurse a war reporter and the list goes on. The documentary also curiously mentions the prospect of World War III some time in then foreseeable future with a reminder that war really can be a horrible thing. Indeed while the film sometimes feels like the Allies patting themselves on the back for a successful victory 'The True Glory' does not shy away from depicting how grueling war is and it deserves some credit for that.".

Diego Luna Martha Tenorio Rafael Incln and Rosa Mara Bianchi are very good. At the time dark urban comedies may have been a trend in Mexican cinema but that does nOt stop 'Nicotina' from being fun.";

	schema:reviewBody "Nicotina 5 out of 10 Nicotina represents a black comedy tradition that has been alive and well in Mexico for over fifty years. Death is around every corner and it is a punch line to boot. All the men are womanizers and many of the women are no better. Director Hugo Rodrguez and Writer Martn Salinas took this beloved tradition and married it to its distant cousin the Quentin Tarantino crime film.It is a decent fit. The basic plot is that a Mexican criminal gang is switching computer bank codes with a Russian gangster for diamonds. I do not think I am spoiling anything by pointing out that not everything goes as planned. The two criminal gangs end up involving the computer geek that downloaded the data. His next door neighbor a sexy and promiscuous cellist played by Marta Belaustegui Her conductor a possible future sugar daddy a plant toting upstairs neighbor a pharmacist couple with a beautiful saintly wife played admirably by Carmen Madrid and a beauty shop couple with an evil harridan wife played chillingly by Rosa Mara Bianchi plus the occasional police officer and a scary dog.Some of the camera tricks can be fancy without any underling purpose and I have not seen this much pastel neon on buildings since that Don Johnson episode of True Hollywood Stories. Overall the film is nice. It is a pleasant good time. It is not particularly scary thrilling funny sexy or clever and that is its only real fault. There is nothing terrible memorable in the ninety odd minutes of movie. Oh and do not watch if you are trying to quit smoking. I have never seen a movie so relentless in its promotion of tobacco. It is like watching Eat Drink Man Woman while trying to diet".

Lots of soapoperas are done in Mexico too and there's a lot of television.And as I said many times television looks like movies which is good but also movies look like television which is absolutely terrible. Nicotina starts as silent as a telephonic call with one line in the screen that represents a person talking and another one that represents another person and so it goes. It also has the usual black screen with anything on it typical of directors that don't take risks.The story follows Lolo a hacker lost in the lust of her neighbor Andrea's love who has to enter an account to get money for el Nene who drives with Tomson and has to pay a Russian mobster that will sell some much cherished diamonds to him. This leads to shoots and encounters in different places like Goyo's and his wife Barbershop or Beto's and his wife Pharmacy.The actors are Marta Belaustegui Lucas Crespi Jess Ochoa Norman Sotolongo Rafael Incln Rosa Mara Bianchi Daniel Gimnez Cacho Carmen Madrid and Diego Luna and they all accomplish their portrayals very well. The latter one is the cover of the film or the most known of the actors nowadays. I won't tell his whole story but I will say that being the reason many people saw the movie he doesn't deliver.What ensue are multiple talks between all of the characters. Not any talks but insightful interesting metaphoric talks that ultimately seem to lead to the film's title. And the writer Martin Salinas is probably the most prepared man of the crew whose first words for a movie got Norma Aleandro an Oscar nomination. He has written for series for movies in two languages This script however presents a contradiction. We can't tell if his plot is an excuse to develop these conversations or even worse if the conversations are an excuse to fill the incoherent plot. And it's right there in the plot where the film has its defined problems. The ending is fantastic indeed and thought provoking but we get confused during the road and we don't feel the time.When Goyo's wife is about to shoot him the shot changes to another scenario. Strangely and incorrectly when the camera goes back to the couple's barbershop the woman is still holding the gunAfter five minutes. Is not only Salinas' fault but director Hugo Rodriguez's because he prefers not to take risks during his second feature.And he can't manage the timing. And it looks like television.

There are many hilarious scenes a love story triangle outstanding scenery of the English countryside and outstanding acting by the big 3 Men. I would have to rate this one of my Top Ten movies of all time.This movie had no gaps or letdowns and I couldcan not stop watching it. I've easily seen it a dozen times or more and just caught it again last week on Showtime.Let me cite some of the extraordinary scenes in this flick.

There are many hilarious scenes a love story triangle outstanding scenery of the English countryside and outstanding acting by the big 3 Men. I would have to rate this one of my Top Ten movies of all time.This movie had no gaps or letdowns and I couldcan not stop watching it. I've easily seen it a dozen times or more and just caught it again last week on Showtime.Let me cite some of the extraordinary scenes in this flick.  The Rap song by the Big 3 amazing! the Big 3's kitchen scene regarding the discussion of possible suitors for Sylvia the bachelor's swinging NYC party scene Selleck's blonde was a major fox! Fiona Shaw's pursuit of Tom Selleck in the Pileforth Academy and the ending's madcap frenzy!What a movie!";

Better storyline that kept you interested mainly the fact that half of the film is set in South England which gave the film a different angle and made it more interesting. Now on to the actors definitely Ted Danson was the best actor as Jack Holden closely followed by Tom Selleck as Peter Mitchell. I have seen this film since i was 3 years old when it first came out and it remains as a classic comedy alongside Uncle Buck Planes Trains and Automobiles etc its classed alongside those kind of films i think and overall it gets a 710".

This is not the best movie I have ever seen but it never tried to be neither did it attempt to be better than the first. It was just an enjoyable movie with one or two minor problems along the way. The scenery and cinematography was actually pretty lovely and I liked the soundtrack too. The script was decent the pacing was snappy the story while predictable was entertaining and there were some funny sight gags and situations. The direction was neat and the acting was fine. Robin Weisman is quite appealing as Mary and Tom Selleck Steve Guttenberg and Ted Danson were great together and individually. Also seeing Shiela Hancock is always a plus. Overall cute and entertaining. 810 Bethany Cox".

While given that this movie certainly deserves a higher rating than 4.5 probably about a 6 it is certainly nowhere near being the best film ever. Danson Selleck and Guttenberg are great together and the supporting cast is good too. There is one classic moment because it is so accurate of a farmer giving the three men directions on how to get to a church as he describes in painstaking detail the road that they should avoid taking. As with most comedies some of the jokes just don't work at all. This doesn't make it a poor comedy this just stops it from being a above average one.This film is a solid piece of feel good cinema with great casting though not neccessarily a great cast and I can only assume people rate films on a different scale to me.".

This story sees Sylvia's work making her move back to England while Pete and Mike follow Jack is filming. The boys especially Pete who eventually realises he loves Sylvia are trying to make sure not only Mary has a good school not boarding and towards the end stop Sylvia's wedding to some bozo. Also starring Christopher Cazenove as Edward Hargreave Sheila Hancock as Vera Bennington Harry Potter's Fiona Shaw as Miss Elspeth Lomax John Boswall as Barrow Edward's Butler and Jonathan Lynn as Vicar Hewitt. To be honest only the opening montage and music and the only funny moment of the film when Jack is disguised with great makeup as a vicar these are the only worthwhile parts. If you liked the first film I would insist you don't bother with this nonsense a terrible comedy sequel. Pretty poor!".

And I'm very glad to have done so! First of all the cast is great! Axel Stein does a really great job and also Semmelrogge is very funny in his short scene. I didn't know any of the youngsters but all of them played their part very well  you instantly buy their roles the way they play them! And then there is the modernization of the context. Enormeausly welldone! Many nice gags where I laughed out loud! This is a movie for everyone the youngsters young adults like me I'm in the middle of my twenties and the elder generation! I hope you have read the novel but if you haven't I'm sure you are eager to do after you watched this fantastic movie.Heck! I even caught myself gladly smiling at the very end!".

	schema:reviewBody "Vorstadtkrokodile or Suburban Crocodiles is Christian Ditter's approach to the Max von der Grn children's book and 1977 movie. For some reason I do not understand Ditter won Best Kids Movie of the Year at the German Film Awards 5 years ago. Must have been very weak competition. Most recently made his foreign language film debut by working with Lily Collins and he has another project with her and Dakota Johnson coming up. He also directed the second Vorstadtkrokodile movie  but not the third and final one. Before that he worked on the Michael Herbig's Wickie sequel and the television series Trkisch fr Anfnger.Lead actor Nick Romeo Reimann has been in the Wilde Kerle franchise previously but most of the other child actors are fairly or completely new to movie acting. Still they are better than Reimann in whom I just can't see any range especially in terms of drama which sucks as all the smaller characters are there to deliver comedy and he essentially fails with delivering the edgeofseat stuff. If you get a hand on the old original movie take a look at it. There are some differences. For example the wheelchair kid was played by a girl. I won't go into further detail but it's a bit of a classic unlike this one. The core topics are similar though. It's about accepting disabled people about brotherly loyalty and about finding out who your true friends are. It also starts with some roof action. The cast includes Nora Tschirner rapper Smudo Maria Schrader Axel Stein Ralf Richter and Jacob Matschenz. Many familiar faces here. And last but not least Martin Semmelrogge is also in it in a very small role. He played a main character in this movie back in the 1970s.They included a girl in one of the main roles also a kid for foreign roots Albanian I believe. He reminded me a bit of Manny from Modern Family. I kinda liked him as his unfunniness was intended. Most of the other humor in this film was not funny at all but it was actually intended to be funny. Many great kids films from Germany currently out there. This is not one of them. Quite a shame the story offers great potential but the script simply isn't good enough. Stay away.".

	schema:reviewBody "Righteous Kill is one of those films that a lot of people have just been looking forward too because it has two of the greatest actors of our generation Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino. I must add how I love in a lot of the TV ad's they're saying this is their first film together true it's the first time they are real costars together but they've had two films already. Anyways back onto the film Robert and Al are both incredible actors we know that Robert is actually my favorite actor so naturally I was looking forward to seeing this movie I hate to say this oh man I hate to say this but this film was an utter disappointment. I'm not saying this was a bad movie but this was a sad and very predictable thriller that could have been done with more average actors Al and Robert are above this script and don't pull in their best performances due to that. The story is very mediocre compared to some of these terrific actors who looked so bored throughout the move.Turk and Rooster are partners on the police force having experienced over 30 years of constant bad guys going free seeing the innocent's blood shed and all the injustice in the world they've almost lost it. Suddenly there are murders involving the criminals they have arrested along with younger officers they try to figure out what is going on but when one of the cops brings up that it might be a vigilante situation Turk and Rooster are hesitant. Maybe they're hiding some secrets of their own.Righteous Kill don't get me wrong it's worth the look especially to see these cinematic legends on screen together but like I said for the script they were given this was way too average and they are above it. I even hate to say it this was very predictable if you've seen a lot of these thriller movies of today. Not to mention I think Al Pacino this must have been his third movie where he has worn that same leather jacket I mean is it just me or does anyone else notice this? Over all it's not a bad movie but it could have just been done with average actors instead of all the hype that has been around it because of the actors. Just don't be fooled it's a typical thriller nothing special I suggest waiting for the rental.610".

Victims are lawbreakers who were freed on legal technicalities. Two other cops played by John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg become suspicious of the investigation and this hampers the efforts of Turk and Rooster.The script on which the film is based is rather poor. The setup is muddled none of the characters are especially sympathetic and secondary characters are not well defined. Further Righteous Kill is not that much different from other serial killer or urban crime films.The mood here is dark and the tone is rather cynical. Characters go out of their way to telegraph their toughness by using lots of hard language. There's an edginess to the characters and that's okay. But I could have wished for a character with some degree of softness. That would have provided much needed balance to the overall tonal savagery.Without a doubt the film's best element is the acting. There's not a weak performance in the bunch. Of course the focus is on De Niro and Pacino. This is really their film. And it's their camaraderie their back and forth playful banter that makes the film worth watching. Production design and costumes are credible. Color cinematography is generally dark consistent with the story's mood.In spite of a weak script Righteous Kill does provide some good plot misdirection that will leave viewers unsure as to the story's outcome. But the film's main virtue is the casting of De Niro and Pacino two contemporary screen legends whose performances here are quite good.".

Fellow actors aren't too strong either and much of the action seems to be just going with the flow. The storyline is interesting enough with a good finale but never seems to grip you through much of the film.Overall its a disappointment and you expect better from a film that has de Niro  Pacino together in it.".

It doesn't fit it doesn't look cool it looks ridiculous and disappointing! I mean c'mon learn from actors like Anthony Hopkins he is 70 and still does films that kick ass like Fracture. He doesn't go running fighting or anything like that in the contrary he does films that FIT HIS AGE! Anyways this is just my opinion...".

	schema:reviewBody "FINALLY! DeNiro! Pacino! Together! For more than one scene! I couldn't wait. I'm also happy to say that while the film won't be winning any Oscars it isn't bad by any means and is certainly an improvement over Pacino and director Jon Avnet's last film 88 Minutes. Avnet is growing as a filmmaker and has learned from past mistakes. Righteous Kill is an acceptable mystery film and of course features two great performances from two of the greatest of all time.Righteous Kill despite having the two leads that it does is really a director's film and Jon Avnet cloaks the film in a black blanket of mystery very well. While the main plot twist of the film and oh there are many of them is sort of obvious the fact that there's more to it than that really helps the film and saves it from oblivion.What I liked most about the film however was the casting of DeNiro in a role Pacino would normally play the hotheaded cop who just can't seem to keep his mouth shut or stop cursing and Pacino in a role DeNiro would normally play the reserved yet silently intense friend. The film is split up into two parts each showcasing the talents of one of the legends. Unfortunately I can't really describe the performances in a deep way without coming close to spoilers but rest assured both are excellent. John Leguizamo is a nice addition as a hot headed detective at odds with DeNiro and Carla Gugino as the eye candy was not a mistake by any means. I have no comment on the inclusion of 50 Cent in this film. Thankfully he doesn't have a ton of screen time.The script of the film on paper isn't really good but there's a few techniques that really work on screen such as the main characters' nicknames and the feeling that almost everyone in the film is bad. I definitely like Avnet a little more now. DeNiro and Pacino share a wealth of screen time and have a lot of meat to chew on as actors especially DeNiro who turns up the intensity and the New York accent it's a little stronger here than it normally is. While the film won't go down as legendary I think every fan of both actors will be pleased and will smile at numerous moments just because these two are playing off each other so often and so well.My complaints lie with the emotional feel of the film which I felt wasn't strong enough. I wanted to shed tears in the end but for some reason I couldn't. I won't say the acting in the climax could have been stronger but had it been done in a different way I might have liked it a bit more. All in all Righteous Kill is not a bad film as it managed to keep my attention and hold me in suspense for it's duration without making me feel frustrated. It definitely requires your full attention and may even require a couple of viewings.".

Director Jon Avnet 88 Minutes Fried Green Tomatoes and writer Russell Gewirtz Inside Man have discovered that.On a bright note Avnet somehow managed to avoid the whiny screaming Pacino that we have been subjected to so many times these past few years. Instead we get a guy drifting through the film as if drugged like a hyperactive child. DeNiro on the other hand does all he can do to be the tough aging cop. We are treated to the facials hand gestures and top notch line deliveries that we have come to expect.The two legends are joined by rival partners John Leguizano and Donnie Wahlberg who are convinced that Deniro's Turk is a serial killer. Their captain in this is the rarely seen Brian Dennehy. DeNiro's character somehow is hooked up with the department ME played scorchingly by Carla Gugino who in real life would undoubtedly be cheating on her multimillionaire husband and not working for a living. Almost as a story line tossin rapper 50 Cent plays a drug dealing club owner who tries to play ball with the cops. Also want to mention that Alan Rosenberg has a small role and offers a reminder of his skills which have been rarely seen since he became President of SAG.The film has many twists and turns and diversions but there really is no doubt who the serial killer is. The video of DeNiro apparently confessing to the crime was actually a good idea and some of his best work. As with 88 Minutes I am just not pleased with Avnet's directorial style. The attempts to shoot cool shots and toss in some quick focus just give it the look of someone trying too hard to be Scorcese. Still it is worth seeing for DeNiro but you probably won't be surprised.While certainly watchable this one is just not quite as smart as it tries to be.".

John Leguizamo Donnie Wahlberg and Carla Gugino are amongst the strong costars. John Leguizamo is a brilliant actor. i loved him in Summer Of Sam and Spun. Donnie Wahlberg has also surprised me in his roles in the saw films. the story is basically set around two cops Turk and Rooster on the verge of retirement and they have a big homicide case ahead of them. once they start investigating you see that this case has a big story behind it. such as cop corruptionthis film is really well made and had me glued. the twist's in this film are remarkable and has a lot of originality to it.... brilliant...... 1010......j.d Seaton".

People have been waiting since Heat in '95 for another film where Pacino and De Niro costar and this is what us loyal fans are given? Unacceptable you have two of the greatest actors playing side by side and you give them this predictable and twisted script? WHHYYY!!?? If they were going to make another De NiroPacino flick they should've made it fantastic. This is mediocre. First off why in name of all that is holy would they include 50 cent in a De NiroPacino movie. Who does that? It's as if they are purposefully lowering the value of this movie. Rule number 1 when making movies with classic actors  don't use ghetto gold tooth untalented rappers as filler actors use good ones. Heat was full of good actors who played their parts well and spoke clearly unlike the infamous fitty.The story is very bad. It's too twisted and nonsensical. It's similar to Street Kings which is a very bad thing. Pacino and De Niro act well but not what you'd expect from these kind of actors. It's not entirely their fault it's not easy making a rusty script shine even if you've been acting for 30 years.The music is pretty good. It sets the proper moods for most of the situations so it adds a little realism to the movie. The action is pretty weak. Heat was full of intense unpredictable and suspenseful action. This movie has predictable poorly filmed action.Now here comes the spoiler to those who saw Heat. The ending is exactly the same as in Heat only the other actor gets killed this time. Honestly could they get any more desperate that they have to copy the ending of a classic to make the ending of a bad movie slightly better. What's even sadder is that it didn't make anything better especially if you're a Heat fan.Conclusion If they wanted to make another De NiroPacino movie the writers and director should have tried much harder to make another classic as good if not better than Heat or they should never have tried in the first place. It's insulting. You should watch it just to judge for yourself but don't get your hopes up.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is appalling. De Niro is 65 Pacino is 68 Dennehey is 70. Serious actors who have all done some brilliant work in their time labouring under the delusion that they can act 'young'. And of course they can't. It is embarrassing. Clint used to be the master? of this genre Harrison Ford has had a shot at it  but to see actors of the calibre of De Niro and Pacino having a go is dreadful surely they did not need the money... De Niro's love interest is in her 30s and looks it  despite having had enough botox to sink a ship. In the real world De Niro can pull a mid 30s woman because of his money and power but as a humble detective? I think not. There are mild sex scenes  spoiler alert?  and they make you wince.

This movie is all about 'lazy' and trading on reputations. I think Pacino is a genius  I watched Carlito last night De Niro is brilliant  I think 'Ronin' and I ambushed you with a coffee cup Dennehey has done wonderful work  the first Rambo movie for example. In this film they are assuming that nobody will notice that they are all 20 years too old. They are wrong and I find this a bit disrespectful.And all the above is before beginning to consider the plot. Which is lazy and formulaic  if you make it to the final 'twist' you will be neither surprised nor care. This film is aimed simply at the 'fan' market  those who will get excited at Pacino and De Niro in the same film together a la 'Heat'. But 'Heat' was a brilliant film and this is but a piece of lazy self indulgent nonsense.I am not a 'fan' of any artist per se I am a 'fan' of their serious work. If they chose to disrespect me  in the way that the three male leads here have done  I feel that I have very little choice but to disrespect them for my part.Pacino has had a dabble with Shakespeare  his Shylock was excellent I have not seen his Richard  I would love to see him do Lear. I do not need to see him put on his leather jacket again. Not at 68.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film is appalling. De Niro is 65 Pacino is 68 Dennehey is 70. Serious actors who have all done some brilliant work in their time labouring under the delusion that they can act 'young'. And of course they can't. It is embarrassing. Clint used to be the master? of this genre Harrison Ford has had a shot at it  but to see actors of the calibre of De Niro and Pacino having a go is dreadful surely they did not need the money... De Niro's love interest is in her 30s and looks it  despite having had enough botox to sink a ship. In the real world De Niro can pull a mid 30s woman because of his money and power but as a humble detective? I think not. There are mild sex scenes  spoiler alert?  and they make you wince.

The script in a way is much better than I might have thought and the actors stars Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in a film technically for the third time and for the first time technically in the frame for more than a few seconds a pressure obviously from those who whined about their bit at the diner in Heat as well as the likes of Brian Denehey and Carla Gugino do their best to make it an entertaining ride. And for all of its recycled elements and plot turns and toughguy takenos dialog it's a fun ride for what it's worth as far as substance goes. You want to see what will happen with these two veteran cop characters as they delve deeper into this killer case somewhat ripped off from Magnum Force or something like that in terms of the victims and what the twist will ultimately be.For those who might think it tired or stiff I wouldn't put any real blame on the stars or even Gerwitz's flawed screenplay which does occasionally pull off dark and funny banter and some coarse dialog and action and thrills to the degree that one saw in his Inside Man script. The problem mostly was the direction Jon Avnet is not a visionary nor is he a really wellsuited neonoir director. He's just a competent technician if not veerying close to outright hack enough to dig up a few potent bits or visual touches and mostly tries to make the film hip and fresh and inventive with the approach to style in the flashbacks and he doesn't possibly bypass the pitgalls in Gerwitz's script. What is pleasing ultimately about the picture is that it's not bad at all and is actually a good movie. But with characters played by near generational icons dubbed in the film as like Lennon and McCartney this isn't quite up to their previous snuff together. They deserve just a little better with the likes of Godfather 2 and Heat to their previous collaborations.".

It contains every cop movie clich in the book lots of 'manly' dialogue and ends with our two cop buddies spouting deathbed philosophy. On a broad scale movies come in three sorts 1. Stories that just have to written because they need to be told. Often these are based on real events. Then someone thinks about how to put it on screen and who might be good actors to cast in the various roles.2. The truly vivid memorable imaginings of someone really creative who wants to construct an entertaining fantasy. Then as in number 1 someone thinks about who might be good actors to cast in the various roles.3. Highly contrived and often unlikely vehicles for Big Names who want to make another movie and may have convinced a studio exec that they can fill a few seats in movie houses. And get paid a lot.In other words in 1 and 2 the story comes first and in 3 the actor comes first. I'm a big fan of the first two and very dubious about the third. And I'm afraid Righteous Kill comes squarely in category 3. I didn't actually hate it but it overwhelmed me with indifference. And I used to love these guys!De Niro Turk and Pacino Rooster  and even the names put me off  are two veteran very veteran but more of that later New York cops. They are working a case which appears to involve a serial killer who has set himself up as judge and jury to take out the nasty people the courts let off. They may or may not have put the wrong person away for a murder some years before. The sticky serial killer finger of guilt is pointing inexorably to it being one of their own a cop. It's really just a case of staying awake long enough to establish which one of our tough guy antiheroes it is. Now it seemed so blindingly obvious to me within the first half an hour who the guilty party was that I thought it must be a double bluff. You know it's so obviously X that it must really be Y but hey that's too simple too so really it's X after all but we're supposed to think it's Y etc. But no. It really was that simple. It was X all the time and any double bluff was merely my overactive imagination striving to keep me interested. Although I will say in the movie's defense that my spouse didn't 'get it' until the very end. Unfortunately that may say more about him than it does about the movie! He'd had a tough week at work.I hate to have to say this but De Niro and Pacino are just too old to convincingly play tough guys any more. Pacino bears a passing resemblance to Keith Richards these days and although De Niro may have weathered slightly better I kept thinking as I watched this that no studio would ever cast two grizzled women in their sixties as street wise cops so why am I  a grizzled woman in my 50s supposed to find these two guys convincing? The female characters are the usual run of plain but virtuous weeping rape victims and semiclothed quasi hookers beloved of tough guy cop movies except for the token CSI copette Karen Corelli Carla Gugino who is of course a stunner. She appears both clothed and semi clothed.We see very little of her professional aptitude but our Karen loves nothing more than a bit of rough sex with Turk and as there are only some 28 years between Gugino and De Niro I should probably be grateful she wasn't bonking Rooster. In one particularly gratuitous scene Karen gets sexually aroused by Turks' vivid description of the violence inflicted on a suspect which is doubtless intended to get that vital 1830 male demographic giggling but should really have the whole NYC female police corps out on strike in protest. At the vital moment she loses her bottle and can't shoot the bad guy. Sigh I just find such sexist tripe so tedious these days. I can't imagine where my sense of humour went? I mean it was funny the first two or three hundred times I saw it. In movie after movie. But now? No thanks. Definitely 2 thumbs down for this clichd hackneyed tedious B flick. De Niro and Pacino do you really need the money THAT much?".

It contains every cop movie clich in the book lots of 'manly' dialogue and ends with our two cop buddies spouting deathbed philosophy. On a broad scale movies come in three sorts 1. Stories that just have to written because they need to be told. Often these are based on real events.

	schema:reviewBody "Righteous Kill was one of the biggest cinematic letdowns of 2008. Costarring for the third and probably final time in their movie careers Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro starred in this hackneyed confusing thirdrate thriller that is utterly unworthy of their talents. The fact that DeNiro and Pacino have been coasting for years now is well known DeNiro's better performances over the last decade have been in broad comedies like Meet the Parents whilst his big directorial project The Good Shepherd was a washout. Pacino meanwhile has seen his once mighty reputation evaporate through his involvement in junk like 88 Minutes and Gigli. That the two whose previous collaborations were the masterpiece crime dramas The Godfather Part II 1974 and Heat 1995 should have reteamed in an effort to score another critical and box office hit is understandable. What is not understandable is why they should have picked such a weak contrived script why they should saddle themselves with such unattractive confusingly motivated characters and why they should chose a director Jon Avnet who simply cannot hope to compete with Francis Ford Coppola and Michael Mann. Of course it does not help that the film is blighted by a peculiar piece of reverse casting As a pair of detectives tracking a vigilante serial killer DeNiro takes the kind of part Pacino used to be able to play in his sleep a hotheaded selfrighteous bully loaded with sexual energy whilst Pacino plays a part more obviously suited to DeNiro quieter and more introspective but hiding a dark side. The actors look uneasy treading on each other's toes DeNiro showed far more natural chemistry with Dustin Hoffman in Wag the Dog and Meet the Fockers and Pacino in particular is certainly starting to look his age without their usual command of the screen the film simply plods along towards a very obvious twist finale. The always sexy Carla Gugino Spin City Sin City here has a distasteful role as DeNiro's kinky colleague and Brian Dennehy is wasted but Donnie Wahlberg and John Leguizamo who were impressive in the TV miniseries The Kill Point in parts clearly modelled on the characters played by DeNiro and Pacino in Heat are quite good as a rival pair of cops. Righteous Kill is a very bad film. It is not the worst film I've ever seen but it is certainly one of the most disappointing and in some ways that is even worse. Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro separately and together gave us some of the greatest American films of the last few decades that they should be reduced to flaccid pap like this in their twilight years is pretty pathetic.".

Complications arise when they are joined in the chase by two other veteran cops played seriously enough by John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg. Although they are all seeking the killer they also quarrel with each other as to who their main suspect is. Adding to the quad four is Brian Dennehy playing Lieutenant Hingis. The film is gritty action oriented and dizzyingly confusing. Still it grabs you as you play criminal roulette. With Carla Gugino as Karen Corelli who spices up the story and '50 Cent Curtis Jackson as a very cool character called 'Spider' the movie is hot with intrigue and suspense. The overall tenor of the movie is good but I reserve the word terrific as I expected more BANG for my buck and my two favorites did not quite deliver as I remained unconvinced expecting a bit more from their dynamite appearances.

	schema:reviewBody "Even when matched up against his Oscarwinning 1992 film UNFORGIVEN THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES must rank as being among Clint Eastwood's finest turns both in front of and behind the camera. Having displayed a solid feel for the director's chair with 1971's PLAY MISTY FOR ME and 1973's HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER Eastwood took the reins on JOSEY WALES when he and the original director Philip Kaufman who still shared a cowrite of the script and had directed 1972's THE GREAT NORTHFIELD MINNESOTA RAID ran into some pretty strong disagreements. The end result was one of the best westerns of the 1970s in critical commercial and artistic terms.Eastwood's character is a farmer living out a quiet life in Missouri near the end of the Civil War who is forced to see his whole family and homestead wiped out by marauding Redlegs from Kansas. He joins up with a guerrilla band of Southerners to set things aright. But when the Union betrays those same guerrillas into surrendering and then promptly slaughters all of them Eastwood takes violent revenge. He soon finds himself of the run at the reluctant hands of his former commander John Vernon and a determined Union man named Terrill Bill McKinney who played one of the sadistic mountain men in DELIVERANCE. As he heads towards Texas he encounters a motley group of outcasts Chief Dan George Sondra Locke Paula Trueman and becomes less obsessed by violent revenge and more interested in helping going for his guns only when McKinney's Union troop closes in and bounty hunters come looking for him.In contrast to the Man With No Name persona he codified with Sergio Leone in the 1960s or the tough cop he personified in DIRTY HARRY Eastwood's Josey Wales is a man of great courage and sympathy who becomes tired of all the violence he has had to see and to take part in. The vengeance motif is largely played out by the time the film is into its second half and it only comes back towards the tail end for a brief moment. Those who have tagged Eastwood as a political reactionary a John Wayne of our time have certainly misjudged him as even one viewing of THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES will testify to. He is not interested in being tough for the sake of being tough he just wants to survive and he wants those he protects to be able to live in peace. That's why although the film is unavoidably violent at times it has a considerable humanity too and why it remains one of Eastwood's finest films even to this day.".

	schema:headline " A personal tour de force for Eastwood!";
	schema:reviewBody "Eastwood's film had all the necessary elements to make a classic... There are in his movie a lot of thoughts about war and the victims of war... The film has the magical combination of historical fact and cowboy fantasy...The fantasy as ever is Eastwood... Josey Wales switches from a simple peasant farmer to stonecold killer... His shooting becomes as precise as his tobacco spitting... Whether he is merely taking a split second to reverse the two guns he is pretending to hand over to some bounty hunters and concede some bullets instead or whether he is decently shooting countless 'Blue Coats' with a captured machine gun or appearing out of the sun to terrify a band of Indians into thinking he is an 'army of one' or pulling the triggers of his empty guns over and over again he remains superhuman and invincible... It is Eastwood's screen presence as something unique direct and strong the essential Eastwood persona that is a powerful attraction to the public and an enigma to the critics... Josey Wales has no desire to become an outlaw... At the beginning of the film he is a peaceable Missouri farmer whose wife and child are murdered by Unionist vigilantes the 'Kansas Red Legs.' The film opens in 1858 when the semidiscipline of the Civil War has been reduced to the chaos of marauding private armies... Wales joins a bunch of desperate Confederate fighters led by Commander Fletcher John Vernon and for the next seven years intensifies a multiple revenge on the Unionists killing them without political cause or pity...At the end of formal hostilities a price is placed on his head so he makes a picaresque journey into the Indian nation... On the way he picks up different companions Jamie Sam Bottoms a young soldier he saves and who repays the favor only to die from his wounds Lone Watie Chief Dan George who instructs him in the ways and thoughts of the Cherokees Little Moonlight Geraldine Keams the Navajo girl who suffers injustice from the white man's civilization Grandma Sarah Paula Trueman the old woman who knows how to shoot marauders and Laura Lee Sondra Locke whom he rescues from a rape...After surviving the dangers of their journey under the protective wing of Josey the group settles on a farm formerly owned by Sarah's son who has died in the war... Wales tries to pass his selfsufficient qualities onto them so that they can if necessary survive without him... He shows them how to use guns and protect the farm against invaders and negotiates a peace with the bluepainted Navajo Chief Ten Bears Will Sampson.Eastwood plays a solitary figure who is not simply an avenger or a fugitive with a gun... He is a man who at the same time defends women and children and the weak... His love affair with Laura is triggered off by such wistful sentiments as 'clouds are dreams floating across the sky of your mind' but it rings true that a man blinkered by revenge and hardened by the sheer need to survive could be drawn to an innocent girl able to escape from the terrors of her environment into the poetry of her reveries... This was the first of six films that Eastwood would make with Sondra Locke who has already won an Oscar nomination in her film debut 'The Heat Is a Lonely Hunter.' Chief Dan George who received an Oscar nomination for playing Old Lodge Skins in Arthur Penn's 'Little Big Man' is terrific as the aging Indian warrior Lone Watie... He calls himself a civilized Indian  We're civilized because white men can sneak up on us.' He struck up a perfect partnership with Eastwood sensitively timing the soft humor in their relationship... When Josey casually outdraws and kills four men the Old Indian asks with genuine interest 'How did you know which one to kill first?'".

	schema:reviewBody "THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES is a wonderful story about a wounded man Josey Wales a Missourian who has lost his home and his family to the Civil War. As the Civil War ends in defeat and despair for the South Wales alone of his guerrilla unit refuses to surrender. He has nothing left to live for except to fight and he cannot give that up.This is a setup that has appeared many times in the movies as the hero with nothing left to lose is a perfect excuse to show nonstop gunplay. To some extent this happens in THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES too. It is an action western according to the classic formula but it is more than that. Josey Wales heals his wounds as the story goes on and begins to replace the friendship and then the love that he has lost. And as he heals he begins to grow out of violence as a way of life. Many westerns have the theme of the older breed of man who tamed the west by violence being abandoned by his fellows only this one so far as I know has the older breed of man abandon himself that is to say change his ways with the changing of the times.Clint Eastwood is a decent actor not a great one. But at times he has shown the skills of a really firstclass director and given his limitations as an actor it is the more to his credit that he did not hog the stage. He gives plenty of screen time to an excellent supporting cast of whom the most memorable is Chief Dan George as aged Cherokee warrior Lone Watie a role he plays with an eerily perfect balance of dignity and humor. Will Sampson makes an unforgettable cameo as Comanche chief Ten Bears and Paula Trueman is a magnificently feisty Sarah. John Vernon plays Fletcher the man who betrays Josey Wales early on. I don't understand why Vernon could not find work in quality movies after this he has appeared in 38 cinema releases since this movie and I challenge you to name any of them. Vernon has one of THE great bassoprofundo voices in American cinema only James Earl Jones could compare to it. If mountains could speak they would sound like John Vernon. His role is a neat twist on the trope of the 'reluctant hero' Fletcher is a reluctant villain.The ending of THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES is the most beautiful and poetic of any in western movie history maybe the most beautiful of any movie ever. According to the rules of the genre the final confrontation between Wales and Fletcher can have only one outcome the movie finds another way because Josey Wales has found another way.Rating  out of .Recommendation Western fans should own this one but any movie fan should enjoy it.".

Not many films manage to deal competently with even just one of these topics. This masterpiece deals with all. Within the first 4 or 5 minutes even before the opening credits one has already been exposed to more force and emotion than most films can pack up in 90 minutes.By the end of the 2 hrs 10 minutes of this film one would have lived through tourdeforce highlighted by memorable climaxes and showdowns featuring some of the most striking dialogue in cinematic history... dying ain't no way to make a living. Eastwood's character doesn't speak much but utters a handful of memorable lines.The central character played by Eastwood is given fine support by an excellent ensemble cast including Chief Dan George Sondra Locke Bill McKinney and most of all John Vernon. John Vernon plays a character called Fletcher who turns out to be one of the most complex characters I have ever come across. His motivations and true intentions are never quite clear. He comes across as a bit of a Judas figure and yet he still retains his humanity as the script and Eastwood as the director never truly judge Fletcher leaving the viewer to judge for him or herself. Almost every character is memorable and every performance fits in place.The action is sudden and explosive and not always expected. The film takes many twists and turns yet every twist is a natural consequence of the situations and characters in the film. Ultimately one is left with a truly rich cinematic experience which should appeal to more than just fans of the Western genre. Its themes of suffering and the consequences of evil acts is still sadly relevant in today's world  a world in which not all wars are won by the good guys and in which the good are sometimes persecuted by those who win these wars.When thinking of the best precredit sequences ever forget most others... this should be your best bet.".

The latter is really a drama more than a western.This is simply an extremely entertaining story with two lead characters  played by Eastwood and Chief Dan George  who were fascinating to watch. Also as in most westerns I enjoyed the good photography and was surprised considering the year of release that the language was pretty tame.George has always been a favorite Native American actor for many people. He gets choice roles playing likable guys and Lone Watie character here is no exception. Eastwood as  Josey Wales reverts successfully back to his Man with no name persona you know the strong silent and somewhat mean type. He's a lot like the characters John Wayne played late in his career. He best portrays this with scenes like the one in which he spits tobacco on his dog!In addition there are some solid actors in minor roles people like John Vernon Sondra Locke and Bill McKinney Will Sampson Sheb Wooley and Sam Bottoms among others. I was surprised Locke Eastwood's girlfriend or wife at the time didn't have a bigger role. With her youthful looks and great big eyes she looked prettier than I've ever seen her although she never was a glamor girl or got many good parts.At 136 minutes this is a bit long but it never drags. This is one of the very few movies I ever watched twice within two weeks and enjoyed it immensely both times....and each time since.".

It represents what a true western is. The story line is captivating and intense. The lead character played by Clint himself could be played by no one else. What some may call lack of acting because of lack of dialog only lends itself to the desirability of this film. You find yourself hanging on his next words. Clints one liners are still household expressions nearly thirty years after the movies release. In short this film is one of the best westerns made period. There have been others that Clint has made including the spaghetti westerns and his Oscar winning Unforgiven that add to his credibility as a great actor and film maker. But not many films touch so many levels of emotion. The only letdown to this film is that it had to end and no sequel was followed by Clint. Lastly it's too bad for the film industry and Eastwood fans like myself that the man has to get old. His take on what entertains an audience is uncompromising. Films like The outlaw Josie Wales and what it represents to the American Culture will be enjoyed for many years to come.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Outlaw Josie Wales was made by Clint Eastwood at a time when westerns were out of favor and the public wanted more of Clint as Dirty Harry. This film as it turned out was one of Clint's best and certainly ranks up there with the more popular Unforgiven 1992.Josie Wales Eastwood is a dirt farmer in Missouri during the American Civil War. One day a group of yankee raiders led by Captain Red Legs Terrill Bill McKinny attacks and burns his farm and murders his wife and young son while leaving Josie for dead. As Josie ponders what to do next a group of southern raiders led by Bloody Bill Anderson John Russell takes him into his gang to seek his revenge.After the South surrenders a fellow southerner Fletcher John Vernon offers the remaining members of Anderson's gang amnesty if they will swear allegiance to the North. All but Wales agree. Unbeknownst to Fletcher the men are suddenly murdered by the Union soldiers led by Terrill and in spite of Josie's efforts only he and a young soldier names Jamie Sam Bottoms escape. Terrill and Fletcher are sent to hunt down the fugitives.Jamie soon dies from his wounds and Josie is left alone. He makes for Mexico but is joined first by Lone Watie Chief Dan George then Little Moonlight Geraldine Kearns whom Josie rescues from a trading post and finally Laura Lee Sondra Locke and Grandma Sarah Paula Trueman who he rescues from a gang of Commancheros.The group makes for Texas where Grandma Sarah's son has left her a ranch. All the time Josie is being pursued by Terrill and assorted bounty hunters. Josie dispatches several of them with his brace of Colt 45 horse pistols.Finally at the ranch the group sets up a home and Josie begins to fall for Laura Lee. Fearing an Indian attack Josie rides to meet with Chief Ten Bears Will Sampson and makes peace with him. But finally Terrill and his group of Red Legs tracks Josie down and..........Eastwood who also directed the movie plays Wales with his usual grim faced persons. He's not afraid to pull his pistols and dispose of anyone who stands in his way. Interestingly enough Eastwood cast all of the principal Native roles with native actors and treated them as equals and not in the old Hollywood tradition.An excellent western in every way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Certainly Clint Eastwood's best complete movie the story of a man drawn into hell by the inhumanity of others specifically the Redlegs and the Senator who is redeemed by the humanity of others the settlers Lone Wattie and Ten Bears to recover some semblance of a life after the Civil War.  Eastwood's acting is economical but a far cry from the manwithnoname character he made famous and carries the story very well and his directing style is practically invisible which is exactly what it should be  if the director does his job you should never even notice his contribution.  The viewer is entirely caught up in the story of the man. All in all a brilliant bit of film from Eastwood who clearly learned everything he could from his own directors and then combined that knowledge into superb craftsmanship of his own.   It is interesting to contrast the Jose Wales and Billy Munny from Unforgiven characters.  Wales seeks to regain his humanity through others Munny  having regained his humanity from being a Waleslike character at the beginning of the movie  descends willingly into a hell of his own choosing.".

	onyx:emotionText "Certainly Clint Eastwood's best complete movie the story of a man drawn into hell by the inhumanity of others specifically the Redlegs and the Senator who is redeemed by the humanity of others the settlers Lone Wattie and Ten Bears to recover some semblance of a life after the Civil War.  Eastwood's acting is economical but a far cry from the manwithnoname character he made famous and carries the story very well and his directing style is practically invisible which is exactly what it should be  if the director does his job you should never even notice his contribution.  The viewer is entirely caught up in the story of the man. All in all a brilliant bit of film from Eastwood who clearly learned everything he could from his own directors and then combined that knowledge into superb craftsmanship of his own.   It is interesting to contrast the Jose Wales and Billy Munny from Unforgiven characters.  Wales seeks to regain his humanity through others Munny  having regained his humanity from being a Waleslike character at the beginning of the movie  descends willingly into a hell of his own choosing.";

I said A SPOILER?? What happens to Terrill the chief red leg at the end of this film is more in line with the fate I envisioned early in the going for Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York. It is spectacular painful to watch and more than a touch grisly. But it is not so overblown and RoboCopesque that you can't imagine such a pivotal moment actually happening that way. The ending of The Outlaw Josey Wales is in a word what the ending of Gangs would have been if the focus groups and script doctors and the Great Scorcese had gotten the thing right.Ten stars.See it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Outlaw Josey Wales is directed by Clint Eastwood who also stars as Wales and is adapted by Sonia Chernus  Phil Kaufman from the novel The Rebel Outlaw Josey Wales written by Forrest Carter. Joining Eastwood in the cast are Chief Dan George Sondra Locke Bill McKinney John Vernon  Paula Trueman. Music is by Jerry Fielding and Bruce Surtees photographs on location in Utah Arizona  Wyoming.We are at the very end of the American Civil War and Josey Wales is a contented family man working on his Missouri farm. But his peaceful world is shattered when Union soldiers raid his home and murder his wife and child. Surviving the attack Josey takes up arms with a group of Confederate guerrilla fighters who take the fight to the Redlegs. However when the news comes that the war is over and the Confederates are required to surrender Josey refuses to do so. A wise choice since his group are rounded up and slaughtered in cold blood. So Josey is forced to go on the lam as an outlaw where hot on his trail are the Redleg group fronted by bloodthirsty Captain Terrill. On his way as he contemplates survival and what life has in store for he and his aggressors Josey acquires some interesting companions.Acclaimed by the critics upon its release The Outlaw Josey Wales is ageing like a fine wine. It's a film Eastwood himself is very proud of citing it as one of the high points in his career. Yet the film got off to a difficult start. It was originally given to Kaufman to direct with Eastwood's Malpaso company producing but the star and director fell out over Kaufman's directing style  and that a certain Sondra Locke was turning the heads of both men. As we now know there was only one winner there.The story is a classic Western tale hell it's a powerful tale one with layers that peel off as the film progresses. Josey Wales starts out a peaceful family man but after having that stripped away from him by violence he too is forced to take up violence in response. So far so formulaic then. But the film is so much more than just a Western revenge yarn even if that aspect of the story is darn good as Clint gets mean and broody and pulls his pistols. There's a real strong family thread throughout from losing his own kin in the beginning  to a father son relationship  and on to the way he acquires a new family on his travels it's very strong and gives the narrative a real emotional kick. As Josey goes on his way angry bitter and prepared to face the consequence of his choices the character is constantly forming. It was only after a number of viewings that I personally realised that Josey Wales the man was being healed by the ragtag assortment of individuals that he collects on route to his character being rebuilt.Eastwood the actor here is on fine form cool and every inch a man's man . But even Eastwood wouldn't decry the scene stealing excellence of Chief Dan George as Lone Watie. His dry wit puts him in the top tier of Western comedy sidekicks but rest assured the character is more than that. For Watie acts as a sort of spiritual mentor to Wales and Eastwood reacts positively to George's serene acting to give the film its tight bonded centre. The rest of the cast are a much of a muchness but all serve the story well with solid performances. In fact it's a rare occasion when Locke's vacant method acting actually works well! Eastwood the director is calm assured and subtle in pacing with his storytelling boosted considerably by Fielding's popping score and Surtees' gorgeous cinematography. The script is awash with attentive dialogue and punching moments of humour whilst its noticeable denouncement of violence and intelligent portrayals of the Indians is to be roundly applauded.Iconography unbound and bulging with class in the writing The Outlaw Josey Wales is not just one of Eastwoods best Westerns. It's one of the best Westerns period. I reckon so. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "The thing that I love about all of the Westerns that Clint Eastwood directed is their moral complexity. He isn't content to tell a story where the heroes and villains are dressed allinblack or allinwhite so to speak. His characters are presented with difficult choices. Should Josey choose the path of justice and revenge or the path of peace reintegration and submission? Within the moral framework of the movie these paths are mutually exclusive and neither is completely satisfactory. It is painfully clear that from the moment Josey picks up a gun to avenge his slain family he will never be able to return to a life of peace although he will want to. But what other choice does he really have? What makes this movie amazing is that the main character is clearly cognizant of this moral struggle. In the briefest flickers of expression on Clint Eastwood's face and in the well chosen word we see that although this man is supernaturally good at killing people he doesn't LIKE it. He would rather have been left alone on his farm with his wife and child than to have been dragged into the damn war. He also goes out of his way at times to avoid conflict. i.e. giving the bounty hunter a chance to walk away bargaining with Ten Bears rather than making war. He remembers peace and he wants it as symbolized by his attraction to Sandra Locke's character. But it will always be out of his reach.I think that Clint Eastwood is singlehandedly responsible for elevating the Western to an art form higher than Greek drama. My argument is that in Greek drama the characters are trapped by circumstance doomed to act in a certain way. Yet it is only at the end of the play that they realize their actions have led to their demise. In this movie Josey Wales seems painfully aware at every second that his actions will have consequences both for himself and those around him. Yet his actions are dictated by strict rules of circumstance and honor and in any given situation his choices are pretty limited. And he knows it! How's that for tragedy? Eyes wideopen he plays his cards the best way he knows how and still he ends the movie gutshot and estranged from the things he loves.My favorite scene from this movie by the way is when he finally tracks down Captain Redlegs Terrell and kills him with his own sword. In the hands of a lesser actordirector this could have been a neat scene where scores are settled loose ends are tidiedup and moral satifaction is achieved. But it isn't. In the seconds after he kills his nemesis Clint Eastwood's face momentarily conveys a sense of disgust disappointment and even horror at what he has just done. Revenge has been exacted but it brings no satisfaction and doesn't bring back the dead.I think part of Eastwood's brilliance as a director and actor is how with just a few lines of dialogue and a glimmer of facial expression he can communicate volumes of moral complexity. It is a minimalism that places an unusual amount of trust in the audience. Not many directors believe that audiences can follow their characters into dark and morally ambiguous places. Eastwood not only believes that they can but that he can take them there without a lot of sissy handholding and unnecessary exposition.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sixteen years before the unforgettable Unforgiven 1992 Eastwood delivered this genre classic at a time where New Hollywood had confidently taken over and outside of Italy's fledgling film industry Western was no longer on the agenda. America's selfunderstanding as a conquering nation had been dealt a traumatic blow in Vietnam and hence tales of fearless and godfearing conquistadors seemed at best inappropriate. Well into his transgressive Dirty Harry stints Eastwood plays one Josey Wales a farmer who is caught in the horrors of the Civil War and turns against his tormentors with a vengeance. The figure of Wales which shares essential features with both the earlier Harry Callahan and the later William Munny is the epitome of an Eastwoodian character freighted with a moral ambiguity that is still likely to puzzle viewers today. A constituting factor of his lone riders is the outward defiance of authority where it is deficient providing the moral justification for an individual to take the law into his hands. Josey Wales was unjustly harmed by the Union forces who represent the State and will fight them down come what will. Incidentally Eastwood's positive depiction of Natives throughout his career fits in neatly with this ethical code the State having stripped them of their rights calling for individual action outside the boundaries of the law or selfempowerment if you will. Both the Natives and Josey Wales are outcasts and by way of this ostracism forced to become outlaws. The general feel of this film like so many others reflects Eastwood's nononsense directing. After all he boasts a reputation for making swift decisions doing with few takes and coming in below budget. The opening credit scenes are a case in point here instead of lengthy battle scenes Eastwood has his bunch of guerrilla fighters ride across the landscape and shoot at random enough to convey the essence of their action. The plot serves this purpose as well a brief precredits introduction Wales's family killed by the Union forces during a raid on his farm serves as the inciting incident and must suffice to lay down the hero's motives. From here on we may concentrate on Wales's adventures and eventually his inner conversion. It takes an immaculate female to bring this conversion about a virgin who can be seen as the embodiment of the hippie movement and a Catholic figure of redemption alike  a perfect incarnation of Eastwood's trademark double entendre.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a contender for the title of Clint Eastwood's best western possibly even his best film. I'd seen it on television in pan and scan format and enjoyed it but it really needs to see watching in widescreen to fully appreciate the film.Clint Eastwood plays a Missouri farmer during the American civil war who joins Confederate fighters after his wife and son are murdered Kansas redlegs who are fighting with the Union. When the war is over his commander says that he is going to surrender to the Union and all the other men join him with the exception of Josey. When they are in the process of surrendering it turns out that it was a trap and the Union troops plan to murder them as they are being gunned down Josey rides in and rescues Jamie one of his friends who is badly wounded and kills many union troops in the process. The leader of the Redlegs and Fletcher Josey's former commander are tasked with hunting him down.Josey and Jamie head towards Texas encountering a few problems including a ferryman who will back either side depending who is paying and a couple of hillbillies hoping for the reward. Unfortunately Jamie dies before they enter the Indian Nation. Josey isn't alone for long as he soon joins with a Cherokee who fought with the Confederacy a young Navajo woman who he rescues from a trader and a mother and daughter from Kansas who he saved from a group of Comancheros. All of them continue to Texas where they head to the ranch that belonged the the elder Kansan woman's son. Here they prepare for conflict with the local Comanches but end up having to fight against the Redlegs who have finally caught up with Josey.The acting throughout the film is very good especially Clint Eastwood and Chief Dan George who played the Cherokee Lone Watie. As well as top rate acting Clint Eastwood proves himself to be a top rate director. The film is full of quotable dialogue but it never feels as if it has been spoken just to sound cool. I would certainly recommend this to all film lovers especially fans of Clint or Westerns... although I can't imagine many such people wouldn't have seen this yet.".

	schema:headline " Overlong but splendid Western well played and directed by Clint Eastwood as a farmer turns outlaw when Union soldiers kill his family";
	schema:reviewBody "Interesting movie based on a novel by Forrest Carter titled Gone To Texas and professionally performed and directed by Clint Eastwood . Exciting film based on historical events set during American Civil War 18611865 in which the Bushwhackers use guerrilla warfare to destroy Yankee targets and led by men set on revenge make raid and surprising attacks . A Missouri peaceful farmer named Josey Wales Clint Eastwood whose family is killed by Red Legs a bunch of pillaging outlaws who have allied themselves with the Union Army  he then turns vigilante . After the war  everyone in his troop surrenders to the victorious Unin except Wales . There take place fights between cutthroat Bushwhackers versus Jayhawkers  including historical characters named Quantrill and Bloody Bill Anderson John Russell who carried out an infamous Raid on Lawrence Kansas . The surrendering detachment are then murdered after being promised amnesty . Then Wales in turn has a price on his head and joins a Confederate guerrilla unit to revenge their deaths and winds up on the run along with a motley group Sam Bottoms  Chief Dan George  Sondra Locke from the Union soldiers who murdered his family and undertaking a lethal chase .The picture compellingly describes the atmosphere of violence set in postCivil War  in which women have few rights and took place confrontation among bands and bloody battles . This thrilling as well as violent flick details a bloody vendetta  propelling a catandmouse pursuit odyssey . Although atmospheric  it's also sometimes slowmoving and winds up into a spectacular showdown . Very good production design  including breathtaking attacks and fights  as the film contains some of the most wild horse scenes ever recorded and kept in a movie . The scenes of the picture were filmed in Lake Powell Arizona WyomingGlen Canyon Utah Kanab Paria Utah Oroville Utah and Mescal Arizona . Nice acting by Eastwood in his usual stoic attitude as the outlaw becomes the hunter and the hunted . In fact  Clint Eastwood cites Josey as his personal favorite of all the movies he's made . And this is the first of six movies made by reallife couple Clint Eastwood and Sondra Locke. Very good support cast plenty of familiar faces such as Chief Dan George  Bill McKinney . John Vernon  Paula Trueman as Grandma Sarah  Sam Bottoms  Joyce Jameson  John Davis Chandler  Will Sampson  Doug McGrath  John Russell  Charles Tyner  Matt Clark  among others . And uncredited Kyle Eastwood  in film debut  can be glimpsed very briefly in the opening sequence helping his dad Josey work the land by their home . Thrilling and atmospheric musical score by Jerry Fielding  Sam Peckinpah's usual . Colorful and adequate cinematography shot in Panavision by Bruce Surtees  great cameraman Robert Surtees's son.This masterpiece of characterization  adventure and action was efficiently directed by Clint Eastwood  however  the movie received mixed reviews on its release . Clint took over filmmaking from Philip Kaufman who also cowrote the script  a rule which has ever since been titled the Eastwood rule . It is Clint's one of the best films as both a player and filmmaker and being followed by The return of Josey Wales with no participation by Clint Eastwood . Star producer  director Eastwood realizes an excellent film and perfectly directed . This classic Western as good as the notorious Pale rider is magnificent in every way . Later on  Eastwood produced and directed another successful Western  the Oscarized Unforgiven1992 also with some common theme.".

For starters the film is based on a novel and it is also known that Eastwood fired the man who was going to direct it Philip Kaufman also the screenwriter when the project was already in an advanced stage.Clint Eastwood stars as Josie Whales a pacific farmer who sees his family killed during the American Civil war and who not having any good reason to live but to achieve revenge joins the suddist irregulars. And here the strange things start to ocurr because after the beginning credits the war is over and Whales is in more or less the same state where we left him. A series of events turn him into a fugitive with literally every bounty hunter in the territory after him and his dry sullen persona starts to evolve as his journey towards Kansas progresses and he joins some of the most peculiar travel partners ever to grace a western a young kid Sam Bottons a disenchanted Indian chief Chief Dan George an Indian woman who speaks in an unintelligible tongue a dog a puritan woman and her aloof young daughter played by Sondra Locke future companion and regular screen partner of Eastwood.It is a wonderful film really but as I said it is VERY strange. It starts as your usual Eastwood vehicle although Eastwood's tone as a director is even more laconic and dryly humorous than usual but as the journey progresses new characters are introduced and Wales himself starts to change developing just like the film itself and underlying schizophrenia. Wales is teared apart as the film goes between his desire for revenge and thus ending with his inner torment and the newly found desire to reintegrate to society he's been a loner for years as the film starts as he founds himself as the leader of some sort of dysfunctional even interracial family.This inner conflict is also transferred to the film itself which seems to eternally debate between historical and genre accuracy this must be the most historical of all Eastwood films as it is based on historical events and several real figures like Quantril are mentioned and Eastwood's desire to shortcircuit it with dry humour and antiarcheotypical character allegiances.This alone should make it a must see for all westerns aficionados but it should also be noted that this is one of Eastwood's finest directing efforts. Attention to detail is overwhelming notice for instance the use of period songs and the cinematography is absolutely riveting coating the interiors with persistent shadows and washing out the familiar landscapes with invernal light. Kudos for the supporting cast specially Chief Dan George are also obligatory.".

Obviously inspired by Jesse James Wales' is a fugitive out for revenge against the Union forces who had wronged he and his family. Unlike James Wales does not explicitly rely upon banditry for his living although it is sometimes implied.There is a great deal to like about the movie. The characters interactions are great with much deadpan humor and highly quotable lines. The action is very good with Josey shooting himself out of a number of sticky situations. Eastwood even manages to squeeze in a moral message or two regarding the Civil War and the Indian Wars.My criticisms are few given the overall appeal here. Most of the villains were very onedimensional and despicable with several performing the typically dumb moves to set them up for the protagonist's bullets. And Wales like most Western heroesis a dead eye with the gun  not a single shot fired missed its mark.In the end though it still tops my list of favorite westerns.

	schema:reviewBody "As The Outlaw Josey Wales Clint Eastwood is ideal as a wary fast drawing loner akin to the Man with no name from his European westerns. But unlike that other mythic outlaw Josey Wales has a name and a heart. That heart opens up as the action unfolds. After avenging his family's brutal murder Wales is pursued by a pack of killers. He prefers to travel alone but ragtag outcasts are drawn to him and Wales can't bring himself to leave them unprotected. The Outlaw Josey Wales was released in 1976 and it stars Clint Eastwood Sondra Locke  John Vernon. In my opinion this is no where near one of Eastwood's best films don't get me wrong it is a good film but Eastwood has had much better for example Dirty Harry True Crime Magnum Force Coogan's Bluff and The Enforcer. Good but overrated".

But unlike that other mythic outlaw Josey Wales has a name and a heart. That heart opens up as the action unfolds. After avenging his family's brutal murder Wales is pursued by a pack of killers. He prefers to travel alone but ragtag outcasts are drawn to him and Wales can't bring himself to leave them unprotected. The Outlaw Josey Wales was released in 1976 and it stars Clint Eastwood Sondra Locke  John Vernon. In my opinion this is no where near one of Eastwood's best films don't get me wrong it is a good film but Eastwood has had much better for example Dirty Harry True Crime Magnum Force Coogan's Bluff and The Enforcer. Good but overrated";

	schema:reviewBody "By the 1970s the classic Western seemed to have come full circle through genre clich and elegy and was now going through an era of surrealism and selfreference from cheeky comedies like Little Big Man to horrortinged bloodbaths like High Plains Drifter. However with 1976's The Outlaw Josey Wales this wave of strange and violent Westerns gains a little perspective on itself.Have no doubt The Outlaw Josey Wales is an action Western but it has an overriding theme of making peace and learning to have a life after conflict. It essentially presents the typical toughjawed Clint Eastwood shooting his way through dozens of hoodlums with barely credible dexterity but then gradually having his humanity restored by an unlikely family of sorts that he picks up on his way. As such it's ultimately a rather heartwarming affair. And amazingly this humane streak is not at the expense of the necessary business of gunning down men four at a time. There is a little prologue in which we see Eastwood as a meek little farmer witnessing his family get butchered. This version of Eastwood is perhaps a little too ineffectual for us to fully accept his transition to a hardhearted badass but enough happens in the meantime to make us forget the prologue only for to be reminded of it in the picture's final act as some surreal dream of the life that once was with renewed impact.As an actor Clint Eastwood was of course born to play the toughjawed Clint Eastwood type but he handles the more peaceable aspects of the Josey Wales character with rather mixed success. He looks appropriately awkward towards the end when attempting to dance with Sondra Locke but his attempt at being the humble little fellow who gets his face slashed in the prologue is a really terrible bit of acting. The highlights of the movie however are really the supporting players. Chief Dan George is wonderfully deadpan bringing a little hint of irony to even his most serious speeches. Paula Trueman is very good too playing the feisty old lady stereotype with far more realism than one generally sees.This was Eastwood's second Western as a director. The influence of his mentor Sergio Leone shows through with action scenes preceded by lots of meanfaced closeups and made up of quick bursts of gunfire. But there's something that Eastwood does with the space that is very unlike the rolling vistas of Leone's work. Eastwood uses tight framing and close backgrounds to enclose each shot as if fending off the Western landscape and even defying the width of the 'scope aspect ratio. Throughout we are encouraged to see the people not the place. What landscape we do see is wintry and spiky a harsh and atypical look.And this is still in many ways a harsh and atypical Western. Although it certainly brings back some sense of hope and humanity to an increasingly brutal genre it is still very much of its time. There is no wistful harking back to the classic oaters of the previous generation. This is High Plains Drifter with a silver lining. And it is perhaps just what the Western needed at that time.".

Capturing him he is taken to an institute for deaf and mute children. From there he is used as little more than an exhibit.Having read of his story Jean Itard a Parisian doctor played by Truffaut himself makes it his goal to integrate this wild child' into society. What follows is an astonishing tale of a boy completely deprived of all human contact as he adapt to life in an unfamiliar structured society. Named simply Victor' by Dr Itard we watch as kindly doctor attempts to educate and communicate with this unusual child. We see Victor's first smiles we hear his first intelligible sounds and witness for the first time his tears.This is a deeply powerful film directed brilliantly by Truffaut and far surpassing his earlier and much more critically acclaimed 400 Blows'. JeanPierre Cargol plays Victor with a remarkable passion and is absolutely convincing as this child of the forest. His mannerisms his posture his very presence would have one believing he genuinely was a wild child'.Truffaut follows this story with startling accuracy  based on the real life journals of Dr Itard his adaptation is faithful to the last. His portrayal of the Doctor is filled with compassion and a tenderness rarely seen in films.This is genuine pleasure to watch and is a testament to enduring spirit of mankind. The main criticism I have is the abrupt ending. We are left with so many unanswered questions. In truth the real Victor' died approximately 28 years after his first encounter with Itard.  I know little of what happened during the time span between the end of the film and his death but I intend to find out. This film is only a glance at a boy being introduced to a strange frightening and unfamiliar world.It is not without its moments of humour. The scene where Victor practically throws the doctor tending to Itard from the house is both funny and charming while remaining delicately underplayed.Everything about this film works so well from the minimalist photography to the classical score. The casting could not have been better. Truffaut presents himself as not only an accomplished director but also as an inspired actor. JeanPierre Cargol is utterly believable and thoroughly likeable as Victor and mention must go to Franoise Seigner as Madame Geurin Itard's housekeeper and the child's carer.This is a very special film which deserves a great deal of respect. The visual transfer to DVD is accurate and crisp and the mono soundtrack subtle clear and effective. This is one DVD which would have greatly benefited from some extras. Perhaps some insight into Victors' life from adolescence to his death and some information on what became of Itard. Lack of extras notwithstanding this should still be very high on anyone's shopping list and is highly recommended. I believe this was Truffauts' crowning achievement and is a truly beautiful and inspiring film.Reviewed by Ollie".

His mannerisms his posture his very presence would have one believing he genuinely was a wild child'.Truffaut follows this story with startling accuracy  based on the real life journals of Dr Itard his adaptation is faithful to the last. His portrayal of the Doctor is filled with compassion and a tenderness rarely seen in films.This is genuine pleasure to watch and is a testament to enduring spirit of mankind. The main criticism I have is the abrupt ending. We are left with so many unanswered questions. In truth the real Victor' died approximately 28 years after his first encounter with Itard.  I know little of what happened during the time span between the end of the film and his death but I intend to find out. This film is only a glance at a boy being introduced to a strange frightening and unfamiliar world.It is not without its moments of humour. The scene where Victor practically throws the doctor tending to Itard from the house is both funny and charming while remaining delicately underplayed.Everything about this film works so well from the minimalist photography to the classical score. The casting could not have been better. Truffaut presents himself as not only an accomplished director but also as an inspired actor. JeanPierre Cargol is utterly believable and thoroughly likeable as Victor and mention must go to Franoise Seigner as Madame Geurin Itard's housekeeper and the child's carer.This is a very special film which deserves a great deal of respect. The visual transfer to DVD is accurate and crisp and the mono soundtrack subtle clear and effective. This is one DVD which would have greatly benefited from some extras. Perhaps some insight into Victors' life from adolescence to his death and some information on what became of Itard. Lack of extras notwithstanding this should still be very high on anyone's shopping list and is highly recommended. I believe this was Truffauts' crowning achievement and is a truly beautiful and inspiring film.Reviewed by Ollie";

This child has the ability to evoke every primal human emotion without doing anything but making sounds and using facial expressions. Perhaps only a child could be capable of doing this but I doubt any child could do it as well. We feel sympathy for him and want to care for him ourselves at the same time that we are anxious about the deep mystery he forces us to recognize. The scene when he is rocking under the full moon and the look on his face as the movie ends are brilliant and frightening. The fact that this actor to my knowledge has done nothing since adds to the effect. Where did he go? Might he have been more in touch with this side of humanity than just as an actor? Just incredible. And Truffault's direction was perfect as well. Filmed in a minimalist style and cleverly utilizing early film techniques he evokes a time period yet allows no distraction from the actual issues involved in the story. The viewer is forced to pay attention and forced to deal with the issues confronting the doctor and his relationship with the boy. I cannot recommend this highly enough.".

But somehow it does Truffaut laces the film with a kind of undertone of logic for the audience how can a boy for most of his life be out in the wild and become suddenly domesticated while making a sort of nature versus society statement. The film also has the director's trademark lightness which helps to not make the film's subject matter too bleak or disparaging. For it could be Truffaut actually gives a kind of suspense to the narrative at times that just when you think Victor is on his way to success he stumbles and starts to act out on the floor or escape into the wild for a breather. It's a very curious film not just because Truffaut in one of his few times gives himself the starring role but also that the child like Makim Munzak in Kurosawa's Dersu Uzala had his only significant role ever in the film. And it's quite the seemingly impulsive and always alive performance that filmmaker's rarely get out of children.Victor is named this only halfway through the film and it starts off with him being chased by a small mob and their dogs through the woods. It's maybe the most exciting part of the film but then this segways into the early stages of the boy's troubles. He's placed in a deaf and dumb school beat up by the other kids and still with the passions and intelligence that the woods have given him. It becomes a fascination in the story of what the limits if any are for him to learn everything real boys do. Once he's put into Dr. Itard's Truffaut care then the film sets off onto a very direct path how will he learn will he and how long will it it take? As with his other films the literary aspect kicks in as the scientist takes repeated notes on the boy using a kind of preDarwinian way of scientific methods. But it's within the little moments in the film like when Victor is out on his walks or makes his little successes where Truffaut as a filmmaker picks up the best parts of the film.This could be a very routine picture and for some it may actually be a little dull and disheartening. Will the boy ever learn? The film actually does raise questions within its format as it is based on a true case from taking science classes I know there are also others of this kind as well. It brings to mind about what is pure and delicate about the ways of an animal and what separates them and humans. Each little test becomes dramatic conflict in the structure Truffaut puts forth and in a way it's rather experimental. And it even becomes delightful in certain scenes like when he first learns how to ask for milk and then this expands. This along with a sweet Vivaldi score in the background and interesting visuals love the iris usage makes it a worthwhile entry in Truffaut's oeuvre. Not one of his absolute best but up there.".

The interaction between Victor and Dr. Itard was splendidly done. It was a joy simply to watch Truffaut on screen directing the boy's progress much like he must have done offscreen to get some very human reactions. At no point during this film did I think a scene was overdone or unnatural. It just seemed to flow from one small triumph to the next. My only complaint was that the whole experiment ended abrubtly and so too did the movie. We are told by Dr. Itard that Victor is a extraordinary boy but he has much training left to master. There were many points along the way where doubt lingered as to whether the wild child could be fully trained at all until the final scene. There we learn that Victor has a new home.This movie was based on a true event which took place in the late 1700s. Unfortunately for the audience the most pressing question of what became of Victor in his adult life is left unanswered. But fans of Francois Truffaut will find him even more engaging than in his role of Claude Lacombe in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The roles are similar in many ways. If Lacombe could have taken home the childlike aliens to instruct I'm sure he would have been much like Dr. Itard.".

I therefore wanted to play the role of Dr. Itard myself in order to deal with him myself and thus avoid going through an intermediary. Admittedly Truffaut's performance is not the film's strongest suit compared to Cargol who plays Victor or its luminous blackandwhite cinematography and scrupulous period detail.

	schema:reviewBody "The child later named Victor who is found living in the woods in France is very much in a state of nature according to Hobbes and Rousseau. Hobbes viewed the state of nature as people living savage lives that consisted of competition for necessities such as food and shelter. Victor probably lived a life in this fashion due to the scars he had on his body. He probably competed with animals for food and had to fight them for his own protection. In Hobbes' moral theory he states that men are directed by their appetites and aversions to judge what is good or evil. They basically act on impulse. Victor did not have any concept of how to treat another human being. He kicked and hit other people when they would try to get near him.It could be argued that Victor was not treated morally as a human being because he was placed in an institution as a show animal for the media. One of the researchers ended up taking Victor to his home where he established a relationship with him and tried to educate him. At one point to determine if Victor understands morality the researcher wrongly punishes him after he completes a task successfully. Victor fought back and the researcher realized he understood right from wrong.Rousseau believed men in the state of nature to be animals with reasoning. As the human learns more they will desire more. Man is drawn out of the first state of nature which causes him to lose innocence of not entirely knowing good and evil. This theory could be applied to Victor because he learned what is acceptable and what is not because of the researcher's teaching. Rousseau feels that in the state of nature there is a type of tranquility because you are innocent of right and wrong since you have never been taught morals. Humanity will never be able to return to this state according to Rousseau because they now know too much to return to the simple living in the state of nature. However Victor did not fully learn to communicate and only learned to speak the word milk in French. Towards the end of the movie Victor runs away from home only to return. Even though Victor did not completely master communication he learned enough to know that he would not enjoy returning to the solitude and survival mode he once lived in.".

The boy never learned how to speak giving us a defined window in which language acquisition occurs. Does his lack of formal ability to communicate mean he is less than us? Less civilized or less moral? Ultimately this movie causes you to question what exactly makes us human. How much of ourselves is pliable and defined simply by where we're born and who our parents are. There are many reports of other wild children just like Victor. Clearly our nature is much more changeable than many in our society would be comfortable admitting. While none of these questions are answered to a satisfactory standard we must still ponder these questions and how we define ourselves not only as individuals but also our society and our relationship to it as well as our culture.

	schema:reviewBody "Once in a while one stumbles upon a cinematic work whose presence refuses to fade within you even after its end credits have served their purpose of bringing one back to the same carefree state of mind as one enjoyed prior to seeing the movie. If scenes from the movie still turn up in your head on a daily basis weeks afterward and these make you ask new questions each time I think it may very well belong in that rare category. To me Franois Truffaut's L'Infant SAUVAGE THE WILD CHILD has provided such an experience. The story is set in the late 1700s covering the story of one Dr. Itard who is trying to raise and educate a child eventually named Victor who is thought to have been living with wild animals for his entire life.The film may appear to be be quite conventionally assembled relying as it does on a narrator's voice throughout and following a strictly accessible structure. However Traffaut's alert use of cameraangles as well as the beautiful cinematography often contributes considerably to certain points made in the story though one may not even realize this at first. For instance in one of the scenes depicting Dr. Itard's attempts at learning some of the obligatory knowledge of civilized society to Victor we are positioned from the outside of Itard's house granted a viewpoint through an open but still distancing window. It is a simple effect but makes us quietly conscious of the fact that we like Itard are observing another person's state of mind that of the wild child which we can never expect to understand and for that reason should probably be resistant of forcing upon our own worldview.Of at least equal merit as the direction are the performances Traffaut himself is very convincing as the firm but it must be assumed not illintentioned Itard while young JeanPierre Cargol strikes me as so unbelievably believable as Victor that it is aching to witness at times. Though superficially most viewers probably identify themselves with Itard's point of view I believe anyone who's been a child would find it hard not to somehow connect the confusion Victor seems to suffer with some instance of confusion oneself may have experienced in childhood no matter how mild that case of confusion may appear compared to what Victor goes through. At the same time it is worth noting that it is not necessarily Victor who is most puzzled Dr. Itard seems equally bewildered as to how to cope with Victor's state of mind as the other way around. Victor's understanding of the world is not necessarily wrong certainly not from his own point of view.Though generally said to be based on truth it has been noted that THE WILD CHILD does not quite follow the story as written down by the actual Itard. For one thing Itard was in fact still a student when he took it upon him to take care of Victor and not an educated physician and it has in later years been heavily doubted if Victor actually was brought up by wolves wolves taking care of another species seems very improbable in itself and even if it did occur Victor would hardly have survived ten years in the woods under such circumstances furthermore Victor reportedly wore some clothing when found if only barely. However more interesting than how much of what we see presented here is indisputable truth I think is how the film raises its questions and dilemmas. Itard needed to be portrayed as an educated physician for the sake of symbolic effect and whether or not Victor was raised by wild animals it still remains a fact that he understood the world vastly different than most human beings and was discovered at a time when it was not considered an inevitable alternative to give him a diagnosis a strong case of autism has later been suggested.Was it right to bring Victor into the civilized world though one assumed him to have lived by the laws of the animal kingdom for most of his life? Granted this question is perhaps not so interesting to discuss from an ethical standpoint. After all any reasonably empathic human being who found a naked seemingly abandoned child in the dark woods would instantly conclude that she should be brought to authorities of the civilized world to be taken care of irrelevant of whether such an act would deprive the child of the existence which she had come to view as normal due to hisher unusual circumstances. However one question worthy of discussion perhaps is whether the intentions behind the attempts of civilizing Victor were sufficiently justifiable?At the time Victor was found in the late 18th century still during the era of the French revolution parts of France suffered from poverty and uncertain prospects with families starving on the streets in the larger cities these were merely unfortunate ones. At the same time Victor from the woods was granted entrance into upper middleclass existence and its comforts and on what condition? That he could prove a valuable vessel to scientific experiments? If so the gradual development of Victor's emotional life is particularly tragic because though he learns to cry he is not able to handle emotions that reach beyond his natural instincts from a rational perspective.

	onyx:emotionText "Once in a while one stumbles upon a cinematic work whose presence refuses to fade within you even after its end credits have served their purpose of bringing one back to the same carefree state of mind as one enjoyed prior to seeing the movie. If scenes from the movie still turn up in your head on a daily basis weeks afterward and these make you ask new questions each time I think it may very well belong in that rare category. To me Franois Truffaut's L'Infant SAUVAGE THE WILD CHILD has provided such an experience. The story is set in the late 1700s covering the story of one Dr. Itard who is trying to raise and educate a child eventually named Victor who is thought to have been living with wild animals for his entire life.The film may appear to be be quite conventionally assembled relying as it does on a narrator's voice throughout and following a strictly accessible structure. However Traffaut's alert use of cameraangles as well as the beautiful cinematography often contributes considerably to certain points made in the story though one may not even realize this at first. For instance in one of the scenes depicting Dr. Itard's attempts at learning some of the obligatory knowledge of civilized society to Victor we are positioned from the outside of Itard's house granted a viewpoint through an open but still distancing window. It is a simple effect but makes us quietly conscious of the fact that we like Itard are observing another person's state of mind that of the wild child which we can never expect to understand and for that reason should probably be resistant of forcing upon our own worldview.Of at least equal merit as the direction are the performances Traffaut himself is very convincing as the firm but it must be assumed not illintentioned Itard while young JeanPierre Cargol strikes me as so unbelievably believable as Victor that it is aching to witness at times. Though superficially most viewers probably identify themselves with Itard's point of view I believe anyone who's been a child would find it hard not to somehow connect the confusion Victor seems to suffer with some instance of confusion oneself may have experienced in childhood no matter how mild that case of confusion may appear compared to what Victor goes through. At the same time it is worth noting that it is not necessarily Victor who is most puzzled Dr. Itard seems equally bewildered as to how to cope with Victor's state of mind as the other way around. Victor's understanding of the world is not necessarily wrong certainly not from his own point of view.Though generally said to be based on truth it has been noted that THE WILD CHILD does not quite follow the story as written down by the actual Itard. For one thing Itard was in fact still a student when he took it upon him to take care of Victor and not an educated physician and it has in later years been heavily doubted if Victor actually was brought up by wolves wolves taking care of another species seems very improbable in itself and even if it did occur Victor would hardly have survived ten years in the woods under such circumstances furthermore Victor reportedly wore some clothing when found if only barely. However more interesting than how much of what we see presented here is indisputable truth I think is how the film raises its questions and dilemmas. Itard needed to be portrayed as an educated physician for the sake of symbolic effect and whether or not Victor was raised by wild animals it still remains a fact that he understood the world vastly different than most human beings and was discovered at a time when it was not considered an inevitable alternative to give him a diagnosis a strong case of autism has later been suggested.Was it right to bring Victor into the civilized world though one assumed him to have lived by the laws of the animal kingdom for most of his life? Granted this question is perhaps not so interesting to discuss from an ethical standpoint. After all any reasonably empathic human being who found a naked seemingly abandoned child in the dark woods would instantly conclude that she should be brought to authorities of the civilized world to be taken care of irrelevant of whether such an act would deprive the child of the existence which she had come to view as normal due to hisher unusual circumstances. However one question worthy of discussion perhaps is whether the intentions behind the attempts of civilizing Victor were sufficiently justifiable?At the time Victor was found in the late 18th century still during the era of the French revolution parts of France suffered from poverty and uncertain prospects with families starving on the streets in the larger cities these were merely unfortunate ones. At the same time Victor from the woods was granted entrance into upper middleclass existence and its comforts and on what condition? That he could prove a valuable vessel to scientific experiments? If so the gradual development of Victor's emotional life is particularly tragic because though he learns to cry he is not able to handle emotions that reach beyond his natural instincts from a rational perspective. If it was right to force civilization upon Victor it was arguably done on the wrong basis.Anyhow these are just some of the questions I found myself asking. You may also watch the film for its fine performances and cinematography THE WILD CHILD can be enjoyed on several levels.";

	schema:reviewBody "One of the best foreign films and one of Franois Truffaut's best. Like 'The 400 Blows' it was directed by Truffaut but unlike that one he enters as an actor on this one.Despite the movie's title and the wild child in common it isn't related to the legendary story of 'The Jungle Book' or the wild child Mowgli. It's no remake or liveaction adaptation of that. It's in a class of its own. Besides it's based on a real story that happened in 1798. And despite the stylish colored cover it is actually in black and white.The 1st time I saw this film was when I was at high school. A teacher of mine brought us the movie to watch it. At the time I found it very interesting although I wasn't really at the right age to appreciate more mature films unlike now.This is the touching story of a child who is found in a forest living and acting like a wild animal and can't talk read write or understand any sort of language. This because the child was abandoned at an early age in the forest having spent many years in loneliness and without any contact with humans.When he is found and brought to an institution for deafmutes a doctor shows interest in the boy and takes him to his home. There the doctor and his housekeeper attempt to socialize and humanize the boy who is later named Victor as the boy immediately reacted to that name as if he liked it.Of course nobody can or should expect miracles. Naturally to socialize a child who spent so many years completely isolated from his own kind and society is everything except easy. These things take time and require the patience of a saint. Despite the notorious and relatively fast progresses considering his situation Victor's wild instincts don't totally disappear. It's not his fault though. He never manages to learn to talk aside from the word lait milk in french. But he learns to develop and demonstrate emotions and feelings.A good film. Also short. I think it could have been longer for I feel it ends all of a sudden. It could have shown more of Victor's fate.JeanPierre Cargol is superb as the wild child. We do feel for him. He really seems to be a wild child so realistic and believable is his acting. Franois Truffaut is equally superb as the doctor and so is Franoise Seigner as the doctor's housekeeper.The film is notorious for its emotional plot and JeanPierre Cargol's superb acting but also for its use of Antoni Vivaldi's classical music during numerous scenes this same music is also used in the 1979 film 'Kramer vs Kramer'.Title in Portugal 'O Menino Selvagem'.".

	schema:reviewBody "After watching L'Infant Sauvage I noticed a connection between the plot and the philosophical beliefs of Thomas Hobbes and JeanJacques Rousseau in particular their respective ideas concerning the state of nature. Hobbes believed that humans in the state of nature were solitary animalistic beings that were concerned solely on selfpreservation by any means necessary. Men were equal only in their ability to kill one another either through superior intellect or physical capabilities. In contrast Rousseau spoke of the inherent sense of compassion and the susceptibility of humans to interact socially. In the case of Victor the savage boy found in the woods of Aveyron France the theories of human development social interactions and primitive tendencies could be tested and observed. When Victor was originally found he was naked and completely unaware of modern technology and the social structures of the time. He relied on his senses alone to survive and behaved in an animalistic manner. In reference to these two philosophical theories where did Victor fall?Victor did display savage characteristics however he only seemed to be violent in the sense that he was defending himself adhering to the concept of selfpreservation. Dr. Itard tried relentlessly to develop Victor's comprehension and verbal reasoning skills. He attempted to teach Victor to read and to speak. Unfortunately at the end of the movie in my opinion it seems as though the progress Victor made was more of memorization and less of application. He memorized letters and pictures of items and was able to distinguish them from others however he was never able to perform any critical thinking exercises and never got further in the stages of speech than the ability to say the word 'milk'. As far as social skills are concerned very little compassion was seen between Victor and Dr. Itard. Victor showed emotion when he achieved certain goals and was awarded with water or milk however I do not believe those emotions were directed towards Dr. Itard as much as they were just results of reaping the benefits of performing a requested task. The end of the movie did not discuss Victor's later years but ends with Dr. Itard coming to the realization that not much more could be done to educate Victor.In the end I'm not sure if the life of Victor depicted in the film is conclusive evidence for either theories of the state of nature. Victor was not completely warlike and he didn't seem to have any compelling internal motive or a need to socialize.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film The Wild Child opens with a young boy around the age of twelve running around a forest in France acting as a savage. He seems to have had no true human interaction based on how he behaves. While in the forest a woman sees him and reports to the authorities that she saw a wild child running around. The police are able to hunt him down and capture him as if he is an animal. Due to him being in the forest the majority of his life he is not able to speak and cannot understand any type of language. They bring him to a school in Paris that is for deaf and mute children. While watching the movie one cannot help but think about Jean Jacques Rousseau's state of nature since he described how man before civil society acted as a savage. Rousseau described that while in this state man was alone and had no need for language but he only cared about his selfpreservation and he had the ability to feel compassion. This form of the state of nature seems to describe how this young boy behaved. Because before civilized man captured him he was roaming around on his own and only taking care of himself. When the wild child was brought to the school in Paris his state of nature ended and thus his civilized state began. The young boy did not make much progress at school and he was subjected to a lot of bullying. Viewers may feel sad for the wild child at this point in the film because of how he is being treated. One of the school's doctors Dr. Itard noticed the bullying and he decided to take the boy to the countryside so that he could focus on him. The doctor wanted to prove to everyone that the boy was not an idiot. Overtime the wild child starts to behave more civilized than before and Dr. Itard and the housekeeper Madame Gurin give him the name Victor. Similar to Rousseau's theory Victor is not quickly progressing from being a savage to a civilized man. He eventually begins to learn words by associating them with certain objects. He even gets to the point that he does this task quite well but his speech is still not developed. One of Victor's favorite things as a reward is milk. So Dr. Itard takes this opportunity to teach him how to say milk when he wants some. The process is not easy but Victor eventually does learn. During this time of teaching Dr. Itard is similar to the absolute sovereign in Thomas Hobbes' state of nature. He decides what Victor will do based on what he considers just. Victor continues to make strides in his development as a civilized male until the day Dr. Itard is not able to take him on his walk. By not being able to go outside Victor runs away and tries to revert back to his old savage ways. The film ends with Victor returning despite Dr. Itard and Madame Gurin thinking he would never come back. Some may argue here that he returned because he missed them or missed the comforts that he had become adapted to but if one looks at Rousseau's state of nature again one would see that he thinks man can never return to the state of nature once he leaves. And by going off this theory it makes sense that Victor could never return to his wild child ways ever again.".

	schema:reviewBody "German director Ade's 'Everyone Else' or 'All the Others'  'Alle Anderen' is very much a women's picture  in the very most positive sense.. Her story might be the kind Jane Austen would write if she lived today when a young couple must learn about each other by living together  but with the old problem of weighing themselves and their values against other people's and theirs. Ade focuses on the relationship between a young architect and his publicity agent girlfriend as they think about how to be together as a couple while spending the summer at his parents' villa on the island of Sardinia. Wonderfully natural acting by the two principals as well as action that shows off the mercurial twists in manwoman roles through daytoday events make this film continually interesting to watch even though it lacks big dramatic payoffs. But when the calibration is subtle as with Jane Austen little matters like buying a dress or deciding what to carry on a hike become matters from which much is to be learned.Gitti Birgit Minichmayr and Chris Lars Eidinger seem to have a lot of fun together. Gitti shows her eccentricity when she tells the little daughter of visiting friends to be up front if she doesn't like her. She even lets the girl pretend to shoot her then does a mock death and falls into the pool. Chris seems a little insecure about himself his talent as an architect has yet to pay off he's uncertain about a competition he's entered and Gitti is worried that he's a little wimpy. Perhaps to be more assertive he insists they spend time with his fellow architect Hans HansJochen Wagner and pregnant wife Sana Nicole Marischka whom he'd initially avoided switching gears and now considering them as potential role models. Eventually Chris acknowledges this wasn't such a good idea that he and Gitti are happier and better off being who they are. Though there's a somewhat failed hiking expedition and Chris offcamera meets with a promising local client and his future suddenly brightens up it's primarily the couple's weighing themselves against the seemingly more fortunate pair that embodies the film's life lesson.The quirky redhead Gitti given to fits of laughing has insecurities too. She doesn't like it when she asks Chris if he loves her and he answers only by kissing her. She's continually afraid he may stop loving her. Both of them in fact are in love and grateful that they ever met. This is unusual in being about a happy couple who are not headed toward tragedy or betrayal or other dramas. But the screenplay is nothing if not proof that happy isn't any more a fixed reality than confident or grownup. There isn't much more to the action than that but it's all in the details as Ade spins out one scene after another in which Eidinger and Minichmayr run through a range of emotions together.Some male viewers of this twohour film find it selfindulgent and interminable. There's little doubt that the second evening spent with Hans and Sana doesn't have to be allowed to run so long to make clear they're bores and the film could have done with some trimming. It also seems that Gitti's moodiness is allowed to go too far you begin to wonder if she may need help. However when one thinks of how natural and real the two actors are throughout it's impossible not to conclude that Ade is doing something right and has trod familiar paths but avoided clich. She just needs to develop more faith in the value of the cutting room.Seen as part of the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center 2009.".

	schema:reviewBody "Similar in style and tone to last year's Blue Valentine the German film Everyone Else provides us with an oblique look at a troubled relationship. Though the couple in this film does not seem as overtly unhappy as the one in the American work there is still something clearly eating away at their relationship. The most admirable aspect of the screenplay by Maren Ade is that it doesn't throw easy labels onto either the characters or the problems they're facing. The movie is really more a piece of objective reportage chronicling their lives over the course of a few days than a plot and themedriven narrative leading us to a preordained conclusion about them as people.Chris Lars Eidinger is a gifted but apparently not very successful architect while Gitti Birgit Minichmayr his girlfriend who works in the recording business seems to be generally supportive of his efforts. Chris and Gitti are spending a relaxing vacation at his mother's home on the Mediterranean when Gitti begins to offhandedly question Chris's masculinity we assume that it has more to do with his lack of initiative and drive than with his personal mannerisms. In response Chris begins to treat Gitti in an ever more callous fashion trying to prove her wrong by acting in the dismissive and domineering way he assumes real men do and in the way if Gitta is any indication women apparently want them to.But this synopsis really only covers the tip of the iceberg for there are clearly many more complex dynamics taking place within this relationship that are not so easily delineated and described. Suffice it to say that the movie explores the myriad elements that go into relationships and does so without spelling them out in simplistic terms and without passing judgment on the characters. The parameters within which any relationship must be set are still evolving and fluid in the case of Chris and Gitti and this leads to much pushing of the boundaries and behavioral experimentation on the part of the couple throughout the course of the film. Ade's direction is unobtrusive and observational in nature which allows the actors to interact with one another in a quasiimprovisational and thus wholly believable fashion.There is however a definite downside to this type of storytelling  Blue Valentine suffered from it as well  and that is that the motivations for the characters' actions are often so murky and inexplicable that they can seem downright arbitrary to those of us who are watching all of this unfold from the outside in. That's why Chris and Gitti strike us as being more weird and annoying  if not downright daffy  than anything else at times.Thus your initial response might be to assume that perhaps Chris and Gitti simply aren't meant for one another and that they might think about looking elsewhere for a relationship. But then again if it were that easy to get out of a troubled relationship we'd have no need in the first place for films like Everyone Else.".

	schema:reviewBody "A typical festival film with zero audience appeal 'Everyone else' could be used as a literally pictureperfect argument against statefunded film making.The rudimentary story follows a young German couple on an Italian resort island. The man is an unsuccessful architect smooching off his parents they live in their holiday home the woman a somewhat bipolar concert manager. Their relationship is questioned by the man's lackadaisical loser attitude and the woman's whimsical fretting.A story like this can only entertain or at least interest if it is a little funny. However the director Maren Ade takes very good care to avoid even the slightest trace of humor. Instead the viewer is dragged along a twohour stretch of two people boring each other to shreds  a scenario all too familiar to connoisseurs of German cinema.Still 'Everyone Else' won the Berlin Festival's Grand Jury Prize and its female lead a Silver Bear  which considering her lobotomous approach to acting is quite remarkable. This proves in my view once more the flimsiness of festival selections and the way awards are given away a movie with such obvious dismay for any imaginable audience must surely be artistic and therefore prizeworthy  for culture politicians. Not for cineasts and the general public that's for sure.A much better German approach to the same topic would be the equally dry but much more entertaining 'Windows on Monday' aka Montags kommen die Fenster 2006. That film has a weird sense of humor to it which makes the drab coupleconflict plot work quite well.".

However the director Maren Ade takes very good care to avoid even the slightest trace of humor. Instead the viewer is dragged along a twohour stretch of two people boring each other to shreds  a scenario all too familiar to connoisseurs of German cinema.Still 'Everyone Else' won the Berlin Festival's Grand Jury Prize and its female lead a Silver Bear  which considering her lobotomous approach to acting is quite remarkable. This proves in my view once more the flimsiness of festival selections and the way awards are given away a movie with such obvious dismay for any imaginable audience must surely be artistic and therefore prizeworthy  for culture politicians. Not for cineasts and the general public that's for sure.A much better German approach to the same topic would be the equally dry but much more entertaining 'Windows on Monday' aka Montags kommen die Fenster 2006. That film has a weird sense of humor to it which makes the drab coupleconflict plot work quite well.";

This is probably one of the slowest movies I've ever seen. Long silences punctuate boring longwinding conversations that seem to go on forever. After a while the theme begins to repeat itself. Quarrels over trivial things between a very introvert guy and a girl who apparently enjoys throwing the odd tantrum. This basically goes on for 2 hours. As already pointed out in another comment at the end of the movie you start to wonder if the girl has some serious mental issues. The acting is not bad but I wouldn't call it special. At the end of the movie you're left confused not really understanding what the point of the story was. The ending is abrupt and if one would actually be interested in the story at all it would leave one with an unsatisfactory finale. Why this movie won the Silver Bear in Berlin is a mystery to me.

In the end do we really care enough about these characters to really care if things work out between the two? I say no.The movie is well acted and for what it attempts to do I think it's well made to a certain extent. I just don't admire what it attempts to do very much. It wants us to see what an average couple goes through in good times and bad and see what drives them apart and what keeps them together. I think they portrayed a believable average couple realistically it's just not the type of couple I'd care to spend much time with. That's what the movie is like spending a lot of time with an annoying bickering couple. For me that's hard to watch and pointless. I can go hang out with some of my friends if I want to see that. Other than living the painful realities of a painful relationship the movie has nothing else of any value to offer. There's nothing learned here and certainly nothing witnessed of any entertainment value. The movie just doesn't work.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vm3RUjISnYI".

They play a couple that is clearly struggling with the lack of masculinity in their relationship especially when they keep meeting another couple with a clearly different approach to the subject. What can I say? I personally thought this was not a good watch. None of the 4 major characters in the film were likable to me and that resulted in me not caring for them at all. People may say their flaws define their actions and make them interesting but I personally did not feel they were written in a realistic manner. It all felt so over the top especially the scenes that the two had together. They were written in a way that lacked authenticity completely and allowed the actors to go as hammy as possible.The only somewhat interesting scenes in my opinion were when the two met the other couple on 3 occasions because of the group mentality that was fascinating to watch on several occasions. Then again it was really always the same basically. People acting as if they like each other when all they felt for the other was really despair and yet Minichmayr's character even if she despised the strong alpha male did not like the weakling that her boyfriend was. Did not make any sense at all. Her character was clearly written in a way that should have been as baity as possibly but in depth did not make any sense. Eidinger's character's approach to acting like a feminine sissy or trying to be masculine and failing gloriously was neither a good portrayal nor intelligently written. All in all the film lacked subtlety and good character writing from start to finish and the ending with the apparent splitup followed by the two acting in harmony again was extremely lackluster too. The worst possible way that this could have ended. By then not only the audience does not care about the two anymore but even Ade herself apparently wasn't giving a beep anymore. The material does not justify such a massive runtime. 4 stars out of 10 is a very generous rating here. Do not be fooled by all the awards attention this movie got. It is not worth seeing. Not at all.".

Chris an architect and Gitti who handles pop musical groups are staying at his parent's villa high above the town and the beaches. They are left alone when some other guests depart. Chris and Gitti are in a relationship that for all signs we get are new at living together.As they explore their sexuality one gets the impression not everything is what it should be. Perhaps with time they will achieve some degree of togetherness. Chris has been in touch with someone in the island that wants to use his skills to remodel a home. Gitti finds herself alone most of the time as Chris meets his prospective client.Spotting a couple Chris knows one day at a supermarket changes their lonely existence. Hans is also an architect and his companion Sana is a fashion designer. Chris is reluctant to mingle with them but he cannot avoid them. Meeting for dinner does not end in a happy note as Hans clearly drunk throws Sana into the pool. Chris does the same thing to Gitti who did not appreciate the gesture.With time in her hands Gitti examines her relationship. Not everything is the way she hoped it would be. Even the times when they are having sex does not make her feel any different. When she decides she has to go back Chris realizes he has to do something. Finding her on the floor unresponsive scares him because he really has come around to realize he really cares for her.Maren Ade's Everyone Else is a character study between two people that should be in love but as we get to know Gitti and Chris better we realize not everything is there. While Gitti is spontaneous and fun Chris is reserved perhaps not as open as she is. Ms. Ade follows the pair as they go through different changes before they realize the how deep is their commitment. What the film cries for is perhaps some editing. A tighter film perhaps would have made the film more accessible to audiences. It is obvious this film was not intended for a large audience and viewers without an idea about what it is about will be bored to death because there is no action to speak of. Ms. Ade takes a look at this complex couple and she is serious about what she wanted to tell.Birgit Minichmayr and Lars Eidinger make an impact as the couple being studied in the film. Ms. Minichmayr fares best as Gitti she is a natural and she has a way to convey what she is feeling any moment she is in front of the camera. Mr. Eidinger is also good but it takes a while to warm to him.The film is devoid of music. The only exception comes in the way of a stereo being turned on by one the characters. Bernard Keller photographs the intimate setting of the villa as well as some rough mountainous area of Sardinia.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a violent brutal to some confusing but fascinating and ultimately a brilliant allegorical film. It was the first of the midnight cult films.Unrelenting at times.  There are several characters and situations the protagonist experiences. Each of these characters and situations have a connection to various mostly Eastern religions.  The feel of the first part is almost like a midperiod Fellini spaghetti western had Fellini made a spaghetti westernwhich he did not.  The second half of the film has an entirely different feel message and pacing.  The second half of the film is an allegory of the New Testament.  Eventually it does all tie together however.There seems to be a scene missing at about the midpoint of the film and a characters motivation suddenly changes.   Jodorowsky explained it was mostly intentional but two shots were ruined and never reshot which would have helped set up a more discernible meaning to the scene in question.  It occurs between the women in the desert.Jodorowsky will not explain in detail all that he was going for in the film.  He considers the film an Eastern.... he agrees that my interpretation of various characters embodying Eastern religion and philosophy is correct.   He also was creating a film of emotions violence salvation and redemptionso he intentionally did not follow the expected structure of most films regarding first second and third acts and when major conflicts occur.He flippantly agreed with some New York critics years ago who described the film as one which seemed to be a filmed version of a very strange L.S.D. trip.  He had a lengthy conversation which was published and used as liner notes in the El TOPO soundtrack album which talked about the film in terms of it being something akin to a LSD trip.   But Jodorowsky said you certainly don't need LSD to enjoy it it's already been done for you.This was not something he was serious about it.  But being 1969  and after having trouble getting a distributor for the film in the first place and now watching the film having moderate success as a midnight cult film and amongst college students he decided it was good for the film to agree that the N.Y. critics were partially correct.It is at times an extremely disturbing film. I thought I detected more than a little of misogyny in the film however as Jodorowsky essentially told menone has been intended except that the world now like in the past has always brutalized women and men have insisted on brutalizing themselves.Seeing it with an audience in a theater also means you can discuss it with people of all types.  Reactions to the film are all over the map.  Most agree it is art many don't like the filmmany find it too disturbing too violent too sacrilegious too scattered. Others disagree over the various messages and meanings they receive from the film. Others just 'enjoy' it as a wild weird disturbing film.Usually video copies of the film are from Japanese laserdiscs which fog all pubic hair.  It looks strange if you are not familiar with this.It is a film akin to an Opera.  Although it was extremely lowbudget the film is an epic and has if not a big budget feel to it  an impressive grandeur and sweep that few films achieve.Filmed over a course of nearly three years the filmmakers twice were stranded for weeks without supplies and without money.  This film was started in 196465 completed and originally set for release in 196768 it predates The Wild Bunch Easy Rider and other 60's landmarks....     It was a true labor of love to finish the film.  And then the film was banned in several countries.It is not in general release.  For many years from the late 70's to the mid 90's it was rarely if ever shown.A few years ago I revisited the film in a theatre and had the opportunity to discuss it as an audience member and later on one with Jodorowsky.   His other film Sante Sangre is also quite good in my opinion but I am not a fan of his Holy Mountain. Other films he has been involved with are of lesser value. He was a good friend of Fellini's and may someday direct Fellini's script of Don Quixote.  He is working on Son of El Topo but not sure when it will be released and who will distribute it.El Topo began a nearly 5 year run as a midnight film and often sold out. It started in a small Greenwich Village theatre in New York City. After a few years of success in NYC other prints were distributed to college campuses and for midnight shows in other cities.  It became a modest hit!".

This film was started in 196465 completed and originally set for release in 196768 it predates The Wild Bunch Easy Rider and other 60's landmarks....     It was a true labor of love to finish the film.  And then the film was banned in several countries.It is not in general release.  For many years from the late 70's to the mid 90's it was rarely if ever shown.A few years ago I revisited the film in a theatre and had the opportunity to discuss it as an audience member and later on one with Jodorowsky.   His other film Sante Sangre is also quite good in my opinion but I am not a fan of his Holy Mountain. Other films he has been involved with are of lesser value. He was a good friend of Fellini's and may someday direct Fellini's script of Don Quixote.  He is working on Son of El Topo but not sure when it will be released and who will distribute it.El Topo began a nearly 5 year run as a midnight film and often sold out. It started in a small Greenwich Village theatre in New York City. After a few years of success in NYC other prints were distributed to college campuses and for midnight shows in other cities.  It became a modest hit!";

	schema:reviewBody "So far I had only seen Jodorowsky's Santa Sangre but that one happens to be my alltime favorite film! One thing's for sure with this director whenever you check out one of his films for the first time you should expect the unexpected and prepare yourself for not believing what your own eyes are observing most of the time. Just in case you really have to label El Topo with a genre it would presumably be Western but that still doesn't give you any idea of the film's content whatsoever. Within the first ten minutes alone things occur that are already too weird to mention like grown men shooting at women's shoes and bandits dancing and caressing monks!! and these sequences aren't relevant to the actual plot yet! Well I'd love to summarize the main story lines but the truth is that I didn't understand one iota of it all. The pivot character El Topo portrayed by the director himself rides through the desert with a 7yearold naked kid in tow. He exchanges the kid for a beautiful woman after defeating a gang of thugs and goes on a quest to visit four masters of the desert. Subsequently he joins a community of mountain people and fervently helps them coming out of their dark habitat and into the open world. Yes it's a very vague description but that's because I didn't know what was going on anyway. Most likely you won't either and that's not an insult to your personal intellect! It's just a messed up movie that you mainly just need to watch for its visual brilliance symbolism and extremely stylish choreography. Every single character that walks through the screen is a demented  complex individual and the protagonist is the absolute biggest weirdo of them all. He actually claims to be God himself  and really believes it too  and does the most unpredictable things imaginable. Admittedly this film isn't suitable for entertainment purposes. It's an intense and demanding experience that you should approach with an open state of mind and loads of patience. Purely elite cinema that can't be compared to anything else ever made.".

	schema:headline " A religious allegorical western of redemption with surrealist imagery.";
	schema:reviewBody "El Topo is probably Jodorowsky's most talked about film next to Santa Sangre. Like all his films it is bizarre and full of symbolism. El Topo is a cowboy dressed in black. He is out for vengeance kind of like the Biblical God of the old testament. Him and his son ride through a town of massacred civilians. He wants justice and to win the heart of a girl Mara. He gives up his only son in an act that could be looked at like God or even Abraham. He has to kill seven master gunfighters. After all the violence and carnage he is injured and taken under the care of cripples dwarfs and other various misfits. He is reborn almost like a Bhuddist monk. He becomes like the new testament God Jesus Christ. El Topo is now like a savior to the oppressed. He vows to dig a tunnel out of the cave so the cripples can live among the villagers. The town is taken over by religious fanatics. Poor villagers are branded with the religious icon by force. An upper class of elitists now dominate the town. El Topo is beautiful and chocked full of violent and disturbing imagery. The film became a popular cult sensation in the early 70's. It was embraced by the likes of John Lennon Dennis Hopper Jack Nicholson Peter Gabriel and Pink Floyd. More recently celebrities like Marilyn Manson and the Coen Brothers have talked about being strongly influenced by Jodorowsky's work. El Topo is important because it was the first midnight movie. If people could forget about the Rocky Horror Picture Show just for a second they'd realize that this is one of the most important cult films. A bizarre and surreal western that can never be imitated. The only 3 surreal westerns I can think of to predate El Topo that have many similarities are Brazilian director Glauber Rocha's Black God White Devil 1964 and his follow up Antonio Das Mortes 1969 and the Italian Spaghetti western Django Kill if you Live Shoot 1967.".

While I never joined a cult I was moved to see it a many times as I did because it was a metaphor that spoke strongly to my own spiritual searches at the time. The western motif and travels of our heroanti hero spoke eloquently of the mole's search for the light. While the violence was overwhelming at times I didn't think is redundant or too much. Western society perhaps all great civilizations was built on a tremendous amount of violence. The scenes in the mountain with those marginalized from society and their subsequent liberation out of the mountain and into the light was an awesome scene. The violence that took place after wards and our own here's self immolation was very poignant. I continue to look for the movie today and hope that whatever is preventing it from being available in North America will be resolved soon. I am very curious to observe my own responses to this film today. I have seen other movies by Jordorowsky and none equaled the impact that El Topo had upon me.".

This midnite movie cult classic is one of those films I had been told was a must see though I knew it was not that easy. Most viewers either love or hate the movie with no in between. Jodorowsky delivered as writerdirectoractorcomposer a mixed bag of metaphor allegory imagery spaghetti western fantasy horror and utter gore weighed down with Buddhism and Christianity and just about anything else from the philosophical and metaphysical kitchen sink. The aforementioned is fine but when the final destination for the audience is nowhere I can understand the passionate hatred from those who despise the film.

Do they represent the Four Horsemen the Four Winds the Four Elements? It is anybody's guess. The movie is so loaded with imagery upon imagery it is as if Jodorowsky was purposefully stirring the pot just to keep people guessing. Maybe as lovers of the film try to decipher the layers of meaning Jodorowsky is laughing somewhere. This film did not satisfy me on any level because the result was a pile of primordial ooze that did not have time to gel into something coherent. Granted I was intrigued by Topo's Zenlike transformation especially when he worked so diligently to save the deformed cripples but this was not enough to justify what came beforehand.The movie is a circus sideshow with bits and pieces that are at times amusing while disgusting on other occasions. In this vein Jodorowsky delivered the grotesque on a tortilla. At times both ridiculous and frightening he shocks the audience with a stream of phantasmagorical scenes that lead only to the end credits and nothing more. Whatever Jodorowsky was searching for it was for him and him alone. The movie was self indulgent and left me amazingly disappointed.I can sit and discuss Lynch's disturbing Eraserhead Miike's overthetop Visitor Q and Gilliam's Orwellian Brasil but Jodorowsky's work leads to a dead end because it is utterly nonsensical.".

	schema:headline " A major disappointment...";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS   SPOILERS I was perusing the Foreign section of the local video store of rare and hard to find films when I saw El Topo sitting plainly on the shelf.  My heart rose as I had heard much about the film and wanted to see it very much  plus it is so hard to find and JESUS CHRIST it was sitting right there!I took it home and watched it right away.  I was extremely disappointed. Folks there is a reason why this movie is so hard to find let me tell you...SPOILERSThe first half of this movie has the main character El Topo with his young son riding through the desert where they encounter various violent wierdnesses.  The first is a barn in the middle of nowhere with mutilated human and cattle all over the place.  Only one man is left  he is lying on the ground wounded and begging for El Topo to put him out of his misery. El Topo gives his gun to the sevenyearold boy who kills the man.  Nice right?  This is just one of the many pointless situations they get themselves into.  After this they arrive somewhere else and then somewhere else again and again just for more unexplained violence without any other plot explanation or transition between these episodes.The second half begins after El Topo is shot dead.  We are taken to yet another remote village in the desert again without any explanation or reason whatsoever.  A few scenes stand out in my head1. A man is slaving over a group of women in some sort of salon.  They all seem to be hitting on him wanting him to fool around with them. Eventually one of the women drops something and when he bends over to pick it up for her she pulls him to her inner thigh and then starts screaming out that he is advancing on her without her consent.  The other women rush over and start hitting him then sexually abusing HIM all the while shouting at him to stop raping them.  He is dragged outside by the town's men where he is hung and shot.2. In some sort of room a bunch of townspeople are passing around a gun loaded with one blank bullit which they pretend is real and pretend to play Russian roulette.  Everyone misses the blank bullit and shouting out that they are holy for being so lucky.  The son of El Topo who has found his way to this village and now grown into a man takes the gun removes the blank and replaces it with a real bullit.  He then does a round of roulette on himself and survives.  The people love it.  They pass around the gun pulling the trigger on themselves surviving.  Each time they shout out praises to God and what not.  In all the excitement a young child grabs the gun and shoots himself in the head and dies.If these scenes are supposed to mean something I sure as hell missed the point.END OF SPOILERSIt's not that I don't like Jodorowsky's work or am weakstomached.  I adore SANTA SANGRE and would recommend it to anyone.  It's just that the film seems to exploit unpleasantness as if it were a valuable asset in a film. It does so without entertainment shockvalue or any other form of success and just comes off as a waste of the little time and money it might have cost to make it.  It is offensive for that reason  offensively bad.Anyone who is on this website must appreciate good films.  I know I do. There is so much else to apply your mind to ladies and gentlemen.  Go out and rent something worth your while.  Don't rent this crap just because it's rare and notorious.  That's why I rented it but that's not why I didn't like it.  Even for those who pursue hardtofind videos like me beware. This is pretty lousy filmmaking.".

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS   SPOILERS I was perusing the Foreign section of the local video store of rare and hard to find films when I saw El Topo sitting plainly on the shelf.  My heart rose as I had heard much about the film and wanted to see it very much  plus it is so hard to find and JESUS CHRIST it was sitting right there!I took it home and watched it right away.  I was extremely disappointed. Folks there is a reason why this movie is so hard to find let me tell you...SPOILERSThe first half of this movie has the main character El Topo with his young son riding through the desert where they encounter various violent wierdnesses.  The first is a barn in the middle of nowhere with mutilated human and cattle all over the place.  Only one man is left  he is lying on the ground wounded and begging for El Topo to put him out of his misery. El Topo gives his gun to the sevenyearold boy who kills the man.  Nice right?  This is just one of the many pointless situations they get themselves into.  After this they arrive somewhere else and then somewhere else again and again just for more unexplained violence without any other plot explanation or transition between these episodes.The second half begins after El Topo is shot dead.  We are taken to yet another remote village in the desert again without any explanation or reason whatsoever.  A few scenes stand out in my head1.

Well I'm here to say that this is a vastly overrated student art film.The symbolism is overdone and sophomoric at best. In fact it is as if the director thought symbolism could be substituted for plot and character development forgetting that these are tools used to enhance them. Also the overly hackneyed and simplistic symbolism takes away from the surreal experience that the director intended to create. It was akin to viewing the subconscious of a mental midget weird but boring as all hell!! I'm not even going to dwindle on the violence. It goes without saying that over time it has lost its shock value. However it was not necessarily gratuitousalthough the symbolism wasand did add to the story.Overall if you like freaky stuff for the sake of freakishness this film is up your alley. But if you want more substance and meaningful development avoid El Topo at all possible cost. I know I want those two hours of my life back!".

By the end I couldn't help but feel it's another case of the emperor's new clothes in terms of style over substance and the sum of the whole ending up much less than the individual parts.The story starts out straightforward enough with a distinctive gunslinger discovering the aftermath of a massacre and vowing to take revenge on the outlaws responsible. Once that story is out of the way though it starts getting weirder and weirder almost existentialist as the gunslinger has encounters with a series of deitylike characters in the desert and undergoes a religiously significant transformation. By the end I was quite frankly bored.Here's the good stuff Jodorowsky's cinematography which is glorious. EL TOPO is vibrantlooking and colourful throughout and I love the use of surreal imagery which really works. There are poignant scenes and flashes of Peckinpahstyle ultraviolence and the contrasting elements are mixed together well. It's just the script really which lets it down becoming too abstract I always prefer a more concrete narrative as a basis on which to pin the more fantastic elements but EL TOPO is lacking such a construct and at times just seems to be being made up as it goes along.".

Lust love rape compassion murder euthanasia sacrifice liberation enslavement faith death and procreation  few stones are left unturned in this desert.A highly skilled gunfighter who calls himself God travels through the desert with his son and visits the scene of massacre. Seeking righteous vengeance he tracks down the perpetrators and having exacted revenge abandons his son with a group of Franciscans and adopts the agenda of a woman he has freed from bondage because of his desire for her. This very generally covers the first quarter of the film and the themes that are implied are reexamined several times throughout the film.El Topo the mole played by Joudorowsky seeks the light but as we learn in the opening sequence the light will instantly blind him. His desires and the actions they inspire progress from primitive detached selfindulgence to redemptive selfsacrifice. He does wonderful things and loathsome things and the consequences of his actions are never as he intended. Thematically the story hints at the connection between Taoist concepts of acting through inaction and mystical aspects of some western religions  simultaneously suggesting that only God can know the mind of God and that if no god exists humans must acknowledge their dependence on the forces that govern the universe and seek harmony by yielding to them.Like most westerns there is a great deal of killing and gun play in El Topo and the death scenes are often grueling and overdramatized. Unlike most westerns however none of this violence is pointless and it is not the central action of the story.Jodorowski is a deeply spiritual filmmaker but is also intensely critical of organized religion and the demystification of religious ideas. He seemingly has little faith in the human ability to conceptualize cosmic forces. Notably Jodorowsky never makes any statement whatsoever about science.The metanarrative of El Topo can be read in many ways and is the level at which the film achieves high art. Does the transparent allegory of El Topo's life suggest that the JudaeoChristian god is himself blinded by the light and consumed by fires he himself starts? Does the more or less consistent inaction of His son indicate a way out of the catch22 of causes and effects his actions have set in motion or does his son's determination to take on the responsibilities and relationships of his father convert the son into a new embodiment of the mole? Or is it human ignorance willfulness and wickedness which are responsible for all of miseries of human existence? Each thoughtful viewer will take away a different message.Gender is a major theme in El Topo and although the main story is clearly presented from an androcentric perspective Jodorowski adds a lot of details which effectively deconstruct this and in some cases unmask it as an arbitrary convention of patriarchal religious doctrine. When you watch the film pay particular attention to the voices and bodies of the different characters. I am convinced that these details are not simply added to jar and disorient. Finally a comparison of the two main female characters  the loves of El Topo's life  is very important in 'getting' this film. One represents true love and true beauty and the other illustrates something else. And it is significant that it is El Topo and El Topo alone in his quest for the true path who brings to his relationships a spiritual aspect. Considered without his selfproclaimed godhood there does not appear to be anything supernatural about these women or his relationship with them. Perhaps there is also a comment on agnosticism somewhere in all of this.Well acted especially Jodorowski beautifully shot and excellently scripted El Topo is a great film by a great though eccentric film maker.As a nonreligious Taoist and scientist I found it easy to contextualize Jodorowski's story and the messages it appears to carry. I do not however pretend that my interpretation is correct. To do so would be an act of violence against the film's art.If you're up for a brutal film which can not be enjoyed without a great of concentrated thought I recommend it.".

Does the transparent allegory of El Topo's life suggest that the JudaeoChristian god is himself blinded by the light and consumed by fires he himself starts? Does the more or less consistent inaction of His son indicate a way out of the catch22 of causes and effects his actions have set in motion or does his son's determination to take on the responsibilities and relationships of his father convert the son into a new embodiment of the mole? Or is it human ignorance willfulness and wickedness which are responsible for all of miseries of human existence? Each thoughtful viewer will take away a different message.Gender is a major theme in El Topo and although the main story is clearly presented from an androcentric perspective Jodorowski adds a lot of details which effectively deconstruct this and in some cases unmask it as an arbitrary convention of patriarchal religious doctrine. When you watch the film pay particular attention to the voices and bodies of the different characters. I am convinced that these details are not simply added to jar and disorient. Finally a comparison of the two main female characters  the loves of El Topo's life  is very important in 'getting' this film. One represents true love and true beauty and the other illustrates something else. And it is significant that it is El Topo and El Topo alone in his quest for the true path who brings to his relationships a spiritual aspect. Considered without his selfproclaimed godhood there does not appear to be anything supernatural about these women or his relationship with them. Perhaps there is also a comment on agnosticism somewhere in all of this.Well acted especially Jodorowski beautifully shot and excellently scripted El Topo is a great film by a great though eccentric film maker.As a nonreligious Taoist and scientist I found it easy to contextualize Jodorowski's story and the messages it appears to carry. I do not however pretend that my interpretation is correct. To do so would be an act of violence against the film's art.If you're up for a brutal film which can not be enjoyed without a great of concentrated thought I recommend it.";

	schema:reviewBody " out of This film EL TOPO is a flawless exciting and emotionally draining experience. Absolutely amazing. it is such a privilege to finally view this fantastic film. This is the kind of film that really makes you smile at some of the wonderful things about film and the power of film and what it can represent. I am so happy that more people have the opportunity to finally watch it.I cannot describe the plot as any description of it no matter how vague or subtle will not keep it from sounding ridiculous or silly. This film is a lot of things. It is not quite a western nor is it quite an action film. It isn't quite a romance nor is it straight out drama. It isn't quite a musical nor is it quite a horror film. It isn't quite a biography nor is it quite a prison or crime film. It isn't quite pornography but it isn't quite a splatter film. It is not quite a religious film as it contains all religions. it has some many details from all of these genres littered throughout. It is hard to put a label on this film because it is so outside the realm of being labeled as anything. I feel that this film belongs in a specific group that only consists of this film the follow up entitled THE HOLY MOUNTAIN and the one before it entitled FANDO Y LIS.I feel that this film represents more than just a simple form of art or a simple form of expressionism. This film represents a kind of specific audience point of view of people who want to be pleased by a type of film that is weird in a comfortable way. The film has so many satisfying details from the set design to the way the story spanning more than 10 or 20 years the natural way events play out the extreme violence and gore the fine madness of the characters surrounding the main one and the human interactions and how the characters differences in their bodies or the way they think don't get in the way.The film is very humorous too. There are several parts that i did find very darkly funny. I don't want to ruin anything but there is a very predictable part involving a gun and the people not taking the weapon seriously enough to allow any person to try it out on themselves. It's quite dark and pretty sinister but i laughed at it's extremity because you just don't get that kind of effect from the usual film.When i say the film is flawless i don't mean technically i mean flawless in representing the filmmaker Alexandre Jodrowsky's intentions of the film and it's representation of himself or his life. Since the film is meant to partly be autobiographical it allows him to use himself in all of his personal designs and representations of how he thinks and what he wants to present on the screen. I feel since he used his own son as a key character his character is a priest in the second half of the film and used his voice to dub in a large portion of the characters to place them in easier context to himself he is able to further demonstrate his own vision even further. This is a man who didn't have a happy childhood with his father trying to force him not to have children to not carry on the family name and eventually being gay it's an interesting choice to have the main character kill off a manifestation of his father early in the film.Many people that i know probably know who director Alexandre Jodrowsky is especially if they are Marilyn Manson fans since that dude practically worships him. But if you are interested in midnight films or cult film this film practically invented them so I highly recommend this wonderful and brilliant film.Contains extreme violence and gore and strong sexual content".

The director has also depicted a very serious and fascinating study on how Londoners were unprepared to react to such an emergency. Overall this is a poignant and insightfilled take on prejudice in post117 London well acted and directed.

	schema:reviewBody "Weeks after the terrorist attacks in London a mother calls her daughter over and over again. She hasn't heard from her in a while and is getting more and more anxious about her knowing she lived close to where the events took place. When she goes to London to find her she finds a man instead. A man who matches her in one important manner  he is searching for his son. The two of them continue their search together and slowly find out more about themselves and each other.Dark and dreary depressing and painful.

The film follows their efforts to find out what happened to them and their struggle to accept the obvious.The brilliance about London River is that what could have been an over melodramatic film is instead very emotionally repressed.I know that for Brazilians and other LatinAmerican people telling such a dramatic story this way might seem odd and even worse cold. But it truly isn't. It turns out quite the opposite in fact.The very contained direction and script from Rachid Bouchareb ends up making you feel even more for these parents and what they are going through. Their despair is subtle and yet palpable. It involves you and moves you. It is heartbreaking.Another reason for being the perfect way to tell this story is that the fear and prejudice that permeates British society is a touchy issue. How could it not be? No one likes to admit their faults but facing it this way without accusations or making it a spectacle like Michael Moore in Bowling for Columbine or Fahrenheit 911 is more powerful it makes you think. It is also a very respectful and honorable way of tackling a very real and present aspect of British life.If the technical aspects of London River weren't enough to make it a great film then you can delight and be amazed with Brenda Blethyn and Sotigui Kouyat performances. They are very honest and beautiful. They will bring tears to your eyes I guarantee.On a personal note I rarely watch a film and am taken aback by the actors to the point that I think they deserve awards but this time I did. I really hope they get nominated for the major awards. It will be shocking and unfair if they don't.".

The multilingual aspect was wonderful and it is possibly more fun to watch it without subtitles so that just like in real life you cannot understand what is being said in languages that you don't speak. Both Brenda Blethyn and Sotigui Kouyat were excellent with their understated portrayals of parents from very different backgrounds who meet on common ground.

	schema:reviewBody "What does an African Muslim refugee living in France share with a white Christian widow from Great Britain?  The longing search of their missing children after the London bombings in 2005. With gentle and aesthetic camera movements and slow action progress Rachid Bouchareb portrays two distinct cultures  but as the movie goes on they turn out not to be that different after all. Ousmane Sotigui Kouyat left his six year old son Ali with his wife in Africa to work as a woodsman In France. When he  many years later  gets a call from he's worried wife in Africa telling him that she hasn't heard from their son  now living in London  since the bombings Ousmane travels to London right away to look for him. While the mystic Ousmane wanders around the desert streets of London for hints and clues about his unknown son he comes across the widowed mother Elisabeth Brenda Blethyn several times  who's more or less doing the same thing concerning her daughter. It sooner turns out that their children knowknew each other and together they search for answers. London River 2009 is both a thrilling drama and a balanced picture of the suffering families in the shadow of the London terrorattacks. It's the movie that Hollywood unfortunately never got after 911.".

With gentle and aesthetic camera movements and slow action progress Rachid Bouchareb portrays two distinct cultures  but as the movie goes on they turn out not to be that different after all. Ousmane Sotigui Kouyat left his six year old son Ali with his wife in Africa to work as a woodsman In France. When he  many years later  gets a call from he's worried wife in Africa telling him that she hasn't heard from their son  now living in London  since the bombings Ousmane travels to London right away to look for him. While the mystic Ousmane wanders around the desert streets of London for hints and clues about his unknown son he comes across the widowed mother Elisabeth Brenda Blethyn several times  who's more or less doing the same thing concerning her daughter. It sooner turns out that their children knowknew each other and together they search for answers. London River 2009 is both a thrilling drama and a balanced picture of the suffering families in the shadow of the London terrorattacks. It's the movie that Hollywood unfortunately never got after 911.";

I have not seen any of the previous films of Rachid Bouchareb but I heard a lot about 'Indigenes' and I liked 'Flanders' that he produced. This film is quite low tone but emotional and direct. In the aftermath of the terror attacks in London two parents look for their children. She is an English farmer widower from a remote island he is from Africa a Muslim and guest worker in France. Everything separates the two at first sight  religion language race and especially prejudice. They will get together because of the shared fate of their children and they will go together through the painful phases of inquietude fear hope and despair. They get to know each other but this does not prevent destiny to hit them. I liked the fact that the film does not try to soften in anyway their paths and avoided some of the traps that other types of endings or intrigues place in similar movies. Multicultural London filmed in a neutral and yet familiar way is the perfect background of the story that includes some racial tensions elements without insisting too much on them. Without avoiding completely simplification and a feeling of expected this direct approach plays quite well and is immensely helped by the great acting of the two lead characters especially Sotigui Kouyat. This is not the ultimate film about the events that shattered London in July 2005 but rather a simple story about how usual people get are impacted by such events an efficient and direct movie even if not great cinema.".

I'm being generous not damning this film because the two principal actors give good enough portrayals of the characters despite the poor standard of writing in the script. One of them was constantly reminding me of Giacommetti sculptures  a distraction from the criminal bloopers that had not been cut e.g. a post September 2007 car registration number clearly visible centre screen for several long seconds. There is no story arc worth mentioning. You know how it's going to end and quite frankly it's hard to care other than feeling moved by the loss of life.

I can only say that my cinema going experience would have been that much the poorer had I not made this decision such is the power sincerity and integrity of this highly charged work. Although the horrendous events of 77 are an integral part of the film it touches on so much more in its presentation of two disparate characters drawn together in a common quest she a farming widow living on Guernsey he an African forestry worker from France.

Her unease and expressions of bigotry only intensify the more she comes to realise that her daughter may have been cohabiting with a Muslim.

	schema:headline " John Ford's First Epic Look At American West";
	schema:reviewBody "A young boy grows to fulfill his murdered father's vision of seeing THE IRON HORSE the mighty transcontinental railway stitch the country together binding East to West.Bursting with excitement  patriotic fervor THE IRON HORSE is the film which put young director John Ford on the cinematic map. He brought together all he had learned from years of making shorter smaller films and he produced a product which heralded his enormous contributions to sound films in the years to come. This is a director's picture' in that the stars as good as they are are almost negligible what was important here was Ford's vision  his ability to place it before the audience. Indeed he does not even bring his leading man George O'Brien on screen until 45 minutes into the story  a shortcut to disaster almost anywhere else.In all fairness it should be noted that O'Brien handsome  stronglimbed does very well as the gentle hero. He would find similar roles in other epic films of the decade. J. Farrell MacDonald as Irish Corporal Casey is the prototype for many comically eccentric fellows who would appear in other Ford westerns.The film often takes on the aspects of an ancient newsreel. Cattle drives Indian attacks  endless track laying all look utterly real. Particularly fascinating is the depiction of the dismantlement of the endofthetrack town so that not even a dog is left as it is moved many miles further on to the west. This type of arcane information is what makes watching very old films so enjoyable.THE IRON HORSE represented the largest migration out of Hollywood for location shooting up to that time. Nothing like this had been attempted before so Ford  his lieutenants were forced to make up the rules as they went along.Hiring a circus train the small army of extras arrived at the subzero Nevada location in January of 1924. The conditions which greeted them were authentically primitive. It was so cold the extras quickly began sleeping in their costumes. Finding the train to be flea ridden they moved into the sets and began living exactly as the characters they were portraying. The female extras especially suffered from the rugged conditions. A frontier mindset seemed to take over many of the cast  crew the circus tent which doubled as both the movie saloon and the crew's commissary eventually had to have the catsup bottles removed from the tables to discourage the many fights which kept breaking out.Authenticity found its way into the movie in other more positive ways. Several of the elderly Chinese extras representing laborers on the Central Pacific had actually worked on the real McCoy sixty years previous. They came out of retirement to appear in the film  enjoyed themselves immensely. Ford also managed to locate the two original locomotives which met at Promontory Point Utah in 1869 and reunited them for the film's climax.Composer John Lanchbery has contributed a splendid soundtrack to the restored video version incorporating several contemporaneous tunes of the period. It would be intriguing to double bill THE IRON HORSE with Cecil B. DeMille's UNION PACIFIC 1939 which tells the same historical story but with a completely different tack  set of fictional characters.".

	onyx:emotionText "A young boy grows to fulfill his murdered father's vision of seeing THE IRON HORSE the mighty transcontinental railway stitch the country together binding East to West.Bursting with excitement  patriotic fervor THE IRON HORSE is the film which put young director John Ford on the cinematic map. He brought together all he had learned from years of making shorter smaller films and he produced a product which heralded his enormous contributions to sound films in the years to come. This is a director's picture' in that the stars as good as they are are almost negligible what was important here was Ford's vision  his ability to place it before the audience. Indeed he does not even bring his leading man George O'Brien on screen until 45 minutes into the story  a shortcut to disaster almost anywhere else.In all fairness it should be noted that O'Brien handsome  stronglimbed does very well as the gentle hero. He would find similar roles in other epic films of the decade. J. Farrell MacDonald as Irish Corporal Casey is the prototype for many comically eccentric fellows who would appear in other Ford westerns.The film often takes on the aspects of an ancient newsreel. Cattle drives Indian attacks  endless track laying all look utterly real. Particularly fascinating is the depiction of the dismantlement of the endofthetrack town so that not even a dog is left as it is moved many miles further on to the west. This type of arcane information is what makes watching very old films so enjoyable.THE IRON HORSE represented the largest migration out of Hollywood for location shooting up to that time. Nothing like this had been attempted before so Ford  his lieutenants were forced to make up the rules as they went along.Hiring a circus train the small army of extras arrived at the subzero Nevada location in January of 1924. The conditions which greeted them were authentically primitive. It was so cold the extras quickly began sleeping in their costumes. Finding the train to be flea ridden they moved into the sets and began living exactly as the characters they were portraying. The female extras especially suffered from the rugged conditions. A frontier mindset seemed to take over many of the cast  crew the circus tent which doubled as both the movie saloon and the crew's commissary eventually had to have the catsup bottles removed from the tables to discourage the many fights which kept breaking out.Authenticity found its way into the movie in other more positive ways. Several of the elderly Chinese extras representing laborers on the Central Pacific had actually worked on the real McCoy sixty years previous. They came out of retirement to appear in the film  enjoyed themselves immensely. Ford also managed to locate the two original locomotives which met at Promontory Point Utah in 1869 and reunited them for the film's climax.Composer John Lanchbery has contributed a splendid soundtrack to the restored video version incorporating several contemporaneous tunes of the period. It would be intriguing to double bill THE IRON HORSE with Cecil B. DeMille's UNION PACIFIC 1939 which tells the same historical story but with a completely different tack  set of fictional characters.";

	schema:reviewBody "THE IRON HORSE Fox 1924 directed by John Ford is an story set during the middle of the 19th century America about the building of the first Transcontinental Railroad. One of the very best examples of a lavish scale western produced during the silent era said to be the answer to Paramount's earlier production of THE COVERED WAGON 1923 but most importantly the first major project for Ford after nearly a decade in the director's chair to now gain the recognition he truly deserves.The story opens with a prologue set in Springfield Ill. 1853 revolving around Davy Brandon first as a youngster Winston Miller with deep affection towards Miriam Marsh Peggy Cartwright his childhood sweetheart. Davy's father James Gordon is a surveyor who dreams about the crossing of the western wilderness while Miriam's father Thomas Marsh William Walling is a skeptic. However one of the citizens Abraham Lincoln Charles Edward Bull believes in this man's theory and knows he'll accomplish his means. Setting out to accompany his father on a mission to survey an appropriate route through the mountains for the coming railroad Davy bids a tearful farewell to Miriam. During their westward journey Davy who is hidden away because of foreseen danger witnesses the brutal killing of his father by a white man dressed up as an Indian whose only identification if the loss of a thumb and two fingers on his right hand. After burying his father Davy is taken in by a passing scouting party. A decade later 1862 Abraham Lincoln is president of the United States Davy George O'Brien is a Pony Express rider out to fulfill his father's dream leading into the building of the Transcontinental Railroad and Miriam Madge Bellamy now engaged to Peter Jesson Cyril Chadwick an Eastern surveyor working for her father actually working for Deroux Fred Kohler the richest landowner who stands to profit if the railroad goes through instead of through the pass. After being reunited with Miriam Jesson finds himself in stiff competition. The two men become bitter enemies especially after Jesson's attempts in doing away with him. Matters become complex until the golden spike gets hammered into the rail on that historic day of 1869 as east meets west through the continental railroad.In the supporting cast are Gladys Hulett Ruby Jack O'Brien Dinny three musketeer pals of J. Farrell MacDonald Corporal Casey Francis Powers Sergeant Slattery and James Welch Private Schultz as well as historical figures of Buffalo Bill Cody Wild Bill Hickock and John Hay enacted by George Wagner John Padjan and Stanhope Wheatcroft.THE IRON HORSE title indicating the locomotive train plays like a D.W. Griffith production with prologue historical figures flashbacks and epilogue and like a screen adaptation to an Edna Ferber novel telling its story through the passage of time along with soapopera ingredients complicated love triangle but no usual conclusions of central characters going through the white hair and wrinkles aging process. Overall this is John Ford's storytelling clich as it may be placing fictional characters against historic setting along with the ofttold murdermystery subplot of a son out to avenge his father's killer a historical movie that's become an important part of cinema history. Ford the future four time Academy Award winning director with a handful of motion pictures to his credit best known for westerns would provide similar themes in his future filmmaking. As popular as THE IRON HORSE was back in 1924 it's amazing that Ford didn't attempt doing a remake especially in 1939 when westerns reached it peak of popularity. It took Cecil B. DeMille to attempt a similar story with UNION PACIFIC Paramount 1939 starring Barbara Stanwyck and Joel McCrea. Like THE IRON HORSE UNION PACIFIC which tells its story in over two hours features villains Indian massacres and thousands of extras. George O'Brien a rugged actor was an ideal choice for the role of Davy Brandon. Although he worked under Ford's direction numerous times in latter years and showed his capability as a dramatic actor in F.W. Murnau's SUNRISE 1927 he never achieved major stardom. He did work steadily mostly in B westerns through the early 1950s. Costar Madge Bellamy offers her typical heroine performance caught between two men who vie for her affection but is far from being a strong character. While the acting overall is satisfactory from today's viewpoint some heavy melodramatics as the method of fainting by youngster Davy after witnessing his father's massacre or Bellamy's performance in general might provoke some laughter. Scenes such as these can be overlooked by great location scenery as Monument Valley a race against time and action scenes typically found in Ford westerns.Television history to THE IRON HORSE began when it became one of the movies from the Paul Killiam collection to air on public television's 13week series of The Silent Years JuneSeptember 1975 hosted by Lillian Gish. In her profile about THE IRON HORSE accompanied by an excellent piano score by William Perry Gish talks about its location shooting in the Nevada desert the use of 100 cooks to feed the huge cast and 5000 extras consisting of 3000 railway workers 1000 Chinese laborers many horses and steers. Decades later THE IRON HORSE made it to the American Movie Classics 19971999 and Turner Classic Movies TCM premiere December 9 2007  accompanied by orchestral score with 15 minutes of additional footage as opposed to the 119 minutes presented on both The Silent Years and the Western Channel in 2001. Distributed to home video Critic's Choice in 1997 availability on DVD came a decade later.THE IRON HORSE may not be historically accurate as promised through its opening intertitles but it's sure an ambitious John Ford production to still be entertaining today.

	schema:headline " One of the great early Westerns still recommendable.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Iron Horse was both Ford's 50th film and one of the most important silent Westerns. Until the 29yearold director came to work on this epic project he had gradually built up an expertise and standing with a number of smaller productions many of them oaters few of which survive today. This 1924 film consolidated his talent and gave him a creative reputation which lasted until he was deemed 'old fashioned' at the start of 1950s.It's a story that characteristically combines the grand with the intimate through a celebration of the coming of progress. The Iron Horse's narrative covers such issues as the Civil War Lincoln's presidency the Indian wars Buffalo Bill Wild Bill Hickok ethnic relationships cattle trailing and railway history in a span of little over two hours  all with an absence of narrative strain still impressive today. Ford's skill in marshalling many disparate elements into one large canvas successfully orchestrating history proudly announced here as 'accurate and faithful in every particular' is one example why he was such an exemplary Western director.George O'Brien plays Davy Brandon whose father dreams of rails eventually crossing the continent. After setting out for the west Brandon senior is killed by the evil Two Fingers Fred Kohler. Years later Davy sets to work for Union Pacific scouting for a short cut through Cheyenne territory that will ensure the success of the transcontinental link up. Aiming to prevent this are the dastardly forces of corrupt surveyor Jesson Peter Chadwick and halfbreed Baumann Kohler. Meanwhile Davy discovers his childhood sweetheart Miriam Madge Bellamy is engaged to the disreputable Jesson. The rest as they say is history. Throughout Ford's career he was wont to use symbols to indicate the coming of progress in the West. In My Darling Clementine 1946 it was the social dance at the unfinished church. In Liberty Valance 1964 the desert flowers on Tom Doniphon's Wayne's coffin. The Iron Horse is dedicated to George Stevenson and not unexpectedly here it is the railway itself that represents the growth of civilisation. Its ultimate success as an enterprise is less that of a profitable commercial venture than of beneficial ideal as visualised by President Lincoln. Amidst the idealism of railway expansion Ford includes the broad comedy common to many of his films  the Irish and Italian labourers continuing a friendly rivalry. Their work songs spelt out in caption cards while they construct the track punctuate the action creating convenient breathing spaces between more dramatic scenes. The 'three musketeers'  as Slattery Francis Powers Casey Farrell Macdonald and Schultz Jim Welch are called  have their own amusing scenes based around some frontier dentistry. But essentially they function as a kind of comic chorus their earthy ethnic interjections keeping the film's idealism down to earth. There's an element of this too in Judge Haller James Marcus a Roy Bean character whose dispensation of frontier justice is as arbitrary as it is often inspired. Least convincing to the modern viewer is the character of Miriam whose simpering virginity comes closest to the twodimensional women found often in the world of D.W. Griffith's melodramas. Her condemnation of the clean living Davy's visit to the saloon immediately after being with her where ironically he has gone to patch things up with Jesson seems almost wilfully annoying ludicrous even given the rough environment in which she finds herself. But that her heart belongs to the muscular scout is never in doubt a fact made clear by their rapport in the opening scenes set in their childhood. In addition once she has gained womanhood her pending relationship with Jesson is condemned by implication as President Lincoln looks askance at their match. The same dramatic shorthand is employed through the palpable tension when Davy and Baumann first meet an impending confrontation telegraphed as sharply as any message sent by mechanical means. There is also a intense psychological antipathy between Davy and Jesson notably in the standout barroom scene. In these moments O'Brien plays well almost making one forget Ford's great films with Wayne to come. But by necessity this is principally a film of the great outdoors where Ford excels in portraying man battling against external obstacles rather than facing internal stress. In his Stagecoach 1938 which was to later revitalise the genre it would be a different story one of comparative intimacy. Here the heroes and villains who react together along the railroad work out their differences in the open air with grand gestures fisticuffs and work songs rather than anguished conversation. And it is these epic scenes that remain in the mind when the film is done. The attack of the Indians on the supply train their furious shadows thrown against the sides of the carriages the snow swept work camps the many panoramas of frontier life Davy and Bauman's final conflict in the sleeper 'house' the final meeting at Promontory Point for the 'wedding of the rails' and so on.Such visual grandness does not preclude economy however. One only has to think of hurriedly arranged burial of 'the old soak' and the marriage held at North Platte or the establishing scenes at the beginning of the film to see how Ford was fully in command of his material switching scale and focus with ease. With the joining of the two railroads and the closing of the bond between Miriam and Davy there is a natural conclusion to both the human and the mechanical elements of the story  Davy actually waits until the final spike has been driven home before committing himself to her side. Thematically Fritz Lang was to acknowledge a debt to Ford's classic in his Western Union 1938 which has a related story but his film is the slighter of the two and less innocent. Ford's epic remains the definitive telling of these particular events and its authenticity can still be recommended today.".

	schema:reviewBody "Previous to directing The Iron Horse John Ford had been known as the director of a few dozen B westerns most of them probably lost by now and most of them starring Harry Carey. In getting the assignment for The Iron Horse Ford got his first really big budget to work with from Fox Films. The end result was a film which along with Paramount's The Covered Wagon became the models for the big epic westerns. And it launched a whole new career for John Ford that netted four Oscars as a Best Director though not one of them was for a western.The story of The Iron Horse begins here in Springfield Illinois where the children of Will Walling a contractor and surveyor James Gordon are playing while their fathers are meeting with none other than Abraham Lincoln at that time just a state legislator. Both would like to see a transcontinental railroad and Gordon is going to make good on it by going west and surveying the best route through the Rocky Mountains. But out west the surveyor is killed by hostile Indians led by a white man with only two fingers on his right hand. But the boy hides and is missed and grows up to be frontiersman George O'Brien.Twenty years later in the midst of the great Civil War President Abraham Lincoln signs the legislation authorizing the building of such a railroad though the real work doesn't start until the war is over. By that time Will Walling is working on building the Union Pacific and his daughter has grown up to be Madge Bellamy. She's engaged to Cyril Chadwick another surveyor but Chadwick has some mixed loyalties.Those of you who saw the epic DeMille production Union Pacific will recognize from this point some of the same plot situations. No doubt Cecil B. DeMille borrowed quite a bit from The Iron Horse but I will say DeMille wrecked his train during the Indian attack and it was a beauty. But Ford with all the extras involved could say that his was to use the clich a cast of thousands.The real evil villain here just as Brian Donlevy was in Union Pacific is Fred Kohler. He's behind a lot of the scheming as he's a large landowner where the Cheyenne Indians seem to function as a personal army. Now that was a bit much to swallow. As was the fact that when the grown up George O'Brien first makes his appearance he is identified as a Pony Express rider. Everyone knows that the Pony Express was a year long phenomenon that the Civil War closed down and the telegraph and railroad put out of business permanently. But Ford was also interested in the poetry of the west rather than the facts. Still the action of The Iron Horse holds up remarkably well today and the careers of both John Ford and George O'Brien were made with this film.".

But out west the surveyor is killed by hostile Indians led by a white man with only two fingers on his right hand. But the boy hides and is missed and grows up to be frontiersman George O'Brien.Twenty years later in the midst of the great Civil War President Abraham Lincoln signs the legislation authorizing the building of such a railroad though the real work doesn't start until the war is over. By that time Will Walling is working on building the Union Pacific and his daughter has grown up to be Madge Bellamy. She's engaged to Cyril Chadwick another surveyor but Chadwick has some mixed loyalties.Those of you who saw the epic DeMille production Union Pacific will recognize from this point some of the same plot situations. No doubt Cecil B. DeMille borrowed quite a bit from The Iron Horse but I will say DeMille wrecked his train during the Indian attack and it was a beauty. But Ford with all the extras involved could say that his was to use the clich a cast of thousands.The real evil villain here just as Brian Donlevy was in Union Pacific is Fred Kohler. He's behind a lot of the scheming as he's a large landowner where the Cheyenne Indians seem to function as a personal army. Now that was a bit much to swallow. As was the fact that when the grown up George O'Brien first makes his appearance he is identified as a Pony Express rider. Everyone knows that the Pony Express was a year long phenomenon that the Civil War closed down and the telegraph and railroad put out of business permanently. But Ford was also interested in the poetry of the west rather than the facts. Still the action of The Iron Horse holds up remarkably well today and the careers of both John Ford and George O'Brien were made with this film.";

Brandon heads with Davy to the west where he finds a possible pass for the railroad. However a group of Cheyenne led by a white renegade kills and scalps Brandon Davy who is hidden sees that the killer has only two fingers in his right hand. In June 1862 President Abraham Lincoln Charles Edward Bull authorizes the construction of two railroads the Union Pacific from Omaha Nebraska to West and the Central Pacific from Sacramento California to East. His old friend Thomas Marsh is responsible for the construction of the Union Pacific and his daughter Miriam Madge Bellamy is engaged of his engineer Jesson Cyril Chadwick. After many incidents during the construction Thomas Marsh is short of money and he needs to find a shortcut other than the original route through Smoky River. However the powerful Bauman Fred Kohler that owns the lands where the railroad should pass bribes Jesson to keep the original route. When the grownup Davy George O'Brien appears in the town bringing the mail Miriam is glad in meeting him and he tells to Thomas that his father had discovered a pass through the Black Hills. Thomas assigns Jesson to ride with Davy to check the ravine but Bauman convinces the engineer to kill the rival. Jesson cuts the rope that Davy is using to descent to the pass returns to town and tells that Davy had an accident and died. However when Davy returns to town he discloses the truth and the situation of the engineer becomes unbearable. The desperate Bauman uses the two fingered renegade to convince the Cheyenne to war against the workers and Davy has the chance to meet the killer of his father. On 10 May 1869 the locomotives 116 and Jupiter meets each other in the intersection of the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific.The Iron Horse is indeed an impressive silent epic western of John Ford. Of course this western is flawed with excessive patriotism subplots and running time of 150 minutes. But considering the limited and primitive technical resources in 1924 it is amazing how the director could have made for example the scene of the stampede or the Cheyenne attack. Further there are unusual angles of camera and the take from below the train arriving to save the workers is sensational in the prime cinema that used huge cameras. The plot seems to be based on the true story of the two NorthAmerican transcontinental railroads and the lead story of Davy Miriam and her father is engaging. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Cavalo de Ferro Iron Horse".

	schema:reviewBody "In the mid1920s cinema saw the second coming of the epic the first having been in the mid1910s and giants of the era such as Douglas Fairbanks and Cecil B. DeMille were continually upping the ante on each other with bigger and bigger pictures. Meanwhile the Western had been in gradual development and by now it was only logical that this everpopular genre was itself given a massiveness makeover. Paramount had the first stab with The Covered Wagon in 1923 and the following year Fox responded with The Iron Horse.The Western itself of course went through many developments in theme and can be grouped into different phases. The Iron Horse along with Covered Wagon Three Bad Men 1926 and The Big Trail 1930 belongs squarely to the pioneer Westerns which dominate this era. In these pictures the west would typically be an unclaimed wilderness and the heroes were those who explored settled and developed it. By now the genuine old west was fading from living memory and so now we had the first generation for whom it could be a romanticised piece of history. Plus of course there is the fact that the wagon trails railroads and cattle drives of the pioneer Western were ideal for the aforementioned fashion for epic pictures.Today of course The Iron Horse is best remembered for its director  a young John Ford. Even back then Ford had a close association with the Western although to some extent his style is still in development here. His shot composition relies heavily on very distinctive framing devices such as tree branches or posts and sometimes the shots look a little cluttered. Also his approach to the romantic love scenes is entirely conventional  with closeups rhyming angles and sparse backgrounds so as to focus on the actors. The older more cynical? John Ford tended to shoot these moments rather flatly the camera hanging back and even throwing in distracting background business.On the other hand and perhaps in ways that matter more this is very much the same John Ford of Stagecoach Fort Apache and so forth. In particular is his vision of the west. Right from the opening scenes he contrasts the smallness of the homestead with the romantic allure of the wilderness  framing the actors tightly in the opening shots and then cutting to pointofview shots of the trail. He always captures the vastness of the outdoors and yet without ever dwarfing the people in it. Particularly impressive and this is perhaps where Ford's greatest strength lay is his ability to combine different storytelling elements in a single shot  for example at one point we see a mother mourn her son at his grave in the foreground while a heavily loaded train passes through in the background.Another typically Fordian element is the precedence he gives to the comic relief characters. On location they were largely working without a script so Ford could spin their scenes out as long as he wanted. As with many of his later pictures charming though it is the comedy business threatens to unbalance the real story. We can also see in Drill ye terriers a forerunner to the group singsong that is a staple of even the earliest John Ford talkies.A nod to the actors is also due. This was George O'Brien's first lead role and he doesn't do badly considering he got the part mainly for being a goodlooking newcomer who could ride a horse. He doesn't emote too convincingly but he moves well which is the most important thing for a picture like this. The other standout is J. Farrell MacDonald who played the kind of roles for Ford in the silent era that would later be filled by Victor McLaglan in the talkies  basically a comical Irish drunk. But like McLaglan he hid real dramatic talent under the act and he emerges as the most genuine player in this piece.Ford's confidence and passion for the genre make the Iron Horse a classic but it's worth remembering that The Iron Horse is also a triumph of postproduction. Cast and crew had gone on location without a complete shooting script and large chunks of it are more or less improvised. As well as directing Ford took one of his earliest credits of producer and would thus have been able to continue supervising the product after shooting was over. It's hard to imagine what any other producer or editor would have made of the footage he brought back from location. It's unlikely they would have kept so much of the comic diversions and oirishness and it's perhaps with The Iron Horse that we have  for better or for worse  the earliest example of an unbridled John Ford.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of greatest John Ford's film I have ever saw. This epicscale silent western was hugely influential on outdoor films that followed it due to its large production. The Iron Horse was a massive production that employed over 6000 people two temporary cities were built to accommodate them with 100 cooks on hand to serve meals. The project of Fox was the response to the film The Covered Wagon 1923 the Paramount which was a huge box office hit draw. Shot on location in Arizona in Monument Valley. John Ford love the location so much due to its romantic scenery that he film most of his westerns there after this. Surprising this movie wasn't directed by John Ford himself but Kevin Brownlow and David Gill but you can truly see Ford's influence in the film. The film is about Davy Brandon George O'Brien who follows his father's dream that the entire North American continent will be linked by railroad East to West. However to make this dream a reality a clear trail must be found through the Rocky Mountains. However the trial is dangerous with Indians raids led by a white man name Peter Jesson or Two fingers Cyril Chadwick. In some versions he is known as Bauman or Deroux but its Jesson's first right. Trust me. He is named 'Two fingers' due to the lack of fingers on his right hand. Chadwick really had only two fingers on the one hand having lost the others in a mining accident before he became an actor. When legislation signed by President Abraham Lincoln has made it an official mandate. Davy is hired on as a railroad surveyor by Thomas Marsh Will R. Walling the father of his childhood sweetheart Miriam Madge Bellamy. While Davy hopes to win Miriam's heart he discover that Miriam is already married and shocked to discover her husband is Peter Jesson now working with the railroad as a civil engineer. As the Union Pacific crew presses on to their historic meeting at Promitory Point Davy must find a way to earn Miriam's love and uncover Peter's murderous past. The Iron Horse has become one of the biggest successes of Fox in the era of silent films. The film overall theme is the rebirth of a nation by its unification physical and symbolic after the terrible Civil War that divided the country. The film presents an idealized symbol image of the construction of the American first transcontinental railroad. It culminates with the scene of driving of the golden spike at Promontory Summit on May 10 1869. A historical real life date. There is a note in the title before this scene that the two original locomotives from 1869 event are used in the film although this is false  both engines Union Pacific No. 119 and Central Jupiter were scrapped before 1910. Still it's pretty close to what it must have felt to be there witnessing East meeting West. The movie nearly mirrors the ending to Union Pacific 1939. I can't help wondering how many times C. B. DeMille watched the Indian attack on the train before he borrowed many elements from it to use in Union Pacific? I think this movie influence that later film. Still I can do without the title cards telling us that we are watching a film or how they film it. It took me out of the film a bit since it's pretty much telling you don't get too into the film it's just a bunch of actors acting. It's breaks like that that detract the audience from the real story and action. Come on you don't need that. Make the film seems like it's really happening. The film had some very interesting characters I love the unabashed masculine chivalry and heroism by the hero Davy. Despite the oddly wild air swinging badly done fight scenes. I love the loving strongwilled independent women as seem in Miriam. It's odd seeing an old film where women are shooting guns and going to battle. The supporting comedic characters were also funny. You get a bit of the Victor Mclaglen and Ward Bond lovable misfits that permeated Ford's later films in Sgt. Slattery and Cpl. Casey. You get a really funny part in similar scenes such as the dentist getting the guys to join the fight by having a stampede and a lot of weird Irish jokes. The action was welldone. It was just as good as any modern film. There are two versions of this film. John Ford used two negative simultaneously which was a common practice at the time. One was for use in the United States that runs for 149 minutes and the other for other countries which 133 minute runtime. The international has a lot secondary takes and other shots unused in the editing room just to note. Still the movie goes a little too long after the Indian battle in the American version. The International version is more tightly edited. Many years the only copy that was shown was the international version. For years the American version wasn't available for viewing. All early Fox Films original negatives were destroyed in a fire in 1937 until it was found. The negative American original was restored in 2007 and a new musical background was commissioned and now both can be seen. The score is likewise very good. Just wish we could had heard the traditional tune of the railroad songs like 'Drill Ye Tarrier Drill. There is a black  white version Handcoloring and a tan brown version. Watch the tan version it looks like a dusty Western indeed. Unless you are a silent film enthusiast or an aficionado of Westerns then you are probably unfamiliar with this movie so check it out. Overall I am very happy to have this in my collection".

	onyx:emotionText "One of greatest John Ford's film I have ever saw. This epicscale silent western was hugely influential on outdoor films that followed it due to its large production. The Iron Horse was a massive production that employed over 6000 people two temporary cities were built to accommodate them with 100 cooks on hand to serve meals. The project of Fox was the response to the film The Covered Wagon 1923 the Paramount which was a huge box office hit draw. Shot on location in Arizona in Monument Valley. John Ford love the location so much due to its romantic scenery that he film most of his westerns there after this. Surprising this movie wasn't directed by John Ford himself but Kevin Brownlow and David Gill but you can truly see Ford's influence in the film. The film is about Davy Brandon George O'Brien who follows his father's dream that the entire North American continent will be linked by railroad East to West. However to make this dream a reality a clear trail must be found through the Rocky Mountains. However the trial is dangerous with Indians raids led by a white man name Peter Jesson or Two fingers Cyril Chadwick. In some versions he is known as Bauman or Deroux but its Jesson's first right. Trust me. He is named 'Two fingers' due to the lack of fingers on his right hand. Chadwick really had only two fingers on the one hand having lost the others in a mining accident before he became an actor. When legislation signed by President Abraham Lincoln has made it an official mandate. Davy is hired on as a railroad surveyor by Thomas Marsh Will R. Walling the father of his childhood sweetheart Miriam Madge Bellamy. While Davy hopes to win Miriam's heart he discover that Miriam is already married and shocked to discover her husband is Peter Jesson now working with the railroad as a civil engineer. As the Union Pacific crew presses on to their historic meeting at Promitory Point Davy must find a way to earn Miriam's love and uncover Peter's murderous past. The Iron Horse has become one of the biggest successes of Fox in the era of silent films. The film overall theme is the rebirth of a nation by its unification physical and symbolic after the terrible Civil War that divided the country. The film presents an idealized symbol image of the construction of the American first transcontinental railroad. It culminates with the scene of driving of the golden spike at Promontory Summit on May 10 1869. A historical real life date. There is a note in the title before this scene that the two original locomotives from 1869 event are used in the film although this is false  both engines Union Pacific No. 119 and Central Jupiter were scrapped before 1910. Still it's pretty close to what it must have felt to be there witnessing East meeting West. The movie nearly mirrors the ending to Union Pacific 1939. I can't help wondering how many times C. B.

	schema:reviewBody "1st watched 10252013  7 out of 10DirJohn Ford Epic silent movie about the path to the completion of the transcontinental railroad seen thru the eyes of the son of a dreamfilled midwesterner played by George O'Brien in adulthood. This movie does a pretty good job of portraying the conflicts in the effort  while throwing in some romance with a few fist fights. John Ford the King of the Western directed this early movie and is not afraid to show men having emotion and being aggressive as males are expected to be. George's character Dave Brandon travels with his father to the west in search of helping the railroad get built but his father is killed by a white man dressed as an Indian and traveling with their tribe. This man becomes the evil character in the film an we find out he also is tight with the railroad executives and owns a lot of land. We believe his intention is to make sure the railroad goes thru his areas so they will thrive and make him money although it is not really dramatized. This piece is somewhat historical in nature with some comedy romance and violence thrown in coming a lot from the romantic triangle between Brandon his childhood girlfriend and her new fianc. The fight scenes are a little corny and sometimes unnecessary but some of the emotions come out due to this and help the film in my opinion. Ford makes the film entertaining and not just a bland documentary which it could have been. His ability to entertain an audience shines and the film also teaches which is a positive thing as well. Overall  a worthwhile film although not perfect.".

Suffice to say that in the closing scene not a spoiler as we already know what happened at Promontory Point a bunch of bigwigs Leland Stanford etc. pose for a group photograph in front of the two locomotives the original two that met at the actual event if the title card is to be believed the Jupiter from the C.P. and 116 from the U.P.. The picture is taken but the movie viewer wonders who all these people are as in real life the big important people in society get the credit and fame for a job that was done by the unimportant but very interesting little people.This movie is about those little people pretty much all of them it sometimes seems and in it a young John Ford does all the things right that as an older man he would get wrong in Cheyenne Autumn. Ford was making The Iron Horse for audiences who were already familiar with the gritty realism in William S. Hart's films so he had to give it almost a documentary feel in some parts as another commenter noticed. There's also a lot of giveandtake between ethnic groups that at times gets pretty sharpedged just like reality but it always and sometimes very subtly is resolved by their work on a common project for a common goal.Ford also seems to build clichs just to blow them away. Spoiler coming up. The big Indian attack on workers at the end of the line goes pretty much as we expect at first up to the point where the reinforcements arriveno cavalry in this movie it is fellow workers coming to the rescue but only after a verbal brawl between the Irish and the Italians back in town which was resolved when Texans arrived with several thousand cattle and when they saw what was going on stampeded them through town to force the Italians to get onto the relief train Ford uses his excellent run directly into the camera view with the stampede and also a few other places in the film. See what I mean about layers? Right back at the end of the line the Indians are still whooping it up in a circle around the workers who are holed up under the cars. Reinforcements arrive and drive the Indians off. But then the Indians regroup line up and charge cavalry style. Things look desperate for our heroes but they are finally rescued...by more Indians.It's a wellprepared surprise and that is so enjoyable. There are no deus ex machina moments in The Iron Horse you just start wondering what is going to happen next and watch it all come together perfectly.Other excellent points include the casting of Charles Edward Bull as Lincoln what else did he do I wonder his IMDb bio is empty. The bar fight scene is excellent too and so is the death match between Davy and Two Fingers which O'Brien's training as a fighter makes especially realistic.By the way Miriam doesn't care that Davy went into a bar her problem is that Davy broke his word by fighting Jesson after telling her he would not. It's a really stupid move on her part and the audience recognizes that  kind of an old melodrama touch but it keeps the story moving.It's interesting to see Ford's explanation of the buffalo hunts in this movie they were food for the workers and contrast it to the one suggested in The Searchers they were slaughtered to starve the native people off the land.Well enough. See this movie. It's over 2 hours long how many reels was that I wonder and that is just the right length.".

	schema:headline " Important Film for Ford and Fox";
	schema:reviewBody "Iron Horse The 1924  12 out of 4 John Ford's first epic was a massive production for Fox who pretty much spent a ton of money hoping that the film would bring people in which it eventually did. The film made a ton of money for Fox but more important it took Ford out of the gutters of B Westerns and made him a director to be reckoned with. The film tells the true story of the first transcontinental railroad as Davy Brandon George O'Brien tries to fulfill the dreams of his father who was killed by Indians years earlier. Davy must also try to win the heart of a former love Madge Bellamy while fighting off a man who wants to see the railroad fail. There's no question that Ford and Fox pretty much threw everything into this film and you can tell because it's story is all over the place. While I think the film isn't nearly as good as its reputation you still can't help but be impressed by many of the visuals. According to legend there were over 6000 people employed on the production with most of them being extras to give all the scenes a more epic look. I'd believe this legend because the scenery is downright beautiful to look at and there's no question that it has the look of a mammoth epic. The highlight for me were all the scenes where we see the railroad being built as the boards are placed and railings hammered down. There were many future films that dealt with the railroad but I must say this one here makes it look the most realistic. We get many other great action scenes including countless fights with the Indians where once again you can see the large scale with the amount of people horses and of course stunt men. I think what really hurts the film is the fact that it really doesn't tell a clear story. I'm not sure if the film originally ran much longer but the 135minute running time feels way too long but the reason for this is that so much happens and often times it doesn't really connect together. Instead of telling one full story it seems the screenplay bounces all over the place and tries to tell as much as possible. One minute we're dealing with the railroad and then we jump to some town being built up. One moment we're dealing with the Indians but the next moment we're worried about the dress Bellamy is going to wear. It feels as if we're just getting countless vignettes pieced together without much need to bring everything together. Perhaps Fox was going for a Cecil B. DeMille type epic but this here didn't fully work. The film starts off saying that the history is true but that's clearly not the case as there are certain historic figures used in the film that had no place in the original events like Buffalo Bill. Both O'Brien and Bellamy are good in their roles as are Cyril Chadwick George Waggner Will Walling and Charles Edward Bull who plays President Lincoln. THE IRON HORSE is certainly worth watching once for its importance to film history and while there are many impressive moments on the whole I think the film comes up a tad bit short.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE IRON HORSE is a plot heavy western with what appears to be an authentic historical background well photographed in crisp BW photography that is not as primitive as one might expect from a film made in 1924. It bustles with excitement whenever any action scenes are taking place accompanied by a silent music score that actually fits the story and never becomes tiresome.GEORGE O'BRIEN has the lead but doesn't enter the film until at least fifty minutes is taken up with a prologue involving old Abe Lincoln himself and the friendship of two children who are soon separated but destined to meet again midway through the story when they're adults. The girl is played as a young woman by MADGE BELLAMY. She and O'Brien become romantically attached although she's now the fianc of one of the villains of the piece. There's also a subplot involving the man who killed O'Brien's father Bauman FRED KOHLER who is a white man joining the Indians for attacks on the iron horse.Some of the acting is strictly silent film technique and there's the usual John Ford inclusion of comedy relief from actors like J. FARRELL MacDONALD long stretches of captioned talk for scenes that run too long with exposition but decent work from O'Brien and Bellamy as the leads.It's pioneering in the Ford mold obviously a film that employed a huge cast to portray the building of the Union Pacific railway to the west telling a fictional story of romance and danger with authority.Worth viewing although at two hours and ten minutes it can sometimes try your patience. All the hard work that went into the making of the film is evident throughout.".

There's also a subplot involving the man who killed O'Brien's father Bauman FRED KOHLER who is a white man joining the Indians for attacks on the iron horse.Some of the acting is strictly silent film technique and there's the usual John Ford inclusion of comedy relief from actors like J. FARRELL MacDONALD long stretches of captioned talk for scenes that run too long with exposition but decent work from O'Brien and Bellamy as the leads.It's pioneering in the Ford mold obviously a film that employed a huge cast to portray the building of the Union Pacific railway to the west telling a fictional story of romance and danger with authority.Worth viewing although at two hours and ten minutes it can sometimes try your patience. All the hard work that went into the making of the film is evident throughout.";

Actually some early negatives I'd read had me worried that I would be irritated I spent the money instead I've already decided to buy this when it comes out.Overall I'd say if you like romping easy movies like The Mummy National Treasure and Lake Placid you'll like this plus refreshingly without being sickeningly sweet there is not one swear word or sexedup scene so take the older kids and Grandma. I thought Nicolas Cage was excellent he looked great and can wear a leather duster better than most and there was some nice chemistry between Cage and Baruchel. Alred Molina looked like he was having fun and is such an enjoyable villain. Baruchel does a good job  he is so geeky at times it is a tad painful  and I found myself rooting for him. The 2 main female characters are lovely and appealing personalities.More pluses A lively pace and I never lost interest plus a fair number of laughs. Some interesting character twists with the oily young rockstar magician helping Molina and some very funny cheeky nods to the original animated Fanatasia  watch for the nod to Star Wars. Great and interesting special effects that made sense when they were used. Even the way the actors moved when they were doing magic was very good for some reason the wandwaving in Harry Potter sometimes reminds me of people using a flyswatter or shaking a bug off a stick that didn't happen in this film.So no this isn't some classic of cinema it is what it is and is a bit thin here and there but it's also quite good for a magical romp and is in no way a bad film or a waste of money. I could have done without the occasional background songs which seemed designed to emphasize romantic angst or appeal to young teenagers but that was bearable. I saw this at an early evening show and there were not many people in the theater but we all laughed and there was applause at the end and we left the theater smiling. Personally I think the critics panning this are full of BS or are trying to prove what intellectuals they are. In the meantime see this with your family or take your friends and then go out and get some ice cream and sit outside and enjoy summer. Hope they make a sequel too.".

The fun is in Cage's ability to be annoyed with the kid and like him at the same time. The CGI is enough to enhance the story but not overwhelm it. All four of my kids ages 411 liked it. Some parts might be a little scary but not too bad a dragon clomping around is all. Fun family flick.PS I also liked that the hero held a door for a girl.

	schema:reviewBody "Rating 12 out of 4. I had little to no expectations for Disney's latest animatedtolive action translation THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE. It looked like serviceable popcorn entertainment lots of jarring CGI effects and slapstick humor. Turns out it's true that minimal expectations help in seeing a movie in its own terms and as familyfilm trifle APPRENTICE delivers if not much else.Exposition abounds when we are introduced to the plot which opens in 700 A.D. where great Wizard Merlin is killed by his evil adversary Morgana Alice Krige in it for only a few minutes and passes his legacy to one of his young apprentices Balthazar holy smoke! It's Nicholas Cage!. Before his death Merlin hands him a tiny dragon statuette which turns into a ring which would determine the great wizard's heir. Oh yeah Balthazar also traps the souls of other wizards including the evil Morgana and sweetheart Monica Bellucci barely in it for other than being well Monica Bellucci inside a nesting doll called the Grimhold. Forward a thousand centuries later and Balthazar still in search of the bearer of Merlin's gifts finally comes upon a boy named Dave Stutler who is what else? A total nerd!. Forward a few years more and Dave now a geeky teenager Jay Baruchel is now ready to be trained with the Magical Arts which the movie explains is actually more connected to modern science than we thought and save the world. Whew! That's a lot of plot exposition for a movie based around a segment in Disney's Fantasia with Mickey Mouse no less!. And it moves so quickly from one situation to the other. But better to throw in dozens of special effects and action sequence. The special effects are nothing new the CGI reeks of CGI circa 1990. But this comes off a charm. With so many movies around throwing out fantasy for realism meaning lots of shaky you are there camera work THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE is a pretty close throwback to some of those 80's effectsheavy fantasy movies usually associated with Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic effects house the film reminds most of the effectsladen YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES when I saw the trailer. It's not so much as true movie magic than simply throwing in as much effects as they can to substitute for a lackluster actionoriented story.The actors aren't in such bad shape. Cage who's been on the slums lately is pretty good here though it's a bit of a stretch to call it an improvement over some of his previous roles. But he does have more fun here and I had more fun with him here it's in this role did I get the feeling that he knows very well that he looks ridiculous and goes to hell with it. Same goes for Alfred Molina turning in deliciously campy baddie with an accent Horvath. These two guys do better than the rest of the younger members. Baruchel is trying too hard to be your total loser turnedhero character when he really shouldn't. He seemed fine doing voiceover in HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON but he can't bring the role from animated world to reality. Teresa Palmer is your typical girlofyour dreams leading dame. Some actors Bellucci Krige barely makes what passes as appearances. THE SORCEROR'S APPRENTICE is fun and at a time where movies like these fail to deliver such simple mercies it's a pleasant little surprise.".

Turns out it's true that minimal expectations help in seeing a movie in its own terms and as familyfilm trifle APPRENTICE delivers if not much else.Exposition abounds when we are introduced to the plot which opens in 700 A.D. where great Wizard Merlin is killed by his evil adversary Morgana Alice Krige in it for only a few minutes and passes his legacy to one of his young apprentices Balthazar holy smoke! It's Nicholas Cage!. Before his death Merlin hands him a tiny dragon statuette which turns into a ring which would determine the great wizard's heir. Oh yeah Balthazar also traps the souls of other wizards including the evil Morgana and sweetheart Monica Bellucci barely in it for other than being well Monica Bellucci inside a nesting doll called the Grimhold. Forward a thousand centuries later and Balthazar still in search of the bearer of Merlin's gifts finally comes upon a boy named Dave Stutler who is what else? A total nerd!. Forward a few years more and Dave now a geeky teenager Jay Baruchel is now ready to be trained with the Magical Arts which the movie explains is actually more connected to modern science than we thought and save the world. Whew! That's a lot of plot exposition for a movie based around a segment in Disney's Fantasia with Mickey Mouse no less!. And it moves so quickly from one situation to the other. But better to throw in dozens of special effects and action sequence. The special effects are nothing new the CGI reeks of CGI circa 1990. But this comes off a charm. With so many movies around throwing out fantasy for realism meaning lots of shaky you are there camera work THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE is a pretty close throwback to some of those 80's effectsheavy fantasy movies usually associated with Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic effects house the film reminds most of the effectsladen YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES when I saw the trailer. It's not so much as true movie magic than simply throwing in as much effects as they can to substitute for a lackluster actionoriented story.The actors aren't in such bad shape. Cage who's been on the slums lately is pretty good here though it's a bit of a stretch to call it an improvement over some of his previous roles. But he does have more fun here and I had more fun with him here it's in this role did I get the feeling that he knows very well that he looks ridiculous and goes to hell with it. Same goes for Alfred Molina turning in deliciously campy baddie with an accent Horvath. These two guys do better than the rest of the younger members. Baruchel is trying too hard to be your total loser turnedhero character when he really shouldn't. He seemed fine doing voiceover in HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON but he can't bring the role from animated world to reality. Teresa Palmer is your typical girlofyour dreams leading dame. Some actors Bellucci Krige barely makes what passes as appearances. THE SORCEROR'S APPRENTICE is fun and at a time where movies like these fail to deliver such simple mercies it's a pleasant little surprise.";

I felt that Nicholas Cage and Jay Baruchel did very well with the parts they were given. I do wish they had more screen time to gel a little better. Alfred Molina as usual does a wonderful job as the evil villain but I wish his apprentice Toby Kebbell got more screen time. Some of the love story plot could have been given up for more magic scenes. I felt that Dave and Becky didn't really need all that screen time. I feel the movie is geared toward a younger audiences so to compare it to Inception is unfair no 10 year old is going to get that plot what so ever. Yes it was very predictable to me but not to my 5 year old sitting next to me. I went in expecting a well acted predictable easy plot with some things that would make me chuckle And that's exactly what I got.Overall the plot was easily understandable the actions a little predictable and the chemistry a little off with some of the characters. However give it a break I'm 23 and a mother of 4 and with all the children's movies I have seen this summer this is one I will actually buy when it come to DVD.Also I just have to say I love the main song Secrets by Onerepublic I have had it stuck in my head since I left the theater!".

I have always been a big movie goer since a young age and enjoy a broad range of films. As of late Disney has not brought forth any movies I have loved till now and between Jerry Bruckheimer Nicolas Cage Jay Baruchel and Alfred Molina the movie had great chemistry. The music and the fight scenes have Jerry Bruckheimer splashed all over them can be compared to Pirates of the Caribbean. As for Nicolas Cage many people I spoke with before and after the movie didn't believe he could pull off the roll of a Sorcerer yet his perception of Balthazar Blake as a wise cunning determined witty heart broken wizard gave the movie such positive energy and strength. Jay was perfect as Dave bringing his classic nerdy innocent character to the table as seen in many of his other films. His character represents Disney's persona of good and paired with Cage's interpretation of Balthazar there is a plethora of hilarityand anticipation. Alfred Molina playing the apposing force Maxim Horvath provided the movie with just the right amount of darkness to cater to the younger and older generations. Through out the movie Molina's character Horvath has a twisted mix of respect and hatred for Cage's character Balthazar and the two of them feed off the energy very well to create a great amount of conflict and excitement. These conflicts help detract from the typical corny air that many Disney movies have because they usually cater to a younger audience. The Sorcerer's Apprentice does cater to a younger audience but also provides enough action suspense and humor to cater to those of the older generation making it a great family movie. So to anyone who is questioning whether or not to see the film I highly recommend it!!! It is a great modern spin of the Disney Fantasia classic with comedy action suspense and romance that makes it appreciable to all. Between the awesome cast Jerry Bruckheimer and Jon Turteltaub the movie represents the real meaning behind the magic of Disney.".

A Star Wars reference made you wish you were watching that classic.Nothing seemed fresh. Situations and special effects seemed to be borrowed from other films of the same genre. Grasping for something good that would be the score and the sound.";

If I could ignore his annoying acting and all sorts of annoying noises he made mostly ohhh ohhh god ohhh man ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh nooo ahh ahh ahh then maybe just maybe I could ignore the sad excuse for a mega budge summer movie script. Worst thing about Baruchel's dialogue is he keeps repeating words combined with his annoying voice the overall acting is just too awful to bear for more than 5 minutes. Funny thing is Baruchel's character at a younger age was just as annoying. So for the most part I blame the character for the annoyance. Walt Disney really needs to fire the person responsible for taking this project on. This is a very bad movie. Only reason I watched it is because of Nicholas Cage but his reputation just took a beating for me. Really disappointing movie for Nicholas Cage. 010".

	schema:reviewBody "This weekend I got to see The Sorcerer's Apprentice the latest Disney released film from producer Jerry Bruckheimer. The plot of the movie is pretty much textbook Bruckheimer like his film Prince of Persia The Sands of Time which was released earlier in the year. While it's not quite as good as Prince of Persia The Sorcerer's Apprentice is still not bad.The premise is simple enough. Dave Stutler Played in his youth by Jake Cherry is a kid who one day wandered into a bizarre shop run by an out of the ordinary man named Balthazar Blake Played by Nicolas Cage a sorcerer. Blake offered him a mysterious ring shaped like a dragon and after a bit of unfortunate mishaps Dave set free Blake's archnemesis Maxim Horvath Played by Alfred Molina. Cut to ten years later where Dave Now played by Jay Baruchel is in college and has become quite the physics nerds and fallen in love with an old classmate Played by Teresa Palmer. But now Balthazar is back and tells Dave that the ring means he is the PrimeMerlinian a powerful wizard who will become the successor of Merlin himself. Dave becomes Balthazar's apprentice and together the two must stop Horvath and an evil sorceress from you guessed it taking over the world.So yeah story is been there done that. Awkward hero and scary mentor threat of global apocalypse simplistic action plot silly comic relief awkward romance it's all there. But it's what the movie does with that is why it's so fun and the action is actually fun to watch. Fast Paced Well staged and I have no problems with the pacing except for the prologue which feels pretty rushed and the ending which feels rushed and kind of abrupt as well.Performances in the movie are fun too. Jay Baruchel and Nicolas Cage's chemistry on screen is so much fun not only that but they're good on their own as well. I want to give some serious credit to Alfred Molina as well who's practically made a career out of being a scene stealer in any movie he's in. The rest of the cast while not fully developed most of them are fun to watch.The tech design of this movie is cool too. The visuals are nice to look at the sound mix and design is great and the production design is also cleverly done. Nice cinematography too and Trevor Rabin provides a typical yet not too shabby orchestral score.The Sorcerer's Apprentice is far from perfect. It's no Inception or Toy Story 3 but if you're looking for a fun entertaining popcorn flick to spend two hours at the cinema then this one isn't a bad choice.I give it 12 out of ".

Sometimes the action and excitement works in delirious ways a former Nicolas Cage vehicle Con Air and other times it sinks to new lows Bad Boys II. Most other times it's the home of the mallcineplex brand of generic mundane action movies that have competent direction and cinematography and are so overproduced that they sound much like the overproduced pop songs featured on the soundtrack. The Sorcerer's Apprentice another Bruckheimer movie directed by Jon Turtletaub and starring Cage is no exception. But the potential that is squandered is what is kind of sad. Kind of I say since it could have been worse.It's the old story of a young guy plucked up to be the chosen one because he has some kind of gift or he's just interested both are the case here and has a 'master' not a mentor there's a difference I guess who teaches him the ropes. Jay Baruchel and Cage play apprentice and master and they're facing off against Alfred Molina's Horvath one of three Merlin students who are now foes in 2010 vying to stopopen a vase with an evil witch in their who can destroy the world yada yada Baruchel has a girl he wants to be with andor protect so on so forth. The script is by the numbers so much so that watching the trailer you only get a hint as to how laidout everything is. If you guessed for example that there will be a moment when the young hero decides this isn't for him because it's too hard you guessed right. And if you guessed that he comes back you just won the 64000 dollars.What's the potential here? Not so much Jay Baruchel who once again plays the wimpy nerd who has a few clever one liners and is mostly just a bythebook nerdy guy worked much better in How to Train Your Dragon by the way. It's the older stars Cage and Molina that could have so much fun with their roles. On occasion they do and one can tell they had some thrills putting on their oldstyle costumes Cage in particular looking like he could be out of filmnoir as much as a sorcerer but the script gives them little to do except declare things to other characters and deliver exposition. It's sad especially to see Cage who had two roles in a role where he came alive Terence McDonaugh and Big Daddy slumming it in ways reminiscent of Next or Bangkok Dangerous. He takes the role where it goes but he's just really there all apart of the bland actionmovie veneer. Where's the excitement even if it's bad excitement when he flies a mechanical eagle across the sky or shoots fireballs?Perhaps for children this should do watching it I could imagine the Nostalgia Critic or Nostalgia Critic Jr taking it to task years down the line. It has cool special effects and a modern soundtrack and a goodlookin' female supporting love interest for Baruchel who will probably get a lot of work soon. It's also got a wooden plot and only one really neat actionchase scene in Times Square with mirrors. It's a mostly flat Hollywood endeavor with a few really talented people.".

Wonderful for any age entertaining and definitely going to be a classic for ages to come. many movies you find when they use magic it's very theatrical yet lacking making you feel it would have been better left out or just plain embarrassing this movie feels relateable with very normal characters while throwing in magic that is a little different then the usual you don't get the cringe feeling when they are doing it. We loved the music set for the movie that One Republic did and it happens to be a great tribute to Tesla it did get my kids more interested in what exactly it was and who the man was that invented it.".

This was to be expected of Loes Luca whose middle name is absurd but seeing how Carice van Houten pulls off painting a nondimensional character is amazing. She leaves Max Pell um Lepel and Pleun and you  and your children or grandchildren  guessing for almost the entire duration of the film. I knew she could play character roles with many dimensions but this role of her is an achievement in itself. Perhaps that's a kids' eye view of adults  at least it makes it easier even for someone pushing 50 to identify with the children. Lepel is called Lepel because he wears a bracelet that consists of a strand with 5 cubes with letters on his wrist L E P E L. Try to imagine these five letters in a circle. Now push the first two letters around the circle so that they end up being the last two and you get the boy's real name. Because he's lost his memory he doesn't know this. The fact that the alleged grandmother doesn't know the boy's name indicates that she is likely not be his real grandmother. The film also lightly brushes the subject of autism  the main character has trouble dealing with social relationships but is excellent with numbers. All in all an excellent underrated film. Suitable for children but there are layers in there that will please adults as well.".

But Lepel is a movie that should be watched without prejudices and it will give you a lot in return on the adult level.It is a movie about dreams a dreams that can't turn to reality analyzing limits how far can we go trying to live with or in them and what are the compromises we make not to give them up completely so at least a part of those dreams can come true.We see a boy who dreams his parents will return home. They are supposed to travel around the world that's what his grandmother tells him.. But she is abusing him while he is dreaming about his mother he doesn't see or doesn't care for abuse and for obvious lies she is telling him. We see a shy salesman in love with his female boss doing the best work to impress her but afraid to say a word let alone ask her for a date scared to lose the dream he lives in. We see a woman trained driver working in a store and dreaming of going to Africa rally but aware that she as a woman doesn't have a chance to do it  and still she keeps on practicing. We see a teacher eager to have his pupil win the mathematics contest ready to kidnap a boy help abuser cheat children just to have his dream come true. We see a girl victim of mother's abuse who only wants to stay unnoticed for as long as she can and never to have any mother again  but finding herself in situation to help a boy desperately seeking for one.And all the dreams will somehow be realized... but not a single in a simple way without sacrifices and compromises.A scene where a friendly salesman helps boy in search for new mother and more than a hundred women take part in interview asks us unpleasant questions about family in today society when many women offer themselves as fostermothers but mostly for selfish reasons ready to do and give only what the boy had in his previous dysfunctional family. And the only good adult female person refuses to be a mother because today families and parenting are so complicated that she feels she is not up to do it. People who have heart and conscience are rare and don't fit in our world.In most children movies runaway kids have numerous adventures they solve mysteries find treasures they are smarter than adults go from peril to peril and nothing can happen to them. And if they have a company police or secret services can't do anything to beat them.Kids in Lepel are not superheros. Yes Lepel runs away but he doesn't go to distant country or desert island. He lives in neighbourhood warehouse. A crowded place where he can hide but always in danger to be found. Yes a girl helps him. A girl who also lives there for a long time. Unbelievable? For a short while but then we learn that a salesman knows she is there he helps her all the time hides her prevents other people to find her hiding place. These makes the story almost realistic.But a big flaw waits as usually till the end. Our older hero Max salesman is a lousy driver. But to impress his boss who he is in love with he drives a borrowed car so good that she takes him as a codriver for the really race in Africa. And he drove so good only because a 8 year old boy who also of course isn't a driver tells him how to do it using his knowledge of maths... So goodbye driving instructors all you need is a kid and in a few minutes you are new Schumacher or Loeb.Other than that a film can be recommended to people who still have heart and conscience... and let's hope a family.".

She makes him do loads of work and he obviously dislikes it although he has gotten used to it I guess. He asks about his parents sometimes and his grandmother tells him timeandtime again they will return. One day while at a big warehouse his life turns upside down after receiving a balloon from a salesman. Then the ride actually begins we see the little kid making friends having personal troubles and desperately trying to do what he thinks is best. At one point he is told very bad news and there is where my hard part was. Until this point it was mostly about feeling good but here it changed for me... This is where I really got connected to the little kid played by Joep Truijen whose acting was actually very nice. The grandmother is played by Loes Luca whose performance is really great Neeltje de Vree plays Pleun and is not always up to par which is really too bad although her role is quite difficult. Barry Atsma playing Max is a little bit too much of a softy for me as for Juffrouw de Boer Carice van Houten I can't really comment on her we used to be in high school together thus my vision of her work is quite blurred.I would recommend this film for Sunday afternoons preferably with kids from age 7 until 1314.".

	schema:headline " When White Lilacs Bloom Again...";
	schema:reviewBody "After the idyllic images of the credits where spring is in the air we see something quite rare for 'Heimatfilme' so widespread in German postwar cinema. A middle aged man hides a knife behind his back. What does he need it for? Surely the early 1950s saw the audience bored with violence so...it is in no way a Hitchcocklike suspense or a thriller that could absorb even the most 'bored and skeptical' viewers. Soon however when we realize the comical motives of the man with the knife we put aside the violent expectation but sink within the 'kitschy' world of this film that some scholars would probably call 'chocolate with sugar.' WHEN WHITE LILACS BLOOM AGAIN  a true representative of a 'Heimatfilm'The whole storyline with more or less convincing aspects could be described as 'torments of a couple that cannot stand each other's differences and remain separated as long as someone important appears in between them and leads towards happy ending' Quite many lacks in character development and some inconsistencies of continuity. And yet WHEN WHITE LILACS BLOOM AGAIN is a movie that appears to be highly worth seeing and remains a milestone of German post war cinema...Perhaps it would be forgotten today if it did not play a significant role in the career of one actress who perhaps after Marlene Dietrich and Hildegard Knef was the most successful German speaking actress in the history of cinema. Directed by Hans Deppe it is a film where a great German star of the prewar period Magda Schneider along with other celebrities of the time introduces her child Rosemarie Retty Albach later known to the world as ROMY SCHNEIDER to the industry. 15 yearold Rosemarie by meeting the director Hans Deppe in Munich takes her best chance to get what she had dreamed of ever since she was small career as an actress. It is a joy to see young unfocused and still inexperienced Romy in the role of Evchen a girl who at last discovers who her father is. What may occur more captivating and more memorable than the debut? The very first time? In her diary Romy herself mentioned her surprising encounter with the medium and generally with the work of an actress a job she had always dreamed of. As a kid she had imagined it differently and the autumn of 1953 brought the reality in full. Having left the boarding school at Goldenstein and the still idyllic Bavaria she was surprised with Cologne with war destruction and the techniques of acting before a camera. Director Deppe reduced the fear in a young actress and helped her handle the performance the note in Romy's diary says that he kept saying 'Don't look at the camera'. But what was perfect for the young girl with unbelievable talent was the role itself she is not a princess from some distant world but a simple girl a daughter of a famous father but with a pack of friends who keep her company. Moreover she plays a very young person whose lines carry resemblance in the actress's real life. Her mum Magda is also her mum in the movie like it is the case with later SISSI Trilogy. And the scenes......there are many sweet scenes that young Rosemarie makes charming and special. The fresh performance with lots of youthful enthusiasm and beauty makes the moments vibrant and lively. She clearly feels comfortable playing with her mother than with other cast but generally she creates a unique atmosphere throughout with the climax of the song being sung together with her famous daddy. Most memorably she utters Himmlisch heavenly while her friend utters 'uebererdisch' unearthly. Therefore if there is a constructive criticism which addresses this movie it surely fails in case of Romy Schneider  she is the ultimate plus of this film. Magda Schneider as Therese Forster crafts her 1930s scenes that recall a pleasant comedy EVA 1935 in particular. The scene when her husband is singing his dedication to her is a clear reference to the appealing style that the viewers of the time were used to. Ms Schneider is unforgettable in the scene when a very special song is being played on the radio the song that gives an answer to her dilemmas. Also her meaningful tears in the theater and visual attention being caught remain a unique impact of a classical actress on her audience... Willy Fritsch is adequate in the role but not outstanding. It is hard to play a famous person whose attention in a long run is stolen by the younger and more attractive. Besides the script itself makes it difficult for the actor to feel at ease. Among the supporting cast Paul Klinger's role of uncle Peter deserves attention.Kept in the style of a musical movie it offers some truly musical moments that maintain the charm of the time. The songs are sweet but fit well to the genre. The spots are authentic in particular the ones shot on location at Wiesbaden not so common for Heimatfilme. Besides the images of spring and the title lilacs provide mood which consoled the viewers of the time and symbolically directed their impressions towards hopeful future. And for us now?For us today it is purely a Romy Schneider film more significant 30 years after her death. The very first movie when all white lilacs bloomed for her approaching career.".

Back to topic a nice even risqu story Romy Schneider in her first role stealing every scene from her mother who was a really bad actress. What made me laugh were the Busby Berkeleylike stages where Bill Perry performed contrasted to about 10 rows of enthusiastic extras who looked like sitting in a small schoolhouse audience.

	schema:reviewBody "The 90minute Wenn der weie Flieder wieder blht or When the White Lilacs Bloom Again is a German color and sound film from 1953 so this one is already over 60 years old. It was written by a trio and the director is Hans Deppe a filmmaker who also worked a lot with Heinz Erhardt. But this one we have here falls under the very generic German films from the 1950s that deal with romance and music for the most part and occasionally a bit of drama about fatherhood too. The lead actor is Willy Fritsch a fairly big star in Germany at this point but it was already later in his career approximately the last decade of his filmmaking career had begun. Female lead is Magda Schneider and it becomes obvious here once again that she does not possess half the star power of her daughter Romy. Romy is also the one I am referring to in the title. She was 14 or 15 when this film came out and it was her very first acting role and far from the only occasions where the character she played was the daughter by the character her real mother Magda played. About the plot and story there is not too much to tell. I did not find it very interesting or inspired. And this is also what brings the film down ultimately. If there is a reason to watch this one it is the very young Romy Schneider and Fritsch to a lesser extent. But I do not recommend checking it out. Thumbs down.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE LAW OF DESIRE opened the 1987 Miami Int'l Film Festival. Almodovar and Carmen Maura had already broken through to the American market at this event with WHAT HAVE I DONE TO... a few years earlier. So it was surprising to find them pacing nervously up and down the lobby of the C.Grove Playhouse at THE LAW's North American premiere. They were also in and out of its rest rooms as the sold out audience roared in laughter and applauded the film and I was making an early dash to the postpremiere party at the Viscaya Palace. They were acting just like the neurotic characters they bring to life in this and their other films. They were still insecure and frustrated that their huge popularity and celebrity status in Europe was reduced to a recent almost cult following in the U.S. They needn't have worried. The film confirmed both of these artists along with Antonio Banderas as stars among North American art movie lovers. This achievement would be crowned the following year with the triumph of their next collaboration the Oscarnominated WOMEN ON THE VERGE...  But THE LAW OF DESIRE will be remembered as Almodovar's selfconfessed most personal work and the masterpiece of his earlier career. This film is pure Almodovar before he toned down to more mainstream fare. LAW... resumes the Almodovarian style in all its excesses. It features most of his muses beyond Maura and Banderas Rossy dePalma Bibi Anderssen Eusebio Poncela and the rest. His style as a writerdirector of women goes over the top here as does his predilection with telephones the police drug use cocaine in particular the media dysfunctional families sexual ambiguity the Catholic Church and the city of Madrid. Almodovar fans will note that all the above themes permeate his work. But nowhere are they so well linked and exposed as in this landmark film.".

This achievement would be crowned the following year with the triumph of their next collaboration the Oscarnominated WOMEN ON THE VERGE...  But THE LAW OF DESIRE will be remembered as Almodovar's selfconfessed most personal work and the masterpiece of his earlier career. This film is pure Almodovar before he toned down to more mainstream fare. LAW... resumes the Almodovarian style in all its excesses. It features most of his muses beyond Maura and Banderas Rossy dePalma Bibi Anderssen Eusebio Poncela and the rest. His style as a writerdirector of women goes over the top here as does his predilection with telephones the police drug use cocaine in particular the media dysfunctional families sexual ambiguity the Catholic Church and the city of Madrid. Almodovar fans will note that all the above themes permeate his work. But nowhere are they so well linked and exposed as in this landmark film.";

	schema:reviewBody "You shouldn't believe everything you read on video boxes. It is not a riotous comedy it's a deeply moving meditation on desire from physical desire to the highest kinds of love. All of the characters are searching for it and one of the questions raised by the movie is What is it worth? The final scene in which Antonio and Pablo are in the apartment just before Antonio kills himself is the the linchpin of the movie. Love is serious it is not a game and love is worth dying for. That is why Pablo throws the typewriter out the windoweverything he has written hasn't been worth the paper it is written on because it assumes that love is merely a toy. In the final scene when Pablo takes up the dead Antonio in his arms and weeps the visual image is a lamentation like the Renaissance paintings of Mary holding Christ in her arms after he has been brought down from the cross. Of course it is funny too in places but funny in a way that elaborates on and deepens the main theme of the movie What is love worth. What Antonio teaches Pablo is that love is worth everything. What you may have been confused by is the tone of the movie which is operatic. This is not about an investigation of individual character. Like much opera it investigates a deeply feltand confusinghuman emotion. It is one of the great gay movies perhaps the greatest one.".

	schema:reviewBody "In what has now customarily become known as the New Queer Cinema Almodovar's Law of Desire must be seen as a landmark film. Opening with a naked man masturbating and being guided through the motions by the disembodied voice of 'the director' this turns out to be something of a redherring though it does establish that the film's central character is a director Almodovar? and that he is gay. What follows is a teasing Hitchcockain menageatrois murder yarn not mystery in which the homosexuality of the protagonists is very much to the fore and is hardly seen as 'an issue' a major breakthrough in what was a mainstream Spanish movie of its day. Indeed Law of Desire was the film which really established Almodovar internationally and while gaythemed movies were finally making their mark in 1987 few were quite as explicitly erotic or as pleasurably inyourface as this.Its cast was largely made up of what only be described as players from Almodovar's stock company and in a fine cast Antonio Banderas and Carmen Maura are the standouts he as a pathologically disturbed 'fan' whose obsession with Eusebio Puncela's director leads to murder and she as the director's transsexual 'sister' a deliriously giddy performance and yet played mostly 'straight' by Maura.If not quite as deep as Almodovar's later movies there is nevertheless much to enjoy here and although dealing with tragic issues Almodovar teases out the black comedy for all its worth. Now of course a great deal of the fun is in slotting the film into the Almodovar canon and seeing exactly where it fits in relation to the movies that followed it.".

The best thing about the movie is the directioneven when the story bogs down in spots there's always something to look at on screen.

	schema:reviewBody "Offbeat and sensitive melodramaThriller about extreme passions  Amor Fou and a killer on lam  being well acted and directed . Good film including interesting drama  colorful cinematography  sensitive score and fine acting by allSpanishstarcast . Almodovar successful thrillerdrama  including his ordinary rare characters  twisted situations and eccentric events dealing with a writerdirector gay and the men who love him  this sexual disorientation jeopardizes his latest project . As it concerns about a couple of siblings  Pablo and Tina  both of whom have complicated sexual existences . Pablo is homosexual and deeply in love with Juan Micky Molina  a young man who won't reply to Pablo's affection . Pablo's brother Tina Carmen Maura is a transsexual  angry at men  raising Ada Manuela Velasco  and attempting to make it as a player . Pablo takes up with Antonio Antonio Banderas  Antonio seeks out Juan  and violence leads to Pablo's grief . Then  it takes place a car crash and Pablo temporarily loss of memory . When memory returns  he learns a dark secret . In horror  Pablo takes on a terrible and disgusting finale .Enjoyable film full of feeling  rare characters plenty of desire and love  haunting moodpieces  emotive as well as outrageous images  and sense of style . The picture deals with offthewallintense drama  family absurdities  superb scenes  a haunting meditation on love with dysfunctional roles and many other things . Here deals with existences of the three peculiar roles  a filmmaker  his angry lover and a transsexual whose fates will flow in all directions  past  present and future  dragging all of them towards an unsuspected finale . This strange as well as excessive melodramatrillerintrigue movie in Douglas Sirk style could only have been made by Almodovar . The picture is acceptable but turns out to be inferior to his subsequent entries such as or Live flesh  The flower of my secret  High heels  Atame  All about my mother Talk to her  all of them strong and outlandish dramas . The result is undiluted scabrous flick  filled with crazy strings of plots and sharp images with thrilling situations . As usual  in the most from Almodvar films  he uses LatinAmerican songs in his movies movies  from Rancheras  Boleros to tangos through Mexican and Cuban boleros  Pedro has a great musical taste . Unforgettable scenes when there takes place a peculiar shower  this iconic hose scene was shot twice  the first one wasn't useful because the pressure was so big that Carmen Maura fell down . The second time the scene was shot perfectly but Maura had to dub herself because of the water noise . The best images happen on the ending of the movie when Tina and Ada are kidnapped and Pablo hurries to Tina's rescue and must face a murderer on loose . Nice actors give awesome interpretations as Eusebio Poncela playing a stressed writer unsettled by a triangular love story  and Antonio Banderas as a youth who becomes jealous of Pablo's love for Juan  the latter well performed by Miguel Molina . I liked everyone in the excellent cast  and the male and female actors  especially Carmen Maura  were all very attractive . Furthermore  a notorious support cast such as Helga Line  Nacho Martnez  Germn Cobos  Bibiana Fernndez and other delightfully played roles . And Fernando Guilln as Police inspector and his assistant played by Fernando Guilln Cuervo are father and son both in movie and in real life . In addition  a lot of cameos with frequent Pedro Almodvar actors appear briefly such as Rossy De Palma  Marta Fernndez Muro and Victoria Abril . As usual in most of Pedro's movies  there is a small role for Agustn Almodvar his brother and producer of the film who plays a lawyer and the same Pedro Almodvar as a shopkeeper . Rousing musical score including some marvelous songs  these are the followings  No Me Quitte Pas written by Jacques Brel  performed by Maysa Matarazzo  Los Panchos  Lo Dudo 'I doubt it'  'If you go away' with the sweet voice of Emiliana Torrini  Guardo Che Luna composed by G. Malgoni . Pedro chooses this kind of songs  Rancheras  Boleros tangos  etc. have something in common  They are about tragedies  lost love  betrayal  desire  lust  hate and passion . Colorful and luxurious cinematography by Angel Fernandez who photographed Almodvar's first films as Dark Habits  What Have I Done to Deserve This? and Matador. This oneofakind picture was realized in his particular style by Pedro Almodovar  he often uses symbolism and metaphorical techniques to portray circular story lines though here he directs a special melodrama  including his ordinary touches . Almodovar directs throughout with splendid zip and he usually portrays strong female characters and transsexuals and along his career getting some important international prizes . His first feature film Pepi Luci Bom 1980 was made in 16 mm and blownup to 35 mm for public release . In 1987 he and his brother Agustn Almodvar established their own production company  El Deseo S. A. The Almodvar phenomenon has reached all over the world  making his films very popular in many countries . Oscarwinning Spanish director Pedro Almodovar who made successes such as Labyrinth of passions  Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown  Bad education  Broken embraces  The Skin I Live In  Volver and many others . The latest from acclaimed Spanish director  Pedro Almodovar's I'm So Excited  a mediocre comedy.".

As usual in most of Pedro's movies  there is a small role for Agustn Almodvar his brother and producer of the film who plays a lawyer and the same Pedro Almodvar as a shopkeeper . Rousing musical score including some marvelous songs  these are the followings  No Me Quitte Pas written by Jacques Brel  performed by Maysa Matarazzo  Los Panchos  Lo Dudo 'I doubt it'  'If you go away' with the sweet voice of Emiliana Torrini  Guardo Che Luna composed by G. Malgoni . Pedro chooses this kind of songs  Rancheras  Boleros tangos  etc. have something in common  They are about tragedies  lost love  betrayal  desire  lust  hate and passion . Colorful and luxurious cinematography by Angel Fernandez who photographed Almodvar's first films as Dark Habits  What Have I Done to Deserve This? and Matador. This oneofakind picture was realized in his particular style by Pedro Almodovar  he often uses symbolism and metaphorical techniques to portray circular story lines though here he directs a special melodrama  including his ordinary touches . Almodovar directs throughout with splendid zip and he usually portrays strong female characters and transsexuals and along his career getting some important international prizes . His first feature film Pepi Luci Bom 1980 was made in 16 mm and blownup to 35 mm for public release . In 1987 he and his brother Agustn Almodvar established their own production company  El Deseo S. A. The Almodvar phenomenon has reached all over the world  making his films very popular in many countries . Oscarwinning Spanish director Pedro Almodovar who made successes such as Labyrinth of passions  Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown  Bad education  Broken embraces  The Skin I Live In  Volver and many others . The latest from acclaimed Spanish director  Pedro Almodovar's I'm So Excited  a mediocre comedy.";

It was put forward by the authorities as the movie to represent the country in 1987. Bearing in mind that Spain had only come out of a fascist dictatorship not much more than a decade earlier this simple fact is a testament to how far the country had moved on in such a short period of time. The reason for this is that this is an unashamedly gay themed film one that celebrates homosexuality and depicts it without issue.The film itself is about a love triangle between three men. Like several other Pedro Almodvar films it's a melodrama with thriller elements. It features an extremely daring performance by Antonio Banderas in a role where he is required to perform in some fullon gay love scenes. These moments made the film front page news in Spain but it did nothing to stop Banderas subsequent rise to stardom. For me however this is a middling movie. It's not amongst the director's best.

	schema:headline " An excellent multilayered thriller Almodvar at his best";
	schema:reviewBody "This reminded me of a less explicitexperimental take on the territory of Julio Medem's great film Sex and Lucia 2001. As with that particular work The Law of Desire 1987 is about the idea of writing and how the boundaries between the film that we are watching and the ideas expressed by the characters therein inevitably intersect one another creating a fold in the narrative where the real and the imagined become one persistent paradox that the audience must eventually decipher. It's an intelligent idea and one that is established right from the very first scene of the film as Almodvar offers us a provocative scenario in which a rent boy strips and masturbates for an unseen client who coaxes him via offscreen dictations. Eventually the scene is revealed to be part of a film within the film written and directed by the lead character Pablo Quintero as well as establishing a number of themes such as power obsession love and manipulation that will continue throughout the rest of the film.Critical opinion would seem to be mixed but for me this was and is an excellent piece of work brimming with the filmmaker's typically spirited direction likablecharismatic characters and bold flourishes of production design colour composition and overall miseenscene. All of these factors would be enough to mark out a recommendation on their own terms however the presentation of the narrative and the way that Almodvar manages to weave the various strands of the storyline together so as to remain constant and yet open to interpretation is really very special as the film freely mixes elements of romantic drama farce detective fiction and a skillful comment on the nature of film and filmmaking into a beguiling and really quite engaging final form. Some have already mentioned the similarities to Adrian Lyne's film Fatal Attraction 1987 produced at the same time however whereas that film felt obvious and moralistic Law of Desire is alluring and erotic even when we can ultimately recognise that the intentions of the characters are misguided and their actions morally wrong.The subtle notion that Pablo is writing the film as we see it rather than having it unfold naturally as a purely Hitchcockian tale of warped obsession is a fascinating idea and ties together the importance of Pablo's typewriter and how the eventual destruction of it and his retirement from writing signals the eventual end of the film. Again also foreshadowing elements of Medem's subsequent film there is the importance of the picture postcard and how it spurs Pablo to rewrite the story of his unrequited love and the mythical importance of the beach side paradise with its lighthouse standing as the ultimate phallic representation. There's also the idea of amnesia in which we can see the definitive desire for Pablo to completely rewrite the actions of the film using the confessional autobiographical nature of his own script to create a more exciting parallel to his own loveless existence. Nevertheless you don't have to read so deeply into these various thematic elements to enjoy the film with the concept still functioning as a conventional thriller that works as a result of the skillful direction of Almodvar and the subtly affecting power of the script.The film should also be commended for its suitably complex and sensitive portrayal of homosexual sex and gay relationships adding something to the erotic and freewheeling tone of the film whilst also feeling true to the characters and the world that they inhabit. It also gives a certain dramatic weight to this truly excellent story of forbidden love pushed to the very extremes and tied to a collection of characters that  although deeply flawed and highly complex  are interesting enough to carry the burden of the director's expansive metatextual ideas. Unlike certain other films that have dealt with the same king of subject matter The Law of Desire works because the characters are believable and the commitment of the performances in particular from Eusebio Poncela as the filmmaker Pablo a standin for Almodvar himself perhaps? and Antonio Banderas as his volatile and enigmatic young lover really push the film into more emotionally affecting territory rare for the usually fun and frivolous tone of the Almodvar of this period.".

Unlike certain other films that have dealt with the same king of subject matter The Law of Desire works because the characters are believable and the commitment of the performances in particular from Eusebio Poncela as the filmmaker Pablo a standin for Almodvar himself perhaps? and Antonio Banderas as his volatile and enigmatic young lover really push the film into more emotionally affecting territory rare for the usually fun and frivolous tone of the Almodvar of this period.";

And now after seeing this film I don't blame them.I watched this film originally expecting a thriller. It has some thriller elements in it especially towards the end but the main plot  a gay film director pursued by a psychopath  is often overshadowed by the quite inappropriate story of the director's sister and her struggle to raise an exlover's daughter.You can see here a young Antonio Banderas as the 'baddie' of this film. Apparantely this was the first film where Antonio performs very hot sex scenes with another male actor.So is the film good? Yes... only if you're a fan of any of the cast or of the director or of dark kinky Spainish films in general. What are the flaws?... well there aren't any that I can pick out. It's a decent film with decent directing. Nothing to get too excited over.Perfect to watch on a quiet Saturday night.".

I think the girl that did Simone could really take some more acting courses but it's only a small role and Karine Vanasse also is not as superb as some said. I even found it difficult at some moments to understand what emotions she was trying to project.The music was beautiful and the scenery magnificent!I'd like to comment some of the actors performance Lebeau was great Seraphin really made me sick and it was the kind of performance that after in each movie I see the guy I see Seraphin his greatest role like when you see Audrey Tautou and you think Amlie!. Roy Dupuis's performance was better in this movie than in any one I saw before he did quite a good job for once. Also some characters like the one Benoit Briere incarnates and also the priest were very convincing. And finally I believe if Vanasse works a bit more she'll end up being a quite good actress hey she's very young so she has time to learn.The ending scene with the doublemeaning scream of Seraphin C'est mo qui brle!!! also brings a lot of emotion and some depth.".

I even found it difficult at some moments to understand what emotions she was trying to project.The music was beautiful and the scenery magnificent!I'd like to comment some of the actors performance Lebeau was great Seraphin really made me sick and it was the kind of performance that after in each movie I see the guy I see Seraphin his greatest role like when you see Audrey Tautou and you think Amlie!. Roy Dupuis's performance was better in this movie than in any one I saw before he did quite a good job for once. Also some characters like the one Benoit Briere incarnates and also the priest were very convincing. And finally I believe if Vanasse works a bit more she'll end up being a quite good actress hey she's very young so she has time to learn.The ending scene with the doublemeaning scream of Seraphin C'est mo qui brle!!! also brings a lot of emotion and some depth.";

With her GREAT actingprobably the best one ever done in a FrenchCanadian film or even EVER she simply brings us to tear. She has the power to take your heart and tear it. I'm a guy it is a huge accomplishment. hehe When I left the teather I felt like this story happened in front of my eyes. The wonderful job of the crew team gives us a strong impression of reality which helps to touch us. On the other hand they make a great job too with including humor to remind us that were watching a movie. They do that exactly when it is so touching that you have no control on your feelings so it helps to regain control of yourself. Pierre Lebeau did an amazing job as Sraphin we hate this man to the point that we want him to die so Alexis and Donalda can live their beautiful love story. There's no clich in this movie. Unlike in Les dangereux we did not wanted to do exactly like the american movies we wanted to create a believable 1890 period of time which would represents the FrenchCanadians.I give 9.5 out of 10 to this movie because a movie can't be 100 perfect! But it's close to be perfect! Everyone in the world should see this touching love story that goes directly to our heart. I hope that more people on this website will see this movie because it is a FrenchCanadian classic!".

	schema:reviewBody "The review on the DVD proclaimed that this film was Quebec's Titanic. That was about right a film using sentimentality and a historical setting to distract from a weak plot and wooden characters.The premise of the film is that pre1960s Quebec was a miserable oppressive place where the Church and the wealthy controlled the peasants like some sort of Catholic Iran this allows the wealthy bad guy to brtualize the poor hero and heroine with impunity. No doubt this had some historical accuracy certainly in the minds of Quebec filmmakers but it isn't very interesting to watch the main characters flail about helplessly unable to overcome their lot in life while some bad guy manipulates them.Compare this film to the much better Louis Cyr where a man growing up in the same time period and subject to the same low status overcomes his obstacles and becomes an inspiration for generations.The actors are some of the best that Quebec has but each main character in Seraphin was so unidimensional that it almost felt like a parody. The rich bad guy is obsessed with money to the point where I confused him with Scrooge McDuck  he literally died with gold coins in his hand. The heroic lumberjack is so heroic that at one point he starts cutting wood in doubletime to pay off the rich bad guy. The damsel in distress is so distressed that I had to ask how a human being can reach adulthood without a backbone  the one redeeming feature of Titanic was that the heroine took some control over her situation and tried at the very least to not die something that Karine Vanasse's character wasn't up to attempting.If our cable was working I wouldn't have watched it to the end.".

The series was a laundered version of Un Homme et son Peche sorry no accents on my keyboard which was a brutal novel about avarice. Avarice is one of the seven deadly sins and ClaudeHenri Grignon the author wanted to show this in the context of a rural Quebec setting. FrenchCanada has a  mythology and Seraphin Poudrier the mean and cruel became with the help of RadioCanada Seraphin the miserable and sometimes ok tightwad. Otherwise the series would have become unbearable I mean how can you love a man who deforms his wife's dead body to fit in a cheap coffin??? Grignon worked on the series so it was done with his blessing and as a result FrenchCanada ended up with a sanitized version that became its bestloved series ever. Indeed to this day anyone over 40 will fondly remember the adventures of a group of hard working French Canadians in the colonial era during the late 1890's. They were easily identifiable and very human. Naturally those who did not read the novel were shocked at the baseness of the main character Seraphin Poudrier. JeanPierre Masson's magistral interpretation of his character in the series was nothing short of absolute perfection. Sadly he became so typecast that he died a drunken miserable person who tried to escape this identity with very few actually realizing that he was indeed a firstclass actor.The FrenchCanadian society in Quebec is very selfish in a loving way and will not let its heroes go. Being so insular it will raise its favorites to the highest level but at what cost. Anyway the novel was a classic and must be studied to understand another view of FrenchCanadian rural mores. Today Quebec has become a dreary socialist thirdworld type society and frankly I miss the older more pictoresque place. The present day society antireligious vociferously antiEnglish and very stupid about it double names silly socialism etc.. is not to my liking. Oh well...".

Although the series was originally sponsored by the German TV group the original heimat 1 and 2 did not fit into typical programming slots. Heimat 3 production came under pressure to confirm more into regular TV slots as German TV is becoming more Americanized and working on more similar schedules than they have in the past. The series was more than I had ever expectedand are a beautiful tribute to artistry and talents of the filmmaker Edgar Rietz. If you have seen Heimat 1 or 2 you will definitely want to see 3 but each part of 3 is a film in itself a work of art that is enjoyable on it's own. The acting photography and story line are all excellent and I am sure he will win many awards. This film will only reinforce the feelings you have about the quality of film that comes from Edgar Rietz. It is a must. For Heimat fans the photo book that has been published to coincide with the release of Heimat 3 will also be a must too and is well worth the investment for real fans. They will not be disappointed as they will not be disappointed with Heimat 3.".

It may have to do with the fact that covering a tenyear period 19891999 in only six episodes isn't an easy task. There are huge chronological gaps between events meaning that after the superbly executed first episode the series'quality shifts some people mostly those the audience will relate to like Russian immigrant Galina or East Berlinbased construction worker Gunnar disappear inexplicably while others come out of nowhere. The characters we're left with are largely annoying Anton's son Hartmut and particularly Hermann's daughter Lulu and it looks like the director's lost his interest in the leading couple as well except for the eerie Kubrickinspired concert sequences. Fortunately he redeems himself with the stunning final chapter aptly titled Farewell to Schabbach a touching and in pure Heimat tradition ambiguous goodbye to a universe that has struck and moved lovers of film and television alike throughout the years.On the whole an underachievement compared to Heimat 1 and 2 blame the dodgy middle section for that but worth seeing as a completion of Reitz's powerful German saga.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some trivia with Heimat probably the most ambitious project in postwar German film history Edgar Reitz became one of Stanley Kubrick's favourite film directors. As Kubrick was fond of both scope and minutiae it comes as no surprise that the attention to detail and the amazing narrative breadth of Reitz's almost 1000 minute long film roused Kubrick's admiration. He saw all of it in his private movie theatre and hung his favourite film still from the film of Maria's coffin on the rainy street in Schabbach over his office desk. Kubrick even contacted Reitz in the 80s to ask him about his set designer Franz Bauer whom he considered for Aryan Papers Kubrick's unmade Holocaust project.When years later Kubrick had finished the filming of Eyes Wide Shut he expressed the wish that all dubbed versions of his film in the most important European countries be supervised by his favourite film directors in France by Patrice Chareau in Spain by Carlos Saura in Italy by Bernardo Bertolucci and in Germany by Edgar Reitz. At that time Reitz was busy preparing Heimat 3 yet after Kubrick's untimely death he bent to Kubrick's wishes.The final Heimat film was released several years after Kubrick's death. With its release and a now combined length of 53 hours and 25 minutes the trilogy became one of the longest series of feature length films in the history of cinema.The first Heimat film subtitled A Chronicle of Germany takes the form of a family saga set in the fictional South Western village of Schabbach in the years prior to World War 2. The film traces the lives of families farmers mayors tradesmen shop owners politicians and soldiers but primarily focuses on the fortunes of the Simon clan who pull themselves out of the humiliating defeat of World War 1 and witness the rise of Hitler and the entry of their country not only into the Second World War but Germany's postwar economic boom.Being a backwater town Germany's conflicts and larger historical events are only glimpsed in fragments by the villagers. The gossip of neighbours messages on radios the appearance of Nazi armbands allusions to the Final Solution and a subtle scene in which a boy on a bicycle observes a concentration camp being constructed all hint at unseen horrors.The film is largely shot in black and white though colour sequences do increasingly pop up most notably during Germany's first colour television broadcast which our humble villagers witness with great fascination. Spielberg would borrow similar techniques in Schindler's List.Heimat 2 and Heimat 3 are equally epic. While Heimat 1 moves from the small town life of 1919 to the social unrest of the 60s and 70s and finally to the relative stability of the 1980s Heimat 2 largely takes place in the late 60s and 70s whilst Heimat 3 centres on the late 80s and 90s and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Unsurprisingly Heimat 3 focuses on a composerconductor rebuilding a dream house whilst the Berlin Wall comes crumbling down a gesture which epitomises the overriding theme of the entire trilogy. With the word Heimat meaning homeland and with the trilogy packed with shots of abandoned factories discarded US bases apartments and crumbling walls the chapters and the final episodes in particular are all about collapse abandonment and rebuilding Reitz primarily concerned with the idea of rebuilding homes and reclaiming Germany and the German identity from nationalistic ideology and later the threats of Globalization.What's most interesting about the trilogy though is watching how the Simon clan changes over the decades humble villagers becoming industrialists aviators arrogant playboys etc. Unsurprisingly these characters are also used as entry points into other topics like one character's narrative symbolising an influx of Russian immigrants another the effects on reunification on East Germany and others the effects of Western capitalism on German heritage.Like The Wire the Heimat trilogy is ultimately one of those rare projects which captures the scope of Balzac and Dickens. It serves up the vast universes expected of great 19th century novels with its Balzaclike focuses on inheritance complex character juggling money flow boardroom dealings and the way the world changes and stays the same with time. Where the Heimat trilogy differs from such fare though is in its mythical scope Reitz paying attention not only to his characters but the very heartbeat of the earth. For all the drama on display he is always inserting moments where natural phenomena earthquares storms eclipses utterly dwarf his cast lending the series a unique tone a strange blend of realism documentary social comedy melodrama mysticism and German Romanticism.9.510  Heimat 18.910  Heimat 2 Heimat 3A work of extraordinary ambition. Heimat 1 and Heimat 2 are the best of the trilogy though the scope of 2 necessitates that its themes be handled in a somewhat superficial manner notice the lack of minorities etc. Heimat 3 ends strongly but is hampered by its short length.".

For all the drama on display he is always inserting moments where natural phenomena earthquares storms eclipses utterly dwarf his cast lending the series a unique tone a strange blend of realism documentary social comedy melodrama mysticism and German Romanticism.9.510  Heimat 18.910  Heimat 2 Heimat 3A work of extraordinary ambition. Heimat 1 and Heimat 2 are the best of the trilogy though the scope of 2 necessitates that its themes be handled in a somewhat superficial manner notice the lack of minorities etc. Heimat 3 ends strongly but is hampered by its short length.";

It is of course excellent cinema perhaps there is no need to explain why considering it's fame. I have one major criticism of the director's vision The whole work is cleansed of minorities.I began to find this troubling about 23s of the way through Heimat 2. It struck me as an outrage that the bohemian salon  it's circle of bright young things in Munich in which Herman lived whilst a student was completely devoid of any gay representation. Unthinkable considering it's exactly the sort of situation in which gay people would have been welcomed  to which they would have gravitated. I found this absence unforgivable by the end of Heimat 2. I got annoyed by the repeated variations of heterosexual love that were being depicted.There was a great injustice in this exclusion. I felt the same in Heimat 3 about ethnic minorities. Here the film moves firmly into the familiar contemporary life of big cities. Berlin is a city of ethnic variation. As the film's main theme came to the fore like a great wave namely the aim to reclaim back from fascism the right of Germans to consider what it means to be German and to celebrate that relationship of people to place the absence of racial representation struck me as inherently suspect even sinister. There were 2 very very brief images of black Americans as iconic emblems of 'other' of 'not us' therefore acceptable even exotic liberating. There was also a very brief image of a group of Indian boys silently working in a sweat shop. This last image is suspect because Germans traditionally envied the idea of Britain's colonial empire  this image evokes a German simulation of a Raj they never had. At the very least the image feeds into the existence of that National envy. White ethnicity is covered. The proximity to the former USSR  former Eastern Europe provides characters who show us this European condition of multiple boundaries  how they contribute to ideas of national identity. But somehow it still portrays a localised preoccupation with notions of racial purity  belonging. That kind of thinking which is fundamentally blind to 'difference' is a cul de sac. I felt the director was somehow giving permission to think like this over  above questioning thinking of this kind. All the people who are given place in the story are essentially good people. They are liberal kind intelligent angry feeling people. But they are all white  heterosexual  the patriarchal flows through their lives. Even the revolution of the sixties depicted the fury of the establishment liberal but failed to portray any minority. I found this unacceptable. It's the one tremendous flaw in this work  for me these absences are as huge as the trilogy itself. It distorts reality and raises questions about subliminal fascism in what the director selects when posing this very big idea. Is the frustration of the Liberal German really it's failure to abandon a mental homeland that consists of traditional heterosexual whiteness ?".

At the time the film was released the idea of revealing who the killer was in the opening scene was virtually unheard of but it ended up being very effective because it allowed the audience to concentrate more on other elements of the film which was the goal of Billy Wilder the director. Instead of trying to figure out who the perpetrator was there is more emphasis on how the crime was pulled off what mistakes were made during the murder who betrayed who how close Barton Keyes the insurance investigator was getting to solving the case and probably most importantly what kind of person Walter Neff is and whether or not sympathy should be felt toward him.Barbara Stanwyck in one of the most remembered performances of her extensive career represents with nearly flawless ease the cold and ruthless manipulator who has no difficulty in ruining other people's lives in various ways including death if necessary in order to get what she wants. Known in the film community as the femme fatale' this is someone who uses her sexual prowess seductiveness and emotional detachment to drag an unsuspecting person generally an interested man into a scheme from which she is expected to benefit heavily and he is most likely headed for destruction. In these types of films the man often either finds his life in ruins or ends up dead as is often but not always also the case with the fate of the femme fatale. Barbara Stanwyck as Phyllis Dietrichson the murderous femme fatale in Double Indemnity and Fred MacMurray as Walter Neff her victim' have amazing chemistry on screen. Their attraction is incredibly well portrayed and the development of their relationship with each other is so convincing that what happens between them almost seems normal. Besides that their mutually calculated interaction although it seems at first like it has been rehearsed endlessly and ultimately brought unconvincingly to the screen is exactly as it was meant to be because it represents each character's intentions even very subtly foreshadowing their future betrayals against each other. Phyllis has gone through every word she ever says to Walter in her head. She has practiced what she wants to say when she brings up the idea of life insurance to Walter in the beginning and she knows what she wants to say whenever they interact with each other because she has been planning for quite some time the prospect of murdering her husband in order to collect his fortune. Walter conversely methodically makes amorous advances as though this is something that he does regularly and then ultimately he also plans out his conversations with Phyllis because he begins to suspect her and is sure to tell her only what he wants her to hear. This seemingly stiff dialogue brilliantly represents Phyllis and Walter's precise and sinister intentions and it's quick pace creates a feeling of urgency and restlessness.Probably the most fascinating and entertaining actor in the film Edward G. Robinson plays Barton Keyes Walter's friend and employer at the insurance company where he works. Keyes is a very suspicious man who closely investigates the insurance claims which come into the company having a striking history of accurately isolating fraudulent claims and throwing them out. His handling of Phyllis's and Walter's technically claim and the way that he gets closer and closer to the truth create a great atmosphere of tension and drama. Double Indemnity is nearly flawless. From the shocking and unexpected beginning to the already known but still surprising end the audience is held rapt by the excellent performances the brilliant and imaginative direction and the flawlessly created atmosphere. This is excellent excellent filmmaking and is a classic film that should not be missed.".

This is one of the rare times when the movie was far better than the book. That's not a shock after you find out that literary giant Raymond Chandler and Hall Of Fame director Billy Wilder combined to write the screenplayFor a murdersuspense story there is very little action almost none yet there are no boring lulls. The three main actors  Stanwyck MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson are what make this so good.MacMurray's narration is fun to hear as he tells the story in flashback from the beginning by dictating into an old Dictaphone to his coworker Robinson. The latter is almost mesmerizing in his performance the way he delivers his lines. He can even make a speech about something as boring as insurance and still keep you riveted to the screen.Stanwyck was no sex symbol at least to me but she looked great here in the most seductive of 1940s clothing and like Robinson has a distinctive voice and accent that keeps your attention.This film was the inspiration for the 1980 movie Body Heat starring William Hurt and Kathleen Turner. That too was a very very good movie....but not many films are in the class of this one.".

	schema:headline " Some times when they least expect it.....";
	schema:reviewBody "There are occasional times when all the elements come together to make a great film that will stand the passing of time. Double Indemnity seems to be an example of this phenomenon.First there was a great novel by one of America's best mystery writers James Cain who created these characters that seem will live forever in our imagination. Then the lucky break in getting the right man to direct it Billy Wilder a man who knew about how to make a classic out of the material that he adapted with great care and elegance with Raymond Chandler a man who knew about the genre.Double Indemnity works because it's a story we can relate to. There is a greedy woman trapped in a bad marriage who sees the opportunity when she encounters an insurance agent who is instantly smitten with her and who has only sex in his mind. The manipulator Phyllis Dietrichson doesn't need much to see how Walter desires her. His idea of having her husband sign an insurance policy he knows nothing about thinking he is doing something else will prove a fatal flaw in judgment.Mr. Wilder achieves in this film what others try with disastrous results. The director who was working under the old Hays Code shows so much sex in the film with fully clothed actors yet one feels the heat exuding from the passion Walter Neff feels for Phyllis. He is a man that will throw everything away because he is blinded by the promise of what his life will be once the husband is out of the picture.In life as well as in fiction there are small and insignificant things that will derail the best laid plans. First there i Jackson the man who shouldn't have been smoking at the rear of the train contemplating the passing landscape. Then no one counts in the ability of Barton Keys the man in the agency who has seen it all! Walter and Phyllis didn't take that into consideration and it will backfire on their plan.We try to make a point to take a look at Double Indemnity when it shows on cable from time to time. Barbara Stanwyck makes a magnificent Phyllis. There are no false movements in her performance. Phyllis gets under Walter's skin because she knows where her priorities lie and makes good use of them in order to render Walter helpless under her spell.Fred McMurray makes a perfect Walter. He is consumed by his passion and he will do anything because of what he perceives will be the reward for doing the crime. Walter Neff was perhaps Mr. McMurray's best creation. He is completely believable and vulnerable.Edgar G. Robinson as Barton Keys makes one of his best performances for the screen. Keys is a man that has seen all the schemes pass by his desk. He is in a way Walter's worst nightmare because working next to Keys he gets to know how wrong he was in the planning of the crime.The supporting cast is excellent. Porter Hall Jean Heather Tom Powers Richard Gaines Fortunio Buonanova and John Philliber are perfect.The music score of Miklos Rosza gives the film a texture and a dimension that capitalizes on the action it intends to enhance. Also the music of Cesar Franck and Franz Schubert contribute to the atmosphere of the movie. The great cinematography of John Seitz who will go on to direct films is another asset in the movie. Edith Head's costumes are absolutely what a woman like Phyllis would wear right down to her ankle bracelet.This film shows a great man at his best Billy Wilder!".

Then the lucky break in getting the right man to direct it Billy Wilder a man who knew about how to make a classic out of the material that he adapted with great care and elegance with Raymond Chandler a man who knew about the genre.Double Indemnity works because it's a story we can relate to. There is a greedy woman trapped in a bad marriage who sees the opportunity when she encounters an insurance agent who is instantly smitten with her and who has only sex in his mind. The manipulator Phyllis Dietrichson doesn't need much to see how Walter desires her. His idea of having her husband sign an insurance policy he knows nothing about thinking he is doing something else will prove a fatal flaw in judgment.Mr. Wilder achieves in this film what others try with disastrous results. The director who was working under the old Hays Code shows so much sex in the film with fully clothed actors yet one feels the heat exuding from the passion Walter Neff feels for Phyllis. He is a man that will throw everything away because he is blinded by the promise of what his life will be once the husband is out of the picture.In life as well as in fiction there are small and insignificant things that will derail the best laid plans. First there i Jackson the man who shouldn't have been smoking at the rear of the train contemplating the passing landscape. Then no one counts in the ability of Barton Keys the man in the agency who has seen it all! Walter and Phyllis didn't take that into consideration and it will backfire on their plan.We try to make a point to take a look at Double Indemnity when it shows on cable from time to time. Barbara Stanwyck makes a magnificent Phyllis. There are no false movements in her performance. Phyllis gets under Walter's skin because she knows where her priorities lie and makes good use of them in order to render Walter helpless under her spell.Fred McMurray makes a perfect Walter. He is consumed by his passion and he will do anything because of what he perceives will be the reward for doing the crime. Walter Neff was perhaps Mr. McMurray's best creation. He is completely believable and vulnerable.Edgar G. Robinson as Barton Keys makes one of his best performances for the screen. Keys is a man that has seen all the schemes pass by his desk. He is in a way Walter's worst nightmare because working next to Keys he gets to know how wrong he was in the planning of the crime.The supporting cast is excellent. Porter Hall Jean Heather Tom Powers Richard Gaines Fortunio Buonanova and John Philliber are perfect.The music score of Miklos Rosza gives the film a texture and a dimension that capitalizes on the action it intends to enhance. Also the music of Cesar Franck and Franz Schubert contribute to the atmosphere of the movie. The great cinematography of John Seitz who will go on to direct films is another asset in the movie. Edith Head's costumes are absolutely what a woman like Phyllis would wear right down to her ankle bracelet.This film shows a great man at his best Billy Wilder!";

The screenplay itself is a work of art in its charater construction plot structure and dialogue which is delievered by an ensemble of first class actors divying up first class performances. Barbra Stanwyck as the deadly smouldering scheming Phyllis Dietrichson turns in a performance that is right up there with Mary Astor's Brigid O'Shaughnessy. Fred McMurray delievers a performance of a smart but desperately lovelorn patsy and Edward G. Robinson is perfect in the role of Barton Keyes and just about steals the moment every time he appears on screen.I personally love a good Noir film and this is right up there with the best of them. Billy Wilder should be proud of this work eventhough the Academy didn't see it fit to reward him for his efforts however I personally think this film is an absolute winner.".

	schema:reviewBody "Double Indemnity begins with a car speeding on a dark rainy night.  This begins the classic film noir plot.  Billy Wilder directs a steamy and grabbing film.  Billy Wilder pulls this film together with an awesome cast perfect lighting and an amusing script.  Fred MacMurray plays Walter Neff an unsuspecting insurance salesman.  He is unsuspecting in the sense that he is unaware of what the femme fatale' is going to put him up to.  Barbara Stanwyck plays the femme fatale' Phyllis Dietrichson a manipulative housewife who will stop at nothing to get what she wants.The film begins in present day giving insight into Walter's current plight. Walter Neff gives the voice over as the plot unfolds.  It starts in the present time allowing the audience to know what crime has happened without the interesting details to support it.  This is an interesting twist to the common film noir plot.  Knowing the crime at hand keeps the audience hungry for those details.  Walter is the victim of the beautiful woman who manipulates him into pulling off a murderous insurance fraud scam.  Walter is an impeccable insurance salesman and Phyllis in some ways forces him into providing her with what she needs.  Phyllis is the typical femme fatale' who has no problem in using others to get what she wants.Throughout the film Walter is completely enamored by Phyllis.  Walter could have coined the pet name baby' with his fondness towards Phyllis by calling her that throughout the film.  He is easily distracted by her beauty and evil charm.   He seems to be entranced by Phyllis's ankle bracelet so much that he mentions it numerous times.  This allows the audience to feel the sexual tension between the two.  Phyllis on the other hand shows the audience that she can use and abuse anyone who gets in her way.  While believably attracted to Walter Phyllis keeps him hopping to fulfill her needs.  She pulls him in and handles him like a puppet.  She is the epitome of the film noir genre's femme fatale'.Barton Keyes played by Edward G. Robinson is Walter's coworker and friend at the insurance company where he works.  Barton closely investigates all insurance claims that come across his desk.  While at one time Walter assuredly agreed with this practice once Barton starts to unravel the mystery behind Mrs. Dietrichson's insurance claim we begin to see just how nervous and paranoid Walter is.  Walter then begins to see Phyllis in a whole new light.  Barton plays the integral part by piecing together details that are thrown around throughout the film.  This keeps the tension high for the filmgoer.  These details are pieced together perfectly through to the end.Double Indemnity has the perfect plot with the perfect cast.  Walter and Phyllis' attraction are tasty and the crime is wonderfully puzzling. Double Indemnity is the true film noir giant.".

	schema:headline " Absorbing and worthy suspense film about blackmails  killing  corruption and strong intrigue";
	schema:reviewBody "Vintage Noir Film with gritty interpretation  atmospheric settings  crackling dialogue throughout and powerhouse filmmaking . This Billy Wilder's first thriller is one of the finest Noir film ever made . A scheming wife Barbara Stanwyck lures an insurance salesman Fred MacMurray  though Alan Ladd George Raft Brian Donlevy James Cagney Spencer Tracy Gregory Peck and Fredric March were all up for the leading role into helping murder her husband and then declare it an accident . Both of whom concoct a twisted scheme to collect the benefits of a insurance policy . As the hubby's policy contains a clause that states that if the husband's death caused by a moving train the policy pays double face value . The investigator's boss Edward G. Robinson  not knowing his colleague is involved in it  suspects murder and sets out to prove it .This firstrate and entertaining American classic Noir film draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as drama  emotion and moody atmosphere . This classic mystery thriller follows James M Cain's book fairly closely otherwise . Twisted film Noir about murder  troubled relationships  treason  dark secrets  including an unforgettable dialog  being based on the James M Cain's novel  which in turn was based on the true story of Ruth Snyder the subject of a notorious 1920s murder trial  being screenwritten by the prestigious Raymond Chandler and the same Billy Wilder . However  Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler did not get along well while writing this film's script a process that was apparently filled with arguments . As Billy Wilder didn't really get on with the famous novelist whose constant drinking irritated the director . It packs a good realization  an original script  haunting atmosphere  intriguing events  for that reason madness and murder prevail . Fred MacMurray is superb as insurance salesman coerced into murder plot and Barbara Stanwick as predatory and alluring Femme Fatale is magnificent . Here his colleague Edward G Robinson is extraordinary and as cool as ever  he plays as the astute and stubborn investigator  his scenes with Fred MacMurray are awesome and at their best . But Edward G. Robinson's initial reluctance to sign on largely stemmed from the fact he wasn't keen on being demoted to third lead . Good support cast formed by notorious secondaries such as Porter Hall  Tom Powers  Jean Heather  Byron Barr and Fortunio Bonanova . And Raymond Chandler's cameo  this marks the only film appearance of screenwriter and novelist Raymond Chandler .Exciting as well as complex film  possessing a mysterious and fascinating blend of gripping thriller  serenity  baroque suspense in which especially stands out the portentous performances  evocative cinematography in black and white by John F. Seitz and thrilling musical score by the classic Miklos Rozsa . The motion picture was stunningly directed by the great Billy Wilder  as the American Film Institute ranked this as the 29 Greatest Movie of All Time . The film was nominated for 7 Academy Awards but lost out on the night to Going my way 1944 by Leo McCarey. It got a deep inspiration for other films  it is particularly obvious for Body heat by Lawrence Kasdan with William Hurt  Kathleen Turner and Richard Crenna . Remade for TV in 1954 by Buzz Kulik with Frank Lovejoy  Ray Collins and Laraine Day  and 1973 TV remake of the 1940s classic by Jack Smight with Richard Crenna  Samantha Eggar  and Robert Webber .".

Both of whom concoct a twisted scheme to collect the benefits of a insurance policy . As the hubby's policy contains a clause that states that if the husband's death caused by a moving train the policy pays double face value . The investigator's boss Edward G. Robinson  not knowing his colleague is involved in it  suspects murder and sets out to prove it .This firstrate and entertaining American classic Noir film draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as drama  emotion and moody atmosphere . This classic mystery thriller follows James M Cain's book fairly closely otherwise . Twisted film Noir about murder  troubled relationships  treason  dark secrets  including an unforgettable dialog  being based on the James M Cain's novel  which in turn was based on the true story of Ruth Snyder the subject of a notorious 1920s murder trial  being screenwritten by the prestigious Raymond Chandler and the same Billy Wilder . However  Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler did not get along well while writing this film's script a process that was apparently filled with arguments . As Billy Wilder didn't really get on with the famous novelist whose constant drinking irritated the director . It packs a good realization  an original script  haunting atmosphere  intriguing events  for that reason madness and murder prevail . Fred MacMurray is superb as insurance salesman coerced into murder plot and Barbara Stanwick as predatory and alluring Femme Fatale is magnificent . Here his colleague Edward G Robinson is extraordinary and as cool as ever  he plays as the astute and stubborn investigator  his scenes with Fred MacMurray are awesome and at their best . But Edward G. Robinson's initial reluctance to sign on largely stemmed from the fact he wasn't keen on being demoted to third lead . Good support cast formed by notorious secondaries such as Porter Hall  Tom Powers  Jean Heather  Byron Barr and Fortunio Bonanova . And Raymond Chandler's cameo  this marks the only film appearance of screenwriter and novelist Raymond Chandler .Exciting as well as complex film  possessing a mysterious and fascinating blend of gripping thriller  serenity  baroque suspense in which especially stands out the portentous performances  evocative cinematography in black and white by John F. Seitz and thrilling musical score by the classic Miklos Rozsa . The motion picture was stunningly directed by the great Billy Wilder  as the American Film Institute ranked this as the 29 Greatest Movie of All Time . The film was nominated for 7 Academy Awards but lost out on the night to Going my way 1944 by Leo McCarey. It got a deep inspiration for other films  it is particularly obvious for Body heat by Lawrence Kasdan with William Hurt  Kathleen Turner and Richard Crenna . Remade for TV in 1954 by Buzz Kulik with Frank Lovejoy  Ray Collins and Laraine Day  and 1973 TV remake of the 1940s classic by Jack Smight with Richard Crenna  Samantha Eggar  and Robert Webber .";

Stanwyck set the standard for tough calculating shady women who exploit men without shame or remorse and her masterful manipulation of MacMurray is the movie's central theme. The film's imagery is filled with shadows and low lighting accompanied by a tense brooding music score. Stanwyck spins her web of ensnarement like a black widow with her victim seemingly unaware of the danger that enfolds him. MacMurray provides the narrative of the film which is told in flashback and delivers a cryptic account of the events in a confession to a boss who trusted him completely. Robinson is on target as the skeptical and suspicious boss who has a sixth sense about phony insurance claims. A nice supporting cast contributes to this thriller namely Richard Gaines and Porter Hall.".

As Phyllis Dietrichson Barbara Stanwyck descends her California home's spiral staircase we are as enraptured as Neff. And it takes little time to figure out that being enraptured by this femme fatale is a very dangerous position to find oneself in. Is it accidental that the bracelet is worn around her ankle as opposed to the more traditional wrist? Is it accidental that the sunlight streaming through the windows cast shadows not unlike bars across the living room? I suspect it's about as accidental as Mr. Dietrichson Tom Powers eventually ending up dead along the railroad tracks. We must remember that Billy Wilder is doing more than evoking noir here he's inventing it. And how brave he is! Beginning the film by all but divulging the ending is hardly the route most directors choose to go when directing a thriller. But as he's well aware the audience doesn't care half as much about where they end up as they do about the thrill of the ride it takes to get them there. The structure of the film is familiar to anyone who has seen Body Heat or any other knockoff. Double Indemnity is the original however and it's intricate plot revels in its complexities nearly as much as Walter and Phyllis do in their convoluted plot to dispose of an unwanted husband. The audience learns only a minimum about the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Dietrichson but we easily surmise that their union was not out of love. If the marriage was one of convenience than the murder certainly is. It seems unlikely Phyllis is after the freedom to continue her heady tryst with Walter and even the money provided by the double indemnity clause of Mr. Dietrichson's life insurance policy seems more like a bonus than a motivation. In other words Phyllis just wants her husband dead. And Neff obliges. Several times while watching Double Indemnity I felt my pulse physically quicken. These scenes were most notably the ones in which it looked as though Walter and Phyllis' trolley car had finally reached the end of its line and discovery of their crime was inevitable. The scene where Phyllis is forced to hide behind a door knowing that incrimination awaits if the person on the other side sees her is unrelenting in its suspense. After all we want this reprehensible act to go off without a hitch every bit as much as they do. That is the sign of a good film. It also stands to reason seeing as how we were there when the elaborate scheme was being plotted. That makes us accessories. And if they get caught God help us so do we.".

He is a historian a listener a writer and a supreme judge of movies. While I am not going to agree that this is the finest movie ever produced in the U.S. I am still going to say that this is easily one of the very best films ever conceived and executed through the history of motion pictures. An insurance man Fred MacMurray goes to renew an automobile policy for the ridiculously wealthy Tom Powers. Instead of finding his man though he meets Powers' superwicked and highly sexual wife Barbara Stanwyck in an unforgettable Oscarnominated part. They flirt immediately. There is something more than friendship there and a crazed affair starts. Stanwyck a master manipulator tells sob stories to MacMurray about her abusive husband embellishing quite a bit in the process. MacMurray only having eyes for Stanwyck comes up with a plan with her to have Powers killed so they can collect the insurance via the titled policy. Naturally though Stanwyck does not think near as much of the relationship as MacMurray does and the duo must constantly dodge pesky insurance investigator Edward G. Robinson in one of his finer roles and Stanwyck's suspicious stepdaughter Jean Heather. All told through intense flashbacks by MacMurray Double Indemnity is quite possibly cowriterdirector Oscarnominated in both categories Billy Wilder's finest contribution to the cinema. As time passes many film scholars confuse this as one of Alfred Hitchcock's productions. Looking back this is a very odd movie for Wilder considering latter triumphs with movies like Sunset Boulevard Stalag 17 Some Like It Hot and The Apartment. However Wilder would continue a similar trend immediately following this in 1945 with the Best Picture Oscarwinning The Lost Weekend an intense characterstudy of one man's Ray Milland bout with alcoholism. Double Indemnity has nothing wrong with it. I cannot think of one negative throughout the film. I never found Stanwyck very attractive but she has a way about her that makes her deceptively sexy here. MacMurray one of those actors who never got any credit does probably his best work ever in this one and Robinson is his usual dominant scenestealing self. Wickedly brilliant fun to watch dramatic darkly comical superbly written and flawlessly directed Double Indemnity is one of those movies that should be embraced by all fans of the national and international cinema. 5 stars out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers hereinDouble Indemnity is another piece of classic film noir with all the classic elements of mystery plotting femme fatales and snappy dialogue. I just finished watching it and I have to say it's possibly the best I've seen.Not only is it a beautifully and craftily worked noir story but also a complex fable about greed and revenge remorse and regret. From the moment it starts you know it's going to hit you and it certainly does.Fred MacMurray plays insurance salesman Walter Neff who relates the story to us by leaving a memo for his claims manager Keyes played by Edward G Robinson. His intermittent voiceovers take the guise not only of the narrator but also of Neff's conscience as he retells the story of his involvement in the murder of his client Dietrichson after he plotted with Dietrichson's wife. They thought it would be the perfect murder but as Keyes so rightly points out no murder is perfect. It comes undone sooner or later and when there's two people involved usually sooner. Particularly in this case as Mrs Dietrichson and Neff begin to plot against each other. It becomes less about claiming the insurance money and more about which one if either gets away with the murder.As you can tell from my clearly blithering attempt to ruin the plot it's a fantastic film. You come away from it and you want to ruin the ending for someone else because it's just so exciting. Billy Wilder directs with absolute precision he blends perfectly the romance frequent suspense and dramatic irony dispersed throughout the film in absolute drones. The fact that Neff is present in all but one of the scenes in the film is a constant reminder of the irony of the story the fact that he is involved on all sides and in all facets of the plot.Barbara Stanwyck also plays one of the best femme fatales I've ever seen on screen it's not only a masterful performance but a masterful character in itself. The success of this film owes a lot to both her performance and the way the script works her in. Fred MacMurray is occasionally overly winsome at the start of the film however he definitely pulls his performance together at the end and it is not enough to detract entirely from the overall effect.A crafty enjoyable and suspenseful film noir filled with antiheroes mystery morals and just good allround entertainment. Not quite perfect but about as close as it can come. 12  ".

His intermittent voiceovers take the guise not only of the narrator but also of Neff's conscience as he retells the story of his involvement in the murder of his client Dietrichson after he plotted with Dietrichson's wife. They thought it would be the perfect murder but as Keyes so rightly points out no murder is perfect. It comes undone sooner or later and when there's two people involved usually sooner. Particularly in this case as Mrs Dietrichson and Neff begin to plot against each other. It becomes less about claiming the insurance money and more about which one if either gets away with the murder.As you can tell from my clearly blithering attempt to ruin the plot it's a fantastic film. You come away from it and you want to ruin the ending for someone else because it's just so exciting. Billy Wilder directs with absolute precision he blends perfectly the romance frequent suspense and dramatic irony dispersed throughout the film in absolute drones. The fact that Neff is present in all but one of the scenes in the film is a constant reminder of the irony of the story the fact that he is involved on all sides and in all facets of the plot.Barbara Stanwyck also plays one of the best femme fatales I've ever seen on screen it's not only a masterful performance but a masterful character in itself. The success of this film owes a lot to both her performance and the way the script works her in. Fred MacMurray is occasionally overly winsome at the start of the film however he definitely pulls his performance together at the end and it is not enough to detract entirely from the overall effect.A crafty enjoyable and suspenseful film noir filled with antiheroes mystery morals and just good allround entertainment. Not quite perfect but about as close as it can come. 12  ";

The acting is in top form from all of the players.  The cinematography is crisp and beautiful.  The sound is nice and clear and the direction is arguably some of Wilder's best.  However the real star is the screenplay.  First off it was taken from excellent source material.  James Cain is always great for a story where nobody wins out.  Check out The Postman Always Rings Twice for an example.  But it is Chandler who I think really put this one on the map. Chandler has a way with dialogue that makes it all ring in your ears.  The lines are smooth and the characters always say something that makes me wish I could be that clever and smooth in everyday situations.  Chandler knows dialogue Chandler knows LA and Chandler knows how to deliver a story. Check out any of his novels and you will see this.  This is a teamup that I really wish would have happened again.  Oh well.  If you don't mind voice over narration then this is a film for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Double Indemnity is a great movie with many great attributes but foremost among these must be its scintillating screenplay which combines wit intelligence razor sharp remarks and double entendres in such an effective way that as well as being immensely entertaining it also contributes strongly to driving the pace of the story. The quick fire dialogue and superb repartee are so engaging that they command the attention of the audience right from the start and also provide added impetus to all the action that follows. Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler collaborated in adapting James M Cain's story for the movie and the end result was nothing short of brilliant and was understandably nominated for the Academy Award for Best Writing Screenplay in 1945.The characters featured in this evil tale are very memorable and in the case of the two main protagonists are also very immoral. Walter Neff Fred MacMurray is a fast talking insurance salesman who goes to visit a client and in his absence meets his wife Phyllis Dietrichson Barbara Stanwyck. Their first encounter during which Dietrichson appears dressed only in a bath towel leads to some flirting and their relationship develops further when Dietrichson eventually convinces Neff to take part in a scheme to sell her husband an accident policy unknown to Mr Dietrichson and then to murder him so that the couple can collect the insurance money and enjoy a future together.Neff advises that the policy will pay out double if the fatal accident occurs on a train and so when Mr Dietrichson is due to go on a business trip arrangements are made for him to travel by train. Neff carries out the murder and dressed like Mr Dietrichson complete with crutches takes his place on the train journey before the couple place the body on the tracks to give the impression that Mr Dietrichson died as the result of an accidental fall from the observation car of the train.After having carried out their plan successfully the events that follow conspire to introduce a series of complications which lead to the couple losing their trust in each other and also to the movie's dramatic conclusion.Fred MacMurray is perfect in his role as the very self assured Neff who's corrupted by lust and a greed for wealth. His portrayal of someone who thinks he knows all the angles but whose confidence is gradually eroded as things start to go wrong is very convincing and Barbara Stanwyck is also excellent as the cold manipulative seductress who is utterly ruthless and seemingly devoid of any human feelings. Edward G Robinson appears in the role of Barton Keyes a claims investigator who works for the same firm as Neff. Barton is very experienced and incredibly good at his job and possesses a strong instinct which enables him to sense immediately if a claim is likely to be fraudulent. He and Neff enjoy a longstanding friendship which involves a good deal of warmth and mutual respect. Robinson's performance is outstanding as he delivers some superfast speeches and conveys the nature of his character's idiosyncrasies with great panache.In typical film noir style the story is told in flashback with Neff's narration providing a particularly matteroffact account of what happened. When he says I killed him for money and for a woman. I didn't get the money and I didn't get the woman there's an inherent poignancy in his words but the delivery is completely lacking in any sentimentality or self pity. The same can be said for his remark that we did it so that we could be together but it's tearing us apart.Double Indemnity is a dark thriller which became the prototype for many later movies which told similar stories but rarely with the same style and impact as the original. Billy Wilder's direction is superb and especially successful in contributing to the high levels of suspense that are generated at various junctures throughout the action. This is a film of rare quality and one that because of its subject matter will undoubtedly continue to be a source of great entertainment and fascination for movie lovers for many years to come.".

Billy Wilder is an absolute genius his stories always unfolding at the right pace and his way of bringing them to the screen barely ever impeccable.This is the forties cinema. A story of love and betrayal of manipulation and big money. The story of femme fatal Barbra Stanwick luring poor insurance salesman Walter Niff to kill her husband so they can be together. Stanwick has what it takes to make her character look sexually dangerous and desirable. Niff has the ways and traits to make his character look like a stylish fool. But as far as acting is concerned both are surpassed by the wonderful Edward G.

And when it's directed in such a beautiful way it's little wonder that the noir is so loved and remembered. The mise sn scene is beautiful. MacMurray's and Stanwyck's character are never really portrayed close. Even when they kiss they are always shot at an awkward angle. When they are in the same frame Wilder always makes sure that there's something in the way whether it's a mother and a child in a supermarket or a fish tank in the study room of the man whose murder is being secretly plotted. This murder plot reaches its height of tension when MacMurray lures Stanwyck's husband to sign a life insurance as he thinks he is signing an ordinary car one. He is in fact signing his life away.As in too many noirs though it pitfalls into the use of voice over. That is forgiven because from the start we know that he is telling Edward G.

In fact one of the most interesting things about the film is the way we observe the main character and the way that we back him up sometimes only to change our minds other times.

	schema:reviewBody "50 years from now a crew of eight astronauts are heading to our dying sun via the colossal Icarus II spaceship. Having left earth frozen in a solar winter they are humanity's last hope after the failure of the original Icarus mission several years earlier. They are to drop a massive nuclear bomb into the heart of the sun hopefully reigniting the fading star. All of earth's remaining resources were mined to create the bomb so there won't be another shot. Unfortunately minds tend to crack under the most unbearable pressure one could ever imagine.A brilliant film. I will always remember August 8th 2007 as the day when I first saw Sunshine. A most memorable date indeed as I saw what would become second only to Requiem for a Dream on my list of alltime favorite films. Due to the dim bulbs at Fox I had to drive all the way to North Richland Hills to see it but never has going out of my way to see a film been more worth the effort.Danny Boyle's science fiction epic is pure unadulterated tension. I actually became physically uncomfortable sweating tingling the works due to the tension and claustrophobia on display. Not only your typical claustrophobia but claustrophobia of the mind as well. I felt every bit of psychosis loneliness and pressure that the characters felt. To be that far from home for such a long time all cramped up in a ship headed for the searing heat of the sun... I felt that. I rarely feel this way for film characters but here I felt the depth and the seriousness of their situation. I felt sucker punched every time one of them died. The demise of Kaneda was especially effective. The raw emotional reactions from the actors sold it to me big time. It's sort of hard to explain but Sunshine just hammered me in a way that more traditionally disturbing films aren't capable of. This film nails the horrors of psychological exhaustion as flawlessly as any film I've seen.It helps that the cast was uniformly excellent. Each character had their own unique voice and their own unique reaction to the situation at hand. Of the lot Chris Evans really impressed me as Mace. I didn't think he was much of an actor before seeing him in this film. Special mention to my favorite actress Rose Byrne. Her performances never disappoint her charm is unmatched and she possesses a beauty more intense than the sun itself.I have no complaints about the third act. None. I will agree with general consensus that Alex Garland usually goes off the rails towards the end of his screenplays but not here. It was clearly being built up to all throughout the film. Just look at the spiritual awakening that the sun inspires in Searle or the first video message we see from Pinbacker. And yes spirituality is used to fascinating effect adding a deep layer of personal poignancy to the film. One of the key themes of Sunshine after all is man's relationship with the sun itself the source of all life. It also allowed for the creepy aspect of Pinbacker posing the bodies of his victims.Unlike many people I actually loved the filming technique used to shoot Pinbacker. It reminded me of the visible heat waves one often sees rising off of highway asphalt. The introduction of Pinbacker in the observation room by the way is a classic scene. Absolutely classic.This film was the one to push me into the whole HDBluRay thing. I had virtually no desire to upgrade formats but this film was so astonishingly visual it singlehandedly opened me to the idea. I don't know if I've ever seen more beautifully realized visuals than those captured here. Couple that with the booming sound design and I'm so relieved that I managed to catch this theatrically. It was such an experience and I'd like to replicate that experience as closely as possible with each future viewing.Sunshine is a stunning film that I could discuss endlessly. Fox really dropped the ball with promotion and distribution. It deserved so much better in that regard but what's done is done. Now if only the film's equally incredible soundtrack would hit CD in the near future.".

	schema:headline " Sunshine  rather good..";
	schema:reviewBody "Sunshine cost 20 million. Jerry Bruckheimer and his Hollywood cohorts must be shaking their heads in disbelief. Danny Boyle and Alex Garland British born and bred have outdone America's effects laden finest and at a mere fraction of the price. Armageddon 140 million and Pirates of The Caribbean 2 225 million have nothing nothing on the majestic visuals that Sunshine offers. From the jaw dropping opening sequence to the fantastically realised final moments Boyle's latest is a mighty treat for the eyes. But of course effects do not make a film. You need only consider the two aforementioned Bruckheimer blowouts for proof. But happily behind the blinding visuals Sunshine has a violently beating heart. One that offers absolutely no let up that gains speed and then gains a little more before finally threatening cardiac arrest. You can't help but live and breath every moment of the crew's breathless existence. The year is 2057 and a select group of astronauts are given that most trifling of tasks. The sun is dying. Drop a bomb in it. Save all of mankind. And to top it all on a ship rather ominously named 'Icarus II'. Add inevitable inter crewmember tension and you have a rather heated situation. The sweaty crew are played wonderfully by a decidedly unstarry but talented cast. Cilian Murphy taking the lead role as the ship's resident physicist Cappa the only member who has the wherewithal to actually drop the bomb is coolly enigmatic as ever the blue orbs of his eyes forming a nice counterpoint to the never far rather redder orb of the sun. You can't help but feel he isn't particularly challenged as an actor but nevertheless he provides a suitably ambivalent androgynous and faintly unsettling core to the proceedings. Perhaps more impressive is Chris Evans. Recently seen in a similarly hot headed role in the undercooked comic book adaptation 'Fantastic Four' he consistently snatches scenes from Murphy as engineer Mace about as volatile and fiery as Cappa is composed and cool. Without Evan's energetic performance the film would sink into an antilibidinal quag. Mace's emotive instability injects pace when it's needed and brings some welcome variety to the otherwise glum faces. Evans is surely on the brink of big things. A small quibble would be that there are perhaps a few too many characters meaning that a fair share of the cast never really gets a chance for development which is irritating as one gets the feeling that there's a lot of wasted potential.Another chink in Sunshine's spacesuit is in many places Alex Garland's screenplay. Whilst he has a remarkable talent for creating intense psychological tension of which there is plenty in Sunshine his philosophising is much less satisfactory. This is not to say he doesn't play with some fascinating ideas. With the crew circling so close to the Sun to the giver of life Garland begins ask the biggest of questions. Is there something something inestimably greater than ourselves something that could create such a magnificent star or are we like the sun simply dust? It's a great idea but for the larger part of the film it seems oddly shoehorned into what is at base a scifi potboiler. In fact these ideas are better expressed in Boyle's imagery. Time and time again we see members of the crew staring aghast at the immensity of the burning ball of gas and dust in front of them. The relationship between giver and taker is better explored here than in any line of Garland's. The structure of his screenplay is also a little unwieldy. The first hour and a half play as an intense psychological study  the pace at times painfully weighty as the tension is ratcheted up ever higher. The film works beautifully here  it may not introduce anything particularly new claustrophobic stress is certainly nothing new in scifi but it follows genre conventions with such panache and artistry that it's difficult to fault. However come the final 20 minutes Sunshine takes a rather abrupt and unwelcome turn. A pretty hammy not to mention poorly explained plot twist is ushered in and suddenly we find ourselves in a horror film  a clichd one at that. To say much more would spoil things but needless to say had the filmmakers showed a little restraint in the closing moments they would have had a real classic on their hands. When the film ditches pretensions and sticks with the clammy slow burn thrills it excels at it's fantastic. When it descends into predictable melodrama it's still alright it's just disappointing considering what we know it's capable of. As such it's remarkably well shot superbly rendered occasionally poignant and occasionally flawed. Whatever the case Sunshine is never far from entirely thrilling and all said and done film recommendations don't come much higher than that.".

It's as if the movie makers halfway through making the movie got hit by some mysterious radiation or virus and abruptly changed their mind turning a space epic adventure with promising potentials into a space horror Bmovie. Permit me to elaborate.I like the cutanddry no nonsense opening when we see the crew of eight after 16 months in space arrives a week ahead of schedule at the edge of the dead zone from which communication with Earth is no longer possible. Their mission is to reignite a dying sun with an explosion something that the previous mission 7 years ago failed to do. In similar movies there is invariably a buildup showing the background the assembling of the team establishing characters and conflicts and so on. Doing away with all these preliminaries in Sunshine is a courageous thing in itself showing the movie makers' confidence that whatever they put on the screen will be spellbound for the audience. For a moment they seem to be right.There are one or two interesting parameters. No pain has been spared in driving the point home that the Sun while the source of all lives on Earth is at the same time the deadliest of enemies particularly at close range. And yet the fascination it has on the crew especially two of them is almost hypnotizing. This theme has been consistently reinforced throughout the movie. There is also careful depiction of the psychological impact of prolonged isolation on some of the crew members.The key turning point of the plot is the discovery of the vehicle lost 7 years ago and the decision to make a detour not to check for survivors but to collect the unused bomb so that the mission will have two chances instead of just one. So far so good. Mishaps happen along the way naturally. In this genre the audience in prepared to accept a certain degree of weak logic. But as incredulity develops to mindboggling proportions you begin to lose interest. For example how can you believe that an expert who carefully calculates every detail of the mechanism for changing the course forgets to take into consideration the effect of the deadly Sun something that is more critical and fundamental to their survival than water and food? But all these mounting plot holes are dwarfed by the complete shift of the movie from a savetheEarth mission to a space horror. Even worse this is not a space horror that is firmly rooted such as Alien. The plot twist in Sunshine despite the elaborate packaging is a sloppy devise of four words one guy gone crazy.The characters in Sunshine stand out neither more nor less compared with those in movies such as Armageddon Deep Impact Core Mission to Mar or other ones you might think of. Cillian Murphy is completely wasted here. He gets a better deal even in Red Eye.On the technical plane this movie is not bad. Images sound editing score all contribute towards the creation of an atmosphere of tension. You would like to put aside your reasoning capacity and enjoy it. But when your tolerance is stretched to a breaking point this movie become memorable for the wrong reasons.".

Images sound editing score all contribute towards the creation of an atmosphere of tension. You would like to put aside your reasoning capacity and enjoy it. But when your tolerance is stretched to a breaking point this movie become memorable for the wrong reasons.";

	schema:reviewBody "How would we cope under the most extreme circumstances imaginable? That is the question posed by Danny Boyle's latest offering and the answer seems to be that anybody can be pushed over the edge it is just a question of what and how much it takes.Danny Boyle seems unable to settle on a genre specialty but it also seems that whatever he turns his hand to he can make work with the exception of romantic comedy  A Life Less Ordinary anyone?. In his latest the sun is dying and we join the 2nd attempt to try and restart the star by delivering a nuclear bomb to kickstart it. Having been alone in space for the past 16 months the eightman crew is approaching its destination but nerves are starting to fray. Then they pick up a signal rom the ship that made the first unsuccessful attempt. Inevitably they go and investigate and problems ensue. When the inevitable disaster occurs jeopardising the mission we begin to see how people deal with extreme circumstances and how their sanity is affected in different ways. Elements are recognisable from Alien Solaris and Event Horizon and the film certainly benefits from all of those influences. The claustrophobia the understated technology the dark corridors the unseen menace all recognisable but effectively used.This is not a typical science fiction per se. There are no aliens no space battles and no ultraadvanced technology on show. Instead Boyle chooses a more philosophical tangent leading to questions of exactly what defines humanity and the value of a single life weighed against the future of mankind.The casting is excellent with many recognisable but no particularly famous faces the biggest names being Batman Begins' Cillian Murphy and Fantastic Four's Chris Evans. This lack of star names combined with a cast of only the eight crew somehow makes the loneliness and the feeling of being a huge distance from home with a long way to go seem even more real. We really begin to feel with the crew as they try to hold it together long enough to complete their vital mission. Cillian Murphy in particular is a piece of inspired casting as in many of his roles he has always appeared on the very brink of insanity anyway so he has the closetocrazy act down to a tee.The CGI of the sun is extremely impressive particularly considering the relatively low budget of the film and the simple but intense story has viewers on the edge of the seat virtually from first act to last. The suspense is built gradually but extremely effectively to the extent where you can feel your sanity heading the way of the astronauts' as the conclusion approaches with increasing speed.Overall a very effective study in what a tenuous thing sanity is when faced with huge odds and a great threat. Thrilling gripping and thoughtprovoking and another genre nailed by Boyle  now if only he could crack that pesky romcom!".

It all seems like real things that real people would say from the casual banter to the emotional outpourings and everything in between. Unlike so many other films the characters are human and they act like humans  there is no casual detachment and needless bandying of glib phrases.The effects are exactly what they need to be in balance to this  believable but not distracting from eight very dynamic performances complementing rather than showstealing and overawing.All in all it's more of a psychological thriller than a traditional scifi extravaganza and whilst this has been done many times before  2001 Space Odyssey Solaris Silent Runnings to name a few  Sunshine does it superbly and without fault. I'd highly recommend this film to anyone who is looking for something more than just easy entertainment to kill a couple of hours.

I'm thinking maybe the selection process should have focused a bit more on the maturity of the people saving the human race? Responsibility and all that.The story continues and we have a major catastrophe and the shield is damaged as a result of a human memory malfunction. Two observations1. We have an intelligent ? computer that will override their vital mission to fix the shield in a vital life threatening way but it wouldn't bldy well make the one point something angle correction to the shield when they changed course in the first place! Which thus also endangered the mission Since when do we let computers make judgment calls? Why didn't they again use their codes to override the computer for the mere 30 seconds or so it would take to save the Captains life?2. There was a huge inconvenient fire in the oxygen producing compartment. Now the computer tells the crew many useful things but did it mention there is a fire? Nope. Was there an effective way to deal with this risk? Again no. Unless you consider burning the oxygen you need to survive effective..... I might mention here that the implication is that the trees have created so much pure oxygen that the fire is particularly violent. Um surely you have been feeding the trees CO2 or basically the same air everyone is breathing?Moving on...We have the space jump from the Icarus 1. Some guy we really don't care who ends up in the absolute cold of space behind the shield. Absolute cold of space being 273 degrees Kelvin we're told so pretty rapidly he freezes. Now that's tough I guess but it's even worse it's just wrong.If we assume there is no radiant heat coming from the shield itself here's the story. Space is a vacuum a vacuum is nothing so it is neither hot or cold. If there is no radiant heat source present then an object will radiate it's heat without gaining any in return until it's all gone. This occurs at absolute zero which is 273 degrees Kelvin. Good so far.The reason freezing instantly is rubbish is because the writers haven't realized that there is no heat loss by conduction as in air but only by radiation. This can be a very slow process. Which is why we put hot drinks in a vacuum flask to keep it hot a vacuum is the best insulator. Basically freezing would be the least of your worries in space without a suit.A few more minor points too sharp to swallowThe shield has lots of moving parts that don't appear to be useful...  If the plan all along was for the shieldbomb unit to fly into the heart of the Sun what was going to protect the spacecraft on the return journey? What was going to protect the bomb when it entered the Sun and the heat could come from behind?  Why can you simply raise the absolutely vital mainframe computer out of it's coolant without any safety devices or alarms going off? To override a mission saving action by the computer you need two people and security codes... Once you raise it although it turns off in a while it will destroy itself somehow. To service it the best way is to dive into freezing water and use a....spanner. The system that raises and lowers it has enough grunt to trap and maim a human being.

	schema:headline " To say there is nothing new under the sun is usually apt in sunny Hollywood but not this time";
	schema:reviewBody "With a suitably international and diverse cast to simulate the equivalent crew onboard the Icarus II Icarus I didn't fare so well director Danny Boyle fledges a science fiction that gains momentum at its very first image  and does not halt until the end credits roll. To be perfectly frank this is one of the most unbearably exciting films for whose entire duration I have ever squirmed in my seat for at the theatre.On a mission to reignite the sun by detonating a bomb the size of Manhattan island Cillian Murphy's physicist nods to American audiences and cause me to suffer horrible flashbacks to Armaggeddon's it's the size of Texas assessment human lives are expendable and rationalized by rank. There are scientists astronauts and various specialists on Icarus II who are all poised on the brink of sacrificing themselves for the greater good of mankind. Diverse in the sense that there are both men and women and few characters are 'black or white' morally and physically it does puzzle me that New Zealanders Aussies and Irishmen have been arbitrarily converted into Americans. The crew is nevertheless highly impressive and professional with a few minor exceptions for plotpropelling purposes like when someone does something very stupid.There is noticeably a tremendous visual sense throughout Sunshine with a screen that is awash with sparkling explosions and each frame saturated with bright colours and dimmed contrasts. There is no genretranscending perhaps and most probably its visuals are under the mercy of dating effects but for now this is truly the crme de la crme of science fiction take my word for it. Even the cinematography within the spaceship alleys and chambers is compelling and sweeps through Icarus II with great tracking shots. Amongst other films Danny Boyle was inspired by Das Boot and certainly there are traces of the same claustrophobia underpinning the setting but ultimately he opted for a more habitable environment to make it believable like humanity would ship off its only hope with a crummy crowded old vessel.To justify the occasional bouts of scifi clichs I'd like to firstly point out that it's not like Sunshine traffics in stereotypes or resorts to formulaic elements and secondly that I believe certain clichs have evolved for a reason  they quite clearly stand the test of time. There are within science fiction some staples that are simply necessary to define its genre such as the dutiful human sacrifices to up the drama the internal mutinies to instill the uncertainty in the operation the nightmarish conditions onboard the ship to suck you in the technical jargon of velocities and shield angles that spits like bulletfire to give the film a firm scientific footing and finally the epic music to elevate suspense.

	onyx:emotionText "With a suitably international and diverse cast to simulate the equivalent crew onboard the Icarus II Icarus I didn't fare so well director Danny Boyle fledges a science fiction that gains momentum at its very first image  and does not halt until the end credits roll. To be perfectly frank this is one of the most unbearably exciting films for whose entire duration I have ever squirmed in my seat for at the theatre.On a mission to reignite the sun by detonating a bomb the size of Manhattan island Cillian Murphy's physicist nods to American audiences and cause me to suffer horrible flashbacks to Armaggeddon's it's the size of Texas assessment human lives are expendable and rationalized by rank. There are scientists astronauts and various specialists on Icarus II who are all poised on the brink of sacrificing themselves for the greater good of mankind. Diverse in the sense that there are both men and women and few characters are 'black or white' morally and physically it does puzzle me that New Zealanders Aussies and Irishmen have been arbitrarily converted into Americans. The crew is nevertheless highly impressive and professional with a few minor exceptions for plotpropelling purposes like when someone does something very stupid.There is noticeably a tremendous visual sense throughout Sunshine with a screen that is awash with sparkling explosions and each frame saturated with bright colours and dimmed contrasts. There is no genretranscending perhaps and most probably its visuals are under the mercy of dating effects but for now this is truly the crme de la crme of science fiction take my word for it. Even the cinematography within the spaceship alleys and chambers is compelling and sweeps through Icarus II with great tracking shots. Amongst other films Danny Boyle was inspired by Das Boot and certainly there are traces of the same claustrophobia underpinning the setting but ultimately he opted for a more habitable environment to make it believable like humanity would ship off its only hope with a crummy crowded old vessel.To justify the occasional bouts of scifi clichs I'd like to firstly point out that it's not like Sunshine traffics in stereotypes or resorts to formulaic elements and secondly that I believe certain clichs have evolved for a reason  they quite clearly stand the test of time. There are within science fiction some staples that are simply necessary to define its genre such as the dutiful human sacrifices to up the drama the internal mutinies to instill the uncertainty in the operation the nightmarish conditions onboard the ship to suck you in the technical jargon of velocities and shield angles that spits like bulletfire to give the film a firm scientific footing and finally the epic music to elevate suspense. Sunshine incorporates and melts together all of the aforementioned but in militantly nonformulaic ways that only add to the experience. As a potent example there isn't just pedestrian classical tunes recycled from 2001 and filtered through insert rote Hollywood composer here's score  it is puffed full of beautiful piano crescendos that are almost incongruous to the scifi vibe and the cumulative effect is wonderful.Sunshine is sporadically blemished by minor faults such as when Murphy's Law is being followed a bit too rigorously to up the excitement.

	schema:reviewBody "I had high expectations for this film as the scenario is an interesting one. Unfortunately the film is clumsily structured and incoherent in parts and many elements are contrived to keep the crew in danger. Here's a not quite comprehensive list The movie opens with a voiceover explaining the situation and you jump right into the ship. Since there's no shots showing what is actually happening on Earth until the very end I didn't feel invested in the mission. Any science that was once in the script has been gutted here  there's no mention of WHY the sun is dying or exactly how the bomb will restart it although an interesting theory about a Qparticle infesting the sun is on the production blog.You'll be confused by some of the most incoherent fight scenes ever filmed. With his extreme closeups and quick cuts Boyle can't even pull off a 20 second fight in a corridor without losing the audience. It gets worse with the Pinbacker character who's filmed so blurry and artsy that my wife seriously thought he was some kind of transdimensional alien.For such a critical mission the Icarus ships are not very robust. They contain only one airlock even the shuttle has two ways to get out! one mainframe that depends on a constant supply of coolant with no backup computer and no emergency lighting. Instead of the habitat spinning to provide gravity which would make more sense than the nevermentioned but apparent artificial gravity the only part of the ship that spins are the communication antennas  the one part you want stationary and pointing to Earth. The heat shield is composed of thousands of mechanical louvers with no imaginable function instead of a simple solid piece. I rarely had a clear idea as to where anything was in this ship for example the viewing room was cut into the bomb's heat shield but there was no impression that anyone had to walk through the bomb area to get there.Oxygen levels play a big part in the suspense with Michelle Yeoh calculating that there's only enough air for four crew. Yet this was a vast ship with literally cubic acres of air in the bomb area alone which begs the question why have air around the bomb at all?. And all this oxygen was generated by the small plant area? I don't think so.Why exactly did the first probe fail? Did everyone just decide to burn themselves up? Didn't quite catch that explanation.If the mainframe fails there's only one person who can operate the bomb. Why weren't the rest of the crew trained to operate it? What else did they have to practice on for 16 months? The bomb will be traveling so fast space  time will break down? Please. This thing is the mass of Manhattan you're not going to accelerate it very fast.Why was communication lost as they neared Mercury? We've had probes go to Mercury and even closer to the sun and we've talked to them just fine.All remaining plausibility flees at the end when Capa detonates the bomb and has a leisurely gaze at..what? The wall of nuclear flame? The fires of creation? You tell me. The famously cryptic 2001 made a lot more sense than this.In general much of the film impressed me as contrived situations to keep the crew in danger. This movie had a lot of potential but Danny Boyle chose to get lost in his own head.".

Secondly the following is as disjointed as the film it addresses.So many glowing reviews I've read for Sunshine seem to center around the idea that one must simply give in to the power and majesty of the film's visuals. That is to say one must in the presence of Sunshine emphasize oohing and ahhing over thinking.I'm sorry I can't do that. Ironically if Sunshine were being touted as a dumb bit of fluff I'd be far more likely to take it at face value. But Sunshine's makers and culties have trumpeted their darling as a slice of intelligent scifi ohsorare these days etc.Frankly it's not. That intelligent thing. Not a bit of it.Thoughts If you hire a physicist to act as a consultant on your film and if your screenwriter concocts backstories for your characters and if you house your actors in barebones student digs and send them up in airplanes that permit them to experience zerog all so that they feel like real astronauts and if all that consulting and all those stories and all that experience don't end up on the screen i.e. if you expect us viewers to mine the film's websites for this science and these tales then you as a filmmaker that means you Mr. Boyle haven't done your job. Simple.We don't know who these characters are so we don't care about them. Sure Rose Byrne has her teary brown doeeyes so she captures an instant sympathy vote and Hiroyuki Sanada draws us in with his calm and his silky voice. But the rest of 'em? Cillian Murphy comes off as a stoner and a bit of a jerk and Chris Evans tries desperately to make something of the duty card he's been dealt but the rest of 'em are ciphers. Alex Garland seems to think that character development is for sissies or that it's certainly not important if you have a Big Idea here Our Lives Are Secondary to the Saving of All Humanity Dontchaknow. I politely suggest that he's dead wrong. If we don't give a rat's patootie about the characters we certainly won't care about the idea in the service of which they're acting.And not only are they ciphers they're inconsistent too. Early on Mace goads Capa the only one capable of operating the stellar bomb in itself a ridiculous idea what in sixteen months Capa couldn't train a backup to turn the key and press the LAUNCH button? Job security I guess. into performing a highly dangerous repair job outside the ship. Then later when he and Capa and another of the Icarus II's hapless crew must execute an illadvised humancannon trick between two crippled airlocks a situation that falls squarely between Don't ask. and What the hell? Mace insists that Capa take the only available spacesuit as he's indispensable to the mission. Sure Mace earlier may have been feeling piqued and petty Capa having pulled a bit of a careless dumb with regard to their window for sending messages home but the fact here is that it's not my job to make Mace's excuses. It's Mr. Garland's job and his script simply doesn't deliver.Don't try to cover up the paperthinness of your story by snowing us with special effects. It's insulting and annoying. Just how many useless beauty shots of the Icarus II does this movie contain anyway? Not one of them helps us to know where we are on the ship. Also if you can't afford the effects you wanted for your thirdact mad slasher did I already mention the Don't ask. thing? don't try to cover by shaking the camera and overexposing your shots every time said slasher is on screen. That takes annoying clear up to blatantly irritating.Smart people creating jeopardy by making dumb choices or nonsensically arbitrary decisions is less likely to evoke sympathy than smart people who find themselves in peril because of natural disasters or mechanical catastrophes. That is a supposedly smart guy who makes a calculation that leads to half a spaceship going up in flames is less likely to earn a You poor people! from me than say a freak solar flare that leads to half of said spaceship going up in flames. And have I mentioned yet how much I despise selectively smart computers? As in a computer that talks to you and calls you by name and yet can't tell you when half your spaceship has just caught on fire? Not that it's entirely the computer's fault here the fire thing it happens during one of Sunshine's many randomly placed beauty shots so it's quite likely that the computer like the viewing audience isn't sure if the ship that catches fire is actually the Icarus II the ship on which Our Story is taking place. Oh look there's a ship on fire over there. Hey do you smell smoke...?Selective flammability Not only do Capa and the film's Mystery Slasher not burn up when Capa hoping to effect a desperate getaway yells Full sunlight! in the observation lounge of the Icarus II the lounge itself doesn't burn up. By comparison when the show's nutter psychologist again don't ask tries the full sunlight thing he burns up just fine thank you.So who gets the star? It's a split Chris Evans who tries so desperately to be the voice of reason if only for a moment on this ship of fools and Underworld and John Murphy who were obviously watching a much more intelligent moving and dramatic film when they concocted the score.Even though it's rare to see a movie so lovingly misconceived you'd be wise to give this a miss. Dumb depressing muddled and thoroughly unentertaining.".

I suppose I should have paid more attention to the reviewer that said One word of advice this movie is not for nitpickers or physicist yet still gave it 8 stars.I'm neither a nitpicker nor a physicist but as a reasonably intelligent person there are limits to how far I am willing to suspend disbelief. The whole premise of the movie is on very shaky ground The sun is dying and the first mission to launch some kind of bomb into the sun failed so mankind has sent the second and this is our Last Hope.Now this bomb whatever it's supposed to be and to do is not really explained very well. I gather that the specifics are given here on IMDb and the movie's website kind of odd to leave that out of the movie itself. I'm also not sure how a bomb with the mass of Manhattan is supposed to reignite the sun which can fit 1000000 Earths inside of it but then perhaps I'm being nitpicky.The next thing that begs explanation is why they need to get so close to the sun to launch this bomb in the first place. Why not launch it from the vicinity of say Venus's orbit? We can make pinpoint unmanned landings on Mars but a target the size of the sun seems to be a problem.The physicist is the only one who knows how to properly turn the key and hit the launch button on the bomb say what? yet he is 'volunteered' to go on a dangerous spacewalk with no objections. Later on he is given the only spacesuit so that he is assured survival. Apparently his essentialness comes and goes.After various implausible mishaps involving human error and a computer that only seems to correct these errors when it's in the mood we learn that they only have enough oxygen for 4 people to make it to the launch point. Now this ship is huge. I mean really really big. It's also full of air. Remember Apollo 13 with 3 guys in the tiny capsulelunar module? Even they had enough air to get back home. Yet 5 people on this massive ship would use up all the O2 in less than a day.I could go on a lot longer and you can read other reviews for even more ludicrous problems with this script but you get my drift here. Yes visually the exterior shots are great though random without giving a sense of where things are happening. Looking pretty isn't enough to save this movie however.".

There were immediate problems from the very beginning such as using a calm voice when it should be awed and the exact opposite as regards the music but I liked the fact that none of the crew members were either particularly heroic or evil but just ordinary people. But I certainly sat there wondering where the hell this story was going. Then came the last part and as is the case with so many bad movies it went straight to hell in a handbasket. Throughout the movie the logic between events were unclear. Where were we? How did we get from one situation to the next? How did this or that bit work? There was an abject lack of explanations for a host of things from what exactly was wrong with the sun and to just what it was that caused the Earthroom fire.But it can be argued that these elements are not important because the producers were trying for an art movie. So the substance is all in the themes World is doomed scientists are trying to save it insane religious fanaticism is sabotaging science. Also the scene where they vote on whether to kill Trey Cassie is the conscience the emotional and irrational heart among all the rational analyses. Sure. Nice themes. But utilized inside the confines of an utterly incompetently structured narrative.Nothing made sense. For instance I could write several pages on the zany way this movie treated gravity. And how it tried to get by on clichs. And was unsuccessful in building suspense due to sloppy writing directing editing and sound effects. The creators of this movie know very little about science fiction and they should stick to what they do marginally well horror.Sunshine was a failure and its IMDb rating currently a staggering 7.8!! will plummet when more people such as actual SF fans and people who're not friends of the director see it. Halfway through it I thought it might merit a 5 rating but the ending was so ludicrous unbelievable and stupidly put together that I can only end up awarding the movie a 2 out of 10. I now believe this movie has the worst ending of any scifi movie I have ever seen. Event Horizon move over!Sheeze.".

I'd echo the other comments on here  it mixes elements of 2001 A Space Oddessy with Event Horizon then adds the tension of Alien. This is NOT the gungho action of Armageddon The Core et al.The film just throws you straight into the space mission there's no background to worry about only these 8 crew members headed towards the sun. The great thing about this cast is that there's no superstar billing so you're never sure who is going to make it alive to the end of the film! The actors are uniformly good with Chris Evans in particular deserving much praise. Michelle Yeoh delivers a very understated performance very different from her asskicking Asian roles! Danny Boyle has always been good with characters but with Sunshine he really steps up a level. Visually this film is astonishing and literally had me open mouthed at times. The production design costumes the sound design the music from Underworld... they all combine to give the viewer an amazing cinematic experience that you'll want to watch for a second time just to take it all in.Whilst it's an exciting tense film to watch there's no denying the serious point of Sunshine's message. It's a film about preserving the future of mankind and the sacrifices that have to be made in order to do that... and it will make you think long after the credits have rolled.A fantastic achievement  one which deserves to be seen on the big screen when it opens worldwide. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "I went into the cinema with mixed expectations. The premise  a team of scientists sent with a giant bomb to return our dying sun to normal levels  seemed Bmovie material of the worst kind. I could just imagine cardboard cutout characters clichd plot twists and a truck of scientific errors. Yet this is directed by Danny Boyle Trainspotting 28 Days Later so who knew maybe he could work the same magic he did on zombie flicks on the disasterinspace subgenre. I am surprised to report Sunshine delivered on all of these points.Cillian Murphy star of 28 Days Later returns as ship's primary physicist Capa. He and the rest of the 8 crew members of Manhattansized bomb Icarus II are on a mission to fix the Sun which is cooling perilously. 16 months in and something forces a change of plan. The previous failed expedition is discovered floating in orbit of our star. It's when Capa makes the decision that they change course for the Icarus I that things start going wrong. One small mistake leads to great danger which causes more havoc and forces the desperate saviours of humanity to take even more dangerous risks and so on all culminating in an insane and murderous survivor rampaging through the ship with a motorised scalpel.Up until actually reaching the Icarus I it's all so Apollo 13 and so good. Spoton characterisation beautiful long shots and rather familiar set design watch out for the cockpit. But it's when Sunshine tries to be a psychologicalthriller and a scifi and a horror flick and an action movie that it all starts to go horribly wrong as a film. It loses direction  maybe because Danny Boyle is too busy looking over the computer graphics guys' shoulders and saying Ooh that looks cool. Hey how about we obscure half the action? Or put in pseudosubliminal images? Or blur the screen?Orstoptheframe? Addsomeghostingthere!Andthere!Andblurthis! Andputaflashoflightthere! Individually each graphic trick that Boyle tries looks really really cool and usually flows properly but when he throws them into the movie like Picasso throws paint it gets very tiring awfully quickly. Quite frankly it gives me a headache even to remember it.What plot is full of holes too. Some may actually have been explained but I must have blinked during those frames. For example and worst by far is that they seem to ignore the effect of the Sun's gravity for the most part. If an object is thrust parallel with the spin of the Sun gravity should pull them towards it in a curve but instead they travel in a totally straight line. Bah.It's such a shame that Sunshine ends up so incomprehensible and random because it is packed full of good ideas. It's apparent that they tried to do too much at once and weren't critical enough to get rid of the stuff that was unnecessary or didn't work. Still the 'lesser of two evils' theme running through certainly makes food for thought. It's refreshing to see such sensible characters who know what's at stake. Would you kill a friend to save humanity and all the solar system? What about three friends? More? That's the question isn't it...I can't recommend watching this film. It's smart it's oh so beautiful it's well acted... but it has collapsed under its own weight into nothing more than sunscorched stardust. Go watch Pitch Black or dig out that old VHS of Apollo 13 Alien or the Abyss. Anything. Just not this.".

I haven't seen 2001 or Event Horizon and I don't remember anything about Alien.

The shots of the sun are some of the most fascinating bits of effects I have ever seen in any sort of film not only scifi. The film is set only fifty years into the future and therefore the technological aspects of the set are relatable rather than hard to imagine.The characters are well developed and the actors are topnotch. Every single performance is phenomenal and I was even a bit taken aback by how much I enjoyed Chris Evans's portrayal of Mace. Everyone seems to have taken the time to learn about the science and about the psychological factors of being with the same people for so long most likely due to the fact that Danny Boyle sort of forced them to and it shows on screen. The characters are all real and although none of us know what it would be like to be in space and alone for sixteen months there are aspects of them all that are immediately relatable.The plot is secondary. That doesn't mean that it isn't well thought or anything like that but the human drama and psychological journey of the characters is the primary concern in the film and the fact that they are going to reignite the sun is merely the background story that puts them all together in the first place. There are far more triggers that ask the audience to think about their life and the life of mankind and of the universe itself than there are for the audience to question Well how did that just happen? The film asks us to have a brain and be willing to use it.Sunshine is a religious experience. It is very personal and is a very unique experience to each member of the audience. It is incredible aweinspiring intense and one of the most beautiful pieces of film I have ever seen. Danny Boyle Alex Garland and Andrew Macdonald have done it again. A.".

And guess what? The two that once seemed chunks of rankest Velveeta now blossomed like the sweetest of Edams next to Sunshine. Call me oldfashioned but I like films to be entertaining. I like them to have plots that progress with a semblance of logic. Oh and I like films that have characters. With character. Event Horizon and Supernova at least take a shot at those criteria. Sunshine places itself above such silliness. Oh Mr. Garland what were you thinking...? After the third draft let alone the thirtyfourth you should by now know enough to say to yourself This isn't working is it? Mr. Boyle What possessed you to want to film this script...? And all of you in the cast How high was the bar tab when you signed on the dotted line...? So many reviewers have singed this thing already that I'll focus on a few idiosyncratic annoyances and have done.We're told and shown throughout Sunshine that the sun will burn you to a crisp in less time than it takes to think the phrase bug zapper and yet at the end Cillian Murphy's scientisthippiesavant Capa stands facetoface with a roiling wall of solar plasma without so much as a blister on his milkwhite skin. Of course earlier he mumbles something about the laws of physics not applying within the sun itself and I guess he's the expert so he ought to know but I can't help but wonder silly things like how the sun can burn right through the wall of the bomb housing which bomb for some reason requires a crew of nuts to run it right up to the sun I guess there's a real danger of missing a target as tiny as Old Sol without burning right on through him too. It burns through him eventually sure but not before we're treated to the Obligatory Poetic Destiny Moment. Earlier in the show another character roars in agony as he roasts alive in direct sunlight here now in the Land of the Big Finale Capa gets to look all wondering and angelic as the solar breeze flutters his flowing locks. It's as if Danny Boyle took the afternoon off given the sloppy direction throughout the film a month or two off wouldn't have been out of line and flagged Steven Spielberg in full goldenglowy schlock mode to stand in for him.Another random ranting Even though the film's makers and supporters yodel to all and sundry about how their marvelous pictureshow manages to get by without any aliens or supernatural elements Sunshine's thirdact mystery killer is not only superduper strong okay so maybe toting the admittedly erm fineboned Cillian Murphy around by the throat would realistically call only for reasonably strong no super or duper about it he's completely immune to wild extremes of heat and cold. He takes a blast of full sunlight the same brand of full sunlight that incinerates at least two other characters without so much as an Ouch! then he removes from their silly huge open vat of cooling liquid the ship's preposterously big computer components and suffers not the least touch of frostbite even though frostbite fatally mauls the poor schmuck saddled with the task of redunking those components.About halfway through I started thinking how much fun Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright would have making a parody of Sunshine. By the end however I'd modified the thought in two ways 1. the Pegg parody would have a beginning a middle and an end action one could follow and warmth humor and heart all of which Sunshine lacks in spades and 2. the parody had already begun. Maybe it was a preemptive strike on the part of Boyle and Garland but by the time they were milking for drama the fact that Mr. Murphy had fallen in his spacesuit note to Mr. Boyle don't EVER admit that you based a spacesuit design on Kenny from South Park. Trust me on this. and yes! couldn't get up I burst out laughing. Oh he's grunting he's sweating he's making that deeply endearing Nnnnnnnggghhh! sound that signals to fluttery fanears and hearts worldwide that He Cillian Murphy Is In Distress and it's one of the most crackerjack funny film moments I've seen in months. Which months in fact included a Pegg parody Hot Fuzz. Perhaps Boyle and Garland should hearken to a new calling.'Cause scifi certainly isn't their strong suit.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film twice. Both viewings left me with an entirely new experience. This is what I admire about the talented duo of Danny Boyle and Alex Garland. They both envision an entertainment encounter enhanced by a subversive message regarding human issues of today. As an intelligent film Sunshine provides a slate of questions which are answered by you the viewer. There is no wrong way to view this film. It acts like a selfportrait where the film becomes the paint and you become the painter.The plot follows a crew of eight scientistsastronauts who set out on an epic mission towards the Sun a star which is dying due to internal deterioration by a Q Ball see httpwww.sunshinedna.com?p236. On their ship Icarus II they carry a Stellar Bomb which is mastered by the physicist Capa Cillian Murphy. After they reach Mercury a transmission is heard from the first spaceship that failed the mission. From there the action begins. The CGI was impressive especially the reflective solar panels on the spaceship. The Sun is a spectacular sight to see. Its magnificence and peril are certainly shown in the film. Despite this the CGI is not overpowering. The complexity of the characters parallel if not exceed the welldone special effects.Since Sunshine features an ensemble cast it is really hard to point out only one actor who succeeded among the rest. All of them  wellknown and not  portrayed their characters to the fullest and brought their best talents to the big screen. Murphy did a fantastic acting performance as Capa. Scientific jargon was not at all a problem with this character. He made you believe Capa's expertise in physics as well as his lack of it as a noncareer astronaut. Another standout performance resonates from the beautiful actress Rose Byrne. Her emotional dynamic is tested in this project and she pulls it off to an uncommon level. Do not be swayed by her looks alone. If her previous film Troy did not catapult her into the public eye Sunshine will no doubt brighten her Hollywood status. If you plan on refusing Sunshine because of Chris Evans you will severely regret it. Although typecast as a comedy actor he truly shines as quite the opposite in this film. Not only does he captivate the audience with his hothead apathetic persona as the engineer Mace he sets himself apart from his popular film characters like Johnny Storm in Fantastic Four. As to be expected in thrilling horror films Evans also contributes mild comedic relief in various places to lighten up the wave of high tension Sunshine offers. In the end Mace's redeeming quality puts him outside the realm of antagonist.Murphy Byrne and Evans were the only actors who I knew fairly well beforehand. However after being a webmistress of a Sunshine fansite httpsunshine.efan.org and watching the film twice I became a fan of everyone. Michelle Yeoh is an international sensation and her performance in Sunshine leaves me breathless every time. She plays the biologist Corazon and her passion toward the Oxygen Garden and living plants is apparent in everything Yeoh does  especially the deep emotion expressed in her eyes and voice. Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada is by far one of the best selections in the Sunshine cast. His role as Captain Kaneda is complimented by Sanada's natural dominating and respected presence on screen. Kaneda's impact on the film is pivotal and memorable throughout. Out of the entire cast Benedict Wong Cliff Curtis and Troy Garity are perhaps the least known. The lovely Benedict Benny Wong deserves much better recognition than he has had in the past. He was said to have acted too intensely in one scene. If you have seen Sunshine you will realize how meaningful that statement is and the level at which Wong performs. New Zealander Cliff Curtis plays the doctor Searle. As Searle Curtis introduces one of the main points embedded in the film and becomes a solid player in the ideological arena. The communications officer Harvey Troy Garity's character can be misunderstood if you have not read the character backstories see httpwww.sunshinedna.com?p247. Garity successfully captures his essence to the say the least.Sunshine is not supposed to intimidate you into believing anything nor did I leave the theater feeling that way. It is simply a film that expanded the thrills and excitement of a science fiction piece to a powerful human drama. If you would rather not inspect its deeper implications you can still appreciate Sunshine for its fictitious and pleasurable value. The action and emotion flooding the film keeps you on the edge of your seat. Who will survive? Will they complete the mission? Watch it and be amazed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Danny Boyle has rebooted the scifi genre to a magnificent start. Sunshine clearly inspired by the classics Alien 2001 A Space Odyssey and many more but brought to the modern age.The plot sounds ridiculous at first but once you get into it you really get into it! A crew of 8 are sent on a mission to set a bomb in the sun as it is dying and the earth is suffering a solar winter. 7 years before that there was a similar mission but that failed. They find the lost spacecraft and decide to board it but a fatal incident occurred that lost them their oxygen supply. There is no longer enough for all of them to get back to earth alive. But there is enough for few so who will take the plunge and who will survive? And will their sanities stay intact to last them the epic journey? With such a small cast there was surprisingly no weak performances. Everyone had the desired screentime to be able to care for them. But the characters anger and frustration caught up with them after being on the ship for 16 months they begin to take acts of violence on each other and feel stressed so they forget vital aspects that could cost them their lives. You have to remember that they will save mankind if their mission is a success that's a lot of pressure. And the film feels like a lot of pressure due to the intenseness it creates.Boyle's skills to create tension is impressive. He uses special techniques to make us feel claustrophobic and more importantly to panic. Close ups angles blurs stretches stops flashes all add up to the effect. The effect of feeling the heat. It burns. But in between those scenes you get to see the relaxing side of space. The view from outside. Its beautiful truly dazzling and spectacular.The score is incredible. During the beginning its like a calm 'breather'. But then its turns into a beat. A fast beat. And your heart joins it. Pumping away to make you feel more insecure. Very intense.Boyle really proves he has talent for different genres in this modern scifi to be classic showing how people do the most inhumane thing to survive. I highly recommend it. Rewatches over the years have revealed its flaws and clichs but it's still enjoyable and nostalgic for me.810".

Red Planet was a good science fiction film. 2001 A Space Odyssey was a good science fiction film until the last five minutes. Sunshine doesn't even come close.Apart from the absurd premise of the film the sun is going out so we'll go and set off a nuclear bomb inside it to fix it  yeah that'll work! there is absolutely no explanation as to why the crew of the Icarus I all died nor why Pinbacker sp?? went nuts and wanted to kill everyone...not to mention how he managed to survive on his own for six years with 3rd degree burns all over his body.If it's called science fiction it should at least PRETEND to be somewhat scientifically accurate. Here's a hint or two for the filmmakers 1 People do not freeze do death in space. They asphyxiate. Vacuum is a terrific insulator not conductor which is why we use vacuum flasks to keep liquids hot or cold. You can only lose heat in space via radiation not conduction or convection.2 Only a lunatic would create a ship for 8 crewmembers and rely on fruit  vegetables to produce oxygen. There are far more efficient ways of doing it using electricity  which should be plentiful considering how much solar energy was available! 3 Gravity is either produced by mass or simulated by a rotating habitat. Good scifi films do not have magical gravity that suddenly switches on and drops everyone to the floor when the airlock repressurizes. It's fine in Star Trek or Star Wars but it just looks stupid in an ostensibly hard scifi film.Don't waste your time with this piece of drivel. It's two hours you'll never get back. Watch Red Planet or The Island if you want some decent science fiction...".

Vacuum is a terrific insulator not conductor which is why we use vacuum flasks to keep liquids hot or cold. You can only lose heat in space via radiation not conduction or convection.2 Only a lunatic would create a ship for 8 crewmembers and rely on fruit  vegetables to produce oxygen. There are far more efficient ways of doing it using electricity  which should be plentiful considering how much solar energy was available! 3 Gravity is either produced by mass or simulated by a rotating habitat. Good scifi films do not have magical gravity that suddenly switches on and drops everyone to the floor when the airlock repressurizes. It's fine in Star Trek or Star Wars but it just looks stupid in an ostensibly hard scifi film.Don't waste your time with this piece of drivel. It's two hours you'll never get back. Watch Red Planet or The Island if you want some decent science fiction...";

	schema:reviewBody "No seriously. The Green Berets is about as viable and creditable as The Boys in Company C or Casualties of War. It's hard to find a Vietnam war movie that DOESN'T come full of distortions based on the film makers political agendas it's just this time The Green Berets comes from the proinvolvement side.We've heard the negatives about this movie and most of them are basically correct but there are a few things to say that if not positive put the movie in a less negative light.First this isn't your usual piece about 19 year old conscripts being called up to fight in a war they don't understand. The real Special Forces are career professionals who have very high standards of training and discipline. The Green Berets isn't a movie about your average grunt it's about commandos and a lot of the training tactics and equipment is accurate for the time. The experience of the special forces in Vietnam was widely different from line conscripts and they won a lot of victories.Second it was a bold move to make a movie about the Vietnam war whilst it was still going on. The movie was made shortly before the Tet Offensive of 1968 when the initiative was still with the US and South Vietnamese forces. This is a Vietnam war movie from the early part of the war...something Platoon falls down on is depicting the unit in a state of disorganisation with the usual drug taking and indiscipline scenes that have become clich in 1967 when the reality was that discipline and cohesion in the field in '67 was a lot tighter. Stone depicts events that would not become common in front line troops until '69'70. Yes I know he served a tour of duty over there but a number of his fellow veterans have called his depiction of events into question.Third the early part of the movie with the relationships between US Special Forces officers and ARVN counterparts is fairly well done. The SF had been present in Vietnam from '62 onwards and by '67'68 had built up a good working relationship with ARVN Ranger units the only South Vietnamese army units that were well trained and led.Now the pine tree issue. Well I hate to break it to people but not all of Vietnam is palm trees and jungle. In the area of Cochinchina just north of Saigon and into the hilly Montangnard country there are a lot of deciduous and evergreen trees. I was surprised to find this when doing research on the US 25th Infantry Division and finding a lot of their patrol area wasn't in jungle but hilly woodland. Pine trees maybe stretching things a little bit though but it's not impossible.The politics. Yes the Duke is on the right wing campaign trail but other film makers have used the Vietnam war to promote the liberal left agenda so I don't get why that is acceptable and an alternative view that doesn't conform to that is inherently wrong. The scene at the beginning of the movie has Aldo Ray explaining how China Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union were sending aid to North Vietnam...so Oliver Stone's assertions that the VC were selfliberating and proudly defiant are deeply wrong. The VC and NVA were tools of a communist regime that were being heavily supplied and subsidised by other Communist regimes. I'm not advocating that the US's involvement in a war in Vietnam was right just that people understand the involvement of other nations as well.For those who think this movie is bad because it doesn't depict American atrocities drug taking and insubordination like other Vietnam war movies have merely bought into another set of falsehoods. This goes back to my original point The Green Berets isn't particularly realistic...but then again neither are most other movies about that war.".

This exciting wartime picture contains thrills  violence  noisy action  breathtaking battles and absurd situations . Don't miss the ending scene where the sun sets in the East  including a patriotic as well as famous music . Nice acting by John Wayne  as usual  he was prompted to make the film as a response to the growing antiVietnam War movement in the US . John Wayne's character  Col. Mike Kirby is based on the reallife Lauri Trni who later on called himself Larry Thorne . The latter was a Finnish army captain who fought in the Second World War during the Winter War 193940 and Continuation War 194144 against the Soviet Union . He emigrated to the US in the late 1940s and in 1954 joined the US Army . Very good support cast  plenty of familiar faces such as Jim Hutton  Aldo Ray  Raymond St. Jacques  Bruce Cabot  Patrick Wayne  Edward Faulkner and Luke Askew . The film was panned by reviewers  general public and many soldiers serving in Vietnam found the film offensive . Being partially based on real events  as the defensive battle that takes place during the second half of the movie is very loosely based on the Battle of Nam Dong  during which two Viet Cong battalions attacked a small outpost in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam . Even George Takei he missed nine episodes of Star Trek has admitted in interviews that while he was grateful to be cast in this film  he nevertheless strongly disagreed with the film's prowar message and felt the finished movie was very bad . Green Berets was released soon after the Tet Offensive and the My Lai Massacre getting negative critiques  too . However  a lot of critics deemed this war film much better than its reputation would suggest . Possibly due to the film's extremely lousy critical reactions  it's been a longheld belief by many people that it was also a boxoffice flop . Actually  it was one of John Wayne's biggest boxoffice successes  attracting millions of moviegoers and ending up being the 13th highest grossing movie of 1968.Colorful cinematography in Panavision by Winton Hoch  filmed on location in Columbus Georgia  and Ft. McClellen Alabama . Much of the film was shot in 1967 at Ft. Benning Georgia hence the large pine forests in the background rather than tropical jungle trees . Good production design  some of the Vietnamese village sets were so realistic they were left intact and were later used by the Army for training troops destined for Vietnam . Impressive and rousing musical score by Mikls Rzsa  similarly composed to previous epics as Ben Hur  King of Kings  El Cid . Lavishly produced by Batjac  Wayne's company and Warner Bros was concerned about letting John Wayne direct the movie because of the fact that his previous directorial effort  El Alamo 1960 had been an expensive flop . They therefore only agreed to let him do the film if he agreed to codirect with a more experienced director and Wayne chose Ray Kellogg . The studio agreed despite Kellogg's only having ever directed a few B pictures such as  The Giant Gila Monster  My dog buddy  The killer shrews  because of his impressive track record as a second unit director on a number of major studio releases . Being John Wayne's final war film  although Undefeated 1969 and Ro Lobo 1970 contained some war scenes .".

	schema:reviewBody "The Green Berets clearly follows the genre of war movies for which John Wayne is famous. While the movie is purely an action adventure it nevertheless has its merits. It does not depict the horrors and suffering of war but it does inspire through the heroism of its characters. It makes the same kind of social and political statement that John Wayne's World War II movies make. Many people pan the picture as simply a piece of propaganda but there is always a place for such films. We forget that stories and movies such as this inspire a sense of courage duty and patriotism. When the movie was released the green beret had taken a seat next to the coon skin cap and cowboy hat. Perhaps it wouldn't hurt us as a society to have more heroes like those depicted in The Green Berets.What was Vietnam truly like? I personally do not know but have learned that it always depends on who you ask. I have met a number of Vietnam veterans and each has a different story to tell. The Vietnamese soldier I am told was no better or worse than the American soldier. Those that look down on the Vietnamese soldiers probably looked down on the Vietnamese people as a whole. One former army ranger who served two tours of duty in Vietnam said they were some of the toughest soldiers he had ever seen. I have also read accounts that the elite units of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam rangers paratroopers marines were indeed very courageous and fierce soldiers. As for the Vietcong and North Vietnamese they were without a doubt brutal and cold blooded. As one posted comment noted The Killing Fields depicts the kind of cruelty that the Vietcong practiced. They were no different than the Khmer Rouge as a few Vietnamese I have met have told me.One thing all Vietnam veterans have in common is a sense of frustration about how the war was fought. Why did we lose the Vietnam war? Perhaps because we never really fought to win.".

I am an American living and working here and personally can attest to this. You must take time to study the geography and flora of this country and it will surprise you. In fact there is desert here just like you might see in Arizona. It lies between Phan Tiet and Nha Trang along the coast. Furthermore if one converses with some of the former Vietnamese soldiers who fought alongside the US here you will hear many stories of how they appreciated the US effort during the war. Many tell me a different story that the US did belong here. Before commentingcome and see for yourself.Regards".

	schema:reviewBody "It is probably impossible to assess the content of this film in other than the context in which it was developed and presented. My own first viewing was in 1968 a matter of mere weeks before having to report for duty in the US Armed Forces. At that time I did not know whether or not I would have to go to Viet Nam as many of my friends already had. Some had already been killed or wounded in action. In this context the film is one I will never forget.John Wayne made this as a political film in an attempt to counter the rising tide of what he and others like him saw as treasonous protests against the government and the military over the conflict in Viet Nam. This horrid almostwar was tearing many families apart in controversy. Wayne wanted to make a patriotic statement of support for the Armed Forces who had been so good to him. He was denied several attempts at enlistment in WWII and was classified 4F. He made films to support the allied war effort then and hoped to show support again even though this was never a real war. Instead he was widely ridiculed by a rabid leftist press.Yes the film was definitely not accurate in the way we have come to demand of today's films. Such accuracy may have been impossible in the political climate of the day. There was deep seated anger in the upper military echelon for not being allowed to wage an actual war. Every engagement between forces was won by the Americans but they were forbidden from the beginning to the end from pressing an attack. The result was perhaps history's worst military Catch 22 fight and then wait for the enemy to regroup rearm and reattack. I still know military people who hate the entire media for the browbeating they gave the military and Congress who  in turn  forbade the military from pressing more aggressive action.Wayne was also attempting to counter people in the entertainment industry whom he and others considered traitors then and still such as Jane Fonda who visited and spoke in support of North Viet Nam.It was this climate Wayne stepped into. His effort was genuine but it resulted in a cameo of the war rather than something palpable. Something that good has yet to be made. Much of what went on real high drama and touching personal stories has been almost entirely ignored by Hollywood. Thus this also remains one of the few films of the hugely controversial era.".

Indeed it was far more likely that the production of a proVietnam War movie was going to be undertaken at this point than an antiVietnam War film. Those antiwar and far superior films wouldn't come until the 1970's and 1980's. But movies like Coming Home Apocolypse Now Platoon etc. weren't better because they were often perceived as antiwar they were just better.The problems with this production are legion. Sure there may be pine trees deserts and a variety of terrain in South Vietnam. So what? This movie looks like a movie filmed on a soundstage that's SUPPOSED to look like South Vietnam and DOES NOT. The war wasn't fought in Georgia. This looks like Georgia. Secondly John Wayne in the latter portion of his career could be quite effective on screen. His performances in The Shootist and True Grit come to mind immediately... and an underrated Wayne film Mark Rydell's The Cowboys in 1972 has a marked rightwing bent and is a terrific movie. Having said that Wayne is truly at his worst in this picture. He is simply too old fat and immobile to play his role convincingly. David Janssen another compelling actor is totally wasted as a stereotypical liberal journalist. Not one character in this movie rings true.That's the main problem with this picture. It isn't its sloppy attention to detail yeah sorry previous posters but the sun setting on the wrong side of the planet IS terrible film making even if it is possible to see it that way in some portions of South Vietnam it's the jingoistic simplicity of the film's entire approach and cardboard characterizations.You've got every form of tired old stereotypical World War II soldier... the brave commander the toughasnails with heartofgold field grunt the subservient natives the soldier who dies so we've got villainy to hang our anger on... no need to go on.What the proVietnam contingent deserved was a threedimensional picture that wasn't geared toward 14yearolds but to adults who even though they were prowar might have had compelling reasons to doubt  as all adults do in times of stress an conflict. This movie demanded characters that didn't superficially deal with the intense difficulties that the war brought up at home and abroad. The whole film is marred by these omission  and by an unrealistic story badly filmed in TV movie of the week fashion. The battle scenes just don't hold up and production seemed rushed. No amount of revisionist reviewing will make this absurdly insulting film any better. It's a truly horrible movie.John Wayne was a talented actor who deserved better but time and time again got stuck with turkeys like this.".

It was John Wayne and the Green Berets was Hollywood's first depiction of our most controversial war when it was still being fought the movie was released the same year as the Tet Offensive. Wayne turned down the role of Major Riesman in The Dirty Dozen to make this film. He had visited Vietnam and was really taken by the courage of the soldiers there especially the special forces and this was his tribute to them how noble! Yes it is hokey and has a rather simplistic viewpoint especially in the opening when they compare the Vietnam war to the thirteen colonies. The critics ripped the hell out of this film but I think they just didn't agree with the viewpoint of it. Anyway leave your brain on off and just enjoy it like another one of John's westerns or war pictures. Duke versus Charlie!".

I have seen this film at least a dozen times and the ruthlessness of the Viet Cong is shown honestly. The scenes with American actors in blackface greyface? portraying VC are rather silly since there weren't too many sixfoot VC around but the Malayan Swing and punji stakes are frighteningly realistic at a time when most Americans had never heard of such barbaric weapons.".

	schema:headline " Were you out there?";
	schema:reviewBody "I watch The Green Berets more than once every year just to stir up both memories and the stewing pot of controversy. In that pot are several ingredients of the movie and of the politics of the time. One of those ingredients is location.Vietnam is an amalgamation of three separate topographies formerly separate countries. Most jungle in the vast delta of the mighty Mekong river has been cleared away for centuries to accommodate rice fields. Much of the central highlands area where this movie is set is forested with pines and lots of scrub growthgrowing in generally poor soil red dust... not too much different than what you will find in parts of North Carolina and Georgia. Were you out there? If not your ideas about the location are merely speculative.When The Green Berets was filmed the war was still going on. So some realism would have to be sacrificed for the safety of cast and crew I think. Thus the sunset 'problem' Shouting at the detail.Another ingredient is the nature of the personnel. That is bona fide Special Forces soldiers were and are completely different than any other force with exceptions for certain Marine Corps units which faced the same situations as did the real Green Berets e.g. at Khe Sanh. NO ONE who was military other than Special Forces has any idea at all of what they did or said. Encirclement of outposts manned by Special Forces or Marine units was always undertaken by regular PAVN People's Army of Vietnam units. The VC were not usually involved. General Giap used the same methods at Dien Bien Phu...encircle and assault by superior numbers no matter how many died...the PAVN had little care for their soldiers' lives.That we were 'right' about the people some of them anyway was demonstrated after the war ended when the VietNamese government exterminated many thousands some say over 100000 Montagnards. Montagnards were usually allied with Special Forces units as the movie clearly shows.The American military did not 'lose' the conflict at all  it was given away by politicians. Simply check the casualty numbers. The ignominy lay in the submission by 'President Cronkite' on national TV.There are other elements in the pot but those don't matter much.I watch The Green Berets in 2 parts. The first part is totally realistic as far as the crude effects would permit. I overlook the technical failures. The second part is really not credible at all but it is kind of fun in a way. Such a snatch mission would take weeks to arrange and that requirement is not addressed in the movie. It just happens as if it were undertaken in the next few days.While I have versions of Apocalypse Now and its Redux I do not have other Vietnam war movies such as Platoon an aberration The Deer Hunter preposterous Hamburger Hill stumbling or Full Metal Jacket another aberration although I have subjected myself to having watched them all at one time or another.I watch The Green Berets for another chance to get mad at Maltin and other speculators who were not out there and do not understand at all. I watch it with Closed Captions I started using CC about 6 years ago and I find it enriches my movie watching experience but The Green Berets is rather poorly captioned. I complained to the captioning company and suggested they use an experienced person to at least CHECK the 'technical' terminology. For example fougasse is called boo gas the commo bunker is called the como bunker Colonel Kirby's Mike Force is called a Might Force and there are all kinds of captions for Fong which is NOT a VietNamese name Pham or Phon maybe among other booboos.With some reservations I recommend The Green Berets for the first part of it and the general tone of its Point Of View which represents the prevailing notion in both the government and the military at that time.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Green Berets has received a lot of flack over the years a lot of it undeserved. I admit there's a lot about the movie that doesn't work  the tone and attitude of the movie is from the 1940s not 1969. The subplot about the war orphan is cliched and heavyhanded. The movie was shot in an area that looks nothing like Vietnam. There are some weird attempts at humor. And yes Wayne didn't have a clear idea as to what the Vietnam conflict was about.Most of the controversy about this movie comes around this fact. However looking carefully one sees that not all of the politics are incorrect. The scene at the beginning for example makes clear that soldiers of ANY conflict are just following orders from the government. If you disagree with a conflict blame the government not the soldiers.Also in the beginning the movie makes a point that the Soviets were giving assistance to the SouthEast communists  which was true. Wayne's statement suggesting that the Soviets were trying for some kind of world domination actually isn't that farfetched. Before the Soviet Union fell there were numerous times when the Soviets gave assistance to other communist countries and forces. As well this short beginning scene has most of the politics in the entire movie!Some of the protests about the movie are to do with the fact that the North Vietnamese are portrayed as being vicious and the Americans as a kind of holierthanthou. While it is true that the Americans committed some atrocities during the conflict the North Vietnamese committed FAR MORE. The scene in the movie where innocent Vietnamese villagers are killed by the enemy because they accepted help from the Americans has actual basis in fact. Still not convinced exhippies? If the North Vietnamese weren't so bad why were there thousands of boat people? And take a look at the basedontruestories movies The Hanoi Hilton and The Killing Fields to get an idea of how brutal the SouthEast Asian communists were to P.O.W.s and ordinary people.The Green Berets also has some excellent battle sequences. In fact Wayne was so impressed with secondunit director Kellogg's direction of these scenes he gave him codirecting credit. I will admit that the shot with the toy helicopter did ruin things somewhat. Elsewhere however the military hardware and battle techniques are overall very accurate. Wayne got full cooperation from the U.S. militaryYou might think I like this movie. Actually I don't  I overall didn't like it because it was too slow and with a lot of boring chat. Still I don't think it's anywhere near the bomblaughfest it's been unfairly branded. And I think a lot of people agree It was the 11th highest grossing movie of 1968 generating 8.7 million in rentals  a HUGE amount in those days! It's also been issued several times on video and Warner Bros. chose this movie as one of its first oldies DVD releases. So clearly a lot of people haven't minded  or didn't care  about its message.".

Viewers who criticize this film for not having a meaning or realism miss its point.  This was John Wayne giving support to the troops the best way he knew how by making a patriotic John Wayne movie. Nobody ever criticized Bob Hope for entertaining the troops so why pan the Duke for doing the same? This movie was no more borish or weak than the Saturday morning serials we used to cheer in the 30s 40s and 50s. If you want a deeper message see The Searchers and if you look closely you WILL see some parallels...North Vietnam and the VC had great PR throughout the warthey managed to dupe most of the world into believing they were peace loving victims of Western imperialism. For some reason the press never focussed on their use of cold terror and outright mass murder to force their aims on the people of RVN. People forget that we were not in Vietnam to save Vietnam we were there to stem the tide of world wide communist expansion.  We didn't lose in 1975 we won in 1989 when the Wall came down.So John Wayne's The Green Berets was a little schmaltzy. Warm beer tastes flat but better than no beer. The actors' roles on both sides were caricatures of their respective types.I saw this movie when I was stationed on Okinawa in 1969.  Everyone cheered no one whined.  No civilian I ever met liked it.  So what? Regardless of politics most Americans who served in Southeast Asia did so honorably. This is an honorable movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The liberal reviewers of The Green Berets need to free their minds from all of their 40 yearold irrational hate. The Green Berets is a motion picture film nothing more. Anyone who sees it has the right to exercise their opinion and they are entitled to like or dislike this or any other film. However it is interesting how leftwing reviewers of this film will go to such great lengths to mock and ridicule it.Liberals are quick to point out that John Wayne was not in WWII which is somehow supposed to make him a bad guy because he portrayed soldiers in the movies. Really? Let's look at the reviews of Jane Fonda's films. Oops! it looks like Jane has been portraying decent American citizens for years after she gave hugs  kisses to the Vietcong in Hanoi after they had killed Americans. The Green Berets is routinely viewed under a microscope with hypercritical eyes looking for the slightest continuity error to exploit and exaggerate. It's interesting that The Green Berets and The Hellfighters were two films made backtoback the same year 1968 with a nearly identical cast including John Wayne Bruce Cabbot and Jim Hutton. Both films are action yarns with the only real difference being the enemy. In The Green Berets they fight the Vietcong. In The Hellfighters they fight oil fires. Take a look at the reviews left for The Hellfighters. Most render praise for the acting story and cast noting that it is a worthwhile albeit 40 yearold action film. Considerably different from the vicious and offensive reviews given for The Green Berets to say the least. Is it likely that an ensemble cast used in both films shot only months apart gave bitterly disappointing and ridiculous performances in The Green Berets but then turned out memorable well portrayed and entertaining performances in The Hellfighters? I think it's obvious that the people who bash The Green Berets have a problem with their political agenda not the film or its players. Despite all of the John Wayne and America bashing infiltrated into the reviews for The Green Berets one fact still remains fighting communism was a just and noble undertaking and the film conveys this. If any political system can be measured in a degree of evil communism is at the top of the list. Roughly 4 times as many human lives have been senselessly murdered in the name of communism over those murdered by the Nazis during WWII. If it's okay with the liberals for a war film to show the U.S. fighting Nazis but it's not okay to show them fighting communists their logic is seriously backward. In the case of the war in Vietnam the people who bash The Green Berets should do a little more homework. The U.S. was obligated under treaty to help Vietnam fight a communist uprising. That's why we were there. If the U.S. had broken our treaty agreement and abandoned Vietnam the same people who bash the U.S. for fighting the war today would be bashing the U.S. for leaving the Vietnamese high and dry. Communism in southeast Asia was a very real political economic and military threat. The desire to keep the south free from unwanted communist rule and to keep communism at bay in Southeast Asia in general was a reasonable goal for the U.S. By the time American advisors started to arrive in Vietnam the country had already obtained their independence from France so the U.S. certainly wasn't fighting for France or colonialism. I was alive during the Vietnam War and I remember the mood of the U.S at the time very clearly. Most people supported our troops. Unfortunately 40 years later the only people who are remembered are the war protesters which gives the impression that they were the majority. The Green Berets did not go against the mood of the country it was right in line with the majority. Don't believe it? Take a look at the box office business this film did in 1968. It wasn't a blockbuster but it did very well. Also the theme song Ballad of the Green Berets by Barry Saddler went to number one on the Billboard charts. The paperback book The Green Berets on which the film was loosely based was a nation wide best seller for months. Does anyone believe any of this success could have been achieved with a population who unanimously opposed the U.S. presents in Vietnam? Come on now who are you trying to fool? In recent years it seems film makers feel compelled to portray American soldiers in Vietnam as murders thieves rapists insane or bumbling inept leaders. In the film Platoon every bad thing that ever happened in Vietnam was condensed into the account of a single Army unit. People raved about how great a film it was. The unbelieveability of Platoon was like attributing every criminal act ever committed by an entire mafia family to one single character. It's just absurd and totally ridiculous. And some people call The Green Berets unbelievable!? Clearly a film like Platoon was made for the single purpose of making American soldiers look bad. Pure antiAmerican hate propaganda. The very best thing about The Green Berets is its success. This film has continued to sell well in both video and DVD since the mid 1980's. It sells more home use copies than Platoon and Full Metal Jacket combined. People like this film and that's all that matters but the liberals just can't stand it.".

True of The Alamo and true of The Green Berets.The Duke's problem was simply that he made a World War II film about Vietnam. And he was pilloried for it. I well remember when The Green Berets first came out Renata Adler wrote an absolutely hysterical review of it cursing out the film and its producerstar every name in the book in that well known paper that only prints news fit to print.Even World War II films as well as Vietnam ones done now have the value of some historical perspective if they're done now. For my money Casualties of War is the best film done about Vietnam. The Green Berets is not a great film. It does show however the Viet Cong were not exactly boy scouts something many refuse to acknowledge to this day.The Green Berets is at times more silly than bad. It has some stock characters you see in war films the gruff sergeant Aldo Ray the resourceful scrounger Jim Hutton the kindly doctor Raymond St. Jacques. The Vietnamese besides the Viet Cong are represented by George Takei and Jack Soo. Soo who I first saw on Broadway in Flower Drum Song has that disarming deadpan delivery that works great for comedy but not really well in a serious role.In fact Soo is part of what was the silliest part of The Green Berets the capture of a defecting South Vietnamese General who gets entrapped by an Oriental Mata Hari. Irene Tsu is the temptress here in a story that had to have been lifted from Terry and the Pirates back in the day. Someone should have been asking why a general was defecting from the South Vietnamese cause.George Takei is a grim and hating South Vietnamese Captain. I met George Takei at a Star Trek convention several years ago and asked him about the film and John Wayne. He kind of sidestepped the question about the film Oriental players didn't exactly have too much choices in roles. However he did say that working with John Wayne was an experience and he liked the fact that there was no pretense about him. You always knew exactly where you stood with the Duke.Vietnam like Iraq today was a story of culture clash. Americans and the west view the world quite differently than these people. Somewhere along the line we'd all better learn to get along. Maybe when we're faced with beings from another world all of our religious and sociopolitical differences will melt away. I hope so because I suspect that Renata Adler didn't have any more clue to what made John Wayne tick than the Duke had about Vietnam.".

Perhaps the movie's biggest problem in hindsight is the fact that it was made while the Viet Nam War was still being waged. 1979's Apocalypse Now presented the viewer with an inability to filter any kind of rationality out of insane circumstances and challenged one's perception about war and it's consequences. In 1986 Platoon examined the utter insanity that drives men to do the kinds of things they would never even consider in 'ordinary' life. The Green Berets delivers a proactive message about America's involvement in the War as a force for good against the Communist threat posed by Russia China and the Viet Cong. That man has to pay a price for freedom is a recurring theme with the character of Chronicle Herald reporter Beckworth David Janssen gradually coming to realize that all is not black or white when serving in a combat zone. However viewed today the film appears to be laden with clichd characters and situations and doesn't convey the kind of mind numbing angst that warriors in combat are faced with when fighting the enemy. With all that's been said and written about the Viet Nam War the movie's principal value lies in presenting a view of the conflict that's generally not seen or understood by those who never lived through the era.".

	schema:reviewBody "Very good documentary about the working conditions of five groups of workers. Even though it's the twentyfirst century the director wants us to know that a lot of workers across the world have not benefited from the advancement in technology. First we're off to Ukraine to learn about the work of some coal miners. Their work conditions are just unbelievable. Then the director brings us to Indonesia to show us the hard work done by the sulfur miners I didn't know nothing about this line of work. We are then transported to Pakistan where we are shown the work of shipbreakers. Again I was unaware that ship cemetaries of this sort still existed today. The open slaughterhouse of a Nigerian city is next. Animal activists beware don't watch! I was just fascinated by the chaos that seems to reign in that place. Finally we are shown the working conditions in the steel industry of China. All those segments are presented without real context. There's no narration. But it's easy to follow to get the point. And the images say a thousand words. Beautiful cinematography and very good camera movement. Some times the camera moves with the subject Some times subject and camera are not moving. It's like a photo shot. One thing is for sure you always feel like you're in the middle of the action. Even though you see the despair you can also see hope in what most of these workers say. Watch it. It's a great eyeopener.Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival at the Cumberland Cinemas on September 17th 2005.87100 ".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. After you see this film you'll never complain about your job again. Subtitled something like Five Portraits of Work in the TwentyFirst Century Glawogger's documentary features some of the most dangerous difficult or just plain unpleasant work in the world.Each segment except the last one is about twentyfive minutes long and is shot without any voiceover narration and very little editorializing. We are simply presented with people working and talking about their work. The director possesses a very painterly sense of composition and we're often presented with shots of workers posing as if they were in front of a still camera. The camerawork is even more impressive when it is moving and I often found myself wondering how they were able to film in some of these conditions.The segments follow in order a group of miners in Ukraine who have dug their own coal shafts a group of men in Indonesia who collect sulfur from an active volcano and haul it down the mountainside butchers at an openair slaughterhouse in Nigeria men who break apart rusting ships for scrap metal in Pakistan and steelworkers in China. Although all of these workers are merely surviving the thing that struck me most was how contented even happy most of them were.That being said three of the five segments featured Islamic societies and I found myself wondering about the connections between the conditions these men were working in and the rise of Islamic radicalism. Among the shipbreakers in Pakistan for instance there was an interesting segment which followed a photographer who circulated among the men charging them a fee to take pictures of them holding an assault rifle. There was no voiceover but I got the impression that these men wanted to be seen as revolutionaries instead of just subsistence scrap workers.The most intense segment had to be among the butchers and there was quite a lot of blood and gore evident as we watched the men work. But strangely I found this a more honest approach to the production of food than I saw in the factory farms in a film like We Feed The World. These butchers are handson literally.The final segment filmed among steelworkers in China was the shortest and the least interesting but the director was trying to end with the optimism of the Chinese workers for the steel industry which he contrasts with shots of a defunct steel mill in Germany that's been turned into an art installation. His point was slightly unclear but overall his unflinching eye for detail even in some harrowing work environments makes this documentary a must see.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival.Workingman's Death by Michael Glawogger is a documentary in the basest sense of the word in that it simply presents five stories of workers around the world working in dangerous backbreaking physical labour without any narration or obvious context other than what is shown.The film shows miners in the Ukraine working an abandoned coal mine in unbelievably claustrophobic conditions. It then moves to sulphur miners in Indonesia collecting sulphur from active volcanic vents. Next is an openair slaughterhouse in Nigeria that processes goats and cattle. Then come shipbreakers in Pakistan who cut apart old ships for scrap. And finally steel workers in China are shown before the film ends in a former foundry now park in Germany.The film is adept at showing the extremely difficult and threatening conditions people have to work in usually for little money or simply to survive. The scenes in Nigeria were especially interesting to watch showing the interplay between all the people in the market each with their own specific job the images are also quite graphic.However the Nigerian segment does seem out of step with the rest of the movie in that it didn't seem to be especially dangerous as per the title of the film but rather just physically demanding. Part of the reason for this is described in the QA below.Glawogger wanted to close the film at the abandoned foundry in Germany to show the future and where things were going but I didn't necessarily feel the film lead to that. If anything what I got was that even in the 21st century with all the technology and progress that has been made physical labour and heavy industry is still a big part of work around the world and that is not going to go away anytime soon especially with the way the world economy works today.Still the images he shows on screen are pretty powerful and do communicate a real sense of the work people environment and the sheer effort in each locale.Michael Glawogger attended the screening and was present for a QA after the film  When asked while the segment in China was so short compared to the other segments in the film Glawogger replied that it was the last segment shot and he decided to make it short to transition to the epilogue in Germany. He felt he had shown enough of the sensual part of work in the other parts. In China he found a strong belief that the future is bright akin to Europe after World War II and that led into the German segment which shows where the future is ending.Someone asked how Glawogger managed to get John Zorn to score the film Glawogger replied that he simply asked.Glawogger was asked how he managed to gain access to his subjects he said it was patience i.e. the normal documentary process where you spend time with people make friends and they soon open up. He spent time every day with his subjects which showed them he was serious about his work which caused them to take him seriously. He spent about three weeks to a month in each location with the exception of China where the government takes a dim view of foreigners spending that much time in their foundries talking to their workers which I guess may also account for the shorter length of that segment of the film.When asked what he learned Glawogger said he was surprised by the diversity of the situations. For example at first glance the Nigerian openair slaughterhouse looks horrible like an inferno but it's not really like that and in fact the people there are the happiest of anyone shown in the movie.There is no overall message about the meaning of life or anything like that in the film but rather little things in each place.It was a long process to choose the industries he wanted to show. He started with old worker heroes from the Soviet Union which led him to the coal miners in the Ukraine. He also knew that he wanted to end in the park in Germany. He originally went to Nigeria to examine the oil workers but instead became fascinated by the slaughterhouse instead which may account for the slightly outofplace feel to this segment relative to the other sections.Production costs were quite high for this documentary at least by European standards it cost about 2 million to make.".

It's a moving testament to the strength and resiliency of human beings who manage to find a sense of purpose and even pride in the sheer act of survival under the most difficult circumstances.Workingman's Death is an eyeopening experience that takes the viewer into some of the worst working conditions in the world an illegal coal mine in Ukraine a slaughterhouse in Nigeria a sulfur mine in Indonesia and a shipbreaking yard in Pakistan. The film starkly portrays these harsh settings and the mostly men who toil within them. There is no expert testimony no voiceovers no narrator only the men themselves who do the work. The camera follows them as they carry out their tasks take breaks and go home after a hard day. The only commentary is from the workers themselves talking about their jobs.The film is an intimate portrait of how these workers keep their spirits intact through all of this back breaking labor. The Ukrainian coal miners see themselves as heroes carrying on the legacy of the oncegreat Soviet coal machine. In Indonesia a rabblerouser comes to the sulfur mine for work and amidst his dangerous and physically grueling work shoots the breeze with his coworkers about prostitutes and bar brawls. A worker in the Nigerian slaughterhouse says that his job cleaning the severed heads of cows makes him special because he has skills that other workers don't have. The workers at the shipbreaking yard in Pakistan consider themselves part of a brotherhood they look out for the fellow workers and pull together to help a friend in trouble.In Workingman's Death we see the will of people to carry on. The workers in this film are oppressed people but they refuse to think of themselves as slaves. They find pride brotherhood and even humor in their work no matter how dire the circumstances. The cinematography is beautiful the music haunting. Never before has hard work been more artfully portrayed.The film features graphic footage of animal slaughter and the segment on the Nigerian slaughterhouse will be especially disturbing to many people. Unfortunately it's the graphic nature of this film that will probably prevent from getting wide release at least in the US. This is a shame because this is a film that can remind us all of our common humanity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Workingman's Death is a difficult movie to review. The first segment about Ukranians mining coal from small illegal mines in one of the coldest most remote spots on the planet is fascinating. We follow these hard workers on their journey to and from the mines. We visit the home of a miner and meet his wife and the family a baby goat and the entire segment was delightful. Next we travel to Indonesia and see some incredible footage of men extracting sulfur from the mountains and this too is something that you have probably never seen before. There are some very funny moments as well and this story was also a winner.What I found much less compelling were the final two stories about Pakistanis taking apart giant ships no longer being used and an obsolete power plant in China that has been turned into a park. Unique...yes. Interesting...not really.The ugliness came in the form of a segment about workers in Nigeria. Honestly if I knew about this beforehand there is zero chance that I would have attended this screening. It begins with animal horns being tossed onto a large pile and then we see several large animals being led to an area. At this point my sensors were activated. I was saying to myself...please Godlet this be some sort of African rodeo...but when I heard voices shouting and the subtitles read INNARDS..SKIN...INNARDS! I bolted out of the theater at record speed. The bloodbath apparently continued for about 25 minutes. Since I didn't witness this horror show here is the description in the festival program guide A purer form of hell is found in a Nigerian slaughter yard where the bleating animals graphically portrayed seem more human than the men and women killing portioning roasting sellingand praying. Allrighty then! Now at least you know that this isn't going to be the feel good hit of the summer...In the Q and A following the film director Michael Glawogger was quite charming in talking about his work. Someone asked if it will be seen on television. Glawogger was hopeful saying that he expected that it would eventually make it to the small screen. I can tell you with absolute certainty that this will NEVER be seen on American television in any way shape or form unless the Nigerian segment is deleted.A DVD will probably be released in the future and until then Workingman's Death will enjoy a limited release in the U.S.".

I can't say it's better than the original because you can't have the second film without the first one.  Meaning that this film does not stand on it's own you need the first film to understand the characters and backstories of everything in this film. But all in all I think Rocky II is slightly more enjoyable than the original Rocky.In all honesty I think this film is better directed than the first film. The story seems to flow quite nicely and is slightly faster paced than the original.  Not only that but the main fight in the film is much more exciting and longer.The acting in Rocky II is better as well or at least I thought so. Sylvester Stallone does a fantastic job with his role of Rocky Balboa and really struts his stuff here.  Talia Shire and Burt Young also pull off nice performances.  Carl Weathers plays the character of Apollo Creed to a T.  And of course Burgess Meredith does a fantastic job as Mickey.This is one of those sequels that truly has the same feel as the original. Granted it isn't as fresh as the original...but it's a rematch that can't be missed.  If you liked the original Rocky then you definitely ought to check this one out I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I hope you like the film as much as I do.  Thanks for readingLebowskiT1000".

I'm not so sure. 'Rocky' came along at just the right time  it was an uplifting story and people needed that back then. Now 'Taxi Driver' is usually considered the superior of the two  but they're entirely different and in my opinion and it's a rare one 'Rocky' is just as good  but in a different way. They're both great films and I'm not saying that 'Taxi Driver' shouldn't have won  but I'm not necessarily saying it should have either. 'Rocky's' achievement is monumental and it is one of the greatest films ever made. To say it's 'not as good' merely because it is more optimistic is nonsense.So what's so great about 'Rocky II' and why is it generally underrated? Its average user score right now on the Internet Movie Database  with over 8000 votes  is a measly 6.210 compared to the original's 7.7Because it maintains the focus of the first film and continues the story rather well. A story that didn't really need to be continued per se but nevertheless formed the foundation of one of the greatest film franchises of all time. That's right  many people hate the 'Rocky' sequels but apart from 'Part V' they're all surprisingly entertaining  and more importantly well made. I like them they entertain me and I think they all serve their purpose.What's particularly interesting about 'Rocky II' is that apart from repeating the central theme of fighting Apollo Creed Carl Weathers Rocky Stallone goes through a character arc here that many sequels totally ignore  we see the aftereffects of his fight and him struggling to adapt to the 'New Life.' Rocky is not a smart person. But he is one of cinema's deepest characters. Stallone who wrote all the scripts and directed three of the sequels succeeds at evolving Rocky's selfconfidence. After winning a small fortune from his famous fight with Creed he goes out on an impulsive shopping spree buying a cool car a new leather jacket with a tiger  the beast with the 'eye' that Rocky recaptures in 'Part III'  printed on the back and a new luxurious apartment for him and his wife Adrienne Talia Shire.The problem is that Rocky soon runs out of money. His happygolucky personality crashes when he is faced with the prospect of losing it all. He promised Adrienne never to fight again and keeps his word by trying to get a 'real' job at the meatprocessing factory the same one he trained at in the original film. However due to staff cut backs he is fired and soon realizes that he was born for one reason To fight. Meanwhile Apollo is eager to take on 'The Italian Stallion' again  to prove he isn't the coward that criticizers are implying he is. He entices Rocky back into the ring for a final match  and to say that the outcome is satisfactory is an understatement.Most people seem to forget that Stallone is almost solely responsible for the entire success of 'Rocky' as a whole. He came up with the idea wrote a script fought to get it made fought to become the leading star and literally fought to get in shape. All of this fighting paid off  and it continued to pay off as he kept on cranking out all the sequels.Indeed the 'Rocky' legacy is often poked fun at because it is the typical endless Hollywood moneymaking franchise. But 'Rocky II' and 'III' more so than the other two sequels have guts power determination and focus  they've got the socalled 'Eye of the Tiger' and I can't really say that I agree with anyone who says these movies are worthless. They aren't masterpieces but they certainly aren't trash either. I give 'Rocky II' a hearty recommendation  it's a truly solid sequel that surprises us right when we expect to be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rocky is truly one of the greatest films ever made. So a sequel to this film would have a tough time following it. Rocky 2 does a great job following up Rocky and is truly a great film.The story starts up right where Rocky left off. Rocky goes to the hospital and has surgery and it is revealed that further fighting could damage his eye badly and make him go blind possibly. So Rocky settles down marries Adrian and starts making commercials. Soon Adrian gets pregnant. However soon his ability to not read well costs him his job making commercials and Rocky struggles to find another job. Elsewhere Apollo Creed is furious that so many people are criticizing him for going 15 rounds with a guy who came off that street. So Apollo wants a rematch. Rocky decides that he must fight again which upsets Adrian due to the health risks he may face.This film succeeds mainly due to the fact that it does a great job continuing the Rocky saga. It starts right up after Rocky and further continues the story. It is an awesome follow up. All of the characters are further developed. Apollo Creed is shown more and his character is expanded the most and you get to see what he is like more. Carl Weathers does a great job with Creed in this episode and really plays the upset athlete at the media well. Paulie takes a back seat in this film for the most part but Adrian is very significant in this film as she is the main reason why Rocky is so reluctant to get back in the ring.Rocky 2 is really funny more so than the first one. Love how Rocky goes around trying to get a job despite the fact that he has basically no education. Also humorous is how bad Rocky is at reading cue cards and what he chooses to talk about at his press conference with Apollo. For the most part Rocky and Rocky 2 are more funny than the next films mainly because of how Rocky becomes civilized in Rocky 3 and loses his sense of humor in some ways.The training that ROcky does in this film is epic. Love the training that he goes through in this film slamming metal chasing chickens and hopping around with lumber on his shoulders. Rocky really works hard training in this film my personal favorite of his films in how he trains.No film is perfect though. The Gonna FLy Now song is not the same as it is in the first film. It is not sung by the same people who sang it is the first film so it is not nearly as good. However this song is only used when Rocky is running not when he is doing his other training. They use the Going the Distance song when he is doing his training outside of his running which is fine.Also the fight at the end of the film is not nearly as good as the fight in the first film. It is mainly just Rocky getting pounded relentlessly and having to overcome a superior athlete. Not like in the first film where it is an even fight for the most part.A great sequel that is funny further expands the story and characters and has some really great and memorable moments. A must see and easily the second best film of the series.".

Differences? We've already met all the characters. Gone is the sense of discovery the sense of learning who these people are. We already know don't we? Yet Stallone's characters are sufficiently interesting enough for us to want to spend more time with them seeing them in a world most of us don't know living a life few of us would really want.

In Rocky we have to accept that a nobody unrated club fighter could a get the chance to fight the world champion. B He could possibly defy all odds and go the distance. That's a huge stretch only possible in Hollywood movies classifying the first movie as a fairy tale along the lines of Cinderella.Soap operaesquire is not a bad way to characterize Rocky II because of the emotional ride but I don't find it as trite as a soap opera. Rocky's actions are very believable from his earnings feeling like a fortune to him when they were obviously not to his illiteracy and his unsophisticated punch drunk boxer. The ramifications of his past are believable. He fritters away the money and is unable to capitalize on his 15 minutes of fame. Hey it happens all the time. Very believable.With a pregnant wife no job and no way to pay his bills he's backed into a corner. What's a fighter to do? And in this case I mean a fighter in its most literal sense. He's willing to risk his health and even his marriage to do what any man should do provide for his family.Adrian's bit of drama is the single problem with the movie but it's also the heart of the movie. It's not a movie about losing it all and coming back again it's much more than that. It's about a simple man who's trying to do the best he can with the only tools he has. And when Adrian is first to go down for the count it puts it all in jeopardy.It's not until his wife is ready to accept him as he is for what he is that he can continue his quest one more fight for his family for himself.The story arc feels so similar to the first movie that this one is often tossed to the side yet it truly is amazing how Stallone managed to reimagine all the magic of the first movie and better still give us a second helping of it that's just as sweet.

As the money fades he finds personal crisis is never far away and is tempted into a big money rematch against Creed.  Meanwhile Creed who should fight other fighters is plagued by suggestions that the first fight was staged to go the distance.  Things build to the rematch.Stallone proves that he has got a money making brain in his head by basically remaking Rocky.  The story covers similar themes  it's a soap opera with a fight at the end.  Here the soapy mush is mostly about his loss of money and decline back into the gutter while we have children and comas thrown in for good measure.  This is all well and good and Stallone doesn't let it get too mushy.  The script has some good scenes and mixes in comedy  my favourtie line being where Rocky is advised to invest his money in condominiums to which Rocky replies condominiums? But I don't use them.'This comedy helps endear Rocky to us despite being a bit punchy'.  The fight however  that's where the money is.  As in the first Rocky movie the fight is a huge thing full of emotion and welling music.  The fighting is of course nonsense  even sillier than the first film but with the raw emotion and use of music you can't help but get involved  even if you don't want to!  At times it goes a bit far and may look a bit like egomassaging by Stallone eg the scene where he is out on his training run and is followed by hundreds of supportive children!Stallone is good in all his roles the playing of Rocky as a working class bum made good is bang on.  Shire doesn't have much to do but she's good beside Stallone.  Young is good and Meredith easily repeats his tourdeforce as the grizzled trainer.  Carl Weathers is good as Apollo Creed and this is one of his best roles.Overall this isn't a classic but by repeating the basic formula of the first movie and taking Rocky back to the gutter this remains an entertaining soap that is driven by mushy if formulaic emotion.".

This soaper on the ring is developed in gentleness dignity  feelgood style such as the initial outing. Spectacular and climatic final bout including slowmoving images. Writerdirectoractor Stallone new entry is surprisingly entertaining and packs good feeling. Usual and nostalgic musical score by Bill Conti and atmospheric cinematography Bill Butler. The motion picture is lavishly financed by the producers complete saga Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler and well directed by Stallone who along with John G Avildsen made the six Rocky.While here the opponent is an invincible young boxerchamp of the world in subsequent entries the contenders were the following  Rocky III against corpulent Mr T from A Team Rocky IV against a massive Russian boxer played by Dolph Lundgren and Rock 5 against an ingrate young fighter who he trained played by Tommy Morrison and Rocky Balboa proving his estranged young son Milo Ventiglimia who still can fight. Rating  Good  being impossible to dislike the result is deliciously corny agreeable and predictable amusement .

	schema:reviewBody "Three years after the Academy Award winning success of Rocky Sylvester Stallone reprises his role as the heavyweight boxer in Rocky II which he writes and directs this time around. Picking up right where the first film left off Rocky II follows Rocky Balboa as he starts to adapt to family life after barely losing his match to Apollo Creed and then marrying his girlfriend Adrian. However the adjustment to this new much softer and simpler life isn't easy especially while Apollo Creed continually harasses Rocky for a rematch as he is hungry for the knockout rather than just the winning score. Rocky must then make a choice does he stay retired from boxing or does he train to take on Apollo Creed once more? Rocky II despite what die hard fans of the first film might say is actually pretty good. It doesn't have the raw visceral emotion behind it that fueled the fire for the original but as far as sequels go it's really a decent film. It works really well as a continuation of Rocky's story and it makes for a worthwhile addition to the first film. It's a lot of fun to see Stallone and Weathers reprise their roles as Rocky and Apollo and getting an extra dosage of some great boxing is really exciting. Rocky II while devoid of the visceral poetry of the first film is pretty darn good.It's not without a few problems of course. It's a much more watered down and predictable story than what we received in the first film. From the beginning we can see where the story is going and while entertaining it's not surprising and lacks the wow factor of the first film. The character of Rocky also changes a bit. He becomes softer in this film and at times a caricature of the fabulous underdog protagonist Stallone established him as in the first film. He's a little goofy at times and not as enjoyable as a character as he was in the first film. It's still great to see him get back in the ring but it's not quite the same as the original.But despite no wonder and power in the story it's still really fun and Rocky II is plenty enjoyable to watch. If you liked the first film then I would definitely recommend watching the sequel as it's just more great Rocky Balboa action and a pleasant continuation of the story. It's not as fantastic as the first film but worth two hours of your time.".

There are a lot of movies that try to be tear jerkers and try to be the feel good movie...i really believe that was never Stallone's intention it just naturally happened. Both endings in Rocky 1  2 have been the only movies in my entire life that have made me cry..ya that's right cry!! I watched it again last night and once again tears. It's really unbelievable!! It's a real shame that this movie doesn't have a better rating. Anyways if you have a chance watch the movie again...maybe you'll see what i mean.His lungs i'm gonna punch out!!".

	schema:reviewBody "You've got to agree with Leonard Maltin when he calls this film more of a remake than a sequel. But that doesn't mean ROCKY II fails to make for some fantastic crowdpleasing entertainment! Sly is back as The Italian Stallone having just taken the beating of his life from barelyvictorious Heavyweight champ Apollo Creed Carl Weathers. For medical reasons and for new wife Adrian our lovable lunkhead attempts a life that doesn't involve black eyes and punching bags but it's tough out d'ere. Meanwhile Creed is throwing a hissy fit because he took such a walloping from an unknown Philly product. If you don't know where this is going there's a good chance you too have recently been in the ring with Creed!No one has ever argued that ROCKY II is as good as the original but it's not exactly thousands of miles behind either. Picking up in the immediate aftermath of the original the viewer is immediately sucked right back into Rock's world. We already know him so well. Whereas in the original he was all about boxing here Rocky is forced to start a new life making for an interesting fishoutofwater scenario. We all know he's going back to the ring but writerdirector Stallone keeps us guessing as to how.The single biggest strength of the film is the amazing finale which actually outdoes the big fight from the original. The audience can't help but make pained faces as Rocky takes one of the most brutal beatings ever filmed. Punch after powerful punch it often seems completely hopeless for him. It's also worth noting that Stallone and indeed the entire case is as likable as ever.On the flip side the biggest weaknesses are the sporadic slowmoving moments. In particular Adrian's birthinduced coma is just a tad contrived and out of place. This traumatic event was presumably included to give Rocky and the audience a stronger thirst for victory. Truth be told Stallone didn't have to go that far the birth of Rocky Jr. was more than enough dramatic inspiration. I'm willing to bet if Sly had it to do over again he'd scratch the coma.This is one of those rare films that is so good you forget about or forgive its minimal flaws. Often degraded as the black sheep of the series ROCKY II is surprisingly effective with Stallone the actor writer and director in great form. Highly recommended for all filmgoers.".

The first fight was spectacular but both fighters feel empty after it. So a rematch is born! Apollo pushes for it and Rocky would grab it immediately only his wife is stopping him. The thing I like about this film is that in many scenes it feels real. Many of its characters feel real. Actually I cannot think of anyone there who doesn't fit into the real world. Even the loud mouth Apollo Creed is credible he acts as the world champion. And he looks fit. I don't think I remember a boxing film where one of the fighters looks this fit. Hats of to Weathers for that. The relationship between Rocky and his wife can be felt by the audience and I will give credit to Stallone for this because I think he is not the top of the lot when it comes to drama acting but he found his spot here and he played it well.The sequels which followed where bordering with comedy so I think the first two films make a nice combination of sports drama and action.".

It's as poignant as the doorway framing scenes in 'The Searchers' and rather subtle.Another scene is the family in the air raid shelter undergoing a bombing attack. The claustrophobia of the situation and the bravery and dignity of the powerless family caught there is focused by a single point of view. The unspoken fear is on the face of Garson vocalised by the kids who finally awake as the bombardment increases. Long simple takes perfectly capture the intense atmosphere and exceptional acting.When I was young I never appreciated this art of 'invisible' filmmaking and just why such directors as William Wyler or Preston Sturges or Billy Wilder do such a good job without you even noticing.

	schema:headline " A film which justifies its status as a major classic.";
	schema:reviewBody "It must be over 50 years since I first saw this classic film and for some reason I never watched it again until recently. To do so was an interesting experience  reliving many memories of the war years which I mostly spent in London. I think the reason why there was such a long interval before I decided to watch it again was a subconscious recognition that it was produced at a time of crisis largely for political reasons and a feeling this was unduly evident in the screenplay. Mrs. Miniver was released a few months after Pearl Harbour at a time when many U.S. citizens wondered why their country should be expending its efforts fighting in Europe when it was Japan which had attacked them  The film was quite clearly written produced and directed with the objective of answering this question. Winston Churchill has made it clear that he regarded the release of this film as one of the biggest single contributions made to the allied war effort worth in his words a flotilla of destroyers and it is hard today not to regard the film as primarily a piece of patriotic propaganda. However the deft and capable direction of William Wyler and the almost uniformly great acting by the cast particularly Greer Garson as Mrs. Miniver go a very long way towards concealing the fact that one is viewing a film with a message and few would deny that the Oscars it won were thoroughly deserved. Mrs. Miniver certainly earns its place on any short list of film classics.There are of course already many comments on this film in the database I would have been reluctant to add any more but for the realization that people of my age who lived in England during the war are becoming increasingly few and our comments  which must have a rather different perspective to those of younger generations  will not continue to be available for very much longer. Many of the very fine sequences in this film have already been reviewed more than adequately by others and I will not comment further on them but two sequences which I found particularly evocative were the call on amateur sailors to help evacuate the British army from Dieppe and the pub scene where the locals were listening to the British traitor Lord Haw Haw broadcasting from Germany and telling his listeners how futile any further resistance would be. In stating this I am simply confirming that for such documentary type films people who lived through the events depicted will assess the film on the basis of their personal memories rather than on their cinematographic quality. Ultimately both on its first viewing and when viewing it again a few days ago I found that for me watching Mrs. Miniver was irritating because it inevitably showed an American view of life as it was in England. Numerous very small points indicated that we were seeing a glimpse of middle class English life through American eyes. Whilst as an English born viewer I found this irritating it did not in any way detract from the primary purpose of the film in showing Americans what life in wartime Britain was really like and why their involvement in the war in Europe was so vital. Ultimately I had to accept that this was a great film which well deserves its classic status.".

Knowing Greer Garson who I considered the antiCrawford starred in it gave me more of an excuse.I finally watched it as film homework and loved it.  It's about an uppermiddleclass English family although most of the American actors are terrible holding their accents and their experience in the early years of World War II.A swiftlymoving storyline takes us from the complacency of peace through air raids Dunkirk and tragedy.  No one is a superhero but decent people who understand they must put aside their personal concerns and do what must be done to fight for their country and freedom.  No one preaches except the minister and he only rarely.Of course it being England there's time for a flower show and being a movie there's a romance WWII was not kind to Theresa Wright's characters however.The film's remarkable pacing is one of its great highlights.  Long transitions are covered in the merest of hints a comment that a servant has departed for example.  Yet there's time for powerful lengthy scenes such as that of the Minivers holed up in a crude bomb shelter with their two young children away from their storybook home.  Despite the increasingly hellish crash of bombs and bullets they try to chat about knitting and such.  But soon the fear builds to an unbearable climax and the family desperately clings to one another.The acting is generally superb and much of the story is told through silent shots of the stars rather than dialog.  Few moments are as touching as the shot of the glowing young wife seeing her husband off to war admiring his courage contrasted by the barely hidden fear and maturity of the mother.You can nitpick the movie has many of the conventional stylistic hallmarks of the period.

Coming at a time of heightened emotions  as well as being expertly produced and extremely well acted  it is easy to see why the film earned 6 Oscars including Best Picture  Best Director.Greer Garson is completely marvelous in the title role for which she won the Best Actress Oscar presenting a portrait of grace  courage under fire which transcends mere acting. She is representing an entire island full of women who grew the crops  ran the factories and kept the nation operating while the men went to battle. Through her wonderful performance Garson shows how those she symbolized more than did their part in the fight against the Axis.Two other ladies give outstanding performances in the film. As the local aristocrat Dame May Whitty is properly imperious  proud yet the viewer sees her character unbend over the course of the film to become much more vulnerable. Winning the Best Supporting Actress Oscar lovely Teresa Wright is luminous as Dame May's granddaughter. Sweetly sensible elegantly at ease joyous during hardships Miss Wright gives a performance not easy to forget.In solid understated roles both Walter Pidgeon as Mr. Miniver  Richard Ney as his elder son supply good support to the ladies in the cast. Pidgeon gets to pilot one of the Little Boats to Dunkirk and Ney becomes a flyer with the RAF but both are performed in an almost subdued manner leaving the heroics to the women.A quintet of fine actors add small deft brushstrokes to the movie's canvas cherubic Henry Travers as the stationmaster who delights in the gentle art of breeding roses blustery Reginald Owen as the local storekeeper who eagerly takes over as air raid warden kindly Henry Wilcoxon as the village vicar blunt Rhys Williams as the boyfriend of the Miniver's maid comically played by Brenda Forbes and Helmut Dantine as the pitiless German pilot who briefly invades the Miniver household.Sixyearold Christopher Severn will either delight or annoy as the Miniver's talkative infant son. Clare Sandars as his slightly older sister is left something of a cipher by the script.Movie mavens should recognize Ian Wolfe uncredited as a boatman helping with the Dunkirk rescue.The scenes involving the brutal aerial bombardment are still vividly suspenseful focusing primarily on the faces of the actors involved.".

	schema:headline " Simply beautiful";
	schema:reviewBody "I've seen this film several times now and despite knowing what occurs the beauty never wears off.The film is aesthetically lovely thanks to William Wyler's low key yet attentive and detailed style. The characters act naturally something oft times missing in older films that lean to be more stylized. The acting is incredible in this film and something many a modern film would do well to copy. Greer Garson is the portrait of strength beauty and dignity as Mrs. Miniver in a brilliantly played role. Yet it's the substance that stays with you. The film is telling a story about people and a time in history and it's simple because it allows itself to be.

	onyx:emotionText "I've seen this film several times now and despite knowing what occurs the beauty never wears off.The film is aesthetically lovely thanks to William Wyler's low key yet attentive and detailed style. The characters act naturally something oft times missing in older films that lean to be more stylized. The acting is incredible in this film and something many a modern film would do well to copy. Greer Garson is the portrait of strength beauty and dignity as Mrs. Miniver in a brilliantly played role. Yet it's the substance that stays with you. The film is telling a story about people and a time in history and it's simple because it allows itself to be.

	schema:reviewBody "When a film touches one's own reality it becomes something rather special. For this reason I have long held a deep affection for Wyler's saga of an English family on the home front from the immediate presecond world period to the darkest days of the blitz. It has become very fashionable to sneer at Mrs Miniver as sentimental propaganda long after the events it depicted. Was it really like that? Well  yes and no. The whole was very cleverly orchestrated by a team of four scriptwriters including James Hilton Hollywood's most accomplished director William Wyler MGM's able inhouse composer Herbert Stothart one of their best cameramen Joseph Ruttenburg and a cast when not verging on the caricature giving the nearest semblance to the emotions I can remember living through as a child during those dark days. No one sneered at the time and the film gathered a well deserved collection of Oscars. It was only afterwards that doubts set in and reactions from a new generation became derisory. Looking at it today there are many things that are not quite right but they tend to be minor such as the risibly awful choir at the garden party the maid snivelling to the point of embarrassment the phoney look of American style fencing around those English gardens and the endless digs at class which although part and parcel of how things were were never quite so overstated. Where the work really comes into its own is in its portrayal of human emotions which was always Wyler's trump card. A film that attempts to enshrine that spirit of togetherness that comes to the fore in times of adversity and the fight against a common evil needed a director able to convey with an almost tactile sense of human passion. William Wyler who during his great period from Jezebel in 1938 to Carrie in 1952 depicted the human heart with an intensity that has hardly ever been seen before or since invested his depiction of the British wartime home front with a sincerity that almost completely deflects the arrows of criticism it has so often received. Ask again if it was really like that and I would cite the airraid shelter scene some twothirds of the way through as being in every sense definitive. My mother protected me in just such a way during airraids in South London during the 1940 blitz as do the Miniver parents their children. I remember the crescendo of destructive sounds as depicted in the film as if only yesterday.".

Mrs. Miniver won a host of Oscars including Best Picture Best Actress for Greer Garson Best Supporting Actress for Teresa Wright Best Director for William Wyler all deserved.Forget all the war pictures this film about the trials of a British family just before and during World War II struck a poignant note with the American public. Showing how they were coping with the attacks on their civilian population made every American family identify with the Minivers. If they fail in their resolution to defend their blessed isle we in America could be facing these same trials and depredations.Like the people in The Diary of Anne Frank the Minivers are such ordinary folks caught up in a thing that was not of their making. The film opens with Greer Garson coming home after a shopping trip to London deciding how to tell her husband Walter Pidgeon about a new hat. On the way home the stationmaster Henry Travers asks Garson permission to name a rose he's been cultivating for the flower show the Miniver Rose. Pidgeon's splurged on a new car and he's trying to figure out how to tell Garson.The war comes and the Minivers and all their neighbors in their small country town have to deal with rationing and shortages and then the blitz as the ruling malignancy in Germany seeks to terrorize the British people into submission. As London took it as their Prime Minister said it would so to do the small villages and hamlets especially if they're located next to an RAF base.Which is where their oldest boy Richard Ney is now stationed after having left Oxford. He's involved too with a radiantly beautiful Teresa Wright as the granddaughter of the local grande dame Dame May Witty.Wright is involved in two of my favorite scenes. When she first meets the pretentious Ney and gently but firmly puts him down who could help but fall for this girl. And her final scene with Greer Garson is what I'm convinced got them both Oscars. You have to see it I can't say more and the hardest of hearts will be moved.Pidgeon's moment comes when he's called away because he owns a small boat a cabin cruiser we'd call it and ordered to take it to Ramsbottom. It's the beginning of the greatest citizen mobilization of the last century the evacuation of the British Army from the beach at Dunkirk. He and thousands like him are told what the mission is and they could expect to be under fire at that beach and crossing 40 miles of English Channel. No one flinches and a very nice animated scene at night is showing all of these small crafts filling up the river on a date with history.Garson also comes face to face with Nazism herself as she first is held captive and then turns the tables on a wounded Nazi flier who bailed out played by Helmut Dantine. Don't think all the women in America didn't think about coming face to face with evil right in their kitchens.Both Walter Pidgeon for Best Actor and Henry Travers for Best Supporting Actor got nominations themselves but lost to James Cagney and Van Heflin respectively. In addition Dame May Witty was also up for Best Supporting Actress but lost to her fellow cast member Teresa Wright.The valedictory for the film is delivered by Vicar Henry Wilcoxon after a bad raid in which several cast members are killed. With so much death and destruction waged on them at home it has become the people's war more a people's war than it was even in the United States with so many civilian casualties. We got a taste of it at Pearl Harbor and a much bigger taste on 911 in New York Northern Virginia and on the Pennsylvania countryside. The words of Henry Wilcoxon should be standard reading or viewing. It's what makes Mrs. Miniver such a timeless classic as we deal with another brand of totalitarian malignancy in this century.".

And that's what this movie is really about the love and devotion of ordinary people during wartime.Technically this is a fine film. The script is well written and the plot is easy to follow. Most of the characters are sympathetic and all of them have convincing arcs through the story. I did not care for the very Victorian Lady Beldon but Dame May Witty gives a nice performance in that role. The film's plot has an interesting twist toward the end that coincides with the randomness of the effects of war. The story's tone does drip with a bit of sentimentality. But given the fact that the movie itself was made during the war it portrays I think some sentimentality is entirely appropriate.The film's BW cinematography is conventional but competent. Production design and costumes are credible. And the special effects are surprisingly good for the early 1940s.I will say that the film seems very dated. Customs and manners have changed so much in the last 65 years the behavior of characters in this film is so proper and formal. That's not a criticism just an observation.The 1930s and 40s must have been a truly awful time for peace loving people. It's good therefore that we have highquality films like Mrs. Miniver as a reminder of what life was like for ordinary people to give us some historical perspective from which to view our own times. Of the many WWII films that I have seen Mrs. Miniver is one of the best.".

Walter Pidgeon is also great in his role the second of his teamings with Garson. The great supporting cast includes Teresa Wright Dame May Whitty Richard Ney Reginald Owen and Henry Travers. Henry Travers' as Mr Ballard station master and a keen rose grower is in particular a memorable performer.Elements of the film have been well combined with drama romance light humour and finally tragedy.

	schema:headline " Its Propaganda Value is Greater than its Artistic Merit";
	schema:reviewBody "Winston Churchill famously said of this film that it had done more for the war effort than a flotilla of destroyers. Set in what Halliwell's Film Guide describes as the rosestrewn English village Hollywood variety it is a quite open and unashamed work of propaganda which deals with the fortunes of an uppermiddleclass English family during the early days of the Second World War. Clem the husband takes part in the Dunkirk evacuation his wife Kay helps to capture a German airman and their son Vin joins the RAF and fights in the Battle of Britain while conducting a romance with the attractive granddaughter of the Lady of the Manor.Churchill's view of Mrs Miniver was widely shared at the time as it won six Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director for William Wyler. Sixty years after the end of the war however it is hard to escape the conclusion that those awards were given for propaganda value than for artistic merit. I have not seen all the films that were in contention for the Best Picture award in 1943 but there are at least two in the list which I would rate much more highly Orson Welles's The Magnificent Ambersons and Michael Powell's FortyNinth Parallel another film which can be regarded as wartime propaganda but which deals with its subjectmatter in a more thoughtful and less sentimental way than Mrs Miniver. Perhaps Powell's implied criticism of American neutrality during the period 193941 did not go down well with the Academy.Much of the criticism of Mrs Miniver has concentrated on what is perceived to be an inaccurate Hollywoodized view of British life. There is some truth in these criticisms the characterisation of Vin for example as a middleclass radical who utters his leftwing opinions in a pompous voice seems to owe much to the American view of socialism as the opium of the bourgeois intellectual. It seems however unfair to put the blame on Hollywood for all the stereotypes contained in the film. The idea that English rural life typically consists of lovable workingclass rustics and formidable but decent aristocrats living in picturepostcard villages and obsessed by hobbies such as rosegrowing may be a caricature but it is the sort of caricature that could just as easily be found in British films of this period or for that matter in some of a later date. Some of the accents seem strange to modern British audiences Theresa Wright in particular seems stuck in midAtlantic but I doubt if American audiences of the forties were bothered. Walter Pigeon makes no attempt to disguise his Canadian accent but there is nothing in the script to say that Clem is actually an Englishman.The film has much in common with another wartime movie from two years later Since You Went Away which did for the American home front what Mrs Miniver had done for the British. Both films combine patriotism and sentimentality in equal doses and both feature a number of similar characters a young man eager to serve his country a pretty teenage girlfriend an impossibly younglooking mother Greer Garson here Claudette Colbert in the later film and even a crusty old grandparent who turns out to have a good heart beneath a forbidding exterior. It seems likely that Since You Went Away was influenced by the earlier film. Of the two I would rate Mrs Miniver slightly higher but it does share some of the defects excessive length and miscasting  that flawed the later film. Although it only lasts for two and a quarter hours as opposed to three it is slowmoving at times particularly during the first half. Greer Garson who was thirtyeight at the time and looked ten years younger was not convincing as the mother of the twentysix yearold Richard Ney who later became her husband. Her Best Actress award is particularly hard to understand. As with Since You went Away most of the best acting comes in the minor roles such as May Witty as the formidable dowager or Henry Wilcoxon as the patriotic Vicar.My own views of the film are best encapsulated by that quote from Halliwell's about false sentiment absurd rural types and melodramatic situations that was so derided by another reviewer. The sentiment seems so false precisely because it is deliberately manufactured for propaganda purposes. Wilcoxon's final speech is delivered in the sort of ringing tones that suggest he would have made an admirable substitute Prime Minister if Churchill had for any reason been unavailable but these are very much the sentiments of 1940. By 1942 the world had moved on a bit. It was an unfortunate irony that a film which so excoriates the German bombing of Britain should have been released in the first week of June 1942 a few days after Bomber Command's famous Thousand Bomber Raid on Cologne. There is a respectable historical case to be made that the bombing of German cities was a legitimate and necessary military tactic but it seems hypocritical of Allied propagandists to have attacked the enemy for using the same tactic themselves. Mrs Miniver may have been effective propaganda and propaganda in the service of a laudable cause but that ought not to prevent us from recognising it for what it is. 610".

Perhaps Powell's implied criticism of American neutrality during the period 193941 did not go down well with the Academy.Much of the criticism of Mrs Miniver has concentrated on what is perceived to be an inaccurate Hollywoodized view of British life. There is some truth in these criticisms the characterisation of Vin for example as a middleclass radical who utters his leftwing opinions in a pompous voice seems to owe much to the American view of socialism as the opium of the bourgeois intellectual. It seems however unfair to put the blame on Hollywood for all the stereotypes contained in the film. The idea that English rural life typically consists of lovable workingclass rustics and formidable but decent aristocrats living in picturepostcard villages and obsessed by hobbies such as rosegrowing may be a caricature but it is the sort of caricature that could just as easily be found in British films of this period or for that matter in some of a later date. Some of the accents seem strange to modern British audiences Theresa Wright in particular seems stuck in midAtlantic but I doubt if American audiences of the forties were bothered. Walter Pigeon makes no attempt to disguise his Canadian accent but there is nothing in the script to say that Clem is actually an Englishman.The film has much in common with another wartime movie from two years later Since You Went Away which did for the American home front what Mrs Miniver had done for the British. Both films combine patriotism and sentimentality in equal doses and both feature a number of similar characters a young man eager to serve his country a pretty teenage girlfriend an impossibly younglooking mother Greer Garson here Claudette Colbert in the later film and even a crusty old grandparent who turns out to have a good heart beneath a forbidding exterior. It seems likely that Since You Went Away was influenced by the earlier film. Of the two I would rate Mrs Miniver slightly higher but it does share some of the defects excessive length and miscasting  that flawed the later film. Although it only lasts for two and a quarter hours as opposed to three it is slowmoving at times particularly during the first half. Greer Garson who was thirtyeight at the time and looked ten years younger was not convincing as the mother of the twentysix yearold Richard Ney who later became her husband. Her Best Actress award is particularly hard to understand. As with Since You went Away most of the best acting comes in the minor roles such as May Witty as the formidable dowager or Henry Wilcoxon as the patriotic Vicar.My own views of the film are best encapsulated by that quote from Halliwell's about false sentiment absurd rural types and melodramatic situations that was so derided by another reviewer. The sentiment seems so false precisely because it is deliberately manufactured for propaganda purposes. Wilcoxon's final speech is delivered in the sort of ringing tones that suggest he would have made an admirable substitute Prime Minister if Churchill had for any reason been unavailable but these are very much the sentiments of 1940. By 1942 the world had moved on a bit. It was an unfortunate irony that a film which so excoriates the German bombing of Britain should have been released in the first week of June 1942 a few days after Bomber Command's famous Thousand Bomber Raid on Cologne. There is a respectable historical case to be made that the bombing of German cities was a legitimate and necessary military tactic but it seems hypocritical of Allied propagandists to have attacked the enemy for using the same tactic themselves. Mrs Miniver may have been effective propaganda and propaganda in the service of a laudable cause but that ought not to prevent us from recognising it for what it is. 610";

This portrait is no doubt stylized in some respects but it is believable in preserving the types of experiences that only those who lived through them could really understand.There are a few times when the pace lags too much and this tends to detract from the drama rather than adding to it.

The war came to the English people remember as Germany bombed the British Isle from the air. So the homefront was still a scary place to be.Greer Garson PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is stunningly beautiful as the middle class mother of three including improbably a collegeaged son. Mrs. Miniver must steer her family through the uncertainty of war. She keeps a positive outlook for her youngest children but worries for her loved ones out fighting for their country. She's a strong character and Garson's performance won her an Academy Award.Walter Pidgeon HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY FORBIDDEN PLANET plays Mr. Miniver Dame May Witty THE LADY VANISHES plays an aristocrat and Teresa Wright SHADOW OF A DOUBT THE PRIDE OF THE YANKEES plays her granddaughter. In addition to Garson's Oscar win Wright won for Best Supporting Actress and Pidgeon Witty and Henry Travers IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE were all nominated. The film won six Oscars including Best Picture.MRS. MINIVER is a powerful wartime drama but my favorite parts are the little human touches. A highlight is the youngest son Toby one of those kids who say the darndest things. The young actor seems very comfortable on camera and has quite a bit of charisma. Mr. and Mrs. Miniver have a sweet playful dynamic as a married couple. And there are little things throughout the movie that don't seem like much but add a human element. Toby fiddles with the handle of a church door as the family leaves mass. Mr. Miniver scoops up his son's hat as he climbs the stairs and flips it to him. A tipsy boatman pulls down a decorative banner as the crowd exits the bar. A maid kicks a door closed with her leg as she walks out of the dining room. Little things like this I noticed. I doubt these small actions were written into the script. They were probably devised onset by the director or the actors. William Wyler won a Best Director Oscar.Released in the midst of World War II MRS. MINIVER is an excellent film about the toll war takes on the innocent folks back home. It's a very human story with some strong characters. You'll get to know the Miniver family as if they were neighbors but you might shed a tear or two before the film is ended.William Wyler also directed the postwar Oscar powerhouse THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES also starring Teresa Wright an excellent film about American soldiers adjusting to civilian life after the war. It won seven Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director in 1947 and I highly recommend it for fans of MRS. MINIVER.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mrs. Miniver 1942The trajectory of this kind of filmhappy normal rich people right before World War II leading to hardship and tragedy during itis too familiar to play straight and at first Mrs. Miniver seems to play it straight. The first half might drag a modern viewer through boredom to an actual nap. The conflict in the nice happy lives of these upper crust Britons amounts to who will win a local rose competition. It's all sweet and well made but that's hardly enough. The acting is sustaining for sure. The two leads played by a wonderful Greer Garson the first Mrs. Miniver of three and her husband a likable Walter Pidgeon are completely convincing warm and eventually admirable. The supporting roles of the son played by Richard Ney and neighbor's daughter Teresa Wright a year after The Little Foxes and a year before Shadow of a Doubt are first rate if somewhat typecast. The scene is England and the year is 1939.Eventually the action turns and the hardships begin and death visits the family as it did so often in the south of England early in the war. That first hour of calm pays off now by contrast. And as a sidebar watch when mother and son kiss on the lips a little too warmly for mother and son. That's because Garson and Ney are hitting it off and they will soon marry for all of four years. Director William Wyler makes a highly professional job of all this. Certain moments will affect you if you let them like the bombing around the family in their little shelter. This is the fear of every sweet and ordinary family in war helpless and afraid but doing their best to survive with calm and even humor. The cheer of the townspeople between bombings and even as the warning of more planes is given makes you swell up with admiration. If there seems to be a lack of warmth of effusive love all around this is the typecast British style of course there is instead total goodness steadfastness and loyalty. There is the implication of love and of caring and doing what is right.And that above all is the point of the movie. War time movies Hollywood European or British equally had to support the cause. Sometimes it comes off metaphorically as an artistic parallel to the truth as in Casablanca which really is a kind of support the troops movie. And sometimes it is more literal showing soldiers in action or a population mobilized in every small way and this is Mrs. Miniver which has the lasting advantage of a human drama beyond mere fighting. Even the rose competition ends up as a lesson to the old guard to be willing to change with the times to embrace your countrymen across class barriers and do what is right.Taken out of context this is a commonplace drama made extremely well a great entertainment. Its predictability we don't know who will die but we know someone will and its stylized calm handling of really awful and terrifying scenes a wounded Nazi in your kitchen! make this something less than it might have been in other hands. Wyler is all about restraint but even he might have made a more gutwrenching version ten years later once the war is won. But of course that's not fair because when it was shot it wasn't known who was going to win. To appreciate the movie you have to see how a viewer with relatives on the battlefield would see it. Everyone is desperate to have their love affair while they can. People of all stripes had to wear an attitude of perseverance and survival. This movie ignores those who didn't play along the down side to war the civilian misdeeds. Yes this is a positive movie what the enemy would call propaganda. But in all out war anything less would have been suicidal.".

As German occupation looms their community seems so pure and diplomatic that the idea of the SS disruption is intensely real to us tragic. Winston Churchill himself claimed with complete confidence that this film did more to raise the morale of British troops than a fleet of destroyers.A big part of that surely comes from the movie's depiction of England's resourceful prevention of invasion as is illustrated in a quiet sequence wherein Pidgeon takes his motorboat to aid in the Dunkirk evacuations and of course England was the only European country that successfully averted occupation. The most powerful scene in the film a tour de force of direction is the when Mrs. Miniver is confronted by a wounded German pilot in her home quite a shock yet handled with humble calm.The heartbreaking element of this film is how joyous it is to see the joy of its characters in the peace of their community with a growing amount to lose.

	schema:headline " This Is A Sappy And Dull Film Hopelessly Out Of Date And Will Only Appeal To Americans Who Don't Know Their WWII History.";
	schema:reviewBody "Mrs. Miniver was one of Hollywood's major attempts to rally support for Britain in the early years of World War II. However at its onset MGM had a different approach to its political content than that which ultimately emerged in the film. Early in production Louis B. Mayer called director William Wyler into his office and told him to lighten up the character of the downed German flyer played by Helmut Dantine because the United States didn't hate anyone and Mayer had to answer to his stockholders. Selling American films abroad was and still is big business and Mayer didn't want to ruffle any box office feathers. I guess that's not surprising from a studio that paid a producer to scan the credits and change names that sounded too Jewish for films being released abroad. Wyler was allowed to make the German character suitably nasty only after Hitler declared war on the United States after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Ironically while Mrs. Miniver was very popular in the United States and won several Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actress it was ridiculed everywhere else especially in England the country it was supposed to glorify.Mrs. Miniver is the story of the Miniver family and their genteel life in merrie olde carefree England before Germany invades Poland and begins hostilities. The country life enjoyed by the Minivers architect Father shop'tilshedrops Mother spoiled Oxfordeducated son etc. is undermined until they all learn the meaning of sacrifice. One of the reasons the English scoffed at this film is its condescending attitude to the lower classes who were fighting the real war. We're supposed to feel sorry that poor Mr. Miniver nearly wrecks his sailboat trying to help his countrymen evacuate Dunkirk. Most of the actual Dunkirk defenders had no country house to go back to nor a family boat to take them.

	onyx:emotionText "Mrs. Miniver was one of Hollywood's major attempts to rally support for Britain in the early years of World War II. However at its onset MGM had a different approach to its political content than that which ultimately emerged in the film. Early in production Louis B. Mayer called director William Wyler into his office and told him to lighten up the character of the downed German flyer played by Helmut Dantine because the United States didn't hate anyone and Mayer had to answer to his stockholders. Selling American films abroad was and still is big business and Mayer didn't want to ruffle any box office feathers. I guess that's not surprising from a studio that paid a producer to scan the credits and change names that sounded too Jewish for films being released abroad. Wyler was allowed to make the German character suitably nasty only after Hitler declared war on the United States after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Ironically while Mrs. Miniver was very popular in the United States and won several Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actress it was ridiculed everywhere else especially in England the country it was supposed to glorify.Mrs. Miniver is the story of the Miniver family and their genteel life in merrie olde carefree England before Germany invades Poland and begins hostilities. The country life enjoyed by the Minivers architect Father shop'tilshedrops Mother spoiled Oxfordeducated son etc. is undermined until they all learn the meaning of sacrifice. One of the reasons the English scoffed at this film is its condescending attitude to the lower classes who were fighting the real war. We're supposed to feel sorry that poor Mr. Miniver nearly wrecks his sailboat trying to help his countrymen evacuate Dunkirk. Most of the actual Dunkirk defenders had no country house to go back to nor a family boat to take them.

	schema:reviewBody "In these supposed enlightened times director Michael Powell is considered a genius of British cinema. Emerging during the War as one of Britain's finest craftsmen Powell and his partner Emeric Pressburger created the undisputed classics The Life And Death Of Colonel Blimp 1943 Black Narcissus 1947 and The Red Shoes 1948.But despite critical and commercial success his career was in tatters by the early 1960's. The abrupt death of Powell's career can virtually be pinned down to one film his most uncompromising portrait of madness 1960's Peeping Tom.Powell's infamous shocker opens with a movie camerawielding Mark Lewis Carl Boehm following a prostitute to her boarding house room. Once inside he slides a spike from his tripod leg and films her action of terror before stabbing her to death. As the credits roll we find Mark alone in his apartment replaying the footage with wideeyed fascination.As the film progresses Mark is revealed as a stuttering loner whose sex drive has been somehow twisted into a murderous voyeuristic mania  working at a movie studio by day he moonlights as a glamour' photographer above a seedy newsagents. His blonde buxom model Pamela Green constantly taunting his virility is the embodiment of the female he despises. The inquisitive girl downstairs on the other hand becomes his ideal and his possible salvation. Ultimately she is doomed by her altruistic attraction when she insists Mark must show her one of his 'films'. Horrified she watches Mark as a child tortured by his father's camera experiment of recording a child's reaction to fear. Mark's own experiment of filming his murder victims leads him on a downward spiral of insanity to the film's tragic conclusion.Despite Peeping Tom's sensational subject matter Powell's intention was deadly serious to make a sober study of sexual violence as well as a meditation on the audience's role of voyeur. Powell's camera positions us directly behind Mark and his spectators so that we become his unwilling accomplices  the audience watches Mark watching his films. Carl Boehm as Mark gives a chilling performance at once icy reserve and murderous rage. Powell creates a garish red and pale blue twilight landscape of backstreet London in perfect detail. At the film's completion Powell believed he had made a masterpiece. Peeping Tom is certainly a personal film Powell and his coscriptwriter toiled for months until they had mastered a sympathetic threedimensional serial killer. In later years Powell would remain tightlipped about his real reasons for making the film. But Britain's premiere 'glamour' pinup queen Pamela Green  Peeping Tom's photomodel and penultimate victim  would offer clues to Powell's hidden agenda.Green became his leading choice for the role although she had not appeared outside 8mm stag films after seeing a lifesized nude portrait in her business partner Harrison Mark's studio. Her initial reception on the set was one of polite British reserve  until Powell unleashed his Jekyll and Hyde personality and she became one among many targets for his boorish intimidating manner. On the day of Green's death scene Powell changed his former plans of prudence and demanded she sprawl topless across her bed before she is skewered with Mark's tripod leg. She reluctantly gave in. Midshot she looked across the studio in horror. Beneath Powell's camera were his two preteen sons watching unwaveringly according to their father's instructions. This incident brought a chill over Powell's casting of his son as Mark junior and of himself as Mark's father.Whatever reasons drove Powell to make Peeping Tom he had effectively signed his career's death warrant. The film opened to scathing reviews in April 1960 just months after the similarlythemed Psycho. Ironically Hitchcock floated out of the controversy surrounding Psycho as the consummate old trickster and saved his slowly sinking career. The time seemed ripe for Peeping Tom among audiences and critics alike. Unfortunately for Powell the critics could find none of Psycho's black humour in his sober tome. 'Sick' and vile' were a small sample of their vitriol. The papers were outraged that a filmmaker of Powell's calibre could sink his talents into material so vulgar and perverse. Powell hoped the distributor would weather the storm and allow the audience to find the film on its own merits. Instead the plug was pulled on Peeping Tom after five days and at least in Britain the film was buried.The print was sold to the American Roadshow circuit with a lurid ad campaign designed to sell the film to a jaded American public. Shorn of twenty minutes footage the film was considered too 'British' and was shelved after a limited run. There it sat gathering dust for almost 20 years. Then in 1978 a cabal of admiring filmmakers led by Martin Scorsese himself no stranger to controversy rescued a complete print from Britain. Peeping Tom was thus relaunched in 1979 at the prestigious New York Film Festival to a predictably mixed reception. Correctminded commentators grudgingly accepted its 'masterpiece' tag but were nonplussed with the Film's treatment of its sexual violence.As for Powell the British film industry no longer considered him bankable after Peeping Tom. He made one more film in Britain before exiling himself to Australia. The antipodean They're A Weird Mob 1966 was on of his final films before his death in 1984. Luckily for Powell the film he considers his masterpiece is still revered and reviled but no longer ignored.".

	schema:reviewBody "To understand the stir that Peeping Tom caused when it was released in 1960 you need to think about what audiences at that time were accustomed to when they went to the cinema. Innocent love stories historical epics actionpacked westerns and colourful musicals were the staple cinematic diet of the time certainly not dark disturbing and intensely violent murder thrillers like this. What probably unsettled contemporary filmgoers even more was the fact that a film of this kind could come from a muchloved and revered director like Michael Powell. In modern times the equivalent would be if Steven Spielberg were to make a graphic and reviled film about paedophilia or bestiality consequently never being allowed to stand behind a movie camera again. When Peeping Tom hit the big screen it was rejected by the public and crucified by the critics and left Powell's hitherto glorious career in ruin.A film cameraman Mark Lewis Karl Boehm displays psychotic tendencies as he murders women with a spiked tripod attached to the bottom of his camera capturing on celluloid their final screams of agony. It is revealed that when he was a child Mark was used as a guinea pig by his father Michael Powell in a series of psychoanalytical experiments about the symptoms of fear. Among other things Mark's delightful dad would wake him throughout the night and shine lights in his eyes drop lizards into his bed and on one occasion even forced him to pose for photographs next to the dead body of his mother. As a result Mark has an unhealthy obsession with fear and in particular the expression that people have on their face during moments of fear.Peeping Tom is one of the few films that still has the power to shock all these years on. Psycho released roughly at the same time is still a great film but its shock value has been diminished by years of repeat viewings and increasing permissiveness in the cinema. But Peeping Tom is an altogether more disturbing piece of work. Boehm is excellent as the killer whose entire outlook has been skewed by his father's experiments. Also impressive is Anna Massey as the killer's fragile and unsuspecting fiance. Powell directs the film brilliantly using bold and dazzling colours to disguise the horrific atrocities that punctuate his film. It is understandable that the film was met with revulsion and rejection at that time but in retrospect it is a film of real importance and power. In a 21st century world bombarded and desensitised by harrowing images on the news and in the movies the theme of losing one's grasp on what is and isn't morally acceptable is more pertinent than ever. This is not easy viewing but it IS essential viewing.".

The phrase snuff films hadn't even been invented in 1960 nor did videotape cameras exist so the movie was far in advance of its time. You might be disappointed if you looking for pure excitement you have to be willing to examine deeper issues.Carl Bohm is perfect in the role of the killer and his faint German accent which might be interpreted as a. psychogenic speech defect adds to the creepiness of his character. Instead of an overthetop maniac Jack Nicholson are you listening? he portrays a frightened and insecure little person who can only relate to the world by looking at it preferably through a camera lens. It is easy to condemn him for his obsession with peeping but um aren't we doing the same thing by watching this movie or any movie? The most interesting movies are those that  provoke such questions in us. This aspect also helps explain why Peeping Tom was so fiercely condemned in 1960.The scenes between Bohm and Massey remind me of those between Gustav Diesel and Louise Brooks in the last part of Pandora's Box 1928 and you can bet the Michael Powell was familiar with Pabst's work.The idea that scrutiny  punishment was explored by Michel Foucault in his book Surveiller et Punir which I happened to read a long time ago. We will be finding out more about  this as the National Security State draws closer. Anyway here you have a powerless little guy who tries to feel the same sense of control by turning  his camera  literally  into a murderweapon. The technical details of this contrivance seem unrealistic but the symbolism is so powerful they scarcely matter.The hardedged sound of late50s cool jazz works very nicely in setting the atmosphere similar to Town Without Pity 1960. Nowadays we tend to think of that era as idyllic so its useful to remind ourselves of the dark edges that existed.".

This gave me a pang of sadness.  Peeping Tom' all but completely destroyed Powell's career and however much and for whatever reasons critics and audiences may have loathed the film this simply ought not have happened  especially since good or bad it's manifestly the work of a director at the height of his powers. The photography is wonderfully assured the colours are as bright and stark and controlled and fantastic as ever the script is clever and trusts to our intelligence and Powell still knows how to keep our minds glued to the screen even when our eyes tell us that nothing much is happening.  Every scene is unsettling.  Most are creepy.I could go on about the technical details  the use of sound and music is amazingly innovative too  but what really elevates Peeping Tom' what makes so many of the contemporary criticisms absurd is its compassion. There's none of that watereddown Freudian guff we encounter in Psycho'. Powell makes us feel for his serial killer  not so much by showing us that he feels pain but by showing us that he has ordinary likeable human qualities as well as madness.  A number of Powell's wartime said the same thing about Nazis.  It's clear that he really meant it.Not that this is an overt message of Peeping Tom' and not that there aren't a lot of other things going on as well.  I not only recommend I BEG that any admirer of Powell's earlier work give this one a try as well.

This preoccupation takes a disturbing twist in his need to kill and film women as he kills them.  So far so unsavoury.  Mark appears on the surface as a personable young man who just has this dangerous psychotic tendency he can't always keep in check.  The audience is thus invited to have some sympathy with him especially after the discovery that the young Mark was the focus for his father's experiments on the nature of fear in children show in part as the film within the film featuring Michael Powell and his son Columba and was filmed and recorded for the whole of his young life. No wonder the film is saying that he has grown into this disturbed person who has no real life away from either recording things on a camera or watching the results in his darkened room.Anna Massey has perhaps the prime female role in the film as Mark's downstairs neighbour Helen Stephens.  She is both repelled and attracted by Mark's moviemaking and perhaps she is closer to him that she would herself admit.  It is a restrained performance of considerable power.  Moira Shearer has a brief appearance as the studio standin who becomes his victim while Shirley Anne Field provides light relief as the film actress who can never get her lines right and doesn't know how to faint on camera.Peeping Tom' is a clever piece of work which perhaps came too soon to be acceptable to the establishment.  After all during Powell's collaborations with Emeric Pressburger they often pushed their luck with their subject matter and the way they presented it.  This film was the natural progression of that anarchistic spirit.

	schema:reviewBody "A shocking  unnerving and controversial film at the time  that caused real controversy  being no apt for the easily nauseated or sickened  in fact it was extremely panned by critics . It deals with a psychopath called Mark Lewis  Karlheinz Bhom  who lures women before his film camera  then he records their feared faces . Meanwhile  two police inspectors  Jack Watson and Ngel Davenport  are investigating the weird events .Disturbing subject matter about a psychopatic cameraman who uses his camera to record women's agonies  it is rendered breathtakingly by a great director  the British Michael Powell who performs briefly the part of Mark's abusive daddy  as he is shown on home movies harassing and tormenting the little boy  furthermore  including a brilliant cinematography by Otto Heller. This is a splendid  thrilling  and gripping as well as adult entertainment no recommended for nervous or squeamish . A classy of its kind but ultimately not for everyone . Powell is usually associated to great and colorful films  but here he made one of the most terrifying and frightening contributions to the cinema of the macabre since WWII.

	onyx:emotionText "A shocking  unnerving and controversial film at the time  that caused real controversy  being no apt for the easily nauseated or sickened  in fact it was extremely panned by critics . It deals with a psychopath called Mark Lewis  Karlheinz Bhom  who lures women before his film camera  then he records their feared faces . Meanwhile  two police inspectors  Jack Watson and Ngel Davenport  are investigating the weird events .Disturbing subject matter about a psychopatic cameraman who uses his camera to record women's agonies  it is rendered breathtakingly by a great director  the British Michael Powell who performs briefly the part of Mark's abusive daddy  as he is shown on home movies harassing and tormenting the little boy  furthermore  including a brilliant cinematography by Otto Heller. This is a splendid  thrilling  and gripping as well as adult entertainment no recommended for nervous or squeamish . A classy of its kind but ultimately not for everyone . Powell is usually associated to great and colorful films  but here he made one of the most terrifying and frightening contributions to the cinema of the macabre since WWII. The killings themselves are horrifyingly tense  causing panic and fear . Karl Bohm gives a nice acting as the ruthless psychopath young photographing his terrified victims at his hand  he couldn't be bettered as the horrible and cruel psycho.

	schema:headline " Not a masterpiece but very good";
	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed this movie a great deal but i don't think it's Powell's masterpiece.In fact it's probably the second weakest Powell film I've seen so far. Sometimes a controversial film will gain a reputation that it doesn't deserve and I think this is one of those cases. It's greatest flaw probably comes from a puritanical lack of violence. I know that's an odd thing to say about a movie with this kind of reputation but it's true. Peeping Tom is very violent for a movie released the early 60's but this shouldn't have been made in the early 60's. It was too soon for a movie like this. The subject matter needed a more explicit approach.Imagine Henry portrait of a serial killer only without any blood and every time a murder is about to happen the camera cuts away or fades out. That's what Peeping Tom is like. It's so well made that you don't really notice this right away and I'm sure it was very shocking to people when it was released... I didn't really begin to realize this was the problem until about half way through the movie but even before that i felt a certain detachment and the movie seemed to lack an emotional punch that should have been there.Hitchcock got around this in psycho with ingenious editing that made the audience believe they were seeing more than they were... Fritz lang does it frequently in movies made even before this through manipulative techniques that cause you to use you imagination to fill in the blanks... Powelll doesn't resort to those kinds of tricks. For one thing it's not really his style and also because peeping tom is a much different kind of film. While psycho is fundamentally a horror film and most of Fritz Langs more daring efforts are noirish crime thrillers peeping tom is really more of a morbid character study. A clinical examination of an insane mind. A movie about a killer where the audience views the film from his perspective. A movie like that needs to make the audience feel uncomfortable. You need moments in the film where you are sickened by what you see on screen but peeping tom handles the viewer with kid gloves. That's not really anyone's fault..Peeping Tom is simply a product of it's time and it's one of those cases where they could have made a much better movie about 12 years later. It's rare that i see a movie and my main complaint is that it's too old fashioned but that's what's wrong with Peeping Tom.There are great scenes though... Moments when you get an idea of what a great movie it could have been like the scene where the killer is showing his girlfriend home movies from his childhood. We see his father frightening him on purpose and sadistically filming it. It's a graphic demonstration of emotional violence that makes you wince. It's all expertly filmed and edited and it gives you a hint what Powell might have done a few years later.In the end I have to recommend Peeping Tom.. It's certainly worth viewing but make sure and lower your expectations if you've built it up as some kind of masterpiece.. It's not a masterpiece it's just excellent but that's OK.".

As little as he speaks his strong German accent is still apparent and mystifying in a character who has supposedly been born of British parents and spent the whole of his life in London. This wouldn't matter so much if Boehm were a better actor if he inhabited the role and made Mark Lewis a real person. Veteran Miles Malleson puts more oomph into his bit part as a dirty old man and he's only on the screen for about three minutes. The inclusion of Moira Shearer was surely just a favor between old friendsshe is too old too glamorous too starlike for her very small part. What was the significance of the disfigured woman earlier in the movie? It's a fascinating minute or so but the idea of how Mark sees imperfection is not picked up again.

Hitchcock filled his story with intentional humor so that it became not just a horror film but a black comedy as well with psychological overtones.

For one thing some of the incidents don't ring true at all. The girl who tries to befriend the antihero Anna Massey seems clueless to the fact that his stuttering creepiness might be masking a very troubled individual. Her casual attitude toward him becomes unconvincing after he continues to exhibit his odd behavior in various social situations. With credibility lost the picture is merely an exercise in watching someone selfdestruct because of his tormented past.The acting leaves something to be desired. Carl Boehm with his slight German accent tends to overact when more subtle restraint would have made his role more credible. A more attractive female costar would have helped someone like Hitch used in PSYCHOJanet Leigh but Anna Massey is a drab chinless looking little creature with her sad eyes and pursed lips. And the woman who might have made a more attractive costar Moira Shearer is given short shrift with an underwritten role and a brief appearance as a wannabe danceractress although she gets star billing.Still as a study of a troubled man PEEPING TOM does have its compensationsexcellent color photography and interesting use of a jazz music background.

	schema:headline " I'm ready for my closeup Mr. Perverted Killer...";
	schema:reviewBody "Absolutely positively BRILLIANT movie that singlehandedly caused a major earthquake in the until then overly politically correct British horror industry. Many critics and audiences weren't ready for this type of groundbreaking disturbance I doubt they even are nowadays which regretfully meant an unfair boycott of the film as well as of its genius director Michael Powell. The magnificence of Peeping Tom almost can't be described in words since it's so all embracing and frighteningly uptodate. Every single detail in the productionevery single line in the scriptevery single movement by the actors  actresses reaches damn close to perfection. It already starts with a controversial  but hugely courageous  basic premise Scoptophelia or the morbid desire to watch as explained by a psychiatrist in the film. Mark Lewis the main character can't live without registering everything he sees on camera. This hardly causes any problems in his daily life as he works in the filmindustry and gains some extra cash as the photographer of nudepictures. But the complexity of Mark's persona doesn't stop there. He constantly struggles with childhood traumas brought on by his scientistfather who always used Mark as a guinea pig for his own psychological research regarding the study of human fear. As a result of these inhuman tests Mark grew up a very timid and introvert man...but simultaneously with an insane and restless mind that can only be calmed down by committing gruesome murders...As you can read all over the Internet Peeping Tom is often mentioned in one sentence along with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho released the same year. Supposedly because together they dragged horrorcinema into the present tense by introducing villains that show no obvious physical characteristics like these of typical horror monsters and massmurderers. Indeed so Norman Bates as well as Mark Lewis are both ordinary and colorless men that turn out mankind's most bizarre perverts but that's pretty much where the comparison stops. Peeping Tom continues in intensity and controversy where Psycho eventually throws the towel in the ring. Other than Mark Lewis being a highly unlikely killer the script successfully covers psychological eeriness Mark's childhood is far more shocking than that of Norman Bates AND the alarming confrontation with the omnipresent theme of voyeurism. The uncontrollable desire of observing people is of all ages but an incredible taboo around the time this film got released. The prudishness and hypocrisy of society is masterfully illustrated near the beginning of the film when a seemly prominent citizen quietly requests pictures of sexily dressed women in a newspaper shop. If you see how embarrassed he is for buying sexy pictures you get an idea of how awry and difficult it must have been to shoot a film that actually puts the viewer in the position of a voyeur.Apart from being very intelligent very influential and very complex Peeping Tom of course also is VERY frightening! Not in the least because of Carl Boehm's creepy performance I can't believe the same guy played the fancy and wellbehaving Austrian Prince in my mother's favorite epic filmseries Sissi  Die Junge Kaiserin!!! but also because of the depressing atmosphere and the slow pacing. Not a single drop of blood is shed throughout the entire film and yet I rarely felt this uncomfortable upon seeing simple 'suggestions'. Watching Peeping Tom feels like unintentionally crashing into the set of a snuff film and the only thing you can do is to close your eyes. Butcan you? Or even worse do you want to?".

	onyx:emotionText "Absolutely positively BRILLIANT movie that singlehandedly caused a major earthquake in the until then overly politically correct British horror industry. Many critics and audiences weren't ready for this type of groundbreaking disturbance I doubt they even are nowadays which regretfully meant an unfair boycott of the film as well as of its genius director Michael Powell. The magnificence of Peeping Tom almost can't be described in words since it's so all embracing and frighteningly uptodate. Every single detail in the productionevery single line in the scriptevery single movement by the actors  actresses reaches damn close to perfection. It already starts with a controversial  but hugely courageous  basic premise Scoptophelia or the morbid desire to watch as explained by a psychiatrist in the film. Mark Lewis the main character can't live without registering everything he sees on camera. This hardly causes any problems in his daily life as he works in the filmindustry and gains some extra cash as the photographer of nudepictures. But the complexity of Mark's persona doesn't stop there. He constantly struggles with childhood traumas brought on by his scientistfather who always used Mark as a guinea pig for his own psychological research regarding the study of human fear. As a result of these inhuman tests Mark grew up a very timid and introvert man...but simultaneously with an insane and restless mind that can only be calmed down by committing gruesome murders...As you can read all over the Internet Peeping Tom is often mentioned in one sentence along with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho released the same year. Supposedly because together they dragged horrorcinema into the present tense by introducing villains that show no obvious physical characteristics like these of typical horror monsters and massmurderers. Indeed so Norman Bates as well as Mark Lewis are both ordinary and colorless men that turn out mankind's most bizarre perverts but that's pretty much where the comparison stops. Peeping Tom continues in intensity and controversy where Psycho eventually throws the towel in the ring.

I was really looking forward to seeing it but I have to say that I was a little disappointed. Compared to Black Narcissus and The Red Shoes  both amazing films  Peeping Tom seemed a big step down. I was left with the impression that the critics were probably right in that it was not a very good movie. Had it been better paced and better written it might have made a much better impression on critics at the time but as it is it just sort of came across as a rather dull and poorly done version of the sort of thing that British television specialized in at the time The Saint The Avengers Thriller etc. only more lurid. Carl Boehm was miscast and the scene with Moira Shearer seemed to go on for far too long and its only purpose seemed to be to show off her dancing. I would have preferred having her play a larger role. The detective element of the film was weak at best. The notion of Mark Lewis moonlighting as a porn photographer was interesting and I would have liked to have seen that explored a little more. It just seemed like the film was made up of a whole bunch of loose ends that were never tied up. The brightest spot was the casting of Anna Massey as Lewis' girlfriend. She brought an honesty to the role and her plain looks brought a certain beauty to the part that a more traditionally glamorous actress might have spoiled.Overall not a bad movie but not a great one either and Michael Powell didn't deserve to have his career ruined over it.".

Yet the absence of realism in the performances is striking  though probably no worse than most cinema of its time even in  Welles' great 'Touch of Evil' shot a year before only the director appears to really act.

It's just plain bad. Bad cinematography bad acting bad screenplay bad choice of material. Were this the film by which Powell is judged he would be compared to Ed Wood. I know Martin Scorsese likes this movie but for the life of me I can't figure out why.I understand that this film has been compared to Psycho. Can't figure that one out either.Peeping Tom does bear comparison to a Hitchcock film however Frenzy the only one of Hitch's films whose trailer is better than the movie and the only one in which Hitch resorted to cheap effects including the choice of a bad musical score gratuitous nudity and that ludicrous shot of Barbara LeighHunt's corpse. Powell doesn't quite go that far simply showing the protagonist Mark Lewis played by Carl Boehm unsheathing his hidden tripod spike to stab his victims in the throat. Powell used a stag film star as one of the victims which I guess was kind of louche and therefore attractive to some.The overall cheapness of the project despite the use of Anna Massey and Moira Shearer contributes to the overall tawdriness of Peeping Tom. While I certainly number some low budget masterpieces among my favorites it's obvious that Powell took some awful short cuts in making this one and never asked his actors to provide anything like acting.The plot of Peeping Tom is outlined elsewhere on this web page and I don't feel it necessary to duplicate the efforts of others. I would like to see some of the later Powell efforts especially Age of Consent and the two Pressburger collaborations in Australia from the 1970's but I think none of these probably rises to the heights Powell and Pressburger reached in the 40's and 50's. There's some great Powell out there however undiscriminating praise of his art does him no favor. If Criterion is going to bother to release Peeping Tom I think it might behoove them to release some of Anthony Asquith's previously unreleased At lease in America films like The Way to the Stars.".

Personally speaking I didn't buy the story for one second. It looked more like a cleverly constructed homage of the director's career than a real horror film. The film is mostly a pity fest tortured misunderstood artist who's totally possessed by his need to express himself through in this case a most deadly artform of capturing death on film by killing the women and only women he meets. As usual in these kind of tortured artist stories there's a woman who falls for Mark and the thing sorta becomes a tragic love story thank god Alfred Hitchcock didn't write a love interest for Norman Bates in PSYCHO. The idea of Helen wonderfully played by underrated Anna Masey falling for Mark is ridiculous and totally forced. The clunky premise isn't helped much by the unconvincing psychology behind the killer's motivations his father tortured him when he was a kid and yet Mark as an adult only kills women. Okay. Things only got less subtle with Helen's mother being a blind woman who's all seeing and wise which SCREAMED to me that the film was more of a notsosubtle symbolic exercise from Michael Powell about himself and his career as a filmmaker than anything else. The fact that Michael Powell himself played the domineering father in the black and white home movies and that the kid who plays young Mark was Michael Powell's real son and the fact the home movies were shot where Powell grew up as a kid only reinforced the whole selfindulgent aspect of the movie me me me! This obvious selfindulgence in the story and direction killed ALL attempts at horror.But if you watch PEEPING TOM as a tribute to Michael Powell's career made by Michael Powell himself well the movie is suddenly fitting and brilliant. Fitting as a tribute because PEEPING TOM  suddenly became Powell's last major movie after the uproar it created when it was released. PEEPING TOM or the controversy surrounding the movie basically killed Powell's career as a serious filmmaker. The elaborate behindthescenes moments or the scenes with Moira Shearer who worked with Powell in THE RED SHOES dancing around the studios say more about the famed filmmaker than the film's tortured character. Watch PEEPING TOM as some sort of elaborate postmodern tribute to the director. Don't watch it as a horror movie.

Thank god people don't speak like that anymore. It's not the poor girl's fault though  anyone who puts this rubbish in the same brackets with Psycho must be as blind as her whiskey gulping mother downstairs. With his bawdy lips and perfectly parted hair Boehm looks more like someone loitering in public toilets than a serial killer with a soul whom we're supposed to feel for this apparently being the spin regarding the serial killer issue cause you see Boehm's character suffered childhood abuse by his scientist father who was obviously a nutter. So it's not Boehm's fault either. At one point when his character seems fascinated by one of the girls' disfigured face you almost think in disbelief that the film is about to go down the path of The Spiral Staircase  another lukewarm horrorthriller which at least has some redeeming qualities. Well mercifully it doesn't go that way but that's hardly a plus  this is as horrific as a meowing cat and as thrilling as a wind in the toilet bowl. The piano solo score sounds like it was composed by the least talented student in Ravel's class the one taken on board out of sheer pity. I haven't seen any of Michael Powell's preceding apparently acclaimed films  nor have I any desire to do so after viewing this spineless lemonade. No small wonder everyone hated it  not because it's a misunderstood masterpiece ahead of its time but because it's utterly and terminally bad equally as bad today as it was in 1960.

Thank god people don't speak like that anymore. It's not the poor girl's fault though  anyone who puts this rubbish in the same brackets with Psycho must be as blind as her whiskey gulping mother downstairs. With his bawdy lips and perfectly parted hair Boehm looks more like someone loitering in public toilets than a serial killer with a soul whom we're supposed to feel for this apparently being the spin regarding the serial killer issue cause you see Boehm's character suffered childhood abuse by his scientist father who was obviously a nutter. So it's not Boehm's fault either. At one point when his character seems fascinated by one of the girls' disfigured face you almost think in disbelief that the film is about to go down the path of The Spiral Staircase  another lukewarm horrorthriller which at least has some redeeming qualities. Well mercifully it doesn't go that way but that's hardly a plus  this is as horrific as a meowing cat and as thrilling as a wind in the toilet bowl. The piano solo score sounds like it was composed by the least talented student in Ravel's class the one taken on board out of sheer pity. I haven't seen any of Michael Powell's preceding apparently acclaimed films  nor have I any desire to do so after viewing this spineless lemonade. No small wonder everyone hated it  not because it's a misunderstood masterpiece ahead of its time but because it's utterly and terminally bad equally as bad today as it was in 1960. True the first two or three minutes of the film seem vaguely promising  but then every film is good at the beginning it's how it carries on that counts.

	schema:reviewBody "Though I don't know anything about French social contexts during the 1960's and 1970's though I haven't read any of Duras' works though I can't figure out what is the message behind this movie I still feel Nathalie Granger is one of the most beautiful films ever made. The beauty of Nathalie Granger doesn't come from its visual quality nor the objects it depicts but from its serenity and the way things are represented. I have to quote the phrase makes my heart cave in from American Beauty to describe my feeling for this movie because that's what I really feel and the feeling I get from Nathalie Granger is in a way similar to the feeling I get from the dancing plastic bag scene in American Beautythough Nathalie Granger is not didactic at all. As for me who don't understand any symbols hidden in Nathalie Granger the great sense of enjoyment I get from this movie comes from its sublimation of simple things and of domestic chores. Duras makes me look at simple things again in such amazement such wonder such astonishment of how beautiful they actually are.For me the table cleaning scene is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. Though I might have seen people clearing tables a thousand times in my life I still feel I have never seen anything like this scene before. Duras can capture the beauty and the charm of simple things into her film and by representing them like something we have never seen before she also captures the hearts of the audience. Another thing that impresses me a lot is the performance of Lucia Bose especially in the scene with Gerard Depardieu. I like the expression on her face very much when she listens to the salesman. The radio broadcast about murderers at large is another thing that I like. There are also many other extraordinarily beautiful and calm scenes in this movie the tearing up of paper the piano playing the characters' walking the things that they do with leaves and the shots of a baby carriage. I describe only my feelings here not the meaning of this movie because a few books have already deciphered it. Though I'm aware that the feeling I get might not be what Duras intended I still feel very grateful for her for opening my eyes to see a wonderful kind of beauty and for giving me a rare and precious sense of nonconforming serenity.".

	schema:headline " Alas poor Nathalie";
	schema:reviewBody "I just saw Nathalie Granger for the first time this morning and must say that I am now both highly impressed and deeply moved by the experience. Impressed with the professional execution of what must be a difficult script to shoot. Moved by the strange combination of quiet serenity and uneasy claustrophobia produced by the interacting of the silent femmes and the Gothic looking house garden and pond. That this was the very house Duras lived in may also contribute to the experience.The professionalism is perhaps not so surprising. The beautiful black and white cinematography is by Ghislain Cloquet. He worked with Alain Resnais in the fifties but for me his most important work is for Robert Bresson Au hazard Balthasar Mouchette and Une femme douce three of the most captivating movies I have ever seen. As for the actors both Bose and Moreau have worked with Antonioni and the latter of course also with Truffaut and Bunuel. The meeting of these people with the dense script of one the major writers of the time should call for the utmost attention on the side of the viewer every scene invites close inspection as well as an open mind to what we are seeing just as much as what we are not seeing a presence or an absence. We may not see much on the screen but contrary to other reports on this site I would not call Nathalie Granger a minimalist work. I find it to be as full of mystery as any tale of horror you might name even if the means involved may be sparse. Indeed perhaps due to dark Isabelle lurking about draped in her long black cape by the gloomy pond in the overgrown garden the film has as much a vampirish look as Dreyer's Vampyr or Jean Rollin's Le viol de Vampire. And this look is completely justified by the ongoing killings in the vicinity as well as the statement uttered that Isabelle's problematic daughter Nathalie would like to kill someone. The conflict between these horrors and the quiet mood surrounding the characters creates a tension in a most skillful way the effect on a receptive mind can be shattering.The professionalism therefore might be taken for granted but many professionally made movies do not move me. This does and almost as much as the Bresson films mentioned above. But where Bresson as well as Dreyer work within a spiritual context that might more easily produce transcendence Duras more in tradition of Antonioni perhaps works without spirituality at least without the presence of spirituality. Yet I might call the effect the film has on me as transcendent. Why? It may be precisely the very absence that contributes to the paradox that this art of the void can work its mysterious wonders. Even the few uncertain notes of Nathalie's piano practice that constantly accompanies the silence of the rooms seem to contribute to the experience. She may be giving up music but it seems that her life is breathing in these few notes. If the music stops then what will happen? So although the cinematography and the settings might create their own poetry I think it is the story of Nathalie that moves me. We know from the school reports that Nathalie is in trouble we also know that it is her film at least it is named after her. Yet we do not see much of her. But we do hear her her playing is setting the mood. And in the empty rooms we may also look for her even it is clear that she is not there. But we see her things This belongs to Nathalie do not touch a note says. Her absence is present. So what? So she may be in the garden chasing the black cat but even that without much luck. When she tries to put the cat in the baby carriage it runs away. She kicks the carriage violently over. Are we to assume some sort of correspondence between the unseen killers and the poor Nathalie? In a different script she would run away and become their victim of course but in this film we are left to wonder about her destiny. There are many such uncertainties and they all do their tiny bit of work on the bewildered spectators of which at least I might say that I will certainly watch this film again and that with still greater expectations. I do not usually become so moved by works of cinema so any viewing that make me write a review within an instant I will take good care of. Well Nathalie Granger up on the top of my shelf you go beside the other greats. Just one hesitation though The interlude of the intruding washing machine salesman hilariously played by the then fresh Depardieu although indeed very funny in itself might be a problem Precisely because it seems to stand alone. With the women we might just gaze at him in wonder and agree as they say that you are not a salesman. But I could add we might also say You do not belong here that is in this film. But the women however seem amused. He could be from another planet as far as they are concerned. There are just two scenes with Depardieu but they tend to dominate far too much as the very presence of this big and clumsy man which we also now may have seen too much of in later movies is all it takes to relieve our mind of young and tender Nathalie at least while he is on the screen. He is a spectacle in himself. The women are diverted for a while. So are we. But is this comic interlude necessary? At the moment I am not sure at least I cannot see why.".

Though the director is also credited as the writer there is decidedly more writing in the liner notes on the DVD. 'Dull domestic ritual?' If that includes repeatedly walking trancelike in and out of rooms though sometimes it's just the room sans a life form for no particular reason staring off into the distance for interminable periods of time a lack of what humans have come to know and embrace as conversation so much so that it could be described as monasterial the comatose deportment of all but 1 of the 7 characters a cavernous void where a story might reside well then I'd say that the description hits the nail on the head  which I suppose would account for the undercurrent of violence. Overall the film lacks the sort of cohesion that would bind you to the experience and comes across as a series of scenes without narrative or resolution of any kind.

	schema:headline " A film heavy with empty space";
	schema:reviewBody "Being no expert in French minimalist films I stumbled across this film as it bears my name. Being a minimalist myself I was compelled to watch it even though the reviews are variable. Much could be written about what Dumas was trying to convey in this film but watching it is like standing in front of Yves Kleins 1962 'Monochrome Painting' make of it what you will. Two women sisters? go about their day in their middleclass French house of the early 1970's. While the movie narrates the seemingly mundane there is an undercurrent of mystery and perhaps malice surrounding the child Nathalie whom the movie is named after. We barely see Nathalie but the viewer is drawn into joining her disturbed mother Isabelle in waiting for her while staring vacantly or walking the garden in her black cape. The two women prepare Nathalie's clothes and suitcase for her impending trip away to boarding school. The silence is occasionally broken by updates on the radio about the police hunt for a pair of serial killer teenagers who are hiding in the nearby forest. While nothing of note appears to happen the air is heavy with expectancy drawing the viewer in. What's wrong with Nathalie? Why do they have to send her away? What terrible violent behavior does this seemingly innocent child display that would cause her to be expelled from school. The Other WomanIsabelle's sister? mentions Nathalie told her she would like to kill people and become an orphan. Gerard Depardieu plays in what appears to be his first movie the role of The Salesman who punctuates the emptiness with his bumbling doortodoor sales visit to sell a washing machine. Personally I found this scene masterful. The women shred his confidence through their impenetrability and the statement You are no salesman. Their cruel coldness cuts so deeply that he returns later having questioned his entire life and career choices. He really is a bad salesman. Some may have missed the black humor in the ending of this scene where they finally let him know they already owned the model of washing machine he was so ineptly trying to sell them. They were only playing with him like the black cat that stalks their house may play with an injured mouse. Others have commented about how this scene was unnecessary and misplaced but I believe it is the clue to what is wrong with Nathalie. The women are cold hard and unemotional particularly Nathalie's mother Isabelle. We see they are capable of emotional cruelty. Has Nathalie been damaged by her mother and aunt ? and is acting out with violence in a desperate attempt to for love and attention? The scene where Nathalie catches cats to push in a pram is telling. The cats will not oblige and run off into the forest. Nathalie yearns for love but what she tries to love runs from her. In anger she pushes the pram into a ditch. The abandoned pram appears in other sequences perhaps as a symbol of rejection. I am grateful for having found this obscure movie. It leaves a mark on you and it's openness to interpretation and symbolism leaves you thinking even after the credits roll.".

	onyx:emotionText "Being no expert in French minimalist films I stumbled across this film as it bears my name. Being a minimalist myself I was compelled to watch it even though the reviews are variable. Much could be written about what Dumas was trying to convey in this film but watching it is like standing in front of Yves Kleins 1962 'Monochrome Painting' make of it what you will. Two women sisters? go about their day in their middleclass French house of the early 1970's. While the movie narrates the seemingly mundane there is an undercurrent of mystery and perhaps malice surrounding the child Nathalie whom the movie is named after. We barely see Nathalie but the viewer is drawn into joining her disturbed mother Isabelle in waiting for her while staring vacantly or walking the garden in her black cape. The two women prepare Nathalie's clothes and suitcase for her impending trip away to boarding school. The silence is occasionally broken by updates on the radio about the police hunt for a pair of serial killer teenagers who are hiding in the nearby forest. While nothing of note appears to happen the air is heavy with expectancy drawing the viewer in. What's wrong with Nathalie? Why do they have to send her away? What terrible violent behavior does this seemingly innocent child display that would cause her to be expelled from school. The Other WomanIsabelle's sister? mentions Nathalie told her she would like to kill people and become an orphan.

	schema:headline " A Smart Visually Stunning Creative Comedy of Sexual Variations";
	schema:reviewBody "Writerdirector Tom Twyker Run Lola Run Perfume Heaven The International. Paris je t'aime is proving to be one of the most fearless and creative talents in film today. He knows how to create strange stories that take us by surprise present them with excellent actors selects and composes musical scores that are as perfect as any being created introduces just enough philosophy and scientific investigation into timely topics to challenge our brains and tops it off with inventive photography  superimposing split screens that enhance not only the progress of the story but also allow the presentation of brief glimpses of 'dangerous' ideas that stirs the cauldron to boiling.3 is a fascinating tale. Simon Sebastian Schipper is an artistic architect who works with sculptors to bring their art into being. He is in a longterm relationship with Hanna Sophie Rois who is a television journalist cum scientist who is widely popular in their hometown of Berlin. Simon and Hanna are in their forties and deeply in love. Simon is informed that his mother has advanced pancreatic carcinoma and when his mother attempts suicide with an overdose and fails she is brain dead supported on machines. Simon stays at her bedside while Hanna continues her line of investigation about new stem cell theories attending lectures by the handsome Adam Devid Striesow  a married man with children who leads a separate life of clandestine but shortlived gay affairs. Simon's mother dies and Simon is diagnosed with testicular carcinoma undergoes an orchiectomy and begins chemotherapy losing his hair in the process. All of this he shares with Hanna the two decide they probably should marry and Hanna wants children while Simon thinks world timing is poor for starting a family he is also aware of the fact that his operation and chemotherapy may represent the end of his sexuality and fertility.Though devoted to Simon Hanna is attracted to Adam and finds ways to be near him. Soon they are in a physical love affair. Simon recovers his disease by swimming in a beautiful Berlin gym where he quite incidentally meets Adam shares his operation with the stranger in the locker room and Adam proceeds to demonstrate that Simon is indeed not impotent! Simon has new feelings aroused and he and Adam begin a love affair. Hanna and Simon get married but still each of them has feelings for Adam.

	onyx:emotionText "Writerdirector Tom Twyker Run Lola Run Perfume Heaven The International. Paris je t'aime is proving to be one of the most fearless and creative talents in film today. He knows how to create strange stories that take us by surprise present them with excellent actors selects and composes musical scores that are as perfect as any being created introduces just enough philosophy and scientific investigation into timely topics to challenge our brains and tops it off with inventive photography  superimposing split screens that enhance not only the progress of the story but also allow the presentation of brief glimpses of 'dangerous' ideas that stirs the cauldron to boiling.3 is a fascinating tale. Simon Sebastian Schipper is an artistic architect who works with sculptors to bring their art into being. He is in a longterm relationship with Hanna Sophie Rois who is a television journalist cum scientist who is widely popular in their hometown of Berlin. Simon and Hanna are in their forties and deeply in love. Simon is informed that his mother has advanced pancreatic carcinoma and when his mother attempts suicide with an overdose and fails she is brain dead supported on machines. Simon stays at her bedside while Hanna continues her line of investigation about new stem cell theories attending lectures by the handsome Adam Devid Striesow  a married man with children who leads a separate life of clandestine but shortlived gay affairs. Simon's mother dies and Simon is diagnosed with testicular carcinoma undergoes an orchiectomy and begins chemotherapy losing his hair in the process. All of this he shares with Hanna the two decide they probably should marry and Hanna wants children while Simon thinks world timing is poor for starting a family he is also aware of the fact that his operation and chemotherapy may represent the end of his sexuality and fertility.Though devoted to Simon Hanna is attracted to Adam and finds ways to be near him. Soon they are in a physical love affair. Simon recovers his disease by swimming in a beautiful Berlin gym where he quite incidentally meets Adam shares his operation with the stranger in the locker room and Adam proceeds to demonstrate that Simon is indeed not impotent! Simon has new feelings aroused and he and Adam begin a love affair. Hanna and Simon get married but still each of them has feelings for Adam. When Hanna discovers she is pregnant the story spins to its conclusion and the triptych of the title is established.This film is subtle but frank explores sexuality in an open and honest way exploring themes relevant to our time the biological and the ethical side of human life the determinist way of viewing our sexuality and gender the ways in which we define our selves in a time with shifting mores the chance of love in a society with few if any boundaries.

Other movies from his filmography have a very distinct Seventies art house film feel to them  Deadly Maria Winter Sleepers Heaven and 3. They are painfully slow full of empty self importance cover subjects middle aged teachers tend to consider important in life. Except for the name Tom Tykwer they don't have too much in common with Lola. Don't let the name fool you.Sophie Rois Hanna is certainly a strange choice for the leading role in a Folie a Trois. She doesn't look too nice is much older than her two male love interests has a terrible voice and  as Hanna  a personality that would probably drive most men away from her. Hanna is in a long time relationship with Simon Sebastian Schipper that obviously went stale quite some time ago. By pure chance she's meets the handsome Adam Devid Striesow and has sex with him the first time the same day Simon is told he's got testicular cancer and subjected to surgery on the spot. Losing a testicle must have turned him into half a man because shortly afterwards he has a chance encounter with the handsome Adam that turns into his first homosexual experience. Good for him that while homosexuality is genetic and has nothing to do with free will heterosexuality isn't right? Will the two pairs end up as Three? That's actually the big question the whole story of this movie. Tykwer uses a lot of decoration to make it look more important. Hanna is the presenter of a TV Art Show Simon works in the art business Adam in the stemcell research. Simons mother gets cancer and ends up as a yummy piece of art. Lots of opportunities to touch important issues and show interesting scenes. But even though Tykwer used a budget that in the Seventies would have been enough to make quite a few independent films he manages to present it all in an extremely dull way. You actually feel sorry for all this people with their very fashionable jobs and their shallow existences. Compared to this the Menage a Trois really shines. 3 is part of the pseudointellectual art world it so knowingly depicts.When Simon wears his woolly hat and thick glasses he resembles quite a lot the everyday appearance of Dani Lewy coowner and cofounder of Tykwer's production company with his angular shaped face Adam looks quite a bit like timid Tykwer himself. Just saying. Just looking for a reason.I don't know if I missed any kind of explanation for the very strange effects the castration in this movie has. I could easily dismiss it as an embarrassing goof or an inane plot device. But when the end is near even some plants show a surprisingly combative spirit and don't just wither away. The basis topic of Three is the midlife crisis the period in life when people suddenly want much more of things they once had or something completely new. Someone in this troublesome age might find this movie quite interesting and the ending inspiring uplifting depressing or allegorically profound.".

Simon is out one night at the local covered pool where he has an intimate very intimate encounter with... Wait for it... Adam! Simon is confused a bit startled and probably mostly curious. The three of them begin these affairs cultivating new ideas about their sexual selves. Hanna and Simon also rediscover their sexual selves together. And that's just the first half of the film.

The use of the number 3 as part of the narrative falls a bit flat. Given the apparent love triangle 3 would seem sufficient to reference just that. Where Tykwer works real magic is in his ability to make his actors go allin. There is no trepidation or fear of laying it all bare before the camera. If you are a fan of the work of Whit Stillman Wes Anderson or Noah Baumbach you'll like 3. It's quite good.".

On the one hand it is obvious that the director is a rather savvy filmmaker while on the other the movie reels off uncontrolled after the first half of the picture to the point of becoming at least in my mind totally ridiculous. I suppose it is probably 'too modern' for me I don't know.Don't get me wrong I am far from being a puritan of any sort much less homophobic but I think this was not only completely over the top especially the ending but also completely unrealistic not to say impossible. The 'teaching' of the movie is in my opinion also completely wrong. One cannot and should not always do as one pleases otherwise our world as we know it would probably implode.

On the one hand it is obvious that the director is a rather savvy filmmaker while on the other the movie reels off uncontrolled after the first half of the picture to the point of becoming at least in my mind totally ridiculous. I suppose it is probably 'too modern' for me I don't know.Don't get me wrong I am far from being a puritan of any sort much less homophobic but I think this was not only completely over the top especially the ending but also completely unrealistic not to say impossible. The 'teaching' of the movie is in my opinion also completely wrong. One cannot and should not always do as one pleases otherwise our world as we know it would probably implode. As I said before too modern...";

	schema:reviewBody "3 is a 2hour 5yearold movie written and directed by Tom Tykwer one of the most famous German filmmakers right now. He usually makes Englishlanguage films these days but this one here is a bit of a return back to the roots for him. Not a surprise that this film got lots of awards recognition all over the world. Tykwer won best Director at the German Film Awards Rois won Best Actress and Mathilde Bonnefoy won Best Editing. Bonnefoy recently won an Oscar for her documentary on Edward Snowden but she has been a longtimeeditor for Tykwer before her biggest success.Let's start with the positive things about this movie The 3 actors all did a fine job and it is an interesting story Tykwer tells us here. Some of his films struggle in terms of credible character development but here he certainly delivers in that area. It is a dramatic movie but it's never depressing. Even a cancer diagnosis cannot destroy the relationships in this film. I would almost call it a feelgood film. Also I think Tykwer succeeded in giving us a very aesthetic take on bisexuality which is a huge challenger and I have seen many films in which the director totally failed with this attempt. This is much more than a gaythemed movie. It's a triangle love story with great feelings. And finally Major Tom is a truly great song even if it is a bit narcissistic given Tykwer's first name. But unfortunately there are negative aspects too. The major one for me is credibility. First of all Striesow's character coincidentally is always where Rois's is early on. At the convention. At the theater. At the football game. It's really not that realistic. And then he also falls in love with Schipper's director of the famous recent film Victoria character after pretty much no indicators that both men are bisexual? And what is it with the likelihood of the two meeting in a swimming pool after Striesow's character already has an affair with Rois'. This is a bit of a problem here in my opinion. I appreciate the way love is depicted but they should have found a better route to it. And finally a minor criticism about the film's poster which is a major spoiler as it is actually the last shot of the film. Certainly a beautiful shot and a nice way to close it but why give it away already? I also did not like the split screen shots on several occasions but that's just subjective.Anway all in all I enjoyed the watch. i also believe this is a good film to watch more than once as I certainly liked it more the second viewing. Looking at this one I would love Tykwer to make more films here in Germany again as he certainly has a good deal of talent and there are more than enough actors he could use to come up with interesting projects in the future. As for 3 I recommend the watch. Totally worth checking out.".

	schema:reviewBody "William Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST is probably his last play written in 161011 and as such it has some of the more eloquent passages of soliloquies of any of his works. In the original version the story is set on a remote island 'where Prospero the exiled Duke of Milan plots to restore his daughter Miranda to her rightful place using illusion and skillful manipulation. The eponymous tempest brings to the island Prospero's usurping brother Antonio and the complicit Alonso King of Naples. There his machinations bring about the revelation of Antonio's low nature the redemption of Alonso and the marriage of Miranda to Alonso's son Ferdinand.' Enter Julie Taymor and the imaginative play becomes even more so with her deft rewriting and direction and use of visual effects. In Taymor's versions 'the main character is now a woman named Prospera. Going back to the 16th or 17th century women practicing the magical arts of alchemy were often convicted of witchcraft. In Taymor's version Prospera is usurped by her brother and sent off with her fouryear daughter on a ship. She ends up on an island it's a tabula rasa no society so the mother figure becomes a father figure to Miranda. This leads to the power struggle and balance between Caliban and Prospera a struggle not about brawn but about intellect.' Taymor and Shakespeare together make the important character of Ariel Prospera's obedient sprite a thing of magic Ben Wishaw darts and floats and flies about apparently in the buff in a most ingenious fashion delivering his lines in perfect Shakespearean cadence his 'Full fathom five thy father lies... ' is exquisite. The transformation of Prospero to Prospera is magical with Helen Mirren once again proving that she is an incomparably fine actress one great moment is her delivery of the lines 'Our revels now are ended. These our actors As I foretold you were all spirits and are melted into air into thin air And like the baseless fabric of this vision The cloudcapp'd towers the gorgeous palaces The solemn temples the great globe itself Ye all which it inherit shall dissolve And like this insubstantial pageant faded Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff As dreams are made on and our little life Is rounded with a sleep.' THE TEMPEST is an odd assortment of magic treachery young love silly comedy and odd goings on but filled with a cast such as Taymor has selected it jumps alive with passion and glee. Caliban is Djimon Hounsou Miranda is Felicity Jones The King of Naples is David Strathairn and his son Ferdinand is young Reeve Carney Prospera's brother Antonio is Chris Cooper and his sidekick Sebastian is Alan Cumming and the two actors assigned to the buffoon roles are Albert Molina and Russell brand. Gonzalo is Tim Conti. This tightened Tempest works well though one wonders how much of the opening scenes' shipwreck due to Prospera's calling upon the tempest adds to the overall story. Yet in Taymor's vision it all comes together beautifully. The sung portions of the play and the musical sore in general are from the intelligent pen of Elliot Goldenthal. Recommended! Grady Harp".

	onyx:emotionText "William Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST is probably his last play written in 161011 and as such it has some of the more eloquent passages of soliloquies of any of his works. In the original version the story is set on a remote island 'where Prospero the exiled Duke of Milan plots to restore his daughter Miranda to her rightful place using illusion and skillful manipulation. The eponymous tempest brings to the island Prospero's usurping brother Antonio and the complicit Alonso King of Naples. There his machinations bring about the revelation of Antonio's low nature the redemption of Alonso and the marriage of Miranda to Alonso's son Ferdinand.' Enter Julie Taymor and the imaginative play becomes even more so with her deft rewriting and direction and use of visual effects. In Taymor's versions 'the main character is now a woman named Prospera. Going back to the 16th or 17th century women practicing the magical arts of alchemy were often convicted of witchcraft. In Taymor's version Prospera is usurped by her brother and sent off with her fouryear daughter on a ship.

I loved the scene when Miranda first meets Ferdinand  Mirren's ironic commentary added a whole new dimension to the play for me.I also loved Tony Conti as the aged senator Gonzalo.

	schema:reviewBody "The Tempest shows a filmmaker just itching to let loose her turbulent bigsplashofacanvas vision of Shakespeare onto the screen and the itch for better or worse is scratched sufficiently. This is a work that takes the delightfully and eerily dark take on the Bard that Taymor had before with Titus and suffuses it with the computergenerated surreal landscape of Across the Universe. Whether you can really dig into Taymor's films or not to varying degrees for some at the least it's hard to ignore her artistic prowess of pushing the envelope of what might be acceptable or just what is normal and stretching the boundaries until you wonder what boundaries are even for in the first place  that is you wonder so that people like Taymor or Terry Gilliam can break them f them about and give audiences something different with the acting and the mood of the piece while oddly enough staying true to at least the original spirit of the source material Beatles Frida Kahlo the Bard.This time her Tempest is almost nearing all over the place visually but luckily it's anchored on one of Shakespeare's most underrated works  it's one of my personal favorites from him actually a work drenched in fantasy and ideas of late 16th century God's law and man in the high and low areas of class meaning those who have it i.e. explorers and those that don't Djimon Hunsou's native character. The big change to anyone who has read the play is that Prospero is now Prospera played with big emotions and big movements of poise and stamina by Helen Mirren. Oh she's a force to be reckoned with as a star and as a character that she's playing and she's a practitioner of alchemy. This might already be subversive  in that time and era women like that were branded witches right away but here it's something that is not only encouraged but flaunted  but then comes more 'colorful' though normal elements of explorers washed up on the shore and part of the King's army of sorts Alfred Molina and Chris Cooper make up some of this bunch.There's also a love story thrown in the mix between the two youngest members of the cast actors whom I'm sorry to say I don't remember their names as they are kind of forgettable due to the script and Taymor's direction of them. I get the sense that among the rest of what she has to work with this is either the thing she's least concerned with or she botched this part of the film. I didn't really buy any of this younglove stuff not the interactions or the dippy acting or even to go back to the source if it's that Shakespeare's dialog. This and a few other odd moments such as a few scenes with CGI some of it though not all of it with Ben Whishaw's spirit character Ariel who is up there with the clouds and the smoke of air do detract from the quality of the rest of the film.The rest of it I should add is a lot of fun and extraordinary to take in. Djimon Hunsou makes his Caliban a terrifying but oddly sympathetic character one who will do bad things and can the scar on his face says 'Don't mess with me Whitey' pretty clearly even if it's said in oldschool Bard speak but has also been damaged over time. There is some depth there that isn't with some of the other supporting characters as interesting as they are and acted as well as they are. Among the lot that I've mentioned and who are really excellent in scenes that just need plenty of good closeups and not too much music Molina Cooper and a magnetic David Straitharn take up really good chunks of screen time.The oddity here is Russell Brand. Appearing as himself or what I can figure is himself after playing a similar crazy rockandroll type in Judd Apatow comedies here he's kind of the Fool character Trinculo and it was kind of delightfully bizarre to see him here doing his thing with such gusto and humor. Maybe that was Taymor's intention as with Mirren as Prospera in a way to give this work that is centuries old and dealing with the aspect of PostColonial theory a modern uplift and change up the nature of the characters without taking too much away from their roots. But more to the point one of the strengths of the film and that Taymor connected with is that Prospera's an artist in her own right only with magic and may be reckless with her 'art' but will go to the lengths that she will do to her will. An extreme example but I have to wonder if what Taymor is doing here as all over the place and great and notsogreat as it is in its broad strokes its a really raw expression of her own art through this flawed exmember of royalty.Taymor's work is an acquired taste as the euphemism goes another way of saying go in at your own risk. The wild takes on setpieces like the shipcrash the trippyhallucinogenic visions of characters and the eccentric acting turn the Tempest into a curious delight but you need to expect something like that. This is Shakespeare for the Modern Museum of Art group not for stuffy intellectuals looking for Masterpiece theater. For its faults some of them crucial its alive and throbbing and that's good to have in this Awards season.".

Kudos as well to the everwatchable David Strathairn and Djimon Hounsou.What annoys? Now we enter very subjective ground. This beautiful deceptively simple play is turned into an amped up to the max loud and frantic film. The electric guitar whines are painfully out of place and Russell Brand never guilty of subtlety on a good day will make you claw your own eardrums out. It's almost as if Taymor had forgotten we were right there with her cast right behind the camera instead of sitting 50ft back in a packed theater.This has proved an incredibly divisive film and I feel split right down the middle on it. I admire Titus in my mind one of the best Shakespeare adaptations in history but whereas Taymor's turbocharged visuals and loud often trashy use of sound and effects served as a perfect illustration for Shakesepare's bonkers gorefest it diminishes the more mature heartfelt qualities of this play. The Tempest is a great playwright's swan song the work of an aging mature artist. Why would you give us an overly loud ADDafflicted MTV version? Ultimately this frustrating missed opportunity makes you wonder did Taymor have her Shakespeare mixed up all along.

The visuals are spectacular right from the palaces towers columns and the scenery itself helped by wellabove average effects and sweeping cinematography.

	schema:headline " Zapped magic";
	schema:reviewBody "The Tempest is not the most riveting drama the larger realization is after all a certain weariness with it. This is given to us as a magician who halfway through the story abandons his powers of illusion who after conjuring to him the characters and plotting the story of revenge pauses to reflect on the emptiness of the endeavor. It's still powerful then because we are all Prosperos alone in our island with the thoughts we conjure up to inhabit.In Shakespeare's time the inspiration for Prospero must have likely come from the scandalous topic of John Dee the communion with spirits and visions through crystals certainly point at that as well as more broadly the notion of a benign magic. Magic since well before Dee and up to Crowley has tried its best to mask in so much hoopla what other spiritual traditions make clear from the start that man is an embodied consciousness with the ability to direct that consciousness to vision. Shakespeare no doubt understood this was exactly his own art a rich and complicated magic of conjured vision in peoples' minds.So if this is to be powerful you have to adopt a very intricate stance.

	onyx:emotionText "The Tempest is not the most riveting drama the larger realization is after all a certain weariness with it. This is given to us as a magician who halfway through the story abandons his powers of illusion who after conjuring to him the characters and plotting the story of revenge pauses to reflect on the emptiness of the endeavor. It's still powerful then because we are all Prosperos alone in our island with the thoughts we conjure up to inhabit.In Shakespeare's time the inspiration for Prospero must have likely come from the scandalous topic of John Dee the communion with spirits and visions through crystals certainly point at that as well as more broadly the notion of a benign magic. Magic since well before Dee and up to Crowley has tried its best to mask in so much hoopla what other spiritual traditions make clear from the start that man is an embodied consciousness with the ability to direct that consciousness to vision. Shakespeare no doubt understood this was exactly his own art a rich and complicated magic of conjured vision in peoples' minds.So if this is to be powerful you have to adopt a very intricate stance. Show both the power of illusion as vision and contradictory the emptiness of it the fact it is underpinned by an illusory nature of reality. Greenaway masterfully did this in his Prospero film by having Prospero's creation of the play as vision the vision lush and wonderful and yet at every turn shown to exist on a stage.Taymor is too earnest to strike this stance in fact judging by the cinematic fabrics here she seems unsure of what direction to follow.

	schema:reviewBody "Shakespeare's last play The Tempest tells the tale of a sorcerer  Prospera and her daughter who have been cast off and banished and find  themselves on a barren island where she takes Caliban as her slave.  Many years later she creates a tempest to wreck the ship carrying those  that banished her and the survivors of the ship find themselves on the  island including the kings son who falls for Prospera's daughter. Throw  in a spirit slave who helps Prospera bring the newcomers to her and the  slaves of the King who side with Caliban to destroy Prospera and you  have a real blend of genres.  Julie Taymor brings another Shakespeare play to the big screen after  her magnificent version of Titus. The Tempest is really a blend of  drama romance fantasy and comedy and with it's supernatural and  magical elements it's quite a story to bring to the big screen.  Changing the lead of Prospero to a female role makes little difference  and Helen Mirren as Prospera is very good but performance wise she is  the only standout with the rest of the cast going through the paces  and casting Russel Brand as the jester does not bring enough light  relief and makes me wonder since when did Russel Brand become an actor?  Taymor tries to makes this as natural as possible but that's difficult  to achieve with it's fantastical elements and many of the these moments  fail including the spirit Ariel whose appearances are like Caspar The  Ghost and only when he appears as a sign of madness to the king and his  men as a dark ominous bird does the fantasy finally work. The film also  feels stilted at times and for something that contains so much fantasy  and magic it feels for the most part bland and dull and bad use of  music much of which sounds like something from a bad rock music  doesn't help achieve anything.  Interesting use of landscapes and Mirren's performance are worthy  elements but that's not enough to redeem the film which with Taymor at  the helm doesn't work nearly as well as her previous efforts.".

Some where along the way she made a film that seems so technically inept as to not really be viewable.Having assembled a cast that on paper should have worked she's proceeded to make a film where everyone seems to be alone on screen. For me it was as if she had cut together performances from different films.Having changed the male lead to a woman she failed to change all of the language and periodically you get lines of dialog that just play wrong.There are frequent mismatched shots as objects move around bottle tops appear and disappear and characters seem to be taking readings from different takes or set ups.I shouldn't have been noticing all the mistakes I should have been surfing on the plot and the dialog but Taymor never manages to create any sort of magic. And any magic is supplied by cheap visual effects. I don't know. I had such high hopes for the film but nothing came together. In a weird way the film is best summed up by Ben Whishaw's Ariel who is required to play the part naked however is forced to go through the most ludicrous gyrations to cover up his privates The audience I saw this with was roaring with each uncomfortable twist.2 out of 10 for the performances that work on their own terms one just wishes that they had been brought together to actually resemble a film.".

More than the usual Greek islands these locations project power and isolation. The other actors try their best but the men don't excel. Djimon Hounsou gives a reasonably beastly performance.

More than the usual Greek islands these locations project power and isolation. The other actors try their best but the men don't excel. Djimon Hounsou gives a reasonably beastly performance. Felicity Jones is overshadowed by Helen Mirren. Other than the locations I don't have anything outstanding to stake my review on.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Tempest opens with a shot a sand castle that melts away when water rains down upon it. This shot is probably one of the most interesting ones in the entire film even if Julie Taymor has so brilliantly made every shot beautiful. It also is a really great shot because it is silent with the exception of the sound of the rain. And that is the major problem with this film. The acting and cinematography are fairly solid but a good portion of the film is extremely hard to understand due to fastmoving Shakespearian English. Some of the film also ventures into the realm of the bizarre with an odd electric score and overly long special effects sequences. The Tempest is not bad Julie Taymor could have done better.The Tempest's somewhat simple and yet somewhat complicated story follows Prospera Helen Mirren and her daughter Miranda Felicity Jones. That's right. Taymor changed Prospero's gender for this one. Prospera was banished from Milan where she was believed to be practicing black magic. Her brother sent her off in a boat with Miranda and she ended up on a deserted island. Prospera plans to bring Miranda back to power in Milan through manipulation and trickery. To begin executing her plan she summons a storm that brings her brother and the King of Naples to her island. A great supporting cast includes Alan Cumming Djimon Hounsou Russell Brand and Chris Cooper.It may be impossible for Julie Taymor to compose a beautiful shot. Though I was not a fan of the special effects everything that was shown was interesting. Stick around for the credits which are set to shots of books falling through water. This a simple but specific example of some of Taymor's best work in this film.The acting is also great in this. Helen Mirren shines as Prospera a role that could have been made for her 400 years ago by Shakespeare. I have no idea why Taymor decided to change Prospero's gender but it was all worth it just to see Mirren play her. Djimon Hounsou is also excellent as Caliban a powerhungry slave that attempts to form a conspiracy to overthrow Prospera. Among one of the biggest surprises is Russell Brand. Brand who often plays dirty rock stars in movies such as Get Him to the Greek and Forgetting Sarah Marshall gets sort of serious as a drunk who teams up with Caliban.Unfortunately the film is rather hard to understand. The sound was horrible but I am not totally sure that the version I saw was completely finished. Any dialogue in the first five minutes was inaudible because the sound of the waves crashing on the ship was so loud. On top of this Taymor has written a masterful but difficult script in Shakespearian English. Die hard Shakespeare fans may be pleased but most other people will be lost for most of the movie.Sometimes directors start making mistakes when they try to get experimental. That is what may have happened with The Tempest. Taymor had so much potential to make a great film but what came out in the end was a goodlooking but tiresome movie. The acting is phenomenal but the sound is not. The cinematography is great but the script cannot match it. For Shakespeare fans The Tempest is a mustsee but for everyone else it is probably only a rental.Note This was seen at the New York Film Festival. The sound may have still been unfinished at this screening.".

	schema:headline " Intriguing concept that didn't work for me";
	schema:reviewBody "The Tempest 2010I was directed by Julie Taymor who also wrote the screenplay. The play was of course written by William Shakespeare.There is a long tradition of women playing male roles in Shakespeare's plays. The great Sarah Bernhardt played Hamlet in the 19th Century and at Stratford Ontario Seanna McKenna played Richard III. I saw McKenna in Richard III and she was incredible.However for this Tempest Julie Taymor directs Helen Mirren as Prospera a woman rather than Prospero a man. Mirren is such a superb actor that I think she could have played Prospero but that isn't what happened. Changing the gender of the principal character in your story is a risky business. The whole concept of The Tempest is that Prospero was the Duke of Milan. He wasn't Duchess of Milan. On the island where he is marooned Prospero is lord and master. His relationship with Miranda is one of father and daughter. It's hard to think of Prospero as a woman.Having seen The Tempest many times I've come to expect an older male actor playing the role. The classic Shakespearean progression is Romeo to Hamlet to Macbeth to Lear and Prospero. So despite Mirren's skills I simply couldn't adjust to a woman in the part.Also of course the relationship between father and daughter and mother and daughter is often very different. So changing Prospero's name to Prospera isn't just a matter of a name. It's made The Tempest into a very different story. And in my opinion it's definitely not the story that Shakespeare wrote.Although I have a high regard for both Helen Mirren and Julie Taymor I think this was a concept that just didn't work. Directors and actors have always modified Shakespeare according to their thoughts about what the plays mean. You can push and stretch a Shakespearean play a long long way and still have it be Shakespeare. However in this case it's not Shakespeare it's Taymor. It's an interesting movie but It's not the Tempest.At the time I wrote this review the IMDb rating for the movie was 5.4. I've never seen a serious film with this low a rating. Apparently almost no one liked the concept. I gave the film a rating of 7.0. It's not great cinema but it's better than a 5.4.".

	schema:headline " Taymor's Tempest";
	schema:reviewBody "Evil monsters witches nature spirits dashing princes and damsels in distress sounds like all the appropriate ingredients for every beloved fantastical tale we read as children. But a children's story this is not. Julie Taymor's 2010 film adaptation of Shakespeare's The Tempest is chock full of those deep dark questions we as adults struggle within the scope of our lives. In a new spin on an old classic Taymor makes us question our personal family ties loyalty revenge and forgiveness. This modern film stayed to Shakespeare's iconic tale of aristocratic parent and child exiled from their home by an ambitious relative. They are washed up on a mysterious magical island after enduring a cataclysmic storm. For nearly twelve years the pair must establish civilization making both friend and foe along the way. Also the language stayed very true to the original Shakespearean. While some may assume this would inhibit understanding the film the storyline was very simple to follow because of the brilliant acting camera work costumes and set design. I would be completely remiss if I did not note the most strikingly obvious deviation Taymor made from the original Prospero becomes Prospera. That's right instead of being shipwrecked with her father for her entire life Miranda is accompanied by her mother. The motherdaughter dynamic puts an entirely different spin on all of the interactions these two characters share. A shrewd mother who tests a potential suitor for her daughter in hopes to find a good match for her daughter is much more believable to a modern audience. We come from a world where fathers are often depicted as extremely reluctant to release their hold of protection over their daughters to a potential male companion very different in Shakespeare's time. Mothers are often the natural buffer to allow this transfer to occur. It was brilliant to see Helen Mirren fulfilling the strong emotional role as both father and mother to Miranda's character another theme very accessible to viewers today. Another character that has always eluded readers is that of the indefinable Caliban. Every stage and film adaptation of this play chooses to depict our menacingly evil or perhaps tragically misunderstood antagonist. Usually Caliban bears some resemblance to a savage beast as he is the offspring of a malevolent witch. Djimon Hounsou was an exceptional casting choice for Caliban as he flawlessly portrayed the tortured soul of his character. The costuming choices were also brilliant as Caliban's conflicted nature was captured by depicting him as multiracial covered in patches of every shade of skin tone two differently colored eyes and scantily clad in an indigenous looking loin cloth. The camera work and set design were also breathtaking as the beauty of an exotic Mediterranean island was perfectly captured. Frequent use of wide camera angles to capture the sheer majesty of the island allowed the audience to believe that magic truly could exist in a place like this. And within an instant we saw this tropical dream paradise change into a raging torrential nightmare as the tempest moved in. Overall Taymor achieved an excellent balance of making tribute to a timeless Shakespearean classic while still adapting certain aspects of the tale to appeal to modern audiences. And if at any point you may feel daunted by the deep philosophical questions or challenging Shakespearean language this film possesses don't fret. At any moment a hilariously intoxicated Russell Brand as Trinculo will be popping out from around the corner to provide some hysterical comic relief!".

I thought that it was a mistake to make the casting of Caliban an African man although he was disguised with scales and what looked like vertiligo. The purists see this play as about man's fear of anything differentthe other and this plays into the post colonial criticisms by making the man black. Although Ben Wishaw did a sterling job as Ariel it was a bit disconcerting to see his thin body running around naked.

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes one can only laugh overbearingly at the user comments here. You can rest assured that those who rate this movie poorly do not know a good film adaptation of Shakespeare when they see one.It is not an entirely perfect movie. I can mention a number of things that might have been done a bit better. Ferdinand although supposed to be delicate should also be more forceful than he was here. I appreciate that Taymor based his appearance on the famous Millais painting but I thought he came across as slightly too dainty and effeminate. Oh well for someone who dreams of a quiet life I suppose it's all right.Although Tom Conti's Gonzalo and Alfred Molina's Stefano were good I also felt the rest of the characters  even Prospera  lacked a certain passion Brand was okay as Trinculo but not quite as charismatic as I would have liked. Miranda was almost as good as we have any right to expect but the only real standout character who displayed proper passion was Caliban. Most definitely the most successful version of the character I have seen yet. Much the same goes for Ariel who was very close to how I've always imagined him.I could mention other occasional shortcomings  textual cuts a speech that did not have maximum effect a comical scene that wasn't all that comical etc.  but the fact of the matter is that this adaptation was a thing of beauty. Being a stage designer for opera productions Taymor understands how to create a simultaneously modern and poetic environment stuffed with stylish imagery. I loved the sounds effects and the visual effects equally and have long yearned to see such a version of The Tempest. So this makes me very happy.Several scenes represented thoughtful ideas about interpretation just like a good production should. A new detail it alerted me to was when Prospera says of Caliban towards the end this thing of darkness I acknowledge mine. I have always thought that this line meant that Prospero acknowledged Caliban as being a part of him something integral to him. But in this production we have a situation where several characters try to explain who they are and Prospera's words may simply identify Caliban as one of her subjects with no further meaning. Taymor latterly has Caliban leave Prospera's cell much like Lucius left for the sunset with Aaron's child in Titus which suggests a different and intriguing reading of the scene. After all Prospera is returning to Milan so what can happen to Caliban other than that he receives his freedom? Neat methinks!With its several shortcomings one could argue that the film deserves an 7 rating rather than a 8 but what pushed it towards a 8 for me was the incredible beauty of the sung version of the epilogue during the end credits. It was even done in a voice that could be mistaken for Helen Mirren's which I thought was a splendid touch.All in all a splendid and satisfying if imperfect adaptation that I know I will watch often on DVD. It is the best version of the play yet made.8 stars out of 10.".

I can mention a number of things that might have been done a bit better. Ferdinand although supposed to be delicate should also be more forceful than he was here. I appreciate that Taymor based his appearance on the famous Millais painting but I thought he came across as slightly too dainty and effeminate. Oh well for someone who dreams of a quiet life I suppose it's all right.Although Tom Conti's Gonzalo and Alfred Molina's Stefano were good I also felt the rest of the characters  even Prospera  lacked a certain passion Brand was okay as Trinculo but not quite as charismatic as I would have liked. Miranda was almost as good as we have any right to expect but the only real standout character who displayed proper passion was Caliban. Most definitely the most successful version of the character I have seen yet. Much the same goes for Ariel who was very close to how I've always imagined him.I could mention other occasional shortcomings  textual cuts a speech that did not have maximum effect a comical scene that wasn't all that comical etc.  but the fact of the matter is that this adaptation was a thing of beauty. Being a stage designer for opera productions Taymor understands how to create a simultaneously modern and poetic environment stuffed with stylish imagery. I loved the sounds effects and the visual effects equally and have long yearned to see such a version of The Tempest. So this makes me very happy.Several scenes represented thoughtful ideas about interpretation just like a good production should. A new detail it alerted me to was when Prospera says of Caliban towards the end this thing of darkness I acknowledge mine. I have always thought that this line meant that Prospero acknowledged Caliban as being a part of him something integral to him. But in this production we have a situation where several characters try to explain who they are and Prospera's words may simply identify Caliban as one of her subjects with no further meaning. Taymor latterly has Caliban leave Prospera's cell much like Lucius left for the sunset with Aaron's child in Titus which suggests a different and intriguing reading of the scene. After all Prospera is returning to Milan so what can happen to Caliban other than that he receives his freedom? Neat methinks!With its several shortcomings one could argue that the film deserves an 7 rating rather than a 8 but what pushed it towards a 8 for me was the incredible beauty of the sung version of the epilogue during the end credits. It was even done in a voice that could be mistaken for Helen Mirren's which I thought was a splendid touch.All in all a splendid and satisfying if imperfect adaptation that I know I will watch often on DVD. It is the best version of the play yet made.8 stars out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "In my mind Shakespeare's Tempest is the least graceful of all his works that I have experienced. His genreconfused hodgepodge of plots and characters while proving Shakespeare's genius to an audience which needs no such proof serves only to render it atmospherically mutilated. It's as if Shakespeare had three equally tedious slogs and decided to combine them with the sentiment that the whole would be greater than the sum of its parts.But with The Tempest Taymor does the impossible She takes Shakespeare's debacle and makes it worse. Even as a nonaesthete one who appreciates bad CGI when bad CGI is due I found myself plunging through biting aesthetic pain whenever Taymor made the choice to use it. Taymor's failure to capture the already weak atmosphere of The Tempest is simply embarrassing. Each frame is drained of colour bland as the characters and the story which fill them and the CGI is curiously funny although I highly doubt that was what Taymor was going for. Perhaps she sought to bring her own style into the film but as demonstrated by her directorial ineptitude in the making of this film it would probably be better for her to keep a minimal personal influence letting Shakespeare do the talking instead.Taymor seeks to win over her audience through a pointless gender swap adopting the I'm original attitude of one whose only originality resides in turning celebrated literature into films. Instead of the magician Prospero we instead get the magician Prospera played by Helen Mirren. Wow. Every other character remains the same. Some idiot made the mistake of casting a black guy as Caliban. As makeupencrusted as he is that doesn't take away from the fact that the only black guy in this whole movie plays the slave.In accord with Shakespeare The Tempest is narratively befuddled. Three separate plots are superficially explored in under two hours. And yet as each plodding second passes one could be forgiven for assuming that it is longer. Overall Taymor's The Tempest was awful buoyed only by a few performances and the occasional fancy shot. I found myself wanting to die to sleep.Ay there's the rub.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a wonderful sports film. STOP read that line one more time. I ask you to do this because you will probably never see this again.This was a sports film for me to say that it wasn't would be a bold faced lie. This had all the characteristics of the modern Hollywood sports film but what made it stand out and enjoyable is that it did not take itself seriously  AND  it had some amazing CGI action sequences. I recently watched a film called Equilibrium where it was mentioned that it could rival the popularity of The Matrix well I would have to say that perhaps this film Siu lam juk kau would probably do more in toppling the king of bullettime cinematography than Equilibrium would. I was impressed from the beginning till the end of this movie. The characters were all animated and individual in their own way. There was time used to set them up and learn about each of them. This wasn't one of those films where you spent most of your time with one of the characters then never really got to know the rest of them  you knew them all and couldn't wait to see what they were going to bring to the table next. Hong Kong has crafted a spectacular film here. They have taken the popularity of the bullettime effect and applied it to a genre that definitely needed a facelift. I am surprised that America wasn't the first to do this but we are a nation that loves the standard sports film so why change what we love. PWFSSSST. We are so lazy sometimes.Siu lam juk kau tells a spectacular story coupled with some amazing graphics to create a story about love teamwork and superpowers. I also enjoyed the fact that this film also tried to say that kungfu is not an old topic that it can and should still be used in society today. When we think of the martial arts films and physical aspect we see them as a very old and dated genre. Well let me be the first to say that they are coming back and coming back with a vengeance. I enjoyed the fact that this was a revenge film. So many of our kungfu films are revenge films I was happy to see that this one was not far off. This film used techniques that I have not seen used in any other films. They took the old skillful ways of the dated kungfu film added the work of bullettime and added the sports flare to it to create Siu lam juk kau. It had us laughing it kept us based in reality and it focused my attention to the screen for the entire film a task that no other sports film has been able to do. I think that by having your star also direct it directed and starred Stephen Chow it builds upon a sense of comfortability with the story. Chow is a master of slapstick yet seldom overdoes the silliness choosing carefully timed gags and meticulously mounted visual construction over slapdash comedy. The film is also no stranger to the bizarre with Chow's multiple homages to Steven Spielberg and a weird egg gag that I'm honestly shocked still remains the American cut of the picture.Overall Siu lam juk kau is a amazing combination of comedy action romance and dazzling soccer footage forming an irresistible package to those looking for something they haven't seen before. We see that it is a personal story that everyone is having fun being a part of. That also helped this film  the characters really wanted to be in this film and it shined like the North Star through our screen. The dubbing which seemed off a couple times only added delight to this film. Chow's Siu lam juk kau is and will always be breathtaking.Grade  out of ".

I also enjoyed the fact that this film also tried to say that kungfu is not an old topic that it can and should still be used in society today. When we think of the martial arts films and physical aspect we see them as a very old and dated genre. Well let me be the first to say that they are coming back and coming back with a vengeance. I enjoyed the fact that this was a revenge film. So many of our kungfu films are revenge films I was happy to see that this one was not far off. This film used techniques that I have not seen used in any other films. They took the old skillful ways of the dated kungfu film added the work of bullettime and added the sports flare to it to create Siu lam juk kau. It had us laughing it kept us based in reality and it focused my attention to the screen for the entire film a task that no other sports film has been able to do. I think that by having your star also direct it directed and starred Stephen Chow it builds upon a sense of comfortability with the story. Chow is a master of slapstick yet seldom overdoes the silliness choosing carefully timed gags and meticulously mounted visual construction over slapdash comedy. The film is also no stranger to the bizarre with Chow's multiple homages to Steven Spielberg and a weird egg gag that I'm honestly shocked still remains the American cut of the picture.Overall Siu lam juk kau is a amazing combination of comedy action romance and dazzling soccer footage forming an irresistible package to those looking for something they haven't seen before. We see that it is a personal story that everyone is having fun being a part of. That also helped this film  the characters really wanted to be in this film and it shined like the North Star through our screen. The dubbing which seemed off a couple times only added delight to this film. Chow's Siu lam juk kau is and will always be breathtaking.Grade  out of ";

My initial disappointment with the dubbing I am a subtitle diehard was soon overcome with admiration of how far HK cinema has come. Imagine the FX expertise of the Matrix with the comedy of Jackie Chan fused into a somewhat generic football film. In a word a brilliantly scripted and often funny film. Many moments are extremely funny with the overthetop storyline made famous by HK and also the very touching moments with the acneridden baker girllove interest as she is only accepted for what she is. It feels as if there is more to the love story in the original cut of the film as the story occasionally skipped in places like a bad DVD. But the overall story is not affected it moves sedately at first which is good as the excessive use of Kungfu and Football are shown in increasingly ridiculous stages. The final goal reminds me of HotShot Hamish for those that read the comics. Worth seeing and I can't wait for the DVD  providing it has the original cut and subtitles.".

Despite its disparity with western comedy Shaolin Soccer still does its job of conveying laughter to its viewers. The story is original as well something that Hollywood has not been able to come up in a very long time except for a few. The story is not funny per se but what is wonderful about this movie is that each one of the characters is fully embraced by its respective actors. For example the goalkeeper alluding the ever great Bruce Lee. His facial expression and actions bring for a moment the late Bruce Lee to an audience that has been longing for his presence in the big screen Bruce Lee fans remember I am not saying that he is as great as Bruce Lee is but that his actions are reminiscent of him. I applaud this funny yet intelligent movie with the hope that in the near future American audiences can widely appreciate other foreign movies more.

There were some things I didn't understand though specifically how Miu became gorgeous which she was even with a bald head and how Miu got into the final game.So the next night I watched the Original version hoping there might be some explanations. There weren't. The only explanation I can think of how Miu became gorgeous is that someone told her she is beautiful so she became beautiful. But how she got into the final game is still a mystery. But it is just a mere detail.Anyway the reasons I liked the Miramax cut better were that it cut out stuff that was not integral to the movie. Such as Golden Leg admiring Mighty Steel Leg's apartment.Miramax also cut the scenes of Miu being friendly with the team and the scene in which Miu stands up to her boss. Miu standing up to her boss was a great scene and let us see more of Miu's mastery. However the boss not firing her after that was the most unbelievable thing in this movie of fantasy. I think Miramax did good to cut the scene so the movie would make a little more sense as to why Miu still had a job before being fired for making salty and bitter buns.The Miramax cut also added special touches such as the signs being in English. No Peeing on the Wall looked funnier to me than Chinese characters did. Another addition to the Miramax cut that I found to be a funny moment moreso than in the Original version was the cellphone call Iron Shirt made during the final game. In the original version he just called a girl to tell her he loved her. In the Miramax version he poured out his heart saying I love you only to find out he was talking to a man. He then said something like Please tell your wife what I just told you. It was classic.Anyway all in all they were both very good versions. So whichever one you get to see please see it.".

The title 'Shaolin Soccer' the synopsis the box art etc were not promising I was expecting the usual cliched Bmovie Fallen star brings together ragtag gang of outsiders trains them up allowing them to bond and then usual finish beating the evil favourites. Right that's enough of the bad preconceptions. This film is BRILLIANT 'scuse the caps. Although the story is technically pretty cliched it is executed flawlessly and as other reviewers have mentioned  this is a comedy and a very funny one at that. It's not deep it's not going to win an Oscar  but I just sat through it with a great big grin slapped on my face laughing my arse off. Think Escape to VictoryJackie ChanMatrix effects  actually the effects do deserve a mention. I'd somehow got the idea that China was somehow going to produce crappy bluescreen special effects not at all true. Film is crammed with some very nice effects which are completely OTT but add enormously to the overall impact of the film. Enough of my pointless rambling anyway. Please get a group of your mates round crack open a few beers and watch this film  I promise you you won't regret it.".

Although he's not exactly from brilliant yet the direction has improved vastly. And the new CG scenes are often amusing and visually interesting demanding repetitive viewings.While the film is fun and generally smart it falls prey to a bit of an obvious story of course this is one of those littleplot highlaugh comedies One can't help be feel bogged down by some of the love plot which unlike a lot of the soccer field action it's totally predictable and at times is a bore.If you must see Shaolin Soccer be sure to watch it with it's original language and subtitles. The American English version had many of the films funniest scenes cut to make the film more PG13 rating.

It has a story about love a really good one like in a romantic movie and it has a story about friendship like in many kinds of movies. It surely has some other stories which I won't tell. Here Stephen Chow took the amazing work of creating a story involving real characters in not so real but agreeable situations. He has given each character a personality of its own just to create comedy with a humor that is sometimes honest and others rough. It has some great comedy moments although coming from the characters very peculiar ones.It basically all comes from the characters. You have different persons united by one thing Shaolin KungFu. And then you have one man with one passion Soccer. This premise helps to create human emotions in the characters. They all have a past that for some reason want to forget. Except one of them who could be living in the past and still thinks in the goodness of Shaolin KungFu. He believes in it so much that he gives speeches to people about the qualities of his culture and the improvement it could do in society. He is right and sooner or later she will remind these things to some people and they will all remember. They will all be prepared to get together again.What a goodhearted film this is and how it is filmed it's beyond imagination. You will find special effects from other world. In occasions these will seem slow for you and you will think they are not well managed or handled but then you will watch. Watching will make you connect all the elements of the story to make it one. In elements I include special effects and say again they couldn't be done better especially in a movie like this one.The actors do a great job the entire cast. They give their characters the personal development they need. They are not playing the most complex people in the world but they still know what characters they're playing.You will probably find something you've seen before I can't deny that. You will find the ending you expect the situations you imagine the resolutions you anticipate or not. You'll have the old coach the person with the dreams and the heart the girl it's just that you'll have them differently you'll realize what I mean.The truth is that in a world full of clichs this is another type of clich. A very different one. So different that I would say it is not a clich at all.".

Then the team set out to help Fung achieve his life long dream to win the coveted China Super Cup from Team Evil.I absolutely loved this movie I thought it was a brilliantly writtenwell directed piece of actioncomedy.This stands as the first movie I have ever seen starring the brilliantly dead pan Stephen Chow.  was put off from seeing his previous movies because the humour was very local to his native Hong Kong but viewing this movie it's interesting to see that a lot of the humour has not lost it's touch through the translation. I feel Chow is starting to in someways play to his overseas fans who may not speak Cantonese because I found myself to my relief that I was laughing at a lot of the jokes some physical others verbal.The acting in this was brilliant though the part played by Vicky Zhao could have been a little better she served as Chow's love interest in the movie but she never got to do a whole lot except look sad in most of the scenes she was in.But the rest of the cast was great from Kwok Kuen Chan as the goal keeper who has a frightening resemblance to the late great Bruce Lee to Man Tat Ng as the hapless Fung. It's also worth mentioning that Patrick TseFather of Hong Kong superstar Nicholas Tse does a great job as the chillingly cool villain of the movie.Now let's talk about the action. It's basically wire kung fu mixed with CGI which in some ways I'm not a huge fan of but in this particular film it works because this story feels a lot like a comic book even though that really wasn't Chow's original intention for the film. I thought the scenes where excellently put together and it never dampened my enjoyment of the movie.overall this is an extremely fun enjoyable movie which delivers in all aspects. Don't go and view this movie expecting a grounded realistic martial art extravaganza as you'll be sorely disappointed but if you have seen movies such as The Storm Riders The Duel and Volcano High this is the movie for you.".

The story is well designed believable and convincing and the characters will prove to be very complex. I loved the way comedy combined with drama and action. But what truly amazed me were the stunts and the martial arts. The special effects make the already impressive and beautiful art of Kung Fu look even more aweinducing and fantastic. The ending was good and sweet but also extremely artistic. Overall I would say this is a fantastic movie and I recommend it to both sports and kung fu lovers alike.

This movie will make you happy sad at some parts but it will also make you understand. At the end I am sure you will bear a big smile.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is just so fun to watch. Some parts of it are a bit strange to my American eyes but that's fine with me. The story follows a perfect arc and the action scenes just get better and better as the movie goes on. The final scene makes a perfect ending for the movie.Currently the Miramax DVD of this movie is available really inexpensively. This DVD has both the American cut and the original Chinese cut and I have watched both. The American version chops out a lot of background plot material and a few slower scenes and also some of the jokes that look odd to an American it also adds in some material that was cut from the Chinese version. Overall I didn't mind the American version too much but then my favorite scene came up and I discovered they had axed the original excellent music in favor of a bad cover of Kung Fu Fighting this is a heinous crime. If you are interested in just how much music can affect the mood of a scene first watch the Chinese version and then watch the final scene in the American version.I also really love the music and I plan to buy the soundtrack. It's only available as in import from Japan.I rate this movie 10 out of 10. I have watched it several times in quick succession and I'm still not tired of it. If you like fun action movies with comedy definitely give this a chance.Mild spoilers followI really enjoy the scenes where Mui uses her Tai Chi. Where the men of the movie use linear forceonforce style martial arts Mui uses a circular style.There is a sort of dance number that was cut from the Chinese version but is present in the American version. If you want to see it watch the American version it comes when the main character meets Mui for the first time. There are no Deleted Scenes or any other special features in the Miramax DVD so that's the only way to see the scene.".

Have you seen Paradise Hawaiian Style of Harum Scarum lately? This was the brief period in Elvis' career when he was taken somewhat seriously by his directors and fellow cast members. Elvis really tried too before giving up and giving in to the Colonel and a parade of bad scripts and horrible soundtracks. The late Judy Tyler is great in this movie and the songs are pure early Elvis good old Rock and Roll! A favorite is You're so Square Baby I don't care. Check out the dance sequence for the song Jailhouse Rock. It's Elvis at his swivel hipped best. Chowderhead you must be a huge Pat Boone fan and although he is still a wonderful talent I wouldn't say he is a hundred times better than Elvis! Debby Boone'e You Light Up MY Life is HIP? Get real! And Little Richard has no talent? Stay off the caffiene and chill out. You'll feel better. By the way Pat Boone NEVER recorded Hound Dog so how could his version outsell Elvis? Get your facts straight. Better yet rent a video or DVD of Jailhouse Rock and this time watch it with your eyes open.".

Berman who among other folks he produced for was Fred Astaire and director Richard Thorpe. He was one of MGM's busiest craftsmen who directed just about every MGM star during that studio's golden years. As he always did Colonel Parker made sure that his star got the best possible support and he didn't fail him in Jailhouse Rock.In Jailhouse Rock Elvis plays a rather surly ill tempered youth whose quick with his fists. A brawl in a bar and Elvis kills a guy with his fists. Granted the deceased was a lout still the state does frown on that and Elvis got a term for manslaughter. While there he shares a cell with old time country singer Mickey Shaughnessy. Mickey helps Elvis survive prison and discovers he's got a voice. When he's released before Shaughnessy Elvis goes out in search of a career and determined to let nothing stand in his way. He discovers the music business is a cutthroat one and he responds in kind. He gets his success but it costs him the love and respect of all around him including young record promoter Judy Tyler who develops a thing for the king.Elvis has some good songs to sing with the title song being the biggest hit from this film. Jailhouse Rock is given a good MGM style production worthy of anything you might have seen MGM give one of Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly's musicals. And the record of course is still selling good.Mickey Shaughnessy appeared in a lot of good films in the Fifties but usually playing cheerful oafs. This was one of the few times he had a serious part and he carries it off well.I was disappointed that Judy Tyler did not get to display her musical talents. Elvis's is not the only tragic story from the cast of Jailhouse Rock. Young Judy Tyler with a brilliant career in front of her was killed shortly after completing this film with her husband in an automobile accident. I remember it well because she had been Princess SummerFallWinterSpring on the Howdy Doody Show a few years earlier. After leaving that she got good notices on Broadway in one of RodgersHammerstein's lesser shows Pipe Dream. My guess is that Colonel Tom did not want anyone sharing musical time with Elvis so early in his career. Otherwise she might have gotten a number on her own and a duet with the king. Her musical talent would have been preserved in a hit film but who could have known? Elvis would have to wait until Viva Las Vegas and AnnMargret before he got a leading lady who could sing and dance to match him.The plot of the film is similar to The Carpetbaggers so if you've seen that you know how this one comes out. Elvis does a fine acting job and singing well he is the king.".

	schema:headline " A pop culture time capsule from the late 1950's decade";
	schema:reviewBody "Jailhouse Rock is an entertaining film which Elvis Presley its star carries all the way.  Judy Tyler is gorgeous as a love interest and Mickey Shaughnessy is tough but goodhearted as his jailhouse buddy.  They provide good support.  This is an early film for Elvis maybe only his second film after his debut in Love Me Tender.  This movie felt like a  pop culture time capsule from the late fifties era with the clothes the music and the cars.  It is a forerunner of many Elvis films of the same type where Elvis sings overcomes obstacles and gets the girl and yet it has the charm and innocence often typical in this era.  The concept is still fresh in 1957 and it shows in Elvis's performance which is good.  The plot is a bit weak in places but passable. Jailhouse Rock features roughly half a dozen performances by Elvis and they all add to the fun.  There are also one or two numbers by  costar Mickey Shaughnessy and they also enhance  the film. This is one of the more substantial Elvis Films and a good one to watch to introduce you to the phenomenon of Elvis Presley.  Sadly Elvis's lovely costar Judy Tyler was killed in an automobile accident before the film was released in theaters.  It has been said that Elvis refused to watch Jailhouse Rock ever again after Judy's death.  I give this movie an 82100 points.".

	schema:reviewBody "Elvis Presley plays Vince Everett who goes to jail after accidentally killing a man in a bar fight. While in the big house he is paired in his cell with Hunk Houghton Mickey Shaughnessy an ageing country singer whose best days are behind him. The pair strike up a friendship and Houghton teaches Everett to play the guitar however it's apparent that Everett is all about the voice. Reckognising this fact Houghton is quick to strike up a contract with Everett so that once both are on the outside they can make some money in the music industry. Paroled well early into his stretch Everett meets Peggy Van Alden Judy Tyler a record company talent scout who eventually gets won around by Everett and they record a song. Although there are initial problems with the industry the song takes off after the pair set up their own record company. But with fame comes internal conflict and Houghton is now released and wanting to call in on his and Everett's prison contract.Chances are that if you asked a group of film lovers to name an Elvis Presley motion picture the majority would say Jailhouse Rock. Now that's not to say that is because it's the best film from The King because that would be King Creole or Flaming Star. Or that it's the most fun film of the 31 pictures he made because that would be Viva Las Vegas. Its standing probably has more to do with the title song than the actual film itself. Which is actually a shame because although Jailhouse Rock is a weak film in many ways it's also a film where Preseley got to play a moody rebel like character. The like of which we would not see again. This was Presley's third feature length film and the first for MGM. Shot in black  white by Robert J. Bronner it's directed by Richard Thorpe and penned by Guy Trosper out of a story by Nedrick Young.The problems exist within the weak plot that has holes the size of Leavenworth Prison. Characters come and go without any purpose or meaning and Thorp uses shortcuts to keep the film's running time as trim as Presley's waist line was here. Yet to me these are forgivable issues as Presley embraces his rebel with a heart and gives it the full tilt lip snarling treatment. His Vince Everett is the guy that girls want to bed lots of Elvis bare torso here girls and the guy that guys want to be. And of course there is also a great set of songs and the choreography to lap up at every other turn. Along with the famous and quite brilliant title song we also get Treat Me Nice Baby I Don't Care I Want To Be Free Don't Leave Me Now and the sublimely tender Young  Beautiful. The latter of which stops this particular viewer in his tracks and instills a warmth that normally only Judy Garland gives me when warbling over the rainbow. Yes I love this film in spite of its obvious failings.The sad footnote to the film concerns costar Judy Tyler who along with her then husband Greg Lafayette was killed in an automobile accident a couple of weeks after filming had finished. Thus never even getting to see the film released. Elvis was shattered and is said to have never watched the film as it would have been too painful. So as Elvis sings Young  Beautiful it becomes one feels a fitting tribute to a young actress cut down in her prime. In 2007 a Deluxe edition of the film was released on DVD remastered in sound and picture it's a triumphant release that really does the film justice. For now Elvis Judy and those wonderful songs have never looked or sounded so great as they do now. 810".

On that note this is one of Presley's most interesting acting performances I've seen him in yet having been used to his more goodygoody for the family parts during much of the '60s. Tyler and Shaughnessy are also good for their parts as they provide plenty for the King to chew on. All the musical numbers especially the title number are spot on. Highly recommended for Elvis fans.

Everett is one of my favourite characters ever in movies the only one I could picture playing him instead of Elvis would possibly have been James Dean that is if he could sing and had lived a little longer. This is Elvis Presley's best acting performance his Danny Fisher in King Creole a close second and it's because of Elvis that this movie gains any credibility. When Vince is in jail after having accidentally killed a man in a bar fight he learns to pick a guitar and discovers he has an excellent singing voice.  Encouraged by a fellow inmate he performs in front of an audience and is well accepted.  Upon his release from prison he makes a deal with his inmate to split his profit should he make it big on the outside with him 5050. He does make it big and in the meantime treats everybody who helped get him there like dirt even the inmate when he is finally released. While this movie cuts a lot of corners and isn't always all that believable you're still in awe of Presley's performance as the angry and incredibly selfish and self loving s.o.b.  If Elvis hadn't been a good actor he would never have pulled this role of as well as he did. All in all a very good film sappy ending though and a terrific Elvis soundtrack.  What's not to like? 8 out of 10.".

So I finally gave Jailhouse Rock a viewing considering it's a nice young Elvis and this is supposed to be his best or one of his best of his 30 movies.Well truthfully if JR is among his best films I'd really hate to see the worst! Elvis himself was fine but the movie itself was just kind of weak. It was surprising to see The Elvis character act the way he does  in pretty much the whole film he's something of a jerk and not really too likable. That's why it is odd to see him do things like defend the tramp in the bar and take a stand against crookedness in the music business against the way he acts in other parts of the movie because really Elvis' character is a jerk. But he looks good and sings well and that's what the fans wanna see and Elvis definitely delivers the goods there. The girls are pretty and it is funny to see Elvis getting into fights and threatening people. All in all watching a corny old Elvis movie like this is not a bad way to spend 90 movieviewing minutes although you aren't going to sit through it again unless you are a huge Elvis fan. Thank you very much!".

The songs are spectacular and the plot is magnificent. The dance sequence is revolutionary and it is remarkable that it was Elvis himself who choreographed it thus showing his truly wonderful talent. I thought that the chemistry between Elvis and Judy Tyler was definitely there and you could tell that they enjoyed being in each other's company. This makes it all the more tragic that she was to die just days after shooting the film was complete and a shocking car accident I believe on the way back from her honeymoon. She was clearly on her way to being one of the most aweinspiring actresses and a person whom Elvis clearly had a liking to. He apparently was so saddened by her death that he never watched the film again. I would recommend this film to anybody and everybody regardless whether they are Elvis fans like myself! or not. Elvis clearly enjoys making this film and it is a real opportunity to see what a terrific actor he would have become with good future productions. A brilliant film watch it!".

So when what is supposed to be his best film Jailhouse Rock came on TV I decided to give it a look.The film had a lot of good and a lot of bad....but mostly bad. On the positive side the songs are great and when Elvis is singing the film is at its best. Unfortunately while folks back then might have enjoyed the plot I thought it was dreadful. Instead of making Elvis likable the guy he plays in Jailhouse Rock is brooding rude and a real hothead. Much of the time he's inexplicably angry at the world yet the character wonders why the girl doesn't like him! If I didn't know better I'd have sworn that Elvis' character was supposed to be suffering throughout the film with a very bad case of PMS!The bottom line is that the writing was the problem with this film. Whether or not Elvis was a good or bad actor is something the movie simply doesn't address as no musician could come off very well based on the lousy dialog and character he's given in this one.".

The man had been accosting a young woman in the bar and Elvis didn't like it and punched him which led to the brawl. Anyway Elvis ends up being convicted of manslaughter and is sentenced to 110 years in jail. While in jail he meets Mickey Shaughnessy a hasbeen country singer who seems to have been in the clink for a while. Shaughnessy hears Elvis sing and promises to teach him how to play the guitar. He later convinces Elvis to perform in an upcoming inmate variety show which is also televised. After the appearance Elvis receives gobs of fan letters. Jealous Shaughnessy arranges to make sure Elvis doesn't receive his fan letters. He then convinces Elvis to sign a contract promising to cut him in for 50 of the profits if Elvis becomes a star.After almost two years Elvis is released from jail he gets a job at a nightclub where he meets a beautiful young woman Judy Tyler. Tyler's story is tragic. Just days after completing production on this film her first big role she and her husband were killed in a gruesome car accident. She was only 24. I really liked her in this film. She also had a beautiful speaking voice. I think she would have made something of herself in the movie business had fate not intervened. Anyway after hearing Elvis sing onstage during an impromptu performance she convinces him to record a demo for a local record studio. Elvis' song ends up being stolen by another artist and he and Tyler form their own record label to produce his music. Elvis' career takes off and so does his ego.Elvis' character seems to be a bit quick tempered as he hits people frequently throughout the film. I thought that Tyler's character somewhat evened out Elvis' character. If he had a tendency toward being impulsive she was more level headed and rational. Shaughnessy's character was also interesting as he was a bit of a sleaze but you also felt bad for him as well.The songs in the film were good too my favorite though being Jailhouse Rock which is part of a prisonthemed performance planned for the television special that Elvis is to appear in and shows Elvis in all of his glory.Certainly less formulaic than the 60's Elvis films I really enjoyed this one.".

He embarked on a film career consisting of 33 films from 1956 to 1969 films that did well at the boxoffice but mostly panned critically especially his later films and while he was a highly charismatic performer he was never considered a great actor.Personally am of the opinion that some of his early stuff is actually pretty good a few even more so than that the writing and stories weren't always a strong suit but they had good supporting performances great soundtracks with some iconic songs they didn't look like they were made on the cheap and Elvis actually showed himself to be a decent enough actor when the songs and material allowed it. The later films when Elvis was past prime not only had those story and script problems but did have problems with production values less good supporting cast and Elvis being past prime and didn't even have the benefit of having good soundtracks.'Jailhouse Rock' is often considered Elvis' best film a consensus agreed with by me. It may not be a masterpiece of film and it's not perfect but for an Elvis film it's very good proving that not every Elvis film is deserving of scorn regardless of initial reputations though actually for an Elvis film mixed reviews shows that it was still better received than most of them. The dialogue once again is not a strength in 'Jailhouse Rock' too many times making one cringe in its corniness and soapiness. A few of the situations are a touch on the hackneyed side too.However 'Jailhouse Rock' is well shot and is hardly a film that while not looking expensive not looking cheap. Richard Thorpe always struck me as a very capable director but tended to be somewhat of an undistinguished one he does well here and does nothing to undermine Elvis' star power or the emotional impact of the story.The soundtrack is magnificent and one of the best for an Elvis film while the iconic title song have always had great fun singing and dancing along to this song is stunningly choreographed and iconic for good reason making just as big an impact are a tender Young and Beautiful and a soulblistering and bloodstirring Baby I Don't Care.While the story is unexceptional structurally it is one of the better stories in an Elvis film it is unusually dark and very moving often with a personal edge that makes it even sadder to watch. Elvis' performance here is one of his most natural very little stiffness here and while he is not in the same ballpark as his influences Marlon Brando and James Dean this is the closest he ever came in his film career to be as good as Dean he's charming tormented charismatic in an easygoing sense and there is once again like in his previous two films a genuine emotional honesty. He sings sublimely and distinctively.Judy Tyler is endearing tragic what happened to hear and Mickey Shaughnessy excels in a serious role.Overall a very strong contender for Elvis' best gets my personal vote for that distinction and Elvis himself rocks it. 810 Bethany Cox".

Middle aged Humbert a European arrives in the United States where he has secured at job at Beardsley College in Beardsley Ohio as a Professor of French Literature. Before he begins his post in the fall he decides to spend the summer in the resort town of Ramsdale New Hampshire. He is given the name of Charlotte Haze as someone who is renting a room in her home for the summer. He finds that Charlotte widowed now for seven years is a woman who puts on airs. Among the demonstration of those airs is throwing around the name of Clare Quilty a television and stage script writer who came to speak at her women's club meeting and who she implies is now a friend. Those airs also mask being lonely especially as she is a sexually aggressive and liberated woman. Humbert considers Charlotte a proverbial joke but ...";

Nabokov adapts his own infamous novel for the screen and Kubrick no less translates it into images in a way that makes it unique unforgettable and transcendental without ever putting himself in front of the camera. A Kubrick film can't be recognized by its style. Kubrick never made two films alike but there is something that unquestionable makes them stand out. In Lolita's case the mere idea of touching the controversial novel with its taboo subject at its very core seem like a provocation from the word go. Pornography for the thinking man in which the only explicit act is the intention written in the character's eyes. Nothing is excessive and nothing is pulled back. James Mason  villain or victim  is monumental monumental! The unspeakable truth never leaves his brow. He is the most civilized man trapped in the lowest echelon of his own psyche. So aware that it is painful to watch. Shelley Winters goes for it taking her Mrs Hayes for all its worth and dives into the void of a desperate housewife craving for sex. It is one of the most entertaining shattering human spectacles I've ever seen. But unlike Mason she's not aware of it. There is a horrible innocence attached to her sickness. Peter Sellers's character from hell the torturer comes in three riveting characterizations and Sue Lyon's temptress the child is the devil incarnate in a performance that defies description. None of them were nominated for Oscars and the film was condemned by every moral group in America and beyond. As film experiences go this is one of the most provocative enthralling disgusting entertaining and satisfying I've ever been through. Yep I really mean that.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film remains my alltime favorite. It's a delicious adult meditation on youth obsession and sex. While not entirely faithful to the novel it captures the book's spirit and is nonetheless a masterpiece on its own terms. To fully appreciate what Kubrick has done compare this version to Adrian Lyne's anemic remake. Kubrick chose his cast wisely for the most part. James Mason conveys both the tormented inner soul and the outwardly polite gentleman with such charm that you simply can't despise him for his treachery. Shelley Winters was never better as the shrill manhungry shrew. Sue Lyon is enormously credible in a complex role  physically attractive childish at times in her behavior but quietly calculating and manipulative. The weakest link is Peter Sellers who Kubrick found amusing enough to let him run on too long. Sellers was a brilliant performer but just not right for this film. As Quilty he's fine. When masquerading as others he's mostly intrusive and tends to alter the tone of what's going on. The need to tread carefully around the censors in 1962 actually works in the film's favor. There's a sophisticated subtlety that counterbalances the lurid subject matter. In fact I even prefer the editedfortelevision version of the scene in which Humbert and Lolita first have sex. Here she merely whispers in his ear before a suggestive fadeout. In the complete version of the film the scene continues with them discussing a silly game played at summer camp. The less said the better.Lolita has aged remarkably well. Its topic is relevant today and the careful craftsmanship that went into this production holds up beautifully. I think it's Kubrick's best film  they tended to get more selfindulgent as time went on. This one's a gem. Not to be overlooked are the aptly provocative title sequence and Nelson Riddle's luscious piano score.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen both versions of Lolita now. The 1997 version directed by Adrian Lyne certainly has it's merits and is headed by two very good leads in Irons and Swain. But it is this Stanley Kubrick's adaptation that I prefer overall. Kubrick said in an interview after the film's release Had I known what I would've had to cut out I probably wouldn't of made the film. It's a surprising irony though that what had to be suppressed or changed from the book works to his advantage. Like other works under the master's belt this has some comedy that is so dark that you almost or do feel guilty after laughing. The innuendo even decades later is still as provocative. And when it gets disturbing it doesn't go too far over the line. I have not read the book but I have heard much about it what was different and I think Kubrick at least is most successful at infusing his trademark touches to the material.For starters there is the acting. Like with for example Full Metal Jacket the supporting actors somehow outrank the leads. This is not to say that James Mason Humbert Humbert and Sue Lyon Dolores Lolita Hayes are not highly believable in their parts. But in looking at Peter Sellers in his multiple roles via the curious insanely oddball Quilty and Shelley Winters as Lolita's mother they are simply flatout brilliant I would choose a better word if I could believe me. Right from the first scene which happens to take the last scene of the story in place Sellers doesn't have me for a second thinking that he isn't perfectly offthewall. As was in Dr. Strangelove his contributions to the project are incalculable. Winters on the other hand finds that balance with Mrs. Hayes as a lonely middleaged woman looking for companionship though unable to shake her overprotective tendencies.As for Mason and Lyon their scenes together are at the least a little overtly melodramatic which might have been the idea it may take another few viewings to really grasp the weight of their performances and at best helps define what the film is about. Mason finds the right notes if a little anxiously and stuffy at times in how Humbert is almost like a kid trying to break out of his middleaged professor image. When he meets Lolita he's awestruck and falls for her hard very hard which sets up what happens to the two of them for the rest of the film. What is even more interesting is how the dynamic is placed with Lolita who is wiser in ways Humbert is not and how the sort of idea of mutual youth is tempting but definitely not everlasting. As the film unfolds it's third act the film becomes an intense kind of morality tale where male insecurities are touched upon with Humbert and even Quilty to a degree. Kubrick being one of the finest of dramatic character psychologists hardly skips a beat in making sure not to lose the strange bits which must be some of the better bits in Nabokov's text with humor.Then there is the most rewarding thing of all in a Kubrick film which is seeing how he photographs the scenes and characters. It holds some of the moves and angles and lighting he's held to for all of his career some shots show as a precursor to Eyes Wide Shut perhaps and how the camera stays on the characters in many scenes actually almost all the scenes adds that right tension and space between us and them. If anything else just watch the film for the sake of watching a film moving and staying put and capturing faces in particular ways. Lolita in the end may not be one of my very favorite Kubrick films though only time and repeat viewings will tell but it's certainly worth a viewing. Some Kubrick fans may come to this after seeing the essentials like 2001 the Shining or Clockwork Orange however it could come as being a favorite in some circles. It certainly is for my money as enticing and intriguing a sexual satire I've seen in many a moon.".

	schema:headline " One of the finest films of The Sixties";
	schema:reviewBody "810Kubrik's version of Nabokov's tale of a middleaged professor's selfdestructive obsession with a young schoolgirl. Making a film that dealt with underage sex was considered impossible in 1962 due to the strict censorship regulations. Kubrik manages to get round this by merely alluding to sexual encounters and subtle wordplay and symbolism creeps into several scenes. He also raises the girl's age from 12 in the novel to 14 in the film. Lolita is also rich in Kubrik's trademark dark humour.The three central characters of the novel are all portrayed more than adequately in the film James Mason as the smitten professor Shelley Winters as the suburban widow with pretensions of culture and Sue Lyons as the young nymphet. However it is Sellars' performance as the creepy eccentric Clare Quilty a relatively minor character in the book that steals the show and ultimately makes the film. The opening scene which is the ending of the film is an outstanding testament to his talent and versatility. The said scene gives the film the same circular structure used by David Lean in Brief Encounter.My favourite moments include Quilty's reintroduction to the film at the school's summer ball as the camera pans across the dancefloor and subtly reveals a look of comic ambivalence on his face as he dances with his lover Humbert awkwardly trying to book the only remaining hotelroom at the police convention and Humbert again trying to teach the cynical Lolita the joys of Edgar Allen Poe's poetry.I thoroughly recommend this film.

	onyx:emotionText "810Kubrik's version of Nabokov's tale of a middleaged professor's selfdestructive obsession with a young schoolgirl. Making a film that dealt with underage sex was considered impossible in 1962 due to the strict censorship regulations. Kubrik manages to get round this by merely alluding to sexual encounters and subtle wordplay and symbolism creeps into several scenes. He also raises the girl's age from 12 in the novel to 14 in the film. Lolita is also rich in Kubrik's trademark dark humour.The three central characters of the novel are all portrayed more than adequately in the film James Mason as the smitten professor Shelley Winters as the suburban widow with pretensions of culture and Sue Lyons as the young nymphet. However it is Sellars' performance as the creepy eccentric Clare Quilty a relatively minor character in the book that steals the show and ultimately makes the film. The opening scene which is the ending of the film is an outstanding testament to his talent and versatility. The said scene gives the film the same circular structure used by David Lean in Brief Encounter.My favourite moments include Quilty's reintroduction to the film at the school's summer ball as the camera pans across the dancefloor and subtly reveals a look of comic ambivalence on his face as he dances with his lover Humbert awkwardly trying to book the only remaining hotelroom at the police convention and Humbert again trying to teach the cynical Lolita the joys of Edgar Allen Poe's poetry.I thoroughly recommend this film. My only complaint is the length  the final third seemed to drag a bit.";

As Lolita Sue Lyon is convincing although Kubrick makes her character a bit older probably to satisfy the censors which still slapped this with an X rating originally much to my surprise.  The movie could play on TV today with no edits.  I have not seen the 1997 remake but can only imagine given its director with a reputation of going over the top that it's not as classy and tasteful as this one.  Since this was made in 1962 the risque elements from the book were left to our imagination.  And the movie scores highly because of it. The movie's story is stuck in the '60s that bubblegum music which played during Lolita's early scenes will stick with you and if you are bored with the story or cannot believe what you're seeing you can always get a culture lesson  Hula hoops malt shops pseudo intellectuals faulty cots and gas stations where they still pump your gas.".

The kid is a loss but since we couldn't have a twelveyear old who seduces several the role is placeholder only. The whole revolves around us believing that Sellers is a sort of god in the machine. This is a noble experiment which almost works. Sellers introduces himself as Spartacus from behind the curtain. Then we see how he has manipulated the last several years. He is turned into a filmmaker to enhance the selfreference who entices poor Loli into making a film presumably this one.I think it may be a long time before viewers can fully appreciate Kubrick's experiments in shifting the story to the vision by clever narrative folds.

This is surely true.  And I might add if you want to acquaint yourself with Nabokov's Lolita' without actually reading it  to hell with you.  You don't stand a chance anyway.  Humbert's narration cannot possibly make it to the screen in one piece.  Kubrick at least made no attempt.  He even invents his own material which Lyne is afraid or unwilling to do.Something about Lyne's authenticity is even shocking.  He opens the story in 1947 which is when the story in fact opens  yet everything looks jarringly oldfashioned whereas Kubrick's indeterminate 1950s setting looks right. The bulk of the story might as well take place in the 1950s as any other time.  The crucial point is that the story cannot begin any EARLIER than 1947  we need a postwar America with motels dotting the landscape. Humbert has little contact with contemporary culture he only encounters the snippets of music and film that obsess Lolita and he finds them unendurably vulgar.  Kubrick captures this very well.  There's this boppy little pop tune we never hear the end of  although most of the time we only hear it subliminally  for the first half of the movie and it sounds like exactly the kind of tune that drove Humbert up the wall.Kubrick's cast is a strong one.  It's crowned by Peter Sellers as Quilty  and before you complain that we see too much of him ask yourself what scene featuring Quilty could you possibly want to be removed?  Admittedly since this is 1962 we have a Lolita who is merely sixteen  but maybe this isn't just because it's 1962.  After all the book does two things at once.  It makes us understand perfectly why Humbert is attracted to Lolita  we see her through his eyes  while constantly reminding us that Lolita is not someone that we would be attracted to ourselves.  Both are worthy goals but when it comes time to film the book the director must make a choice between them.  Kubrick picked a genuinely attractive but still obviously young Sue Lyon.  I can't fault this choice.  As for Humbert  well here Kubrick was actually MORE daring than Lyne was.  Humbert Humbert is a sympathetic character who is also calculating manipulative and  now and then  shockingly brutal.  James Mason allows Humbert to be all of these things.  This doesn't prevent him from being sympathetic.  The story takes care of that.It comes down to this.  What exactly does Humbert do that's so wrong?  Is it that he has sex with a minor?  Considered in itself this is the least of his crimes.  What's really wrong is the way he attempts to be Lolita's lover and guardian simultaneously and of course he makes a hash of both jobs. THAT is what's essential to the story of Lolita and that's what Kubrick transfers to the screen at least as well as Lyne.Having said that I must add that both versions are very good.  They're also different enough to scarcely even be competitors.  See them one after the other if you like.".

Overall I was impressed by what he had done but I felt some parts of the film didn't quite work. Firstly although i think Sellers is a great actor and I love him in everything I've seen him in I just couldn't get comfortable with his role here. When reading the book I had a totally different vision of Quilty so I found it hard to readjust to Seller's performance. Although his acting is great and hilarious as always it just didn't fit into the plot for me. I thought James Mason was good and he played the gradual disintegration of Humbert Humbert with an intensity which i enjoyed. However i felt that the film did not reveal as much of his character as the novel portrays. The name Humbert Humbert suggests two sides to his nature and I felt that too much emphasis was placed on his suave and intelligent side and not enough time was devoted to his burning desire and passion for Lolita. I particularly missed one of my favourite lines that was not used in film 'Lolita light of my life fire of my loins. My sin my soul.' Although i haven't seen the film in a long time I think Jeremy Irons from the 1997 version is a much better actor for the role.Sue Lyon made a great Lolita although she did tremble on the line between looking young enough for the role and looking too old for it. Still there were times in the film where she looked so young the odious nature of Humbert's act really struck me. Speaking of this I felt the film skipped past too much of what really went on between Humbert and Lolita. Although Nabokov similarly leaves this to the reader's imagination I thought a little more could have been done to stress the nature of Humbert and Lolita's relationship.Shelley Winters was brilliant and her acting added so much to the character of Charlotte Haze. I thought she was wonderful she really fleshed the character out.Overall I did enjoy watching this film despite the small niggles I had with it but I view it as something separate to the novel. In this way it's a more enjoyable experience. I'm looking forward to seeing the 1997 version of the film again I saw it once years ago! as I think it is a movie that will benefit much more having been made in a time of a more permissive society allowing more creative freedom in what can be shown.".

	schema:headline " How DID They Make A Film Out of 'Lolita'?";
	schema:reviewBody "Lolita has been one of my favorite novels for quite some time. Ive always felt that it was one of Nabokov's best and that the portrayal of Humbert and Lolita's affair was truly touching. I put off seeing the movies for quite some time because I knew that they probably wouldn't live up to my expectations. However I finally gave in and rented Kubrick's version. I went into the film with an open mind and came out dissapointed.The film has alot of problemssurprisingly many of them can be traced to it's script which was written by Nabokov himself. Perhaps he should have stuck to writing novels. The main problem was characterization. We are flung into the plot of the story immediately with almost no background given to Humbert Humbert. In the book nearly 50 pages lead up to his meeting Lolita describing his pedophilic tendencies his previous sex life and attempts to stifle his true preferences. In general we come to sympathize with the monster that is H.H. However in the film we are given no time to get to know Humbert Humbert. He is a flat character. I think the actor had little to work with although his choice of accent for a primarily French man was unusual and annoying. Moreover in the book the storty is told from the POV of H.H. allowing us to understand his obsession. In the movie its told from an impartial outside silent narrator. This is a huge problem.Before I continue I should note that a problem that was not the filmmaker's fault was the censors. The film is about a novel about pedophilia. There isnt any point in making the movie if you cant make the movie about pedophilia. The censors dont allow even a mention of H.H. and Lolita's love affair its very strange. Had I not read the book it would take me probably nearly half the movie to figure out even the inklings of their growing affections for eachother. Its ridiculous to try and make a movie about a subject that you cant...make a movie about! The tagline says it all How did they make a movie out of Lolita? I dont know they barely did.One of the worst things the censors did was make Lolita 14 rather than 12 as she is in the book. Her fragile childlike nature in the novle is transformed into a ridiculous teenage whininess. The character of Lolita is barely recognizable. In the book Lolita is barely entering puberty. She is cheeky and affectionate. She never truly seduces Humbert Humbert and maintains a childlike innocence throughout the beginning of the novel. The most heartbreaking part of the story is how her innocence is slowly destroyed by H.H. despite his best intentions. In the movie Lolita is manipulative seductive annoying obnoxious and OLD. She is not the innocent child in the book. Her and HH's relationship is mostly them quarreling. It gets annoying.Overall the movie was a decent attempt at a film and a terrible attempt at an adaptation of Nabokov's brilliant novel.".

	onyx:emotionText "Lolita has been one of my favorite novels for quite some time. Ive always felt that it was one of Nabokov's best and that the portrayal of Humbert and Lolita's affair was truly touching. I put off seeing the movies for quite some time because I knew that they probably wouldn't live up to my expectations. However I finally gave in and rented Kubrick's version. I went into the film with an open mind and came out dissapointed.The film has alot of problemssurprisingly many of them can be traced to it's script which was written by Nabokov himself. Perhaps he should have stuck to writing novels. The main problem was characterization. We are flung into the plot of the story immediately with almost no background given to Humbert Humbert. In the book nearly 50 pages lead up to his meeting Lolita describing his pedophilic tendencies his previous sex life and attempts to stifle his true preferences. In general we come to sympathize with the monster that is H.H. However in the film we are given no time to get to know Humbert Humbert. He is a flat character. I think the actor had little to work with although his choice of accent for a primarily French man was unusual and annoying. Moreover in the book the storty is told from the POV of H.H. allowing us to understand his obsession. In the movie its told from an impartial outside silent narrator. This is a huge problem.Before I continue I should note that a problem that was not the filmmaker's fault was the censors. The film is about a novel about pedophilia.

	schema:reviewBody "While performances in this film were very good especially Shelly Winters I was disappointed over all. I don't think a film should necessarily be exactly like the book because celluloid and text are different media producing different effects in the audience. However the differences in this film that mattered were I think down to direction. What didn't come across in the film was the emotional and moral ambiguity of the story and the film failed the story in this respect especially in Lolita's final scene as Mrs. Richard Schiller. Reading the book I was impressed with the way Nabokov portrayed Lolita here as a little more grown up but more fragile than before ie. less defensive and so practical. It really underscored Humbert's unconscious intimations of her unhappiness during their time together and that her vulgarity was a cover for her emotional fragility. Her final scene in the movie presents her as the same scheming Lolita and fails to convey the tenuousness of her situation in what she is asking of him.Secondly I was disappointed with the casting of James Mason who although a fine actor was too old for the part. Humbert in the novel was 37 or 38 and I think this is an important factor again in the ambiguity of the story this is not some middle aged lecher past his prime. Humbert is at the height of his attractiveness and is a charming man who has virtually everyone fooledbut for Clare Quilty and this is because he is 'like' Humbert in a sense even his alterego the 'happier' or less conscience burdened face of pedophilia.Thirdly the scene with the psychologist was not Quilty in the book but a middle aged and very serious woman and I think that substitution played an important role in distorting the essence of the story. In the book this scene serves to impress upon the reader the impact of Humbert's dalliance with her upon her psychosexual development that she was in fact regressing in her development and retreating into a sexually latent stage rather than one of sexual awakening. That there were signs like this told a lot about her situation that as Humbert himself admits he had broken her but also heightens the sense of danger that people are starting to sense something's not quite right about them. The substitution of Quilty into this role on the other hand and especially in the form of farce detracts from this depth and makes Lolita seem more calculating and informed than she perhaps was. This again is enforced in the direction of her final scene where she recounts Quilty's role in a way that humiliates Humbert.All in all the film makes Lolita look far more like a 'player' than she was and in this sense reinforces Humbert's interpretation of her without undercutting his perspective with unconscious slips in the clever way that Nabokov had achieved in the novel. I haven't seen the more recent version with Jeromy Irons but I have a sense that it has made more of an effort to deal with the moralemotional ambiguity of the story than Kubrick's version did.".

	schema:reviewBody "Considering how brilliant 2001 A Space Odyssey and Barry Lyndon were it's kind of hard to imagine Stanley Kubrick making a bad film. Unfortunately throughout his prolific career he did make a couple of clunkers and Lolita is definitely one of them.The comedy was misplaced and unfunny the creepiness was corny and uncreepy and the overall mood was as dry as sandpaper. The deepest and the most artistic scene in the entire film was the introduction. Aside from that barely anything was impressive or accessible enough to draw me in. For most of the 2 12 hours I watched each scene lumber by and barely cared for what I was seeing.Why was Clare Quilty such a front and center character? Was it because Peter Sellers agreed to play the part and they wanted to see as much of him as possible? Is that why they chose to overdevelop his character give him more lines than anyone have him play two characters and stray completely from the poetic chords that made the book so moving? And why was Humbert Humbert's background so underexplained? If you had never read the book the deeper reasons behind his sickness and everything else would be mostly unknown.The story and the character development jumped about with hardly any subtly. For example Humbert out of the clear blue begins to rant about his controlling wife and a few moments later he contemplates on ways to kill her with a gun. There were no hints about him having murderous tendencies within the story's chronology but all of a sudden he does? And there is no sexual tension or chemistry between Humbert and Lolita you can barely tell that they have a relationship at all. Maybe the 1960s censors are to blame for this. Nevertheless the relationship still feels very shallow unbelievable and unjustified. Why would a beautiful young girl want to have sex with a man who was as old and as ugly as James Mason? This is never explained.As a longtime Kubrick fan I'm not afraid to say that this film downright sucked. I only give it a 5 out of 10 because it wasn't entirely awful. There were moments when Kubrick's trademark directing and cinematography sparkled through but overall I was extremely disappointed.".

Sue Lyon played the coy Lolita so well but when you read her biography and see that she had a series of short failed marriages after this film was made you have to wonder if her performance was so good because she was playing a character not far from herself. But the real star is Peter Sellers playing Clare Quilty. Overall a fine movie depicting how unreasonable and blind obsession can cloud the thinking of otherwise reasonable and educated people. Here it was a man but we certainly have not cornered that fault.After viewing this movie I read Nabakov's book. It is much more revealing no surprise there as to how Humbert made an elaborate justification in his mind that is was OK for a man in his late 30s to have a sexual relationship with a girl in the 10 to 14 year old range finally having one with Lo when she was 12. It of course is much more explicit in describing their passion and activities. Now I too am a bit surprised that the book was ever made into a movie.".

	schema:headline " Kurbrick's Underrated Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "Kurbrick was one of the greatest film makers of all time. His attention to detail and his meticulous style is rarely seen in films today. It was rarely seen in his day too. The down side of his perfectionist nature thought was that he didn't make many films. Still he did make a few classics in his day. Films like A Clockwork Orange 2001 Paths of Glory Dr. Strangelove and The Shinning. One film that often gets overlooked though is Lolita.This film is different. The tagline is How Did they Ever Make a Movie Out of Lolita. The plot is this Prof. Humbert Humbert comes to America rents a house meets the landlady's young nymphet daughter falls instantly in love and purses her rather relentlessly. So yes the plot of this story is rather unconventional. Kubrick has gone on record saying that if he knew the kind of limitations there would be that he wouldn't have even bothered making the movie. Basically with the censors of the day the relationship between Humbert and Lolita couldn't be shown or talked about in any real way. Now this movie came out in 1962 and to keep things in context you should remember that in the 1950's married couples on TV and movies were shown sleeping in separate beds at night. So the idea of showing a man in his 50's sleeping with a young girl the actress who played Lolita Sue Lyon was only 14 at the time was pretty much out of the question. And while some might see this as a major problem it really isn't. The relationship while never out right admitted is alluded to a lot. They say it without actually saying it.The real strength of this movie though is the actors. James Mason plays Humbert perfectly. His character oozes aristocratic disdain and disgust for everything around him. Especially Shelly Winters that's the landlady. That is until he sees Lolita. Once he sets his eyes on her that's it. While his intentions are a little repulsive he pursues them with such a dogged genuine determination you do sympathize with him a bit.And Sue Lyon was absolutely perfect as Lolita. The way she carries herself the way she talks the way she teases Humbert. On the one hand it seems like she knows exactly what she is doing. She knows the effect she has on him and she seems to love toying with him. Although on the other hand she might just be a teenager fooling around. With her character it is very hard to tell. One scene she seems wise beyond on her age and in the next she is carrying on like petulant child.And of course we have Shelly Winters one of the most underrated actress of all time. And yes her character Lolita's mother is very shrill and annoying. That was kind of Shelly Winters bread and butter but she was supposed to be shrill an annoying. An obstacle for Humbert to get past. Still Shelly Winters brought such a wounded vulnerability to her character. This is a woman who lost her husband is not very bright and her new tenant Humbert is uh kind of problematic. There is one scene where she breaks down and it is truly heartbreaking.This film is also filled with Kubrick's usual cinematic flair. There are so many little things hidden in the visuals that you don't notice at first but make the film much richer on repeat viewings.This film is not without its flaws however. It does drag a bit in the middle. And there is way way to much of Peter Sellers. Kubrick was such a meticulous director with his shot and his sets and especially his actors. But for whatever reason he gave Sellers way to much leeway. Now this did work in Dr. Strangelove where Sellers had to play all these different characters but here where he just plays the character Clare Quilty all these different voices and mannerisms he keeps using it's just distracting. And a little annoying. Kurbrick definitely should have rained Sellers in.Besides those few flaws this film is truly a classic. It deserves to be ranked right alongside all of Kubrick's other classic films. It's the kind of film where one scene your laughing the next scene your skin is crawling.That's the power of Lolita".

She knows the effect she has on him and she seems to love toying with him. Although on the other hand she might just be a teenager fooling around. With her character it is very hard to tell. One scene she seems wise beyond on her age and in the next she is carrying on like petulant child.And of course we have Shelly Winters one of the most underrated actress of all time. And yes her character Lolita's mother is very shrill and annoying. That was kind of Shelly Winters bread and butter but she was supposed to be shrill an annoying. An obstacle for Humbert to get past. Still Shelly Winters brought such a wounded vulnerability to her character. This is a woman who lost her husband is not very bright and her new tenant Humbert is uh kind of problematic. There is one scene where she breaks down and it is truly heartbreaking.This film is also filled with Kubrick's usual cinematic flair. There are so many little things hidden in the visuals that you don't notice at first but make the film much richer on repeat viewings.This film is not without its flaws however. It does drag a bit in the middle. And there is way way to much of Peter Sellers. Kubrick was such a meticulous director with his shot and his sets and especially his actors. But for whatever reason he gave Sellers way to much leeway. Now this did work in Dr. Strangelove where Sellers had to play all these different characters but here where he just plays the character Clare Quilty all these different voices and mannerisms he keeps using it's just distracting. And a little annoying. Kurbrick definitely should have rained Sellers in.Besides those few flaws this film is truly a classic. It deserves to be ranked right alongside all of Kubrick's other classic films. It's the kind of film where one scene your laughing the next scene your skin is crawling.That's the power of Lolita";

	schema:reviewBody "What a controversial film this little flick called 'Lolita' was back in it's day. It's day was 1962 and during that time there wasn't a lot of lenience in the MPAA. Researching about this film I found they were threatening to give it an 'X' rating if they showed any sexuality or expressions of sexuality between the middleaged Humbert Humbert and the breathtakingly beautiful young teenager Lolita. This would be absurd by today's standards the film would be able to earn a 'PG13' at the worst if it was released today. The movie was deemed so inappropriate and obscene that little Sue Lyons who played Lolita wasn't allowed into the movie premiere of 'Lolita' because she was under age. Now that's a load of crap even for the 1962 era standards. Audiences were just so much more uptight back then and we may have been like that today if it wasn 't for the brave souls to spoke and acted against this like Stanley Kubrick when he made the film idea of 'Lolita' into a reality.'Lolita' based on the risqu love story novel by Vladimir Nobokov who also provided the film's screenplay follows a middleaged novelist Humbert Humbert the late great James Mason who is looking for a place to rent out for a couple months while he begins writing his new novel. He eventually finds a place a house with a room up for rent. The house belongs to Charlotte Haze Shelly Winters a middleaged widow who has an eye for Humbert but that's the problem. Charlotte has a 14yearold daughter who Humbert becomes immediately madly in lust with. Humbert eventually marries Charlotte only to get close to Lolita so he can have his way with her. Charlotte is oblivious to this and Humbert and Lolita start up a relationship nonsexual and Humbert realizes he becomes in love with her and not just in lust with her. Humbert thinks he's got everything figured out how to be with her but he has some competition with Charlotte's exboyfriend a famous television game show host Clare Quilty the late and especially great Peter Sellers whose also madly in lust with young innocent well seemingly innocent Lolita.'Lolita' is a great film but it's not one of the genius Mr. Stanley Kubrick's best films. The acting is sensational in 'Lolita' with extraordinary performances all around. James Mason is marvelous in the lead role as the conflicted Humbert Humbert. Mason perhaps provides one of the most powerful and hard to play roles in his career. Numerous Oscar winner Shelly Winters is undeniably brilliant as Charlotte Haze she really does a lot with her role and she stands out in the scenes she's in. It's a damn shame she didn't even get an Academy Award Nominee for this. Sue Lyon does a pretty good job as Lolita and after this I'm not sure she did much else. The real standout of the film is of course Peter Sellers. You know he was just so perfect for the role of the sexhungry weasel that is Clare Quilty. Instead of playing the tricky pedophile with creepiness and anger like most people would he riskily plays it funny and with a sense of likableness that only an actor with such exquisite finesse and genius like Peter Sellers could do. Peter Sellers was one of his time's greatest actors and he really steals every scene he is featured in in Kubrick's 'Lolita'. Vladimir Nobokov's screenplay is wonderfully wellwritten staying close to the novel and Stanley Kubrick's keen direction is nothing short of meticulous neat beautiful and bold. The film has shortcomings though too. It's way overlong and there are some dry scenes here and there. Although it wouldn't be as true to the book and Kubrick is a stickler about that I think cutting the film down to a more reasonable run time then 2 hours and 32 minutes would have been a good move.If you haven't seen the 1962 original version of 'Lolita' it's a definite must. Most people prefer the newer version with Jeremy Irons and Frank Langella but it's so inferior to Kubrick's version. The recent version may have more sex scenes and more things to sigh in disgust and disapproval over but the old version Kubrick's version is so much more better acted better directed better written and overall more nicely put together then Adrian Lyne's newer film adaptation of Nobokov's novel not to say Lyne's version is bad it's good but just not as good as Kubrick's version. The 1962 'Lolita' is more of a film that would be admired then liked. Most people probably wouldn't be too into it today but for it's time it was one hell of a risky and wellmade picture. That being said 'Lolita' might have lost some if it's quality with age but it's sure still great film from one of the best filmmakers to ever walk the earth Stanley Kubrick.

	schema:reviewBody "The tag line How did they ever make a movie of Lolita? seems appropriate because in short the answer is that they didn't. Kubrick for all his touted genius didn't come close to capturing the book on film. It hardly seems to have much to do with Nabokov at all instead being off the subject and its own unique creature. Although some films can and should be viewed as divorced from their source material I find it difficult to regard this production without comparing it to Nabokov's creation. I wonder why Kubrick interpreted it this way. Putting aside the possible controversy a faithful adaptation may have caused Kubrick chose to emphasize the satirical elements and update it to 1960s culture. Of course Lolita is aged a few years to make the relationship less shocking. As played by Sue Lyon who looks much older she comes off as a typical '60s teenybopper heroine. Kubrick seems to want to parody other movies of this period and the activities of that society and set. The music here is atrocious especially the annoying love theme which resembles swinging gogo music of the era.The story wanders all over the place hardly devoting enough time to central relationship between Humbert Humbert and Lolita. The plot is slight and unfocused preferring to diverge off into subplots that distract from the main story and themes. When the occasional scene does follow the book many occur in a strange seemingly randomchosen fashion it appears almost jarringly out of place with the rest of the action. By incorporating too many elements of diffuse black humor the comic and poignant obsession angle is considerably diluted. The film is also hampered by poor performances by all the major players save Peter Sellers. James Mason is especially weak as Humbert Shelley Winters is unequivocally annoying and Sue Lyon is a completely uninteresting disappointment. Sellers' character of Quilty is allowed to dominate the movie so much I questioned whether this was supposed to be his story. The Quilty character which was essentially a minor through pervasive presence in the novel is brought to the forefront here and Sellers improvises wildly to create a particularly overshadowing creep. As a movie on its own perhaps the Kubrick version works on some level but it fails as an adaptation of Nabokov's novel.".

To think he was watching the same film as I is an odd thought or more pointedly the same magnificent performance from Peter Sellers as Clare Quilty. While I admit the film isn't entirely successful I would say it is at least reasonable in most regards. Well shot and composed by Kubrick I don't see how anyone could doubt its mounting. The opening scene with Sellers riffing off Mason extraordinarily is one of the greatest oddest openings to a film ever. All sorts of protoPinteresque psychological mind games are deployed in this oddest of confrontation scenes. Maybe one might say the film doesn't generally match this inspired quality in the main body of the picture. The scenes which unquestionably do invariably involve Sellers. His portrayal and embellishment of Nabokov's more minor player Quilty is an outstanding success for all the magnetic subtlety of Being There and highoctane comic mastery of Dr Strangelove I feel this performance to be the most magnetic unnerving and ingenious of Sellers' career such as I have seen it. The scenes between Sellers and Mason the incalculably more sedate classical actor are like eras and mindsets shifting uncomfortably and compellingly. Sellers plays Quilty as an amoral jokester a daunting genius alterego of Humbert uninhibited and unrestrained in his gameplaying. I ought to make mention of the party scene early on with Quilty dancing diffidently and cynically with some dame or other. Moments such as this scene in the film are pure acting subtlety demonstrated by Sellers and he practically maintains the compelling interest embodied by this character throughout. Wonderful. Who could forget or indeed ignore as the two previous reviewers have the sublimely tense and comic scene at the hotel with Sellers' and Quilty's policeman probing Humbert in a simultaneously precise and absurd manner. Where some critics have said Sellers' Quilty is overused I would say quite the opposite he could have been used even more although the irregularity and unpredictability of his appearances is tangibly effective.Mason is dependable as Humbert and this mere dependability proves perhaps insufficient in a film dominated by one of the finest performances. The character's passions and motivations are quelled rather than exacerbated by Mason's mannered English gentleman playing of the part. However his bearing and style of acting prove an irresistible counterpoint to Sellers. Kubrick evidently realized on set Sellers' genius for both precise comedic timing and subtle character acting and rightly indulged these attributes. Other players in NabokovKubrickSellers' comedic human pyschodrama are a mixture. Shelley Winters an often unremarkable actress portrays a hilariously unlovely lady very well. A victim as in the majestic The Night of the Hunter Winters proves an elusively cursory actress. The scene where Mason is in the bath and she subsequently dies without the aid of Humbert is a master class in comedic acting from Mason and Winters. Sue Lyon importantly is maybe not quite the Lolita that is required. She's certainly alluring but never quite the right mix of seductive innocence and dispensed nonchalance. She plays the part with maybe an overemphasis on desultory petulance. Full marks though to Kubrick for the influential shots when Humbert sees her for the first time brilliantly done. It is however in the final analysis a mistake or copout of casting to have Sue Lyon a girl of around sixteen rather than someone of the age Nabokov specifies in the novel. It misses or rather skirts around the point of Lolita somewhat.For all the film's faults it's an entertaining provocative more in the sense of Humbert's guilt than in his desires drama with an irreverent thoughtful edge provided by the frighteningly good Sellers. As a film it is far from obsolete as user Hugh comments it is an essential if flawed adaptation of a literary classic. And I'm not being in the least bit sentimental in saying that.Rating ".

And he was confident and he was nearly almighty with his knowledge charm and abilities. Movie's Humbert evokes only pity. I don't say Mason is bad it's just not his character or his strange view of the role.Charlotta is all wrong in the movie. She's this kind of nearly village woman with her poor manners and behavior. She acted in a different way in the book she was a woman of different qualities who wouldn't scream and shout as mad in presence of anyone she wants to have good relationships with for example.Plot is cut events are mixed.

At least Lolita's character doesn't.Humbert was a handsome man a gentleman of Old Good Times in the book. He was attractive in many ways. And he was confident and he was nearly almighty with his knowledge charm and abilities. Movie's Humbert evokes only pity. I don't say Mason is bad it's just not his character or his strange view of the role.Charlotta is all wrong in the movie. She's this kind of nearly village woman with her poor manners and behavior. She acted in a different way in the book she was a woman of different qualities who wouldn't scream and shout as mad in presence of anyone she wants to have good relationships with for example.Plot is cut events are mixed. I can't understand why Kubrick decided to make a movie by this novel. He failed in bringing Lolita to the screen yet he succeeded in making a good film.";

She only asked Peyton How did you become to be a nanny? leaving out relevant questions like health personal background prior jobs resumes way with kids etc. Other than that I enjoyed watching this movie and especially liked Julianne Moore's character with her making smart acid wit remarks.

	schema:reviewBody "Long before the acclaim of L.A. Confidential director Curtis Hansen offered up this trim effectively manipulative and suspenseful film. Sciorra is a pregnant woman whose doctor magnificently slimy de Lancie molests her during an office visit.  The ramifications of her subsequent charges bring about the entrance of De Mornay into her life.  De Mornay poses as a nanny and almost immediately wreaks havoc on Sciorra's household taking charge of it and manipulating the family all while smiling pleasantly.  The story is almost completely implausible and the credibility of the script is stretched further and further as it goes along.  However it matters not because of the surehanded inventive direction and the dedicated performance of De Mornay.  Taking a cue from Hitchcock much of the dirty business occurs in daylight among stark white walls and bright outdoor settings.  De Mornay insinuates herself into the household and into the minds of the viewer with an unsettling and fascinating malevolence.  No one is safe as she meticulously works her dread.  Aside from her plots against Sciorra her shocking behavior includes calling a mentally challenged man a 'retard' and saying the 'F' word to a grade school child. This decidedly unPC approach is at compelling odds with Sciorra and her yuppie husband who both represent everything annoying and stereotypical about their type and status 'talking' to their kids 'processing' everything psychologically et al  They are well off and think they're 'on to' life yet he's a dim bulb and she overreacts to everything possible. This makes a certain faction of the audience delight in seeing them tormented.  Cutting a swath through all the bull is the stunning firebreathing nononsense Moore as Sciorra's friend.  This is one of the greatest supporting turns of the '90's.  She owns every scene she's in yet ultimately can't beat De Mornay thus creating a terrific onscreen rivalry right from the start.  Moore has never looked this wonderful again nor essayed this brittle a role but at least it exists as a monument to her talents at playing a ballbreaking bitch goddess.  The excitement leading up to her confrontation with De Mornay is palpable thanks in part to some great editing.  The male cast is weak.  McCoy is often just plain bad and Hudson is embarrassing as a 'slow' handyman.  Sciorra does well in a part that does her no favors.  The film was a massive surprise hit but she wasn't able to ride it to anything much afterwards.  At least De Mornay was briefly lifted to a higher position in the film industry.  Moore has fared the best.  Zima in her film debut! is exceptionally cute as the daughter and does a great job.  She later won a role on The Nanny.  The film inspired a raft of imitators featuring killersitters killertemps etc... but none found the wide audience that this enjoyed.  It's a credit to De Mornay and Hanson that despite being petite and feminine she comes across as chilling and dangerously strong and violent.".

	schema:headline " Everything was fine until they hired that babysitter...";
	schema:reviewBody "The Hand that Rocks the Cradle is the cornerstone of the trashy chick flick subgenre. Many films since have used the same formula that makes this one a success and most have failed. The reason this film is almost a resounding success has nothing to do with the plot or characters however it's the way that director Curtis Hanson handles it. The man who would go on to find acclaim with the astounding L.A. Confidential directs with the utmost still and while there are few absolutely shocking sequences in this film you would be forgiven for thinking otherwise due to the way that Hanson handles every scene. The movie leaves a lot of room for suspense and every instant is made the best of by the director. The plot seems rather routine these days and it probably did back in 1992 as we see a good allAmerican family hire the 'perfect' babysitter. She's not quite so perfect however and as we watch her pull down the family she's supposed to be helping from within this becomes abundantly clear.One thing that makes this film hard to like for some people is the fact that almost every motivation in the film is extremely unlikely. Would you hire a babysitter who apparently 'just knew' you wanted one? Wouldn't you become suspicious when everything started going wrong after you hired her? The list goes on it really does and it would seem that writer Amanda Silver just wanted to portray certain plots and didn't care too much how the characters fit into them. It's also obvious that the script was written by a woman throughout with many of the sequences being more aimed towards women. None of these bad points really harm it though because it's so well handled that it's hard not to just sit back and enjoy yourself. The centrepiece when it comes to the stagy set pieces is definitely the one with the greenhouse which is both psychologically pleasing and suspense filled. The acting is just fine with Rebecca De Mornay slotting into the deranged psycho role nicely. The best thing about this film for me is definitely the way that the babysitter manipulates the children and engineers situations to her advantage. This may be trash at the end of the day but it's fiendishly done!".

	schema:headline " Predictable at times but De Mornay gives it an edge";
	schema:reviewBody "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle was directed by Curtis Hanson. He is a man who's dabbled in quite a few genres. Passable psychological thrillers like this and The River Wild. Chick flicks like the above average In Her Shoes. And even crime capers like the superb LA Confidential. Hanson's finest hour.Hanson has clearly studied up on his Hitchcock. He knows all about crafting suspense. In fact THTRTC could almost be an exercise in how to make a thriller in the Hitchcock style. There are times when the plot seems a little bit mechanical. But thanks to a quietly sinister performance by Rebecca De Mornay THTRTC is a film I'm proud to have in my film collection.Expectant mother Claire Bartel Annabella Sciorra is sexually molested by her gynaecologist Dr Victor Mott Star Trek's John De Lancie during an exam. When she files a complaint he commits suicide rather than face the consequences. Mott's widow Peyton De Mornay is also expecting. But the stress of losing her husband and than their house causes her to have a miscarriage. While recovering in hospital she sees a news report of Claire's involvement in her husband's death which is frankly a bit contrived and plots revenge.Eight months later Peyton infiltrates the Bartel household as the family babysitter. While there she weaves a complex web of lies deceits and murder to destroy Claire and even steal her husband Michael Matt McCoy and children right out from under her.The Hand That Rocks the Cradle is quite the cautionary tale for the 90s. What a fear for any parent that a trusted babysitter might be trying to steal your kids. And Rebecca De Mornay is perfectly cast in the part. With her angelic face expressive eyes and modulated voice she is perfectly evil.The film is most effective at setting up subtle sinister details that flower into disastrous excess. Like Peyton suggesting a party and through a series of misunderstandings and innuendos left by Peyton like a trail of breadcrumbs Claire ends up humiliating herself in front of her entire family and friends.Any scene with De Mornay is engrossing. Towards the end she surrenders to the clich of full psycho loony. She's more entertaining when she's quietly sowing the seeds of discord and discontent among the Bartel family. Playing Iago to the Bartel's Othello.The scene where she verbally abuses Solomon Ernie Hudson the Bartel's retarded handyman is shocking. Especially when she plants evidence to incriminate him as a paedophile.Annabella Sciorra and Matt McCoy give competent performances even if the film requires a fair bit of stupidity on their part. Its hard to believe it takes them as long as it does for them to figure out that Peyton is the cause of all of their troubles.More engaging are Ernie Hudson and an early role for Julianne Moore as Marlene an exgirlfriend of Michael's. I've always thought Ernie Hudson is an underrated actor and he's excellent in the part because he's the first to see Peyton for the evil woman she really is. Moore's brash performance becomes an impressive parallel versus the icy De Mornay. Their scenes together are wonderfully edgy. One wishes they were paired up together on screen more often. Moore comes to a tragic end when Peyton skillfully manipulates her into a deathtrap.In the final quarter the film pretty much descends into a standard stalkerslasher movie as De Mornay goes into full blown Psycho mode. That's a bit disappointing. Everything else beforehand is more entertaining. Even if the direction is a little too obvious. Catastrophes come at regularly timed intervals to the point that they become predictable.But still thanks to Hanson's smooth direction and a creepy performance by the underrated Rebecca De Mornay The Hand That Rocks the Cradle is a real shocker and its effective enough so that in the future it may convince you to check your babysitter's references that much more thoroughly.".

He knows all about crafting suspense. In fact THTRTC could almost be an exercise in how to make a thriller in the Hitchcock style. There are times when the plot seems a little bit mechanical. But thanks to a quietly sinister performance by Rebecca De Mornay THTRTC is a film I'm proud to have in my film collection.Expectant mother Claire Bartel Annabella Sciorra is sexually molested by her gynaecologist Dr Victor Mott Star Trek's John De Lancie during an exam. When she files a complaint he commits suicide rather than face the consequences. Mott's widow Peyton De Mornay is also expecting. But the stress of losing her husband and than their house causes her to have a miscarriage. While recovering in hospital she sees a news report of Claire's involvement in her husband's death which is frankly a bit contrived and plots revenge.Eight months later Peyton infiltrates the Bartel household as the family babysitter. While there she weaves a complex web of lies deceits and murder to destroy Claire and even steal her husband Michael Matt McCoy and children right out from under her.The Hand That Rocks the Cradle is quite the cautionary tale for the 90s. What a fear for any parent that a trusted babysitter might be trying to steal your kids. And Rebecca De Mornay is perfectly cast in the part. With her angelic face expressive eyes and modulated voice she is perfectly evil.The film is most effective at setting up subtle sinister details that flower into disastrous excess. Like Peyton suggesting a party and through a series of misunderstandings and innuendos left by Peyton like a trail of breadcrumbs Claire ends up humiliating herself in front of her entire family and friends.Any scene with De Mornay is engrossing. Towards the end she surrenders to the clich of full psycho loony. She's more entertaining when she's quietly sowing the seeds of discord and discontent among the Bartel family. Playing Iago to the Bartel's Othello.The scene where she verbally abuses Solomon Ernie Hudson the Bartel's retarded handyman is shocking. Especially when she plants evidence to incriminate him as a paedophile.Annabella Sciorra and Matt McCoy give competent performances even if the film requires a fair bit of stupidity on their part. Its hard to believe it takes them as long as it does for them to figure out that Peyton is the cause of all of their troubles.More engaging are Ernie Hudson and an early role for Julianne Moore as Marlene an exgirlfriend of Michael's. I've always thought Ernie Hudson is an underrated actor and he's excellent in the part because he's the first to see Peyton for the evil woman she really is. Moore's brash performance becomes an impressive parallel versus the icy De Mornay. Their scenes together are wonderfully edgy. One wishes they were paired up together on screen more often. Moore comes to a tragic end when Peyton skillfully manipulates her into a deathtrap.In the final quarter the film pretty much descends into a standard stalkerslasher movie as De Mornay goes into full blown Psycho mode. That's a bit disappointing. Everything else beforehand is more entertaining. Even if the direction is a little too obvious. Catastrophes come at regularly timed intervals to the point that they become predictable.But still thanks to Hanson's smooth direction and a creepy performance by the underrated Rebecca De Mornay The Hand That Rocks the Cradle is a real shocker and its effective enough so that in the future it may convince you to check your babysitter's references that much more thoroughly.";

Rebecca de Mornay is the evil nanny who plots her revenge with relish her satisfaction obvious as her plans begin to bear fruit. The nanny is not swayed by the innocence of the young girl or the newborn baby she is hired to care for and intends to destroy the entire family.

	schema:reviewBody "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle 1992 Starring Rebecca De Mornay Annabella Sciorra Matt McCoy Julianne Moore Ernie Hudson Madeline Zima Jon De Lancie Kevin Skousen Mitchell Lawrence Justin Zaremby Director Curtis Hanson Writer Amanda SilverWhen this domestic suspense thriller was released in 1992 I'm pretty sure dozens of middleclass parents conceived the idea of surveying their babysitters through nanny cameras and considering the possibility the babysitter might be a threat! Meet Peyton Mott Flanders Rebecca De Mornay in a chilling performance. Her husband an obstetrician Dr. Victor Mott has sexually molested the pregnant Mrs. Claire Bartel Annabella Sciorra who reports him to the authorities. Turns out he had been sexually abusing his patients. Victor Mott eventually kills himself which triggers his wife Peyton's miscarriage. Peyton really does have valid reasons to be angry. She has lost everything her husband her baby and her home. But she is so consumed with bitterness and by her desire for revenge that she is stripped of her humanity and becomes an authentic villain so perfect for this type of film. Rebecca De Mornay's nonthreatening beautiful and innocuous Caucasian features are a perfect disguise. She takes a job as babysitter to Claire's daughter Emma. Now safe in the family's trust she conducts scheme after scheme to destroy Claire and to exact revenge. She is breastfeeding Claire's infant to mark the child as hersPeyton proves that women can be just as territorial as men and just as ruthless perhaps more so she wins Emma's trust and affection by forging a false friendship she frames the black help who is a bit weak and slow but proves heroic in the finale by making Claire believe he is sexually molesting Emma she hides Emma's panties in a drawer in the storage room. She even tries to break up Claire and her husband by making Claire believe that he is having an affair with his old friend and sweetheart played by Julian Moore in a minor role early in her career and Peyton even attempts to seduce Claire's husband. There is no stopping her until her comeuppance comes just in time for the ending. The dangerous outsider coming into the safety of a perfectly happy family really works as a thriller in cinema. We cannot sympathize with Peyton because she is a very corrupt and vicious woman. Although we would like to see Claire Sciorra's character be more defensive and try to protect her family and even eliminate the villain herself we cannot help but worry how it will turn out for her since she is not a very strong woman and is in fact a victim of asthma. The real star of the show is Rebecca De Mornay anyways and so it was fitting that Claire is a weak contrast by comparison to Rebecca's powerfully evil performance. The location was shot in Southern California somewhere near the Hollywood Hills or perhaps a suburban community is tailormade for the ambiance of a dark film such as this one. Who'd ever guess that such intense crime could happen in a small town that looks blameless ? The music is effectively chilling although the composer or music editor seems to have delighted in playing with the theme of innocence mingled with evil the soprano aria Poor Wondering One from the Gilbert and Sullivan opera The Pirates Of Penzance is played repeatedly as it seems to be an album that Claire has in her house. At one point the orchestral score twists the cheerful melody by using darker and menacing instrumental themes so that Poor Wondering One sounds more serious and visceral. The rest of the music is appropriately detached shocking and like most other thriller movie scores.The Hand That Rocks The Cradle Is The Hand That Rules The World.".

However Curtis Hanson a director who after this would move on to one more suspense movie THE RIVER WILD before cementing his status in Hollywood as a powerhouse director capable of telling acute stories in any genre had in his hands an okay story. What he did with it is something else.Two women are unknowingly at the heart of a tragedy when one of them Claire gets touched inappropriately by her gynecologist and suffers an asthma attack. She sues he commits suicide and his wife suffers a miscarriage. But she's decided not to let matters heal by themselves. No. Peyton Flanders has more up her sleeve than anyone will imagine. She's going to make Claire's life a living hell. And take over her life her husband and her little baby.So off she goes to the Bartel household in Perfect Suburbia and manages to get herself hired as their nanny. Of course she's so absolutely sweet she basically is a walking ad for Stepford niceness. Anyone would have a go at her as a nanny or anything else. Andrea Yates move aside. Peyton is in the house.What Claire and Michael Matt McCoy don't know is that little by little Peyton is taking over the house. It's always like this the targets never know they're in danger until the water is up to their neck and rising quite rapidly. And it's little things. The baby seems to be happier with Peyton than with Claire but that's okay apparently she has a good hand with babies. Then again the nursery has been changed and looks surprisingly like another nursery. Of course anyone who has seen through Peyton's charm might be well advised not to walk into the family greenhouse. Or leave aspirators unattended. Marlene Julianne Moore then unknown a family friend warns Michael on Peyton but it leads to more confusion.Rebecca De Mornay never had a role as good as this one and never has had one since. With Peyton she could have even garnered an Oscar nod but maybe it wasn't her time. All she could hope for is that audiences see her controlled features always ready for a smile hiding an insane rage that explodes in one spellbinding sequence as she destroys a bathroom  such is the intensity of the hatred her character feels towards Claire who only reported an incident not knowing it would lead to this.Annabella Sciorra has an equally difficult role to do because her character is the victim. There's an elegance in the way she reads her lines  she comes across as very poised  and her way of playing into the rising disquiet within Claire is pretty keen. It's the first of a short cycle of roles she would play where she would be the victim here however she is firstrate the camera loves showing her from different angles as if observing her go from calm to progressively worked up to allout insane.Curtis Hanson has made an excellent sharp thriller that rises well above the trashy material that it originates from. It's easy to forget the coincidence involving the two women and as I've stated before it would have been best not to explain or show the real meaning behind a person's rage but have it exist making that person even creepier. Even so Hanson constructs his movie carefully never allowing for any Boo! moments to come through until the moment when events lead to graphic violence make way for a couple of them even then controlled. THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE manages in this way to be a compelling clever watch even when there are times it shouldn't be.".

Its a risky thing and purely cinematic as the wheels grind on this ordinary story.The story is along the lines of Othello characters that are quite to trust and equally quick to suspect. The problem is that it ends in no interesting way we get nothing as a reward for being manipulated all tensed up. Everything ends well the bad guy is punished. I suppose I would have tolerated it even recommended elements of it to you were it not for the hackneyed bit at the end our villainess falls on a picket fence and spikes are driven through her. Is there a more hackneyed possibility? Yes. In this case the construction of that same picket fence by a special person from a place with a revealing name is what begins the movie.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".

Its a risky thing and purely cinematic as the wheels grind on this ordinary story.The story is along the lines of Othello characters that are quite to trust and equally quick to suspect. The problem is that it ends in no interesting way we get nothing as a reward for being manipulated all tensed up. Everything ends well the bad guy is punished. I suppose I would have tolerated it even recommended elements of it to you were it not for the hackneyed bit at the end our villainess falls on a picket fence and spikes are driven through her. Is there a more hackneyed possibility? Yes. In this case the construction of that same picket fence by a special person from a place with a revealing name is what begins the movie.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.";

Nor are characters immune to the lack of realism. The child's lines and emotional responses are laughably fake and by the way this film isn't any less shy about black caricatures than it is about female nudity. There's not much reward to watching the final 15 minutes either unless a catfight and cheap BOO! scares are your thing.Skip this and go for another Fatal Attraction rental.".

	schema:reviewBody "This came out at the time when there was something of a plethora of 'home invasion' thrillers presumably as a result of the phenomenal success of Fatal Attraction. There we had the mistress from hell closely followed by the tenant from hell in Pacific Heights the policeman from hell in Unlawful Entry the roommate from hell in Single White Female and the husband from hell in Deceived. All followed a similar formula including the predictable thrillaminute denouement which clearly ruined Fatal Attraction. The Hand that rocks the Cradle was a sizeable hit at the time and certainly featured a pretty unnerving performance from DeMornay who it appeared would go on to have the kind of box office pull that the likes of Julia Roberts Meg Ryan and Geena Davies were having at the time. It never really happened and I believe she's stuck on some American TV show like ER  poor thing. This thriller does have quite a neat little screenplay even though it is more involving earlier on when DeMornay's more subtle methods of undermining the nuclear family's stability are quite cleverly done. However it soon degenerates into bog standard American thriller territory and less face it any film whose principle message is don't mess with the nuclear family deserves some scorn. There is a dreadful supporting character of a black retard who you know will somehow save the day as soon as you see him in the opening shot. A dreadful stereotype. Also the husband is quite faintly ridiculous. Have you ever seen a more sensitive and sickly sweet husband in cinema history? When he gets knocked down towards the end of the film and states 'I can't move my legs are broken' and yet appears to be in no agony at all you realise his role is barely perfunctory. Obviously the whole thing is very unbelievable  how she was able to become a nanny within just 6 months of losing her husband and the baby is extraordinary and at no point in the film was she aware that the husband occasionally smoked and yet she used the friends' lighter as a plant to cause havoc at the surprise party. So yes plenty of holes in it but hey its' an American film so no European will watch it expecting intelligence I guess.".

The plot is a fascinating web of deceit and intrigues built around having babies holding onto a husband maintaining an uppermiddleclass lifestyle surprise birthday parties and sharing secrets.I enjoy watching it once in a while because it's so well plotted  and I can handle a bit of violence even absent exploding heads and car chases and erupting fireballs. It's kind of soothing really when the worst death is implausibly caused by some falling glass from a greenhouse overhead.The guys are faithful but pretty much helpless to stop the goings on of the beautiful young but evil nanny De Mornay. The black retarded housekeeper and the bearded husband of Annabella Sciora are both dutiful but dumb. Nobody is about to believe the big and brutish AfricanAmerican handyman who can hardly get out a believable sentence when confronted by a clever manipulative blond little De Mornay. And Hubby aside from looking a little wimpish is thoroughly disabled by one whack in the face from De Mornay's shovel. He falls off a staircase and breaks both legs so he's unable to do anything during the final confrontation between the superhumanly bitter De Mornay and the terrified asthmatic wife.This is where the gender bifurcation is most obvious. There must of course be a final conflict between the villainous creep and the honest wife. In any movie of this kind written and directed by a man the climactic confrontation would involve exactly 112 Uzi automatic pistols. Not just the interior of the house but the surrounding landscape for miles around would be shredded by bullets.But what happens here? De Mornay has a poker and is trying to kidnap the baby. In a man's movie it would be money or a woman. Sciorra rushes at her with a knife but is quickly disarmed. She falls to the floor wheezing desperately as she is crippled by her asthma. And what does De Mornay do? Does she bash in Sciorra's head with that bad old poker she's carrying? Nope. She kneels down and begins to whisper to Sciorra  When your husband makes love to you it's my face he's thinking about. And then De Mornay continues trying to INSULT Sciorra TO DEATH!!! Would such a means of committing a murder even enter a man's head? It's a refreshing change from the ordinary thriller. There's no mystery involved. A nice genre piece worth catching.".

Elaine a scientist seeks confirmation on what may be a turning point issue in her life by an unconventional means namely a tarot card reading. Although the news Elaine receives through the reading is a largely accurate assessment of her current life it is the news about that crossroads issue that takes her somewhat aback. In Fantasies About Rebecca thirtynine year old Rebecca Waynon is outwardly in control of her life from her job as a bank manager to her personal long term relationship with older Robert. A homeless woman named Nancy who hangs around outside the bank seems to have a clearer picture of what is truly happening with Rebecca than Rebecca herself as is witnessed by Rebecca's ultimate reaction to an action in dealing with...";

	schema:reviewBody "Things you can tell just by looking at herIn Things you can tell just by looking at her we meet several women who for different reasons seem to be playing bit parts in their own lives. One of them takes care of her mother in a big lonely house Rebecca stops listening to her own feelings because a baby does not fit into the life of her married lover Rose discovers that her son is growing up Calista's girlfriend is dying and ? takes care of her blind sister.After watching the film I thought what does this film want to tell us about women? Or perhaps people in general. Some of the lines in the film stuck in my mind The blind girl says about the woman who committed suicide I bet you could tell just by looking at her that there was a man involved.' When giving this line some thought I starting seeing the film as a comment on loneliness' in general. What do people really want? They want to be involved with people. They want other people to see them.The film suggests that when people don't depend on anyone anymore when they have no one to be' for   they chose to actually become nothing to die. The loneliness at the heart of existence is too hard to bear. I think the film is about the nature of making connections and being involved with other people although it is painful and sometimes lead to selfsacrifice. It shows us the horror which is tied with the fear of being left alone although the connections which are made does little to remove the feeling of loneliness. It is the horror of a stranger walking into your personal sphere and immediately being able to see through you and see what lies beneath the surface. It is the horror of revealing your interest in other people  looking in on other peoples lives in a desperate attempt to connect and to become involved. It is the horror of becoming involved with someone who cannot stay the horror of losing those whom you connect with. When you are involved and when you connect with someone you face the danger of being hurt being dumped   of sacrificing your own life in your care for others. It is the horror also that your sacrifice is not appreciated the horror that when you are no longer a lover or a mother then you will certainly become nothing that your identity is so intricately tied with the dependence of those who need you that you cannot be you' if they don't need you anymore.  It is ultimately the horror of being defined by relations of interdependence where the people you care for in effect give you identity. It is the horror that you really are nothing without other people to mirror yourself in.Why is this form of selfsacrifice' then particular to women? We learn from Walter's daughter that when he really gets involved He dumps them like a hot potato'. Are women victims and easy to exploit? Rose's teenage son confides that people are always' looking for someone. But is the act of making these connections and becoming involved truly more important to women  truly more essential in their attempt at becoming someone  of gaining an identity. Are women always characterized by either being cared for or being the ones who take care of others? Interestingly none of these women are wives  they are defined by other types of relationships than those that arise between man and wife.I do not think I can answer these questions and I don't think the film wants to answer them either. But I think the film is a point of departure for discussing the nature of being  and the way we all perhaps depend upon others in order to become.710".

I don't know and I'm still angry about that since it has a great cast and was very well received in Cannes. Fortunately it was received a limited release here in Brazil where it was a kind of arthouse hit during the time of the year when only blockbusters have their place in the sun. The secret of its success here is not hard to understand audiences who were tired of Hollywood crap found a small quiet dramatic comedy with a good story some heartbreaking moments and some very funny ones too and terrific performances. This is the kind of film that touches everyone even the coldest and most serious person making them laugh and feel deep emotions. Despite its division in five stories all of them excellent except the part with the lesbian which was too small this film is carefully paced helping us to understand each character's emotions. And each story has an interesting link to the other.If I had to choose my favorite part I would have to think. The Dr. Keener story is sad and quiet the one with Rebecca is the most thoughtprovoking while the dwarf story is touching and funny and the sistersister story brilliantly closes the film.If you haven't seen this yet watch it now. There are not many good films with women as the main subject but this one is one of the best I've seen. It has an eye for detail it makes us think with its reflection about what women are nowadays I loved Cameron Diaz guessing about what made her sister's friend committing suicide. And there are great actresses which seem to fit the role perfectly Glenn Close Cameron Diaz Amy Brennemann Kathy Baker Holly Hunter Calista Flockhart and Valeria Golino. I hope Rodrigo Garcia son of famed writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez makes other great films like this.".

Many conditions must coalesce and only a few actors can rise to the challenge Penn is the current master with PS Hoffman coming up.This film takes another more elegant and though novel more satisfying approach. Many good actresses are involved. The dimensions are separated into five threads which we are helped to rebraid through the careful efforts of those actresses.What we have is one prototypical character portrayed five different ways by actresses that have radically different acting styles. Each focuses entirely on her own weaving but it is clear that they are aware of the others. Hunter's mouth during the baglady's harangue deliberately quotes Close's during the tarot session. Hunter's stagger after the abortion has a couple steps in there from Close's demented mother. Flockhart's dying lover has some literally copied breaths taken from Hunter's abortion...No medium is quite like film. All art is a conversation between the artist and the recipient. But only in film is there an explicit party interjected  the actor  who can represent either the viewer or the artist or neither or both or themselves. In addition to the multidimensionality of the actors' roles the writing here places the actors in shifting stances shifting through all the choices listed. There is no selfreference that would distract. everything is focused on me and Garcia and the connection is manifold.And what focus! How close to the bones of womanhood can one get? How deeply into the mysteries of connection can one go? Connections between lovers of course but the feminine nature of the connection that film can afford us between writer and our inner selves. Not since Polanski have I seen such sculptural direction with women. I wish we could see just what was the dialog between director and actress to coax such bare clean performances.The writing too. Screen writing is the hardest thing to do when you want to be true. You've got to be fake in just the right way to appear true. Flat truth always is fake. Only the most deft artifice can be true. Only the truly delicate writer can be deft with a woman's heart which after all is the nexus of truth. Only the writer who knows all the tricks of the film stage can remove the wires and let that honesty fly.We have here a new talent. You really must see this film.Whatever Ms Flockhart is doing on TeeVee is certainly a waste.".

The dimensions are separated into five threads which we are helped to rebraid through the careful efforts of those actresses.What we have is one prototypical character portrayed five different ways by actresses that have radically different acting styles. Each focuses entirely on her own weaving but it is clear that they are aware of the others. Hunter's mouth during the baglady's harangue deliberately quotes Close's during the tarot session. Hunter's stagger after the abortion has a couple steps in there from Close's demented mother. Flockhart's dying lover has some literally copied breaths taken from Hunter's abortion...No medium is quite like film. All art is a conversation between the artist and the recipient. But only in film is there an explicit party interjected  the actor  who can represent either the viewer or the artist or neither or both or themselves. In addition to the multidimensionality of the actors' roles the writing here places the actors in shifting stances shifting through all the choices listed. There is no selfreference that would distract. everything is focused on me and Garcia and the connection is manifold.And what focus! How close to the bones of womanhood can one get? How deeply into the mysteries of connection can one go? Connections between lovers of course but the feminine nature of the connection that film can afford us between writer and our inner selves. Not since Polanski have I seen such sculptural direction with women. I wish we could see just what was the dialog between director and actress to coax such bare clean performances.The writing too. Screen writing is the hardest thing to do when you want to be true. You've got to be fake in just the right way to appear true. Flat truth always is fake. Only the most deft artifice can be true. Only the truly delicate writer can be deft with a woman's heart which after all is the nexus of truth. Only the writer who knows all the tricks of the film stage can remove the wires and let that honesty fly.We have here a new talent. You really must see this film.Whatever Ms Flockhart is doing on TeeVee is certainly a waste.";

	schema:headline " Powerful Performances Drive This Incisive Drama";
	schema:reviewBody "A sensitive and incisive episodic drama that examines loneliness and need emotional vulnerability and the true meaning of character Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her' written and directed by Rodrigo Garcia presents a glimpse into the lives of seven women that is not only thoughtful but filled with some real insights into human nature.  Though the stories are independent and unrelated the film demonstrates how the lives of people can and do overlap and whether or not they affect one another in any way there are things these individuals have in common that have to do with relationships or the lack thereof and is seemingly steeped in pain despair indecisiveness and longing.  It's a dialogue driven character study that may be the antithesis of a feelgood film but it's riveting drama that is extremely well presented and acted and most importantly it is very real and believable and will certainly contain elements to which just about anyone in the audience will be able to relate and identify because they are so truetolife.  What you see in this film may not be entirely pleasant but it provides some thoughtprovoking reflective moments that are in some cases veritably transporting and many that are bound to hit very close to home for many viewers.  Garcia seems to have a firm grasp of the female perspective and sensibility and presents the stories of these women in a way that allows you to empathize with all of them on a number of different levels.  And he wisely offsets the drama by infusing a bit of tasteful humor at just the right moments bittersweet though it may be without it the film would have been just too dark and as it is it hovers dangerously close to the cusp of the abyss as he layers one disconcerting situation upon another with little respite.  It may sound like strong stuff and it is but it does what a film like this is supposed to do  It makes you feel' something consider some things and enables you to possibly come to terms with some emotions that otherwise you may be wont to avoid altogether.  In the end then it makes for a truly satisfying and fulfilling experience.Garcia put together a terrific ensemble cast to tell his story which resulted in a number of exemplary performances most notably by Cameron Diaz who plays Carol a blind woman who refuses to acquiesce to the constant compromises life offers her.  She displays a fortitude that is inspiring and demonstrates that real vision as well as true beauty transcends the physical.  In her darkness she sees and understands the world more clearly than many who see perfectly but are blind in other ways and though in the care of her sister Kathy Amy Brenneman it is she who enables Kathy to finally get a grasp on her own life.  It's a wonderful performance by Diaz who continues to prove that she is so much more than just another pretty face up there on the screen.Another memorable performance is turned in by Kathy Baker as Rose the single mother of a fifteenyearold son Jay Noah Fleiss who is a woman of true inner beauty.  Rose is a former teacher who now writes children's storybooks whom Baker instills with qualities that make her endearing and very real including the capacity to look beyond herself and reach out to others which in turn makes that necessary connection with the audience and predisposes the emotional involvement that makes her story so poignant and honest.  There's a gentleness that Baker brings to this role and an openness that makes it one of the best she's ever done. Notable performances are given as well by Glenn Close as Dr. Elaine Keener who has recently arrived at something of a crossroads in her life Calista Flockhart as Christine a fortune teller whose own future with her girlfriend Lilly Valeria Golino is clouded and Holly Hunter as Rebecca a thirtynineyearold bank manager coping with the emptiness in her life brought about by in retrospect some questionable decisions she's made.  It is rare in fact to find so many singularly exceptional performances in a motion picture.  The supporting cast includes Matt Craven Walter Gregory Hines Robert Miguel Sandoval Sam Danny Woodburn Albert and Penelope Allen Nancy. Engrossing drama delivered with integrity and subtle nuance by Garcia and his impeccable cast Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her' in an introspective treatise on life and the many aspects of it that are common but rarely shared because of the fact that so many people live as Carol says at one point Behind closed doors.'  It's a powerful film that makes a real impact without ever hitting you over the head with the weight of it's collective angst.  And it's an important film in that it will make you think and consider things that are too often put off or ignored entirely and often to the detriment of personal happiness and when the medium of the filmmaker can maybe turn that around it demonstrates what the magic of the movies is really all about.  I rate this one 910.".

	onyx:emotionText "A sensitive and incisive episodic drama that examines loneliness and need emotional vulnerability and the true meaning of character Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her' written and directed by Rodrigo Garcia presents a glimpse into the lives of seven women that is not only thoughtful but filled with some real insights into human nature.  Though the stories are independent and unrelated the film demonstrates how the lives of people can and do overlap and whether or not they affect one another in any way there are things these individuals have in common that have to do with relationships or the lack thereof and is seemingly steeped in pain despair indecisiveness and longing.  It's a dialogue driven character study that may be the antithesis of a feelgood film but it's riveting drama that is extremely well presented and acted and most importantly it is very real and believable and will certainly contain elements to which just about anyone in the audience will be able to relate and identify because they are so truetolife.  What you see in this film may not be entirely pleasant but it provides some thoughtprovoking reflective moments that are in some cases veritably transporting and many that are bound to hit very close to home for many viewers.

	schema:reviewBody "Last month Sep 2001 the Atlantic Monthly ran an article addressing the new trend of slow and hyperstylized novels masquerading as selfproclaimed literary novels. If the article had instead focused on plotless movies that aspire to be films this would have been a prime example. The only thing that kept me from voting this a 1 was the uniformly excellent cast and a the wonderful character of  a zesty blind woman played by Cameron Diaz and a charming dwarf an actor I'm not familiar with. The problem with this selfconsciously styled women's art movie is that it is neither particularly artistic nor particularly insightful about women although there have been many insightful films done about women by male directors this is not one of them. The film flirts with a trendy collage format that flickers between different points in time and threads them together by the forced conceit of a suicidal brunette who acts as a time marker. The compelling idea of interlaced stories is here made merely distractingthere are at least 5 main characters I'm probably missing somebody its just too hard to keep track of their relationships let alone figure out how their stories are interrelated.The connections are hardly meaningful anyways example Cameron Diaz is the blind pianist alluded to in a brief anecdote of Calista Flockheart's to her dying lover in one story of the movie. Cameron Diaz is also tutoring the daughter of the man who was a one night stand for Holly  Hunter in yet another story.The movies main offense is in trying so hard to be smart that it is forgets to be entertaining. The editing is AWFUL. Apparently whoever was doing the final cut was taught that focusing on a character spacing out for minutes at a time would prod viewers to imagine what the characters were really thinking. I found myself wondering what the DIRECTOR was thinking. This is truly the stuff bad literature is made of. Skip it. If you enjoy the idea of overlapping stories I suggest the Blue White and Red series Blue with Juliette Binoche is especially fine and Red is thought provoking. For a Bgrade shmaltzy movie that is still  infinately more enjoyable than things you can tell by looking at her try Playing By Heart. At least the Angelina Jolie vignette is consistently interesting. For a more sincere womens movie try steel magnolias fried green tomatos or Angelina's Line.".

This is one of those movies that used all the funny clips in the trailer. If you go in thinking it will be a funny movie it will disappoint you. There are so many problems with the acting script editing and direction. Unfortunately Dance Flick did not meet my expectations. I did laugh at many of the scenes but the few laughs that I did have weren't enough. At least the movie was short. I would not recommend this movie to anyone so save your money and see something else. Paramount Pictures Run Time 123 Rated PG13210".

But ever since the FriedbergSeltzer team has joined in the I can make a movie too bandwagon we were begging the Waynes Brothers to come back. The last really funny spoof movies are the Scary Movie series they were clever and in our faces about the clichs in horror movies. The past few years we have had a major thing with dance movies like Save the Last Dance Step Up Stomp the Yard You Got Served Honey etc. Leave it to the Wayanes Brothers to finally put this genre in it's over clichd and overused scripts in it's place. Unfortunately Dance Flick did not meet my expectations it was one of those movies that used all the funny clips in the trailer. I can't even believe how many problems there was with this movie wither it's the editing acting or direction Dance Flick is a let down.Megan is a former dancer who goes to a new school where everyone can magically sing and dance. She meets some new friends like Tracy Charity and Thomas who is in a street dance gang. When Thomas and Megan connect they must face their impossible dreams together. Trying to bring it they work together to bring the ultimate dance group together. They also must face the difficulty of having a interracial relationship as black women and white men passing them by they try to pretend their love isn't real. But will they put all aside to help Thomas and his crew win the five grand to pay back his sponsor? Well if you've see the dance flicks of the past decade you know how it goes.Now for some odd reason I did get a few laughs out of a stupid movie like Meet the Spartans but that was because I kept my expectations low and knew what I was going into. With Dance Flick it was completely different I was really excited because we have a really funny team working on the film. But they relied too much on the gross jokes instead of getting a laugh from them they keep pushing on the gross jokes too much on the audience and it just didn't work. The actors seemed to force their comedy too much as well where they were just not funny. The movie was also like most spoof movies was way too short as well the stories didn't make sense and were just too random. I'm sorry to say that Dance Flick is just a bad movie it has a couple giggles here and there but the audience was silent throughout most of the film. I'd say to skip the movie if you really want to see it go for the rental.210".

Many spoofs in this film were unnecessary and just plain unfunny like the spoof of Ray Charles from Ray Fame and others. Spoofing Ray Charles was a surprise because Ray isn't a dance movie and this movie is called Dance Flick. They also spoofed Twilight at the very ending. I didn't laugh at anything except a few chuckles. And like others have said many of the funny scenes were in the trailers. One funny scene was towards the end with the final you got served dance scene with the fat guy dancing. Also credit to Shawn Wayans character and Affion Crockett Acon he was pretty funny.

	schema:headline " Definitely not Scary Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw previews for this film on TV I got excited because I am such a fan of the Wayans films such as White Chicks and the first two Scary Movies. While this film definitely had it's share of funny jokes there was nothing original to it. A lot of the quotes from the original movies that it was spoofing were kept the same or extremely similar without much humor really added. The young male lead did a good job I will have to say though. I didn't recognize him as someone I had seen in movies before but then I realized that he was one of the Wayans men as well. This movie was definitely better than the disastrous Superhero Movie and all of the other recent spoof films but didn't live up to the potential that it really could have had. I don't know if the Wayans brothers are losing their touch or just wanted to give the next generation a place to try out his talent but if I were you I wouldn't pay more than the couple of dollars it takes to rent it. Definitely one to rent before you buy.".

While this film definitely had it's share of funny jokes there was nothing original to it. A lot of the quotes from the original movies that it was spoofing were kept the same or extremely similar without much humor really added.

	schema:reviewBody "I can't believe the creators of this movie think they have the right to actually diss Employee of the Month2006 which I admit was not a good film but I was just astounded. Now I will admit the movie did give me a few chuckles but that is cause of how stupid the parodies in this is but few of the parodies was a bit entertaining since I got most of it. I sometimes enjoy stupid comedies but the stupidity of this movie was just too much to the point it just gave me a bit of a head ache. The story is retarded and very simple a girl named Megan who does ballet meets up with some wannabe break dancer ThomasDamon Wayans Jr. And they get some wacky romance going with a bunch of stupid crude jokes thrown in to lengthen the run time which would actually have been a very short movie without it. The thing about the jokes in this movie despite it being not funny is just way too drawn out. It just seems they went to great efforts to throw in unfunny jokes. If your someone who seen a lot of movies and get the parodies will find some of it to be very slightly amusing. But if you don't get what they are doing parodies of you just won't get the dumb joke because it's a inside joke for the people that has seen the movie they are trying to do parodies of and it's even a lousy attempt at that. And there is a heck load of parodies thrown in from a heck load of movies. It's just obvious the Wayans brothers was just trying to cash in because they basically used the best bits for the trailer which wasn't even funny so if you seen the trailer there really isn't a point to seeing this movie. This movie just makes black people look bad in my opinion. The jokes are just vulgar and messed up while trying to go in the shock humor direction while trying to entertain the audience with the suffering of some of the characters in the movie. Which is fine if it was funny but that is not the case and it just feels like it's you that is being tormented. I must say they must have either payed the lead actress a lot of money for this role or she was just desperate for fame. The film is racist and sexist and like I said is fine by me if it is funny but it just isn't. This is one of those comedies where everyone is obnoxious and semiretarded and I seen this types of comedies do quite well if they go in the right direction. But Dance Flick is just a jumbled mess and when the film is finished you start to wonder what just happened because of the stupidity. And I ain't one of those critics that think they are more intelligent and superior to everyone else and go around bashing on dumb comedies that are actually quite entertaining for not being smart. But this film deserves to be bashed on. But like I said if you get the parodies of other films which is strung up very randomly for laughs you might find it slightly amusing and will survive through it.310".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw the preview for this one I found myself hoping against hope that the family that brought us I'm Gonna Get You Sucka and In Living Color would step up to offer us a funny movie after White Chicks and Little Man. Honestly I never bothered to watch those films as the trailers were so screamingly unfunny to me.And now I find myself horrified at the average rating of 3.3 out of ten on IMDbas of opening weekend for Dance Flick which I consider a loooong awaited return to form for Keenan Ivory Wayans and a revelation of the rebirth of that satirical spark from the earliest days of In Living Color. In fact Dance Flick even tops all modern attempts at satire by Zucker proteges Friedberg and Seltzer Disaster MovieMeet the Spartans Epic Movie Date Movie and even David Zucker himself though curiously it seemed to me that Shawn and Marlon Wayans were in his orbit for an over decade long meltdown including his involvement in the Scary Movie series and finally last year's unfunny and politically confused An American Carol.Here's reason  1 why Dance Flick tops it it shows every sign that it was made by adults who actually watched the movies they're lampooning in their entireity Gasp! Imagine that!. It's not surprising to me that a number of the more negative reviews on here ignore jokes based on movies like Little Miss Sunshine or Twilight since those gags seemed to have been written by people who sat and watched more than the trailers for those films.Reason 2 A good cast given a chance to shine. David Alan Grier's Showgirls parody was a great use of DAG's singing talents. Yes he had to act through a fat suit for most of this film ala Martin Lawrence and Eddie Murphy but his performance so made up for his participation in Zucker's Carol.Essence Atkins is hilarious as Charity the student mom who hangs her baby carrier up in her locker baby intact telling the waif to breathe through the vents.Shoshanna Bush plays Megan White who makes a bizarre choice for her Julliard audition and whose mom seems on the edge of a tragic fate in one of the funnier sequences in the film.Damon Wayans Jr. however is a revelation as a chip off a really funny block. He plays Thomas Uncles if you can't sit well with that joke please go rent I'm Gonna Get You Sucka and then we'll talk a young dancer in a street crew who's also a starryeyed med school hopeful in what's described as a Cosby sweater. Damon Jr. shows acting and humor chops equal to any in the previous generation of Wayans and hopefully gets the chance to work on something at least this funny again.Reason  3 The director. Damien Dante Wayans demonstrates the difference between throwing a grab bag of lame material at the screen versus an attempt at layers of jokes.Reason  4 Continuity. This film finally feels like a product produced by people responsible for Hollywood Shuffle and I'm Gonna Get You Sucka. I'd gladly watch this film again right alongside the previous two. Each of the films take out the satirical knives to point out the silliness inherent in a lot of pop cinema but with affection.Reason  5 The jokes are funny. The movie is chockablock with welltimed gags right down to the set decoration and costuming. Yes there is evidence of jokes about Hairspray and Ray that are barely used and the film is far from perfect. But the difference is in the funny. This is and is so worth your time.".

	schema:headline " Tired even by the spoof genre level of films";
	schema:reviewBody "The Wayans family passes the torch to the next generation with yet another painful spoof film of the seemingly endless urban dance films that seem to pop up in the multiplex every couple of weeks. I don't really see the point since anyone who's seen any of the films spoofed would agree that many are actually pretty funny in their own right.

	schema:headline " For a ridiculous genre Dance Flick actually pulls it off";
	schema:reviewBody "There is one thing in film that I can't stand especially in the last new millennium is the spoof genre. The ridiculous over the top disgusting humor that forces jokes into a tired story by making fun of various types of movies that don't deserve being made fun of. Scary Movie brought stupidity to a whole new level. The quality of films in the spoof genre shrank to the worse level of stupidity after the nineties leaving behind the Naked Gun films Airplane and classics like that. All this being said imagine my shock when Dance Flick actually turned in a reasonably less stupid and actually funny even if it was guilty pleasure laughing with a decent story no matter how silly it might be. The films they poke fun at actually work into their story and they use the teen dance flick Save The Last Dance as the basis of their story and that works too. The cast really meld well together and the toilet humor is in full swing which is almost a given with this type of movie in some ways it always has been. But repeatedly I found myself laughing and shaking my head at the pure silliness but yet still entertaining me so bravo to them.Relative newcomer Shoshana Bush leads the cast as dancing hopeful and awkward clutz Megan. In true comedienne style Bush uses physical comedy and terrific facial expressions to really bring home the laughs. She likely has a promising career in comedy if she gets out of this spoof genre because as okay as this movie is...it's not likely to get her anywhere. Damon Wayans Jr. continues the Wayan's shaky ground career in spoof movies lord knows the Scary Movie films were enough to make me never watch a spoof movie again. However Wayans Jr. does a decent job of not overdoing the slapstick comedy a mistake his father made on numerous occasions. Wayans Jr. And Bush are kind of cute together but then don't have a lot of chemistry. Essence Atkins plays Wayans Jr's sister Charity and she is hilarious. Her over the top performance really stands out in this cast and she is ridiculously funny. Veteran young actor Affion Crockett is also good very funny and not overused as the best friend ACon.If I sound like I'm talking this movie up like it's a must see treat of the year then let me back pedal. I still hate spoof movies and if I could go back in time I probably would have saved the Microsoft points I rented it on Xbox 360 and not paid money or currency for this. That being said if you stumble onto it via cable or someone else rents it and forces you to watch it then you won't be at a complete loss of an hour and a half or less. Fortunately like many spoof films it has a mercifully short run time. The ridiculousness will make you smile despite yourself and the cast is decent enough to make it work. So if you can lower your intelligence or if you actually enjoy parodyspoof movies then this one is at least redeemable and that is saying something. 610".

There are quite a few laughs to be found throughout the scattergun approach but there are also many more moments that fall flat. What passes for a plot centres around the relationship that develops between Thomas Damon Wayans Jr a street dancer and Megan Shoshana Bush a classically trained dancer when they meet at a talent school. Thomas is involved in street battles and desperately needs to win an up and coming competition to pay back money he owes. Dance Flick has been cowritten by siblings Marlon Keenen Ivory and Shawn Wayans who have been the creative mainstays of their films over the years. But the film introduces a whole new generation of Wayans into the filmmaking fold both behind the camera and as onscreen talent. Making his directorial debut is their nephew Damien Dante Wayans who has worked on TV series such as My Wife And Kids and it is obvious that he shares his uncles' comic sensibilities and appreciation of cheap sight gags.

Specifically Dance Flick pokes fun at Fame Save the Last Dance Drumline Hairspray Center Stage Step Up Roll Bounce Stomp the Yard Step Up Step Up 2 the Streets and the High School Musical movies. Dance Flick ranks as the best parody movie since Superhero Movie 2008. Moreover the Wayans have ripped into some classics such as West Side Story and Singing in the Rain. Indeed the fun of most parodies is spotting the movie being jeered first and hoping second that you'll cheer the jeers. Even if you loved the movie getting mocked a good parody can make you appreciate your favorite movie more because it pays tribute to it.Not nearly as scatological as the first two Scary Movies Dance Flick relies on the usual hilarious sight gags that the Wayans deploy throughout their derivative often lowestcommondenominator plot to skewer the conventions and clichs of those terpsichorean tales. Unless you've seen the aforementioned films you may not be laughing when others are roaring. Sometimes the Wayans insert some pungent political satire into this brisk 83 minute epic but it doesn't distract from the overall antics. You rarely have enough time to read all the whacky wall signs plastered in every shot because the film flies by so quickly.After her mom dies in a tragic auto accident rushing to her daughter's Juilliard dance audition Megan Shoshana Bush of Fired Up relocates to the big city to live with her destitute father Chris Elliot of Cabin Boy in his condemned apartment. Like everything else in the audacious Dance Flick the demise of Megan's mother is played strictly for laughs. In fact she escapes from her wrecked vehicle only to be struck by a car with a Lindsay vanity license tag. Another vehicle with a Brandy vanity tag hits her. Finally a third vehicle with a Halle vanity tag strikes her. Appropriately enough a black female dressed as Cat Woman flees from the accident. After Halle hits her Megan's poor mom flies through the air and lands in her freshly dug grave.Meanwhile Megan enrolls in an inner city high school Musical High School. She meets Thomas Damon Wayans Jr. and they become an item. Megan has shunned dancing since her mom's death. Eventually Thomas persuades her to take up hiphop dancing. Later on their first big date Thomas takes her to the ballet. Megan is shocked. The ballet recreates the events that culminated in her mom's death involving a stalled gasoline tanker truck along with those reckless celebrity drivers with vanity tags.Aside from Thomas Megan meets a variety of oddballs at Musical High. The first day at lunch in the cafeteria the entire student body improvises the song  dance routine from the movie Fame where everybody plays a musical instrument including a blind kid named Ray George Gore II who displays his piano skills. The Fame lyrics has been changed to something considerably more salacious as well as silly. Megan's ghetto hall locker neighbor is Charity Essence Atkins of How High and Charity hauls her infant son to school everyday and hangs him in her locker while she attends classes. Charity's brother turns out to be none other than Thomas. In another Save the Last Dance scene Charity reprimands Megan for her interracial romance with Thomas because AfricanAmerican gals are running out of their own race to date.Imagine the usual lineup of characters in teen dance musicals. Each has a counterpart in Dance Flick right down to the pairing an obese Hairspray type girl and her dream boy jock who would rather play Juliet in Romeo  Juliet than dribble for his father's high school basketball team. Megan gapes when she meets her dance class instructor Ms. Camelto Amy Sedaris of Bewitched who lives up to her descriptive surname. Meanwhile Thomas and his main man ACon Affion Crockett of Soul Men have their own troubles. ACon is a street hoodlum with no ambition but Thomas aspires to be a gynecologist. Thomas dreams of attending Jus Community College. They have a dance crew that participates regularly in street dance competitions. They have lost 5thousand during their last street dance contest. Now they owe the five grand to a local gangsta Sugar Bear David Allen Grier of An American Carol and he demands his dough. Sugar Bear resembles Jabba the Hutt of Star Wars and cannot consume enough candy pies and sugary treats.Primarily director Damien Wayans has taken Save the Last Dance and crossed it with Step Up 2 The Streets adding characters from other movies like Hairspray Ray and Fame. For instance an obese girl like Tracy from Hairspray attends the school and the basketball coach has a son who resembles Zac Efron from High School Musical. Grier is riotous in an obvious fat suit as a Sugar Bear and Chris Elliott plays Megan's sordid lowlife father. Naturally the entire Wayans clan gets in on the action. Shawn plays Charity's baby's daddy. Shawn has several amusing scenes. Marlon is the most outrageous as an idiotic drama teacher who has made only one movie. He played a slave in a Mandingo plantation movie where he cut his leg off. Keenen Ivory plays a street dance promoter Mr. Stache with the whitest fake teeth you've ever seen.The Wayans have been masters at politically incorrect parodies since their FoxTV series In Living Color and they ridicule stereotypes mercilessly here for maximum merriment. They rag straight people gay people black people white people and drunken celebrities. When ACon tells Thomas that he cannot become a doctor because he has guns for hands he displays his gun hands and calls himself Edward Triggerfingers after the Johnny Depp movie Edward Scissorhands. Altogether Dance Flick is a comic cakewalk!".

We wait and wait and yet there is no one coming into this movie right there was my first hint that this movie would boom out. Now the movie starts and the first about 5 seconds seem OK then it's right back to the same humor as scary movie and little man. I was so disappointed I walked out of this movie after the little miss sunshine rip off And I have only ever walked out of one movie before and that was the first Hulk movie. I was honestly so sick of this movie after 20 minutes it was just one bad joke after the other no thought no planning and half the jokes seemed about 2 years old. This movie is nothing but yet another dark stain on movie making. Don't see this movie and if I could I would rate it maybe a  star.".

Outrage is the start of his second Yakuza trilogy Outrage 2 has been announced for next year and plays out on a Shakespearean stage with the epic quality of Dostoyevsky. Unlike his first trilogy Violent Cop Boiling Point and Sonatine this movie focuses on the politics of the yakuza rather than an intimate portrait of a compromised individual.There are random acts of extreme violence that continue to propel the plot forward. Kitano playing the underboss Otomo is a similar role to his other characters in yakuza movies which portray out of control individuals that have a minor standing yet have the last word at the end of the play. Rather than focusing on the beauty of mobsters hiding out on the beach this is a gritty urban drama much in the tradition of Johnnie To's triad movies Election that has dominated the organized crime dramas over the past decade.In showing the criminality of the human mind it evokes Mario Bava's study in Rabid Dogs similarly Kitano is building a Brechtian inspired drama about the harsh existential life. Kitano continues to explain and further define his worldview through the character of a doomed nihilist antihero. In all of Kitano's yakuza character studies there is no hope or redemption only a further plunge into an ugly existence of lies and deceit where only an act of violence can bring about change.As Kitano remarked publicly about his making of Outrage he is giving the people what they want  no pretense of artistic embellishments but rather blunt cruel acts of violence of the professional criminal devoid of any romanticism. One scene in particular evokes The Godfather but that is where the similarities end  there is nothing glamorous about the yakuza lifestyle.In this film Kitano assumes the duties as in his other yakuza films as that of star director editor and writer. The vision is completely his own. The pacing is deliberately slow showing that the life of a criminal is not particularly exciting but rather mundane as that of any other type of businessman mostly involving allegiances of convenience and acts of betrayal. There is no illumination or redemption here no course of action will lead to a better life such is the basic tenet of a nihilist.There is little flourish in the direction such as to immerse the viewer into the dark banal existence of its characters. The one scene that brings a sense of relief with sunlight streaming through the trees on a backstreet is colored darkly by seemingly innocent activity that is actually quite sinister for the individuals involved.This is a welcome and long overdue return for Kitano to the yakuza genre which he abandoned a decade ago for a trilogy of felliniesque introspective autobiographical films. There are no experimental sequences or absurdist imagery as in his previous films. As a consequence Kitano is no longer held back with meditative musings instead giving the viewer an unfiltered take on the corruption lies and phony existence of the individual in an artificial society  that any person in any social situation is merely part of an inauthentic social contract.In many ways the lack of artistic pretense in Outrage only serves to further embolden the bleak message that Kitano has for us. This is not a film for the weak of heart nor is it one for the impatient it is a slow revelation revealing the emptiness of life and the pointlessness of all action.".

	schema:reviewBody "Outrage is the film that many fans of director Kitano Takeshi and no doubt his investors have been clamoring for ever since he embarked on his arthouse odyssey with 2002's Dolls. The ensuing years' films ranged from introspective Takeshis to wacky Kantoku Banzai! and brought him critical acclaim but not much success at the box office. Outrage is clearly designed to please fans of Takeshi's earlier films such as Sonatine or Violent Cop hardboiled gangster films taking places in the shadowy world of Japan's yakuza.The plot revolves around an internal power struggle within an established yakuza family a fairly standard trope in gangster films in the East and West. Building on this frame Takeshi piles on a number of events the sequence characterized by the sort of surreally disconnected quality that I associate with his films. It's difficult to follow causality from one event to the next and in many cases they seem to operate as interesting vignettes loosely connected through the overarching plot. Some are blackly humorous some are brutally violent most are characterized by lots of yelling and cursing in the sort of coarse Japanese that's really difficult for nonnative speakers to get. Luckily the plot is simple enough to follow but I do wonder about missing out on some of the finer details...The characters are filled out only in broad strokes and most of the standard types are represented the godfatherlike boss the loyal lieutenant the conniving underling the dundering muscle and so on. Takeshi gets generally excellent performances out of the cast who manage to come off as sincere and spontaneous. He mentioned in a recent television interview that he shoots most of his scenes in only one or two takes and the film feels fresh. There's some very good talent here mostly genre actors but good ones. You develop sympathy for a lot of them by the film's end which is a mark in its favor.One of the things I really enjoyed about the film was Takeshi's camerawork which remains sharp and eyepleasing as ever. He makes effective use of wideangle closeups and does some great riffs off of Coppola in several scenes. Long pans and still shots are also used well. One that really sticks out in my memory from the beginning of the film is a low outside shot of a line of black cars just the rear quarter panels lined up one after the other traveling down the road. It's an odd shot but serenely beautiful and effective at conveying a sense of the power and menace of the men inside.On the minus side the plot really is simplistic and predictable. Not to the extent of boredom but once you understand the setup it's not at all hard to imagine how things are bound to turn out. Also I thought the film felt on the whole a bit too clean. The cars in every scene are immaculately polished every actor is decked out in a neatly arranged designer suit and every set has all of its props in a neatly prescribed arrangement. It presents a somewhat dystopic but ultimately whitewashed view of yakuza society that would feel retrograde in a Western gangster film.Overall it's nice to see a new yakuza film come out of Takeshi's shop hallmarked with the same sort of black humor extreme violence and artistic flair that we've come to expect from this perennial festival honoree. I would however have liked to see a bit more of how his intervening films might have affected this genre. Outrage is a good yakuza film but doesn't do much enough? to step outside of its element.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Outrage";
	schema:reviewBody "As far as I can remember the first Takeshi Kitano film that I saw him in was a Yakuza one called Brother where his character got to get to the United States while on the run from Japan and showed his relative a thing or two about running a racket and setting up shop in a foreign land. Between then and now there were the offbeat support roles in mainstream films to arthouse fare and now I've gone full circle with Kitano's latest Jpaanese film Outrage which made it to Cannes telling a story none other than one involving Japanese gangsters.But this is not your ordinary romanticized tale of gangsters where there's an identifiable lead who'd probably be that antihero or villain with the heart of gold. Outrage is an intense look at the structure of the Japanese yakuza where there is proper hierarchy in terms of funding promotions and the likes and how things are run in that secret society. It's almost like a corporation with a CEO in place with various houses reporting back to him each having a report card to score and the weak ones taken out from the organization in brutal fashion of course.Written directed and edited by Takeshi Kitano this is one film that tells you straight in the face that these are all bad men with zero humanity nor any room for redemption as they lead their corrupt lives very much looking over their shoulders choosing to go onto the path of obvious hypocrisy where loyalties are flimsy and count for nothing and are only as good as what you can bring and contribute to the coffers. Which is an interesting notion as you see orders no matter how absurd they sound being followed to a T and some of the best scenes involve contemplation of what's morally ethical ok even for a bit when told to betray another and this not only involves the hoodlums but those who are on the side to enforce the law being no better themselves.And the catalyst for everything that unfolds in the film gets sparked off by something as menial as an exploitation of a seemingly harmless man in a karaoke bar turned wrong which in essence is something hatched by the those in the lower rung of the structure because the head honcho disapproves of certain relationships being linked with the larger family alliance. Yes those at the bottom of the food chain gets to do all the dirty work. From then the narrative moves at a frantic pace as things get to spiral out of control and taking on a life of its own with everything from the gangsters' arsenal of weapons like bribery assassinations and blackmail being deployed in a systematic execution of foes from each side. The violence on display doesn't flinch which sort of provides you that cautionary hint that crime doesn't pay and that doesn't just mean the mutilation of the pinky is enough in ritual apologies. Kitano's story serves up execution after execution that will make the sternest of hearts cower at the way they are carried out without remorse even though you clearly know they are evil guys who deserve as good as the punishment and death they dish out themselves. You'd get plenty of bloody good gore thrown in for good measure without the camera cutting away which splatters the film with plenty of crimson red. In some ways it plays out like poetic justice especially when accompanied by the really magnificent soundtrack by Keiichi Suzuki.Outrage is outrageously recommended for those who'd like to sit on the sidelines and observe how people destroy other people in society through the lack of ethics especially when this film mirrors human nature in general with the plotting of usurping other's position of power any moment of selfadvancement through the stepping on other's backs. Only that here when it involves turf money and promotion to get to the very top amongst a group of armed men with little morals it comes with many body bags as well. Definitely one of the best Yakuza films in recent years for its stunningly brutal and refreshing portrayal of violent men in violent form.".

	onyx:emotionText "As far as I can remember the first Takeshi Kitano film that I saw him in was a Yakuza one called Brother where his character got to get to the United States while on the run from Japan and showed his relative a thing or two about running a racket and setting up shop in a foreign land. Between then and now there were the offbeat support roles in mainstream films to arthouse fare and now I've gone full circle with Kitano's latest Jpaanese film Outrage which made it to Cannes telling a story none other than one involving Japanese gangsters.But this is not your ordinary romanticized tale of gangsters where there's an identifiable lead who'd probably be that antihero or villain with the heart of gold. Outrage is an intense look at the structure of the Japanese yakuza where there is proper hierarchy in terms of funding promotions and the likes and how things are run in that secret society. It's almost like a corporation with a CEO in place with various houses reporting back to him each having a report card to score and the weak ones taken out from the organization in brutal fashion of course.Written directed and edited by Takeshi Kitano this is one film that tells you straight in the face that these are all bad men with zero humanity nor any room for redemption as they lead their corrupt lives very much looking over their shoulders choosing to go onto the path of obvious hypocrisy where loyalties are flimsy and count for nothing and are only as good as what you can bring and contribute to the coffers. Which is an interesting notion as you see orders no matter how absurd they sound being followed to a T and some of the best scenes involve contemplation of what's morally ethical ok even for a bit when told to betray another and this not only involves the hoodlums but those who are on the side to enforce the law being no better themselves.And the catalyst for everything that unfolds in the film gets sparked off by something as menial as an exploitation of a seemingly harmless man in a karaoke bar turned wrong which in essence is something hatched by the those in the lower rung of the structure because the head honcho disapproves of certain relationships being linked with the larger family alliance. Yes those at the bottom of the food chain gets to do all the dirty work. From then the narrative moves at a frantic pace as things get to spiral out of control and taking on a life of its own with everything from the gangsters' arsenal of weapons like bribery assassinations and blackmail being deployed in a systematic execution of foes from each side. The violence on display doesn't flinch which sort of provides you that cautionary hint that crime doesn't pay and that doesn't just mean the mutilation of the pinky is enough in ritual apologies. Kitano's story serves up execution after execution that will make the sternest of hearts cower at the way they are carried out without remorse even though you clearly know they are evil guys who deserve as good as the punishment and death they dish out themselves. You'd get plenty of bloody good gore thrown in for good measure without the camera cutting away which splatters the film with plenty of crimson red.

My favourite scene of the movie is in that noodle shop where a random customer will find something floating in his bowl of noodles . If u wanna see a really cool and awesome yakuza movie this should be it. I can not wait for the second part of this movie. It's suppose to come out anytime in 2012.

The Sanno family  who destroyed tomo's family  has become too powerful and the oldguard members felt that the young leaders are risking the whole business because of their extreme greed . One wrong move and it's all out war .The great Japanese director Beat Takeshi returns to the big screen with Outrage dealing with a genre that gave him international recognition and made him one of the best Asian filmmakers  and being Takeshi Kitano's first gangster film in ten years  after Brother 2000 . It is an exciting picture displaying suspense  tension  and interesting gangsters war  though sometimes difficult to follow . There is also a cruel depiction of Yakuza life in the 21st century . The story opens with a striking wide shot of a large group of gangsters dressed in black as their leaders meet  these guys have sworn allegiance to their bosses but it means little once the bullets start flying . Cold and violent film with a confuse plot  twisted intrigue  grisly killings  thrills  chilling events and colorful images . His stunning long takes can resemble intricate paintings while his characters enjoy little respite from the ruthlessness of the real world . However  it results to be a little bit boring  including with no sense dialogs and some embarrassing situations adding brutal murders . Following a string of unconventional  commercially unappealing films Takeshi Kitano engineered this film specifically as commercially appealing going back to the genre which brought him the most success and going as far as imagining the death scenes first and writing a story around them later .The motion picture was professionally directed by Takeshi Kitano in his peculiar style  being his first film shot in 2.351 format . Since his 1989 directorial debut Kitano has written directed edited or starred in almost a film per year without losing the momentum of his originality and heightened artistic sensibility. The extraordinary success of 1997's Hana Bi confirmed Kitano's place as a leading figure of international cinema  here offered remarkable visions of violence and beauty . Among its numerous awards Hanabi or Fireworks won Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion and was named Best NonEuropean Film by the European Film Academy . In 2000 Kitano made Brother 2000 his first film shot outside of Japan. Originally a comedy star on Japanese television Takeshi Kitano  aka Beat Takeshi  rose to international fame as a director of Yakuza dramas during the 1990s . Brother like other Kitanodirected films such as his debut Violent Cop  Boiling Point 1990 and Sonatine 1993 centered around Yakuza gangster characters. The filmmaker contrasted the violence and action of those films with comedy or tenderness in films like Ano Natsu Ichiban Shizukana Umi 1991 US title A Scene at the Sea MinnYatteruka! 1994 US title Getting Any? Kizzu ritn 1996 US title Kids Return and Kikujiro 1999. For the first time in six years Kitano remained strictly behind the camera on Dolls 2002 his tenth film as a writerdirector . His last film is this Outrage that most closely resembles 2000's Brother in tone but it outdoes that picture by remaining unpredictable with constant betrayals  getting a considerable success .".

As in 'Sonatine' Kitano plays an underunder boss in the Japanese mafia hierarchy who falls victim to the plotting of the bigger fish in the pond. Not unlike 'Sonatine' the situation turns from bad to worse and Kitano soon faces the inevitable faith of an yakuza. Not without a fight though. But where 'Sonatine' contained so much more than the realistic outburst of ultraviolence the only new dish that Outrage brings to the table are some plump racist jokes every time an African corrupt of course! ambassador is depicted in the movie. It tastes like bad sushi. 'Outrage' contains nothing of the heartfelt intimacy taking place in 'Fireworks' Hanabi between Kitano's police officer and his dying wife or the sublimely comedic scenes in Sonatine like the ultrarapid sumo match on the beach or fireworks battle. Contrary to the previous two movies or 'Kikujiro' you're left feeling very little sympathy for Otomo the antihero of Outrage. For the first time the usual eye of the storm the stoic face of Kitano fails to communicate any feelings across screen. Sadly we're still left waiting for Kitano's return to the uniquely poetic funny and thoughtful yakuza movies that made him beloved all over the world. In the meantime you should watch the old movies instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "What comes to your mind when one mentions Yakuza? Is it something bleak and dark? That's apparently what's delivered through this Takeshi Kitano film.Typically the topic of yakuza is often shunned. If ever confronted it is often used to accentuate comedic elements whilst leaving the truth of the yakuza world unchallenged. However directorscreenwriteractor Takeshi Kitano goes against the flow and makes a comeback with this feature film after almost a decade long hiatus. Though this is not as well received as compared to other made in Japan films it has still received much acclamation. Earlier in his directing career he was already known for Violent Cop and Sonatine which also dealt with the dark world of yakuza. It is therefore admirable for his efforts to bring forth the most truthful reflection of the dark side of Japan despite the risk of low commercial success. And for this film he has once again managed to project a somewhat accurate image of the realities in the yakuza scene.The overarching plot of the film works with the conflicts that could possibly exist in any relationships  malice and greed. It circles the power struggle between the Iketomogumi and its affliation Murasegumi and his sworn brother Otomo Takeshi Kitano who has his own crew as well. While Otomo tries to break free from the subordination of the Murasegumi they too try to acquire greater power. In this power struggle they begin to plot against one another and result in sheer violence and torture. In this aspect Takeshi is quite creative and playful as he invents numerous ways that the characters get tortured or die. As revealed in one of his interviews he actually came up with these before he wrote the narrative that parallels with the violence. The convincing gore and neverimagined ways to kill and torture for this you really have to watch it for yourself.Takeshi has carefully chosen who to cast for this film. He made a point not to repeat any actors who worked with him in his previous yakuza related works. The cast is pretty commendable for they capture the essence of the characters they are portraying and even are said to get through each scene with only one or two shots. One of the more outstanding actors is undeniably Ryo Kase who sports fluent English as opposed to the JaprishEngrish we often associate Japanese with. That being said the English dialogues between him and the gaijin foreigner were rather blunt and funny. This is probably intentionally designed to poke fun and entertain the viewers.In the technical aspect Takeshi displays much competence in his camera work. From wideangled shots to closeups to long pans and even point ofview shots he utilized a variety of these shots to effectively communicate the nonverbal messages. Put simply you will find it easier to 'get into the mood' as he engages the viewers very much. Also hallmark of his films is the seemingly abrupt cuts that often do not signal direct causality in the sequences. As the idiom goes one man's meat is another man's poison. You will either hate this style or love this style. Though it can get confusing at times the overarching plot sets a frame for which the sequences happen. Therefore in its fairly organized manner it sparks brilliance in its narrative.Overall the film though unconventional is a careful examination of the selfish desires that deteriorates relationships. Fitted into the yakuza context this message has an added punch. On a random note do look forward to the unanticipated twist towards the end! www.moviexclusive.com".

	schema:reviewBody "General opinion this is probably Beat Takeshi at his career's lowest. Story gangs kill each other with some wining and some losing yes that simple. The entire story is based on shock value and you will feel numb after 30 minutes because it gets tiring. Acting everybody is seriously twisted which makes for a very bland mix just imagine a song that only has high notes. Music what music? Gore OK this is where the movie actually got me to vote this 5 and there's enough nude stuff to keep you watching for more. But if a Takeshi movie is using goresex to lure viewers that is just cheap! Overall repeat this is Beat at his lowest form. This movie is nothing like Violent cop Battle Royale Brother Zatoichi etc ... where he actually made some effort making them. I am a solid Takeshi fan but on this one I was so angry that I actually spent 2 hours watching this while yes 13 assassins is a much better movie.".

All the films were very nihilisticwith lots of violence betrayal and yakuza assassinations. And as usual Kitano is completely emotionless as he kills in the most difficult to watch manner. Had this film introduced anything new I would have given it a higher score.The film is about betrayals. A mob boss orchestrates fights between various yakuza families. And in turn once these battles are complete he then pit the winners against other gang members. It's all very ugly but well made...but nothing more...and unpleasant.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a big fan of Asian action films especially Hong Kong shoot 'em uppers and Thai martial arts flicks but for some reason I can never follow what is happening in some Janpanese films especially in Takeshi Kitano's films. I'm always left confused about who is who and why things are happening and what the story is even about.I really don't like American remakes of foreign films and think it's just a waste of money to have reshot The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo in English for example when the original could have simply been given wider distribution. But in the case of Outrage I do hope it gets remade because for some reason as it is the story just doesn't translate well with me. It was the same for me with Infernal Affairs I thought The Departed was a much better film and I understood what was going on a lot more.I know there is some subtle humorous force at play in Outrage sort of like Clint Eastwood playing the gangs against each other in A Fistful Of Dollars but sorry I don't know why the cook gets a set of chopsticks jammed into his ear don't know why one of the bosses gets his mouth chewed up with a dental instrument have no idea who it is that is getting his neck tied to a pole and then gets ripped out of a moving car but more importantly why all of this is happening.I sort of understand that the big boss wants to pit the two families against each other but I still don't understand why or what that accomplishes or who is the guy in the very last scene who is called an ahole. And I have found this confusion to be the case with all the Takeshi Kitano movies that I have seen.It's not that I can't follow subtitles. I'm a huge fan of John Woo and can follow his films just fine. It's just that the moody arty deadpan Kitano style just doesn't translate well for me and for some reason I can't distinguish between characters which is really annoying when a film is shot in choppy short scenes where if you aren't immediately clear about who is who stuff happens fast and is gone within seconds. So as you can see I'm not that big of a fan of Takeshi Kitano.".

Hence my 710 rating.The movie revolves around the plot by the Machiavellian chairman of the Yakuza sorta like the Don of the mafia. He plays off the different families against each other and plays off the sub families sub clans and their underbosses against the main family clans. It shows how the Don maintain and attained his power and how loyalty is merely a facade used for control.The acting is good with Takeshi's trademark use of minimal dialogue and quick brutal violence the comedic element and ending. unfortunately the same ending we have seen again and again.Still a good movie but IMO its a movie we have seen countless time from Beat Takeshi.".

Head of Organization Sekiuchi Soichiro Kitamura is dissatisfied with the closeness of his assistant chief Ikemoto Jun Kunimura with rival clan of Murase Renji Ishibashi. Since Ikemoto's clan made a brotherly agreement with Murase's clan he engages Otomo Takeshi Kitano to create a conflict that will eliminate doubts of Sekuichi. Otomo is the head of the family subordinated to Ikemoto but delegated task to rough Murase gang members up a bit takes overzealously. This act will ignite bloody spiral of inevitable revenge sadistic violence and dirty power struggle between the clans with the head of the organization in the heart of the conflict...The versatile Japanese director Takeshi Kitano has built a worldwide reputation in the nineties recording impressive auteur films about the yakuzas.

The only element that saves the movie from its classification in the exploitation genre is the intelligent use of black humor to the extent that the movie is at times transformed into a comic farce and even unintentional slapstick especially when the character of African diplomat is in the focus.Takeshi Kitano has returned to the genre of yakuza movies after ten years but without any artistic pretensions. Outrage is a dynamic movie showing successive executions sometimes garnished with black humor which can provide greater commercial success but also bring disappointment to many of director fans. New Kitano movie is oneadrenaline entertainment and nothing more unfortunately.".

Head of Organization Sekiuchi Soichiro Kitamura is dissatisfied with the closeness of his assistant chief Ikemoto Jun Kunimura with rival clan of Murase Renji Ishibashi. Since Ikemoto's clan made a brotherly agreement with Murase's clan he engages Otomo Takeshi Kitano to create a conflict that will eliminate doubts of Sekuichi. Otomo is the head of the family subordinated to Ikemoto but delegated task to rough Murase gang members up a bit takes overzealously. This act will ignite bloody spiral of inevitable revenge sadistic violence and dirty power struggle between the clans with the head of the organization in the heart of the conflict...The versatile Japanese director Takeshi Kitano has built a worldwide reputation in the nineties recording impressive auteur films about the yakuzas. After he shot the film Brother 2000 he left the genre inspired by the Japanese underworld and devoted himself to film work on a series of artdrama exploring the theme of intimate and spiritual significance.

Violent and sadistic yes but in a more stylistic manner with no excess and outrageous brutality as we saw three decades ago. But this film is also different from the ordinary Kitano's yakuza material. Because there is here ABSOLUTELY no emotion at all. I remember his previous features such as SONATINE HANA BI and especially BROTHER  I don't have VIOLENT COP clear in my memory  and in those films I felt really something poignant in the stories and characters. Characters whom you could feel empathy for.But in this one no Sir. The usual 2000's yakuza stuff perhaps without the eccentricity of a Mike Takashii. A brutal sharp and cold yakuza crime film about dog fights to get to the top of the underworld.And I think there was more sequences with guys shots by the bullets than in the other Beat Takeshi's films...In BROTHER for instance he only suggested. And this was a very brutal flick in the same time. But with a kind of poetry that we did not find here.Another style.".

	schema:reviewBody "The crime drama is usually one of the top genres of all time according to many film lovers out there since it brings the best of both worlds and realities one of which we only know through the news medias and sometimes through life when we become part of it usually the worst side as victims or worse as actual part of it  not me and hopefully not you and the dramatic aspects of it all when the characters face dilemmas decisions and all sorts of problems. Outrage seemed to have all those elements combined but it failed to generate enough interest halfway through with its plot emptiness lack of a higher purpose which criminal films tend to have and some errors on the way. Takeshi Kitano's film is a huge disappointment worthy of praise due to its cold reality presentation in the luminous violent sequences which puts to shame many Hollywood films in recent years. But a movie doesn't and cannot survive with just those moments.Most of the time I like to present the movie to the readers explain plot points and what's it all about. With Outrage I simply can't do that. Not because I was lost in trying to figure out who was who and what was their position in the crime syndicate presented here but it's due to confusion in seeing what was the major goal and gain the bosses had with their crime wave which permeates the film. The people on the top of the pyramid didn't have a visible cause for all the killings that came. Stay at the top of the game and be the only source of guns and drugs in the whole place eliminating competition at the same time when they were eliminating people from their own family...whatever the film didn't work since they overlook and fail to present their actual line of work. There's changes of leadership brutal murders but it's hard to understand why they're doing what they do. I refer this to the leaders not necessarily the henchmen or the minor individuals. Example when one of top figure is lured into a Yakuza bar without knowing the folks behind it and he's forced to pay a ridiculously high bill I can get that specially the outcome that develops later. But most of the time the leaders orders were contradictory ineffective and we were never able to see the exact difference between groups their business deal except when they were killing each other and cutting their pinky fingers to pay due for some offense.Through most of the ordeal in watching Outrage all I kept thinking was that the murderdeath sequences were amazingly done  the dentist torture scene managed to erase my Marathon Man trauma it was a lot worse  and like where's the great dialogues the spectacular dramatic moments? It went on and on without much gain for me. Around the same week I saw Gommora which was also an entry at the Cannes Film Festival different years however a multilayered hyperlink film about crime society in Italy and despite some confusing aspects and problems with its structure I find it a better film than Outrage. You could understand how the system worked why people were killing each other selling arms stealing it doing drugs or selling toxic waste...that criminal pyramid was real and even the actionsuspense sequences were amazing. With Outrage I couldn't like much of anything. It was dry empty lacking in purpose and lacking in art and entertainment values. And I won't even bother mentioning the plot holes that appeared along the way.I'm amazed that there were sequels to this thing which I'll pass. I was starving for a higher purpose throughout the picture and was left hungry for more. Not a good sign so you can easily skip it. You won't miss much. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "What are some words out there to describe the evil Japanese clan Yakuza? It comes down to brutality unforgiving relentless and an absolute pledge. Fortunately The Outrage directed by Takeshi Kitano who is famous for Battle Royal manages to tell the cruel side of Yakuza world where a verbal conflict leads to spattering blood until the strongest wins. To summarize the plot the two different crime organizations owned by an affluent Sanmokai chairman get into a vicious quarrel as each subordinate gets killed one by one from backtoback retaliation. As they are inclined to execute everything they are told by their higherups under any occasion the story gets deeper and intense.We also get to see all types of violence for the punishment and vengeance. One of the traditional ways of making it up for one's miscue is to slice one of their fingers. There is zero mercy and sympathy.To talk about some downsides As the justice being the symbol of the police a lieutenant forms an alliance with the Yakuza chairman by getting a bribe. There is no need to reprimand the director portraying an unlawful decorum of police here. But the real disappointment lies on the incompetent power of a legislative body that faces against Yakuza being onesided as they easily makes a mockery of the police.For example there is a scene where a luxury car with a corpse in the trunk tries to pass through an inspection gate which is heavily guarded by more than three officers. And one of the subordinates Ishihara who is fluent in English pretends be a foreigner who does not understand a word of Japanese so the officer just meekly lets them pass despite discovering blood dripping from the trunk. That is not all. The officer getting rejected for frisking the trunk because they state that it belongs to an embassy! It neglects the duty and proprietary of the police whose jobs are to identify any suspects.Not only that while a number of Yakuza members getting killed in public the police does not even try to arrest a single member because of inadequate evidence! All I see is the same lieutenant taking a bribe and yelling at the alleged Yakuza You did it right? Don't lie to me! whilst the rest of his comrades being dormant. Can't the director bother to make an even one scene where forensics examining fingerprints?Even it is an intention of director to show corrupted side of Japanese police I still think they should implement detailed investigation scenes where police and Yakuza congregate.Other than that the story itself delivers well. The lesson in this movie would be human beings have the effrontery to betray anyone in order to fulfill their own goal at least in Yakuza world. Sadly the world we are living in may not be as hopeful as we think yet.".

Their intimate relationship will test your own beliefs on age and race. But by the time you figure out where you stand another scene will give you reason to pause and think.

There were some sex scenes that will probably go because some people in this country can't handle it but nothing that I felt was gratuitous or just sex for the sake of showing some nudity. Some may also find the violence objectionable but nothing close to SinCity or any war movie ever made. I hope the film does well and the public enjoys it. Who cares what the industry has to say.

Some may also find the violence objectionable but nothing close to SinCity or any war movie ever made. I hope the film does well and the public enjoys it. Who cares what the industry has to say. They promote absolute garbage with a full wallet all the time. Check this one out and form an opinion for yourself.";

I prefer to believe they only exist in screenwriters minds. Mirren is her usual superb self and Gooding shows he really can act. The question is were they in love or was he simply controlled by her.

I liked that the story's timeline was longer than just about any kind of crime thriller you'd see these days.This is definitely not a popcorn movie and you will find yourself shocked at the violence and then moved by the touching scenes. Nothing is exploitive or gratuitous in this film. The grisly violence intense sexuality and touching interdependence of the characters serve to underscore just how absurdly varying a life or lives can be.I think sometimes moviegoers expect too much from film. Not every movie is A Streetcar Named Desire. There were important fundamental themes in this movie  love lust loyalty guilt shame... all brilliantly conveyed by the actors.

This is a difficult point to grasp. I wasn't offended or anything I just think it looks like he is using this as a crutch instead of art. It comes across as trying to hard to be edgy. It basically loses its impact. 2. Boring Story. So ridiculously predictable. Its really a shame given the great acting and interesting characters. Total fizzle at the end though. 3.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was pretentious and mediocre at best. I liked the performances by Cuba Gooding Jr. and Helen Mirren and a decent job by Vanessa Ferlito who I found difficult to enjoy when she appeared in season 3 of 24. But the direction and cinematography were cloying and manipulative. There were all these hazy diffused slowmotion images of leaves falling and sun glinting and naked bodies rolling around in bed or on the ground. I think the director is one of many contemporary pedestrian filmmakers whose only means of depicting emotion is a closeup of an actor emoting and whose only means for showing intimacy between actors is a sex scene. Eventually though even though I admired Gooding's performance I got tired of seeing the softfocused beefcake photography of his naked or seminaked body.And the writing fairly sucked too. Not only was this yet another movie about an aging dying assassin questioning hisher moral status and the existence of God but the movie constantly brought up plot points and character conflicts that it seemingly had no interest in. What exactly is Gooding's relationship with Mirren? Who is the Gooding character? Is he anything other than a weird incestuous loversonboytoy and business associate of Mirren's? There were other points that needed exploring as well but the movie seemed to have no problem forgetting them so I've already forgotten them as well. And there were other things too like elements of the story that were purely for the sake of narrative convenience. Like the entire character played by Stephen Dorff. I keep looking forward to the day when we get fedup with movies that must establish early on that their villains are irredeemably evil sadists who deserve any horrible fate that awaits them in the final reel. But Daniels apparently doesn't think we've gotten to that point yet. Another unexplained narrative convenience is the 56 years that pass in an instant so that the child in the movie is suddenly about 78 years old. I think the only reason for this is so that the kid is old enough to use a gun well enough to emerge as the filius ex machina at the end of the movie. Meanwhile every other character conflict and relationship in the movie is in suspended animation while the kid gets old enough to be the budding little button man that he eventually becomes.I guess that's one of my gripes. I think this could have been a better movie still derivative but stronger if it had allowed Gooding's character to be the main character in the movie. But instead of revealing his character all Daniels managed to do was to reveal was his stony face rockhard biceps and trim buttocks. I didn't get anything close to a satisfying glimpse of what made him who he was other than the clichd childhood traumas concerning his hitman father. But even if that was the anchor issue in his life the movie doesn't reveal Gooding working through it or even the extent to which it matters to him. Apparently the movie thinks this poppsych backstory is important since the movie ends with Gooding's life echoing in that of surrogate son but since I never quite know what Gooding's childhood meant to him I don't really care about what it might mean to the monstrous little Anthony who has magically learned to kill and be fine with it.My sense is that in this film's rush to be important it missed every opportunity to be important whatever that means as well as the chance just to be entertaining. It could have focused fruitfully on either Mirren's character or Gooding's but instead it flitted from Mirren to Dorff to Gooding to the doctor and Mo'Nique etc. I'm curious to see what happens when this movie gets out into the world apparently in June. I can't imagine it being a wide release but in the art house circuit it will compare very unfavorably to movies that are better directed and better written.".

Though it can be highly sexual violent stylized and filled with some baroque plot twists it has a goforbroke ingenuousness that makes it all work. It reminds me of Sweet Sweetback's Badaaass Song in the way it plays to what the director knows is a pulpy inner city aesthetic but that it is of his world one filled with violence and unsavory characters. No one here is entirely sympathetic. It defies the stereotypes of more traditional formula driven films. There's no comforting message. Combine all this with his love for films like Sweet Charity and you have an odd film.Daniels confidence in his own vision certainly applies to his notable casting choices that distinguish his films. He is a great director of actors and makes sure that they understand his own background and reasons for employing certain character types and situations. In Shadowboxer Macy Grey is not only credible but terrific as was Mariah Carey in Precious. He gets an understated performance from Cuba Gooding Jr. which alone is a worthy achievement. Helen Mirren deserves accolades for not just being the great actress one expects but for maintaining needed integrity in what must have seemed a risky venture. She anchors the story beautifully in what are to say the least some bizarre situations. The casting of Mo'nique as lover to Joseph GordonLevitt is also wonderful. And Stephen Dorff's full frontal Trojan and all is on for the records. In fact Lee Daniels general obsession with male beauty and asses is a theme in itself. Hello Gus Van Zant! I suppose in the wrong mood you could find the movie just over the top. Even though it's far a perfect film it is great fun and shows Lee Daniels as a director of force and confidence.".

	schema:reviewBody "Contract assassin Rose is diagnosed with cancer and along with her stepson  lover Mikey she decides their next assignment will be her last. Their job is to kill a gangster's wife but Rose doesn't go through with it as she finds out she's pregnant even though Mikey doesn't agree with her idea to hide her away. He goes through with it anyhow because of the happiness it brings to Rose. Time passes by and Mikey is still doing his coldhearted hits but also he has become a father figure to the young boy. Nice to look at but it's all style and very little substance which populates William Lipz's messy screenplay and encourages slick direction from Lee Daniels. With that in mind and its hip intentions it still feels cheap. It wants to be daring and hardcore within its artsy visuals but most of these moments feel forced and clumsy like the bafflingly kinky sex scenes and calculated mean streak of violence as it all becomes extremely bland in its shallow repetitiveness. The quirky vibe just doesn't mix with its spiteful air. The plot has so many little diverting stories which has too much coming and going that sidetracks from the central point and it leaves very little time to develop the characters and their situations. It seems be caught in two minds in how it wants to go and it's hard to get any sort of rhythm and genuine quality due to it. This is far from your usual assassin story and that's how it wants you to perceive it as. But when it wasn't concentrating on the hits it's pretty much doormat stuff. What added to that wonky stable was the superfluously stringent script which thinks it's importantly poetic and emotionally deep than it actually is. The chemistry between the cast does seem to be lacking and more so unconvincing. Some performances were fine but others weren't oh so great and Macy Grey was the main culprit with an tellingly embarrassing and cringeworthy performance. Oh it was painful. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays it coldly robotic but portrays his character's inner workings with simple expressions and the elegance of Helen Mirren adds class but still confuses. Stephen Doraff wasn't bad as the sleazy crackpot head gangster. His performance was one nasty piece of work. Vanessa Ferlito is stirringly sound and Joseph GordonLevitt adds a cool little spark to his doctor character. Daniels' deadpan direction formats compelling visuals and flashed up action scenes in a swiftly executed manner. However the stunning visual eye can be undone by monotone pacing where it can drag and labour on. And there's a strange fascination with showing ass. The musical score has whimsically harrowing touch that feels kinda like it's lifted from a TV movie and the digital shot photography is lyrically looping and smooth. The film is technically fine but the material is an unfocused jumble. Incoherently pretentious and clinically nasty but some interesting elements do arise and you can only say that it a was nice try.".

The imagery used throughout the film is very intense. I lived in Philadelphia and I must say that I have never seen it look that beautiful before. The film is a nice examination of interpersonal relationships and is an extremely effective thriller. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who likes intelligent thrillers with good action.

	schema:reviewBody "Shadowboxer 2005 Directed By Lee Daniels Starring Cuba Gooding Jr. Helen Mirren Stephen Dorff Vanessa Ferlito Joseph GordonLevitt Mo'Nique  Macy Gray MPAA Rating R for strong graphic violence and sexuality nudity language and some drug useEvery year at least one actress gives the definitive performance of her lifetime. It is the performance she will be remembered for forever. Last year we had Reese Witherspoon and Felicity Huffman in the two best female performances of the year. This year it was very obvious that it would Helen Mirren's year to rule. People everywhere were buzzing about her phenomenal performance and the Academy Award seemed like a definite. That performancewas not in Shadowboxer. It was in The Queen. Shadowboxer is the movie that Helen Mirren will look back on with shame. I really was looking forward to Shadowboxer. I'm a huge fan of Helen Mirren and Cuba Gooding Jr. has done enough work to more than prove that he is competent granted Boat Trip was enough to discredit anyone. I even must admit that I have always thought that Mo'Nique is a good actress with a horrible choice in movies and the same goes for Stephen Dorff hey at least he has done some good films in the past. Lee Daniel was a first time director but I was kind of excited to see a fresh face. He had already produced some phenomenal movies so I was thrilled to see what he would bring to the director's chair. So what went wrong? Ah well so many things just didn't work. This movie was a fullfledged disaster.This movie had a shockingly preposterous plot. It was awkward clumsilyexecuted and had me chuckling in disbelief this was not a good thing. What started as a bleak cheerless drama quickly descended into melodramatic schlock with a cheesy predictable ending. Rose Mirren and Mikey Gooding are two assassins who have been having an affair for quite some time. Mikey is also Rose's stepson I can't make this stuff up. She is also dying of cancer. When vicious crime lord Clayton Dorff hires Rose and Mikey to kill his supposedly unfaithful wife the two agree without much hesitationuntil Rose discovers that his wife Vickie Ferlito is pregnant. Unexpectedly emotional Rose cannot bring herself to kill the pregnant woman who just happens to go into labor as Rose arrives. Rose delivers the baby because you know every hired assassin is trained in delivering babies and along with Mikey takes Vickie and her child with them and the four begin a strange family if family is the correct terminology. That is until Clayton finds out what happened and comes after them. Did I also mention that there is a doctor named Dr. Don GordonLevitt who assists them and who is dating Precious Mo'Nique. This relationship is actually one of the most unnecessary and timeconsuming aspects of the movie. I didn't buy it for one second but I'll come back to that later. What could have been an intriguing plot with some tweaking turns into ninetythree minutes of painfullyobvious garbage.The performances in Shadowboxer are actually quite good all things considering. Helen Mirren is a fascinating actress. Watching her work is just an amazing experience every time and there is absolutely no difference here. She embraces the role and delivers the only character we can really care about. Cuba Gooding Jr. is also a good actorbut he has made mistake after mistake in choosing movie roles and Shadowboxer may very well be his biggest mistake yet. Granted his performance works the movie just gives him nothing interesting to do or say. He populates such a dull lifeless character that it bewilders me as to how he came off as credible as he did. Stephen Dorff another good actor in my opinion who really can't pick good moviesI mean really Alone in the Dark and FeardotCom! Here he embraces his inner villain and comes off as a genuinely vile man albeit clichd and stereotypical. He made me hate him so his performance worked. Vanessa Ferlito is endearing and sympathetic. I felt for her character and felt that she was really the only relatable character in the bunch. She did a fine job. She did a fine job. Mo'Niquewell well well she stars in yet another horrendous movie from 2006 technically this is a 2005 film but I am counting it as a 2006 because it was released in 2006. Again she does a nice job but no one is going to take her seriously if she doesn't start choosing roles that people actually care to see.I found myself disliking this movie so much that it surprised me. This movie is not as bad as such movies as Little Man and Larry the Cable Guy Health Inspector but it appears to be worse. Why? Because Little Man recognized the fact that it was not a good movie and was just ridiculous. Shadowboxer is so shockingly pretentious and selfloving that you can almost hear the filmmakers singing We are smart and wonderful! We will definitely win the Oscar! in the background. But this movie deserves nothing in terms of positive recognition. It deserves to be forgotten and dropped to the very bottom of the five dollar bin at WalMart right beside Little Man and Rest Stop and Phat Girlz. It is such a shame because it has a good cast and a promising fresh director. But in the end it doesn't matter how good a movie SHOULD have beenif the end product is nothing short of rubbish.Final Thought An overlyweird and downright awkward thriller with only one thing to offer good performances.Overall Rating 210 C".

I even must admit that I have always thought that Mo'Nique is a good actress with a horrible choice in movies and the same goes for Stephen Dorff hey at least he has done some good films in the past. Lee Daniel was a first time director but I was kind of excited to see a fresh face. He had already produced some phenomenal movies so I was thrilled to see what he would bring to the director's chair. So what went wrong? Ah well so many things just didn't work. This movie was a fullfledged disaster.This movie had a shockingly preposterous plot. It was awkward clumsilyexecuted and had me chuckling in disbelief this was not a good thing. What started as a bleak cheerless drama quickly descended into melodramatic schlock with a cheesy predictable ending. Rose Mirren and Mikey Gooding are two assassins who have been having an affair for quite some time. Mikey is also Rose's stepson I can't make this stuff up. She is also dying of cancer. When vicious crime lord Clayton Dorff hires Rose and Mikey to kill his supposedly unfaithful wife the two agree without much hesitationuntil Rose discovers that his wife Vickie Ferlito is pregnant. Unexpectedly emotional Rose cannot bring herself to kill the pregnant woman who just happens to go into labor as Rose arrives. Rose delivers the baby because you know every hired assassin is trained in delivering babies and along with Mikey takes Vickie and her child with them and the four begin a strange family if family is the correct terminology. That is until Clayton finds out what happened and comes after them. Did I also mention that there is a doctor named Dr. Don GordonLevitt who assists them and who is dating Precious Mo'Nique. This relationship is actually one of the most unnecessary and timeconsuming aspects of the movie. I didn't buy it for one second but I'll come back to that later. What could have been an intriguing plot with some tweaking turns into ninetythree minutes of painfullyobvious garbage.The performances in Shadowboxer are actually quite good all things considering. Helen Mirren is a fascinating actress. Watching her work is just an amazing experience every time and there is absolutely no difference here. She embraces the role and delivers the only character we can really care about. Cuba Gooding Jr. is also a good actorbut he has made mistake after mistake in choosing movie roles and Shadowboxer may very well be his biggest mistake yet. Granted his performance works the movie just gives him nothing interesting to do or say. He populates such a dull lifeless character that it bewilders me as to how he came off as credible as he did. Stephen Dorff another good actor in my opinion who really can't pick good moviesI mean really Alone in the Dark and FeardotCom! Here he embraces his inner villain and comes off as a genuinely vile man albeit clichd and stereotypical. He made me hate him so his performance worked. Vanessa Ferlito is endearing and sympathetic. I felt for her character and felt that she was really the only relatable character in the bunch. She did a fine job. She did a fine job. Mo'Niquewell well well she stars in yet another horrendous movie from 2006 technically this is a 2005 film but I am counting it as a 2006 because it was released in 2006. Again she does a nice job but no one is going to take her seriously if she doesn't start choosing roles that people actually care to see.I found myself disliking this movie so much that it surprised me. This movie is not as bad as such movies as Little Man and Larry the Cable Guy Health Inspector but it appears to be worse. Why? Because Little Man recognized the fact that it was not a good movie and was just ridiculous. Shadowboxer is so shockingly pretentious and selfloving that you can almost hear the filmmakers singing We are smart and wonderful! We will definitely win the Oscar! in the background. But this movie deserves nothing in terms of positive recognition. It deserves to be forgotten and dropped to the very bottom of the five dollar bin at WalMart right beside Little Man and Rest Stop and Phat Girlz. It is such a shame because it has a good cast and a promising fresh director. But in the end it doesn't matter how good a movie SHOULD have beenif the end product is nothing short of rubbish.Final Thought An overlyweird and downright awkward thriller with only one thing to offer good performances.Overall Rating 210 C";

	schema:reviewBody "Popular writer Ben Hecht certainly was no stranger to the Broadway cornucopia of gangsters molls hoofers  sharpies and mixes them all in a nonglamorous look at the Great White Way.Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in a bit of offbeat casting plays Bill O'Brien Broadway sharpie who thinks he's latched on to a sure thing in steering rube John Qualen into a fixed poker game. Qualen however is not a millionaire. Fairbanks has it all wrong Qualen doesn't have money he's embezzled 3000.00 from his employer and is thinking of suicide. Fairbanks ain't as sharp as he thinks but with the help of inebriated playwright Thomas Mitchell he tries to bluff his way through the gangsters and turn a profit.Always appealing to Fairbanks's better nature is Rita Hayworth who does a good job of arousing the noble and the carnal at the same time. She's not Queen of Columbia pictures yet just a crown princess. But Hayworth is just magnificent in this part.Thomas Mitchell is always given kudos for his part and they are deserved but one who's not talked about is John Qualen. Qualen had a fine run of character parts in his long career of little men constantly being victimized. He started that cycle with The Front Page and continues it on with Muley in The Grapes of Wrath and now this part in Angels Over Broadway. He was a fine but underrated actor and another favorite of John Ford.It's worth it just to see Rita Hayworth as always and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. with that New York City accent.".

	onyx:emotionText "Popular writer Ben Hecht certainly was no stranger to the Broadway cornucopia of gangsters molls hoofers  sharpies and mixes them all in a nonglamorous look at the Great White Way.Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in a bit of offbeat casting plays Bill O'Brien Broadway sharpie who thinks he's latched on to a sure thing in steering rube John Qualen into a fixed poker game. Qualen however is not a millionaire. Fairbanks has it all wrong Qualen doesn't have money he's embezzled 3000.00 from his employer and is thinking of suicide. Fairbanks ain't as sharp as he thinks but with the help of inebriated playwright Thomas Mitchell he tries to bluff his way through the gangsters and turn a profit.Always appealing to Fairbanks's better nature is Rita Hayworth who does a good job of arousing the noble and the carnal at the same time. She's not Queen of Columbia pictures yet just a crown princess. But Hayworth is just magnificent in this part.Thomas Mitchell is always given kudos for his part and they are deserved but one who's not talked about is John Qualen. Qualen had a fine run of character parts in his long career of little men constantly being victimized. He started that cycle with The Front Page and continues it on with Muley in The Grapes of Wrath and now this part in Angels Over Broadway. He was a fine but underrated actor and another favorite of John Ford.It's worth it just to see Rita Hayworth as always and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. with that New York City accent.";

	schema:reviewBody "1940's Angels Over Broadway is actually a little play on words since the name of one of the main characters is Engle which in German means Angel actually spelled Engel. Written by Ben Hecht the film stars Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Rita Hayworth Thomas Mitchell and John Qualen. It's an interesting and sweet film with very good performances but you would swear it's based on a play because it is extremely heavy on dialogue.The story concerns four people who wind up joining forces a wheeler dealer named Bill O'Brien Fairbanks Jr. a suicidal man Engle Qualen a lonely performer Nina Hayworth and a drunken playwright Eugene Gibbons Mitchell. Engle needs to come up with 3000 that he embezzled by morning O'Brien thinks Engle is a rich sucker Nina is looking to meet someone successful and Gibbons has written another flop. They all are in the same nightclub. While intoxicated Gibbons learns Engle's sad story and is determined to help him. His first move  taking back a piece of 12000 jewelry from his girlfriend  does not work as after he takes it she tells him it's paste. Though O'Brien had planned to bring Gibbons to a poker game so he could lose a lot of money to thugs and O'Brien could earn a bonus it is decided that Engle should go instead and skip out after winning the initial money that the players will allow him to win to draw him into a false sense of luck. Nina goes along interested in O'Brien even after she finds out he's broke.One of the most amusing aspects of the film is that everyone  including the mobsters  knows who the Gibbons character is. They all sayOh yeah you're the playwright. Anyone who has ever watched Jeopardy knows that today no one knows current playwrights by name or face let alone current plays. The film is interesting as well because is that although this is really four individual stories the plots converge so that the film is not in the least episodic.Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is marvelous as usual. The man could be the most elegant of British gentlemen or a born and bred New York lowlife. Here he is the latter and a delight. I am so glad a previous comment mentioned Marilyn Monroe  she must have been influenced by Hayworth in this film as Hayworth's voice and delivery in spots can only be described as preMarilyn. Monroe couldn't have had a better role model. Hayworth is just beautiful and gives a sympathetic portrayal of Nina. Mitchell's performance is heartrending especially when he calls his wife on the telephone. Qualen has precious little dialogue but he too does a great job as a desperate man.Definitely recommended for the acting and the structure of the film which is masterful.".

Codirected by a writer Hecht made seven films in this multiple capacity but this is the first one I've watched! and a cinematographer that were second to none in their respective professions it's small wonder that the film is brimming with sparkling dialogue particularly as delivered by Thomas Mitchell here in his trademark role of philosophical drunk and inventive shadowy lighting.The main roles however are equally wellfilled Mitchell as I said wasn't really stretching himself here but his three costars  Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Rita Hayworth and John Qualen  had rarely been offered such an opportunity to shine up to this point. Fairbanks' bestknown role had been his 'smiling villain' Rupert of Hentzau in THE PRISONER OF ZENDA 1937 where's that DVD Warners? but he had already made other impressive ensemble pieces such as THE YOUNG IN HEART 1938 see my review elsewhere and GUNGA DIN 1939 actually his role here is sort of similar to that of the former  though he's a harder character an utter heel but whose scheme of 'taking' a man he believes to be a millionaire rebounds on himself and actually ends up involved in the 'taking' of his 'business partners' to the benefit of the latter who's really an embezzler on the brink of suicide! The unwilling crook is played by John Qualen the great  if largely unsung  diminutive and mildmannered character actor whose other notable roles included the murderer in HIS GIRL Friday 1940 a victim of the Oklahoma Dustbowl in THE GRAPES OF WRATH 1940 and Miser Stevens in THE DEVIL AND DANIEL WEBSTER 1941. The film's feminine interest then is provided by a young Rita Hayworth who again exceeds all expectations with her role of a starstruck girl who forsakes her dreams of glory in order to do a good deed even if she's initially drawn into the 'plot' purely on a whim by Fairbanks indeed the characters' individual reformation  more so than in THE YOUNG IN HEART and done in a much less sentimental manner  adds an undercurrent of spirituality to the film's prominent sophistication and hardboiled veneer which is not so surprising coming from Hecht! For its time ANGELS OVER Broadway must have seemed like a Bmovie with pretensions while it falters here and there under the strain of its own selfindulgence because it is unique the film doesn't feel all that dated today and is bound to give detailed pleasure on every viewing.".

	schema:headline " Rita Hayworth as a sweet kid";
	schema:reviewBody "This early Rita Hayworth movie shows off her more youthful charms of innocence and good will. She was not yet a femme fatale or a glamour queen although she does get an opportunity for a brief dance. She was born Margarita 'Rita' Cansino in a family of dancers so she could dance before she could act and made numerous film appearances as Rita Cansino before she was reinvented by Columbia Studios. This film has never been released on DVD so I had to buy an old video to see it. It is written produced and directed by Ben Hecht and describes Hecht's Broadway of that era. The unlikely casting of glamour boy Douglas Fairbanks Junior as a smalltime chiseller is a surprise. He does tolerably well but is no genius at it. Thomas Mitchell plays an inebriated playwright who five years ago won the Pulitzer Prize but is now a flop. Well that's Broadway! Or was! I am referring to a time of course when they still had plays on Broadway and not just musicals. Yes believe it or not way back in the Stone Age there was something called drama on the Great White Way but only mastodons and plesiosaurs got my geological eras mixed up but who cares remember it. The film features a fine performance from sadsack character actor John Qualen as 'Charles Engle' a rather obvious pun on the title of the film 'Engel' being German for angel. The film is very heavy on dialogue and somewhat preachy but Hecht's dialogue is interesting and often extremely witty so even though it is longer than a modern 'text message' it is worth listening to. The film was made after all before attention spans shrank to five seconds. The story is rather contrived and corny and lurches rather heavily in the direction of Moral Messages. Well good for Hecht he was trying to get some messages across rather than just titillate. So he was a bit clumsy at it. The film is still very good and well worth watching. And there is the irresistible Rita to gaze at in wonder and awe. Sometimes you just want to give her a hug don'tcha?".

Rita Hayworth was just glorious! As usual. I wonder if Marilyn Monroe saw this movie and used Rita's slight speech impediment. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is always wonderful. I'm a fan of such actors as John Qualen and Thomas Mitchell. They are good in everything. I also liked finding two new actors to look for in old films Jack Roper the boxer who played Eddie and Eddie Foster who played Louie Artino. The black  white was almost delicious the rain put the movie into a certain mood and the sets were perfection. Wardrobe was easy no one changed except for taking off their rain coats. I liked it and I want to see it again soon which shouldn't be a problem with TCM they have started showing the same movies over  over anyway. I recommend Angels Over Broadway!".

So it was with great delight that I came across this exceptional film with its screwball comedy timing and humor and its amazing ensemble casting  from a sleazy but compelling performance by Douglas Fairbanks Jr. to the ironic portrayal of the hasbeen drunk played to iconic perfection by Thomas Mitchell.But the two real gems are John Qualen as a suicidal bookkeeper who is the target of a 2 bit mob scam and Rita Hayworth in a portrayal as exceptional to me as Rosalind Russell in The Front Page or Marilyn Monroe in 7 Year Itch  a starstruck wannabe who is barely making it in shady circumstances yet manages to convey tremendous innocence and idealism in spite of her deeply compromised situation.The most striking thing to me of all is how uncanny it is to watch what one would consider to be a classic Monroe performance coming from an actress seven years prior to Marilyn having been given her first on screen part. Suddenly I felt like I understood how Marilyn had crafted her persona  hours of sitting in darkened theaters watching Rita Hayworth concoct her brilliant magic of innocence and seduction like it was real and not a carefully crafted act.In my humble opinion I don't believe Marilyn would have been nearly as iconic had she not had Rita Hayworth's example to follow and this portrayal in Angels Over Broadway is the link that to me irrefutably proves my point! What an amazing underappreciated work of group talent and screen writing art! Rita is poignantly brilliant and her performance ranks for me with Robert Williams in Platinum Blonde for great naturalistic acting that lasts through time.".

	schema:reviewBody "A comedy that examines the hopelessness of modern urban life  Ben Hecht combines the bitter and the sweet with a dash of autobiography thrown in. The legendary theater man acted as writer producer and codirector on this film making a supremely ironic bid to eclipse young Orson Welles. Perhaps the film's only major fault is its ambitiousness  like the inebriated hasbeen playwright played in the film by Thomas Mitchell this film sets up too much for it to satisfactorily resolve. However I prefer a stew with too many ingredients than too few. When Mitchell's character begins to refer to Rita Hayworth and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as characters that he is rewriting into the hero and heroine we know we're in for something special and we're not wrong.Hayworth's acting here is more effortless than usual allowing her charm to come full to the fore. Doug Fairbanks Jr. was never more natural or believable than he was here playing a suave nobody. I thought their banter had some real appeal  they spend the picture posing for each other acknowledging their poses and then acting hurt when the other recognizes the truth. The film also presents a rare opportunity for a real performance from John Qualen as well. If you don't bite your nails when the poor guy is trying to pretend to be a bigshot at the pokertable you've got no heart.This film came out in 1940 but it's really a meditation on the decade that preceded it. The theme is similar to Casablanca but with purely humanist goals instead of patriotic ones. Fairbanks is a ruined idealist pretending to be a hardened cynic. Hayworth is a ruined romantic pretending to be a whore. It says a lot about how urban Americans saw themselves at the time and how Mr. Hecht thought they could seek some form of redemption  note the title Angels not Angel. This isn't a story of redemption through love but rather love through redemption. It's vastly underrated and deserves to be remembered as one of the milestones in Hecht's astonishing career. Lee Garmes has contributed some very nice photographic details such as the startling overhead shot of the gambling table and the opening shots of Fairbanks in the rain. An outstanding production which amounts to a witty film equally dark and convincingly optimistic.".

	schema:reviewBody "The script by Ben Hecht and the performances of Thomas Mitchell and John Qualen make this sardonic drama of clichd Manhattan types all the more fun to follow. It is the old con game where the innocent is used to fleece the guilty. Qualen has written a suicide note after stealing 3000 from his partner and with the help of a down on his luck playwright a con man and a chorus girl he discovers a possible way out of his predicament. This leads Qualen to end up in a card game with a group of serious gamblers and with Mitchell Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Rita Hayworth he has the possibility of not only paying back his partner but also making a bit of a profit.The leads are Fairbanks and Hayworth but it will be the two supporting characters that you will remember. Mitchell is the playwriter and Qualen every bit as pathetic here as he was in His Girl Friday is the embezzler without an escape plan. Mitchell is initially seen in a lavish nightclub drunker then a skunk spitting out acerbic comments about everything going on around him and regretting a divorce which lead to his current unhappy marriage. Fairbanks has a great opening scene being sort of a Greek chorus to the common folk around him but becomes so selfserving as the plot develops. Hayworth not quite yet established as a bombshell cover girl does a fine job of exploring this character's innocence and is lovely if not yet magnetic. A card game between Qualen and a serious group of gamblers is truly intriguing and it is interesting to see if Qualen will get out of this without being beaten into a pulp. There are some great camera shots of the game going on as the camera looks from above them and Qualen a expresses his fear over being caught with great expertise. However it is Mitchell who gets the best dialogue and a scene where he contacts his unseen ex wife is very emotional. While the plot isn't 100 believable it is done with fine acting a script that keeps you interested and a direction that helps the movie flow perfectly. as dark comedies gothis is Hollywood at its wittiest and most intelligent and that's where the high rating for this forgotten classic comes in.".

It's a budget conscious B programmer at best with a B storyline despite the presence of Ben Hecht as writerproducerdirector.Disgruntled Charles Engle John Qualen has been caught by his boss Mr. Hopper George Watts with his hand in the till to the tune of 3000. Engle writes a suicide note and then wanders the streets aimlessly until he goes into a seedy nightclub. Street hustler Bill O'Brien Douglas Fairbanks Jr. thinks Engle is a millionaire and plans to con him into a high stakes poker game and make off with the proceeds. Gold digger Nina Barona an out of work dancer enters the picture and O'Brien plans to utilize her in his scheme.Down on his luck boozy playwright Gene Gibbons Thomas Mitchell accidently stumbles upon Engle's suicide note and decides to help him. Now aware that Engle is broke O'Brien and Gibbons hatch a plan whereby Engel will still participate in the poker game but with a mind to take off as soon as he wins the 3000 he needs to repay Hopper. O'Brien then plans to take whatever money Engle wins over 3000 for himself.They four go to a cheap hotel where the gangster laden poker game will take place. Gibbons promptly passes out. O'Brien brings Engle to the game where he wins several thousands. He excuses himself to go check on Gibbons but...........................................................................................Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is totally miscast as the gum chewing con man with the New York Accent. Hecht must have enticed him with an Associate Producer's credit to get him on board. Rita Hayworth was still being built up as a major star at this time and is given several generous close ups through out the film. She does have a dramatic moment near the climax of the film in a scene with Fairbanks. Veteran character actors Mitchell and Qualen steal the film.

	onyx:emotionText "Make no mistake Angels Over Broadway is nothing more than a vehicle for upcoming Columbia star Rita Hayworth. It's a budget conscious B programmer at best with a B storyline despite the presence of Ben Hecht as writerproducerdirector.Disgruntled Charles Engle John Qualen has been caught by his boss Mr. Hopper George Watts with his hand in the till to the tune of 3000. Engle writes a suicide note and then wanders the streets aimlessly until he goes into a seedy nightclub. Street hustler Bill O'Brien Douglas Fairbanks Jr. thinks Engle is a millionaire and plans to con him into a high stakes poker game and make off with the proceeds. Gold digger Nina Barona an out of work dancer enters the picture and O'Brien plans to utilize her in his scheme.Down on his luck boozy playwright Gene Gibbons Thomas Mitchell accidently stumbles upon Engle's suicide note and decides to help him. Now aware that Engle is broke O'Brien and Gibbons hatch a plan whereby Engel will still participate in the poker game but with a mind to take off as soon as he wins the 3000 he needs to repay Hopper. O'Brien then plans to take whatever money Engle wins over 3000 for himself.They four go to a cheap hotel where the gangster laden poker game will take place. Gibbons promptly passes out. O'Brien brings Engle to the game where he wins several thousands. He excuses himself to go check on Gibbons but...........................................................................................Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is totally miscast as the gum chewing con man with the New York Accent. Hecht must have enticed him with an Associate Producer's credit to get him on board. Rita Hayworth was still being built up as a major star at this time and is given several generous close ups through out the film. She does have a dramatic moment near the climax of the film in a scene with Fairbanks. Veteran character actors Mitchell and Qualen steal the film. Mitchell's phone call to his wife is a poignant scene and Qualen's despondent all is lost scenes at the beginning are memorable. Also in the cast are Ralph Theodore as Dutch Enright Eddie Foster as Louie Artino and Jack Roper as punch drunk Eddie Burns crooks all.";

	schema:reviewBody "This film turned up as a surprise like so many of Ben Hecht's films do  he had his hand in almost every quality film of the 40s50s and this was not only written by him but also directed and produced so it's one of those very rare films that is more or less completely Ben Hecht's own. The story is typical of his going to extremes about everything  there is a suicide candidate a drunk a reckless adventurer a gang of gangsters setting up poker games to kill the victim a loose young lady a loser playwright and a lot of intrigue. It rains almost throughut the film to make matters worse so most of the action is indoors in a night club of course in a shabby hotel with a poker room dense with smoke and the obligatory window exit of someone getting out at any cost like in almost every one of his films. Although the character of the film is dark like an early noir it's actually a charming comedy. The protagonists get together in a cozy kind of way there is no hostility or quarrel but rather the opposite they keep warming up to each other through the entire film until the weather clears and the drama is over actually to the satisfaction of everyone. Douglas Fairbanks gets a plastered nose but that is about all the bloodshed. Nothing serious although it's dead serious all the way but things get sorted out more or less by themselves.".

So in light of my adoration of Hollywood's golden age and the preponderance of very favorable reviews here on IMDb it surprised me that I disliked this film as much as I did. To me it is a film that comes off as stagy overly talky and unconvincing.The film is about a group of losers who all meet in a nightclub one night. One is Charles Engle John Qualena guy who embezzled some money but who others in the club mistake for a millionaire. Another is a famous but down and out playwright Thomas Mitchell. And there's the sharpie Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and a woman he enlists to help him Rita Hayworth. While there are some nice moments in the film and some of the acting is pretty good I particularly liked Qualen too often the film comes off as a play clumsily brought to film. In other words it retains its stagy quality and characters tend to bluster and talk too much for a movie. Additionally while I generally like Fairbanks in films here he seems a tad miscast and out of place. Overall a mildly interesting film that definitely gets better as you watch it but nothing more.".

But Doug Fairbanks Jr. very miscast completely unbelievable as a fasttalking Broadway heel. Would have been a perfect part for the Bogart of that time. And what happened at the end? The sudden turnaround of the Fairbanks character and his decision to stick with Rita Hayworth in literally the last five seconds of the movie rang totally false. I had to look at the scene again because I wondered if perhaps I had missed something like did he win the lottery or what? No. He simply put down his coffee cup changed his mind and chased after Rita in the pouring rain. Maybe Harry Cohen told Hecht he wanted a happy ending. So old Ben gave him one that didn't involve him having to spend one more day on the set. What really happened? Should Fairbanks have wound up in the gutter with a bunch of bullets in his back with Rita cradling him in her arms?Who knows? And in the long haul who cares?".
