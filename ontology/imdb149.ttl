I just feel like people should know at least what I gathered from this film. I have not watched the original but what i have understood is that people seemed irritated that some proffesional reviewers wrote it off as a women hating violent movie and nothing more.Now i have read some of the reviews for this and a lot of people say the same thing. Just a violent nasty and judgesrates it on that. IT Isn't. In fact this is one of the saddest movies i have seen. I think its wrong to say that it isn't violent. It has violence that makes you want to turn away. But its not about that. It doesn't rely on violence. The main character is a troubled man that tries to live his life dealing with his issues. He doesn't have anyone and doesn't know how to deal with them alone.Its a 1st person dramathriller with a sad but beautiful techno music to blend in with the neon lighted feel of this movie. The acting of Elijah wood is brilliant in that he mostly needs to act with his voice and not his face. The story is sad and i cant help but feel sad for the main character much like The Voices staring Ryan Reynolds. The movie focuses so much on there psychological problems that it just comes of as tragic and sad. This isn't a horror movie with no story and disposable characters. This is a character built character driven sad movie that is beautiful both visual and story wise.".

I thought the material would have been watered down but this is just as grisly and depressing as the original. There's plenty of reason to watch not least Elijah Wood who makes a good psychopath as he did in SIN CITY the whole film is shot through the killer's point of view which gives things an edgy fresh feel. I loved the use of music and cinematography throughout which reminded me of Refn's style in DRIVE so it's a little bit of a shame that the story is so unrelentingly dark and miserable.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie at an advanced screening of what I thought was a restoration of the original movie. Instead I got treated to movie that I didn't even know was being released. The Maniac remake is a really good movie and better than its predecessor which was more notable for its Tom Savini gore effects and unconventional leading man than for actually being a good movie.This flick like the previous Maniac dispels the idea that psychopaths are cool or bad ass. Here Frank Elijah Wood is a weirdo loner that spends his days restoring antique mannequins and his nights stalking murdering and scalping beautiful young women. His grip on reality is so fragile that he has to chug antipsychotics just to keep his hallucinations under control. Then he meets a pretty young French girl that actually seems to like him. Instead of offering redemption the burgeoning relationship only makes him more unstable.The murders are bloody and brilliantly shot and they're made dramatically more by disturbing the film's central gimmick almost the entire movie is presented from the killer's POV.The new Maniac does a solid job of capturing the grindhouse spirit of the original film. There's plenty of sick humor sex and gore all well captured by director Frank Khalfoun. He also partnered with Alaxander Aja High Tension The Hill Have Eyes a cowriter and producer on the disposable P2 which sucked despite not because of him. Then he made the superior crime flick Wrong Turn at Tahoe. Now after watching Maniac I have to say he is officially a director to keep an eye on. Elijah Wood also does great work as Frank although I admit it took me a little while to get used to the idea of the stoner dork from Wilfred as a murderer. He definitely won me over by the end though.There are minor problems here and there like the way the whole city is always completely deserted when Frank is stalking a victim. Still this is a great little movie very violent and if you're a gore hound that's also interested in the psychology of a killer you should watch this immediately.".

What is unique about this movie is that it put you in the view point of the killer and for the most part goes in a first person view direction. And just with that this movie can get difficult to watch at points. Watching this movie was liked watching a slasher version of Enter the Void except instead of a wandering spirit it's in the view point of the killer. Elijah Wood is really good at playing this obsessive creepy or mentally unstable psycho killer roles. And he really nails it in this one as well. Although it lacks in tension it makes up for it with the visuals and the psychological aspect of things. Now I haven't seen the original and while this is a remake I think it's a stand alone film. It's a disturbing film from start to finish and will have most people's attention that can handle it all the way through. Psycho slasher movie fans will most definitely enjoy this one.7.610".

Starring Joe Spinnel and directed by William Lustig it was one of the most intense jarring violent and in your face horror films of the entire decade. Surprisingly someone got the idea to remake it. The results are surprisingly close to the original in its refusal to compromise and the highly disturbing and troubling psychological terrain it traverses.Not so much powered by anything resembling a conventional story the film is very much in the tradition of character based cinema very much in the vein of 1970's New Hollywood cinemafilms such as Midnight Cowboy and of course Taxi Driver which it wears its influence loudly and proudly.Elijah Wood absolutely stuns in this remakehe truly is the glue that holds it all together. Frank Wood is very much torn between something resembling a normal life and his more psychotic tendencies. The film really gets you in this character's highly disturbed and disturbing frame of mind and psychology.Apart from a truly astounding and fearless performance from Wood where this remake really excels is in its visual and sound design and look and sound. When Frank is plagued by constant migraine headaches the frame starts to blur around the edges accompanied by a high pitched sound. Also with a few exceptions the film is very much told visually in a first perspective point of view manner. We only see Frank via reflection in something like a mirror or a window illustrating beautifully the man's fractured and shattered mind.Be warned though. Although not constantly violent when it is this film like the original takes absolutely no prisoners whatsoever! This coupled with the unnerving dark terrain it covers will like the original make it something of an acquired taste. If you've got the nerves and stomach for it prepare to be shocked and stunned. A true exception to the rule about all remakes being watered down compromised and awful.".

Firstly the music throughout the movie is awesome there are moments when the soundtrack sounds like something from 'A Clockwork Orange' its dark and really creates an atmosphere of sinisterness.Elijah Wood is perfect for this role his voice and delivery of the script is great. The movie is shot from the killers point of view POV but the moments when you actually see Elijah Wood he looks perfect for this role strange disturbed out of place and mentally unstable.The violence is not excessive in its amount but it is extremely brutal in its detail it wasn't easy to watch the scalping without cringing and i have a strong threshold for movie gore this was just brutal and in your face it was great because very few films get to me in this way.If you like psycho movies and brutal gore then you'll love this movie like i did.'Maniac' is easily one of my favorite psycho killer movies of all time my girlfriend who actually loves horror and can handle gore has vowed never to watch 'Maniac' again because it made her feel so uncomfortable... aw!".

It had a lot of points that made me feel  for lack of a better word  plain icky.Elijah Wood does a great job dialing up the creep factor  he is incredibly believable as an unadulterated psychopath. Maniac recently got banned in some locales because of its content so that alone says that it does well in the horror genre.It's unsettling creepy gross. It does what it sets out to do pretty well. The direction is good in this film as is the cinematography for a remake it was exceptional!".

Elijah Wood is an actor I like and he is excellent in this as the serial killing maniac. I found it hard to get into the film but this is one film that gradually improves as it goes along rather than fades away. Along with the bloody horror there are a number of really tense scenes. It is the most unsettling film I've seen in a while. Maniac is well filmed and uses some very interesting filming techniques. I can't say I enjoyed watching it too much was a bit too sadistic for my taste. However for it's type this is a very good effort.".

	schema:headline " A deep and subtle meditation on sexuality and subjectivity";
	schema:reviewBody "Man! I was not expecting this kind of a knife to the gut when I bought my ticket for Maniac knowing nothing about the movie.I like horror movies...sort of...but I don't like gory movies. It scares me and disturbs me to see that kind of thing. This movie...is full of gruesome unwatchable scenes of torture.But...it works. This is one of the only gore films I've ever seen where the gore is necessary. Well why is it necessary? Most of the film is shot in firstperson perspective from the eyes of the troubled killer. He cannot reconcile his sadistic aggressive impulses to torture and punish women with his tender impulses to love and be loved by them. Whenever he is sexually attracted to a woman he responds with a host of symptoms that might be seen as unconscious attempts to protect him from something unbearable inside. He washes his hands until they bleed he blacks out he has hallucinations he has crippling migraines...but nothing works as well as killing and scalping women...reducing them to objects. The director plays cleverly with this conceit by making him a restorer of mannequins. So far so good. What this film does well...and I can't remember the last horror movie that had this effect on me...is to hit dangerously close to home. I recognize myself in this killer...I recognize that masculine desire as such has the potential to turn into what is presented here...the main character barely appears on screen...he is nothing but a desperate gaze seeking an object to consume with his scary watery blue eyes. It is only once he has killed his victims and transformed them into inanimate objects  their bloody scalps the scalping in this movie is even worse than in Inglourious Basterds  that he is able to come to be temporarily as a subject and not as a pure restless gaze. The director makes us feel his relief by only giving us thirdperson glimpses of the titular maniac when his blood lust is temporarily sated. I found myself letting out a deep breath every time the camera backed away from Frank for a few short seconds after a kill. We feel viscerally the backandforth between the libido's ruthless injunctions and the stifled desire to be a human being among other humans here being included literally in the frame with others. Incidentally this is why this film works in a way that The Lady in the Lake doesn't  the pure first person fails in that film because in life we do not experience ourselves only from the first person but rather from a backandforth between the first and the third person. The many scenes of the maniac stalking the women are very creepy for the simple reason that much of what he does  looking at women maybe following them a little perving on their curves  is just normal male behavior. On my way home from the movie lost in thought late at night on an empty street I nearly walked into a young woman walking home alone and then found myself walking behind her on the sidewalk. I hope she didn't see the same movie I did.But why is the gore necessary? The gore is necessary because this film is a meditation on the subjectobject split constitutive of subjectivity as such. The pure subject that is gaze can only be satisfied by encountering a pure object one that can only be found somewhere inside the body of a woman. Freud might say that Frank is searching for the fantasized maternal phallus...an interpretation that fits perfectly with the maniac's backstory. We need to see the gore because we need to feel the frustration that this character feels...we come to understand that he is so oppressed by his own subjectivity the prison of his own gaze that he is compelled to commit horrible crimes to cut through bone and skin just to get some relief from his drives. Another creepy and effective feature of this film is that at least one of his victims is an awful human being whom we want to see die. It is disturbing to realize this. Get her Frank! I found myself rooting as he followed the gallerist home. It was also perspicacious of the director to present Anna to us first as a sort of angelic soul who presumably sees the maniac's inner beauty only to reveal to us later that in fact she is a shallow narcissist whose interest in Frank was always selfserving. We are as surprised as Frank when she says she has a boyfriend...why? Because she has been leading us on until then. The nickel drops when we meet her boyfriend in the bathroom he is a sexy macho jerk the kind of man women like Anna like in real life. Anna turns out to be almost a female counterpart to Frank a woman not interested in other human beings but in objects...in the mysterious object inside herself hence her own face projected on the mannequins...we sense that the difference between her and Frank is a question of degree not of kind...the true difference between them is that they occupy asymmetrical positions visavis the same hypnotic object the maternal phallus hidden somewhere inside a woman's body. A brave role for Elijah Wood...brave because it uses to full advantage his weird blend of adult and infantile features...his very body and face especially the eyes are turned into disturbing external manifestations of his inner conflicts. 8 stars for a movie that has made me feel viscerally some disturbing truths about sexuality and identity that previously only registered on the intellectual level.".

	schema:headline " Same Ol' MANIAC new generation.";
	schema:reviewBody "I had the pleasure of catching this at Horrorhound Weekend in March. The viewing room was a packed house for this one so I along with everyone else was also curious of how IFC would take Maniac and make a new movie. Normally with IFC I give it hit Dead Snow Stake Land Tormented or miss Human Centipede ATM etc. I have to say the IFC did it right this time with Maniac. First off I've got to make point that hearing Elijah Wood was gonna be stepping in to the socially awkward and mentally disturbing shoes of Joe Spinell I was immediately worried but it is with great pleasure I can say that Elijah Wood embodies MANIAC through the movie.The movie begins establishing how unsettling this movies going to be by showing us the killer's Wood P.O.V. which is how 90 of the movie is shot. Making the next 90 minutes more haunting than the original as you get the sensation that you the viewer are now the killer. Following the kills you can be sure that IFC isn't gonna short you on the gore and by God they don't not even 10 minutes in you are treated to a brutal bloody disturbing scalp removal of a beautiful young woman which is one of many in the film. The violence is infrequent but when it's present it's brutal haunting disturbing and BLOODY much like the original. In fact there are very few things different from the original in this well shot remake. Frank Wood is a mannequin restorator who takes pride in his work. So much so that he surrounds himself with them all the time. Frank's childhood shown through flashbacks gives the insight of his whore mother always bringing a guys home and performing sexual activities on them while poor Frank was forced to watch. As a result mentally disturbed Frank now goes out and kills young woman by removing their scalps then putting them on his mannequins to keep the spirit alive and keep them forever. Standing out in this nightmare of a film stands Wood who really does convince you that he is indeed a MANIAC. Whether it's the constant disillusioned images he forces on himself scrubbing his hands with tin foil after a fresh kill or sharing a bed with a mannequin surrounded by flies due to the rotting scalp stapled to its head this is not the Wood we know. The various shots edits and sequences make MANIAC luckily out to be a good remake that will not disappoint fans of the infamous original classic at all.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit prior to watching this film I had very little idea of what to expect from this remake. I was aware of the original but having not seen it and despite being a fan of Alexandre Aja and Franck Khalfoun's other work as a producers and directors such as Switchblade Romance and P2 was unsure whether this film would be just another genre slasher movie.I was therefore really surprised by how original and good the actual film was. The main selling point is the majority of the film is shown from our protagonist  anti hero's perspective in a first person viewpoint. Whilst this has been done before in various guises on other films and music videos to have a full film like this particularly a horror adds a fresh take on something that is quite well worn now and really brings back memories of the sheer terror displayed by the victims in something like Peeping Tom an absolute classic.However this does not mean it falls into another Paranormal Activity style shaky handycam experience. The cinematography is superb and very inventive  particularly the night time shots which evoke a beautiful neon LA nighttime haze reminiscent of Drive or Collateral. You quickly forget that this is an unusual slightly alien viewpoint for a full feature and become involved in living through Elijah Wood's character who manages to achieve an impressive degree of emotion and empathy through essentially voiceover hand acting and snatched glimpses of his reflection in mirrors and car windows. His character is almost an innocent so unnerved by human interaction that whenever he gets into a potentially romantic situation or starts to feel any kind of lustful feelings he actually becomes physically ill and quite simply cuts them off and destroys them dead and in a literal sense  the person who is causing them. You do almost feel sorry for him because he is unable to get close to anyone and break this cycle but obviously his brutal methods of killing these women whose only crime is to show some kind of interest in him is very disturbing and not that easy to stomach or sympathise with. The women themselves because they are the focus of our and the protagonist's gaze have to work incredibly hard to make an interaction with the camera and also not to simply look like they are reciting lines like a monologue to the screen. It works incredibly well and naturally for the most part with fleeting glances out of frame or nervous looks to their feet when talking to the camera to really make the interactions feel natural and real rather than constantly fixing their eyes on the centre of the camera lens which would presumably have been the easiest and most natural thing to do when acting this.All in all then a great film with strong performances I worry that it may be too arty for the slasher crowd and too brutal for the arthouse scene but hopefully it will find an audience because it is a great piece of work. Definitely Recommended!".

Beautifully photographed with an emphasis on the POV which is bound to attract controversy an attempt at griminess no lacking in gore and a simple story in a film that doesn't overrun it's basic premise with a long running time.The original film had it's problems Caroline Munro interested in Joe Spinell. At one point Frank meets with an online date who exclaims he was not what she expected and pretty much describes Joe Spinell.I don't think this will gain many fans or critical praise even hardcore horror fans I know were unware it had been made  but fans of the original will have a chuckle and others will appreciate a well made tight horror film.I find it odd that the cast are listed alphabetically so Elijah Wood is last on screen and not listed at all on the IMDb basic cast list.

	schema:headline " You Can't Duplicate Heart and Soul";
	schema:reviewBody "First I can't understand why the original had to be remade. What made that film special wasn't the direction from William Lustig or the gore effects from Tom Savini although they did do a top notch job but rather the world created by Joe Spinell. He is the true heart and soul of the original movie and like anyone's heart and soul it could never be duplicated. He had as much to do with the film's direction as Lustig did and even poured much of his own money into it. Once you strip Spinell from the original it just becomes a generic slasher film so I ask again why was this remade? Just make a similar movie with a different title and character names. Its not like the title Maniac has a lot of name value...This movie is exactly what you expect from someone trying to duplicate something unique. A generic modernized version of a classic with a few gimmicks thrown in so they could at least say they tried. The POV gimmick is just terrible. There's a reason why you don't see films being made this way besides foundfootage garbage. I guess it's an attempt to put us into Frank's head but its truly unnecessary and doesn't work cinematically. It just comes off as a hokey and desperate attempt to standout. If you want to standout do so by making a good movie not by changing the camera angle. Good filmmaking requires much more than that.Elijah Wood as Frank is a true testament to modern filmmaking Use a pretty face on a killer to create irony OR to cash in on that actor's name value. Joe Spinell wasn't a household name when he did Maniac. Probably due to his appearance. He most definitely didn't have a pretty face. He was overweight and someone you could imagine having trouble making friends in school. When I watch the original I see an ugly man who struggles with social stress as a result. He makes that role completely believable. Elijah Wood does not. I can't even go into Wood's acting because it's absolutely minimal in this film since nearly all of the movie is POV.Another huge gripe for me was the CGI. The first death scene of the film is supposed to set the tone for the rest of the film. But what do we get? A hokey CGI death. Although the rest of the film does in fact have practical effects they're CGI enhanced. Compare this scene with the opening death scene of the original Maniac and tell me which looks more realistic and less hokey.Despite how much I disliked this movie and how much of an atrocity it is compared to the original I did find that music absolutely perfect for a Maniactype film. It's just a real shame it was wasted on such trash.Whats truly disturbing are all the good reviews here on IMDb. A few have even said this film was better than the original. Some have said they haven't seen the original so they couldn't compare. But I say DO compare you may be shocked to realize how much better the original film is! Regardless reviews do not make a movie good so I'm hoping that as the film becomes more commercially available the true face of this film will come through from the new reviews...or maybe not.I was once at a screening of the original Maniac in NYC at the Sunshine Theater of which William Lustig was attending to do a Q and A he only lives blocks away from the theater. When asked about selling the rights for a remake he stated and I quote exactly I'm a whore for money. Another sad day in horror. Spinell would've been saddened by this...".

Dawn of the Dead The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Halloween a film's classic status is no protection against a fresh new and usually CGI laden reimagining. And for all you true fuhreelz screw the mainstream horror fans don't you go thinking that your scuzzy grindhouse classics such as I Spit on Your Grave or Last House on the Left are gonna get off lightly either because they've already been remade as well...... Which brings us to Maniac. You all remember Maniac right? Bill Lustig's dirty sweaty claustrophobic and nigh on plot less little grubfest? Who in the hell would wish to remake this and for what purpose? It was a product of its time right? And there's no way you could put a 21st century spin on this and still expect it to retain the grimy verve of the original which made it for all its flaws something of a cult classic right? And there's no frickin' way that the Lord of the Rings Hobbit dude is gonna fill in Joe Spinnel's size 9's right?Well... wrong actually. Because Maniac 2012 is also a dirty sweaty claustrophobic and nigh on plot less little grubfest... that works with Woods underplaying things nicely and the film itself having a surprisingly arty but effective vibe to it. Swapping the location from the pee stained alleys and subways of 80s New York for the sun drenched and sterile neon glare of 21st century LA we follow our addled protagonist Frank Woods as he relentlessly stalks and scalps his prey. La is a surprisingly effective substitute for NY as instead of the sun kissed palm trees and Beautiful People we're treated instead to dirty graffiti daubed alleys and sterile but seedy looking subways grimy arenas of death where Frank stalks his victims.However the main difference here is that we the audience are treated almost entirely to things via Frank's POV and indeed we actually very rarely see our protagonists face except via mainly reflections in a mirror. However this works all the better as we're given an intimate perhaps too intimate perspective of Frank's fractured world.While not as gratuitous or luridly exploitative as the original what violence there is is stark raw and shot with this dead straight nasty and decidedly mean spirited tone that makes for eyebrow raising viewing in parts and best of all the CGI is kept to a bare minimum with the kill scenes primarily using old school style FX. The film also engages in some sweaty unerotic voyeurism which gives it a surprisingly creepy tone overall.Maniac is probably the most ambitious heartfelt and best remake I've ever seen since The Blob and this isn't something I'd say lightly. It emerges as its own stand alone film and in tone is as serious a study of its protagonist as Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer 1986 or even Angst 1983While I have and will always have an enduring love for Lusatig's original I gotta say the remake is technically better made. It's also geared toward fans of the original and more serious less casual horror fans in general. It readily states it's Based on the motion picture Maniac by William Lustig and has its title garishly displayed in large blood red letters in a subtle wink to the original and the film has also several sly homages to the first that fans of the original should spot including an underplayed reference to Joe Spinnell. It's also in association with Lustig's Blue Underground company with Lustig producing.Maniac is a film I suspect will improve for me on revisits and it surpassed my already high expectations for it which I'd had before going in due to its consistently positive reviews. It's a very good remake a really good horror film in its own right and I reckon it'll appeal to fans of the original. The director Frank Khalfoun is either clearly a fan of the original or else knows how much it's revered by its fans. Either way his 21st century spin on an 80s grimy classic works all the better and is the best version any fan of the original could hope for.810 a surprisingly good horror film and a great remake and recommended for fans of the original and fans of more visceral horror in general.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a particularly nasty film that revels in shocking the audience with as much gratuitous violence as it can squeeze in. If you enjoy watching realistic scenes of women being tortured mutilated and scalped you will almost certainly enjoy this. If on the other hand you are looking for a film that tries to explain or understand the psychology of the characters you are looking in the wrong place. The film tries to be clever by viewing the action through the eyes of the main character presumably to personalise the violence. It really makes no difference. Gratuatous violence is gratuitous violence regardless of perspective. I have always been against censorship but films like this do make me question my belief in anticensorship.".

A tight narrative packed with gore an immense stalking scene and a chilling soundtrack. Maniac proves that a successful remake is possible.

I'm not quite sure how they did it but it looked amazing seeing Franks reflection in mirrors with no camera to be seen especially when the shot pans away to something else. As for the narrative my title says it all. I'm not quite sure what the film was missing. The POV perspective was interesting. It makes you feel as if you're trapped in the character's body as he seems to be trapped in it in a weird way. It feels like he doesn't want to be doing the things he does and the first person perspective really enhances that. I felt that parts of the movie were amazing. My problem was that during parts of the murder scenes the film lost it's intelligence and just felt like another slasher movie. The main character is clearly a deeply disturbed man and the psychological angle to the film was excellent. But the murder scenes felt like they just added in random crap to make it creepier. And at parts it focused to much on gore. Overall I'd say this was a good movie. It did a few things wrong and there's just something about it that I can't really put my finger on as to what was wrong with it. If there had been a few changes I think this movie could have been an easy 1010. But lastly Elijah Wood can really do a creepy character well.".

And eventually she will learn what he's really about.Maniac is filmed almost entirely in POV. But it's not the usual annoying shaky handheld stuff. Rather it's as if his eyes are the camera. We are truly seeing things from his perspective and hearing him talk to himself. The movie is gory and has some cool 70s music. It's not clear how or why his mother's activities would derail his life to such an extent. Since we take on the role of Frank basically it's hard for the audience to distance itself from him and you do end up rooting for him. But of course his affliction is an obstacle to connecting entirely with him. And at some level too the movie as a whole fails to engage. Something is missing not clear what. Perhaps it's the allPOV style that becomes tiring over time. Frank's relationship with Anna the photographer fails to have the impact it should. Maniac does have some neat late 70searly 80s touches and makes for a different horror experience.".

So the locals work together to build it up so it will qualify to be officially labeled a mountain. Sounds simple and even stupid but it isn't. Along the way a romance buds between Hugh Grant and Tara Fitzgerald. There also is some nice cinematography in here.Some might find it boring but I didn't.

Set against picturesque background of Welsh countryside and leisurely paced this movie totally won me over with its gentle humor and its colorful and beautifully developed characters. I'm not a big fan of Hugh Grant but here he performs quite well. Besides he is not what makes this movie work.I just love all the supporting characters  Thomas  Twp and Tara Fitzgerald as Betty and of course the pair of local archnemesis Rev. Jones and Morgan the Goat. I've seen Colm Meany in a few movies and on TV I think he plays in one of the Star Treck series and I've never thought much about him as an actor but he is simply hilarious as Morgan.So what is this movie about? There isn't much of a plot so without giving anything away I'll just say that it's about a  sleepy Welsh village coming together for a noble cause. What's the cause and would you find it noble?Watch the movie and judge for yourself.".

I've seen Colm Meany in a few movies and on TV I think he plays in one of the Star Treck series and I've never thought much about him as an actor but he is simply hilarious as Morgan.So what is this movie about? There isn't much of a plot so without giving anything away I'll just say that it's about a  sleepy Welsh village coming together for a noble cause. What's the cause and would you find it noble?Watch the movie and judge for yourself.";

The film starts out with some interesting trivia about how people got their names back then very quaint yet logical to attach an occupation to their names!

	schema:reviewBody "In 1919 the first world war is raging but in a small Welsh village two Englishmen arrive to measure the village's mountain.  When a preassessment reveals a prediction of below 1000ft the villagers are worried  but are incensed when the official measurement is 20 feet shy of mountain' and they find they now have a hill' instead.  They plot to keep the men in the village until they can pile enough earth on top of their hill to make it over 1000ft and win back their mountain.This film starts strong with a great sense of humour that it can't quite sustain but is enough to win you over and get into the story.  The romance doesn't come into the film until he second half but the whole film is very gentle and winning so that it all just flows together so very effortlessly. The humour at the top is a little sharper and it gets progressively slighter and mushier as it goes but it still works well.  Anyone who loves the Ealing comedies should enjoy this as it appears to aspire to that mould.I really dislike Grant and find his whole stuttering blinking act to be annoying most of the time  Mickey Blue Eyes is an example of the sort of performance that makes me want to give up hope for cinema.  However here it works dammit!  He does his usual stuff but it fits perfectly because his character has no malice and doesn't go against the stuttering etc.  The support cast is rich with humour.  Fitzgerald likewise keeps it all fizzy and superficial as the tone requires and Meaney is suitably funny.  Griffith is very good and Hart is a surprising cameo even if his character is a little too serious for the piece.Overall this is very slight and has a great feel of whimsy about it.  If you're not in the mood for this sort of thing then it's light nature may annoy you but it was just the ticket for me and I really enjoyed it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie proved to me what a fine actor Ian Hart is. Never been a Hugh Grant fan because he is almost always the same in everything he does so the novelty of the  English Fop has worn off for me. Tara Fitzgerald always plays the sexy girl and to be honest I have never been a fan of her acting style despite doing a good welsh accent. No this film for me which despite my criticism of the leads is one of my favorite movies because of its fantastic supporting cast. Colm Meaney is always good value and Ian Mcniece always adds quality to everything he does. However getting back to my opening statement it was Ian Hart's performance that moved me the most. It goes to prove that you don't have to have many lines or a leading role to turn in a masterful performance. In every scene he appeared in he just excelled. To portray someone who has suffered the horrors of the trenches of World War 1 is not easy and it would have been easy to overdo it but he doesn't. The scene on top of the mountain after the lightning strike where mentally he is transported back to the horrors of the trenches was truly moving. When Williams brings him back to the pub again despite what is going on with other characters and their dialog we are drawn to him. He truly owns the scene. In every scene that we see him in it is the haunted look that we see on his face in his eyes that truly captures the underlying theme of this movie  the desire for something good to come out of such hard times a community that has lost so much desperately trying to recapture its pride by ensuring Ffynnon Garw is retained as Wales first mountain. Johnny is one that came home when the rest of the villages young men are unlikely to. He is one that the village is trying to cling onto although most of the time he is just beyond their reach. He is there in the flesh but not truly in spirit. Pivotal moments  standing up and speaking about the trenches at the village meeting. I loved the Reverand Jones reaction to Johnny speaking  the tears in his eyes trying not to break down. Johnny is the one probably the only one in the village who is able to make the Reverand and Morgan the Goat set aside their differences. I loved the shot of Johnny after the breakdown when the voiceover speaks of the days of rain that followed. In one frame Hart perfectly captures the haunted and damaged young man that Johnny is. I loved it when Johnny tells the School teacher to  Stop acting so English and I absolutely ADORED Johnny's epiphany near the end of the movie where he decides it is time to stop being afraid and face his fear. The camera zooming right into him so that the entire screen is his. The village applauding his arrival to the top of the mountain was magical. One of their sons was home at last. He was finally back with them. Of course you could just see this movie as a heart warming comedy  and sure it can be enjoyed this way but I would urge all of you if not already to go back and watch it again from the perspective I have illustrated. As an actor Ian Hart is a master and in his portrayal as Johnny Shell Shocked a master is truly at work. Any aspiring actor would do well to get this man's entire back catalog on DVD to see how it ought to be done.".

	schema:headline " I don't want Ffynnon Garw to be on the map because we begged for it.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain is directed by Christopher Monger and written by Ivor Monger. It stars Hugh Grant Ian McNeice Tara Fitzgerald Colm Meaney and Kenneth Griffith. Music is by Stephen Endelman and cinematography by Vernon Layton.Set in 1917 plot finds Grant and McNeice as two English cartographers who arrive in the Welsh village of Ffynnon Garw to measure what the locals proudly proclaim to be Wales' first mountain. However it turns out that the mountain is 16 feet below the required 1000 feet requisite so therefore can only be classed as a hill. This news causes disgust amongst the locals who then set about stopping the cartographers going home whilst they attempt to build atop of the hill to make it over 1000 feet.A film with a big title that is matched by the size of its heart Monger's film owes much to those fun community based pictures that filed out of Ealing Studios back in the 40s and 50s Re Whisky Galore! and The Titfield Thunderbolt. We can also safely place it the whimsy category where something as wonderful as Local Hero sits while the old British comedy staple that encompasses an obsession with size The Mouse That Roared watches over the film like an approving British cinematic angel.Homespun humour marries up with the utterly engaging view of quirky village life to provide us with just under 100 minutes of entertainment.

	onyx:emotionText "The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain is directed by Christopher Monger and written by Ivor Monger. It stars Hugh Grant Ian McNeice Tara Fitzgerald Colm Meaney and Kenneth Griffith. Music is by Stephen Endelman and cinematography by Vernon Layton.Set in 1917 plot finds Grant and McNeice as two English cartographers who arrive in the Welsh village of Ffynnon Garw to measure what the locals proudly proclaim to be Wales' first mountain. However it turns out that the mountain is 16 feet below the required 1000 feet requisite so therefore can only be classed as a hill. This news causes disgust amongst the locals who then set about stopping the cartographers going home whilst they attempt to build atop of the hill to make it over 1000 feet.A film with a big title that is matched by the size of its heart Monger's film owes much to those fun community based pictures that filed out of Ealing Studios back in the 40s and 50s Re Whisky Galore! and The Titfield Thunderbolt. We can also safely place it the whimsy category where something as wonderful as Local Hero sits while the old British comedy staple that encompasses an obsession with size The Mouse That Roared watches over the film like an approving British cinematic angel.Homespun humour marries up with the utterly engaging view of quirky village life to provide us with just under 100 minutes of entertainment. Although clearly simple in plot and structure to simply dismiss it as such does not do justice to the fine work of the ensemble cast and the writing of Ivor and Chris Monger.

I was totally charmed by the movie from beginning to end. I couldn't help root for the village in their nonsensical quest and I was totally drawn in by their attempts to keep the cartographers around. This is a lighthearted movie but what it says about the horrible losses experienced by the UK in WWI and the sense of community of small towns in a simpler time gives the movie a stature that brings it far above a mere piece of fluff.This must be the only nonHistorychannel movie in existence with a cartographer as a lead role!! I just returned from a trip to England and I am married to a man who was a cartographer for many years so perhaps I was predisposed to like the movie. I also visited one of the vast British WWI cemeteries in northern France Etaples which moved me deeply. We Americans are woefully ignorant of the huge losses of promising young men that the British sustained during that war. The character Johnny Shellshocked in this movie gives but a hint of the horror and emotional damage sustained by those who survived. As with everything else in this movie it was handled with restraint and grace. Given what many of our own young people are experiencing today in Iraq that subplot may have extra resonance with many viewers.Fix yourself a cup of strong hot tea or a pint of ale adjust your ears to thick Welsh accent and sit back and enjoy an entertaining thoughtful little movie. If you give it a chance you may love it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is like THE LADY VANISHES and SO LONG AT THE FAIR  it is a film based on a story that has some plausibility and has been told many times but may be legendary.In 1917 two Englishman come to a Welch village. They are doing surveying work for the government to look over the mountains of Wales The village is proud of the mountain just behind it which for ages has been called the first great mountain of Wales. The two men measure the mountain and find it is 984 feet tall. Unfortunately it has been determined that mountains must be 1000 feet tall at least. So this mountain is not a mountain but a hill!Angry the villagers determine to try to undue this mistake. First they have to keep the Englishmen in the village long enough for a second measurement of the mountain to be made. Second they have to organize all the members of the village into working together to add some twenty feet to the hill and make it a mountain again.What follows is a comedy of clashing nationalities Welsh v. English particularly the obnoxious senior member of the surveying team George Ian MacNeice who constantly belittles the locals and who even says how much he hates them then why did he take this job one wonders. The nicer more amenable younger member of the team Anson Hugh Grant is willing to observe what the community wants to accomplish especially after he meets a local girl Betty Tara Fitzgerald. Led by the local publican Morgan the Goat Colm Meaney  from the various STAR TREK series the locals try to keep George occupied by disabling his car and lying about the local train service and giving him as much gin as he likes. Anson proves far less hostile and actually ends helping them.The Welsh are also split. Morgan is a wizard at organization but nobody trusts him. Least of all the local spiritual leader Rev. Jones Kenneth Griffiths. When the townspeople are building the mountain up the first time Jones notes that Morgan is making a mint out of selling beer to the parched men involved. Jones also has problems with the local schoolteacher the Anglophile Mr. Davies Garfield Morgan who does not think his little charges should have a day off  in order to help build up a mountain. The weather turns hostile with heavy rains. Time is running out. Will the locals turn the hill into a mountain or will they have to accept the hill is only a hill?Well made and funny and sad at one or two points when the effects of the war and the death of a leading character appear in the screenplay the movie is well worth watching and a definite 10 out of 10.".

Somewhere deep in Welshland a village nestles in tranquility amidst rolling hills and green pastures. There was this particularly large mound in the terrain and the villagers are proud to call it the mountain of Ffynnon Garw. Its the first mountain in Wales! remarks a villager.Hugh Grant cast as a English cartographer is tasked to measure the exact height of Ffynnan Garw and he bears unfortunate news to the villagers that Fynnan Garw at 980 feet is 20 feet shy to qualify as a mountain and hence won't appear in Her Majesty's Map.Now the Welsh are a proud race. One only needs to take a leaf from Ryan Giggs the Welsh soccer wizard who actually turned down playing for England in favour of Wales and missed out competing in the World Cup altogether.  On second thoughts he didn't miss much. England the soccer team stutters much like Hugh Grant the Englishman. The mere suggestion of Ffynnon Garw as a hill would have the villagers absolutely livid. The only thing worse than that is to have an Englishman tell them that.Springing into action the villagers decide to add twenty feet to the hill. It isn't such an easy task considering the village has most of its ablebodied young men fighting the Great War in France. It is up to the women and children to rally for this valiant effort. Hugh Grant and his superior a destestable Englishman with a huge potbelly and an even bigger head are anxious to move on. Other hills are waiting for them to be measured. That's when Tara Fitzgerald as an endearing village girl Betty enters the story to try to charm the cartographers into staying for a few more days. And just in case the Welsh make sure Grant's car was rendered useless and they were left stranded in the village of Ffynnon Garw with nothing more to do but to reassess its status as a hill.Grant plays his usual stuttering and apologetic self. While I felt his stuttering was way overdone he comes across as very likable and a seriously nice gentleman. Beneath his selfeffacing behaviour is a man who knows when to assert himself. There was this one and only time when faced with a medical emergency he actually orders his boss to bugger off. Bugger off is one endearing phrase he utters throughout his movie career if you haven't noticed. Tara Fitzgerald appears as the romantic interest of Grant. The little game of seduction she plays makes your heart yearn once more for the highschool romances that once were sweet and whimsical. Colm Meaney is memorable as Morgan the Goat the one magnetic personality who galvanises the village into action with his fiery ways and charms viewers with his cheeky ways.This is not a Grant vehicle. His vehicle would be About a Boy. If anything this is simply a vehicle for the Welsh fighting spirit which resides in the heart of every Welshman.Who should stay away  Those who abhor spending Sundays at the picnic those who can't stand Hugh Grant and Welsh people in the same vein as how Parisians stay away from Amelie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Others have described the plot of this film. I just add my praise to that of a few other reviewers who saw much more than the gentle comedy in The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill  The movie was filmed in Wales and gives us some nice scenic shots of the countryside with the mountainhill. But much of the enjoyment of this film is in the character studies. It so nicely gives us a look at several people and their Welshness. I can't say how folks from Wales may like the depictions but they are curious warm friendly and very real people shown in this film. All the acting is firstrate. Colm Meany and Kenneth Griffith play wonderfully off each other as pubowner Morgan the Goat and Reverend Jones respectively. Hugh Grant is very good in one of his most laid back comedy roles  here as a naturally shy young veteran from WW I. Tara Fitzgerald is very good as Betty. The rest of the cast make up a wonderful variety of different if not eccentric characters. This is not a comedy of riproaring laughter. It isn't loaded with sightgags or witty oneliners. There are a few clever lines but the comedy of this film is in the everyday lives of the people of this Welsh community and in the cunning to rouse the community to deal with a mountain of a problem. It is a very clean film suitable for all ages and audiences. As many others have noted it's a comedy of warmth that makes one feel good at its end. This film isn't for modern moviegoers who must have a constant flow of adrenalin. Or maybe it is  to help slow them down so they can learn to smell the roses along the way. Regarding the town's problem it's interesting that there don't seem to be any real set standards for designation of mountains versus hills. The sources I checked seem to agree that the difference is more in the degree of steepness rather than actual height. Funny though that the 1000foot mark of distinction seemed to come from the U.S. where the British favored more a 2000foot mark. The outside scenes of this movie were filmed at Gyrn Moelfre a hill or mountain in northeast Wales near the border with England. It has an elevation of 1716 feet above sea level. But it rises just 778 feet above the surrounding terrain. The movie shows people climbing the hill on a trail with switchbacks. Indeed climbing any hill of good size gives one the feel of having scaled a small mountain.The story came from one that director Christopher Monger heard from his grandfather about the village of Ffynnon Taf Taff's Well and it's nearby mountainhill Ffynnon Garw Garth Hill. It's located just a few miles north of Cardiff. But because of modern growth the movie was filmed further away in the middle of Wales near Liansilin.".

Supposedly based on a real story but probably not and set in 1917 it tells the story of two English cartographers Hugh Grant and Ian McNeice who arrive in a Welsh village in order to take the measure of the nearby mountain considered the pride of the locals. According to the height more specifically if it is higher than 1000 feet it will be determined whether it is indeed a mountain or it is just a hill. When the first measure turns out that it is just a few feet under the 1000 mark the anxious villagers will take action. In order to makes sure that it is recorded as a mountain they will transport dirt and soil from the fields and to the peak bucket by bucket. At the same time they will do everything to prevent the two cartographers from leaving town before they can take a second measure. Eventually Grant who falls in love with a local girl Tara Fitzgerald will help the villagers in their task the other cartographer is much more meaner and dismissive of the Welsh.

The idea was to convince the Russians that an attack couldn't possibly work that the thing really existed. That's why the Pentagon subsidized these things. The scripts were therefore friendly to military success at the end too.A solid third of this is from the department of defense no model planes here.Perry Mason the detecting lawyer was a literary phenomenon when this was made the books about him being outsold only by the Bible. And there was a very popular TeeVee show based on him. Perry's own detective was a guy played by the detective here. And his sidekick is a Della Street the third member of the gang lookalike. It was like having Indiana Jones appear. The effect is lost today but was quite something in the day.The third remarkable thing is what scares us. What we fear in our imagination is largely defined by movies. And what movies use to frighten us is tightly constrained by what they can show. In the fifties that was often disappearing or morphing things guys in rubber suits and small things made big by trick photography. Them was probably the first giant bug movie but it used real bugs. This is already a second generation using stop motion.The footage of Aleutians  borrowed from an older film  is great really great. Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".

And there was a very popular TeeVee show based on him. Perry's own detective was a guy played by the detective here. And his sidekick is a Della Street the third member of the gang lookalike. It was like having Indiana Jones appear. The effect is lost today but was quite something in the day.The third remarkable thing is what scares us. What we fear in our imagination is largely defined by movies. And what movies use to frighten us is tightly constrained by what they can show. In the fifties that was often disappearing or morphing things guys in rubber suits and small things made big by trick photography. Them was probably the first giant bug movie but it used real bugs. This is already a second generation using stop motion.The footage of Aleutians  borrowed from an older film  is great really great. Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.";

The story is very acceptable. I can't call it bad it is enjoyable for its faults and its good part.I would say it isn't as good as the thing from outer space 1951 I belief. But it has good moments basic fun giant monster movie moments and isn't that what you want. To be entertained. It could do with cutting out some slower passages it isn't as if these 50 movies really do allot with developing characters anyway. Some areas of this movie easily could be cut.

As far as films about giant insects go this one is pretty good and it's interesting to note that the mantis did not become a huge monster due to radioactive mutation it's just a dinosaur!

	schema:reviewBody "Curious breed these old school monster films. Lapped up by the kids of their time yet I can't imagine today's CGI glutted youth grooving to them talkative even educational weaving together dry facts ripe drama and a splash of romance and chuckles into their giant beast template. The Deadly Mantis is pretty much a textbook example of the genre and as such I can say right here that if you enjoy the creature features of the 1950's you could do well in looking up this one. The plot deals with an enormous preying mantis revived in the Arctic by human activity. The film diverges from the standard nuclear portents in its explanation in fact its explanation is a little fuzzy but it does tie into Cold War fears the human activity in question being the development of Arctic early warning radar. There are tussles tracks and development of mystery then just under half way through the mantis rears its ugly head and the film locks down to classic shenanigans delivering some nifty action a few nice chuckles and a satisfying tense finale. Director Nathan Juran keeps a steady hand on events fairly mastering the build up and release structure that sometimes undoes these films by opting less for destruction and more for journeying and pursuit. There is a little in the way of things being crushed or broken but the film never sets itself potential in those areas that it can't fulfil. The pacing is a little patchy though with the film suffering from a dusting of dry spells in the first two thirds that keep it from being really great. A bit of off humour as well but I didn't mind it so much as it comes with the territory. Acting is fair throughout everybody plays pretty standard roles but they fill them out nicely I never groaned at anyone though no one exactly sparkles. William Hopper makes for a good determined scientist and has a compelling intonation for proclaiming theories Craig Stevens Donald Randolph and others make for solid military men and Alix Taylor is an pleasing romantic interest. The cast work well together and have plenty of opportunity to do so one nice thing about this film typical of its type is that the characters work together they get along and once they realise what the enemy is they embark on taking it out no matter what. Not much more to say but it would be remiss of me to not mention the mantis itself. Its a terrific beast bug eyed winged fierce clawed and multi legged a fine looming antagonist. It doesn't look so hot in flying sequences but when on the ground its pretty darned ace. Definitely worth a look for 50's monster buffs as far as giant insects go its one of the best even if it wasn't put together with Harryhausen expertise. All in all its a film worth a shot then I certainly liked it and if you like this sort of thing you might well do too.".

It does have a lot of the clichs you'd expect in a flick like this military guys and scientists having meetings on what is going on screaming girl military guys whose jaws drop at the sight of a woman along with the 'wolf whistle' and more. But really in this case it's all actually pretty interesting even scenes where there's a good deal of chatting.The girl is pretty and she ends up with this lame military guy seemingly out of nowhere whereas beforehand she seemed pretty interested in her partner the guy who figured out it was a giant mantis doing all the mysterious damage. They had some good flirting scenes early on so her changing interests so easily seemed a bit odd.And the Mantis itself  despite the cheesy video cover the Mantis is actually very cool looking and just kinda pops up at one point out of some ice then it's action all the way. The FX are pretty darn good for the time especially when the Mantis flies and attacks various vehicles. And the roar is killer  this is one of the best monster roars in any movie. And the music is pretty spectacular always laying strong emphasis on the happenings on screen.After various attacks the Mantis makes its way to New York City and is smart enough not to go in the subway so he takes a car tunnel instead. One reviewer asked about a possible missing scene as we never actually see the Mantis enter the tunnel  it's the same on the DVD release. My guess is that they never filmed it. Truthfully the Mantis never really does much in NYC if anything at all  but my guess is probably that's because of budget restraints because really every scene with the Mantis is darn good why else would they seem to skimp.If you are fan of this stuff and have never watched The Deadly Mantis yet you won't regret it.

Shrewd and helpful paleontologist Dr. Nedrick Ned Jackson a lively and engaging performance by William Hopper joins forces with the military to find a way to stop the pesky critter. Director Nathan Juran working from a tight and straightforward script by Martin Berkeley relates the entertaining story at a steady pace does a nice job of creating a spooky and mysterious atmosphere in the opening third maintains a serious tone throughout and stages the monster attack scenes with real aplomb. This film further benefits from solid acting by an able cast with especially praiseworthy work by Alix Tilton as perky journalist Marge Blaine Craig Stevens as the stalwart Col. Joe Parkman Florenz Ames as the wise Prof. Anton Gunther and Donald Randolph as the nononsense General Mark Ford. The big bug looks pretty gnarly and the climax with the wounded oversized insect trapped in the Holland Tunnel is both tense and exciting. Ellis W. Carter's sharp cinematography makes neat occasional use of artful fades and dissolves. The robust score by Irving Getz and William Lava does the rousing trick. Best of all this movie has an earnest quality to it that's impossible to either dislike or resist. A very enjoyable creature feature.".

	schema:reviewBody "By the time the scifi shocker The Deadly Mantis premiered in May 1957 American audiences had already been regaled by a steady stream of giantmonster movies on the big screen starting with 1953's classic The Beast From 20000 Fathoms. In 1954 Them! with its monstrously large ants kicked off a subgenre of sorts the giantinsect movie and Tarantula would follow in 1955. After The Deadly Mantis The Beginning of the End giant grasshoppers Monster From Green Hell giant wasps Earth vs. the Spider and Attack of the Giant Leeches soon appeared to stun and amaze moviegoers. Unlike most of those other films however TDM featured a giant monster that was not the result of radioactive bombardment or an Hbomb blast but that was just naturally humongous a prehistoric entity released via natural phenomenon.In the film the viewer witnesses a volcanic eruption that takes place near Antarctica while our narrator intones the ominous words of Isaac Newton's Third Law of Motion For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. And implausibly enough this blowup near the South Pole soon triggers an earthquake near the North Pole almost 7900 miles away ! which releases.... Anyway cut to the intrepid men working at the polar DEW line where odd events soon begin to transpire. Colonel Joe Parkman Craig Stevens investigates the demolition of a weather station the downing of a C47 and some very odd tracks in the snow. Before long noted paleontologist Nedrick ! Jackson William Hopper who many viewers will recall from his roles in The Bad Seed and 20 Million Miles to Earth and museum reporter Marge Blaine Alix Talton a great screamer as it turns out join the colonel near the North Pole to join in the investigation and Jackson isn't long in getting to the bottom of things declaring In all the kingdom of the living there is no more deadly or voracious creature...than the praying mantis!Of all the giantmonster films mentioned above The Deadly Mantis is most reminiscent of The Beast From 20000 Fathoms the granddaddy of them all and in my humble opinion the greatest dinosaur movie ever made. Like the 1953 film it too opens in documentarylike fashion and with a dry scientific narration. The monster in both films is first observed as a radar blip near the North Pole and both pictures feature discussions regarding the thawedout mammoth remains that had recently been discovered in Siberia. In both films our prehistoric creature attacks a fishing trawler off the Canadian coast and is ultimately destroyed near a NYC landmark Manhattan Beach in the former in the depths of the Manhattan Tunnel in the latter. But whereas Beast had boasted the truly awesome stopmotion FX of the late Ray Harryhausen Mantis had to make do with FX of a lessercalibre more traditional kind. Still the creature looks impressive enough on the ground if a tad silly while in flight. The film contains at least four memorable sequences our first glimpse of the creature from below as it towers over a bunch of fleeing Greenlanders who swarm away in kayaks out to sea the creature's attack on the DEW station repulsed by both rifle fire and flamethrower the mantis' ascent of the Washington Monument and finally that Manhattan Tunnel windup as Parkman and his men toss 3RG chemical mines at the mantis in an already densely foggy environment. This denouement might bring to mind the storm drain finale in Them! For once the use of stock footage is well integrated the footage used is crisp and clean and actually looks as though it had been shot for the film in question. Surprisingly the first 13 of The Deadly Mantis before we even get a glimpse of our monster might be the film's best section an Arctic tour de force according to the Maltin Classic Movie Guide slowly building suspense in an intelligent manner against its snowbound backdrop. The picture has been surprisingly well directed by Nathan Juran although perhaps it is unfair of me to use the word surprisingly Juran after all would go on to helm such cult favorites as 20 Million Miles to Earth released just one month later The Brain From Planet Arous Attack of the 50 Foot Woman The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad AND First Men in the Moon those last two WOULD benefit from Harryhausen's participation. TDM also features a love triangle of sortsseemingly obligatory in many of these '50s scifi filmsthat is a tad surprising as pretty Marge does NOT wind up with the guy you might be expecting. In all a satisfying nicely realized and intelligent monster movie and perfect fare for viewing with your 8yearold nephew of course.Further good news regarding The Deadly Mantis is that it comes to us today as part of Universal Studios' Classic SciFi Ultimate Collection and is presented via a pristinelooking print. On the same DVD disc can be found the film The Land Unknown another BW scifi outing from 1957 that also strangely enough clocks in at precisely 78 minutes and showcases prehistoric monsters in a polar setting. A perfect double feature both films come highly recommended by this viewer an admitted sucker for 1950s scifi. And speaking of that decade back in the 1950s and '60s I am old enough to recall a NYC urban legend had it that there was a 1000 fine for killing any praying mantis. Well I'm sorry to report baby boomers that this popular myth just had no basis in reality beneficial as these harmless little insects might be. Beneficial harmless and little...three words surely that would NOT describe our deadly mantis....".

	schema:reviewBody "As far as UniversalInternationals' genre output of the 1950s goes The Deadly Mantis is engaging escapism if not on the level of the classics of the period like It Came from Outer Space The Creature from the Black Lagoon and This Island Earth. It's based on a story by producer William Alland who'd probably been brainstorming on species of insects  arachnids that had yet to be enlarged and unleashed on various unlucky humans.The praying mantis makes for an effective antagonist in this formulaic but still likable and enjoyable movie. It's unleashed from a frozen tomb in the Arctic and goes on the expected rampage steadily making its way South towards a more tropical climate. Identifying the beast is eminent paleontologist Nedrick Jackson William Hopper and hoping to destroy it are Colonel Joe Parkman Craig Stevens and General Mark Ford Donald Randolph.There is an obligatory dose of romantic material here as Joe strikes up some chemistry with Neds' associate Marge Blaine Alix Talton a magazine editor looking for a big story but it doesn't really ever intrude on the action too much. Just like many other genre films of the period The Deadly Mantis goes for a semidocumentary style educating the audience on the radar fences spread throughout Canada and the short lived Ground Observer Corps a real life group of citizens that had been instructed on how to spot and identify various forms of aircraft.The result is quite a bit of talk although there is still enough good praying mantis action to make the movie diverting. The special effects are mostly pretty decent with the rampaging insect coming off as formidable enough and definitely not easy to take down. The story is also not without a sense of humour as we see Joes' fellow servicemen going gaga over the attractive Marge seeing as how they encounter members of the opposite sex so infrequently.The efficient direction is by Nathan Juran a busy filmmaker of the period whose other credits include 20 Million Miles to Earth The Brain from Planet Arous Attack of the 50 Foot Woman and The 7th Voyage of Sinbad.All things considered The Deadly Mantis offers up a fair amount of fun for fans of this kind of thing.Seven out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yep so 1957 was most definitely the year of the big bug thriller movie talk about over kill! After the huge success of 'Them!' in 1954 the genre was alive and kicking followed closely by the excellent 'Tarantula' in 1955. Since that explosion of insectoid goodness studios at the time were systematically going through every known bug they could to make a horror scifi. Any bug that could be transformed into a huge slimy fanged beastie was slapped up on the screen.This third movie from the era I think third? as you can clearly tell is all about the exploits of a giant Praying Mantis cos they look scary right! A volcano erupts as they frequently do in these films which in turn causes the Polar region to shift and break apart which in turn releases a giant Mantis that had been trapped in the ice for millions of years. Cue the Mantis running around and eating lots of stereotypical military types until it can be trapped and killed with extreme yet polite prejudice.Now far be it for me to take the pss too much but...holy tentacles this was a fun flick! Yes that's right you thought I was gonna sht all over it didn't you well hold on. OK so the plot is ridiculous and virtually a carbon copy of every other big bug movie ever made. A natural disaster releases the monster bug or its the result of some kind of experiment either or. From there on its the simple process of watching a predictable trio of a good looking bloke an attractive female and an old intelligent scientist type discussing tactics to destroy the bug whilst others get eaten. Then eventually they manage to succeed but not before many innocent faceless people have perished everyone's a winner.The film initially starts out like a documentary for schools or some kind of news reel. It goes on for for at least 56 minutes about the military and how they are building this base in northern Canada with all these early warning barriers that cross the entire country. Its all your typical Cold war malarkey in case the Ruskies attack via the Poles. But this intro goes on and on I started to wonder if I had the right thing playing. Anyway the big question is of course how the hell did a giant Mantis get trapped in ice or whatever it was before it was ice at the Poles where ever it was before it was the Poles and manage to survive for millions of years. Although I guess a bigger question would be how the hell did a Mantis get to be giant in the first place.The main attraction of this movie is of course the giant Mantis and the way the effects team created it. Overall its a bloody good rubber bug puppet and model combination it actually looks like a genuinely real Mantis of epic proportions with all the correct details and shape. More importantly it looks quite scary and intimidating it does actually lend some genuine scary atmosphere to the proceedings when it lurks in the background. A lot of that is down to the correct shape of the insect with its long thin pointy jagged sharp looking legs the eerie sound it makes and those two big silver emotionless eyes. The short sequences of the bug flying are also well realised the only downside with this and much like all giant bug movies the bug roars like a flippin' dinosaur or Godzilla. The best sequence on show has to be the quick scene where the Mantis climbs up the Washington Monument that actually looks really good all things considered.The movie takes on a very King Kongesque approach as the Mantis eventually makes it way to New York after fighting off some jet fighters along the way ahem! copyright. To avoid a complete rip off the big bug ends up crawling into the Manhattan Tunnel to recover this in fact leads to a sequence where a group of blokes go in after the bug all dressed up in biohazard type suits. This one scene actually reminded me of many modern scifi movies. A group of characters all suited up in special outfits creeping down a dark space with flashlights all culminating in the heroic final group pose shot when they find the creature. This whole sequence was probably the slickest in the movie and gave it some real gravitas. Alas the ending lets everything down with such a weak clichd display of male chauvinism as the male lead virtually bullies the female into kissing him...right next to the huge dead bug. Its like they just killed it and that turned them on or him sadistic tendencies.As always plenty of good and bad to be found the small Eskimo village sequence is probably the daftest and most amusing. And I still can't work out how no one thinks to shoot this thing in the eyes it has two huge silver eyes shoot those surely pretty sure that would stop it straight away. Anyway despite the odd little expected flaws this is still a solid bug flick and easily one of the best in my opinion.7.510".

Ghostbusters Summer Rental The Great Outdoors Strange Brew Gung Ho Mr. Mom all of these movies have their place but none of them can match Weird Science for laughs or pure....eightiesness. Yes eightiesness is a quality. It's a corny dated quality but one that is tangible and valued by my fellow eighties loving brethren to this day. Come back with me if you will to a time when Anthony Michael Hall was still fielding calls and Kelly LeBrock was French for sexy.Weird Science has everything that an eighties comedy needs A least one hot girl a few actors who are no longer working or who do anything that will come along plenty of dashing eighties threads a corny as hell eighties soundtrackand Oingo Boingo is as corny and eighties as they get and plenty of cheap funny jokes. Undoubtedly the best thing about Weird Science is Bill Paxton who plays Wyatt's older brother Chet. Chet is the worst big brother ever to grace a movie screen and is a role model for all big brothers everywhere me included. Chet delights in extorting money and valuables from Wyatt in exchange for his silence about Wyatt's activities. The best part in the movie is when Chet gets turned into the toad thing or whatever it is. Man I love that part. The rest of the cast does a good job of being their stock characters. Kelly LeBrock does a good job of being hot. Robert Downey Jr. shows none of the signs of future drug addiction. The film is unremarkable in the fact that it isn't anything groundbreaking or special. It's just a funny movie. And an eighties classic. Bottom Line If you grew up in the eighties and you never saw Weird Science then you must atone for your crimes by going out and buying it right now. Then send me an email telling me how grateful you are that I put you on the path to rightousness and eighties correctness.".

	schema:reviewBody "80s! I'm living in the 80s! If you love 80s teen movies then Weird Science ought to be in your catalogue. It is one of director John Hughes most memorable and one of the 80s most original.Written in two days this is a teen science fiction film the story of two teenage loners Wyatt the always grimacing IlanMitchell Smith and Gary Anthony Michael Hall before he went deadpan and their weird way of discovering girls. A variation on Frankenstein the teenagers create a beautiful woman the super cool Kelly LeBrock using their computer and some clever hacking skills of course it's exaggerated. Their creation is Lisa the chic English accent woman who brings a little life to the subtle Illinois suburb. As the antithesis of both Wyatt and Gary's personalities she's going to show these boys a little adventure get them to loosen up and for crying out loud gain some selfesteem.Because Lisa is a lady with some supernatural power like freezing grandparents in time erasing the memory of a bad first impression with Gary's parents turning Wyatt's obnoxious military school brother Chet Bill Paxton in his funniest most arrogant role yet into a giant pus maggot or even having a gang of mutant bikers storming a house party. And Lisa's greatest gift to the boys showing them true love by helping them along to meet the two girls they've been after all along their high school classmates Deb and Hilly who are unfortunately hung up on the dweeb bullies Max Robert Russler and Ian Robert Downey Jr.. So essentially it deals with many aspects of teen angst but more like just teen selfesteem or selfconsciousness issues within one story. Parents class status done subtly here as opposed to Some Kind of Wonderful or Pretty in Pink relationships etc. It works well and is done quite humorously.One of my favorite scenes is when the trio Lisa Gary and Wyatt go to the night club looking pretty out of place they're not only the only white people there but probably the only ones under thirty. Once Anthony Michael Hall's character Gary gets drunk and starts with his slang it's hilarious. Reminds me a little of Adventures in Babysitting when the gang drops in on the club and they're not allowed to leave until they sing. So eventually they loosen up and have a little fun.It's a wonderful movie with a classic John Hughes comic touch says the mutant biker to Gary and Wyatt after they threaten to kill them if they don't leave Please don't tell anyone about this. I'd hate to lose my teaching job.. Plus it's got a great soundtrack featuring Killing Joke Lords of the New Church and Oingo Boingo doing the title song. The music video for it was fantastic and not only features clips from the movie but Kelly LeBrock herself in Oingo Boingo's own rendition of creating the woman via technology. Although not one of John Hughes' best I think Sixteen Candles is still his greatest it is certainly one of his most memorable and one that I will love no matter how old I get. So have yourself a lazy Saturday pop in the movie and enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Weird Science is the product of the prolific '80s' writerdirector John Hughes who later went on to create films such as 'Home Alone'.

Weird Science epitomises the 80s with its fast cars shoulder pads and big hair. To be honest Weird Science is synonymous with that decade and reflects most if not all of its hopes and aspirations computers in every home robotic servants etc.. Looking back on it now it's incredibly dated however and more importantly the film is still as entertaining today as it was over ten years ago!Anyone who grew up in the 80s and is beginning to reminisce will instantly relate to the exploits of the two lead characters Gary Anthony Michael Hall and Wyatt Ilan MitchellSmith as they use their computer and associated paraphernalia to create a beautiful girlfriend Kelly LeBrock. Although not Hughes' best work this was reserved in my opinion for the later 'Ferris Beuller's Day Off' which was far more appealing to a wider audience  Weird Science will always be a 'Geeky' 80s classic. The film was so popular it spawned it's own TV series  ten years later!Unless you lived through that decade the film won't touch you in quite the same way. You needed to have been in awe of Tron to have worn stone washed jeans and to have owned at least two pairs of illuminous odd socks to really appreciate the naivety of the main characters as they place their faith in computers and 'modern' technology.Today to a younger  more clued up audience Weird Science could get lost amongst so many other 80s flicks with inferior technology and  visual special FX to today's CGI standards. However there is something quintessentially 80s something oh so Duran Duran about Weird Science that separates it from even the best of today's films. It's that central 'Hughes' element with its visual nuances and audible gags that makes this a timeless classic watchable again and again.If you know what 'ghetto blaster' is definitely watch this film if you were born after 1984 take everything with a pinch of salt and pay attention  you might learn something.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure how many people really read these reviews in IMDb but if there are people out there like me that enjoy this forum quite a bit then they will know that I have loved Bill Paxton's work forever.  I can tell you he was in Stripes and he was one of the punks in Terminator and he even had a small role in Commando.  His three best films in my opinion are True Lies Aliens and his classic turn as Chet in Weird Science.  Anyone that has seen this film will tell you that they loved it when Chet comes home to find it snowing in his room.  Or how fun it was to watch him torture Wyatt by extorting money from him.  For Christ sakes Wyatt will you cover yourself!   Bill Paxton may be best known for his work in James Cameron films but it is John Hughes that we have to thank for unleashing him onto audiences with this amazing turn as Chet Donnelly.  He is the meanest nastiest older brother and yet he is screamingly funny.  Bill Paxton had a cameo in a film called The Last Supper years later and his character really could have been a grown up Chet.  But it is here that we get to laugh at some of Paxton's best work.  Weird Science is one hell of a funny film and John Hughes is responsible for that but if Chet wasn't played by Bill Paxton then it just wouldn't have been the same.As the film goes it is quite good.  I don't believe it is Hughes' best that honour in my opinion goes to The Breakfast Club but it is very very entertaining.  And as one reviewer said before me you had to have grown up in the 80's to really appreciate this film.  And underneath all of what this film is about it is still just a film about the insecurities of being a teen getting the girl and living happily ever after.  I think Hughes may have been writing the script for Sixteen Candles stopped in the middle of it and then took acid with Chevy Chase or John Candy and then came up with this idea because some of the situations really are right out of nowhere. Take for example the actual creation of Lisa.  The two geeks hook up a doll to the game of Operation?? and then with bras around their heads they connect the computer and then lightning and winds invade their room and then Kelly LeBrock walks out of their closet.  Acid for sure.Then there is the scene with Vernon Wells and his biker buddies.  A highschool house party and then a bunch of guys on motorcycles straight out of Mad Max breaks into the house and starts to terrorize the kids.  Acid trip for sure.  Acid aside Weird Science is a trip through time.  If you were born in the 70's and went to highschool in the 80's like I did then you are probably familiar with the name John Hughes and if you are then you are probably a fan of most of his work.  Along with Ferris Sixteen Candles Breakfast Club and some of his adult films like Planes Trains... She's Having a Baby and even Vacation Weird Science is a film that should be seen again.  It is 15 years old and perhaps people can say it is dated some but to me it is a throwback to what films were like in the 80's.  This film is fun hysterical and enjoyable.  And it has Bill Paxton in one of the funniest roles in any career.  This is a fun film and if you haven't seen this in quite some time then maybe you should.8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Does a movie need definitive plot points or events that move the characters forward? No! Weird Science proves that a movie need be nothing more than a series of jokes and visual gags. But Weird Science is also a movie with a message. That message  horny boys and science is a wicked combination. Once you see John Hughes' masterpiece about Frankensex you will be asking yourself why you ever quoted The Breakfast Club. I sense you doubting that Weird Science effectively taps into the troubled teen psyche with sincerity and insight. Well consider the following. A bodacious babe is front and center with Einstein's intellect and essence of David Lee Roth. A teenage girl is stripped naked by a vacuum cleaner chimney  which is okay cuz it's in the name of science. Bill Paxton is reduced to a Jim Hensonesque troll! A giant phallic missile penetrates a suburban house. Still not convinced? Well just watch the last half hour. A gang of road ragers crashes the obligatory 80s teen party do donuts all over the floors and smack random guys in the crotch. Bennet from Commando asks the heroes if they have tossed off to any good books lately and Anthony Michael Hall get's all Dirty Harry on their uninvited post apocalypse asses. This is a work of unparalleled brilliance and sophistication. It's got Robert Downey Jr. in it too!".

	schema:reviewBody "Even when John Hughes makes a mediocre film such as Weird Science the nature of his intent still shines through to the point where you can't necessarily fault him for anything except not making a better one. Weird Science serves as the ultimate 1980s high school nerd fantasy one in which babes see social awkwardness as a turnon and bullies and extortionist older brothers help themselves to large servings of humble pie. The movie truly doesn't need to be anything more even in spite of the shallowness of its characters and general disregard for logic.Anthony Michael Hall in his fourth Hughes film in three years and Ilan MitchellSmith star as two losers who determine that if they can't get girls the oldfashioned way that they can use their computer smarts to play Frankenstein and create the ideal woman. After some illegal hacking they pack her with a high IQ and an appropriate breast size then hook a doll up to a machine. One crazy storm inside their house later and suddenly there's Lisa Kelly LeBrock who's every bit as stunning with a type A personality as a nerd could possibly imagine or desire.The story then goes the unexpected route. Lisa equipped with mad street smarts and magic powers literally takes over the driver's seat and the young Gary and Wyatt for a wild ride. After helping them loosen up a bit she determines they need a few tests to find the courage they need to stand up to bullies and go after the girl.Hughes determines that Lisa needs no rhyme or reason other than causing an appropriate amount of mischief so the boys can learn a valuable thing or two. She's the fairy godmother of this fantasy it's one thing to stand up to your parents for example and tell them you're going to a party and it's another to have a hot model do it for you and cause your father to forget who you are. Hughes basically sticks it to everyone who made his life crappy during his teens though to be fair he recognizes the nerd's shortcomings and doesn't paint them as heroes. Hughes has always played things close to the chest filming most of his movies in the Chicago suburbs where he grew up even naming the high school in Weird Science after the main road where his actual high school was. In this film he has absolute loony fun with his usual tropes going as far as turning Bill Paxton who plays Wyatt's militaristic older brother Chet into a steaming pile of crap that looks like Jabba the Hut.Fans of the more romantic side of Hughes who love his candid nature toward portraying high schoolers might find Weird Science to be the wild mutt of the family with its irreverence and high level of silliness. It could be considered the cult favorite of the Hughes collection and that's fine. It definitely caters to those who can relate to being a socially outcast teenage boy and not too many others but by no means is it a slipup for the comingofage master.

However Weird Science is in the bottom of this list for sure.I didn't feel anything that comic. Maybe the scene with the kid talking in the bar like an old drunken lover. Everything is swift and not in a solid way. The movie is sometimes sluggish and all the time poor. The imagination isn't crazy enough and the solutions are so easy the guys will be brave by facing some mad max bikers who appear suddenly ?? the hard brother will be softer by turning into a huge disgusting frog ??... Simply the hastiness ruled. Let alone that the fake frog's level was awful the dealing with the grandfathers was mean and even Kelly LeBrock looked not amusing enough or sexy enough.Nothing by John Hughes was as low as this ever. To tell you the truth I was thinking for most of the time that this was a work of copycats doing a bad job at it too. Nonetheless the performance couple of lines plus some real wacky moments when the imagination is fresh saved the day. Almost saved it!I think the deep innocent tone of it the wisdom of she is all what I wanted of a woman before knowing the woman I wanted and the showing of some teenagers' dreams so dreamy were the good points that may ensure a place in us to respect or even love the movie. Add to that the effective sense of nostalgia which doesn't come from the 1980s fact only but from what happened to the teen comedies after being mucous seminal and emetic. So compared to them Weird Science is the morning cartoon ! However this time I felt that these dirty comedies got something I don't know what maybe more interesting than what this 80s comedy got. It could be the polished look teenagerlike leads more than kids a sexual boldness or funny stuff?? Generally  Naive fun but naively made. A melted ice cream.

Basically two nerdy teenage boys Gary Wallace The Breakfast Club's Anthony Michael Hall and Wyatt Donnelly Ilan MitchellSmith are desperate to be liked and of course sexobsessed and in their desperation inspired by watching  a coloured version of  Frankenstein 1931 they decide to create the perfect woman. They weren't counting on the computer gaining so much power it would actually make their woman a reality but it happens and Lisa Kelly LeBrock is determined to help them have a good time. Lisa who can get absolutely anything she wants e.g. expensive cars mutant bikers to appear has a purpose to turn them into men by putting them in a couple of situations to boost their confidence and they are on the road to becoming accepted by others. Of course it is at the big party they always wanted they meet the girls they would have always wanted and Lisa's job is done. Also starring Bill Paxton as Chet Donnelly Suzanne Snyder as Deb Judie Aronson as Hilly young Robert Downey Jr. as Ian Robert Rusler as Max Commando's Vernon Wells as Lord General Britt Leach as Al Wallace Barbara Lang as Lucy Wallace Ivor Barry as Henry Donnelly Ann Coyle as Carmen Donnelly and the original Hills Have Eyes' Michael Berryman as Mutant Biker. LeBrock is obviously very attractive and there are one or two amusing moments but the comedy is pretty crass but it was interesting to see younger Paxton and especially future star Downey Jr. in a film of this sort. It was number 42 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Okay!".

Basically two nerdy teenage boys Gary Wallace The Breakfast Club's Anthony Michael Hall and Wyatt Donnelly Ilan MitchellSmith are desperate to be liked and of course sexobsessed and in their desperation inspired by watching  a coloured version of  Frankenstein 1931 they decide to create the perfect woman. They weren't counting on the computer gaining so much power it would actually make their woman a reality but it happens and Lisa Kelly LeBrock is determined to help them have a good time. Lisa who can get absolutely anything she wants e.g. expensive cars mutant bikers to appear has a purpose to turn them into men by putting them in a couple of situations to boost their confidence and they are on the road to becoming accepted by others. Of course it is at the big party they always wanted they meet the girls they would have always wanted and Lisa's job is done. Also starring Bill Paxton as Chet Donnelly Suzanne Snyder as Deb Judie Aronson as Hilly young Robert Downey Jr. as Ian Robert Rusler as Max Commando's Vernon Wells as Lord General Britt Leach as Al Wallace Barbara Lang as Lucy Wallace Ivor Barry as Henry Donnelly Ann Coyle as Carmen Donnelly and the original Hills Have Eyes' Michael Berryman as Mutant Biker. LeBrock is obviously very attractive and there are one or two amusing moments but the comedy is pretty crass but it was interesting to see younger Paxton and especially future star Downey Jr. in a film of this sort. It was number 42 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Okay!";

The mastermind behind the conceptual excellence of skiving school to live in Ferris Bueller's day off to the film that showcased how teenagers really felt about their suffocating parents in the Breakfast club the man seemed to have his knowledge spot on regarding teenage life.What emerges is a pretty standard and very degrading depiction of lonely lust containing two teenagers who are the good guys but are hard pushed to maintain that.Anthony Michael Hall a hero from the Breakfast Club feels repetitive and loud in another role for Hughes. MitchellSmith likewise feels weak and a stereotype of high school repression and against Hall we have the most conventional and boring comedy duo ever mastered which is a great shame for a director and writer who also created some of the best teenage comedy ever.The premise for the story sounds promising two lads attempt to break science through some technological mastery in an attempt to fulfil their lust on a weekend away from their parents.So after some degrading and embarrassing perversion by the lead duo on cheerleaders and a head turner away from dropped pants do the duo retreat to their sanctuary and form an hyperbole of illogical science to fulfil their uses and gratifications. Through some fast flowing wires and a bemused science guard to the pair get their just deserts.One thing John Hughes usually does perfectly is introductions and Kelly LeBrock's opening shot is the equivalent of Megan Fox in Transformers a slow panning from her legs upwards in a small Barbie styled costume a beautiful introduction which is maintained through the nest few scenes as she jumps into the shower with the two lads uses provocative gestures such as late drinking and kissing practice to keep any horny male teenager hooked.Certainly LeBrock hits the nail on the head acting flirtatious and forward to justify her character as perfect female until the inevitable outcome the plot always has in mind there is more to a person than looks tag.Through some careful shots and repetitive music we see the story pan out as any other romantic comedy would and there are minimal surprises to generate a good watch particularly when the humour is gross out and shamefully degrading to the actors.The final nail in the coffin is the change in personalities of the final act and as predictable as the coming of next year will have you shaking your head.Certainly not too much consequence came from this film as there were Ferris Bueller's amongst others to follow and create a reputation of teenage comedy mastery.".

All the crashing yelling and screaming grew so tedious by the end that I was left wondering why I didn't flick it off half way through. I guess I was expecting something genuinely funny or interesting to happen. I don't think it should matter that I saw this movie 21 years after it came out because The Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller's Day Off were superb films made within a year of Weird Science.

Charlize Theron gave a better performance than her Devil's advocate role although they had the same criteria the disturbed wife. But her genuine agonizing performance distinguished her in this movie.I noticed the music was a major pillar in this movie it was like another main character in this movie the editing was great also especially the scene in the subway. The story was an original also it had good turn ups and twists.The movie had all the right elements in general and it certainly doesn't deserve a 4.7 on the imdb. I think the voters were greatly disappointed after seeing all those good elements destroyed by the cheesy and typical ending that only producers could have had a part with in order to make another sequel.The ending by all means was bad it destroyed the originality of the story and the tension build up. I give it an 7.5 for all the good elements it would reached a 9.0 if the ending was different.".

Bizarre episodes begin to occur with Alex leaving Jillian suspicious of her husband's condition.

We have imaginative and potentially suspenseful ideas with this film's concepts behind such happenings in two minutes as Spencer and Alex are in galactic boundaries. The gradual increase in Spencer's unusual behavior depicts effective suspensebut thorough introduction of the characters does not take place nor do we witness the key events in which the rest of the move hinges upon. Consequently The Astronaut's Wife does not work.The film's first act is full of incidences characters and subplots. Clearly too many things happen too early in the story. Within the first thirty minutes the production attempts to develop two separate relationships shows us the atmosphere of a teacher's workplace something bizarre transpires out of earth's orbit a decision is made to resign and move to New York a suicide takes place a character mysteriously dies and probably  more. I just couldn't follow the plot.I liked the eerie supernatural overtones located throughout the production. The film is smart to reveal the right amounts of information at the precise time. There is also a certain style to The Astronaut's Wife containing an elusive mood a weirdly intriguing design and some tense and unusual camera angles. The movie becomes more interesting as we reach the closing.Charlize Theron has been in a lot of movies lately but The Astronaut's Wife is her first leading role. She seems to have come out of left field in 1997 with the comedy Trail and Error. Afterwards she contributed larger performances in The Devil's Advocate Celebrity Mighty Joe Young and most recently The Cider House Rules and Reindeer Games. Her role in The Astronaut's Wife is a little more complex than her past credits excluding her enticing and believable acting job in The Devil's Advocate. She presents the traumatized Jillian Armacost with the perfect blend of zest and tragic confusion. Depp and Theron conjure a chemistryrich couple. The movie very clearly takes Jillian's point of view instead of allowing us to know mysteries with Spencer. This stays consistent and focused but sometimes leaves us pondering about unexplained events.  The Astronaut's Wife builds for an aweinducing conclusion through revealing and intriguing dialogue and an omnipresent undertone. The film suggests a form of extraterrestrial is behind the deaths of several characters as well as the strange behavior of Spencer but we learn the truth  only in the end. Call The Astronaut's Wife an unusual The X Files episode featuring a cliffhanger conclusion and a supernatural climax. The movie must have appeared really exciting on script. If only more capable filmmakers would have claimed this production we may have had a real winner. Instead audiences feel disappointment and failure potential is wasted and originality is underscored".

What we have here is predictable situations sudden appearances a mysterious loss of electricity which turns out to be nothing to do with aliens  duh!

What is apparent to even the most braindead viewer very early on is guarded as a topsecret surprise by a director who thinks that he is the only one who sawread dozens of similar moviesnovelscomics about aliens taking over human bodies. One of the more ludicrous scenes is when Theron refuses to listen to the black exNASA guy I mean there she was wondering all the time what the hell is wrong with Depp and when finally someone approaches her with potential answers to the Depp riddle that preoccupy her so she decides not to listen to him. Duh. She is constantly crying worrying sweating with anxiety but never really does anything intelligent to fight the alien beast. She is therefore annoying. And it's ohso convenient of Ravich to make Theron have a mentalpatient past so that  very conveniently  no one will believe her when she expresses any kind of misgivings about Depp and his intentions. It's like the kid or the drunk whom no one believes when they see an alien UFO. What a brilliant plot device! It's straight out of the Idiot's Guide To Making Lousy Movies With Awfully Annoying Dumb Clich Plot Points. Depp is neither menacing nor interesting he is simply bland and this is his worst role yet. Plus I don't see why he has to talk like he just left a Tennessee farmhouse for the first time since his Maw and Paw brought him to this world. Apart from the obvious annoying things that I mentioned the film somehow manages to be continuously irritating and I can't quite put my finger on what it is that makes this film almost icky perhaps it's Depp or perhaps it's just bad direction  something intagible. The ending is one big nothing she kills Depp and the alien enters her. How brilliant! And then we are shown Theron some years later  finally with some hair on her head  with the evil alien twins going to school while listening to alien sounds on their walkmans. Big deal. Casting Charlize Themoron who once infamously said how much she enjoyed Budapest when in Turkey is ideal for this dumb movie.If this movie could talk it would say that Budapest was in Turkey.".

	schema:headline " An insult";
	schema:reviewBody "There is scene in this movie in which a stroke is medically referred to as a severe insult to the brain. A line which describes this entire film far better than any reviewer possibly could.Obviously influenced by The XFiles the first thing that strikes the viewer is the invasive use of tense mood music. If the Astronaut's Wife is opening a fridge there is a string quartet behind anxiously heralding a danger which subsequently doesn't exist. In a TV show like The XFiles it's a trick used to great affect because it's stylistic and the shows exhibit a degree of wit and imagination that relieve us from the pointless tension. Neither of those saving graces feature in this film.The characters are poorly drawn we're constantly told Spencer The Astronaut has changed since his last mission into space. We need to be told this so often because we're deprived of witnessing very much of his prior personality. And throughout the story Jillian The Wife never functions as anything more than a paranoid wreck even before she suspects that something is really wrong.Fans of Depp and Theron will be as disappointed as the rest of us. Johnny's flyboy astronaut is utterly out of place since we all know true spacemen are stiff and boring scientists yet this guy is exhuberant like the barnstorming 1950's test pilots that never really existed. God only knows what hewas thinking with this part. And Charlize throughout she never lifts above the catatonic. Literally and I mean this folks there is nothing more to her performance than the bags under her eyes and hers is the lead character our heroine for crying out loud! That's beyond appalling.As a thriller there is never a comfort break in this pretentious scifi flick that asks us to care for a character it's impossible engage with. It's nonstop we're expected to be in the edge of our seat with every single scene and if the plot doesn't supply the drama a 'bus' that's the Hollywood term for a false shock will. They are countless and soon annoying. The same can be said for the way The Wife is mysteriously at the front of every crowd during key moments of action which is one of the other cheap dramatic tricks overused by a really really bad director.Until recently writerdirector Rand Ravich hadn't been in charge of a film since this 1999 failure you'll know why.Fifteen years ago this was the kind of film that made a frustrated Quentin Tarantino decide he really needed to begin making his own. It's diabolical.".

A line which describes this entire film far better than any reviewer possibly could.Obviously influenced by The XFiles the first thing that strikes the viewer is the invasive use of tense mood music. If the Astronaut's Wife is opening a fridge there is a string quartet behind anxiously heralding a danger which subsequently doesn't exist. In a TV show like The XFiles it's a trick used to great affect because it's stylistic and the shows exhibit a degree of wit and imagination that relieve us from the pointless tension. Neither of those saving graces feature in this film.The characters are poorly drawn we're constantly told Spencer The Astronaut has changed since his last mission into space. We need to be told this so often because we're deprived of witnessing very much of his prior personality. And throughout the story Jillian The Wife never functions as anything more than a paranoid wreck even before she suspects that something is really wrong.Fans of Depp and Theron will be as disappointed as the rest of us. Johnny's flyboy astronaut is utterly out of place since we all know true spacemen are stiff and boring scientists yet this guy is exhuberant like the barnstorming 1950's test pilots that never really existed. God only knows what hewas thinking with this part. And Charlize throughout she never lifts above the catatonic. Literally and I mean this folks there is nothing more to her performance than the bags under her eyes and hers is the lead character our heroine for crying out loud! That's beyond appalling.As a thriller there is never a comfort break in this pretentious scifi flick that asks us to care for a character it's impossible engage with. It's nonstop we're expected to be in the edge of our seat with every single scene and if the plot doesn't supply the drama a 'bus' that's the Hollywood term for a false shock will. They are countless and soon annoying. The same can be said for the way The Wife is mysteriously at the front of every crowd during key moments of action which is one of the other cheap dramatic tricks overused by a really really bad director.Until recently writerdirector Rand Ravich hadn't been in charge of a film since this 1999 failure you'll know why.Fifteen years ago this was the kind of film that made a frustrated Quentin Tarantino decide he really needed to begin making his own. It's diabolical.";

Makes you tense like any thriller should makes you wait what turns out. Some compare it to Rosemary's baby but from the space although I think I know where this comparison comes from I strongly disagree.

	schema:reviewBody "I have to say I always enjoy Johnny Depp's work. He is a chameleon an actor who can take literally any role who can step outside the boundaries of typecasting. And his performance in this film is in no way weaker than any other character it is merely a role that not many are likely to recall when asked about him. The film builds decently enough. Depp and Theron play a married couple and a significant element of stress begins to grow on Theron following Depp's events during an orbital assignment given to his character.I also like Charlize Theron my one nitpick is how she seems to always find her way into these 'tormented woman' roles like in the Devil's Advocate. Her skills are not necessarily hindered by this repetitiveness I just find it a redundancy she needs to work beyond. Those of you watching this film for a horrorthemed thriller are going to be mostly put off. This film really does not rely to such an extent the horror mechanisms rather it builds the tension through a number of strictly dialogue scenes using the plot to intrigue rather than scare tactics.The ending  quite literally the last twenty minutes is the only place you're likely to see what may be called horror. I will not give away what happens here you have to watch it and see. All I will say is that the ending left me anticipating more. That said my overall opinion is this movie is satisfactory at best not a true stand out in the annals of cinema history but certainly not one of the poorest examples of the profession.".

Soon Spencer's wife Jillian falls pregnant with twins and they move to New York for Spencer to take up a job with a military aerospace firm.  However Jillian begins to have doubts that Spencer hasn't been changed by his experience  doubts that are backed up by NASA scientist Sherman Reese.Playing like a cross between Rosemary's Baby and Contact this film attracted me to it on the strength that Johnny Depp was in the lead.  The plot is interesting as I quite enjoy scifi when it is done well although it maybe doesn't deliver everything you'd expect in terms of thrills.  It has a nice slow patient build up throughout the film we are invited to be unsure if Jillian is losing it or if she's catching on to the reality of her situation.  A great performance by Joe Morton helps this uncertainty as he plays a NASA rep who may be unhinged as much as he is informed.The director uses various tricks to help keep the film feeling tight.  Shots flash quickly around the illustrate the panic and confusion in Jillian's head the camera spins around some key confrontations to make the movement draw out pace etc but for the most part he has a lowkey tension playing constantly which for me worked better than big shocks and scares.  The truth' is revealed a little too early leaving the film with it's wad blown with still 20 minutes to go and the climatic confrontation would have worked better with a rant that explains everything in terms of why' and who'  but the actual conclusion is pretty cool and maybe it's better we're left wondering.Depp is OK in the lead but not his best work.  He only has to walk round looking menacing and talking with the Texan accent and that's it!  Theron is much better and she portrays Jillian so well that the audience aren't sure if she's crazy or not.  Her gradual descent is well done and helped by the director.  Morton is excellent in what amounts to little more than a cameo and the rest of the cast are pretty good.Overall this is not a perfect film and is really a bit of a hybrid of genres but it works pretty well.  The slow build up of tension works well even if it bails out before it should.  The ending may be slightly unsatisfying but there's no denying it is a brave attempt.  I enjoyed it even if I felt like a bigger ending was in order.".

This element of the story could have kept us in doubt through the whole film Is her husband now an alien or is it all her delusional mind at work? Yet the ominous soundtrack never leaves us in doubt this is not a case of possible mental breakdown  it is an alien movie. Nor does Johnny Depp's emotionless and increasingly ominous delivery of lines emphasized to be sure by the music leave any doubt after a short time. Pity that the director didn't employ more ambiguous less atmospheric music and more light this is a very dark film and direct Depp in a more ambiguous less ominous delivery of his lines of which Depp one of my favorite actors of all time is more than capable. A less heavyhanded approach by the director would have kept us wondering whether to believe Jillian's suspicions or to be suspicious of her ourselves.

Unlike Wood's movies this isn't even enjoyable on a so bad it's good basis. The Astronaut's Wife is just so bad it's bad.Johnny Depp in the biggest mistake of his life plays the too too perfect astronaut husband of Charlize Theron. Depp never utters one line of sincere dialogue in the entire movie. Instead he wanders around like a zombie stopping every once in a while to say something oh so romantic to his wife.Theron fares even worse. One moment she is playing the whimpering wife the next she is barking out orders. Then take me to someone who can! is one of the worst lines of dialogue I have ever heard. It would be nice to blame all of Theron's ineptness in this movie to bad writing and directing but I fear there is another reason. Behind that incredible beauty is a woman who simply doesn't know how to act.I could go on blasting this movie but why bother? Just remember this fair warning Next time you're in the video store and you see this movie on the shelf don't be fooled. You may really like science fiction you may love Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron but leave this turkey on the shelf. Let it slowly decompose and go back to wherever it came from.".

	schema:reviewBody "Astronaut's wife is nowhere near as bad as its reputation suggests. In fact I honestly found it to be engrossing while being deliberately slowpaced. It really does echo Rosemary's baby throughout. It's almost as if the filmmakers were heavily influenced by it and wanted to make a tribute to it of sorts. The eerie atmosphere definitely helps things as there was more than one occasion I felt creeped out. Astronaut's Wife relies on messing with your mind and making you think. It really is a movie that requires at least a couple of viewings in my opinion to fully appreciate it. Some people accused of Johnny Depp of being too lowkey here I respectfully disagree. I thought he handled the part beautifully and was very creepy. I think many people hate this movie is because of the deliberate slow pace and that it tried to be something different. Rosemary's Baby was hailed as a classic but not without a fair amount of controversy in between. Astronaut's Wife's criticism was much harsher but in the same mold.Performances. Johnny Depp is perfectly lowkey here. He garnered a lot of criticism for his portrayal but he was great in my opinion. He gave me the willies on more than one occasion. Charlize Theron is excellent in her role. She carried the film very well and had a perfect chemistry with Depp. We aren't sure if she's crazy or not and that was a tough feat to pull off. Joe Morton is suitably creepy and mysterious in his role. Clea DuVall is rather wooden and unlikable in her role.Bottom line. It is far from perfect but I still quite enjoyed it. Accept its deliberate pace and put your brain on thinking mode. I dislike the hatred this film gets.Recommended710".

For instance in this film many complain that he didn't change like he was supposed to and that it took no effort on his part except lurking about and using an accent. It would seem to me that these people weren't paying attention. First we don't have a lot to go on as for the attitude of before Spencer. So maybe those people didn't remember the first few minutes of the film when we see the couple being playful in bed watch as he thoughtfully calls his wife from space and listen to Jillian's sister comment on what a seemingly perfect guy he is. When he comes back he is quite different. He is icy not adorable even if he pulls it off in a sexy way. Even when he is playful he seems to have to gather his script for it such as when he is creepily behind the refrigerator and then suddenly becomes his old self. His eyes are extremely different as they get harsher throughout the movie. Some also complain that the violent sex need not be shown but I think it's kind of important. First it again shows contrast between before and after. Second after his dirty and extremely sexy I thought especially since it's Depp musings to Jillian about her importance it gives a clue to his real motives as once things progress he seems to forget about her thoughts on the matter at all.I thought Charlize Theron was great. She skillfully pulled off this wife's horrible downspiral as she realizes the truth about her life. I thought it was a brilliant portrayal.I love the odd camera angles that show what they need to. Especially during the violent sex. Helped me bear it. Also the subway scene it was a great display of what her mental state was.I'm still somewhat confused over the importance of the planes and the twins and such but I bet if I watched it a few more times I'd understand better.I really liked the end. Throughout the whole thing I was like she'll kill herself and then what does she do? I thought was brilliant until the alien jumped bodies. I just don't understand how that works although I suppose it could have to do with the electricity and the water.So yeah I think it was great. Its full potential was not met obviously. I think with a few slight differences it could have been a classic.".

Despite being vulgar crude brazen and not particularly handsome Daryl manages to be able to tap into the innermost emotions of the three friends and as such manages to seduce each. In turn the three women blossom emotionally and sexually. After an incident involving one of the town's leading citizens the ultra conservative Felicia Alden the three women begin to understand how and why Daryl is able to mesmerize them so fully.

It can be described as a supernatural Battle of the Sexes  with horrific comedic and dramatic elements with a bizarre love  story orgy at the center of it. The 3 witches Cher Susan Sarandon  and Michelle Pfeiffer make a request for the perfect man who is  delivered to them in the form of Daryl Van Horne Jack Nicholson aka  the Devil.   According to Daryl when a man is encountered by a strong woman his  manhood goes limp. The woman is called a witch and set on fire. This  is used to make women scared of men and scared of themselves. Daryl's  attention allows the 3 women to embrace their sexuality fertility  passion and ambition. Eventually they realize they no longer need men  for anything including Daryl. This culminates in the ultimate showdown  with man vs. women.  The SFX quality was good enough to win the BAFTA Award in 1987. The  music by John Williams earned him an Oscar and Grammy nomination.  Nicholson gives an incredibly over the top performance that was good  enough to win both the NY  LA Critics Choice Awards.  There is a lot of back story to this as well. Bill Murray was  originally set to play Darryl and Cher and Sarandon switched roles once  they walked onto the set. The studio execs hassled the director so much  that Miller halted production. When they threatened to replace him with  another director Nicholson said he would walk away from the  production. This ended the feuding.  Favorite Quote Almost all the dialogue. Cher asks Nicholson's  character if he is married. To which he responds  I don't believe in  it. Good for the man bad for the woman. She dies she suffocates. Then  the Husband complains that he is fcking a dead woman and he is the one  that killed her. Where is your Husband? Cher replies Dead.  DVD Extras Full Cast  Crew Bios a set design feature entitled   Conjuring Eastwick a Bewitching Look Back at the history Awards  Commentary Interviews and a Trailer which indicates there are  deleted scenes missing from the DVD. There should also be the numerous  alternate endings they had shot.  Bottom Line Bewitching tale pun intended with something for  everyone.  Rating 8.510".

There are other actors who have portrayed the man downstairs Al Pacino in Devil's Advocate was the devil as lawyer Billy Crystal was himself in the WoodyDante sequence in Deconstructing Harry even Elizabeth Hurley in Bedazzled. But rarely have they had this much outright fun and charm with the role enough to almost make me a man in his 20s charmed too. Maybe it's the eyebrows. Nicholson gives one of his best overthetop performances as the hornylittle devil Darryl who comes into town during a storm and cooks up more than that for his avid female guests. Of course he doesn't have control for long when the girls find they have powers of their own. When the movie gets overly fantastic which is a number of times it gets a little hard to take yet the acting is above par and the special effects are a delight.".

	schema:headline " Welltold tale of an ageold struggle";
	schema:reviewBody "From the director who brought us Mad Max comes a modernday fairy tale of sorts that examines the ageold battle of the sexes. Alex Cher Jane Susan Sarandon and Sukie Michelle Pfeiffer are three single women who live in the sleepy New England town of Eastwick. Since all of them lack a man in their lives and are dissatisfied with the ones who are in town they wish for a handsome stranger to visit. Miraculously their wish is granted when Daryl Van Horne Jack Nicholson strolls into town and succeeds in turning their lives and the town's upside down. For the most part I thought that the story was very effective in setting up its characters and giving them depth even Daryl. The three women who are the titular Witches of Eastwick were all distinct personalities and had situations that made you care about them. Generally speaking the performances were all very good although Jack Nicholson towers above the rest of the cast as he brings his brand of insanity to what is essentially the devil in human form. Even the whole witch thing was dealt with rather subtly as the women only become witches by finding the power within themselves. It is this struggle between male and female power which forms the core conflict of the film and it is a compelling one even though it has been many times over in various forms. The townspeople are also given some development although probably not enough to warrant the attention provided them. There are references made to the Salem witch trials and the wife of the town's newspaper editor Richard Jenkins...with hair! acts as the mouthpiece for morality when the the three witches start their relationship with Daryl. Despite this interesting aside I think it detracts a little bit from the main conflict. Moving on I also thought that John Williams' score was fantastic and had this magicalmysterious quality that really meshed with the story and visuals. It's not his best score but it was still a very good one. There were also a number of special effects by ILM which I thought were also welldone especially considering this was made in 1987. Overall I thought this was a very entertaining and funny movie that presented a wellworn theme in a fresh way. The only detraction I think is that there's a bit of a mean streak in regards to the portrayal of the male characters which might turn that half of the audience off. Still this is a quality film that shows off director George Miller's versatility and the acting talents of its cast.".

	schema:headline " WITCHES OF EASTWICK  Symbolic Sexuality Subtle Themes  Great Performances";
	schema:reviewBody "THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK George Miller's 1987 adaptation of John Updike's hit novel has always been a movie I admired and wanted to love more then I ever actually did. But something about the film was so bizarrely intriguing that I have always returned for repeat viewing sporadically throughout the years. Upon reflection I think I always expected it to be a different movie then it is... bc I finally feel that I understood what the film aimed to be.In the past I always watched the movie expecting a spectacle of witchcraft and fantasy... but in reality that's not what one should expect from this movie. The Witches Of Eastwick is a sexual suspense film with an underlying supernatural mystery.It tells the story of three bored women Cher Susan Sarandon  Michelle Pfeiffer who don't seem to realize the powers they possess. They live in the town of Eastwick where not much happens for these women especially when it comes to eligible bachelors. One night they decide to wish for the arrival of a worthy man who can offer all the things they most desire. To their surprise the next day a wealthy bachelor moves into the town's landmark mansion and he is ready to woo the three witches of Eastwick.Alex Cher Sukie Pfeiffer and Jane Sarandon all eventually fall under the spell of their magical suitor Daryll Van Horn played by Jack Nicholson. He appears like magic and offers them all the fantasies and pleasures they had hoped for. However for another resident of Eastwic Daryll represents evil. Felicia Alden played wonderfully by Veronica Cartwright suffers from hysterics as she is the only person to sense Daryll's evil plan.Little by little the women realize that Daryll is not exactly a magical blessing. Instead he is a demondevil who took advantage of the dark magic they accidentally used to summon him. Turns out Daryll or the devil's plan was to unite with these three witches to create his offspring. But once the witches find out they've accidentally opened the door for a demon to enter Eastwick is there still time to stop him? What sounds like an outlandish plot of fantasy and horror is actually handled with a great deal of subtlety up until the film's climax. The majority of the film uses cunning sexual symbolism to allude to Daryll's innerdevil. He playfully seduces the women by saying exactly what they want to hear... but little do the women know it's bc he's a powerful demon who can manipulate their needs and desires like a true Casanova. Symbolic links between sexual desire and seductive bliss are apparent through the emphasis on such things as snakes and forbidden fruit.One thing that is so interested about The Witches Of Eastwick is that it never bends to the audience. The undertones of the film are subtle and nothing is ever spelled out for us. Our only clues to Daryll's true identity are in Felicia's incoherent rants. However slowly but surely George Miller offers revelations that link Felicia's theory and Daryll's actions so that the audience realizes the truth about the situation.The performances in this film from the 5 leading players help to elevate both the depth and the cool factor for the film. Jack Nicholson doesn't bring much nuance or subtlety to the role of Daryll... however he is barrels of evil fun here. Without reserve Nicholson captures the total evil of Daryll mixed with his primal need to hold onto the women he lusts after. And those women are all portrayed with equal confidence and talent. Cher as the leader of the pack Alex brings a tough as nails attitude to the role while layering her with a woman who still yearns for the protection of a man. Pfeiffer as the freespirited Sukie brings an innocent awareness to the only character who seems to believe in the powers the girls possess. And meanwhile Sarandon is tons of fun as plain Jane turned sex addict... her's is the most fun performance of the Witches.And to top it off the film features a dynamite supporting performance from Veronica Cartwright. It's a role that could have gone highcamp very easily but Cartwright grounds it with so much conviction that it works beautifully. Prepare for the scene in her house with her husband think of Cherry Pits... it's a good one.Watching The Witches Of Eastwick in the past my favorite part was always the finale. In it's final 15 minutes the movie turns into a special effects action sequence. These final moments are most exciting because it is the only section of the film in which the Witches use their powers knowingly. Whereas in the past I had hoped more of the movie would be about the magicfantasy elements... upon this viewing I came to appreciate the slow burn the movie uses to build up to it's grand climax.While the film is not perfect... it is an interesting time at the movies. It offers a handful of fun performances from actor's who clearly had a ball making this film. It also keeps the audience guessing for almost the entire film by keeping many elements under the surface. Sure the film maybe could have been a little shorter and having not read the book I'm not sure whether it lives up to the source material. But for me The Witches Of Eastwick is a really great film that only improves with repeat viewings.... B ...".

He grants all their desires and wishes not to mention makes them feel more alive then they ever have before. There of course is always a catch Jack is a warlock a very powerful one at that not to mention an evil one. But after he is rejected by the girls he decides to get back at them not in the most pleasant way. The girls decide to trick him and use his own magics against him.Sometimes a comedy sometimes horror but over all I'd say that this movie is worth a watch. I mean the stars alone are worth it we have Oscar winners and nominee's.

	schema:headline " Not really the camp 80's film it's marketed as...";
	schema:reviewBody "In the small American town of Eastwick where Christian values of morality and family life serve as the law strange and violent events begin to occur with the arrival of a new big city millionaire charmer by the name of Darrell Van Horn Nicholson. His entrance is seemingly brought on by the wish of three single women who are supposedly Witches played by Cher Pfeiffer and Sarandon who can make anything happen by wishing it at the same time. Soon we see Van Horn seducing and having a polygamous relationship with the three witches which leads to happiness laughter and disaster. Who exactly is this Van Horn character and is this the beginning of a new era in family values? Like its other 80's contemporaries such as Working Girl and Fatal Attraction The Witches of Eastwick doubles as a social commentary on the state of women in a male dominated society as well as a simple point A to point B story. Here the focus is on the new breed of middle aged single women who can be mothers and career women and still have time for a cocktail at the end of the day without the need for a providing husband.While the film does work as a thought inducing critique on the perception of modern women and the men who have always tried to exploit them as a whole it lacks focus. At various points it tries to be a thriller a satire and a serious look at modern America but director George Miller never really manages to blend these different tones into one cohesive whole. As a result the film seems a little confused. On the plus side though the whole cast give fantastic performances especially Nicholson and Sarandon who clearly seem to be having more fun playing their mischievous roles than others and the film does have quite a few dark laugh out loud moments.For those of you looking for a fun camp eighties movie it might be a better idea for you to revisit Working Girl or Overboard since you will clearly be disappointed by this picture. Fans of Nicholson and Gurrrl Powerin it's most radical sense should definitely check this one out.".

This film starts reasonably true to the book but soon descends into a terrible mess. The sexual element is downplayed whereas the mystical element is taken increasingly literally. The move ends with an extended excruciating sequence of supposedly comic horror this is neither comic nor horrific but moreover stripped of the writer's subtlety at least one scene becomes directly misogynistic.

Originally I haven't never heard of it. But when I read the informations about the movie I was completely thrilled by it and my hype went sky high. I mean how can a movie directed by George Miller the 'Mad Max' series with a score composed by John Williams the 'Star Wars' series the 'Indiana Jones series' the 'Superman' series 'E.T. The Extra Terrestrial' and many others and featuring four of my favorite actors of all time Jack Nicholson Cher Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer could be bad? Well apparently this movie succeed into wasting all this potential in a boring and nonsense flick...'The Witches of Eastwick' story is based on a novel by John Updike that tells the story of three single women that live a very small New England town called Eastwick. They are Alexandra Medford Cher Jane Spofford Susan Sarandon and Sukie Ridgemont Michelle Pfeiffer. The shallowness of their lives is soon to be changed when a new man moves into town. Daryl Van Horne Jack NIcholson is exactly what the three of them were waiting. He is filthy rich and wild eyed and they innocently conjure up to him. But while with him they discover almighty powers in them selves finding out that they actually witches and Van Horne is the devil. The plot seems to be kinda nonsense and it is indeed. And aside from not making sense at all the movie's screenplay is also badly adapted from Updike's book by Michael Cristofer. This makes the movie worse than it is because of the horrible development of the story and the completely garbage dialogs. There also some scenes that are unnecessarily disgusting and badwritten. But the script is not all bad. There are a few funny lines though and the movie has a surprisingly wellmade and fun ending. With a cast like this you can't help but wait a topnotch overall acting. And that's why I've got completely disappointed by the acting here. It seems like the ensemble just didn't work and that's a shame. The alwaysexcellent Jack Nicholson delivered a great performance as usual with some nice voice and body work. His final speech is something truly amazing. But the rest of the cast simply didn't know what to do. All the supporting cast was bad specially Veronica Cartwright and Richard Jenkis as two of the city's habitants. And when you though that Cher Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer were going to equal Nicholson's work they didn't. All the three female stars were bad specially Cher and Michelle Pfeiffer. Nothing compared to what they did in movies like 'Moonstruck' or 'Scarface'. On the other hand Susan Sarandon at least tried to deliver a comic performance but just couldn't. All she did was embarrass herself and this statement works not just for Sarandon but for Cher and Pfeiffer also.There's nothing to comment on George Miller's directing work in this picture. It's just another point to be disappointed by  he did nothing special. The special effects were great for 1987 but it's sort of thing that didn't age well. Kids these days would laugh at some scenes. Aside from Nicholson's performance two other things saved the movie in my opinion. They were the setdecoration which I really liked and John Williams's original music score. There are some truly great pieces written for the movie and some of the tunes don't get out of my head.Overall 'The Witches of Eastwick' is the movie that wasted most potential in cinema's history. A could've been great flick was transformed into a disappoint because of the horrible acting writing and directing. If it wasn't for Jack Nicholson's good performance and John Williams' catchy tunes 'The Witches of Eastwick' would've been a fail in every sense of the word. 410".

This film shows these women in their normal lives and then when they get together the powers unfold. So fun to watch things happening to Jack Nicholson....his acting is brilliant as usual. When you want to be entertained just rent this film and remember why each of them is a star. Why do we love the all star casts? Maybe because the reason for their stardom is their personality and when great personalities gettogether on film.....we all love the chemistry.".

It should teach all men not to cross a woman cause you just may not know when you're dealing with a witch. When powerful women get together things happen and men beware. This film shows these women in their normal lives and then when they get together the powers unfold. So fun to watch things happening to Jack Nicholson....his acting is brilliant as usual. When you want to be entertained just rent this film and remember why each of them is a star. Why do we love the all star casts? Maybe because the reason for their stardom is their personality and when great personalities gettogether on film.....we all love the chemistry.";

In fact at times you can even see a whole string of punches and blocks without a cut or a shake!  Of course there is the inevitable wire work that combined with the necessary special effects to allow Jet Li to fight himself.  But for once there is an excuse other than because we can.The story is pretty simple.  A murdering criminal is killing all the copies of himself in all the other universes.  Each time one dies the life forceresonant string thing gets divided amoungst the survivors.  Of course this leaves a ton of questions that aren't addressed at all in the movie but I can live with that since those are more topics for debate after having fun at the movie.  That is one of the strengths of the movie the progressively more intense action.  As the movie progress rather than trying to deal with any question the viewer might have the pace and intensity of the movie goes up.  The final action sequence is probably ten minutes long all told which to me is a sign of a true action movie as opposed to movies with action.Overall I give it a 810 for fans of the genre.  If you aren't particularly interested in scifimartial arts especially if you have a problem with wire work and bluescreens then you might want to skip it.".

Action movies don't aim for that stuff so it's a little unfair to then expect it.Mostly stuff blows up in The One and I'm totally OK with that being an action movie buff. What's weird is that you know they're using lots of wires and some of the stunts are a little overdone. But forget the fictional character's skill  just the skill you'd need as a stuntman or stuntwoman making this movie to perform some of these stunts is truly impressive!Let me warn you that the plot is a pretty stupid and while billed as a science fiction film it really is not. However it's nowhere near as bad as subintelligent flicks Independence Day and Mission Impossible. It was more like Mission Impossible 2. And lots and lots of stuff blows up.Compared to Jackie Chan Jet Li's films have more action but it's stuntlike rather than natural more of an edge including blood and gore less comedy and he speak better English. I still prefer Jackie. If you're new to martial arts films ease yourself in with accessible Jackie Chan actioncomedies Shanghai Noon or Twin Dragons.Who should see this film action movie buffs and borderline action movie typeswho will trade overviolence for underplotting.And don't drag along your SO. scifi movie buffs who don't form expectations of real scifiand like action flicks I can't think of anyone else.

Jet Li's English is such an improvement on his past efforts and you can feel the affection in his voice when he talks to about his wife. Jackie Chan as wonderful as he is still hasn't mastered English to Jet Li's level.The action was great. I'm not looking for realism in a scifi movie. I had no expectations. Just watched to see what I'd get  and for the 1.5 hours I was entertained. It's a simple story simple concept.I wish people would go to see this movie and not try to compare it to Matrix. Matrix itself is not innocent of borrowing special effects already used in other movies. As for the there can be only one theme look back to the old days of Astroboy. There was that robot war thing where they had to kill each other so there would be only one winner. Big deal.I will definitely be buying the DVD.

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't want to write this movie off on the reviews and critics in the western world I mean how wrong have they been about Asian cinema that has now become a staple diet of the Hollywood remake monster? Plus Jet L is pretty damn cool and he's made some interesting movies in Asia. So with an open mind I was surprisingly averaged out by this movie.There are good points. The story is very clever using MTheory as a base to bring forward the plot that there are multiple universes each with their own versions of worlds and most likely you. Each time one of you is destroyed the rest share the energy and power amongst them. The idea that someone might try and purposely become the only version of themselves in all the Universes to find out if they become a God.There's also Jet Li and he's not a bad actor and pretty nimble as a martial artist plus Jason Statham who is an all round good actor. As for the special effects some of them are really cool a mixing of bullet time and slow motion with normal speed very cool to watch in places.The bad points? Well Statham's accent is appalling and some of the effects aren't as comparable as others so it's quite apparent that money was spent on some of the main shots and not on others that were probably deemed as too short on screen or they just plain ran out of budget.A big sore point for me is the close cropped camera action that Hollywood has long favoured something that Jackie Chan has often talked about. Filming fight scenes close up serves two purpose. It gives greater emphasis on a single punch or movement making it look harder and more real than it really is and it also hides what is going on around the camera lens. For example people holding a fake arm or the face of a stunt double etc.What Chan always said was that he tried to open out the camera and show the audience what was going on let them see the people fighting properly rather than a close up of a face and a fist cutting to someone falling into frame. Showing the whole picture is more effective and it's more impressive.So the close cropped shots were just more annoying than anything you failed to see the impressiveness of Li's fighting skills and you found it hard to see some of the action. Slow the cuts down and pan out the camera Hollywood Directors! The biggest problem was the story though despite having such a strong base on which to build they seemed to loose the sense of the plot and concentrate on the action scenes. There are some serious plot building and explanatory moments that are just totally overlooked and covered in the space of a few sentences yet these could have formed some excellent and complex character development.It just all held together too weakly and not enough was made of the story. All in all not a great movie and it's potential was badly spoiled.".

In that world even popular actors move props and the simplest gopher criticizes the players until they get it right. In that world films are an outgrowth of a stylized stage tradition that emphasizes physical acting. In this tradition Li is probably the chief dancer perhaps the best there is. In this world they use him for his physical grace and his way of expressing himself with his body.But he has an evil twin in a parallel universe called Hollywood. In this universe films are something wholly different a much gaudier spectacle in which fireworks and noise are the attraction. Actors are primarily marketing elements and are expected to act through dialog. In fact most actors in this world never learn to use their bodies at all. There is some physical motion but that is arranged by digital magic and stunt standins.This film is a battle between the honest and evil Lis for the one body. What's interesting is watching the good Li try to bring something from the other world. He does try some esoteric subtle shading in the fighting styles stances and motions of the two versions of himself. The good Li uses motions from the Hong Kong era that are genuine. The evil Li uses a parody of moves that aren't real at all but copies of what western kids think martial arts looks like. What he does is a big joke and something to admire and respect for him to poke fun at his western audience at least for those of us who pay attention.In Hollywood films there has to be all this foolery with guns. See Once Upon a Time in China' to get a feel for the background battle between shootingblowingup movies and martial arts films.

Th fights were sweetalthough looked slightly cheesy. it looked like they tried to achieve the matrix type effects but didn't have a good enough budget. The Acting was OK. They stuck some good actors in with some bad ones so that kinda screws up the whole feel for the movie. The storyline is quite simple and somewhat intriguing. There are many universes you look quite similar in everyone and your all connected by a wave of energy. every time one of you dies the energy of that you that died goes to the remaining yous. One man has killed all of himself but one. Th movie basically starts here. Yulaw is about to get banished forever but stops his universe travel and goes to the last universe left ours. Lately Gabe law has been getting stronger but he doesn't know why.Whenever they go from one universe to the next they break up into little puzzle pieces and they didn't do a very good job for the visuals on those.My rating a 35 Stars".

Li plays the dual role of Yulaw a former policeman of the Multiverse' who at some point happened onto the fact that if his own counterpart in one universe dies his strength is increased and Gabriel a member of the L.A.P.D. who knows nothing of the existence of Yulaw or the parallel universes until he finds himself suddenly and inexplicably being hunted down by an unknown predator.  Gabriel it seems is the last of Yulaw's counterparts and he has thus far disposed of one hundred twentythree others already.  And if the theory of the Multiverse proves to be true with Gabriel's demise Yulaw will become a kind of god invincible and unstoppable.  But there is another theory that states that if such a thing in fact occurs it will mean the destruction of the universe in which it transpires.  So there is a lot on the line with only two policemen from the Multiverse Roedecker Delroy Lindo and Funsch Jason Statham on Yulaw's trail hoping to stop him before it's too late.Wong has crafted a clever and fastpaced actionpacked adventure in which his star Li proves more than capable of maintaining the excitement especially in the scenes in which he squares off with himself with a nod of thanks to the FX wizardsatlarge.  In this case more is better and two' Li's equals twice the action which is the name of the game in this movie.  But though the action is plentiful and extremely well done and choreographed the story even with it's interesting premise never seems to be fully realized or at least not up to it's potential.  And the action is good but it lacks the nuance and finesse of films like John Woo's The Killer' or Hard Boiled' and also the poetry that worked so well and enhanced the story of Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.'  Still with this film Wong moves very close to finding himself in the company of those great directors.  Jet Li has made a number of films and certainly demonstrates here that he has that star' quality but though he has the looks and the moves he does not possess the charismatic screen presence of a Jackie Chan or a Bruce Lee and as an actor he has some definite room for improvement.  He does put on a good show however and when the fight is on he is riveting to watch and after all that was the intent of making this film in the first place.  And in that respect it certainly succeeds.  On the acting front Carla Gugino gives a solid performance as T.K. Gabriel's wife and though her supporting role is little more than a diversion between the action sequences she is a welcome presence to the proceedings and makes the most of the screen time she is allotted.  Most importantly she makes T.K. believable which adds some needed strength and emotional involvement to the story.Lindo does a good job as well but his character Roedecker lacks the development that would've made him a more integral part of the story.  The same can be said of Statham also and Funsch seems to be little more than a means by which to move the story along.  Not a bad device but it adds so much more to a film when the characters involved have some real life of their own in them.The supporting cast includes Brandon Molale Stygian Prisoner Scott L. Schwartz Prisoner and Kim McKamy Doctor.  A film that seems to fly by as fast as Jet Li's feet and fists The One' is definitely an exciting experience and makes for some satisfying entertainment.  It's a whatyouseeiswhatyouget kind of a movie and the chances are pretty good that you're going to get exactly what you expected going in.  For fans of Jet Li and the martial arts it's going to be an especially thrilling ride and for everyone else it's going to at least get the adrenaline flowing and the heart pumping a little faster for an hourandahalf or so guaranteed.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 610.".

Unfortunately either the budget was not ample enough to accommodate better lighting effects film quality and some acting lessons or the director just did not care enough to bother with these little details.

This outing sees the titular character nursing a farmhouse family whose father is off at war. The mother played by Maggie Gyllenhaal is obliged the sell the land to her nasty brother Rhys Ifans a slimy character who will not rest till he gets his way. Meanwhile the children's' vile London cousins come to stay  two little brats who bawk at the state of the earthy farm abode.Enter Nanny McPhee  an otherworldly being who appears when a family needs her most  squashednosed and snaggletoothed she calmly teaches the children five important lessons though when things get out of hand she must employ the same supernatural technique of setting down her walking stick as she did in her previous adventure and to spectacular effect. Nanny McPhee attempts to set the household to rights using these very methods while the family struggle on with their visitors and hope against hope that their father will return.Thanks to Emma Thompson's involvement the film boasts a impressive array of British thespians including Maggie Smith Ewan McGregor and Ralph Fiennes as a senior WW2 army officer. Though characterisation is hardly profound in a story such as this each actor has their moment to shine  and Gyllenhaal as the young mother sports a flawless British accent and conveys her trademark maternal emotion when needs be. Production values are stellar with all the period details on display. The film whisks along at a nice pace and never gets bogged down in one place  Thompson's adaptation is wrought with real warmth and wit and once again she works wonders onscreen under layers of prosthetics with every wry glance and raise of the eyebrow worthy of a laugh.Setting the story of against the backdrop of World War II is very smart move  the 'big bang' in the title referring to the imminent threat of bombings during this time period. This gives the film a foundation of realism that the previous movie lacked....however there's little room left for war time misery in the thematic threads of this story  you're more like to find a group of piglets doing synchronised swimming than any sign of a swastika.Ultimately this is a family film written for children  talking to them not at them and carrying a very sensitive message at its heart. There are no doubleentendres for the adults the snigger at this is harmless entertainment at its best. It may not be a new classic but it's nice to see something like this making its way to our screens during the Easter break.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know what the critics here were expecting but from some of the reviews I've read it seems that it wasn't a kids' film. In short this is a lovely wellwritten beautifully cast film that's executed with great affection and makes maximum use of its chocolatebox locations.Emma Thompson aside from having no little talent for scriptwriting is savvy enough to understand that the real stars of this film are the children and in particular Asa Butterfield and Eros Vlahos as Norman and Cyril respectively.Rhys Ifans shows what an accomplished comic actor he is even if his performance as Uncle Phil seems to draw much both in characterisation and delivery from that of Matt Dillon's portrayal of Healy in There's Something About Mary.There's a lovely turn from Maggie Smith as Mrs Docherty and a reassuringly exuberant performance from Sam Kelly.If there's a lull it's when the action moves away from its countryside setting although the scene played between Vlahos and Ralph Feinnes works nicely.At a little under an hour and fifty minutes it's quite long for children yet my five and eightyearolds sat transfixed throughout. And in the end that should be the yardstick by which any film aimed at younger cinemagoers should be measured.As to Thompson herself she is sublime when required understated when the surrounding action demands. The reviewer who likened her performance to that of Roger Moore does not I would suggest appreciate either the characterisation of the Nanny McPhee role much can be and is portrayed by simple facial expressions or the very real acting ability of our erstwhile Bond. Comedy isn't all about snappy oneliners and the ability to convey comedy simply by saying nothing is an art in and of itself.In the final analysis this is a better film than its predecessor. It is more lovinglycrafted less fantastic in the literal sense and more sharply observed. Watch it for what it is  a modern take on the old Mary Poppins story  and you won't be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you've seen the first Nanny McPhee movie then you know the premise of the second A harried single parent this time a woman played by Maggie Gyllenhaal is overwhelmed by her three children plus two cousins from London who come to stay at her small farm. World War II is raging her husband is somewhere in the battle theater and her brotherinlaw Rhys Ifans wants nothing more than to sell the family farm out from under her.Just as poor Isabel Green wonders how she'll manage to make a payment on the tractor get the crops in keep her senile boss Maggie Smith from destroying the store fend off Phil Green's efforts to get her to sign away her rights to the farm and still take care of five children Nanny McPhee Emma Thompson arrives on the scene.Nanny McPhee of course takes the children promptly in hand and wastes no time teaching them the lessons they need to learn. If Isabel and Phil learn something along the way so much the better.The script is fairly silly penned by Emma Thompson it's aimed at a very young audience though it does have its occasional moments of cleverness and poignancy and one especially silly moment that I must confess was hysterical no matter your age. There's also a heartrending tiein to the first film.The acting is quite good though melodramatic which in fairness is entirely appropriate here. As an aside Maggie Gyllenhaal's English accent is pretty convincing! The children are just fine but I must single out Eros Vlahos who plays cousin Cyril and Lil Woods in the role of Megsie Green. Maggie Smith is of course her usual stellar self and Emma Thompson manages to play a caricature of a character without overdoing it at all. A small part for Ralph Fiennes and a cameo from Ewan MacGregor cap off a very capable cast.BOTTOM LINE Nanny McPhee Returns was cute but it wasn't all that good from my own perspective. I'll tell you though that every last four five and six yearold in the theatre giggled gasped laughed and cooed right when they were supposed to. While I can't recommend this movie for your own grownup or even teenagers' night out your younger kids will just love it.POLITICAL NOTES Although Nanny McPhee Returns takes place during World War II and mentions of the war feature prominently no details of the reasons for the fight or any political judgments whatsoever are made. Given the nature of that particular conflict I'd say that there was some real skill exercised in writing about it! FAMILY SUITABILITY Nanny McPhee Returns is rated PG for rude humor some language and mild thematic elements. Frankly children young enough to enjoy this movie take especial delight in rude humor like that exhibited here and the mild thematic elements will likely be largely above their heads. Any real concerns should be easily addressed by Mom or Dad after the movie's over.".

Yes even Isabel's muddy farm looks like an enjoyable place to live at. The creativity in writing and art direction amuses me for example watching those piglets lying in the scratch machine was cute and hilarious. The new animal characters especially the baby elephant are a delight. The lighting and slightly yellowish tint gives 'Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang' a very sunny look. The humour works very well as it had me laughing out loud on various occasions.However unlike in the first movie the story here felt rushed and there were some inconsistencies. The bomb sequence as entertaining as it was wasn't necessary and it only distracted from the main story. The child actors here are competent but their counterparts in the first film performed better. While the special effects here are very good they didn't appear as authentic.Emma Thompson reprises the title role and she does a fine job. She mostly takes the backseat while letting the other actors perform. Maggie Gyllenhaal shows a knack for comedy and her English accent sounds authentic. Maggie Smith is a riot. Rhys Ifans does well as the greedy uncle.'Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang' may not measure up to 'Nanny McPhee' but it's still a lot of fun and a good watch for the family.

And she's accompanied in the film by many compelling actors like Rhys Ifans Maggie Smith Ralph Fiennes and Maggie Gyllenhaal who sounds fine sporting an English accent. There's also an appearance by Ewan McGregor in a role I don't want to reveal. Also fine were the children playing Ms. Gyllenhaal's offspring and the cousins who convincingly transition from spoiled rotten to more socially appealing during the picture.

A remarkable scene is when Nanny McPhee and the 2 boys go to the head war office in Londen. When they arrive in Londen you can see an old factory with four chimney's in the background. As common in war time city's you could see anti aircraft balloons in the sky and one was shaped like a pig. This scene resembles a famous cover of a Pink Floyd album called 'Animals'. One of the tracks on this album is 'Pigs on the wing'.The producer must be a big Pink Floyd fan.".

Baring in mind that I was hardly the imagined demographic for the first outing I'm 24 years old and not by nature a sentimental person I could not believe that a sequel could ever recapture the magic and sheer exuberance of the first. But it did and then some! After the first ten minutes of the film I was so engaged in Emma's story telling and the characters that any fear vanished. Featuring some truly funny moments delivered by some very good young actors and once again brilliantly performed by Emma Thompson the second Nanny McPhee film is for me as much in league with modern children's classics as the much hyped Harry Potter. I found the storyline joyful and uplifting without being saccharine sweet and the film boasts some wonderful cameos. Katy Brand steals the show as the rough voiced yet somehow glamorous hit woman hot on the heels of Rhys Ifan's delightfully over the top villain. If I had to make any fault at all with this film it is at Maggie Gyllenhaal's unexpected casting and sometimes overly enthusiastic gushing although generally Gyllenhaal is a decent actress she remains quite unlikeable for the first half of this film as the overworked yet underwhelming mother character. A stunning turn from Dame Maggie Smith as she proves she still has the power to take even the smallest of roles and turn it into a wonderfully amusing well performed piece.".

The lessons were taught after one incident of naughty behavior. No one not even movie kids learn a life lesson in one episode! Part of the charm in the first movie was that you were left to wonder if the lessons were learned due to the children learning and living them or from the magic of Nanny McFee. In the second movie there is no question that magic has changed behavior not a realization of why this new behavior is proper.Less than half way through the movie my 10 year old daughter leaned in to me and said This one isn't funny like the first one is it? She was quite right as a whole this wasn't a funny movie. There was too much meanness and too many dire situations for it to be considered funny.This cast deserved better and Emma Thompson did not deliver a viable story. Though I must say we LOVED Maggie Smith's character and her surprise revelation at the end.This movie on it's own ranks a 4 or 5 but this movie as a sequel ranks only a 3.".

Nanny McPhee says goodbye to Aggie and Aggie pulls a little silver rattle out of her dress pocket it clicked to me and to other fans of the first movie that Maggie Smith is playing a full grown version of Baby Agatha from the first movie. I suggest seeing the first movie before the second one because it's okay standalone but there's at least one reference to the previous movie.

This gal warts and all has a magic cane she thumps on the ground to keep children behaving nicely if persuasion doesn't help. Before long Nanny M has settled disputes amongst the cousins and aids the children in rescuing the piglets when Phil lets them out. But with continuing money problems a missing in action father and Phil's tricks can the family make it through the harvest? This lovely film is a joy. Many thanks to Emma T who not only stars but wrote and produced it too. The other cast members including Gyllenhaal Smith Ifans Ralph Fiennes the talented children and all of the others do the film justice too. McGregor's role is almost a cameo but he's there when it counts. Then too the English countryside is gorgeous the muddy farm not withstanding and the cinematography is very fine indeed. Therefore the flick is also a feast for the eyes. Costumes and makeup are wonderful also for Gyllenhaal looks so pretty with her bright baby blues and sweetness. The plot is fun and full of life and so is the snappy direction. So in spite of being a sequel this movie can stand alone and very well. Nevertheless a backtoback viewing of both films will be nice in the near future. Thank you dear Emma for giving us these two lovely movies. They are smart funny magical offer great life lessons and are a splendid return on money spent.".

However I would say this sad part was in a word cruel SPOILER during a picnic a telegram arrives saying that soldier Dad was killed in action bummer! The children don't believe he is dead so the boys visit the War Office to find out for sure turns out the telegram was a forgery by Mom's evil brother so he could get her to sell the family farm. Quite shiy for a kid's story eh? This was a big wet blanket compared to the rest of the film's highjinks. I almost forgot a stray enemy bomb falls into their barley field unexploded and the children rush over to disarm it. Good parenting. Are the kids successful or not?

	schema:reviewBody "The immensely talented Emma Thompson returns to play and write the story of the ultimately wonderful yet outwardly repulsive nanny of the film's title who assists another desperate single parent by taming their mischievous bunch of spirited youngsters.The lovely Mrs Green a perfectly charming Maggie Gyllenhaal becomes burdened with looking after the family estate a farm in the English countryside and her sister's children Eros Vlahos and Rosie TaylorRitson as well as her own Asa Butterfield Oscar Steer and Lil Woods when her husband a wordless yet productive Ewan McGregor goes to war.The children take advantage of her current frenzied state by squabbling playing dangerously making a mess of the house and just generally misbehaving. There is also her scheming brotherinlaw Phil Rhys Ifans at his erratic despicable scraggly best seizing opportunities to prise the ownership of the farm out of her hands and into those of two ghastly female brutes a spinetingling pair of Katy Brand and Sinead Matthews actually evoke sympathy for the villainous Phil who are relentlessly terrorising him.To add to her stress her elderly employer Mrs Docherty a delightfully senile Maggie Smith cannot be left alone in her own shop for fear of disaster.These are all perfect conditions for the snagtoothed hag with that distinctive silhouette to walk into and she does just as things are at their most chaotic.There is no doubt that the cast are superb and the undisputed highlight of the whole picture. Thompson's reprisal of the role is a joy to behold with all of the wisdom and subtlety that we saw before but this time showing more of a range as she experiments with comic moments and more human emotions. Here we also begin to see more of the extent of her mysteriousness. The children also have wonderful chemistry and emit infinite sparkling charm and innocence with every frame.Though if only Thompson's acting was again as sharp as her writing or if only director Kirk Jones had also returned to the project to guide her. The new setting is quite unsuitable and derails the film in many ways. Gone is the cosy small English village of the original. Gone also is the simplicity the warmth the storytelling magic that seeps through from Christianna Brand's original storybooks. These are all sorely missed as well as those wonderful original characters  Mr Brown Aunt Adelaide Evangeline Mrs Blatherwig Simon...  and the outstanding actors who played them with such liveliness  Colin Firth Angela Lansbury Kell Macdonald Imelda Staunton Thomas Sangster...  who inarguably surpass the new faces however delightful they may be. It might have been thought that bringing them all back would have been tacky but that would merely have been more faithful to the books in which Nurse Matilda makes recurring visits to the Brown household after the children have gone back to their old ways. There is however a single scene containing this precious nuance and poignancy with Ralph Fiennes excelling as a distant father hardened by the war.Another of the original 2005 film's many virtues was its wealth of subplots and dimensions. Clearly this multilayered quality has been attempted to replicate but here the layers that have been added on top of the children's lessons are incredibly hackneyed and childish. It is of course a children's film but Nanny McPhee had an appeal to adults as well as children while Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang is more juvenile than it needs to be. Phil's efforts to obtain the farm for his tormentors is a typical sidenarrative seen countless times earlier as is that of the longlast father gone to war. Indeed the incorporation of World War II shows enormous misjudgement with the heavily restricting boundaries of a film for small children preventing the huge event from being done justice.The nauseatingly corny and clichd excuse for a climax is the icing on the cake of Susanna White's horribly naive direction which unfortunately  together with Thompson's rather sloppy script  represses her and the rest of the remarkably adept cast tragically capping their potential.Still it makes for some amiably enjoyable kids fodder and thankfully it did not keep Thompson from finishing her role in the Harry Potter series.".

They will enjoy it but the potential for the adults to enjoy it goes out of the window after you have seen all the actor enter. It just doesn't have any real depthplot or point to it. One of the biggest gripes with this is the cast is excellent so it annoys me to see Rhys Ifans Ewan McGregor Bill BaileyMaggie Smith Katy Brand and obviously Emma Thompson all just looking like they have turned up for some pocket money or something to do for a couple of weeks. I mean that cast is superb and better than some of the huge blockbusters that are out. But when the story is just plain dull the saying comes to mind that you cant make a xxxx beautiful. LOLPersonally I actually didn't mind the first film As I'm more of a thrillerhorror kind of guy because it had a point to it. With a single father looking after 7 children who are running wild and scaring off every nanny that he hires. So McPhee enters and saves the day. But this didn't have a point. It just had a family effected by the war were the father is away all the time so the children have to and seemed keen enough to help out around the farm. I mean looking into it they seemed happy enough and did more work and appreciated family values than most kids in the world today. The mother leaves them at home every day to go work in the local shop so they completely run the whole farm by themselves. So just because some city children turn up and they have a bit of a fight with the culture clashes that means that they need good ole Nanny McPhee to sort em out. UH?? A good slap and early bed I say. DONE!! No need for the film. P.S I don't condone violence to childrenThe only good thing this film offers is the swimming pigs which my nieces cant stop chatting about and thought it was the best bit of the film. So did I to be fair. But thats about as much magic and fun there is in this film. My Nieces were quite positive about the film overall and were pleased to of watched it but I feel that kids films should appeal or at least create some entertainment for the adults. who pay for the tickets in the first place I think most kids will enjoy this film but its no epic. If Nanny McPhee were a TV series then this would be the rubbish one where she fixes a family who don't really need fixing. Oh and also there isn't a BIG BANG!!!!!".

The script equally so with Emma Thompson mugging her way through the story as a female Roger Moore that is she thinks she can portray all kinds of feelings and emotions by raising an eyebrow. Trust me she can't! What annoyed me most about this mishmash was the whole 1950's Enid Blyton view of England. That is except this is set in 1940's England during World War II and noone except for maybe Maggie Gyllenhall has a 1940's haircut! Maybe that's a small thing but if they are going to set a movie someplace in time then maybe they should at least adhere to the small facts? Maggie Gyllenhall's English accent is superb in fact I spent a good part of the first half of the movie trying to work out where I'd seen her before she was that good.Ralph Fiennes wasted. Sam Kelly doing an English version of his 'Tler character from 'Allo 'Allo. Ewen McGregor coming on at the end to snog Maggie.Sorry superb cast. Totally wasted!".

The plot starts similar to the first one with naughty kids nanny Mcphee's first method at punishing them and teaching them to be better behaved is overly violent and psychologically distressing. Things then get very random indeed things are fleetingly mentioned and then get forgotten about. Things appear for no reason and no explanation. Now kids will actually enjoy this as they will find these sort of things fun and cute. For an older member of the family they will be totally confused.Overall I thought the SFX was weak and the second half of the film lacked much of Nanny Mcphee's character yeah she was there but didn't say or do much. The story took a turn randomly which wasn't a problem really except they seemed to leave out a proper ending. Overall I think kids will enjoy it as its quirky and fast paced but really makes no sense and is very disjointed.

On the second night we decided to painfully watch the rest in an effort to give it a fair shot. That didn't pan out the way we wished. It was hopeless so we turned off the movie completely.I didn't care for the weird way the movie decided to take place during WWII. I didn't find any humor in the supposed humorous parts such as the synchronized swimming of pigs. I didn't care for the uncle who wanted to rob his brother's family of any type of fortune for their farm.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the trailer for this sequel to the kids film based on the children's stories and to me it looked like it was going to be lame but then I saw the critics rating ti quite high so I watched it. Basically young Isabel Green Maggie Gyllenhaal lives on her family farm with her three troublesome children Norman Asa Butterfield Megsie Lil Woods and Vincent Oscar Steer and she also runs a village shop with Mrs. Docherty Dame Maggie Smith. Sent from London to live on the farm I guess because of the war are the children's spoilt cousins the Grays Cyril Eros Vlahos and Celia Rosie TaylorRitson and the misbehaving only gets worse for Isabel. So in comes Nanny McPhee Emma Thompson to teach the children the valuable lessons to behaving well and learning to get on with each other. The first lesson is to stop fighting each other which she does by making them all hit themselves against their will and this makes a wart disappear. The next lesson is to share with each other i.e. beds and she makes them sleep next to the animals they name they would rather be sharing with including a pig and a baby elephant and this makes her other wart disappear. While learning these lesson the mean Phil Green Rhys Ifans is trying to buy the farm off Isabel since her husband Rory Ewan McGregor has been fighting in the war so long but she won't give in. The children's third lesson appears when Nanny McPhee makes all the pigs go wild and try escape and they must learn to work together to catch and sell them to Farmer Macreadie Bill Bailey they do and her unibrow disappears. Going on a picnic Isabel receives the news that Rory has been killed in action which Norman does not believe so Nanny McPhee takes him and Vincent to the war office to confirm this while Isabel is tempted to sell the farm to Phil. Norman confirms from Vincent's father Lord Gray Ralph Fiennes that his father is only missing in action and the letter was forged by Phil who gets handcuffed to a rail in the house. A big problem pops up when a bomb is dropped from the sky due to a pilot sneezing on the trigger and the children work together to defuse it another lesson learnt and Nanny McPhee's hair goes from grey to brown. In the end the final lesson of having faith is learnt when Rory comes home alive and well and Nanny McPhee with her smaller nose walks away as they want her but no longer need her. Also starring Sinead Matthews as Miss Topsey Katy Brand as Miss Turvey Nonso Anozie as Sergeant Jeffreys 'Allo 'Allo's Sam Kelly as Mr. Docherty and Plus One's Daniel Mays as Blenkinsop. Once again Thompson does well as the magical almost anti Mary Poppins and Gyllenhaal sports a pretty good English accent there was a tiny part thinking it is almost the same film again but it is a much more interesting film and the kids will love it a worthwhile period fantasy adventure. Good!".

When Al sees Steven Nebraska pitch in a Mexican league ball game he realizes this is going to be his redemption. Not only is he a great pitcher but can that man belt home runs out of the ball park!As Al stages a test to show the different major league teams what Steve can do Steve Nebraska proves to be the man they all have been waiting for. He is signed for an awful lot of money but he must pass a sanity test in order to join the team. No sweat! Al gets the name of a psychiatrist out of the Yellow Pages who turns out to be Al's worst nightmare. Dr. Aaron discovers Steve is an abused child that has a lot to deal with.Michael Ritchie directed this funny comedy. Albert Brooks contributed to the screen play he cowrote with Andrew Bregman and Monica Johnson. Mr. Brooks plays Al Percolo the scout of the title with his usual style that makes him one of the best actors working in comedies these days. Brendan Fraser is Steve Nebraska a complex man who loves to play baseball but has too many unresolved issues to deal with. The amazing Dianne Wiest plays Dr. Aaron who injects a shot of reality into the movie. There are some funny moments in the film. One of the best involves Tony Bennett who is performing in a night club where Steve and Al have been invited by the Yankee management. When Tony Bennett introduces young Steve Nebraska as the next Yankee star the young man takes a bout and decides to lead the house in a rendition of I Left my Heart in San Francisco. The other great moment occurs when Mr. Bennett shows up to sing the National Anthem at the start of a World Series game and he sees Steve and he asks him is he is going to have the whole stadium sing.There have been other great baseball pictures. This one doesn't try to be one of them. It's just a light movie done for laughs and the mistake most viewers make is to expect it to be what it never intended to be.".

	schema:reviewBody "Al Albert Brooks is at the moment a hapless scout for the New York Yankees. His last sure thing pitcher tossed his cookies on the mound in front of the huge crowd just before he bolted for the turnpike. Al is sent to Mexico this time and not in any known territory. Unbelievably in the Mexican hinterland an American named Steve Nebraska is just waiting for Al to discover him. And what a discovery! Steve can pitch at 106 miles an hour and hit a baseball over 600 feet even if he is a bit weird. Al brings Steve back to NY and the Yankees most impressed sign him on one condition. Nebraska must pass a psychological examination! Can he do it? Will the shrink dandily named H. Aaron help? The premise of this movie along with Albert Brooks' fine performance are enough to sustain this movie to the end. Fraser also does another fine turn as the freaky kid on the block. But one can not help but say what if. There are several loose ends that just never get tied and the result is a good movie but not a great one. Bull Durham Major League and It Happens Every Spring now these are fine baseball movies. This one just doesn't measure up. Still if you are a baseball movie fan you will want to see this one sure. This film is loaded with good ideas that are worth exploring and jabbering about. Stock up on hotdogs and colas and invite the baseball buddies over for a screening.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all let's deal with the fact that this movie isn't at all about baseball.  Not in any real sense of the sport  it's more of a wry comedy that Albert Brooks specializes in. Brendan Fraser stars in the type of role he'd spend the next few years of his career perfecting  the lovable doofus who doesn't quite have a clue but is impossible to truly dislike.  He's Steve Nebraska  uberprospect baseball pitcher who has found his life and career derailed and ends up pitching semipro baseball in Mexico.  Brooks is a baseball scout on the downside of his career in purgatory south of the border when he discovers the immensely talented  but quite immature  Nebraska.  He sees this as his ticket back to the bigtime and shops his pitching prospect around the majors eventually signing with the Yankees where Nebraska makes his debut in the World Series.Now is when this film careens towards the edge and drives off a cliff. It's not about baseball fine. But it involves baseball to a heavy degree even including several major leaguers and baseball people in cameos.  The climactic scene takes place in Yankee Stadium during the World Series. It may not be a sports movie but it owes its entire premise to the sport of baseball and as a result owes that game a semblance of respect. What it ends up doing is shafting the game so completely and making such a mockery of baseball that it ruins whatever it had built up through the rest of the film.There is simply no excuse for building Steve Nebraska as the greatest pitcher ever  a guy who not only throws 110 mph and knocks over his catcher AND the umpire with pitches but also hits like Barry Bonds.  A guy whose first ever major league appearance is in Game One of the World Series  not only a ludicrous prospect for dramatic purposes but completely impossible in real life the rules of baseball don't allow this discussion ends there.  A guy whose debut game consists of throwing 81 straight fastballs past major league hitters  none of whom even so much as make contact  and who throws all of them at 110 mph.  Infamous point  the last pitch is FASTER than the first pitch.  Physics dictate a guy like this would completely shred his rotator cuff labrum muscles and probably destroy every ligament in his elbow.  Not to mention any major league lineup worth its salt for instance one playing in the World Series would sit on this guy's fastball and absolutely torch him the second time through the order.Is this nitpicking? I don't think so.  The Scout may be better judged as a comedy than a baseball movie but it can't totally remove itself from the sporting aspect. I think that any movie that involves baseball as heavily as The Scout does owe it to its audience   as well as its subject matter  to make some slightest bit of effort to craft something that doesn't insult fans of the game.  You can make sentimental stories that use baseball as a backdrop  and involve legendarily talented players  that don't mock the game and flip it the middle finger.  The Natural comes to mind.As a comedy it's average.  As a baseball movie it's completely insulting and awful.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Scout is one of those sports movies that gets it right in enough ways to make it watchable but gets it wrong enough to make you cringe in more spots than you'd like. Brendan Fraser is really terrific as the dopey wideeyed innocent of a pitcher who becomes the subject of a massive game of tug of war at first between teams to see who signs him and then between his love of baseball and his fear of failure. His career has flourished thanks to roles like this the downy innocent amid a swamp of leaches.  This part of the movie is really good. The huge overexaggerated bidding war between baseball clubs for his service it all is real enough to be familiar and satirical enough to really make fun of and kind of predict baseball's current situation in which money has become more and more the driving force behind the game.  The movie also has a bevvie of terrific cameos like Bret Saberhagen Keith Hernandez who oddly seem mistcast as Mets stars in a movie that circles around the Yankees and of course a small but prominant role for Yankee owner George Steinbrenner.  But in the end all of this winds into a ridiculous debut outing in the first game of the World Series. Let's start with the fact that you can't just join the roster in the World Series. It doesn't work that way. No matter how touted you are no team will carry a pitcher on their postseason roster and no if you're not on that roster the whole way you cannot join it who won't pitch unless you get the Series.  It doesn't work that way. And his 81 pitch 81 strike perfect game is ludicrous.  I mean completely preposterous.  This is a movie that gets so much right in its satire of the game's economics the Yankees winning the bidding war here is a nice little nod to the current situation where the Yankees are hated throughout the baseball world for their tossing around of money as if it were the fake paper stuff you get with a Monopoly board and gets so much wrong in the baseball sense. In how good Steve Nebraska Fraser is all sense of realism is throw horribly out the window and the movie becomes little more than a silly baseball movie. As a Yankee fan and a fan of the game itself i expect better of a baseball movie.".

Seeing as how there have only been 17 perfect games in history one would highly doubt a 1st ever start would be a perfect game. 5 81 strikes in a row...nobody even hit a ball? A World Series caliber team can't ONCE key in to a 110 mile per hour fastball to make even accidental contact once?Most idiotic movie regarding baseball of all time.";

As one of our great comic screen writers Brooks delivers some witty lines now and then particularly in the first part of the film.

There's next to know explanation andor resolution to his emotional storyline and although the wonderful Diane Wiest as his psychiatrist is on the team she barely makes it to the warmup spot and pretty much fades out without much ado. Screenwriter Brooks keeps tossing tantalizing hints into Frasier's emotional mix  the laundry concerns for example  but then does nothing with them.

Some comic actors feel the need be goofy in order to be funny.  I don't believe comedy works that way.  I believe the more serious you are in a scene the funnier you are.  As a matter of fact comic actors need to be more serious in scene than dramatic actors.  And Brooks is dead serious in portraying his characters.  It's the fact that he's ranting and raving like a maniac while keeping a straight face that makes the scenes incredibly hilarious.  So for everyone who's a fan of his comedy you should feel right at home. There's tons of hilarious lines and tons of hilarious gags.  Of course the story is predictable like most sports movies so don't expect any big surprises.  And I felt Brendan Fraser's character was underwritten.  But just see the movie for Albert Brooks.  You should have a wonderful time!  I can't wait to see his next movie The Wedding Party where he costars with Michael Douglas.  I just saw the trailer this weekend. My score  8 out of 10".

The film is thoroughly predictable with no twists or surprises at all and an ending that still leaves some key issues unexplained again like The Natural it ends rather abruptly. I can't say what they issues are at the risk of writing spoilers although I don't know how you can spoil a film this simple.In the beginning of the film the scout brings in Michael Rapaport as his star player before Rapaport flakes out. Now if he had brought in Fraser and then later on had Rapaport playing Fraser's part this film might have been one of the better baseball movies ever made.

Cameos of such TV celebrity as Bob Costas Joe Torrey and Ozzie Smith. It starts in New York and travels to Mexico and back to New York. No gratuitous sex scenes but if you're a guy that loves baseball you probably will forgive the film makers.

	schema:headline " Overlooked late 80s flick";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is remembered well from when I was 14. It's another film that got hidden away from the mainstream 21st century movie world. Just one of the guys is another example of that and both that and this film I have never found on DVD in any stores. Too many people find them both B movies and B movies from that era don't make it to the 21st century like the A movies do. Examples of B movies from 80s the two I already mentioned Frog My stepmother was an alien The invisible kid The boy who could fly Killer klowns from outer space walk like a man and others. Examples of 80s A movies Back to the future Ferris Bueller The breakfast club Weird science Sixteen candles Big Rain man Batman Twins and many others. Opportunity knocks was in my opinion a very good film with con man Dana Carvey and is less talked about than the much inferior more stupid Dana Carry con man film 2002's Master of disguise. Dana and partner Todd Graff are con partners who are basically still on the lower end of the ladder but wishing to climb up it. They owe 750 to big guy Pinky another ironic gangster name common thing in these kind of films. Pinky works for big mob boss Sal James Tolkan Mr Strickland from Back to future films . They really land onto Sal's hit list after stealing his car abandoning it and allowing it to get vandlelised plus 60 grand in cash being stolen from trunk. Dana and Todd now with Sal having bullets with their names on them flee and end up breaking into a nice upper middle class house whos owner David is on a three month vacation to India. Along the way are several comical skits from Dana including a couple more India references an Indian accent with an attitude another Indian accent with Leprosy a gas furnace repair man scam and a jump in front of a car scam all for chump change. Dana wants to move up in the world and with aid from his retired big league con man uncle he gets his chance in the big leagues himself. He takes the nice house of David and poses as his old college buddy Johnathan since Dana overhears how David's real buddy Johnathan who was gonna house sit dropped out last minute to take some big money making job. There Johnathan meets David's parents Milt Robert Loggia and his wife Mona. Things really take off from there and Dana really starts living it up with his new false yuppie lifestyle with everyone in Dave's family being none the wiser to his scheme. That includes beauty Ann who really falls for his so called educated worldly witty big business man position in life. I would not necessarily say that David's family is dumb for falling for his charade since he really pulls it off quite convincingly. There are some very good scenes and a few dumb ones while Dana is mascarading as Johnathan. The good scenes involve DanaJohnathan going to Milt and Mona's country club for lunch while Dana gets to work with some very amusing lines the Chatuea la fete wine scene the comment to the host where does one go to drain the lizard? Dana to Milt after the waiter pours his wine is he gonna come by and burp me too? Dana to Milt after Milt starts talking heavy business that Johnathan would know about but not Dana I think we're boring the ladies. Mona Thank you Johnathan.. More good scenes and lines come while Dana Johnathan is at Milt's office such as the conversation with the Japanese man about the Malcolm blowers the George Bush scene at the stadium bathroom the barmitzva the entire plot with Sal getting set up by Dana and his uncle posing as government building commissioner and some of the scenes while he's getting romantically attached with Ann.The couple of dumb scenes are the scene with DanaJohnathan in the company bathroom telling everyone that the bathroom is the place where people come up with the best business ideas and then the way Milt and everyone cheer him for that. Seriously? The other very bad scene the worst one is Dana Johnathan singing Born to be wild at a club as Wildman. The way he sang it the way he danced especially that erotic crawl on the ground towards the audience and the way the audience including the guys were screaming and reaching their arms out at him like the girls did at Elvis concerts. Are you serious!? It was embarrassingly awful to watch. And also the way everyone called him Wild man and Pinky seeing him and trying to come after him. Awful the whole scene. This paragraph here is the reason I subtracted points from my review. But the other 7 points are from how well the rest of the film was.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film is remembered well from when I was 14. It's another film that got hidden away from the mainstream 21st century movie world. Just one of the guys is another example of that and both that and this film I have never found on DVD in any stores. Too many people find them both B movies and B movies from that era don't make it to the 21st century like the A movies do. Examples of B movies from 80s the two I already mentioned Frog My stepmother was an alien The invisible kid The boy who could fly Killer klowns from outer space walk like a man and others. Examples of 80s A movies Back to the future Ferris Bueller The breakfast club Weird science Sixteen candles Big Rain man Batman Twins and many others. Opportunity knocks was in my opinion a very good film with con man Dana Carvey and is less talked about than the much inferior more stupid Dana Carry con man film 2002's Master of disguise. Dana and partner Todd Graff are con partners who are basically still on the lower end of the ladder but wishing to climb up it. They owe 750 to big guy Pinky another ironic gangster name common thing in these kind of films. Pinky works for big mob boss Sal James Tolkan Mr Strickland from Back to future films . They really land onto Sal's hit list after stealing his car abandoning it and allowing it to get vandlelised plus 60 grand in cash being stolen from trunk. Dana and Todd now with Sal having bullets with their names on them flee and end up breaking into a nice upper middle class house whos owner David is on a three month vacation to India. Along the way are several comical skits from Dana including a couple more India references an Indian accent with an attitude another Indian accent with Leprosy a gas furnace repair man scam and a jump in front of a car scam all for chump change. Dana wants to move up in the world and with aid from his retired big league con man uncle he gets his chance in the big leagues himself. He takes the nice house of David and poses as his old college buddy Johnathan since Dana overhears how David's real buddy Johnathan who was gonna house sit dropped out last minute to take some big money making job. There Johnathan meets David's parents Milt Robert Loggia and his wife Mona. Things really take off from there and Dana really starts living it up with his new false yuppie lifestyle with everyone in Dave's family being none the wiser to his scheme. That includes beauty Ann who really falls for his so called educated worldly witty big business man position in life. I would not necessarily say that David's family is dumb for falling for his charade since he really pulls it off quite convincingly. There are some very good scenes and a few dumb ones while Dana is mascarading as Johnathan. The good scenes involve DanaJohnathan going to Milt and Mona's country club for lunch while Dana gets to work with some very amusing lines the Chatuea la fete wine scene the comment to the host where does one go to drain the lizard? Dana to Milt after the waiter pours his wine is he gonna come by and burp me too? Dana to Milt after Milt starts talking heavy business that Johnathan would know about but not Dana I think we're boring the ladies. Mona Thank you Johnathan.. More good scenes and lines come while Dana Johnathan is at Milt's office such as the conversation with the Japanese man about the Malcolm blowers the George Bush scene at the stadium bathroom the barmitzva the entire plot with Sal getting set up by Dana and his uncle posing as government building commissioner and some of the scenes while he's getting romantically attached with Ann.The couple of dumb scenes are the scene with DanaJohnathan in the company bathroom telling everyone that the bathroom is the place where people come up with the best business ideas and then the way Milt and everyone cheer him for that.

I can't pick just one thing I like so much about him. He's an incredibly gifted individual. His impressions have always been fantastic and the way he delivers his material absolutely kills me. He's one of only a handful of comics that have brought me to tears. With that said Opportunity Knocks worked really well for him. It allowed him to use his creativity in his character Eddie. Whether it's his impersonations or his physical comedy he shows it throughout the film. Is Opportunity Knocks a brilliant film with Oscar winning performances?? Of course not. It's just a fun movie that allows Carvey to show off his silly humor and it has a nice warm story beneath the surface. I have always enjoyed Opportunity Knocks since the 1st time I saw it in 1990. I own the movie and have watched it countless times. It definitely holds tremendous nostalgic value to me so it's a comfort flick for me in a lot of ways. If you don't care for Dana Carvey's comedy then u prob won't really appreciate this film. However if you're like me and like Carvey then you'll certainly enjoy this more...than any of his others. Dana is more Dana in this flick than any other movie he's done. I wish Universal would release this movie on Bluray Disc...I'd add it to my Bluray movie library in a second.".

Apart from the fact that it stars thenhot Saturday Night Live star Dana Carvey it has the general feel of an 80's comedy though it was actually released early in 1990.Carvey plays a struggling conman who charms his way into the lives of an upper class family after they mistake him for a friend of their son. He soon hits it off with both the businessman father Robert Loggia and the reserved daughter Julia Campbell though his growing attachment is destined to end in the exposure of his deception. To make matters worse he's got a dangerous loan shark hounding him for 60000 that he doesn't have.The acting is mostly decent but certainly nothing to write home about. Carvey gets ample opportunity to showcase his varied comedic skills though he could have used some better writing to work with. Robert Loggia  Julia Campbell both do well in their respective roles but the rest of the cast is unremarkable at best and below par at worst.Donald Petrie's direction is capable but not particularly memorable. He's actually directed a few above average romcoms in his career but this one isn't one of them. The soundtrack includes a couple of good selections but these are overshadowed by some dated music and an embarrassing karaoke rendition of Born to be Wild.Ultimately Opportunity Knocks is a passable timewaster but it too often strays into clich and unbelievability. Even as a Dana Carvey vehicle it pales next to the Wayne's World movies which were yet to come.".

Review the movie's elements cinematography editing music etc. It's smooth cute and smart. The feel good movies of the 1980s were the nicest.

Why make things so complicated? Apparently the only reason is to make us loathe them even more but it comes across as another example of just too dumb to believe. A cheap ploy by a film that tries to take itself way too seriously.

However joining the pieces of the puzzle that compose the story later I found it a reasonable film at least the intentions of the writers are good. But the tagline says that the road to hell is paved of good intentions and the screenplay does not work well.

	schema:reviewBody "What I loved about this film was its seamy gritty portrayal of man's darker side. It is rare for a movie to probe that area of human nature. The happygolucky Hollywood ending has become so clich that it appears nobody wants to delve into the tragic aspect of life. But as a person who has lived in that reality for most of his life I very much appreciate when directors writers and actors are willing to explore the lonely sadness the vulnerability behind the hard mask the hot desire for vengeance and even the hopeless drive towards suicide that define a part of what it means to be human. The Law brothers clearly were writing with that intention and I applaud them for it.What I disliked about this film was that despite covering such a rarely explored side of human nature the Hollywood clichs sporadically broke through. The early action sequences were perfect short explosive and tight. The final action sequence on the other hand fell into standard format big long shootout hero outruns some bullets cops show up and the extras get shot bad guy runs off and the hero gives chase leading to a final confrontation etc. In fairness however big points need to be given for lots of unorthodox things. The primary antagonist role switched three times as each was killed off. And as mentioned in another review there was great attention to detail with regard to reloading guns and such which I assume is a credit to director Brian Smrz's vast experience as a stunt man. Ultimately this picture seemed like it was being pulled in two directions. On the one hand it seems to have been written as a very dark examination of a troubled character seeking revenge and even more poignantly his own death. And similarly it seems the director had some uncommonly good ideas for the film. But then somewhere along the way the film kept being pulled back to standard action movie hackneyed themes and theatrical devices. And of course the out of place happy ending had to be tacked onto the end and yet even that had a darkness to it. It's as if the producers and the writers were constantly fighting with the director stuck in the middle and only a few victories to each side.My opinion follows this duality. I loved the story that was underneath. I survived the parts added over it that seemed so untrue to its nature. The acting was fine to good and it'd have been a pretty good film if the final action sequence and the last minute hadn't ruined it.".

I found myself trying to anticipate the next connection of pass and present. Cuba Gooding Jr. did a good job of portraying a man tortured with his pass and present. I do have to take exception to the bar scenes though. I'm not sure that Ray Liota needed to bulk up for the part but he did. Jean Smart had me kind of wondering what was going to happen in the apartment scene. Although there is predominately a U.S. cast I think the feel of the movie was off because it was filmed in eastern Europe. Straight to DVD but worth the watch in my opinion.".

The characters are interesting but much of their development depends on plot elements that didn't really make too much sense. Still if you're more interested in the themes and characters than you are in the actual plot this movie can work for you.The story is kind of interesting but it's a bit complicated. Basically Cuba Gooding Jr plays a depressed loser who seeks meaning in his life after terrible loss. Finding his inspiration he is torn between seeking redemption and revenge when it is taken away from him. Sounds kind of interesting right? Well the execution is a bit flawed but I did appreciate the attempt to give me more than a basic streamlined revenge movie.Cuba Gooding Jr has done quite a few of these directtovideo action movies and all have been flawed in some way. Still I like him and Ray Liotta enough that I'll continue to watch them even though they tend to get rated rather poorly on the IMDb. If you're the same way then I recommend Hero Wanted. If not maybe it's best that you just avoid it.".

There are some unrealistic moments  major injuries have much lesser effect on the guy who sustained them... On the other hand I liked very much the gunplay because in real life not many people are good shots especially when in combat situation i.e. when the target is in fact shooting back. The characters were reloading often enough the slides were remaining in rear position after the last shell has been ejected and shooting both guns simultaneously resulted in hitting nothing. Cool. There is even a moment where a guy is teaching the main character how to shoot and tells him forget about the movies.... now support the bottom of your gun with your left hand and don't pull the trigger.. squeeze it!

I wonder if this is the kind of future the young Liotta saw for himself when on the set of Scorsese's Goodfellas a succession of mostly lame and formulaic crime thrillers with few redeeming features.Cuba Gooding takes centre stage as Liam Case a garbage man who enjoys the kind of luck that would have most people reaching for the prozac his wife and kid drown in a car crash from which he is unable to save them and the new woman of his dreams ends up with a bullet hole in the head that sends her into a coma. Director Smrz unwisely chooses to play with the chronology of events for no apparent reason other than he's seen it done before and evidently thinks its cool. It used to be cool now it's become dull through its overuse by directors who don't realise it's nothing more than a gimmick with the shortest of shelf lives.Fortunately for Smrz he doesn't have to hold his hand up to the increasingly ridiculous twists inserted into the story in an attempt to keep the viewer interested. Case has to be one of the most pathetic heroes we have seen in a long time. The guy actually thinks the best way to get to know that woman of his dreams who happens to be a bank teller is to get his friend to stage a robbery so that he can play the hero. I mean come on that should be the pitch for a comedy not a 'serious' thriller.As the film grows increasingly lost the writers throw every clich they can think of into the mix and in the end we end up with a young kid talking and thinking like an adult while holding a gun on the bad guys.This is weak and lazy filmmaking in nearly every way imaginable.".

I could feel myself cringe as the melodramatic tones of 'cheesy' jazz would play over the lonely scenes with Liam Case Cuba battling with his emotions before embarking on a revenge trip.

Even Cuba Gooding's acting ability couldn't break through the thickly spread seedy jazz tones inexperienced camera work and poor acting talents.Worth watching for the story maybe..... But leave all movie taste at the front door.";

After an hour runtime logic and normal human thinking is in freefall. I won't describe it in detail because I could write about every minute from an hour till the end.As an example I'll take the hostage scene at the end. The bad guys had plenty of opportunities to kill the main character LIAM  but they preferred to let him kill some of them first  before they are taking a hostage and are luring him out to a showdown. It doesn't matter that the bad guys had no problem to find him regularly before this incident  but now they need a hostage?? The hostage itself is another example how bad the story is. LIAM is a lonely guy so who is gonna be a hostage? The script author had to construct a car crash with a young girl  who LIAM could rescue and build a friendship. Another nonsense scene with the young girl was  when she came to LIAM's car in the middle of the street at night and alone.And young is here not 16 or 15 the girl looks like 8 or 10 years old! It is really obvious how the script author had to construct the scene with the rescue of the young girl only to get his hostage so cheap and artificial  just horrible. You can watch this movie if you are male your girlfriend is out of town you have drunk some beerthe night is nearyou love Bmovieshave no possibility to get a good movie and you just need some company from the TV. The only other possible audience tasteless and dumb human beings! I can't imagine why people are giving this movie ratings higher than 6 or are describing the story as good? How can you compare a rating of 10 for this movie with a great movie like DEATH SENTENCE?Now this movie has an average rating of above 6 but I am certain that when the hardcore Cuba Gooding fans are gone the rating will fall down like a stone.".

This was a really interesting story with some unexpected twists and turns. It was a pretty good film that really fell under the radar. The story was great and the acting was top notch but the way it was filmed really left a lot to be desired. The film is frequently jumping months ahead or to a flashback without any notice or footnotes it made parts of the film very confusing. There were also a couple of pretty big plot holes that added to the confusion. This is by no means a classic but the acting was terrific the action was pretty cool and I enjoyed it quite a bit.".

For the first part of the film I had absolutely no idea what part of the story we were constantly being transported to. With Cuba Gooding's constant commentary droning on throughout the film to try and keep you updated. any film worth its mettle should never have to do this. It was if the writer was trying to make it something special by doing this but instead it just bores you to tears.

Really...it loses it's originality.I remember times when Vancouver would portray New York or Detroit...and while that was not fit either...Bulgaria certainly doesn't cut as inner city America or Canada at all...just the little details that make it not gel.Aside from a few minor things I think it's an overall good production with a great opening shot.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not always a fan of Cuba Gooding Jr's work especially some of his latest works which are just soso in my opinion. But then he'll turn around and do something like his latest flick Hero Wanted.Hero Wanted tells the tale of Liam Case an empty shell of a garbage man who lost the love of his life when he was unable to rescue her in a car accident. Months years later I'm not sure the film doesn't say how much time has passed he rescues a young girl from a flaming car wreck getting injured in the process and later making him the town's local hero. He soon falls in love with a bank teller named Kayla Christa Campbell. And one day Liam gets the nerve to talk to her while she's on duty. But the bank is held up and Kayla gets shot in the process. Liam goes to look in on her and in doing so he gets shot but survives his injuries. Kayla however is in a coma. So Liam decides to go after the guys killing two of them. However the remaining crooks seek vengeance. Now Liam must confront the gangsters ultimately dealing with the choices he made that started it all. But things are more than what they seem as the film unravels. How the plot plays out well if I'd seen this film say ten years ago I wouldn't buy into it. However in our present society and the crazy stuff people have done I kinda find the plot acceptable and believable.The story in Hero Wanted plays out like a puzzle where the entire picture doesn't become clear until all the pieces come together. Everything is played out through flashbacks and watching it the first time is a bit disorienting. The film jumps from the past to the present starting out with the car accident that kills Liam's wife jumping to the present where he's drunk at a bar and getting knocked out by the bartender jumping again to the past where he's mellowing on the couch thinking of his wife and unborn child. This series of back and forth is a bit disorienting because at times you don't know where you are until the scene plays itself out. However you actually benefit with a second viewing because you get a better feel for the film. Yes I had the opportunity to watch it twice and believe me it really is better with the second viewing. Last film I watched like this was Fight Club first sit through was great but man it made my head hurt. The second time you kinda get that oh I get it! feel. Everything builds up to a climatic shoot out with a soso ending. Personally I wanted the film to end right after Liam and Kayla are holding hands and Liam passes out from being shot up with the final words he narrates at the end of the film redemption is a funny thing... Because you just need to know that in the end he's still a hero.I give kudos to director Brian Smrz for handling such a unique approach I know a film such as this couldn't have been easy to handle but I believe he pulled it off. Also a round of applause as this is Brian's first outing as director According to IMDb and I think it's a job well done. Writers Chad Law and Evan Law also deserve some accolades as the writing is tight and the actors handled the dialog with ease everyone falling into their roles nicely.I don't really embrace Cuba in this role. I mean I liked him in the film but I wasn't entirely feeling him you know. I think his voice and his face are just too soft to really bring out the full angst of the character. But I think he's passable as Liam is the kind of guy you wanna feel sorry for be angry at then cheer for all at the same time. There are some scenes such as when Liam talks to Kayla for the first time you feel kind of bad for the guy I mean he looks pitiful and it really tugs at the heart strings.The film is rounded out with a great cast. Ray Liotta makes an appearance as Detective Terry Subcott but he comes off more like comic relief than a serious cop trying to investigate a murder. His character doesn't do a lot and really isn't integral to the story but he hams it up nicely when he on screen. Jean Smart who plays Kayla's mom Melanie also does some fine work. I'll admit I was a big fan of Designing Women and her character Charlene. Looking up her work on IMDb I see she's had an amazing and extensive actingvoice acting career since. And oh my god she still looks darn good although her role is in the film is brief and she gives a darn good performance. Norman Reedus plays Swain I haven't seen this guy since Blade 2 and I really enjoyed his work here in HW. But the best of the bunch is Tommy Flannagan who plays Derek. I love this Scottish basard. The accent really accentuates his role and he is just bad a. I mean anytime Tommy is on screen he shines.Hero Wanted is not the greatest story ever told and it certainly won't win any major awards but it's definitely worth the price admission. With a unique approach some decent acting and a nice chunk of action Hero Wanted is worth picking up. In the end I'm giving Hero Wanted 4 out of 5 stars and it's been Valkor tested TOV approved.".

The road to hell is paved with good intentions...'Well ain't that the truth!?'...even if this film is taking that tagline to the extreme...He seemed a little too trusting a couple of times especially after all the guy had been through... Obviously born from a good script and followed through with good solid directing acting editing art direction etc etc..nobody fell down on this production anywhere making it well worth the time and money...Probably the best 'oneliner' description I can offer is 'edgy and enjoyable from start to finish'...It's got a good 'look' to it as well...one that matches the subject and helps in bringing it all together in a nice coherent finished project... The only other problem I have with this moviereally is with the same one I see in a lot of movies..The portrayal of the 'uniformed' cops...They are represented as complete idiots granted there are some but that's in every profession  can you imagine the majority of people they deal with day in  day out?...From their 1st entry until getting blown to smithereens by automatic rifle...driving right into it getting out of the car then standing there as if trying to get shot!...I mean com'on! these guys do this professionally 5 days a week  8 hours a day...It's their job! I'm pretty sure they pick up a few things along the way...like being somewhat cautious and prepared for criminals with automatic weapons!?!...I mean when was the last time a traffic cop stopped a car without being prepared to pull his pistol? much less pull right into a multigun battle without any knowledge of what's going on and see eager to get shot like paper targets!...It just doesn't happen yet they are continually portrayed as 'complete idiots that can't get their guns out of the holsters' and seem to 'attract bullets like magnets'...It's just always stupidlooking and unrealistic...Lastly since the story was taken to the end...I would have liked to know how much time one has to ponder being a hero...that would have been a nice finishing touch if even given by a V.O or some screennotes just 'something' about what the deal was how long in the suit  chair etc...but I'm just being picky now as I can imagine whatever I want I guess...Regardless this is a 1st rate film that anyone who likes crime dramas can't miss...Id go so far as to say It's the best one I've seen in years.".

Despite Corey Haim presence in the picture the fact that it may have been used to present Haim as some sort of good kid unless he was sadly so desperate for material that he did agree to be in the movie then I'd recommend picking up something else be it a better Haim selection may I even recommend 'Prayer of the Rollerboys' made around the same time or a better teen spy selection altogether as already mentioned.".

He made a big impact on our hearts in the classic Lucas he made a soso appearance in the body swapping fiasco Dream a Little Dream but my favorite was without a doubt the teen driving comedy License to Drive. That's my favorite thing he's done. In the nineties Haim had been victim to a molestation and a drug addict in previous years. His work had become few and far between. Some of his worst stuff came into play like the sequel to Dream a Little Dream 2 and the Godawful comedy Busted. This was before things got real ugly.The Double O Kid was a directtoDVD film that isn't as bad as people say. It's amusing at most but nothing in the field of memorable or even good. It's a typical secret agent actioncomedy. Lance Elliot Haim is a seventeen year old intern. When he is forced to rush a package to LA he figures out that a millionaire virus man and a henchwoman need that package and will stop at nothing to get it. Lance meets Melinda Eggert a sexy woman who has fallen into play with Lance and they both try to outwit the boss at his own game in a fitting end scene.The film is not very creative and does almost nothing to morph the bad guy bad things genre. But we do have a fair amount of decent scenes and Haim doesn't disappoint. This is also one of the three films both Eggert and Haim appeared in together. They had dated for a long period of time and had roles side by side in this Just One of the Girls and Blown Away all of which I reviewed. It may be clich and stock but in points it's satisfying and entertaining.Starring Corey Haim Nicole Eggert John RhysDavies and Brigitte Nielsen. Directed by Duncan McLachlan.".

Even my preteen son didn't like it. I bought it sightunseen since it was only 5.50 and I thought my son would enjoy it. He liked Agent Cody Banks and I figured this would be  not as good  but passable. Anybody want a free DVD? Watched only once. ? OK no takers and I don't blame you. Read the back.

This movie has a little bit of action romance and comedy. It also has the late great Corey Haim in it which also makes this movie good even though it may not be considered one of his better roles. This movie also has a great villain in Cashpot and if you have read my reviews before you will know that I really enjoy movies with great villains in them so that is another reason why this movie deserves more credit than it gets.

While it is silly it's not well done silly.Beyond License to Drive all the Corey Haim comedies are must avoids. Based on other reviews I read. License to Drive Rocks Double O Kid sucks. I saw four other light hearth comedy films with Haim from that area. Not that they are good but they are better. Fast getaway 1 and 2 have much higher productions value. Dream a little 2 and The Dream Machine are more entertaining.I always give a four if the movie managed to have me sit through the whole thing and for that film I can say I am being generous. It was watchable but completely uncreative. All the jokes were things you saw in the three Stooges or any Bugs Bunny cartoon.Another reason I saw this film was because I was curious about the 90's outputs of Corey Haim's after his death. Since I was unfamiliar with those films. Not to put all these effort by him from period down I'll suggest you to watch Oh! What a Night it's a coming of age story of young boy in the 50's. If someone else would be curious about good Corey Haim films from the 90's. But theDouble O Kid doesn't provide.In my opinion what poisoned Haim's career is that they tried to repeat is success that he had in the very good but shallow comedy License to Drive. It's OK to try a new story with the same humor but they fail with the humor. According to most reviewers all the comedies he did in the 90's 90 of his work from this period suck. So if you need an example of bad Corey Haim comedy film from the 90's here you go.Finally the movie is harmless if you have a DVD laying around your house and you have a kid 12 and under. He might actually enjoy it and it's quite respectable family wise in it's content.".

The script is basically the story of U.S. Merchant Marine survivors of a battle determined to sink the ship that ruthlessly cut into their lifeboat. The climax has them getting their revenge on the Germans after a fierce battle that concludes with the Americans and their farewell ceremonies to shipmates killed during battle. Bogart is given some flagwaving lines to read and the film concludes with a commentary using FDR's voice to salute the Merchant Marines and their contribution to the war effort.Lloyd Bacon directs with a firm vigorous treatment of all the battle scenes and only occasionally does the film slow down when dealing with the domestic front. Julie Bishop does a nice job as Bogart's girlfriend and later wife while Raymond Massey shares his domestic homecoming with Ruth Gordon as his wife. But the film's merits are chiefly due to the action sequences which are by far among the best ever featured in a Bogart film.Action is what you get here...but don't expect anything deep. Bogart fans won't be disappointed. Dane Clark plays his usual hothead role with gusto and Alan Hale is a welcome addition to the supporting cast.".

Now these types of films were made in the hundreds in the USA during the war and many of them are pretty forgettable.

Plus in many ways it's similar to the British wartime film IN WHICH WE SERVE 1942but I think that ACTION IN THE NORTH Atlantic is actually a bit better film. Much of this is because the acting is at least equal to the British film Humphrey Bogart and Raymond Massey versus Noel Coward and John Mills in the 1942 film and the story is a bit more exciting in ACTION IN THE NORTH Atlantic. Plus I admired how the often forgotten men of the merchant marine were shown to be heroesafter all a lot of them died transporting supplies to Britain during the war.Both films excelled because unlike some jingoistic wartime films the Allies were NOT shown as superhumans who could do ridiculous things like in the movie AIRFORCE where a B17 shoots down fighter plane after fighter planesomething that just could never have happened. In fact both films feature ships being sunk right out from under the stars in the first half hour of the film! But here's where the films really succeeded as they showed the indomitable human spirit that despite losses continues to bravely and without too much complaint do their job. Balancing this need with the families back at home make these both stellar films. In fact now that I think about it I STRONGLY recommend you see both.

	schema:reviewBody "Action in the North Atlantic a war time tale of 1943 shows great special effects and battle scenes that have a realistic look to them. In fact the film which turned up on cable recently was a total surprise. Director Lloyd Bacon showed a flair with this WWII drama about the men that operated the Merchant Marine.We are taken to the North Atlantic where a group of ships are made to form a convoy hoping that being so close to each other they might be protected from attacks. Little prepared the organizers of this idea for the arrival of the infamous German submarines and planes. The action one sees is centered in the Liberty ship that is heading for the old Soviet Union. The heroic account of what the crew of that ship experienced is a tribute to the courageous men that put their lives in peril in order to get their cargo to the different destinations.Humphrey Bogart as Lt. Joe Rossi makes a great appearance. He is totally believable as the man who takes over for his wounded captain and brings the ship to safety. Raymond Massey plays Capt. Jarvis a man totally dedicated to his profession. Alan Hale Sam Levene and Dane Clark are seen as part of the brave crew of the Liberty. Ruth Gordon and Julie Bishop are the women left behind.The film has a great black and white photography by Ted McCord and a haunting musical score by Adolph Deutsch. The battle scenes were staged by Lloyd Bacon with an uncredited assistance from Raoul Walsh and they are amazing for what was accomplished in those days where the technology wasn't so advanced.".

	schema:reviewBody "This comparatively littleknown film should have done for the Merchant Sailors of WWII what The Cruel Sea did for the image of the Royal Navy. The men who sailed the convoy ships were treated appallingly by the owners of the vessels they crewed who indeed where quick to institute retroactive stoppage of pay clauses upon receiving word of a ship's being lost. They also were subject to verbal even physical abuse by their own countrymen who routinely mistook them for Service Shirkers. Action is one of the few films that gives them their due.This film is remarkable on many counts. Not only is the acting rock solid and the story in itself a fine sea saga but the director has managed to avoid many potential pitfalls thrown into in his path by the War Propaganda? Department. The obligatory leavetaking scenes are touching but not maudlin the even more obligatory speechmaking is impassioned but never embarrassingly so. And the Enemy is portrayed as a thoroughly competent if ruthless professional as dedicated to his own trade as the convoy Sailors are to theirs. I for one did not find the lack of English subtitles a problem I could pretty well figure out what the UBoat skipper and his crew were up to. To repeat my opening comments this film though not as wellcirculated as The Cruel Sea certainly should rank as its equal.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to dislike the Warner Brothers' war movies of the 1940s despite any weaknesses they might have had. They are inexpensive unpretentious and exciting. And like most Warner Brothers flicks they're oriented towards a workingclass audience. No fancy philosophizing no pop psych profundities no ontological Angst.If dis fog gets any thicker we'll have to cut our way through it. Yeah. A good day to be at home with a blond and a book. Oh yeah? When did you loin to read? Who said I could read? But you said  Dissolve There are the usual familiar faces in this one Bogart Massey Alan Hale Dane Clark Sam Levene great as always.Basically the story is that the crew of an American freighter is torpedoed in midAtlantic and their lifeboat is rammed by the submarine. Picked up they later gather and form the crew of a new Liberty ship the Sea Witch and assigned to a large convoy destined for Murmansk USSR. The convoy is attacked by a Nazi wolfpack and scatters. One submarine follows the Sea Witch and radios its position to the Luftwaffe. Two Nazi planes are sent out to strafe and bomb the ship but both are shot down after causing considerable damage to the ship. The airplanes are curiously antiquated looking. I think the models are supposed to represent Heinkel HE 59s. Finally the skulking submarine surface to shoot it out with the Sea Witch fooled into thinking the Liberty ship is mortally wounded by a torpedo. Cf. The Enemy Below. The Sea Witch rams the submarine and sinks her and the German crew dies screaming as water pours in.The men killed at sea are buried with proper ceremony their names and ranks read off one by one  John Murphy Joe Anderson Frank Ribetti Morris Goldberg  and Bogart after reading the burial service throws in his own two cents worth about how it could be any one of us lying there. The screenplay is by John Howard Lawson one of the Hollywood Ten who was blacklisted after the war for his membership in the communist party. The Red propaganda is visible to the naked eye. Lawson has the temerity to suggest that Russia and the USA fought on the same side in World War II. Those Liberty ships manned by civilian merchant seamen were really Doozies. The first series was slapped together by Kaiser. It took a few days to build each ship from keel to tiptoptagallant. They were small unarmed uncomfortable and underpowered. They were built in three modules that were then joined and they had a tendency to come apart at the seams in heavy weather.And the North Atlantic offers what is probably the lousiest weather in the northern hemisphere. The top speed of the ships was about 12 knots. Nicholas Monserrat in his memoirs describes being aboard an escort vessel in a convoy and watching the ships beating against a headwind that reduced their flank speed to that of a man walking.Anyway there is a romance thrown in here so Bogart can be married but it's short unobtrusive and unsentimental. And as in practically unavoidable in films describing duels between ships and submarines there is as much suspense as there is action. At times the sea is more of a threat than the enemy is. The action scenes when they come are fast arousing and a little confusing.As a footnote the Merchant Marine was not well thought of by the Armed Services because as civilians their pay rate was far higher than that of enlisted men. Nevertheless it was extremely dangerous duty and the percentage of men killed at sea was higher than in any branch of the service.A good example of Warners' craftsmanship a simple tale skillfully done.".

It is interesting to note that at the time the film was made America had just come into the war and the script makes several refences as why they are fighting. One touching scene is when Raymond Massey comes home to his wife. The later part of the story is concerned with a large convoy to Murmansk. Even now nearly 50 years after the it was made the film stands up remarkably well including the special effects which are particularly well done.I advise anybodyeven if they are not interested in the last war  to see this film and say a special thanks to the men of the allied merchant navy's. It is pleasing to watch a film about the less glamorous side of the Allied war effort.".

They get a second ship and with some of their surviving crew from the first ship join an international convoy taking supplies to the Soviet Union.From Halifax to Murmansk quite a flotilla of merchant ships from a whole lot of countries that had declared war on the Axis. The convoy was something like a sea going wagon train which was developed because individual ships were easy prey for submarines. The seagoing wagon train got a destroyer escort and they were armed now as well.The merchant seaman were not technically part of the armed forces. But that didn't mean they weren't seeing a lot of action as Action in the North Atlantic so clearly demonstrates. Bad enough when the Lend lease was to Great Britain but when we became allies with the Soviets the only places it could go were the ports of Murmansk and Archangel when they were ice free. That meant a voyage along the long Norwegian coast line which was occupied by Germany.Bogart and Massey give strong portrayals of dedicated merchant seaman whose life is tough enough in peace time. But they certainly have the right stuff in time of war. Some of the crew of their ship is Dane Clark Sam Levene Peter Whitney and Alan Hale who really steals every scene he's in.Action in the North Atlantic is filled with a lot of the flag waving that characterized Hollywood era World War II films. The derring do heroics are kept to a minimum. The situations the seaman encounter are quite real for the perilous undertaking they were involved in.It could probably be remade today and maybe with some of today's stars showing a new generation what it was like to be a merchant seaman in World War II".

The ship is trailed by a German UBoat that is kept at distance during day light but will certainly torpedo them at night and prevents them from rejoining their convoy as they don't want to disclose it's course to the Germans. How they finally go thru alive and reach Murmansk offers many ways to show the heroics of the unlisted merchant sailors who contributed in the same way as the Navy to the victory in war. All that is conveyed very well sometimes to messagelike sometimes to much propaganda but what you expect in 1943 ?. Some fun on the side  In the German dubbed version  all the Germans esp. Pilots and Sub Marine Commanders speak a original non dubbed heavy chewing gum English whereas the Americans speak perfect German. Such is the war in the movies".

	schema:reviewBody "My grandfather went to sea on squareriggers in 1900 and my Dad served as an Able Seaman all through World War 2. He was 400 miles ENE of Honolulu on 12741 and heard the distress calls of the SS Cynthia Olson sunk by a Japanese sub 200 miles North of them and 4 hours before the attack occurred. He went on to see action in the invasions of Attu Kiska North Africa Sicily Salerno Anzio and Iwo Jima. So he had the dubious honor of being shot at by representatives of all Three Axis Powers4 if you count the Vichy French. He told me the following story about seeing this film.He and his shipmate Dudley a fellow San Franciscan had returned to the states after Anzio and were on a bus trip back to San Francisco. They had an overnight stay at some Podunk town in western Nebraska. With nothing else to do they decided to see what was playing at the local theater. When they saw it was this film wild horses couldn't keep them from watching it. They attended the screening and just laughed up a storm through the entire movie especially at the scenes of an old Liberty ship slewing around the ocean like a FletcherClass Destroyer. They were SO loud and boisterous that the rest of the local crowd thought they were Nazi saboteurs and laid hands on them with the intention of beating the crap out of them THEN hanging them. Dudley and my Dad had to produce THEIR merchant seaman's documents and Sailor's Union of the Pacific and Seafarer's International Union cards to the crowd to save their skins. Once the crowd realized WHO they were they were immediately carried to the local saloon and gotten riproaring drunk on the townspeople's dime.I finally got a chance to watch it on TCM sometime back and agree to the potboiler and propaganda elements of the film. That said I DO think the screenplay is a lot better than he gave credit for. Especially considering it was nominated for an Academy Award. The language and characters ring more true than false and I could swear to knowing many old salts just like the crew. My Dad later went on to sail with Jim Thorpe in 194748 and was an able seaman into the early 1960's. But I'll always remember Action In Northern Nebraska as one of his favorite sea stories.So I leave you all with the admonishment and reminder he told me before I went to sea on Destoryers Keep her between the anchors! Just remember son. No matter WHERE you are at sea you're NEVER more than seven miles from land...STRAIGHT DOWN!".

	schema:reviewBody "Raymond Massey and Humphrey Bogart head the cast of this World War II epic detailing the role of the U.S. Merchant Marine a film apparently convincing enough that it was used as a training film for the real military branch of that name. In fact the action sequences are very real and convey a sense of what it must have felt like to be under fire and in peril most of the time the men were at sea.Bogart is Chief Officer Joe Rossi and Raymond Massey is Captain Steve Jarvis first of the ship Northern Star and later aboard the more modern ship the S.S. Seawitch. The Northern Star was blown out of the water by a German submarine the villainous Nazis shown ramming the survivors' life boat and casting them adrift for eleven days before being rescued. Curiously when the men are found aboard a raft the remains of their ship is seen still smoking behind them in the background it seems to me this marker should not have gone unnoticed by search parties for almost two weeks.Bogie and Massey both have love interests back on dry land actually Rossi has a girl in every port as his character is portrayed. Though in a whirlwind romance he manages to meet marry and leave his wife Pearl Julie Bishop for active duty all in what seems like a matter of days. Jarvis on the other hand has had a long marriage to an understanding wife capably played by Ruth Gordon. She has an atypical reaction to his next assignment  To a sailor's wife war is just another storm.On the opposite side of the spectrum Alfred Boats O'Hara Alan Hale finds refuge at sea he's been married a number of times and finds war safer to matrimony  Those Liberty boats are sure well named. He's part of a colorful supporting cast that includes a hot headed Polish seaman named Pulaski Dane Clark and a dedicated cat lover who stows his pets aboard ship each time out. Probably the most curious thing about the film is how the whole rag tag bunch manages to stay together throughout the war. I'm curious as to the accuracy of the scene where the boys all sign up for a hitch together aboard the Seawitch.The second half of the movie offers an interesting cat and mouse game between the German sub and the Seawitch. With Captain Jarvis severely wounded Rossi takes over command and hits upon a clever ruse to defeat the Germans. Setting his ship on fire to make a torpedo hit seem more disastrous than it really was he directs the ship to ram the surfaced UBoat destroying the sub and it's occupants. As the Seawitch makes it's way into the Russian port of Murmansk an American commander comments on their cunning  It's not a miracle it's American seamanship. Not that it's all guts and glory for the Amercicans the tragic side of war is conveyed effectively as well. For an early 1940's film there are a number of battle scenes depicting bodies flying in the air quite realistically amid explosions and torpedo strikes. The poignancy of death is handled discreetly with a burial at sea presided over by Bogie's character. War time audiences must have found some solace in films like this at a time when patriotism was still a respected ideal.".

But on the return trip to Chile in January 1942 the Santa Elisa was attacked just as she left NYC carrying crates of safety matches and barrels of highly explosive carbide crystals. She was then towed back to the Brooklyn Yard for repairs. Which is why Alex was aboard the Colabee.After being refitted the Santa Elisa set out to carry gasoline from England to Malta as part of Churchill's 62 vessel Operation Pedestal. That August 1942 she was attacked a second time and torpedoed by Italian motorboats the gasoline caught fire and she went up in flames off of Tunisia. One account says no survivors official MM record states no deaths.Many parts of the movie show what our Merchant Marine was really going through.

	schema:reviewBody "A cracking formulaic war propaganda piece that brings notice to the often forgotten work that the Allied Merchant Marines did during World War II.

While Ruth Gordon  Julie Bishop play the two filler female roles of the girls left to fret back on dry land.The story follows the crew of the cargo tanker Northern Star who at the start of the film are torpedoed by the Nazis in the North Atlantic. Out on a raft without food and water for eleven days the surviving members of the crew are finally rescued by the Navy. Once recuperated the men wait at home for another ship and finally get assigned to the Sea Witch which is required to take supplies to Murmansk in the Soviet Union. What follows is a perilous journey as the Sea Witch is engaged in battles by a German wolf pack.Brisk in pace Bacon's film contains great 1940s special effects and has a number of excellently constructed action sequences. Successfully blending real life footage and model work with the work on the Warner's lot the makers have managed to craft a piece that shows propaganda movies are not all boorish excuses for flag waving. Yes from the outset we are in no doubt that the German's are dastardly devils the first twenty minutes of the film is both exciting and tense as The Hun try to obliterate our protagonists in a whirl of explosions and burning oil slicks. But at its heart is a very humanistic tale of a group of men from a cross section of ethnic backgrounds trying to keep it together as they do their bit for the war effort. These characters are well formed and thankfully they are acted accordingly by the largely on form cast. Given a thumbs up over the years by veterans of the Merchant Marines the film was also used as a recruitment tool for said service. That in itself is reasons for the movie to hold its head up high. That it's also a ripper of an action movie with very interesting characters doubly makes this a fine entry in the propaganda led genre of 40s war movies. 7.510".

The story of a the crew of a merchant ship crossing the Atlantic during World War 2 the perils they face and how they cope with them.Gritty with a real feel to it. Being made in 1943 it has a degree of propaganda and the inevitable speeches but not to the extent of most other WW2 movies.

	schema:reviewBody "Well this is one movie title that's certainly not misleading. There's tons of action in this gripping WW2 movie about the Merchant Marine. I might even go so far as to say it's got the best and most realistic action sequences from any WW2 movie I've seen. I'm talking about movies made during the era not stuff made decades later with a gazillion dollar budget of course. The story's about an American tanker crew that survives their ship being sunk by a German Uboat and spend eleven days adrift at sea before being rescued. They later return to sea on a Liberty ship leading a convoy. Once again they have to deal with the Nazis. What's not to like? It's a WW2 movie with colorful Warner Bros. character actors Alan Hale Dane Clark Peter Whitney and Sam Levene backing up Humphrey Bogart and Raymond Massey. There's only a couple of minor female roles played well by Julie Bishop and Ruth Gordon. Yeah the plot's pretty basic and the characters may seem clichd but it's all put together so well that I didn't mind. There's something to be said for using a successful formula. The script is great with lots of funny lines and stirring speeches. Good music both score and a nice rendition of Night and Day from a dubbed Julie Bishop. The photography is beautiful. The special effects are exceptional. The direction is terrific especially in those spectacular action scenes. This is all the more remarkable when one considers director Lloyd Bacon didn't get to finish the picture. Bogart is great as always and his fans will love this one. Pretty much anyone who enjoys WW2 movies particularly those from WB will like this a lot. It's an emotional exciting two hours of solid entertainment.".

Bezzerides and a screenplay by John Howard Lawson this slightly above average war drama details the contributions of the Merchant Marines Heroes Without Uniform during World War II. Gilpatric's Original Story was nominated for a Best Writing Oscar.This Warner Bros. propaganda film features several of its stars and goes hand in hand with studio's many other contributions to the war effort providing a stark contrast to the antimilitary propaganda most movie studios have been turning out since Vietnam. Humphrey Bogart Raymond Massey Alan Hale Sam Levene Dane Clark and even Ruth Gordon who plays Massey's wife as she did in their only other film together Abe Lincoln in Illinois 1940 among others appear.Set during World War II Steve Jarvis Massey is the Captain of an oil freighter that's transporting needed fuel to the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. Unfortunately the sea is crawling with German U boats determined to sink the unarmed ship to keep it from helping the Allies. His longtime first mate Lieutenant Joe Rossi Bogart has enough experience to be captain of his own ship but prefers to remain a subordinate closer to the crew with no paperwork responsibilities. Their usual shipmates include Boats O'Hara Hale Chips Abrams Levene Johnnie Pulaski Clark Whitey Lara Peter Whitney and cook Caviar Jinks J. M. Kerrigan uncredited. During this particular voyage they've picked up a studious new youngster Robert Parker Dick Hogan. Soon however their ship is sunk by a German submarine and all hands must abandon ship. Several of the noncredited seaman including Kerrigan Creighton Hale  Glenn Strange die in the burning sea while Jarvis and the rest of his crew man the only lifeboat. But the Uboat surfaces and after some hostile banter between the two captains the German orders his boat to sink the American's lifeboat. Fortunately Jarvis had expelled some rafts from the freighter before it sunk and after 11 days at sea without food or water not really possible? the men are rescued.Jarvis returns to his wife while Rossi meets a bar Irving Bacon appears uncredited as the bartender singer Pearl Julie Bishop whom he marries rather hastily. Parker goes to Merchant Marine school where he becomes a cadet while the rest of the crew gathers at their union's meeting place to wait for another ship to join. The family man Pulaski voices the things that perhaps the others are only thinking about not necessarily wanting to go out again so soon after nearly being killed.However when the opportunity presents itself all sign on again together for another mission and all hard feelings towards Pulaski are forgotten. Jarvis retrieves Rossi and all the men find themselves assigned to the U.S.S. Sea Witch including Cadet Parker and a regimen of other sailors assigned to operate the ship's guns. The Sea Witch is part of a 73 ship convoy assigned the mission to transport much needed supplies including aircraft tanks and more to Murmansk Russia. Charles Trowbridge appears uncredited as the Rear Admiral.Naturally the convoy runs into a wolfpack of German Uboats. Lots of exciting action sequences follow with torpedoes launched most hitting their targets and subs sunk by Destroyers with depth charges. The Sea Witch gets separated from the convoy and must proceed to the destination without escort their only defense are their installed guns and its Navy crew. They battle a German Uboat perhaps even the same one that sunk the oil freighter at the beginning of the film if you can believe the coincidence and dive bombers on their way.It should come as no surprise that the Sea Witch reaches its destination much to the delight of the Russian town and its residents. However Jarvis is injured by strafing fire from one of the dive bombers while Parker is killed by the other when it's shot down and crashes into the Sea Witch's bow. Rossi must then perform a crude surgery to remove the bullet in Jarvis's leg. After having escaped the German Uboat in the fog and by turning off all power such that they were invisible to it the Sea Witch encounters it again before reaching port.The German Uboat commander was smart enough to determine the target destination such that it rendezvoused with Jarvis's boat again. In any case after their ship receives a wounding torpedo Rossi now in charge per Jarvis's injury orders the men to light fires on its deck to fool the Uboat captain into thinking their damage was greater such that he might surface. The commander takes the bait which along with a smoke screen he'd ordered allows Rossi to ram the submarine broadside sinking it.This same strategy was actually copied by director Dick Powell in his film The Enemy Below 1957 though Powell chose to add a bit more having Mitchum the American Captain rescue Jurgens the German.".

	schema:reviewBody "A story about an aspiring young lawyer who tries to break down an insurance company Matt Damon plays Rudy Baylor a Memphis St. Law School graduate who can't seem to find a job anywhere until he meets Bruiser Stone Mickey Rourke. Stone is an ambulance chaser who does whatever it takes legal or not to win a case. Rudy as most law students are when they graduate wants to take the high road do everything by the book and win. What he finds is that sometimes you need to get down and dirty to help your client. In this case his client is a young boy dying of leukemia. Seems the insurance company won't pay for a bone marrow transplant that would save his life. Rudy sets out to help the young man and his family in what turns out to be one of the biggest cases Tennessee has ever seen. Along with his partner Deck Shifflet Danny DeVito Rudy sets out to try and prove to the world that the insurance company is nothing more than a big time scam artist. Along the way Rudy meets and falls in love with a young woman Clare Danes who gets beat up regularly by her husband. This part of the story seemed somewhat strange to me. I couldn't figure out what it was there to do. Was it to give Rudy a love interest? Was it just to give the movie another case so the entire film wasn't centered on the insurance trial? I feel it gave the movie some heart and showed that Rudy would fight for what he believed in both in court and in life. But I think the movie could have been done without it. I enjoyed the trial scenes and all the grunt work that went behind it being a future lawyer myself I hope. And the cast was wonderful. Each person added a little more to the movie and each gave a great performance. Danny Glover as the 2nd judge gave a little humor to the movie but also made you feel good about Rudy's chances in court. He was going to play fair but hew as also going to give Rudy the benefit of the doubt. Jon Voight played the insurance company's lead lawyer and he played his character to it's swarmy best. He is what people think lawyers are like out only for money win at all costs no soul I know attorneys like that. And he was convincing. And of course DeVito and Damon carried the film. I had my doubts about Damon playing a lawyer but the more I watched the more I realized that he looked like people I see at work everyday. He had the same fear in his eyes that we all do but also that dogeatdog determination to prove to the world that he could do the job. The Rainmaker was more about the performances than the story. And the performances won me over. Give it a shot it's worth it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Readers of John Grisham's book will find this film rather less of a thriller and more of a courtroom drama albeit with a curious flat feel to it. The story is that of a legal action on behalf of a teenage boy denied coverage for an expensive bone marrow transplant by his family's medical insurer. Changes to the plotline to accommodate the story to the demands of film drama have removed the unique feature of the book  a largely successful attempt to make the details of legal civil procedure interesting. Francis Coppola is a very innovative yet conventional director you could credit him with authorship of several current movie clichs and his storylines develop according to convention. Thus the love affair which is completely extraneous to the main storyline in the book is pumped up and the fascinating battle of wits between the lawyers played down. As in the book Rudy is the tyro David up against the experienced Goliath Drummond but Rudy's inexperience is played up to the point that you wonder how he got this far. The trial judge who in the book is extremely helpful to Rudy is replaced in the film by a sympathetic but much more impartial figure. In Hollywood conventional courtroom drama His Honor or Her Honor doesn't take sides.That said there is much to enjoy. Danny de Vito playing Deck the paralegal or paralawyer' as Rudy names him who can't seem to pass the bar exam is just brilliant. His Deck is a disheveled unimpressive little guy who is nonetheless good at what he does rainmaking' or finding new business. His strengths are his intelligence his energy and his lack of pride he is quite happy to chase ambulances and give cops backhanders for information. His ethics are simple fight for your client don't steal and try not to lie. While the Deck of the book verges on the grotesque De Vito makes him less of an oddball and hence more sympathetic. Matt Damon as Rudy is wetter behind the ears and not such a quick learner as the Rudy of the book but every so often he connects and we understand how he feels. Mickey Rourke is a bit too elegant as Bruiser Rudy's erstwhile mentor who wears cufflinks on a tropical beach? but it's also an enjoyable performance. Although the script tones down his role John Voight is nastily urbane as superlawyer Drummond.Once again we have a courtroom drama filmed in a grand but gloomy courtroom in fact the lighting people seem to have been absent. We hardly get a glimpse of the face of one important minor character Cliff the wifebeater Andrew Shue yet there is no apparent reason for this. The way some of the scenes were strung together and started and finished were vaguely familiar and half way through it hit me   The Godfather' where scenes just seem to begin and end without any particular reason.One thing the film does almost as well as the book is send the message sorry Mr Goldwyn that America needs to do something about its medical insurance system if the present chaotic mess can be so described. The court system while not perfect comes out of it a bit better David is able to beat Goliath fair and square but as for lawyerswell let's just say things would be a lot better if they stuck to Deck's minimal ethics. The story also might explain why John Grisham who has a walkon role as a lawyer at an al fresco deposition gave up the law to write books thus bringing pleasure to millions instead of hopefully winning retribution for a few.".

	schema:headline " Vastly underappreciated film";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is not a movie that makes you think. It's not arty there are no Corleones there's really no issues to ponder long after the credits have stopped rolling. Instead it's a human drama that uses a courtroom battle as its backbone but the entire body is the honestlytold if ultimately remarkable of a greenhorn lawyer trying to make a life for himself after law school. Like the more recent Garden State the movie is far more interesting than one would initially expect.I recently read the Grisham novel that the screenplay was adapted from and was impressed by the memorable cast of the characters. The corruptandlovingit Prince and Bruiser Deck Shiflett as the skeezy paralawyer who scrapes out a living with an amusing lack of selfconsciousness the bittertempered first judge and his pioneering biased black successor the politely patronizing and puffedup Legal Titan Leo Drummond Cliff and his straightfromDeliverance hillbilly family lonely and slightly bossy Miss Birdie chainsmoking Dot and her addled husband all of them set a standard for memorable but believable characters.Yet the movie is itself a cut or two above the original material. The extended cast does a handsdown fantastic job of bringing each character to life. First billing has to go to Danny Devito for transforming Deck from Rudy's unscrupulous and ugly sidekick in the novel into a more takecharge and casually hilarious partner. Just take a look at the scene where he leads Rudy into the hospital or when he's giving out his card to the kids in Dot's neighborhood. But that's just one of about twenty stellar acting jobs. The extended cast includes Danny Glover Jon Voight Claire Danes Mickey Rourke yes! Virginia Madsen and a handful of other talented but lesserknown actors who show their absolute best through the skillful lens of Coppola.Besides the stellar job by the cast the story is tweaked to absolute perfection. Whether it's the Coppola magic or an excellent adaptation and editing job I see a transformation similar to his triumph with The Godfather an absorbing but complex and sometimes rambling story is condensed into its absolute essence. Not a single shot is out of place.Something else struck me about this adaptation  it reminds me of Peter Jackson's LOTR in the way comic moments are used to balance out the weightiness of the main plot. For example in LOTR Merry and Pippin set off Gandalf's dragon fireworks or in the second movie Gimli can't see over the parapet towards the advancing Urukhai or in the third movie Sam and Gollum have their argument over the proper preparation of rabbits and 'taters and Gandalf instructs Pippin to keep his big mouth shut before they enter the hall of Minas Tirith. Likewise The Rainmaker has its little touches of humor as well from the sardonic lawyer jokes in Rudy's voiceover to the scene where Deck fakehelpfully hands over Drummond's lost shoe after he's been assaulted by an angry juror to Rudy's redfaced apology to the car accident victim in traction whom he has accidentally jostled to Madsen's laconic yet particularly devoted husband Bert. Guess who DIED last night? ...Do you ever sleep? There is anxiety during Kelly's return to her house the suspense of the bug showdown the pathos of Rudy's final speech all these combine with the lighter moments to balance each other like a film version of Pickapeppa sauce.Who could have ever guessed that a Grisham novel could be so perfectly adapted to the screen?! Just try watching the Pelican Brief afterward for comparison. My hat is off to Coppola his cast and everyone else who contributed to this understated masterwork.".

	schema:reviewBody "All cultures have what the sociologist Arnold van Gennep called rites de passage also sometimes called puberty rituals in which the initiate enters the ceremony as a child and emerges as an adult. Coppola and his team show us Rudy Baylor's rite de passage as an attorney. Matt Damon as Rudy is a fresh faced preppylooking kid just out of law school. After working for the sleazebag played by Mickey Rourke and going into partnership with Danny DeVito who has flunked the bar exam six times he can look back down the slope and pick out the idealism he left sprinkled along the route of his ascent. He winds up quitting practice.But it's not a particularly gloomy story. I missed the credits when I first saw this so I had no idea who had created it. I expected a cheap ne plus ultra of mindnumbing commercial fluff. What else would anyone expect with a title like that  John Gresham's 'The Rainmaker'? Shades of Sydney Sheldon! The opening didn't suggest much more than that. There is a voiceover by Matt Damon explaining his background and expectations to us. And we see him being guided openmouthed through the slimier parts of the judicial system. DeVito introduces him for instance to ambulance chasing. Not too promising really because professionals who operate within heavily guarded social borders  like lawyers cops doctors and pilots  almost always assume that the audience is too dumb to know that collusion between a judge and a prominent lawyer takes place. The lay audience is now cynical enough to recognize Perry Mason for the Norman Rockwell fantasy that he is.But it was much better than that. Halfway through I began to think this director whoever he is is pretty deft. I was surprised at an undercurrent of humor. Sometimes it was situational. Two lawyers for instance dashing into a courtroom to try a case neither of whom has a license to practice law. Sworn in by a fool and vouched for by a scoundrel Damon muses. Sometimes the humor requires less attention. In the middle of a dramatic pause DeVito eager to deliver a piece of evidence to his partner stumbles loudly over a waste basket. And there were smaller delicate touches. A splatter of blood spots on a wall as the camera cuts away just before someone is hit over the head. Damon and Claire Danes with whom a love bond is too quickly established in a prison visiting room unable to express their affection because they are lawyer and client except that under the table the tip of his shoe slips forward and brushes the tip of her boot. Wow. Nice touch. And Claire Danes' wifeabusing husband is a stereotype if there ever was one  yet after his murder is discovered and the blinking screaming police cars arrive and she is about to be taken away the wifeabuser's family can be heard in the background shouting DAMN you Kelly. What did you do? You killed my SON? Coppola and the writers have given this moron a previously unheardfrom family of his own and added another surprising dimension to his character.And I couldn't get over the performances. There are several unexpected small parts taken by wellknown actors. And every one of them has a life of its own. Virginia Madsen is being interviewed in a motel room by Damon and she spills the beans on the malignant corporate megagiant that provides the unoriginal heavy. As she speaks she smokes a lot and the camera moves slowly down her arm to show her fingers trembling in her lap. Only later do we learn she has psychiatric problems. Cinematic synecdoche! Roy Scheider is extremely good too a disdainful presence in the witness chair. He's from Orange New Jersey. Why does DeVito so often seem to wind up in movies with other actors from New Jersey? What is it about that state anyway? Does the Jersey Devil have something to do with it? Why does hail always have to be the size of something else? If the universe is expanding what is it expanding INTO? Anyway this for Coppola is a pretty straightforward story neither the grand opera he's attracted to nor the more quiet personal films that usually come in between.I really kind of enjoyed this one. Of the current crop of younger actors Matt Damon seems to me to have the most talent as opposed to say Keanu Reeves. And Claire Danes is so frangible so beatable in this movie even with her leg in a cast and the rest of her limbs and head in bandages she's morbidly alluring and radiates a sort of semisexual heat. Come to think of it  well never mind. See it if you can. It's pretty good.".

Damon and Claire Danes with whom a love bond is too quickly established in a prison visiting room unable to express their affection because they are lawyer and client except that under the table the tip of his shoe slips forward and brushes the tip of her boot. Wow. Nice touch. And Claire Danes' wifeabusing husband is a stereotype if there ever was one  yet after his murder is discovered and the blinking screaming police cars arrive and she is about to be taken away the wifeabuser's family can be heard in the background shouting DAMN you Kelly. What did you do? You killed my SON? Coppola and the writers have given this moron a previously unheardfrom family of his own and added another surprising dimension to his character.And I couldn't get over the performances. There are several unexpected small parts taken by wellknown actors. And every one of them has a life of its own. Virginia Madsen is being interviewed in a motel room by Damon and she spills the beans on the malignant corporate megagiant that provides the unoriginal heavy. As she speaks she smokes a lot and the camera moves slowly down her arm to show her fingers trembling in her lap. Only later do we learn she has psychiatric problems. Cinematic synecdoche! Roy Scheider is extremely good too a disdainful presence in the witness chair. He's from Orange New Jersey. Why does DeVito so often seem to wind up in movies with other actors from New Jersey? What is it about that state anyway? Does the Jersey Devil have something to do with it? Why does hail always have to be the size of something else? If the universe is expanding what is it expanding INTO? Anyway this for Coppola is a pretty straightforward story neither the grand opera he's attracted to nor the more quiet personal films that usually come in between.I really kind of enjoyed this one. Of the current crop of younger actors Matt Damon seems to me to have the most talent as opposed to say Keanu Reeves. And Claire Danes is so frangible so beatable in this movie even with her leg in a cast and the rest of her limbs and head in bandages she's morbidly alluring and radiates a sort of semisexual heat. Come to think of it  well never mind. See it if you can. It's pretty good.";

It's just great storytelling regardless.The film features a deep cast and one that puts on a great displaying acting from the lead good guy Matt Damon to the lead bad guy Jon Voight to all the performers somewhere in the middle headed by ambulance chaser Danny DeVito.It's not a believable story at all  a rookie lawyer fresh out of school outsmarting a team of proved veterans with big money backing them  but it makes for a good story. Everyone likes to root for David against Goliath which is what this turns out to be. Just one example by the way of the political correctness in here the kid lawyer's hopes of a fair trial only become reality after the older obviouslycorrupt white judge suddenly dies and is replaced by Harvard educated black judge Danny Glover of all people. Now as it's quickly demonstrated in the film a man of Liberal sensibilities will be bring fairness and justice to this case!The story is not flattering to lawyers but it's not allcondemning either. It's pretty balanced in that regard. It's just good storytelling and I might add without much profanity. Damon does very well in this choice role and once again demonstrates why he is considered one of the best in the crop of today's younger actors. It helps that he portrays an extremely likable character who not only sticks up for a poor neglected family against a big wealthy corporation but rescues a sweet woman Clarie Danes from her physicallyabusive husband at the same time! Wow he does it all SuperLawyer!Danes is very appealing as the battered wife who winds up being romanced by Damon. That part of the film is not distracting but a nice break from the legalese of the main story. It helps make the movie even more involving. There is very little action in here but not much is needed to keep one's attention since it is so entertaining for the full 2plus hours.".

	schema:reviewBody "Francis Ford Coppola's The Rainmaker is one of the best and most underrated movies of the 90's.  Of course the movie does not have the same effect and emotion of The Godfather or Apocalypse Now but I ask you what does?Spoilers IncludedThe movie stars a preGood Will Hunting Matt Damon as Rudy Baylor an about to graduate law student who meets his future clients at a law workshop at Memphis State University.  Coppola efficiently sets up the meeting of the three clients during a montage very early in the film and the three stories intermingle for the next two hours.  Meanwhile Rudy has accepted a job with a shady cufflinked lawyer who goes by the name Bruiser. Shortly after Rudy passes the bar exam Bruiser's office is overrun by the feds for shady practices that are only explained by Bruiser's appearance and wardrobe.  So Rudy and Deck Shifflet played wonderfully by Danny DeVito start their own law firm with Rudy's three cases.  The first case is a will for an old lady named Ms. Birdie and Rudy actually ends up renting a room in her home.  The next more important case is the divorce of Kelly and Cliff Riker.  Cliff is a guy who uses his aluminum bat for more than just softball and Rudy instantly feels a connection to Kelly and wants to help her get rid of Cliff.Finally the story of the movie revolves around the case of Dot Black v. Great Benefit Insurance.  Mrs. Black's son is dying of leukemia and they are unable to afford a bone marrow transplant for him because Great Benefit has denied their claim.  Rudy has obtained this case only because the Black's can't afford a lawyer either and went to a law workshop as I mentioned earlier.The case sets up with the rookie lawyer going against the big bad insurance company and their million dollar lawyers but the movie never really harps on that point.  The story is really about Rudy.  Throughout the film he develops a relationship with Kelly gets sworn in as a lawyer tries his first case watches Donny Ray Black wither away and in the end he prevails everywhere.The reason this movie works starts with the screenplay.  The people in this movie act and talk LIKE REAL PEOPLE.  The performances are solid all the way around with actors such as Danny Glover Mary Kay Place Roy Scheider and Mickey Rourke all playing smaller supporting roles.  In addition Coppola made the excellent choice to let the story tell itself.  I recently watched Runaway Jury another Grisham based movie and that movie failed because it so desperately tried to make a political statement that it just got silly.  In The Rainmaker the big insurance company is just as evil as the gun company in Runaway Jury but here it works becuase the facts that just play out and we don't need the actors to tell us who the bad guys are.Finally the character of Rudy is a very interesting one because he is not the typical good guy lawyer trying to do the right thing.  He gets involved with each of his clients in ways that a lawyer never should.  He engages in jury tampering phone bugging and even gets involved in a murder.Overall this is the best of the Grishamadapted movies and one of the best films of the 1990's.".

Cliff is a guy who uses his aluminum bat for more than just softball and Rudy instantly feels a connection to Kelly and wants to help her get rid of Cliff.Finally the story of the movie revolves around the case of Dot Black v. Great Benefit Insurance.  Mrs. Black's son is dying of leukemia and they are unable to afford a bone marrow transplant for him because Great Benefit has denied their claim.  Rudy has obtained this case only because the Black's can't afford a lawyer either and went to a law workshop as I mentioned earlier.The case sets up with the rookie lawyer going against the big bad insurance company and their million dollar lawyers but the movie never really harps on that point.  The story is really about Rudy.  Throughout the film he develops a relationship with Kelly gets sworn in as a lawyer tries his first case watches Donny Ray Black wither away and in the end he prevails everywhere.The reason this movie works starts with the screenplay.  The people in this movie act and talk LIKE REAL PEOPLE.  The performances are solid all the way around with actors such as Danny Glover Mary Kay Place Roy Scheider and Mickey Rourke all playing smaller supporting roles.  In addition Coppola made the excellent choice to let the story tell itself.  I recently watched Runaway Jury another Grisham based movie and that movie failed because it so desperately tried to make a political statement that it just got silly.  In The Rainmaker the big insurance company is just as evil as the gun company in Runaway Jury but here it works becuase the facts that just play out and we don't need the actors to tell us who the bad guys are.Finally the character of Rudy is a very interesting one because he is not the typical good guy lawyer trying to do the right thing.  He gets involved with each of his clients in ways that a lawyer never should.  He engages in jury tampering phone bugging and even gets involved in a murder.Overall this is the best of the Grishamadapted movies and one of the best films of the 1990's.";

The story isn't as interesting in this movie but the cast is great the entertainment value is excellent and veteran Director Francis Ford Coppola is behind the camera here. Coppola has directed movies like the epic mob masterpiece The Godfather and plenty of other great movies.This was released a couple of weeks before Matt Damon's huge hit Good Will Hunting so this is one of his first big roles in a movie. Danny De Vito does a great job in adding plenty of humor to the movie and Jon Voight adds a lot of dramatic effect to his character.The story follows a young lawyer who is representing the family of a boy with leukemia who could have had proper treatment but couldn't because of a seedy insurance company. The movie pretty much follows the book but the problem is that the book had a few great sub plots that seem absent from the movie and one scene that happens in the middle of the movie happens in the end of the book. The scene is very intense but it seems more like it belonged at the end of the movie rather than the middle.This is worth watching it is one of the best Grisham films and there are plenty of great qualities in it.".

	schema:headline " Coppola is still a good director.";
	schema:reviewBody "After making his master pieces The godfather I and II and Apocalypse now between 1972 and 1979 Francis Ford Coppola never had the same success with other movie. He directed near a dozen of films in the 80's and 90's and probably the most acclaimed were The cotton club 1984 'The godfather III 1990 and his adaptation of Bram Stroker's novel Dracula 1992. In 1997 he repeated a formula well known by him adapt a novel to the big screen. He chose a story about a young lawyer Rudy Baylor fairly interpreted by Matt Damon and his first experiences in the law world. There are four topics I would like to talk about this film The rainmaker 1997. 1 Direction by Coppola. As a filmmaker he proved that he is still capable of telling stories combining humor drama and deep emotions. Coppola is very skillful developing his characters and has the ability to select a good cast to work with. Besides Damon who is OK in his role the director selected professional and experienced actors to support secondary roles. Mickey Rourke as the folkloric Bruiser Stone John Voight as the big firm partner Leo Drummond Dany Glover as the sympathetic judge Danny Devito excellent performance as the almostlawyer Deck Shifflett and even in minor roles was supported by good actors like Roy Scheider Great Benefit CEO Dean Stockwell as the corrupt and hard smoker judge Hale and Virginia Madsen Jackie Lemanczyk. Other good thing about the director is his ability to move the characters to the exact point where they deliver a solid and convincing acting performance including young actors in main roles like Damon Clare Danes as the beaten wife and Johny Withworth as the young character dying of leukemia. As I mentioned in the title Coppola is still a good director. 2 The criticism against two major American institutions lawyers and insurance companies. As always the poor and low income population is the affected. During the movie we can see what reality is along the land of opportunities big institutions and firms don't care about the individuals but for money. Individuals are only the means to get income nothing more. There are interesting procedures used by the insurance institutions to get the majority of the income with the minimal expense related with claims and reimbursements. In the other hand lawyers are radicalized since the young and idealistic attorney through the experienced and money oriented firm partner. Every lawyer in the movie represents a kind of attorney and the different believes. 3 Stories developed. During the film we follow at least four different subplots the young wife beaten by her husband the great trial against the insurance company the tragic tale about a young man dying of leukemia and the old lady and her will. Rudy Baylor is personally involved in the different stories and we are moving from drama to romance from tragedy to humor. Good combination and balance. 4 Finally I would like to comment about Danny De Vito's role. With no doubt is the best developed character of all. He is the responsible of most of the humoristic scenes but at the same time is the key element. He has a lot of connections experience and nonsensibility manners to get what he wanted. De Vito developed his role with energy and comedy. He is the one that stole the movie for him self. Hope that Coppola has the opportunity to direct a few more movies like this. If well The Rainmaker is not his best film by far the picture is a good example of what he is still capable to do. I recommend this picture to see it discuss it and have a good time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most good courtroom dramas and legal movies deal with murder. Those are just simply the most fun ones to see. The ones that do not deal with murder have to be extra great for everybody to like it. This is one that is simply that good without the need of murder. This is based on the 1995 novel by John Grisham of the same name. I'll have to admit I did not like the novel. It was too boring with too many subplots and just dragged on about nothing. What Grisham bored me with Coppola condenses in a way that I wish Grisham wrote in the first place. This features a starstudded cast Matt Damon Claire Daines Danny DeVito Jon Voigt Danny Glover Teresa Wright Mickey Rourke Roy Scheider that is bound to make this movie that much more enjoyable. The movie is about recent lawschool grad Rudy Baylor Damon who is assigned to a case involving a poor family suing a wealthy insurance company for not paying for their son's cancer treatments. The company hires a highpower law firm with years of experience with very little losses. Rudy has never even been involved in a case before. At first the lawyers make him look bad. Then Rudy slowly turns the tables on them as he shows what the company has really been up to. That is what makes the courtroom portion so interesting. A youth fresh of of school successfully files a lawsuit in such an exciting and believable way. But it is not realistic how he is assigned a highprofile case right off the bat. In reality Rudy would have to work for years near the bottom of a firm and slowly get to the position he is at in the film. This is not as good as most of Coppola's other movies and not 1997's best. The acting and everything might be good but a big chunk of the movie is so gloomy and dull. But it is better than the book. Luckily it is one of those that gets better as the minutes go. Bit by bit the case gets more complex and Rudy tries to save the life of a woman Daines who's in a stormy relationship with her husband all which make the movie a very fine watch.".

The insurance company and their hired legal guns headed by Jon Voight. As you watch Damon in court you see the faint shadow and hear the faint echo of Gary Cooper or James Stewart. But even those guys had some help from the Danny DeVitos back then. Good to have at least one savvy rogue on your side.The Rainmaker is good courtroom drama and there isn't a player going that doesn't want one of those.

I'm up for a good legal drama so I seek to watch it without actually knowing who's the director or the rest of the cast.Anyway after 2 hours and 15 minutes this movie disappoints.It's unnecessary long for a rather simple story that it could fit nicely in a 45' minutes episode of a TV show and it has no real thrills or interesting scenes. The material that you could build upon it is there but the movie fails miserably to deliver.The drama is obvious but it doesn't build to a climax. The actual case as it presented in the courthouse it's boring too and despite the effort of Damon to present himself as the rookie lawyer and Jon Voight's performance you never get that sense of Davis vs. Goliath that this movie is all about.Sooo many good legal dramas and interesting and fun movies were shot in the 80s and in the 90s but The Rainmaker is most certainly not one of them.".

The Rainmaker is a very good story about a newly qualified lawyer who takes on a multibillion insurance company for the family of a young man dying of leukaemia. Exciting stuff with a pleasing if slightly simplified end but a entertaining lawprocedural plot. Enter the amazing acting talent of Matt Damon. He was excellent in this film measured quietly strong and believable up against the arrogance of his opposite number Jon Voight for the Insurance Company. Also Danny DeVito was good and he and Damon seemed to work well together. Some of the make up special effects were a little poor. Aside from the main characters some of the acting wasn't deep or developed enough but were generally good but the actual production of the film was lacking something. The sound quality was bad there seems to be pauses in the action and some continuity and pacing issues. The film feels amateurish and low budget. Coppola who directed clearly wanted a grim and grey feel to the film which I think he achieved but it didn't make it look that good. However it is Damon and DeVito and the story that carries this film and that is what you are invested in with a John Grisham film. Definitely highly entertaining.".

Admittedly Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel is lowbudget but it doesn't look completely slipshod. The story is original and well structured when the film started though I was like oh dear but as the film got going it got better while the writing was funny smart and tongueincheek. The direction is competent the music is good and the pacing I had little problem with either. The acting is spirited especially with Chris O'Dowd and Marc Wooton who both show a lot of spontaneous boyish charm that make their characters appealing. I agree in some ways the characters border on stereotypical but the acting and writing is enough to not make it matter that much. Anna Farris starts off a little stiff but once she gets into the film and her role she gets better. Even the title was funny and amusing.Overall I liked it. It is not the best movie I have ever seen but it was funny and smart and it was refreshing to see something that was actually funny.Friedberg and Seltzer take notes 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " A smart and very funny take on the sciencefiction genre.";
	schema:reviewBody "Ray Chris O'Dowd Toby Marc Wootton and Pete Dean Lennox Kelly are out in the pub for the night going through their usual rounds of beer crisps and complaints about general things including movies music and their deadend lives in general. Well they think they're facing a brick wall but really things are about to get a little scifior science fiction if you're picky about that sort of thing. You see when one of the guys goes into the toilet he discovers that there's a timeleak somewhere within that causes them to leap back and forth along a timeline that risks all of them destroying the entire universe as they know it. Sound really nerdy? Well it is. Except it's not pedantic nerdy but actually smart witty and engagingly imaginer don't ask. The resulting movie is one that excels in both situation and character comedy whilst also telling a really good story to bootwhile there are flaws in the entire design most of which occur in the later stages as things get more and more complicated Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel is a short but sweet take on the sciencefiction comedy that knows how to strike up a laugh or two but not at the expense of story or character.Even though just about one of the three central actors has had major exposure on British TV and more recently cinema the performances are pitchperfect. Striking a firm balance between realism and expertly timed gags Dowd Wootton and Kelly provide the movie with enough charm and boy humour to prevent the movie from sinking in a pile of convoluted unfunny esoteric nonsense. Rather the lighthearted presence of the three allows the feature to breathe with a sense of personality while the film deals largely with two eccentric nerds and one slightly less nerdy partner in crime these guys aren't your typical silver screen cutout stereotypes usually afforded to such personas. Instead director Gareth Carrivick strives to maintain a sense of realism about his movie which permeates throughout.Rather surprisingly this manifests itself not just in the characters but in the hammy scifi plot itself which involves the three jumping around time and avoiding bumping into themselvesthus avoiding deadly paradoxes.

	onyx:emotionText "Ray Chris O'Dowd Toby Marc Wootton and Pete Dean Lennox Kelly are out in the pub for the night going through their usual rounds of beer crisps and complaints about general things including movies music and their deadend lives in general. Well they think they're facing a brick wall but really things are about to get a little scifior science fiction if you're picky about that sort of thing. You see when one of the guys goes into the toilet he discovers that there's a timeleak somewhere within that causes them to leap back and forth along a timeline that risks all of them destroying the entire universe as they know it. Sound really nerdy? Well it is. Except it's not pedantic nerdy but actually smart witty and engagingly imaginer don't ask. The resulting movie is one that excels in both situation and character comedy whilst also telling a really good story to bootwhile there are flaws in the entire design most of which occur in the later stages as things get more and more complicated Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel is a short but sweet take on the sciencefiction comedy that knows how to strike up a laugh or two but not at the expense of story or character.Even though just about one of the three central actors has had major exposure on British TV and more recently cinema the performances are pitchperfect. Striking a firm balance between realism and expertly timed gags Dowd Wootton and Kelly provide the movie with enough charm and boy humour to prevent the movie from sinking in a pile of convoluted unfunny esoteric nonsense. Rather the lighthearted presence of the three allows the feature to breathe with a sense of personality while the film deals largely with two eccentric nerds and one slightly less nerdy partner in crime these guys aren't your typical silver screen cutout stereotypes usually afforded to such personas. Instead director Gareth Carrivick strives to maintain a sense of realism about his movie which permeates throughout.Rather surprisingly this manifests itself not just in the characters but in the hammy scifi plot itself which involves the three jumping around time and avoiding bumping into themselvesthus avoiding deadly paradoxes.

A lot of people have been saying that Anna Faris is uncomfortable in this but I didn't feel that at all I expect she enjoyed doing something completely different to what she's used to. Meredith MacNeill too has be described as awkward and such but she's playing a character who's completely barmy and I think she expressed that well. Yes the special effects are not the best but they're not terrible. For a scifi sorry Speculative Fiction! film there aren't many of them and rather there's more focus on dialogue and antics between the cast but I think that works the effects are not overly distracting and the postnuclear city I though actually looked really good. I've given this 710 because some things could have been tidied up and the script is not perfect. Also there are mistakes and perhaps a slightly larger budget wouldn't have hurt.

The plot was really good too. It all seemed to flow well and they didn't seem to be any major plot holes. It could get a little confusing to some people though. Like Pete still ran into the bathroom after he heard the glass knock over onto the paper so how come he travelled through time still when he ran back in? Well I suppose he went back to present time which makes sense.Anyway I thought this film was brilliant although short and I would recommend it anybody.".

No one knew what the Hell it was about or who was in it. This is a real shame because the movie deserves far more recognition than it has received. For example this is probably only the fifteenth review of the movie written in December for a movie released in April the same year. Go figure.In any event if you liked SotD you should like this.

A nicely written script with likable characters and not too many clichs to me and I'll probably get slagged off for this even better than 'Shaun of the Dead' shock!.I read that the director Gareth Carrivick sadly died earlier this year from Leukaemia.

Gladiator and Titanic might be flawless  or close to that  on some technical points of view but I'd never characterise such movies as being humane. FAQATT isn't perfect but it's perfectly humane and has a heart hence the 10.O'Dowd cracks me up just for being himself. I don't recall seeing his two friends the character's that is in any other movie but they were anything but unlikeable. I liked Faris on House Bunny so I may be a bit biased when it comes to her filmography.First I thought I shouldn't mention the fact that it's a lowbudget movie since I believe that's one thing lowbudget movies don't want to bring the focus to the budget. But then again the writer did so right in the beginning of the movie so I think it's OK not really a spoiler if it happens in the first couple of minutes isn't it?.Anyways if you're in doubt about watching this movie I recommend you do. I did not vote 1010 as a joke. I plan to buy this movie whenever I can just to show the people involved my appreciation. I believe the director is not longer with us so I hope someday I get to thank him in person or in any other form for this great movie.Kudos to everyone involved. As long as there are lowbudget movies like this I can walk through big multiplex theaters knowing that the end is not near.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a great little movie if you're a fan of the BritPub genre. It's a funny film with half a dozen laughoutloud moments  which is more than I get from most comedies these days. It's clearly inspired by Shaun of the Dead  but also too by the Narnia Secret Garden etc doorwaytoanotherworld concept  albeit with a convincingly gross gents toilet in place of the wardrobe.For me it has the edge over Shaun of the Dead. This could be simply because I prefer the scifi parody over a horror parody. Or it could be that in this movie the characters are allowed to be aware that their real world still exists and hence their banal behaviour seems more appropriate. Shaun failed for me because it's set in a fundamentally unbelievable world  I can only take so much absurdity. For example I loved the way when after several time trips the three friends are back waiting for their other selves to leave the pub on an earlier time trip  but Ray thinks he has time to nip to the bar for a round of drinks while they're waiting. Priceless.Since watching the film I've read some criticisms of Anna Faris  for example a bewildered cameo. I saw that as appropriate characterisation first time around and the same on a second viewing. From the moment we meet her it seems pretty clear she should not be in charge of a time travel device and it's this that makes Ray's touching faith in her expertise so amusing.I think the movie will grow in popularity and the current level of criticism eg. rottentomatoes 37 will look a little foolish. An example  criticising a character who confuses Star Wars and Star Trek as an old gag  when it's clearly done consciously  Pete is trying to kid his two friends and it's been done as a knowing nod to the old gag. And complaining that it's appropriate only for TV  an extended Red Dwarf episode  seems odd in light of the fact that it was made by the BBC and we're all going to watch it on TV. I suspect a good many reviewers are forgetting that a comedy set in a pub has defined the limits of it's ambition quite clearly and we might bear that in mind".

Lo and behold in short order things start getting awkward as a time traveller named Cassie played by Anna Faris appears and then an actual time travel hole is found in none other than the pisser from which comedy and paradox ensues.Any fresh perspective on time travel here? Not really. But from there you get O'Dowd's lovable nerdiness and fascination as Ray along with his cute romance with Cassie as his friends much more begrudgingly try to hold on to their senses and figure the whole conundrum out. Best is Pete the cynic nonbeliever who as some sort of cosmic joke ends up getting the worst of the travelling and becomes a paranoid survivalist. Allusions to other time travel movies are everywhere including probably my favorite a moment when the three discover that they are going to be important and famous historical figures and trying to figure out what they will do to deserve it one says Maybe we start a band... and then the three of them think about it and decide that's ridiculous.What really goes for this movie in the long run is O'Dowd's character's utter wideeyed excitement and dedication to experiencing this thing that he's dreamed so much about and how it ultimately drives along all of the characters as they tag along for the ride. It's a fantasy fulfillment movie for the nerd in all of us who just wants to see what the future's like giant murderous ants or no and O'Dowd is particularly good for the role because he is sort of like the Michael Cera form of humor where the actor probably has more familiarity with the character than just acting and is relatable on that level. His role here in the IT Crowd and in The Boat that Rocked are all essentially the same but that character is the always relatable underdog who whether selfconscious or no loves what he loves and wants to share it with other people.However I do not believe Imagineers is going to stick.PolarisDiB".

We don't really need to know the science behind it because simply put science can neither logically explain its paradoxical nature nor prove or dispute its possibility. The Time Traveler's Wife never makes pretenses to the science behind it rather it centers its focus on the story.At the heart of this film is a love story and the complexities that people bring to their relationships. What I liked most was its metaphorical allusion to the distance in relationships and how the important people in our lives stay with us even after they are gone. The scenes between Henry and young Clare were especially moving because they took literally the notion of feeling like you have known someone your whole life. It's kind of like when you share stories from your past with friends and significant others retelling them time and again until your experiences are indistinguishable from theirs except in the case of Henry and Clare the experiences are real if not linear.Just go and watch it. Decide for yourself if you like it. Just don't dwell too much on the technicalities.

	schema:reviewBody "8 times and counting. That's how many times I've read the book. The episodic structure of the novel is such that it's easy to dip in and out of even if you're reading other things. You can quite easily spend an hour or a day with Henry and Claire whenever you wish.When I found out that they were making a movie of the book my initial reaction was how? There's far too much to cram into a two hour movie. Surely they'd be better making a mini series?The fact is that they leave a lot of things out of the movie. Characters who you'd assume would be quite important are given very little screen time or excised completely. Also the ending of the novel isn't used only the spirit of the ending. The book's ending was filmed however so maybe it'll turn up as a DVD extra for all the purists out there.You know what though? The movie is great. It's perfectly cast and instead of concentrating on every minute detail that made the book a joy to read it concentrates solely on the boy meetsgirloutoftime concept and plays out a love story over an eveningsized slice of time. Lots of people have complained that their favourite part from the book isn't in it Rachel's disastrous first date with another man and Henry's revenge for it The Gomez situation Ingrid Christmas at Meadowlark etc but really there is enough in this movie to sustain it and to give any newcomers to the story a decent enough reason to run off and read the book to fill in the blanks. Those people especially are in for a treat as while the movie does have it's moments of high drama there is a noticeable lack of darkness which the book has in spades. Also kudos must go to Bruce Joel Rubin for the writing of a brand new scene featuring a time travelling Henry and his mother on a subway train which slotted in perfectly to the TTW world.Rachel McAdams makes a stunning Claire her scenes revolving around the pregnancy issues they have are completely believable and heartfelt. Early reports suggested Eric Bana wasn't up to snuff in his performance of Henry. I can only assume those reviewers had been watching a very rough cut as I thought he was fantastic. Special mention also to Arliss Howard as Henry's dad and Stephen Tobolowsky as Kendrick who both go to demonstrate how scenes can be stolen with very limited screen time.For everyone who's going in expecting the book lower your expectations. It isn't the book. What it is is a condensed version of the main love story from the book played out perfectly with respect for the text. I enjoyed the movie immensely and am looking forward to seeing it again. If I want the book I'll read the book. My imagination is perfectly capable of providing me with the visuals I need. However from now on if I want to spend the evening with the DeTambles and let someone else do the work I'll be watching the movie.".

	schema:headline " Terrific performances and chemistry from Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana keep the movie afloat";
	schema:reviewBody "The Time Traveler's Wife is a romantic drama directed by Robert Schwentke adapted from Audrey Niffenegger's bestseller of the same name. Adapting a novel with complex elements and undertones to the silver screen is a daunting task and director Robert Schwentke struggled to compromise between satisfying readers of the novel and making the movie accessible to people unfamiliar with the book. Overall the movie has some significant directing and screen writing flaws but does make for an unpretentious and aboveaverage romantic tragedy thanks to its two compelling leads.Sypnosis The Time Traveler's Wife is the timedefying love story of Henry DeTamble Eric Bana and Clare Abshire Rachel McAdams. Henry is a librarian afflicted with a genetic disease that causes him to travel through time more or less randomly. Henry's random and unpredictable escapades are often dangerous terrifying and sometimes lifethreatening ordeals because he ends up bucknaked and starving in unknown places and times. For those reasons Henry keeps himself in top physical shape and taught himself all type of survival skills such as pickpocketing street fighting or picking locks. After a random while he always goes back to his present but is largely unable to affect his future. At age 28 he meets 20yr old Clare Abshire. He doesn't know her but she has known him since she was 6 and has been waiting for him all her life and will do so the rest of her life...The main weaknesses of the movie can be traced back to trying to fit the book into 107 minutes. Director Robert Schwentke and screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin appeared a bit overmatched and took the path of least resistance oversimplifying the plot and characters. The book was a bit confusing at times because of its particular narrative structure and the movie inherits the same problem. Screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin made some compromises to keep the movie from becoming excessively long or inaccessible to its PG13 audience. The main events and characters of the book were translated to the big screen although nonessential characters such as Kimi or Ingrid were completely omitted and the ending was slightly altered and I liked it. The supporting characters are a mere passing thoughts the key relationship between Clare and Gomez is onedimensional. Even the two main characters Henry and Clare are underdeveloped. Ideally the direction of the movie should have been given to a director with better credentials and the movie extended up to 140 minutes to develop the characters fully and take advantage of the terrific cast.Despite those shortcomings The Time Traveler's Wife is one of those movies you can't help but like. It is at heart a simple starcrossed love story with a refreshing scifi twist that touches on universal themes such as fatefree will true love and loss. A story that focused on the depth of the characters' love not its showiness. Their will to move forward and enjoy every minute they have with each other before Henry's impending fate. This meant more closeup shots and a deeper and more realistic exploration of what it means to be Henry and Clare. The movie succeeds in moving the audience thanks in big part to moving performances from the two leads who surrendered themselves fully to the premise of the novel.The Time Traveler's Wife features the graceful Rachel McAdams as the title character. Most will have missed her terrific performance in the 2008 indie the Lucky Ones and this puts her back on the radar for mainstream audiences. Beside matching the description of Clare in the book McAdams has an unusual ability to make her characters feel real against all odds. Overcoming an underwritten character she carries the emotional weight of the movie and was luminous portraying Clare's spirit and unyielding love for Henry's despite being riddled with some terrible lines once again. Will someone give Rachel McAdams a meatier role for God's sake??? Eric Bana was a big surprise exceeding my expectations and making for a very solid Henry. Although he does not fit the physical description of the book Henry is more runner than football player Bana's Henry was tormented introverted poignant and more importantly had considerable chemistry with his costar. The only issue I had was that Henry was mostly a onenote character. The supporting cast was solid albeit given very little opportunity to be memorable. Gomez Ron Livingstone was a pivotal character in the book but merely a passing thought in the movie. Jane McLean as Charisse Arliss Howard as Henry's father Stephen Tobolowsky as Dr. Kendrick all did a fine job with the small parts they had.The cinematography has a beautiful stark and cold quality to it which reinforce the tragic nature of the movie. The movie was beautifully shot by Florian Ballhaus and is the strongest attribute of the movie behind its leads. The crafty camerawork using motion and placement selection gave a particular tone to his scenes and Schwentke used that to his advantage in the film giving the movie a light touch of fantasy. He created a nice immersing atmosphere that really highlighted Clare and Henry's impending fate. The CGI effects of Henry's time traveling are unspectacular but first rate while the overused musical score was melancholic adding to the tragic tone of the movie.Enjoy the Time Traveler's Wife for what it is an endearing love story with an unusual scifi premise. It may not be exactly like the book it may have been darker and heavier on the scifi and it may have been so much more with better direction. Even so the premise of the story and the perfectlycast leads make this movie wellworth the ride and will keep your imagination lingering long afterward.B Boasting terrific performances and chemistry from Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana the Time Traveler's Wife has some flaws but is a charming endearing and bittersweet romantic drama nonetheless.httpanomalousmaterial.blogspot.com".

McAdams and Bana are both beautiful and amazing in Director Robert Schwentke's The Time Traveler's Wife based on the bestselling novel by Audrey Niffenegger. The Time Traveler's Wife adapted by screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin is a bitter sweet and strange love story. It is not perfect although it ends perfectly. There is a timeless and yearning quality that engages in The Time Traveler's Wife. However Schwentke and Rubin might have leveraged sharper emotional arcs at particular narrative points. During the course of their lives Clare and Henry experience tragedy and joy. In spite of this Rachel McAdams is stunning. I am in love with her. Bana is powerful and moving.In a heartbreaking scene Clare McAdams tells Henry Bana Do you think I wanted this life? Time Traveler Henry indiscriminately vanishes to different places in time and space. Interesting to that end this seems to follow The Terminator rule Henry can only travel through time naked. Also interesting to note that Bana as Henry is a muscular 6'3 which makes finding clothes that fit wherever he arrives difficult. I digress. The point is McAdams captures both Clare's humanity and angst. She embodies an authenticity in Clare. Eric Bana displays a strength and gentleness. His Henry travels to the future and meets his lovely 10 year old daughter Alba amazing Hailey McCann. He gazes upon Alba with such love when she says I love you Daddy! Underlying it all The Time Traveler's Wife is about legacy and everlasting love. So regardless of some clumsy repetitive narrative loops and circular logic McAdams and Bana make you care about their love story.We first see 6 year old Henry good Alex Ferris singing with his mom Annette beautiful and strong Michelle Nolden in a car. Tragedy befalls and Henry's Time Traveler abilities are revealedalso by the grown up Henry Bana. But for Henry this seems more curse than gift. Then one day Clare sees Henry in a Chicago library and says It's you! Apparently older Henry has been visiting Clare since she was 6 years old. She says that he seems to keep visiting the same places. Henry replies Yeah. It's like gravity. Clare has been in love with Henry her entire life.It turns out that Henry has a genetic defect that is the cause of his time travel. To that end he seeks out and finally convinces the bewildered Dr. Kendrick solid Stephen Tobolowsky of his plight. But what does this foreshadow about Clare and Henry having a family and their life together? Director Schwentke sort of telegraphs the painful narrative twist. Then he recovers and resolves perfectly and eloquently as Henry regrets I can't stay Ultimately The Time Traveler's Wife is about lifeits joy fragility and mortality. Things just happen not necessarily for a reason. And if you take a chance and find the love of your life then it is life worth having lived. I loved The Time Traveler's Life.".

Talk about popping in unannounced! Maybe you think it's stupid that this lady planned a large wedding in front of tons of people knowing full well that her beloved Eric Bana could disappear at any moment leaving her with the catering bill that as you can imagine came to quite a hefty fee. But as for myself I find it appealing and devilmaycare.

	schema:headline " What Benjamin Button Wanted To Be";
	schema:reviewBody "The Time Traveler's Wife PG13 146  SF 2nd string original OSIT romanticsThis is the movie that Benjamin Button aspired to be. It's the tale of an unusual man a man who does not experience time the way everybody else does and of the woman who loves him anyway. Unlike Button their sheer humanity and love of life make us actually care. Clearly SF The Time Traveler's Wife has none of the superficiality of character all too common to the genre indeed it's as sincere and genuine a love story as you'll ever find in the movies.The time traveler is not the unnamed Edwardian Era protagonist of H. G. Wells's The Time Machine. In fact this one has a name  Henry DeTamble  and he lives in some vaguely contemporary time period. As the movie opens we seem him at age 6 happily singing Jingle Bells while riding in a car driven by his mother thru a driving rainstorm. Their car gets clipped Henry gets banged up a bit and the shock triggers his 1st time jump. Mere seconds later he returns to the side of the road and watches horrified as his mother frantically twisting around to search the back seat for her suddenly missing son fails to see the big truck bearing down on her. And moments after that his future self Eric Bana arrives to assure him that things will get better.It is left to the viewer to imagine how Henry must have felt about his own role in his mother's death. We learn that he doesn't have much control over when he will dematerialize except that it often seems to be triggered by stress or excitement so we can imagine the effect this would have on his love life. And he's sometimes gone for weeks at a time with no believable excuse so this gives us a clue about his job security.Thus it's no surprise that he's a bit of a mess when working his Chicago job as a research librarian he's approached by Clare Abshire a woman he's never seen before who professes that she's been in love with him for decades  and that it's been mutual. How messed up is he? Well he's standing there with Rachel McAdams  OMG! Rachel McAdams!!  aiming that beautiful smile and those big eyes right at him and he's trying to find excuses to back away. Fortunately for him and the story she manages to overcome his hesitation.We learn a very few things about time traveling. Henry can travel to times outside of his own lifetime but most often he shows up at times and places that occur on his own personal lifeline thru the 4dimensional spacetime monobloc. It's only his body that makes the trip which means that usually his 1st task on arrival is finding clothes. There's apparently a genetic not mechanical or quantum basis for his ability or affliction and this leads him to seek aid from Dr. David Kendrick. In a moment reminiscent of transparent aluminum Henry informs Dr. Kendrick that future scientists will know him as the inventor of the phrase chrono displacement the few other paradoxes are equally subtle.But the movie isn't so much about time travel as it is about Henry and Clare's profound and enduring love for each other under trying circumstances. Not since Christopher Reeve pined away forlornly for Jane Seymour in Somewhere in Time 1980 haunting theme by John Barry has this theme been done so well in SF.Henry Clare and their starcrossed relationship take up most of the screen time. But like a diamond set off by smaller jewels McAdams and Bana are surrounded by exquisite little gems from the supporting performers notably Brooklynn Proulx as young Clare and the McCann sisters Hailey and Tatum as their dotter Alba at ages 10 and 5.No film is perfect and this one isn't either but I have to single out one niggling detail that kept distracting me thruout this movie and most other ones that Eric Bana has appeared in. It's this Somebody should introduce the guy to either a razor or the concept of a beard. I don't care how devoted Rachel McAdams is to you if you look like you're always coming off a perpetual hangover it's gonna wear off.".

	schema:reviewBody "While the concept of 'The Time Traveler's Wife' appears pretty clever the actual execution proves quite inept. Eric Bana is Henry DeTamble a Chicago librarian who has some kind of genetic mutation which causes him to skip around in time. The twist is that every time he jumps in time he loses his clothes. You might think that the image of the naked Henry scrambling around for new duds as he appears in different eras might have the potential for some neat comic possibilitiesbut humorless director Robert Schwentke opts for a completely heavyhanded serious approach.The way the time traveling works is that Henry is apparently drawn back to the significant events of his life. Chief among them is a car accident in which 6 year old Henry survives but his mother is killed. Henry still gets the opportunity to see his mother prior to her death as he time jumps into a preaccident encounter on a train. Later he visits his father who is now an alcoholic as he never got over his wife's death. The father knows about Henry's time traveling and berates him for not being able to prevent his mother's death. Henry states that he's been to the scene of the accident numerous times and despite his efforts is never able to alter the events of what occurs it's interesting that there are no scenes in which Henry does try and prevent his mother from being killed. Nonetheless despite claiming that he's unable to change history midway through the story Henry jumps into the future where he buys a lottery ticket providing a five million dollar windfall for he and his wife and guaranteeing the family's financial security for the rest of their lives.One of the givens in this movie is to accept the absurd premise of a genetic mutation that can cause time travel. Since the story is a fantasy it's a perfectly acceptable conceit. But even within the fantasy concept there has to be some kind of internal logic. It's posited that Henry has no control over his timetraveling forays. He supposedly never knows when he'll be leaving or returning to a particular place and point in time. What's more it's not one Henry who is travelingthere appear to be numerous incarnations of Henry at different points in his life who pop up all over the place. So how is it that these different Henry's conveniently know when to pop back up a critical dramatic moment despite the fact that they supposedly have no control over their time hopping abilities? I'm thinking particularly about the wedding scene where the younger Henry disappears right before he's supposed to get hitched and then is replaced by the older grayhaired Henry at the altar.In reading various postings on the internet regarding 'The Time Traveler's Wife' a fair number of people are disturbed by the scenes in which Henry visits his future wife Clare as a child. To them the scenes are unsavory as there is perhaps an unhealthy relationship between a child and a grown man suggested. For me there are no suggestions of an underlying sexual relationship between the characters. Fortunately the filmmakers did not deal with the problem of the time traveling daughterwouldn't she have also lost her clothes when hopping around in time? Now that would have been truly disturbing and I can see why the issue was not dealt with at alldespite adding to the entire implausibility of the plot.Speaking of the plot there is little tension as the story moves along. Part of the problem is that Henry is such a nonheroic sort of character. One wonders how he can hold a job as a librarian with all his time hopping. And then we see that he's not very industrious at all when he takes the easy way out and purchases the lottery ticket Clare also comes off badly as she goes against her gut instincts and agrees to keep the ticket and cash it in. Henry never develops as a character and we find out little about him. He's too busy losing his clothes and disappearing all the time. There's a bit of tension when Henry's best friend tells Clare not to marry him but then he disappears until the end of the movie. Also completely underdeveloped is Dr. Kendrick who potentially could have developed some kind of cure for Henry's predicament but never does.The central moment of the story occurs when Henry decides to get a vasectomy because he fears that his child might end up with the same genetic abnormality. Clare outwits him by having sex with a prevasectomy Henry and gives birth to Alba who of course also is a time traveler. The dark moment occurs when Henry is shot by Clare's Republican hunter father who mistakes him for a deer out in the woods. But since there are still time hopping Henry's out there he pays a visit to Clare and Alba after he dies and makes them feel better.The Time Traveler's Wife does have an intriguing premise and holds your interest to the end. Ultimately however we don't care about these characters precisely because they are not fleshed out as real people. It's a film that failed at the box office as both critics and the public agreed that the fantasy plot had too many implausibilities and none of the characters proved at all compelling. No amount of crocodile tears and whining by the Time Traveler's Wife that her husband never spends enough time at home can save this flick from devolving into what it is a predictable soap opera.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was disappointing not because of the two gorgeous touching stars or the cinematography but the story's fantasy premise has so many flaws so many inconsistencies that it collapses making the whole affair rather pointless in my opinion. So go with caution those of you who love romance or the two main cast members for you may be satisfied with these elements. The storyline features a gentleman Henry Eric Bana who as a child escaped from an horrific car accident by time traveling to a different place. The crash however killed his mother and drove his father to alcoholism. Continuing to travel throughout his life to different time periods and places he finds himself in a meadow one day where a beautiful little girl is preparing a picnic. She will grow up to be Claire Rachel McAdams and become the wife of the time traveler. Meeting again at a college library as adults the two fall desperately in love and marry but complications are always present. Claire a budding artist is often left to spend holidays alone and worries constantly for Henry sometimes travels into dangerous neighborhoods and situations. Then longing for a child the couple experiences acute disappointment time again through miscarriage. Although Henry uses his abilities to purchase a winning lottery ticket that buys them a lovely home and art studio will they ever be truly happy? And what about strong indications that Henry will die in his early forties in a violent way? As stated above there are elements to admire about this film. The two stars Bana and McAdams are attractive talented actors who work very hard to make the film a success. Also the lesser cast members including Ron Livingston and Arliss Howard do fine work as well. Then too the scenery is lovely from beautiful meadow to stately mansion and back again. Costumes and camera work are of the finest. It is unfortunately the story that is wanting and since it was a book first which I did not read yet this reviewer does not know if critical issues were left out that would have made a more sensible story. For example Henry always travels nude leaving a pile of clothes when he departs and arriving naked at his next venue causing him to have to steal the first available clothing. Why is this so? Can't clothes travel too? In addition questions about why he can travel to his own wedding nearly on time but have no control over other episodes is puzzling and that's just the start of a long list of inconsistencies. Because fantasy relies on a set of ground rules to be successful in my opinion this one doesn't work for me. The direction too is tentative and the flick has many slowly moving scenes. In summary if you love romance first and foremost you will probably want to see this film. All others however should ponder awhile about plunking down ten bucks for a ticket when it might be better to wait for the DVD or other low cost alternatives.".

	schema:headline " A Spiritual Experience";
	schema:reviewBody "My wife and I saw The Time Traveler's Wife today and came away emotionally moved. Because the film had such a strong impact on me I am adding the spoiler alert because I can only write this as though to someone who has already seen the movie. If you have not seen it then skip my review so you can enjoy it with a fresh experience like I did.First I came with low expectations. My wife bought the book and is reading it still. She left the movie in tears and I left rejoicing. She could not understand how I rejoiced in the movie while she saw the tragedy. So I told her...Henry's jumping around in time reminded me of Billy Pilgrim in Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughter House 5. In Vonnegut's story the happiest time in Pilgrim's life is when the aliens from the planet Tralfamador capture him and place him in a zoo so the Tralfamadorians could watch him mate with a captured movie star played by Valerie Perrine in the movie version of the book. The Tralfamadorians explain to him that time is frozen and that the end of the universe is already known and that Pilgrim should focus on enjoying this time with them instead of the misery of the fire bombing experiences in Dresden that he also time tripped to.This is what I came away from the story. I am glad that the sex violence and alcoholism in the book of the Time Traveler was not included the movie. By keeping the movie clean it took on a spirituality of love that transcended the story. Whether the author intended or the filmmakers I do not know but this is what I got from it.Henry loved the whole woman that Claire was. He knew her as a little girl by time travel and as a teen and the woman he married. His death did not end his love for her in my understanding of the story. I come to this conclusion because we see Henry time tripping into the future as a younger Henry before his death and visiting his wife and daughter. Since he had gaps of time when he was gone during the continuous time line of Claire there is no reason not to believe that he couldn't see Claire as an old woman too. So in spite of the irregular manner of their relationship Henry had the privilege of knowing and loving his wife all her life from child hood to old age. And since their daughter Alba inherited the gene that caused her to time trip too but she had control of her time tripping there is no reason in the logic of the story that she could not visit her father before his death not only as the young girl but when she is a grown woman. Therefore Henry through the time tripping of himself and his daughter would know both his wife and daughter in the fullness of their lives.As I watched the movie I could not help but see Henry's love like God's love towards us. For God knows us in the fullness of our lives. He knows us as little children He knows us as adults and as old people already since He is not in time at all and sees the beginning from the end. And the love of God covers the multitude of sins so while He knows our faults He chooses to look upon our virtues and believes the best in us.For Henry to realize and see his approaching death made him a type of Christ for me. While God became the man Jesus as Jesus he did not walk in omniscience. Rather he knew only what the Holy Spirit revealed to him. So Jesus knew his death and had a glimpse of the horror of it but trusted God and went through it nonetheless. Henry unlike Jesus of course had no choice. But His facing death touches the heart strings of all of us as we wonder about our own approaching deaths.I told my wife that I have come to love her in the same way. When I look at pictures of her as a little girl I love the little girl she is in the picture. Furthermore the Lord has worked in my life to love her for who she is in her essence that I am prepared to love her when her teeth fall out and is incapacitated with old age. This love I have for her is God's love for her flowing through me to her. So in this way I found the movie to be very spiritual.Besides even for us trapped in the time continuum that moves forward all our relationships are fragmented like Henry's already. We do not see anyone 100 of the time. Everyone comes and goes in our lives the same way. So like Billy Pilgrim who was advised to focus on the good experiences of his time tripping Claire could choose to focus on her good experiences with Henry and we with one another.".

	onyx:emotionText "My wife and I saw The Time Traveler's Wife today and came away emotionally moved. Because the film had such a strong impact on me I am adding the spoiler alert because I can only write this as though to someone who has already seen the movie. If you have not seen it then skip my review so you can enjoy it with a fresh experience like I did.First I came with low expectations. My wife bought the book and is reading it still. She left the movie in tears and I left rejoicing. She could not understand how I rejoiced in the movie while she saw the tragedy. So I told her...Henry's jumping around in time reminded me of Billy Pilgrim in Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughter House 5. In Vonnegut's story the happiest time in Pilgrim's life is when the aliens from the planet Tralfamador capture him and place him in a zoo so the Tralfamadorians could watch him mate with a captured movie star played by Valerie Perrine in the movie version of the book. The Tralfamadorians explain to him that time is frozen and that the end of the universe is already known and that Pilgrim should focus on enjoying this time with them instead of the misery of the fire bombing experiences in Dresden that he also time tripped to.This is what I came away from the story. I am glad that the sex violence and alcoholism in the book of the Time Traveler was not included the movie. By keeping the movie clean it took on a spirituality of love that transcended the story. Whether the author intended or the filmmakers I do not know but this is what I got from it.Henry loved the whole woman that Claire was. He knew her as a little girl by time travel and as a teen and the woman he married. His death did not end his love for her in my understanding of the story. I come to this conclusion because we see Henry time tripping into the future as a younger Henry before his death and visiting his wife and daughter. Since he had gaps of time when he was gone during the continuous time line of Claire there is no reason not to believe that he couldn't see Claire as an old woman too. So in spite of the irregular manner of their relationship Henry had the privilege of knowing and loving his wife all her life from child hood to old age. And since their daughter Alba inherited the gene that caused her to time trip too but she had control of her time tripping there is no reason in the logic of the story that she could not visit her father before his death not only as the young girl but when she is a grown woman. Therefore Henry through the time tripping of himself and his daughter would know both his wife and daughter in the fullness of their lives.As I watched the movie I could not help but see Henry's love like God's love towards us. For God knows us in the fullness of our lives. He knows us as little children He knows us as adults and as old people already since He is not in time at all and sees the beginning from the end. And the love of God covers the multitude of sins so while He knows our faults He chooses to look upon our virtues and believes the best in us.For Henry to realize and see his approaching death made him a type of Christ for me. While God became the man Jesus as Jesus he did not walk in omniscience. Rather he knew only what the Holy Spirit revealed to him. So Jesus knew his death and had a glimpse of the horror of it but trusted God and went through it nonetheless. Henry unlike Jesus of course had no choice. But His facing death touches the heart strings of all of us as we wonder about our own approaching deaths.I told my wife that I have come to love her in the same way. When I look at pictures of her as a little girl I love the little girl she is in the picture. Furthermore the Lord has worked in my life to love her for who she is in her essence that I am prepared to love her when her teeth fall out and is incapacitated with old age. This love I have for her is God's love for her flowing through me to her. So in this way I found the movie to be very spiritual.Besides even for us trapped in the time continuum that moves forward all our relationships are fragmented like Henry's already. We do not see anyone 100 of the time. Everyone comes and goes in our lives the same way. So like Billy Pilgrim who was advised to focus on the good experiences of his time tripping Claire could choose to focus on her good experiences with Henry and we with one another.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'll admit that after reading some early remarks about Robert Schwentke's cinematic version I was very worried in fact so much so that my expectations were somewhat low. This fact might have weighed on my ultimate decision concerning my enjoyment in seeing the DeTamble family's story on screen because I actually really bought in and was swept away for the journey. Yes a lot and I do mean a lot is omitted through the adaptation process of Oscarwinner Bruce Joel Rubin but enough is kept to stay true to that romantic tone. Distilled down and perhaps dumbeddown The Time Traveler's Wife may lose some of its geeky scifi flavor but the heart and soul remains intact to be a solid date movie and entry to the romance drama genre.I won't lie I was disappointed overall. So much of the backstory and many reasons for what occurs to some characters have been tossed aside. But this is completely understandable as New Line needed to make a return on the investment and they couldn't risk losing their entire audience by scaring the girls with its science fiction devices or the boys for its romantic tendencies. Instead they decided to market it as a love story to see with your significant other on a quiet evening out. On these terms I really can't fault the job that has been done. I bought into it all right from the start as the filmmakers throw you into the action. Not only do we see young Henry's first travel through time but we also witness the regular occasion of him meeting another version of himself at a different stage of life as well as the incident that shapes his life foreverthe passing of his mother in front of his eyes. There is no opportunity to waver in the belief of this man moving through time you see it straight away and then you continue on the journey to see what will occur as a result.The novel itself used the brilliant device of being told through the eyes of our two leads Henry and his soulmate Clare Abshire as diary entries. Alternating one with the other we experience what they do upon each meeting or journey hearing their thoughts as they anticipate the next rendezvous knowing how the one feels before seeing what the other felt at the exact same time. I believe this device could have been used effectively in film with voiceover narration however the screenwriter chose not to do so. Instead the film is pretty much a linear telling of the life of Clare probably the best entry point in being that the title does reference her she is the one who must cope with this man that she cannot live without yet can also never truly have to herself. We end up going back in time to see her as a child meeting a late30s Henry but only in flashbacks and memories from when the two 20something versions of them meet. You see the bond forming and fate working its way in setting a specific path as both tell each other future details they know because of the time traveling he telling a young girl what is in store and she telling a young man the words his elder self passed on.Are Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana ideal actors to portray these roles  I'm not so sure. They do however perform well and allow for some chemistry to give us cause to buy into the emotional turmoil they experience on a daily basis. Between the struggles to just see each other without Henry disappearing to the pains of miscarriages and the possibility that they may never have children to the knowledge of so much that will happen and trying to still believe they are making choices the DeTambles are not your normal family by any means. What made the book so wonderful was the realism in the fictional heartaches and consequences of being with or just plain knowing someone with chrono displacement syndrome. And I do believe our main characters carry that weight enough to draw a skeptic in. The other reason for Niffenegger's novel's genius is the large supporting cast each with a history to themselves and a crucial part to play in the life of Henry and Clare. Unfortunately in order to devote time to this tragic couple's progression in less than two hours almost all the nuance is gone. What I wouldn't give for this to have been a miniseries or even a season of television so it could breath life into everyone.You also never understand the sense of danger in what happens to Henry. Sure you see him pick some locks and get into fights but what about the reason for why he ends up in a wheelchair? I know they have that one line about hypothermia and being stuck in the snow but that story is so much bigger. By making it about Clare and how her life is affected you only see Henry's condition as a nuisance rather than a lifethreatening affliction that could tear them apart forever I liked the very intriguing Joy Division cover at the wedding pertaining to this fact. As a result the film's ending is similar to the book but in my opinion not quite as memorable or important. Again though just because I know the novel is a masterpiece should not detract me from the film it is its own entity. On the movie The Time Traveler's Wife's merits alone I am happy to say it is well worth the time. You still have to buy into the whole time travel thing but rather than take the leap of faith scientifically with the printed version you only need to want to see these two lovers grow old together. You pull for them to live happily ever after and frankly that is what a good romantic drama should do.".

I like a complex plot but this film never had a plot to lose. During the wedding scene the time traveller travels to the future only to travel back 10 minutes later as an older man just in time to get married. Remember this is a person that has no control over where when or how long he travels.I missed the part where he lost his foot due to falling asleep for 10 minutes large parts of the film's dialogue is conducted in sleep inducing whispers which led me to feel that I had entered some kind of nightmarish lullaby.Utter rubbish.".

Oh how I feel let down.I wish I could travel back in time and smash this disc into pieces rather than commit the cinematic crime of inserting this nonsense into my DVD player does anyone know if it's possible to fumigate a DVD player?.The film is a confusing mess and unless you've read the book you'll find this film just plain annoying. I like a complex plot but this film never had a plot to lose. During the wedding scene the time traveller travels to the future only to travel back 10 minutes later as an older man just in time to get married. Remember this is a person that has no control over where when or how long he travels.I missed the part where he lost his foot due to falling asleep for 10 minutes large parts of the film's dialogue is conducted in sleep inducing whispers which led me to feel that I had entered some kind of nightmarish lullaby.Utter rubbish.";

The romance is undercut by having Mr. Time Traveller encounter his great love when he is age 35 and she is a child of 8 eight. I'm not kidding! Anyway this time traveler is supposed to be a research assistant at a library but this also is nonsense because nobody  except maybe Lindsay Lohan  can hold a job when they're absent 90 of the time. So his real living is made stealing other men's clothes which sometimes includes a wallet. His true love sits around with no real life no friends empty holidays while waiting for an occasional visit from Mr. TT.If you've seen other time travel movies remember them. Most of them were entertaining and interesting. This one is not.Big spoiler. Mr TT is a Chicago Democrat and eventually he'll meet his death by being accidentally shot in a hunting accident by his Republican fatherinlaw.

But of course you might say it's not fair to compare the book to the movie and I guess it really isn't. Although I'm beginning to see why some people call Eric Bana's acting abilities into question he Rachel McAdams Clare and Hailey McCann Alba actually managed to pull off a pretty convincing portrait of a loving family. As to those who gripe about the lack of scientific explanations why exactly DOES he time travel again? I completely agree with youI am more a scifi fan than a romancedrama but we have to remember that the film isn't SUPPOSED to be scifi. The timetraveling should be seen more as the metaphorical obstacle which tests the couple's love and proves WHY we should give a damn as to whether or not they deserve a happy ending. That's how good storytelling works. As for the movie's endingI loved it. It was uplifting and bittersweet but you got the impression that Clare and Alba would manage on their own. Clare has more of a backbone in the movie she doesn't in the book yes yes I know. I promised I wouldn't compare the bookmovie. But by the final scene of the movie I was convinced that this couple proved that they loved each other. It's a movie. That's all there is. Much better than the book's ending where she brainlessly waits for him until she's 80 after his death. Ugh. Now THAT was depressing!".

	schema:reviewBody "2002's 'City By the Sea' was a film that slipped by me when it first came out. I was living overseas and missed it completely. Having finally had a chance to watch it I think it is the best film that Robert DeNiro has been in since 'Ronin' and up to 2006 his last great dramatic performance. He stars in 'City By the Sea' as the absentee father of James Franco. DeNiro is a decorated homicide cop who while investigating a murder finds uncomfortable evidence that concretely links his son to the murder. The film becomes a redemptive tale as DeNiro's character tries to make up for the damage of the lost years and save his son from a series of rapidly expanding catastrophes.'City By the Sea' borrows from the noir tradition with a gritty locale seedy characters and two male leads who have unlocked a series of events that are bigger than they are. DeNiro and Franco are both excellent here. Franco is tremendous for the entire film as a junkie who is trying perhaps not very hard to escape from his current life for one mixed of fantasy and memory. His final scenes with De Niro are powerful.The DeNiro performance? I think that he played it perfectly. His character in the film tends to be very restrained and controlled. He analyzes and then makes his move. Part of this has to do with the background of the character. He hides his past because he's trying to protect his own vulnerabilities. By the time we reach the climactic scene towards the end of the film with his son the restraint and control are gone. He is trying to save his son and the impassioned speech he gives is some of the best work I've seen him do. 'City By the Sea' is more of a redemptive drama than a crime drama and I think that the way the film was packaged and marketed may have confused that. In the climactic scene with Franco you see the culmination of a great performance by a great actor. I was more impressed by the emotion and power of that scene than I was by anything else I've watched in quite a while.'City By the Sea' is slow but worth the journey. Very good acting all around and you might very well be a James Franco fan after seeing this if you weren't before.".

He plays a policeman who is a father to his druggie son who is accused of murder. Vincent LaMarca De Niro is torn between the guilt of being an absentee father to his kid Joey played by James Franco but still loving him enough to help him and yet still be a good honest cop.This is a gritty film a bid sordid in spots. The locale is a grimy Atlantici Citytype onthe skids town by the ocean. It isn't pretty. As tough as the story can be it's still interesting and recommended as a decent crime film. Actually it's much more of a drama than an actioncrime film....but I liked it. It's an interesting character study as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "City by the Sea starring Robert DeNiro and Frances McDormand Fargo  Almost Famous is an exciting and heartfelt melodrama.  Director Michael CatonJones proves himself with one of his greatest efforts to date bouncing back from his previous disappointing and misdirected film The Jackal.  CatonJones displays a style all his own with stunning atmospheric poignancy.  The city by the sea to which the film refers to is Long Island N.Y. a wonderfully lonely and dilapidated city to where junkie Jimmy Nova DeNiro's son calls home.DeNiro plays a wellrespected cop with a terribly troubled past that seems to constantly haunt him.  His exwife played by Patti Lupone struggles to get over the violence of their past relationship while his son played by James Franco is headed down the same path as DeNiro's father once was that of an alleged? murderer.  Jimmy Nova as he's known around town mixes with the wrong crowd as do most junkies and one night finds himself struggling for his life and before he knows it stabbing and killing a high profile drug dealer.  This relatively small act of selfdefense cascades a sequence of irreversible events which never seem to let up until the end.  DeNiro of course is assigned to the case and unknowingly hunts down his own son who he hasn't seen or heard from in several years.  Both father and son have moved on with their lives since their seperation but still harbor intense emotional feelings for each other that seem to slowly emerge further and further into the film.  To top it all off the two men are involved in complex relationships of their own which naturally complicates things further. DeNiro's relationship with Frances McDormand seems quite convenient at times but nonetheless shows the tenderness and compassion of both characters while Franco's relationship feels more like a fling with multiple strings attached.  In the end both DeNiro and his son must face the issues that have plagued them for three generations and make one of the hardest decisions of their life.Similar topics and themes in City by the Sea were explored in Road to Perdition however it is the way that they are explored that keeps the film feeling fresh and unique.   Similar themes explored are the fatherson relationship the destructive path of violence and crime and most importantly the will and courage to fight for a second chance at life. I was particularly impressed with the atmospheric mood of New York that CatonJones set from the beginning reminiscent of Scorcese's Taxi Driver thus giving the film the reality that many recent Hollywood films tend to lack.  The acting in this film is of the highest quality and will not be overlooked contending with so".

	schema:reviewBody "The trailer and ads for this film may make you think that this is just another cop film with Robert DeNiro but the truth is that its a lot more. This story is loosely based on fact and it seems a natural to be made into a film. Story starts out with an 18 year old boy named Joey James Franco who is a drug addict and during an altercation with a pusher Joey stabs him and kills him. The next day Detective Vincent LaMarca Robert DeNiro and his partner Reg George Dzundza investigate the killing and later find out that Vincent's son Joey is responsible. Vincent is divorced from Maggie Patti Lupone and has not seen his son for 14 years. Vincent lives in an apartment and he is casually dating Michelle Frances McDormand who lives upstairs from him. Meanwhile a drug supplier called Spyder William Forsythe is looking for Joey because he thinks he has his 4000 dollars which he doesn't. Once it is known that Vincents son is involved he is taken off the case and Reg is put in charge of the investigation.SPOILER ALERTReg goes to an old building on Long Beach Long Island where Joey is known to hang out but Reg surprises Spyder and gets shot and killed. Now the police think Joey killed him and Vincent has a lot to think about. Vincent's own father was executed in 1959 for killing a child and now his own son is involved in a terrible crime. Vincent meets Joey's girlfriend Gina Eliza Dushku and finds out that he is a grandfather and now he must make sure that his own grandson doesn't follow the same fate. This film was directed by Michael CatonJones and its the second film that he and DeNiro have worked on together and the first was This Boy's Life. What separates this from other cop films is a very strong performance by DeNiro. He has been criticized in the past for giving uninspired performances but thats not the case here. DeNiro had to do some real digging to deliver a character that is haunted by his past and now doesn't have a choice but to confront it and try to make amends. At the beginning we see Vincent as a cop who always says that those responsible must pay. Then later in the film he hands in his gun and badge which were two things he could hide behind when dealing with personal issues. After that he is free to confront everything that he has dodged for years. DeNiro shows real layers to his character and as the film unfolds these layers are slowly peeled back exposing himself as more than just a tough cop. I wasn't as excited by Franco's performance although they're are a few moments when confronting his father where he shows some real angst in his eyes. But for the most part his role comes across as James Dean in Rebel Without A Cause. Its hard to believe that its been 25 years since DeNiro and Dzundza were in The Deer Hunter together and this is the first time since than that they have worked together. Film is definitely more interesting than I expected and DeNiro's performance is exceptional.".

Once it is known that Vincents son is involved he is taken off the case and Reg is put in charge of the investigation.SPOILER ALERTReg goes to an old building on Long Beach Long Island where Joey is known to hang out but Reg surprises Spyder and gets shot and killed. Now the police think Joey killed him and Vincent has a lot to think about. Vincent's own father was executed in 1959 for killing a child and now his own son is involved in a terrible crime. Vincent meets Joey's girlfriend Gina Eliza Dushku and finds out that he is a grandfather and now he must make sure that his own grandson doesn't follow the same fate. This film was directed by Michael CatonJones and its the second film that he and DeNiro have worked on together and the first was This Boy's Life. What separates this from other cop films is a very strong performance by DeNiro. He has been criticized in the past for giving uninspired performances but thats not the case here. DeNiro had to do some real digging to deliver a character that is haunted by his past and now doesn't have a choice but to confront it and try to make amends. At the beginning we see Vincent as a cop who always says that those responsible must pay. Then later in the film he hands in his gun and badge which were two things he could hide behind when dealing with personal issues. After that he is free to confront everything that he has dodged for years. DeNiro shows real layers to his character and as the film unfolds these layers are slowly peeled back exposing himself as more than just a tough cop. I wasn't as excited by Franco's performance although they're are a few moments when confronting his father where he shows some real angst in his eyes. But for the most part his role comes across as James Dean in Rebel Without A Cause. Its hard to believe that its been 25 years since DeNiro and Dzundza were in The Deer Hunter together and this is the first time since than that they have worked together. Film is definitely more interesting than I expected and DeNiro's performance is exceptional.";

It's also a good example of when Hollywood stops manufacturing plastic fluff and uses well developed characterizations to tell a really gripping story. The depth of sadness is palatable and compelling. No glossy sets no wannabe starlets just brilliant acting excellent casting sharp direction and a really good script and storyline.

The soul of this film is hidden beneath the surface of the familiar copsandcrooks premise.Vincent LaMarca Robert DeNiro is a wellrespected veteran NYPD homicide detective who is sent to investigate a murder in Long Beach  a once prosperous and now badly dilapidated Long Island community known as the City by the Sea. The victim is a seedy drug dealer. The official suspect is Vincent's longlost son.

He and Vincent have been estranged for over a decade following an ugly divorce that resulted in the detective seeking refuge miles away in the comfort of Manhattan and his police work. Faced with the task of bringing the killer to justice the detective concurrently embarks on a mission to try and save his son. As his investigation progresses Vincent forces himself to finally face the music about his shortcomings as a father figure and the role it has played in Joey's destructive lifestyle.Director Michael CatonJones makes up for lack of suspense with sharp cinematography a tense argument between Vincent and his exwife is shot with a handheld and the crafting of a morbidly captivating world inhabited by a myriad of characters such as Reg Duffy George Dzundza Vincent's closest friend on the force plus Vincent's caring but stern girlfriend Frances McDormand a revengebent drug dealer William Forsythe and a struggling single mother Eliza Dushku whose child Joey fathered. Ken Hixon's script paints Vincent in a perplexing light Do we share his pain resulting from his son's situation or revile him instead for leaving Joey in the lurch years ago? However the gradual reparation of this distraught relationship comes at the expense of the aforementioned supporting cast whose importance to the plot dwindles as the abrupt hackneyed climax nears. But these flaws are forgivable due to DeNiro's performance in an emotionally hardhitting role that ironically parallels Al Pacino's similar portrayal of a mentallytortured cop facing up to the consequences of his actions in the 2002 summer hit Insomnia. The miserable deterioration of Long Beach serves as a unique metaphor for Vincent's downward spiral though it's much more difficult to repair a damaged psyche than the repudiated remains of a casino.  810".

Yet it's well worth inspection by those film fans who appreciate a crisp screenplay and top line acting.De Niro is on form without doubt but he is clearly helped by having actors around him who can compete on the same terms. There's a believability to the core relationships in the film be it De Niro and Franco as father and son or De Niro and McDormand as lovers the writing calls for actors of strength to hold court and make this dialogue heavy picture worth attention. And they do very much so.Narratively the piece thrives on irony and the great old noir staple of past events looming large over a protagonist. Primarily it's about how Vincent deals with the splinters of his past suddenly surfacing in his life. This proves to make the film more a drama than a thriller there are no high octane deaths and dismemberment's no back street alleyway wackings this is very much a character driven unpretentious and emotionally affecting movie.Just like his actors CatonJones is perfectly restrained his direction has a nice flow that aids the story no tricks are needed to beef up the human interest. He allows the principal character's stories to build making sure that Hixon's adult screenplay comes to the fore that character reactions are not twee or too far fetched. In fact it's very refreshing to see the way McDormand's girlfriend reacts to the new information she has to deal with in her love life. Visually there's some lovely work by Lindenlaub Rob Roy where nightscapes and a red sunset stand tall and proud and Murphy's score is thankfully unobtrusive given the nature of the story. 710".

This murder investigation is drawing Vincent home to Long Beach the selfproclaimed City by the Sea where the past has been waiting for him to return. The agonizing memory that has tortured him all his life  the death of his father a convicted murderer who was executed when Vincent was just a boy  still plagues him.

It's one of his gentlest most quietly affecting performances. This is one of his strongest performances to date and one of the year's best. Franco meets the challenge of his role opposite De Niro by playing a younger version of his father as he too struggles to make the right life decisions regarding his crime and drug use. Also strong in this ensemble work is Frances McDormand whose love for Vincent pushes the limits of her commitment to him and arouses equally difficult choices for her as a result City by the Sea is a painful look at how the emotional years of faulty parenting can affect the relationships between fathers and sons as well as the innocent loved ones surrounding them.All in all this tense drama is an entertaining movie with great performances.

After directing criticallyacclaimed films like Rob Roy This Boy's Life and now City by the Sea we will certainly hear from CatonJones in a near future.An underrated melancholic drama. 810".

His character's private life is lonely but as a cop he is respected and good.  Not too much bangbang action a couple of murders some drugs police bureaucracy stuff and one bad guy Snake.

Maybe they should stick to Twilight and light weight popcorn movies as after all this a a dark gritty drama for grown ups. The casting is brilliant with everyone playing their part extremely well.Yes I can see why people always go on about James Franco being a junkie in real life especially with performances like this and Pineapple Express no one does it better but that's what you call great acting.He basically went toe to toe with Robert De Niro who hand picked him after seeing James Franco as James Dean and came out his equal. Maybe just maybe Robert De Niro might have passed his succession to James Franco. No wonder his getting Oscars nominations now etc and only matter of time before he wins a few.I actually forgot that I watched this movie when it originally came out. I went to the supermarket recently and purchased a copy as it was very cheap and found a a true gem that I had forgotten. I felt I had to write a review because I couldn't believe the rating and some of the comments.I'm not going to breakdown what happens in the story there's enough evidence of that already but wow. If you want amazing acting by all and true essence of what a great drama should be you might have seen similar formats in the past but was it ever acted as well as this then I suggest you rent or buy it.I'm so glad I have this as part of my DVD collection. Not every movie has to have plenty of car chasing be in 3D naked ladies etc.Sometimes you just need a strong cast to bring a good story home and for me they brought it home plenty. Can't believe this movie didn't get any Oscar nominations. I can be critical like the next person thinking not another cop drama but seriously can't stress this enough open your mind to solid acting by all cast members and you will be truly surprised.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sudden Impact 1983  Inspector Harry Callahan Clint Eastwood meets Death Wish! That sounds amazing which it is. The only Dirty Harry directed by Clint Eastwood himself whiteout a question among the finest pictures of the 80's if is not for the best Magnum Force one of my favorite Dirty Harry movies in the franchise ever!!! It is one of my personal favorite action movies of all time. The fourth installment of Dirty Harry series is one of the most astonish best and greatest Eastwood's masterpiece! I don't care what anyone say's I love this movie to death. It has the greatest and the most finest action in the 80's from Clint Eastwood. This movie is even miles way better than The Enforcer! This movie is a bad ass! Harry's line Go ahead make my day is one of the most memorable praise since Dirty Harry 1971. A long to discover that Dirty Harry is Batman! Why can't they make bad ass action movies like this one is? I will always watch this action flick from Clint Eastwood. This movie is what it is a perfect 10 because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task  actors stunts and a lot action sequences in here with a great story.The Death Wish chapter of the Dirty Harry saga and another high point in the action genre containing an amount of masculine bad ass to make anyone grow their chest hair. Also the 475 Magnum montage had me in stitches. Sudden Impact allowed Harry to interact with someone who shares his mindset of justice. Definitely the darkest of the Dirty Harry movies. In my opinion the best in the series. The rapist got raped by a .44 Auto Mag and then by a unicorn horn. I saw that one coming in the chase scene at the carousel. Clint Eastwood was Batman back when Batman was sipping' martinis and dancing in Studio 54. The film is absolutely filled with great classic moments I counted TEN allstar ones during my last viewing and they're evenly spaced through the movie. Great acting and a plot worthy of the title character. Great cinematography. What else can I say buy it you will not be disappointed. This has to be one of Eastwood's best movie. Okay they are all good but this one will make your day!The Dirty Harry films were in hiatus for 7.years since no one wanted to make a Dirty Harry Clint Eastwood made a fourth installment with a bad ass action film ever! Inspector Dirty Harry Callahan Clint Eastwood carries his Smith  Wesson Model 29 .44 Magnum as his sidearm in the film. He is first seen pulling it in the coffee shop and saying what is one of the most famous movie lines in history. The SW is used until it is kicked into a curb drain by Mick Paul Drake. He then uses his AMC Auto Mag Pistol in .44 AMP as a replacement. This is different style of Harry using different weapon by the end of the movie. Sudden Impact is the fourth installment in the Dirty Harry film franchise and the only Dirty Harry film to be directed by Clint Eastwood himself. Eastwood returns as Inspector Dirty Harry Callahan who visits a small Northern California city while on leave from the department and finds himself encountering a woman Sondra Locke with a vendetta against some of the town's citizens. The 1983 sequel also is the sequel where Eastwood utters the immortal line Go ahead make my day while holding his Smith  Wesson Model 29. Sudden Impact also made popular the use of the .44 Magnum AMP Auto Mag Model 180. Sudden Impact is a 1983 American action film and the fourth film in the Dirty Harry series directed by Clint Eastwood making it the only Dirty Harry film to be directed by Eastwood himself and starring Eastwood and Sondra Locke.This is the basic plot of the movie it is a revenge flick about a rape victim who murderous spree of revenge puts his own ideas of justice to the test! I grew up with this movie and I still love it even tough this flick was really dark Sondra Locke played in it Clint Eastwood's girlfriend at the time. They made many movies together including The Outlaw Josey Wales 1976 The Gauntlet 1977 Every Which Way But Loose 1978 and Any Which Way You Can. Sudden Impact 1983 was the last movie Sondra made with Clint Eastwood together. I think Clint did a terrific job of directing and producing his last and the only Dirty Harry movie. I still prefer Dirty Harry and Magnum Force as two of the best movies but this is my third best movie of Dirty Harry and Clint Eastwood. This movie is a perfect 10.".

This movie is a bad ass! Harry's line Go ahead make my day is one of the most memorable praise since Dirty Harry 1971. A long to discover that Dirty Harry is Batman! Why can't they make bad ass action movies like this one is? I will always watch this action flick from Clint Eastwood. This movie is what it is a perfect 10 because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task  actors stunts and a lot action sequences in here with a great story.The Death Wish chapter of the Dirty Harry saga and another high point in the action genre containing an amount of masculine bad ass to make anyone grow their chest hair. Also the 475 Magnum montage had me in stitches. Sudden Impact allowed Harry to interact with someone who shares his mindset of justice. Definitely the darkest of the Dirty Harry movies. In my opinion the best in the series. The rapist got raped by a .44 Auto Mag and then by a unicorn horn. I saw that one coming in the chase scene at the carousel. Clint Eastwood was Batman back when Batman was sipping' martinis and dancing in Studio 54. The film is absolutely filled with great classic moments I counted TEN allstar ones during my last viewing and they're evenly spaced through the movie. Great acting and a plot worthy of the title character. Great cinematography. What else can I say buy it you will not be disappointed. This has to be one of Eastwood's best movie. Okay they are all good but this one will make your day!The Dirty Harry films were in hiatus for 7.years since no one wanted to make a Dirty Harry Clint Eastwood made a fourth installment with a bad ass action film ever! Inspector Dirty Harry Callahan Clint Eastwood carries his Smith  Wesson Model 29 .44 Magnum as his sidearm in the film. He is first seen pulling it in the coffee shop and saying what is one of the most famous movie lines in history. The SW is used until it is kicked into a curb drain by Mick Paul Drake. He then uses his AMC Auto Mag Pistol in .44 AMP as a replacement. This is different style of Harry using different weapon by the end of the movie. Sudden Impact is the fourth installment in the Dirty Harry film franchise and the only Dirty Harry film to be directed by Clint Eastwood himself. Eastwood returns as Inspector Dirty Harry Callahan who visits a small Northern California city while on leave from the department and finds himself encountering a woman Sondra Locke with a vendetta against some of the town's citizens. The 1983 sequel also is the sequel where Eastwood utters the immortal line Go ahead make my day while holding his Smith  Wesson Model 29. Sudden Impact also made popular the use of the .44 Magnum AMP Auto Mag Model 180. Sudden Impact is a 1983 American action film and the fourth film in the Dirty Harry series directed by Clint Eastwood making it the only Dirty Harry film to be directed by Eastwood himself and starring Eastwood and Sondra Locke.This is the basic plot of the movie it is a revenge flick about a rape victim who murderous spree of revenge puts his own ideas of justice to the test! I grew up with this movie and I still love it even tough this flick was really dark Sondra Locke played in it Clint Eastwood's girlfriend at the time. They made many movies together including The Outlaw Josey Wales 1976 The Gauntlet 1977 Every Which Way But Loose 1978 and Any Which Way You Can. Sudden Impact 1983 was the last movie Sondra made with Clint Eastwood together. I think Clint did a terrific job of directing and producing his last and the only Dirty Harry movie. I still prefer Dirty Harry and Magnum Force as two of the best movies but this is my third best movie of Dirty Harry and Clint Eastwood. This movie is a perfect 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "The vigilante has long held a fascination for audiences inasmuch as it evokes a sense of swift sure justice good triumphs over evil and the bad guy gets his deserts.  It is in fact one of the things that has made the character of Dirty Harry Callahan as played by Clint Eastwood so popular. He carries a badge and works within the law but at heart Harry is a vigilante meting out justice his' way which often puts him in conflict with his own superiors as well as the criminals he's pursuing.  But it's what draws the audience anyone who's ever been bogged down in bureaucratic nonsense of one kind or another delights in seeing someone cut through the red tape and get on with it even if it's only on the screen.  And that satisfaction derived from seeing justice done and quickly is one of the elements that makes Sudden Impact' directed by and starring Eastwood so successful.  In this one the fourth of the series while working a homicide Harry encounters a bona fide vigilante at work an individual whose brand of justice parallels his own with one exception  Whoever it is he's definitely not carrying a badge.In his own inimitable way Inspector Callahan has once again ended up on the bad side of the department and is ordered to take some vacation time.  So he does as only Dirty Harry' can.  In a small town north of San Francisco Harry finds himself smack dab in the middle of a homicide case which he quickly links to a recent murder in San Francisco because of the unique M.O. employed by the perpetrator.  Unaccountably Harry encounters resistance from the local Police Chief Jannings Pat Hingle who advises him to take his big city tactics and methods elsewhere.  Not one to be deterred however Harry continues his investigation which ultimately involves a beautiful and talented young artist Jennifer Spencer Sondra Locke. Gradually Harry discovers a link between the victims the burning question though is where does Jennifer Spencer fit into the picture?Eastwood is in top form here both in front of and behind the camera and it is arguably the second best of the fivefilm series right behind the original Dirty Harry.'  It had been seven years since the last Harry' offering The Enforcer' 1976 but Eastwood steps right back into the character with facility and renewed vigor.  And this one definitely benefits from having him in the director's chair as he is able to recapture the essence of not only his own character but that spirit' that made these films so successful and he does it by knowing the territory and establishing a continuity that all but erases that seven year gap between s 3 and 4.  As with all the films he directs Eastwood sets a deliberate pace that works perfectly for this material and creates just enough tension to keep it interesting and involving from beginning to end. The screenplay by Joseph Stinson is well written and formulated to that distinctive Dirty Harry' style the dialogue is snappy and the story itself conceived by Charles B. Pierce and Earl E. Smith is the most engaging since the original Dirty Harry' as it successfully endeavors to play upon the very personal aspects of the drama rather than entirely upon the action.  The characters are well drawn and convincing and of course this is the film that gave us one of Harry's best catchphrases  Go ahead make my day...'As Harry Clint Eastwood perfectly embodies all of the elements that make this character so popular  He lives by a personal moral code a true individual made of the kind of stuff we envision as that of the pioneers who settled this country and made America what it is today.  Harry personifies that sense of freedom and justice we all strive for and hold so dear possibly more so today than ever before.  No matter who we are or where we come from there's undeniably a part of us that wants to be Harry or at least have him around.  Dirty Harry' is an icon of the cinema and it's impossible to envision anyone but Eastwood portraying him for better or worse Eastwood is' Dirty Harry without question just as Sean Connery is James Bond and Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes.Sondra Locke is entirely effective here in the role of Jennifer Spencer a young woman wronged and out for vengeance or as she sees it justice.' She manages to bring a hardedged determination laced with vulnerability to her character with a convincing introspective approach that is far beyond what is typical of the action' genre.  Even amid the violence Locke keeps her focus on Jennifer and the traumatic events that have brought her to this stage of her life.  Her portrayal makes a perfect complement to Eastwood's Harry and becomes in philosophy and deed something of his counterpart.In supporting roles two performances stand out  Paul Drake as Mick creates the best psycho' since Andy Robinson's dynamic portrayal of the serial killer in the original Dirty Harry.'  With actually very limited screen time Drake establishes a genuinely disconcerting presence that is believable and convincing which adds much to the purely visceral response of the audience.  This is the guy you can't wait to see Harry take care of in the end.  Also effective is Audrie J. Neenan who makes her character Ray Parkins the epitome of the proverbial low life' who can be found in any bar in any city.  It's a performance that evokes a gutlevel response and it adds greatly to the credibility of the film in that it helps provide that necessary sense of realism.The supporting cast includes Albert Popwell Horace Mark Kevloun Bennett and Nancy Parsons Mrs. Kruger.  With a perfect blend of drama and action Sudden Impact' dispenses justice that is a fulfilling respite from reality the perfect justice of a notsoperfect world that makes for a satisfying cinematic experience.  910.".

	schema:headline " Fourth Dirty Harry entry changes the formula to a darker characterdriven style.... interesting but not wholly successful.";
	schema:reviewBody "Sudden Impact is the most unusual of the five Dirty Harry movies but that doesn't make it the best. However after the rather flat and comicbook heroics of the third film The Enforcer it's good to see some changes to the formula. Sudden Impact is quite a dark moody piece of cinema with big emphasis on character. Yes there's action but the action in this one is only one piece of the jigsaw whereas in some of the other Dirty Harry outings the action was everything. Harry Callahan Eastwood is in hot water with his superiors for carrying out an illegal search on a suspicious car. The young thugs he arrested are released because of the lack of evidence and they set out to take revenge on Harry. However Harry is a tough nut to crack  and pretty soon he is striking back in his own destructive style. Harry's boss decides to get Harry out of town for a while to avoid further bloodshed so he assigns him to a quiet murder investigation in an isolated coastal town. Harry pieces together the mystery and discovers that the killer is a female artist Locke who is bumping off a bunch of dropouts who gangraped her and her sister years previously. Should he arrest her for the killings or should he turn a blind eye and let her do away with these repellent scumbags? The film is probably the second best in the series the original is always going to be considered the best. Peculiarly it is the only Dirty Harry movie upon which Eastwood also doubled up as director. It isn't a whole success with some needless scenes what's the point of the sequence detailing the holdup of a coffee shop? and a couple of overly hammy performances by the main villains especially the trailer trash redhead. On the whole though this is a very interesting and unusual addition to the series which gets by on the strength of being totally different to all the other four episodes.".

	schema:reviewBody "A rape victim is going around bumping off her attackers one by one having been denied justice originally. A rather unconventional detective Callahan is put on the case.. but whose side will he take?This is one of the most brutal films I've seen in quite some time. Virtually every scene seems to be a setup for some punks to make the mistake of annoying our hero who then proceeds to beat the living daylights out of them or simply blows their heads off. I am 100 convinced that if any serving officer did what the Eastwood character gets away with in this film he would not only be stripped of his badge but also be looking at a considerable stretch in prison. Another striking aspect of the picture is the violence used against the fairer sex. The female cast members get punched in the face kicked when on they're on the ground.. And that doesn't even include the constant flashbacks we get of Sondra Locke's sexual assault ordeal We get one every time she carries out one of her revenge attacks on her aggressors. The misogyny displayed on screen is incredible and is unlikely to endear itself to anyone concerned about domestic violence.So why am I recommending it? Well for a start the film is well directed with some very exciting gunfights and car chases which will keep you on the edge of your seat. But the main reason for watching is Clint himself the evergreen icon giving us another classy performance as a veteran cop who might not share the ethics of the modern police force but tends to do the job 10x better than his colleagues who do it all 'by the book'. If only we had someone like that here in Britain perhaps this country wouldn't be the crime hotspot it is these days.. 610".

And that doesn't even include the constant flashbacks we get of Sondra Locke's sexual assault ordeal We get one every time she carries out one of her revenge attacks on her aggressors. The misogyny displayed on screen is incredible and is unlikely to endear itself to anyone concerned about domestic violence.So why am I recommending it? Well for a start the film is well directed with some very exciting gunfights and car chases which will keep you on the edge of your seat. But the main reason for watching is Clint himself the evergreen icon giving us another classy performance as a veteran cop who might not share the ethics of the modern police force but tends to do the job 10x better than his colleagues who do it all 'by the book'. If only we had someone like that here in Britain perhaps this country wouldn't be the crime hotspot it is these days.. 610";

However due to his less thanorthodox approach in dealing with criminals he is subsequently ordered to the small coastal town of San Paulo to pursue whatever leads he can find related to that specific investigation. Although this assignment began as a simple ploy by his supervisors to get him out of San Francisco for a while as luck would have it another murder is then committed in San Paulo that matches the same pattern of the first crimeand leads Harry to soon realize that the killer operates somewhere in this small town! Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a pretty good film which was almost ruined by one particular scene involving a small toy car chasing Inspector Callahan all though the streets of San Francisco. While it may have been cute at first I thought it got quite ridiculous after several minutes or so. But that is just my opinion. In any case while this wasn't a bad film by any means I didn't think it was nearly as good as the three previous films in the Dirty Harry series and for that reason I have rated it accordingly.

This really detracts from the presence of the main character who ruled all of his previous film appearances with pardon the pun Magnum Force.On the bright side this new storyline does draw several parallels to Harry's own unorthodox methods and gives his character dramatic depth that was not there before but fans that were looking for another badass Harry outing will more than likely be somewhat disappointed.

	schema:reviewBody "In the first three Dirty Harry movies Detective Inspector Harry Callahan Clint Eastwood was seen as the maverick cop whose contempt for his superiors the justice system and the rulebook regularly got him into trouble and in Sudden Impact nothing has really changed. He continues to survive in his job because his unorthodox methods get results but periodically the costs of his actions in terms of expenses physical destruction and bad publicity become so great that he temporarily has to be taken out of the firing line for the benefit of everyone involved.One of these situations arises again after the San Francisco cop shoots dead a whole group of criminals who were robbing a diner and then shortly after confronts a local crime boss at his granddaughter's wedding in such a way that the old man suffers a fatal heart attack. Callahan typically is furious about being forced to take an unscheduled vacation but is left with no other choice.Unfortunately when he's on vacation Callahan gets attacked by a group of the crime boss' men and kills three of them before eliminating another group of thugs who try to kill him because he'd arrested one of their number who'd recently appeared in court but had been freed on a technicality. In the circumstances Callahan gets assigned to a murder case which takes him to San Paulo a nearby small town where he becomes friendly with a woman called Jennifer Spencer Sondra Locke and also finds that the local police chief Lester Jennings Pat Hingle is openly hostile to the presence of a big city cop and has no intention of providing any assistance or cooperation.More killings which are all carried out in the same way follow and Callahan discovers that ten years earlier the victims were all involved in the brutal gangrape of Jennifer Spencer and her younger sister who'd remained in a catatonic state ever since. Callahan's methods for bringing murderers to justice are normally very simple and straight forward but in this case he decides that a rather different course of action is more appropriate.Sudden Impact delivers its entertaining combination of action and humour at a brisk pace and features a punchy script which is full of witty oneliners and of course the legendary catchphrase Go ahead. Make my day. The quality of the acting is very effective throughout with Clint Eastwood on great form. This was the only movie in the Dirty Harry series that Eastwood also directed and his work in relation to the action sequences and those where he makes good use of light and shadows to create the desired atmosphere are top class.Every crime thriller needs an interesting villain and Jennifer Spencer certainly fits the bill because she's a tragic victim a brutal serial killer and also an artist whose works express her anguish very powerfully. This traumatised woman with a blank expression had for ten years harboured her hatred of the rapists and her absolute despair for her sister's predicament and although she might have derived some shortterm satisfaction from carrying out her killing spree it definitely wouldn't have brought her any closer to a cure for her ills.Audiences know exactly what they're going to get with a Dirty Harry film and on the evidence of the huge box office receipts for Sudden Impact noone was disappointed this time around.".

I was also surprised when Clint's famous 'make me day' line cropped up in this film I was sure it was from something more famous.Sudden Impact to me is certainly the third best Dirty Harry flick. The plot is an interesting twist for Harry to negotiate and the 'real' bad guys are seen as three dimentional characters. The film does contain the staple set pieces seen in all the Dirty Harry films and they don't disappoint. The scene with the mafia boss is Harry at his best worse depending on your politics. Harry still clashes with his superiors who refer to him as a 'dinosaur' but in this one Harry is more like a private detective and the cops don't show up at the last minute as per usual.'Sudden Impact' is a worthy addition to the Dirty Harry cannon and Roger Moore era Bond gags aside The comedy dog particularly this film spiced up Harry when I questioned the future of the franchise at the end of part three. This is not to say that they should have gone on to part five they shouldn't have. Ideally this would have been released in the seventies with say Cybil Shepherd or Ellyn Burnstein in the main female role as for me Sondra Lock doesn't quite cut it. It's nice to see Albert Popwell again too see it just don't go any further than this 1983 Harry adventure.610 35".

	schema:headline " lacking in some ways and stronger in others it's a good if mixed Eastwood bag";
	schema:reviewBody "It's a strange thing to see a film where some scenes work rather weakly if only in comparison to other films in its legacy and others in a 'subplot' or supporting story are surprisingly provocative and strong. Sudden Impact is one of those cases where Clint Eastwood as starproducerdirector shows when he can be at his best or at his lessor of times when dealing with a crimemysterydetective story in his Dirty Harry fame.

	schema:reviewBody "Clint Eastwood would star again as the battleweary Detective Harry Callahan but would also direct the fourth entry in the 'Dirty Harry' series. 'Sudden Impact' again like the other additions brings its own distinguishable style and tone but if anything it's probably the most similar to the original in it's darker and seedy moments and bestowing a classic line Go ahead. Make my day but some of its humor has to been seen to believe. A bulldog named meathead that pisses and farts. Oh yeah. However an interesting fact this entry was only one in series to not have it set entirely in San Francisco.The story follows that of detective Callahan trying to put the pieces together of a murder where the victim was shot in the groin and then between the eyes. After getting in some trouble with office superiors and causing a stir which has some crime lord thugs after his blood. He's ordered to take leave but it falls into a working one where he heads to a coastal town San Paulo where a murder has occurred similar in vein bullet to groin and between eyes to his case. There he begins to dig up dirt which leads to the idea of someone looking for revenge.To be honest I wasn't all that crash hot on Eastwood's take but after many repeat viewings it virtually has grown on me to the point of probably being on par with the first sequel 'Magnum Force'. This wellassembled plot actually gives Eastwood another angle to work upon even though it feels more like a sophisticated take on the vigilante features running rampant at that time quite literal with something punishing but luridly damaging. It's like he's experimenting with noirthriller touches with characterdriven traits to help develop the emotionally bubbling and eventual morality framework. His use of images is lasting due to its slickly foreboding atmospherics. Dark tones brooding lighting like the scene towards the end akin to some western showdown of a silhouette figure Harry with his new .44 automag handgun moving its way towards the stunned prey on the fishing docks. It's a striking sight that builds fear! Mixing the hauntingly cold with plain brutality and dash of humor. It seemed to come off. A major plus with these films are the dialogues while I wouldn't call 'Sudden Impact' firstrate it provides ample biting exchanges and memorably creditable lines You're a legend in your own mind. Don't you just love hearing Harry sparking an amusing quip before pulling out his piece. The beating action when it occurs is excitingly jarring and intense the only way to go and the pacing flies by with little in the way of flat passages. Lalo Schfrin would return as composer after 'The Enforcer had Jerry Fielding scoring bringing a methodical funky kick which still breathed those gloomy cues to a texturally breezy score that clicked from the getgo. Bruce Surtees an Eastwood regular gets the job behind the camera where he did a piecing job with 'Dirty Harry' and gives the film plenty of scope by wonderfully framing the backdrops in some impeccable tracking scenes but also instrument edgy angles within those dramatic moments.Eastwood as the dinosaur Callahan still packs a punch going beyond just that steely glare to get the job done and probably showing a little more heart than one would expect from a younger Callahan. This going by the sudden shift in a plot turn of Harry's quest for justice by the badge even though he doesn't always agree with it. I just found it odd a real change of heart. Across from him is a stupendous performance by his beau at the time Sondra Locke. Her turn of traumatic torment being senselessly raped along with her younger sister is hidden by a glassily quiet intensity. When the anger is released it's tactically accurate in its outcome. Paul Drake is perfectly menacing and filthy as one of the targeted thugs and Audrie J. Neenan nails down a repellently scummy and bigmouthed performance. These people are truly an ugly bunch of saps. Pat Hingle is sturdy as the Chief of the small coastal town. In smaller parts are Bradford Dillman and the agreeably potent Albert Popwell a regular in the series 14 but under different characters. How can you forget him in 'Dirty Harry' yes he is bank robber that's at the end of the trademark quote Do I feel lucky? Well do ya punk?".

	schema:reviewBody "This Dirty Harry installment was a bit different than the other four in the series and I can tell you why. It is different because it does not focus mainly on the dirty one' but instead focuses on him and the character of the killer which is portrayed by Sondra Locke. This and the fact that there isn't as much chasing going on as in the rest of the Dirty Harry films make this installment somewhat less exciting than the other ones. However this film does have a bonus it's three predecessors did not have a good editor. The few chasing scenes there are in this film are photographed and edited in style and with ability making the film a pretty tight package if one looks at the directional skills involved.Now the fact that this film isn't too exciting does not mean that it has a low quality. It is just this episode of Dirty Harry does not focus on action and Harry bringing bad guys to justice. This film which is not as much aimed to be a crime flick as the other four Harry films is supposed to tell a story and is aimed at giving Harry more depth. In that it succeeds but that doesn't make this good either. The bottom line is that this film is watchable and that it does feature some of Harry's or should I say Eastwood's? famous oneliners but that in it's core it is not a typical Dirty Harry film. For me The Enforcer was the best in the series with The Dead Pool and The Enforcer sharing the second place. So if I was you which I am NOT I'd start with those ones. If you don't like those you probably won't like a single Dirty Harry film.6 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Sudden Impact like all of the Dirty Harry movies starring Clint Eastwood has some subtle messages about a lackluster American justice system with only a handful of people some with a badge and some not willing to stick their necks out in order to see the right thing done. That has always been the communiqu ducking beneath the insistent gunfire slashing and explosions that make up the bulk of these pictures. My problem with Sudden Impact apart from having been mostly bored by the film was that it left me with these two very different realizations in a Dirty Harry film the hero should remain in San Francisco Mr. Eastwood should remain in front of the camera.This film the only one which Mr. Eastwood directed as well as starred in is by far the weakest. It is truly surprising since it does start out very well. Of course that's when the movie is still set in San Francisco. It is here that we get the Dirty Harry material that we look for. Early on a punk arrested by Mr. Eastwood is let off scotfree by the courts. He gives the inspector a snide remark Dirty Harry grabs him by the collar berates him and slams him against the elevator wall. Classic. More so is the famous diner sequence and the movie's signature line.But shortly after this point Dirty Harry takes a trip to San Paulo tracking yet another serial killerone whose M.O. is shooting her victim once in the head and once in the genitalsand the movie goes completely downhill. It is no longer exciting or very funny. Instead Sudden Impact becomes pretentious depressing and extremely ponderous. It's a movie in no hurry to see itself end I only wish I could have felt the same.A core problem is the lack of a commanding villainess. As in the original Dirty Harry from 1971 we see the murderer in a closeup at the very beginning so there is no mystery for the audience to piece together. The difference is this the psychotic sharpshooter from the original Dirty Harry was a disgusting and utterly repulsive creep. As played by Sondra Locke in this film the rape victim taking her revenge on the men who molested her and her nowvegetative sister is uninteresting. And what the screenplay has to offer Miss Locke is not a whole heck of a lot better. It utilizes the tiresome gimmick of flashbacks intercut with the killer executing her victims. The shooting parts are effectively handled but the clumsy flashbacks trivialize them. Furthermore the movie does not set itself a mind in how to portray Miss Locke empathetic victim or scumbag. I think the movie was leaning more toward the former but I kept on feeling disgust for her. Almost as much as I had for the snarling little twerps she was preying upon.To make matters worse Miss Locke is really the center focus of the story. She's almost the real star of the movie. Mr. Eastwood's Dirty Harry really plays secondfiddle. The movie chugs along with some lousy moments where they confront each other including an alltime low for the series where they share a bed for the night. At that point in the film I threw my hands in the air ready to give up.As the man standing behind the camera Clint Eastwood disappoints this time around. He has demonstrated before and since Sudden Impact that he is a very capable director. The problem here is that he seems to have favored tossing out his own flair in exchange for imitating the men who directed him before. With the exception of the San Francisco scenesyes they are really the best part of the movie. I cannot emphasize that enoughwe do not see his director's personae in the images. It does not feel like a Clint Eastwood film it feels like a secondrate imitation of a Don Siegel film or a Ted Post film. I wish Mr. Eastwood had either trusted his instincts or allowed another director to handle the material. Maybe he did learn the lesson as Buddy Van Horn directed the fifth and better entry in the series The Dead Pool.Just as surprising as the overall boredom of the film was the insulting sting of its ending an ending that I cannot imagine the Dirty Harry Callahan of the previous three movies in the franchise would have allowed to be. Here the movie's subtle message about justice and doing the right thing contradicts itself and it left me feeling disturbed and unclean. Sudden Impact is about as joylessly depressing and clumsy as its nighttime cinematography. Dirty Harry has surrounded himself with nobody interesting. His semipartner in the film Albert Popwell finally given a goodguy role in the franchise is underwritten and Mr. Eastwood's most frequent companion is a flatulent bulldog. The humor is not very humorous. The action is not very exciting. The film is surprisingly dull.".

Eastwood's leisurely directing style a perfect match for more thoughtful material Unforgiven Mystic River is not at all suitable here.  Sondra Locke is just boring.

The action scenes were essential to the exposition.  And the pistol shots had acquired a new fullthroated booming sound that has since become standard.  Eastwood even tried to act  a little.  His throwaway laugh after clicking his empty hammer at the robber after the first shoot out was the only laugh I can ever remember from Eastwood that seemed to register real amusement.  They all should have quit while they were ahead. Sondra Locke is really quite beautiful although obviously no longer the sensitive teenager of her earliest movies mature now and dumbly fatalistic having been ravished or ravaged by a gang of hoodlums under the boardwalk at Santa Cruz.  Most of the film is shot in Santa Cruz called San Paulo a curious fictive mixture of Spanish andor Portugese andor Italian.  Let's call it a generically Romance language name for a town although of course it fits none of the known ones.  Its location is also curious north of the City making a hash of the geography but never mind. Harry's in trouble with the SFPD.  Yet again.  They ship him to San Paulo where he finds himself willy nilly on the trail of Sondra Locke who is assiduously knocking off all the people involved in her rape years ago.  His butting in annoys Pat Hingle the local sherrif.  The four or five participants in the rape are still sleazebags and deserve being shot in the cojones.  Except one of them is apparently a dyke who was only an enthusiastic witness.  No matter she gets blown away anyhow.  One of the guys caught by Locke in a garage seems to have become pathetically middle class.  In a weak and genuinely remorseful voice he apologizes to her and begs for mercy.  He gets it in the cojones too.  Harry has changed his pistol in this one.  He couldn't get a bigger pistol because there aren't any to speak of short of something that would need mounting on a Bradley Fighting Vehicle.  So while it's still .44 mag it is now automatic.  So what?  Harry pops up out of garbage cans to shoot guys in the back.  Pretty funny eh?  There's an ugly dog in it too given to the release of intestinal gas.  Clint gets a lot of mileage out of dogs and children.  It's not really worth going on about this movie.  If one had to sum it up in a single word terrible would come close to getting the job done.  Do yourself a favor.  Watch Dirty Harry again or something.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the moment it opens showcasing a nocturnal San Francisco skyline through a magnificent aerial point of view I knew I would be disappointed with the fourth film in the Dirty Harry franchise. Full disclosure The first Dirty Harry film is one of my personal favorites. I consider it a masterpiece from every shot line of dialogue and musical cue. And it's the musical score in Sudden Impact that first led me astray. With its tacky 80s sound the music during the opening credits made me realize how much I missed the proto acidjazz sounds of the first film. I was shocked to discover that it was the same man Lalo Schifrin who did great music for another San Francisco cop drama Bullitt who did the music for both films. I should also add that this is the only Dirty Harry sequel that I have seen and after watching this one I'm in no hurry to pursue the others in an effort to keep my love for the original alive.Sudden Impact features an older and grumpier Inspector Harry Callahan still serving his swift brand of justice on the mean streets of the city by the bay. After giving an aging mobster a heart attack a cameo from The Godfather Part II's Michael V. Gazzo Callahan finds himself constantly in the line of fire. People have a nasty habit of getting dead around you a superior officer tells him. To lose the heat Eastwood is soon sent to a small coastal town to get background information on a previous homicide investigation he was working on in the city. Right as he rolls into town Callahan proves his bosses' statement correct by driving past a robbery in progress in this sleepy little town.It was at this moment that I completely gave up on the film. It's simply filled with way too many overthetop moments and a corny sense of humor which don't bode well with its main storyline of a rape victim taking revenge on her perpetrators years later. Because of these two opposing moods the film feels like it takes forever to get started derailed by one action scene too many. I wasn't surprised to learn after the fact that the film was originally conceived as a vehicle for Eastwood's then girlfriend and collaborator Sondra Locke and was only modeled into a Dirty Harry film after Warner Brothers responded to a fan poll that expressed interest in bringing back the series. If it were cut by about twenty minutes the movie might be considerably better.Sudden Impact's only contribution to cinema is the famous line Go ahead ... make my day delivered by Eastwood near the start of the film when confronting a robber holding a waitress hostage. The scene is familiar but it doesn't undermine the power of Eastwood's delivery an iconic moment in an otherwise dull film. The line is delivered again during the film's climax to a similar effect. In fact the whole climatic showdown and final set piece are very well done and almost redeem all that has come before it. However the impact is tainted after wasting so much time on previous shenanigans and off the wall coincidences.".

	schema:reviewBody "RAMPAGE AT APACHE WELLS played theatrically in the US and used to get a lot of TV play as late as 1991. Its popularity is not hard to understand. Like all of the Germanmade westerns from the winnetou cycle based on the literary works of Karl May this one from his novel The Oil Prince which IS available in an inprint English translation for those so inclined this is wellmounted beautifully photographed beautifully scored and wellacted. As I remember Lex Barker made SIX films in the role of Old Shatterhand Stewart Granger made two in the role of Old Surehand and Rod Cameron made one in the role of Old Firehand and I have not seen the latter.... As rugged and manly as Barker was Granger also does well with the role bringing his own unique humor and elegance to the character. If only he had made more of these! One surprising appearance here is Terence Hill under his real name Mario Girotti as a complex notreallyadmirable character who grows throughout the film and sees the error of his ways. Hill plays the snivelling role convincingly and he will be a surprise to those who only know his later heroic and comedy roles. Another interesting aspect of this film more evident in the novels than in most of the films is the details about German immigrants in America. As I live in South Texas I live near some of the German settlements of the 1800s and have learned about the history of Germans in Texas it's interesting to see particularly German qualities in some of the settlers instead of just making them generic Anglo settlers. Of course I don't go to films like this or any film for detailed history but the particularity has a interesting flavor to it. The late Stewart Granger was a man with real star quality with a charm and wit and elegance that is seen in every frame. While he camps it up in some of his European work of the 1960s although always in an entertaining manner! he certainly took the role of Old Surehand seriously. He is a nice mesh with Pierre Brice's warm but stoic interpretation of the Winnetou character. The film also has a full array of colorful supporting characters. Overall while this may not have the depth or philosophical profundity of the finest Italian Westerns it is a satisfying impressively mounted Western that fires on all cylinders and deserves wider fame.".

This is a soso episode about one of the series of popular German made Western  featuring the duo who agree to guide the motley group trough Indian territory  both of them repeat their same notorious roles as dignified as always .

WinnetouPierre Brice repeats  as usual his excellent role to be continued in a TV series . Brice was descendant of old French nobility and considered to be one of the most famous and most loved actors in Germany and in the other countries in Eastern Europe  thanks to this role and starred several pictures as charming Indian Winnetou . He even received First Class Medal as one the most popular Frenchmen in Germany . In 1962 the German producer Horst Wendlandt searched for an actor who should play the Native American chief and got to know Brice at the Berlin Film Festival . He got the role and portrayed Winnetou in ten more movies . Barker scored especially high marks  though he played as a serious and intelligent man who joins forces with Winnetou  while Stewart Granger as Old Surehand performs with humor and joy  he's the perfect counterpoint to Winnetou . Enjoyable relationship between Old Surehand and Winnetou is quite match .

Stewart Granger took the role in two occasions  he starred a diverse character but the role is pretty similar to Old Shatterland  he plays with mirth and sympathetic manner as Among vultures and Winnetou and Surehand . Besides  Rod Cameron starred only one  Old Firehand in which chemistry between stuffy Cameron and Brice is inexistent . Nice support cast such as the customary nasty Harald Leipnitz along with the Morocco woman  Macha Mril  Walter Barnes and  Terence Hill ! prior his amusing films with Bud Spencer playing as Trinidad and Bambino . In fact  Terence married an American girl of Bavarian descent  and learning German language  he starred several Germanic films  before his successful Italian ones . The film displays a colorful cinematography and a catching  sensitive musical score though with excessive use of synthesizer by Martin Bottcher  series's ordinary  being eventually replaced in some episode by Peter Thomas . The motion picture Rampage at Apache Wells or Der Olprinz by Harald Philipp was well produced by Rialto Film PrebenPhilipseHorst Wendlandt Constantin . The flick was professionally directed by Harald Philipp who made all kind of genres  action  Western  Wartime  besides he was a German thriller expert called Krimi Edward Wallace adaptation and realized another Western titled  Winnetou and the Crossbreed .

	schema:reviewBody "A later entry in the socalled due to being Germanmade Kraut Western series of Karl May novelsturnedfilms this one doesn't quite measure up to some of the others but does have a few things to recommend it. Granger takes on a role very similar to one that Lex Barker had portrayed in prior films that of a buckskinclad adventurer frequently joined by his trusted Indian friend Brice. Here they must aid a wagon train of settlers who are being misled and mistreated by a greedy oil baron Leipnitz who wishes to lay claim to the land they are heading towards. Leipnitz sticks them with an impostor for a scout plays a spy Hill in their midst and then turns the Indians led by PopovicMavid against them. Granger is solid though he brings a more effete quality to the series than rugged macho Barker did something not aided by his flouncy scarf. Brice is one step away from being unintentionally funny with stoic demeanor sudden appearances and his pigeon English. In one scene he says Surely my friend and one almost waits for Granger to say Stop calling me Shirley! in response. He also has an awfully haphazard moment or two performing an otherwise surprisingly thrilling rescue on a raging river. Leipnitz has a terrific look all clad in black leather and with a neatly trimmed beard. His villainy adds to the film. Hill is handsome and decent but doesn't get the amount of screen time or showcasing he would command a few years later. Weissgerber is a middleaged pioneer woman while Meril is a young lady falling for Hill. Both women are okay but can't help but pale next to previous ladies in the series such as Elke Sommer Daliah Lavi and Karin Dor. There is some atrocious and annoying comic relief with Weissgerber's brother a meek cowardly composer of operas and Srdoc a 48 yearold is ineffectively cast as a crotchety and decrepit old man. As in most of these films the bulk of the dubbing is laughably bad with many of the characters sounding like grizzled growlyvoiced cowpokes no matter what they look like. Still there are things to enjoy here. The scenery though not that of the western U.S.  tulips pop up in one scene! is stunning. There are some great shots of a rushing river and waterfall. Unusual approaches to action and mayhem are present for example there is a mute assassin called Knife for obvious reasons and a general difference in tone from the standard western films which are being emulated. It doesn't always work but it's usually entertaining on a modest level. Sadly the title rampage is cut short rather quickly making for a somewhat anticlimactic denouement. The best of the Karl May filmizations is The Treasure of Silver Lake.".

	schema:reviewBody "Der lprinz or The Oil Prince is a West German  Yugoslavian coproduction from 1965 so this 90minute movie had its 50th anniversary last year. Once again it stars Pierre Brice as the title character and Stewart Granger is on board too playing Old Surehand with Lex Barker and the recently deceased Gtz George not in it this time. But there are familiar faces from other Karl May adaptations such as Terence Hill and a whole lot of Yugoslavian actors. Overall this film can be summarized pretty nicely that it is hurt by the absence of a not too great actor like Lex Barker. At least he had tons of charisma. Pierre Brice is not a good actor in my opinion and should not have headlined this franchise. The result is that this movie we have here is almost entirely forgettable and lacks in many departments especially storytelling. The director and also one of the two writers who adapted Karl May's work is Harald Philipp and I have seen other work from him that disappointed me. Still I am not sure if it is really his fault or if May is the one too blame as I have never read the base material. The result in this very case is a film that may be beautiful visually at times but is really empty in terms of the story. If you want to see a great oil movie go for There Will be Blood instead.".

Pierre Brice seemed more authentic as an Indian in this film compared to Winnetou and Old Firehand but then again we're talking about a Frenchman portraying an Apache Chief. I saw this picture under the title Rampage at Apache Wells and that's a bit of a misnomer as well. There was one Indian attack that caused some damage but it was over pretty quickly. Try as they might I didn't really get a sense of the blood brother connection between Winnetou and Old Surehand Stewart Granger. In his early fifties Granger didn't look like the rugged Western type to be pulling off a role like this. The plot of the story seemed reasonable enough settlers heading to Shelly Lake are encouraged by a promise of free land from the Utahs in exchange for a share of the grain and meat they intend to produce. When a slick shyster going by the name of The Oil Prince Harald Leipnitz instigates the Indian tribe against the settlers the opposing sides have a falling out until Surehand can expose the outlaw and his henchman Knife Slobodan Dimitrijevic. It all plays out in expected fashion with little in the way of suspense in a cautionary tale that warns me to stay away from Westerns in which the principal players go by the names of Pierre Slobodan Harald and Milan.".

Nafas receives a letter from her sister announcing that she's decided to commit suicide during the final eclipse before the dawn of the 21st century desperate to spare her sister's life Nafas makes haste to Afghanistan where she joins a caravan of refugees who for a variety of reasons are returning to the wartorn nation. As Nafas searches for her sister she soon gets a clear and disturbing portrait of the toll the Taliban regime has taken upon its people.";

	schema:headline " fascinating pseudodocumentary film";
	schema:reviewBody "When you see Kandahar' it's almost impossible to believe that you're watching a film set in the late 20th Century.  Mohsen Makhmalbaf's film takes place in Afghanistan in the latter days of the Taliban regime when women were not merely viewed as second class citizens but were denied any form of education or civil rights and even had to go out in public covered from head to toe to prevent men from seeing their faces.  The filmmaker takes us to the heart of this alien and frightening world and makes us see perhaps for the first time on the big screen just how horrific life was for women in that time and place.Kandahar' is less a narrative film than a series of fascinating vignettes that drive home the realities of life in that part of the world.  What plot there is involves the efforts of a female Canadian journalist to sneak back into her native country to prevent her desperate sister in Kandahar from committing suicide at the next solar eclipse.  But that is really just a string on which to hang the individual pearls that make up the film.  What is of primary interest to both the filmmaker and the audience are the various people the journalist encounters and the many experiences she undergoes.  Hidden beneath her own burka she witnesses firsthand the devastating poverty the utter degradation and dehumanization of women and the authoritarian oppression that defined life in that country during the Taliban rule.  Along the way she meets an American doctor who is trying his hardest to in some way relieve the misery of these people but who finds himself waging a losing battle against the primitivism and theocratic oppression that have made life a living hell for the common citizenry of the country.  She also encounters a seemingly endless group of people who have become dismembered by all the land mines left over from the Afghani war with the Russians.  There is one remarkable scene wherein hordes of desperate onelegged men hobble on crutches across the desert as Red Cross helicopters rain prosthetic limbs down onto the sands below.  It is merely one among many images from the film that seer themselves into the viewer's memory. Another is a scene in which a male doctor has to examine his female patients through a hole cut out of a sheet not even being allowed to talk to the woman directly about her symptoms but having to get his information through a male or female child interpreter.'  Makhmalbaf keeps the ending of the film deliberately ambiguous which might frustrate some viewers but which actually adds to the verisimilitude of the piece.  In the same way much of the acting in the film borders on the amateurish at times but again that contributes to the pseudodocumentary aura that the film must have to be truly effective.  A clearcut narrative resolution and slick performances by obviously professional actors would likely rob the film of its muchneeded sense of immediacy.Kandahar' by providing a voice to so many voiceless people is a film that cries out to be seen.".

He is also a standin within the film for Makhmalbaf himself who started as an Islamic fundamentalist revolutionary but has moved towards a more openminded humanism.The film itself describes a circle the first scene is also the last the sun shining through a burqa onto a woman's face.

We make criticise say the Taliban regime in Afghanistan for forcing women to wear the burka but our own society enforces different standards with regard to the male and female exposure of the chest.  We might therefore say that the burka is oppressive not so much in itself but rather as part of a system that undermines the freedom of women but this is to assume that in our sexist and oversexualised society women are in practice freer.  In fact I believe they are but at some level it is important to acknowledge the arbitrariness of such positions at the deepest level that they depend on prejudice to use that word nonprejudicially on values rather than reason.  To argue that because we know nothing for certain we should therefore do nothing think nothing is a doctrine of futile despair but to be aware of the limitations of our own thinking to know that for certain future generations will surely condemn us are clearly as we condemn others is vital before we consider the values of societies other than our own a secular equivalent of humility before God.This is not to say I would like to see a film defending the appalling Taliban.  But even the most tyrannical regime is in some regards the product of the society it tyrannises we are all both prisoners and guards.  To understand that regime and its true horrors one needs to understand how it worked with as well as against the grain of traditional society and what is good as well as what is bad about that. Unfortunately this is not what we get with 'Kandahar'.It's a shame because this film contains the potential material for exploring the ambiguity of life.  Its central character is rude arrogant and ambitious a journalist travelling to Afghanistan to try and save her sister she doesn't hesitate to try to try and make a story out of her ordeal at the same time.  A returning exile she might be considered as both having the right to criticise what is happening to her country and also the eyes of one who has seen enough to know what is wrong.  But one could just as easily say that she has neither that in fact she has the rights to neither position.  There is thus the  potential to portray her with great ambivalence but 'Kandahar' prefers the values of propaganda.  So instead she is our witness our seer and our reliable narrator and the film is all the weaker for it.'Kandahar' contains some great footage of a bleak but beautiful country but at times its limited budget shows.  The dialgoue is strange the second most important character is bizarrely an American and a number of the scenes sit uneasily between documentary and fiction Michael Winterbottom did something similar in 'In This World' but that film was more convincing because the agenda of the director was less clumsily imposed on every scene. 'Kandahar' has neither documentary truth or dramatic ambiguity and seems to view the world with a very Western slant.  Perhaps evil is like Schroedinger's cat something that can be labelled or shown but not both at the same time.  'Kandahar' prefers to label but I prefer more subtlety in my films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nafas is an Afghan refugee in Canada separated from what remains of her family. When she receives a letter from her sister in Kandahar saying that she intends to kill herself at the next eclipse Nafas sets out to enter Afghanistan and find her sister in order to rescue her. Joining a family traveling across the desert she quickly remembers why she fled the country in the first place as her status as a woman is as dangerous as the unseen landmines as she tries to find her sister before time runs out.I knew little about this film prior to watching it apart from that it was popular mostly due to its unfortunate relevance. Watching it from the start to the end I must admit that as a film or a story it was not as good as some viewers have said. The narrative is simplistic and seems to alter the passing of time to suit itself while major holes in plotting are rather annoying if that is what you are focusing on. The film also struggles in terms of characters with Nafas being rather bland and hard to care for her sister being unseen and not in any more danger than those we do see ie minimising our passion for the quest and even the noble Talib Sahid came across as rather an unlikely character to stumble upon.However I still consider this to be a film worth seeing even after all that. Why? Well simply because of the view it gives us of Afghanistan  a view that not even the British media did a good job of giving us when the conflict started. I watched this thinking 'this is the country we have been bombing for several years now?' and while I knew it was hardly the most technologically advanced country it doesn't really hit home until you see it and with US news coverage of this side of the country being limited to hypedup soldiers then this film should be seen to help balance it all out. So Nafas' journey is little more than an excuse to show many aspects of the country within a sort of story and as that it is worth seeing  it is hard not to feel for the people as you see the treatment of women the poor facilities the horrors of landmines and so on.True to the weakness of the plot the ending just sort of 'happens' and those who had been holding to the hope of the vague narrative becoming stronger will also be let down. This is not a film to come to for a story or a strong plot because in these areas it is pretty weak and not very good as a film as you'd expect one to be. However it provides insight into a country that we have all heard a lot about over the past few years and for that and that alone it is valuable and worth seeing if you can get the chance.".

The second was the surreal parachuting prosthetic legs and the third was the series of family portraits taken of refugees before they returned home.I was disappointed that this was such a western feeling film.  It shocks me that the heroine was interested not in preserving her homeland or even restoring it.  Her goal was merely to save her friend and leave.  She did so by flashing wads of US dollars and expecting the locals to jump at the chance to get money.  She even expected the refugee father to stick with her and protect her instead of his family because she had paid him.  None of the indigenous people had any agency at all and there was no remorse demonstrated about this truth.In the filmmaker's defense I cannot imagine any distribution contract coming for a movie which does the things I am seeking but that was my hope nevertheless.If you see it see it for the occasional stirring image but don't expect plot dialog or character development.".

The sister is so depressed that she has  decided to kill herself on the occasion of an upcoming solar eclipse.  Nafas decides she must go to Kandahar to find her sister and somehow  get her out before it is too late.  After flying to Iran she crosses the border by land into Afghanistan  and is immediately faced with the rigors of life under the Taliban. Her  annoyance at having to purchase and wear a burka at all times fortells  the trying experience she is about to have. Going from one misadventure  to another it is a descent into an absurd hell.  The story is compelling the photography starkly beautiful and the  acting so real that one has the impression of watching a documentary. I  would say it is Survivor meets the Taliban but Survivor is ultimately  about selfishness whereas the protagonist is a paragon of devotion to  her sister.  The film is based on a true story except it involved two friends  rather than sisters and was filmed in Iran near the Afghan border  before the events of 911. I would so much like to see a sequel showing  further changes in Afghan society after the overthrow of the Taliban  and several years of rebuilding under the Westernbacked Karzai  government.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a sad statement on America's worldview that it took a horrible tragedy on Sept. 11 2001 to awaken Americans to the brutality of the Taliban in Afghanistan. Until then most Americans didn't care about the vicious and ruthless nature of those who governed that country.Former President Bill Clinton said his one regret during his presidency was that he did nothing while nearly one million people were slaughtered in Rwanda. True. But he should also consider why the U.S. this beacon of democracy did nothing while the Taliban mistreated women and massacred Afghanis. Even George W. Bush gave the Taliban nary a thought until that horrific day in 2001.When it was initially released Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf's film Kandahar probably had little chance of finding an audience in the U.S. After all at the time the majority of Americans wouldn't have been able to find Afghanistan on a map let alone know where Kandahar was. But then Sept. 11 happened and Kandahar like Kabul and Spin Boldak became household words in American homes. U.S. TV networks rushed out experts on Afghanistan and reported on the Taliban's brutality as if they'd uncovered a previously unknown fact.Of course all that's changed now. We don't care about Afghanistan anymore. Not after this administration concocted evidence and launched an unjust war against Iraq gaining support for it by frightening Americans. Paranoia is patriotic. Also covering the downfall of a barbaric regime that didn't put up a fight isn't as sexy as giving roundtheclock coverage on a pop star accused of child molestation or a yet another rich young white woman gone missing in California. Watching Kandahar you'll no doubt wonder why we didn't intervene years ago. If this film doesn't make Americans truly appreciate their lives and rights which they take for granted nothing will.The film's inspired by true events. Writer and star Nelofer Pazira who fled Kabul with her family tried to enter Talibanruled Afghanistan to search for her best friend who stayed behind. Pazira never got beyond the IranianAfghan border. But filmmaker Makhmalbaf whom Pazira had contacted earlier decided two years later to fictionalize Pazira's story.I admit I was in two minds after watching Kandahar. The acting's amateurish  they're all nonactors  and the storytelling is at times a bit heavyhanded. I don't know whether it was a good idea to cast Pazira. Her character carries the entire film and it needs someone who can pulls us into her plight. Pazira's narration occasionally gets ponderous. The film relies heavily on that narration to serve as exposition a good example of tell don't show when films should be otherwise. Pazira never varies her voice and her monotone can be offputting. A stronger actress could have done wonders with the role.However these flaws could be ignored because of what the film's trying to tell us. Maybe we're too spoiled by professionallooking Hollywood films to appreciate something like this. The film's beautifully shot and contains several wrenching moments. I shan't spoil it for you but there's an unforgettably potent moment in a Red Cross camp.Kandahar makes a good double feature with Siddiq Barmak's Osama 2003. Also do yourself a great favor  read Khaled Hosseini's powerful novel The Kite Runner a film adaptation of which will be directed by Sam Mendes.Kandahar proves great nations should help oppressed people even if the assistance doesn't fall into the narrow category of national interest. That would be an acceptable reason than scaring an uninformed populace with fake evidence about nonexistent WMDs. Kandahar might not look polished the acting not brilliant. But I'll take this film any day over huge glossy Hollywood clunkers  Be Cool and Hostage for instance  showing in theaters right now.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kandahar or Safar e Ghandehar is a film that tells about a journey towards Kandahar the second largest city of Afghanistan undertaken by Nafas a young female journalist who escaped Afghanistan with her family but must return and race against time in an attempt to rescue her sister. Nafas an Afghani refugee who fled to Canada when the Taliban came to power receives word in 1999 that her sister will commit suicide at the last solar eclipse of the millennium due to unbearable conditions under the Taliban both as a woman and as a casualty of a landmine. As the film proceeds Nafas learns more and more about the hardships women face under the Taliban and even more so how years of war have destroyed Afghan society. The film is inspired by the reallife experience of actress Nelofer Pazira who plays Nafas. In 1989 she fled her homeland of Afghanistan and later received a similar letter not from a sister but from a longtime friend who wanted to end her life in a similar situation starting her trek from the IranAfghanistan border Nafas disguises herself as the fourth wife of an elderly Afghan man. As Nafas' desperation grows she has only three days to reach Kandahar before her sister kills herself on the day of the last solar eclipse of the century the images grow more and more dreamlike. At one point Nafas encounters a madrasah where boys with AK47 rifles intone verses from their holy book as a bearded mullah looks on. Later with the help of an Englishspeaking African American doctor she wanders into a Red Cross relief center for mine victims. Nafas's guide hidden behind a false beard points out to her that the only technological progress allowed in the country is weaponry. One healthy man named Sahid continually begs the nurses to let him have a set of legs for his mother  legs he will no doubt sell on the black market. The doctor guide persuades Sahid who finally gets a pair of artificial legs to accompany Nafas in her journey until they run into a wedding party traveling into Kandahar. Nafas attempts to fit in with the party but the end of the road is unfortunately near for her. Dressed in burkas the pair joins a wedding party which is stopped by the Taliban because they are playing musical instruments and singingforbidden by Afghan law. Her guide is taken away and she is unveiled.Makhmalbaf ominously concludes by showing us Nafas' point of view as she lowers her burkhaliterally and powerfully drawing a veil over her fate. Captured she seems destined to fall into the same kind of life that she hoped to help her sister escape. Interestingly the film begins and ends with that brilliant shot of lowering of the burkha by Nafas perhaps reminding us of the famous couplet And the end of all our exploringWill be to arrive where we started. This shot of the movie a solar eclipse as seen through the burka's mesh and its blinding effects seem to have irradiated the heroine into a kind of waking stupor. Nafas' journey is long and rambling and may have only taken place in her head. But as the movie's director Mohsen Makhmalbaf implicitly asks in every scene what is Afghanistan but a state of mind?It is filmed documentarystyle but the plot is heavily scripted. Also the Englishlanguage dialogue suffers from flat delivery. The protagonist seems phony every potentially poignant moment is ruined by her deadpan method of speaking. Visually the film is stunning at times especially when one sees the wedding party march in the desert. The sea of burqas in contrasting colors such as emerald black ochre yellow peach white purple etc. is absolutely stunning. There's even surrealism when prosthetic legs for land mine victims at a Red Cross camp parachute to the groundBut the quality of the cinematography is not enough to rescue the flawed direction. The vast open spaces also allow Makhmalbaf and his outstanding cinematographer Ebrahim Ghafouri to create a steady flow of stunning images accompanied by Mohammad Reza Darvishi's intoxicating yet spare score. . . The plot is not very thoroughly developed. The scenery is beautiful in a stark way and the plot is barely enough to keep a viewer dramatically involved but the point is to learn about life in today's Afghanistan.The Taliban is gone but the sociocultural matrix which gave rise to its existence still flourishes in Afghanistan. It will take a lot more than a few years to heal that wounded countryWriting in The New York TimesA.O.Scott noted that both Kandahar and Abbas Kiarostami's ABC Africaabout Ugandan orphans contain moment of sublime visual poetry that at once heighten and complicate their humanitarian message. Even though it deals directly with neither war nor terrorist violence it is an anti war movie with a difference.".

All we can do is to enjoy the beauty of  this masterpiece  the shots the dialogues and finest sense of humor. 3 days of hope passing through deserts searching to find a reason to live. And here there is certainly.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is not for those brought up on a diet of Hollywood entertaining blockbusters with amazing special effects thrilling and twisting plots character development and a satisfying denouement.Kandahar by an acclaimed Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf carries different layers of meaning conveyed creatively through an artistic process. The image as a language is more powerful than words can ever convey. He uses real people rather than actors to enhance authenticity. AfghaniCanadian Nafas has three days to save her despairing sister from suicide in Kandahar in Talibancontrolled Afghanistan but can't enter it normally because of her journalist credentials. Her only choice is to trek from the Iranian border. Mohsen uses this narrative to capture the horrendous ravages and severe plights of a wartorn country steeped in an oppressive culture for women and shackled by the terrifying ideology of the Taliban. He employs no special effects no physical violence no explosions not a single gunshot not a single drop of blood  just images of everyday life.Nafas can't travel as an unaccompanied woman and she must wear the head to toe burqa covering. For us the burqa is a symbol of the woman's oppression to the Afghani male it's his honor. Women are meant to be largely invisible so poignantly captured in family photo portraits. A doctor can only examine his female patient through a small hole in a curtain separating the two and communicate indirectly via a third party such as an accompanying child. Girls are removed from schools en masse. For a woman living under full cover hope is for a day she'll be seen.The austere landscape reinforces the grinding poverty and the meager means of existence inevitably giving rise to lawlessness and a survival instinct that grabs every opportunity for financial gain. And there is little chance of escaping this hopelessness as the only aspiration for a boy is to be a mullah a religious figure through meaningless rote memorization of the Koran evidenced by repetitions of a mantra venerating the only technology allowed  the AK47 rifle.The most chilling indictment of the war is the hordes of people with missing limbs blown up by land mines which litter the entire country. The most important currency for these people is the prosthetic limb for which they are entitled only one per year. Everyone including the ablebodied needs a pair just in case. The surrealism of a horde of guys racing on crutches to receive crude prosthetic limbs parachuting down from the sky sears the mind.The large bridal party adorned in their fluttering multicolored burqas supposedly covering only women trudging across the barren landscape in rhythm to a numbing chant and tribal drumbeat heading towards a wedding in Kandahar conveys a notion of traditional bliss and innocence. That vanishes like a mirage when the party is intercepted at a Taliban checkpoint. The curious presence of an African American looking for God but ends up as a doctor administering whatever relief he can to basic health issues is a statement that the core problem in Afghanistan is not religion per se but a dysfunctional country in a state of crippling deprivation of everything.This movie was released in 2001 a decade after Taliban forces aided and abetted by the United Sates defeated the might of the then Soviet Union in their misguided and disastrous attempt to invade Afghanistan. This left the shattered country at the mercy of the extremist ideologically driven Taliban. The United States' response to 911 was to invoke a war against terror targeting the same Taliban forces. More bombs and military destruction followed. The country has once again been plunged into unimaginably crippling devastation.The overarching message of this movie is the carnage and utter futility of war in bringing about desired social outcomes. It would appear Americans have neither learned the lessons of the Vietnam War nor from the Soviet's recent experience. Bombs and other military hardware are useless against an enemy with neither significant infrastructure nor targets to be destroyed. Deploying highly equipped alien boots on the ground is not going to win the hearts and minds of a population devoid of the means of livelihood scarred by decades of war and lacking the education to escape this quagmire. The entire country becomes an even more fertile ground for breeding and recruiting terrorists  the antithesis of the war's objective. The American effort in Afghanistan is reputed to cost 1 billion each day. Imagine this amount redirected into developing and educating the country instead.Makhmalbaf makes a pointed reference to the total uselessness of the UN. Its flag being a symbol of neutrality that was meant to protect the traveling party ended up planted next to a human skeleton in the desert. The only thing of tokenistic value recovered from the skeleton was a bejeweled ring which ended up being worthless.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the novel by Roger Lemelin written in 1948. Les Plouffe tells the story of a roman catholic french Canadian family from Quebec city circa 1930 to 1945. It was adapted as a long running live television series from 1953 to 1959 under the title La Famille Plouffe on the french Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Radio Canada network. In 1980 film maker Gilles Carle set out to make a feature length motion picture with producers husband and wife Justine and Denis Heroux and John Kemeny. As many of those tax credit deals worked they needed a signed broadcast deal to get the financing together and Radio Canada stepped. The film was released in 1981 to great acclaim and a longer two part version was later broadcast on CBC television and on Radio Canada television.While the longer version has more depth of character and takes its time to give further context to its action the theatrical film moves along and has the virtue of being punchier and more energetic. It is a populist story that shows the social and political context of french Canada between the wars very well. We see the shackles of the Catholic Church and the growing strain the population felt under its restrictions. We see the sentiment in French Canada against the British monarchy and the fear of conscription in the upcoming war. We are shown the unrelieved poverty many french Canadian families lived in during the depression. All four of the Plouffe children live with their parents and work to contribute to the family earnings. Each in his or her own way yearns to get out on their own.Following the success of Les Plouffe Lemelin wrote a sequel book under the title Le Crime d'Ovide Plouffe which became an immediate best seller in Quebec. It was quickly adapted into a two part television miniseries directed by Denis Arcand of The Decline Of The American Empire fame.The DVD for Les Plouffe would have to wait for release until the 21st century.".

	schema:headline " Lots of StopMotion Fun!";
	schema:reviewBody "Fans of Ray Harryhausen's stop motion animation process will have a field day with JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS which Harryhausen considered his best work. And certainly Harryhausen's special effects are the highlight of this film which is generally based on the ancient Greek myth of Jason's search for the golden fleece.The film as a whole is very much like a superior swordandsandal epic of the 1950s and 1960s very colorful and overrun with manly men and beautiful dancing girls. A bit slow to start once the story line is established the pace leaps forwardand we are treated to some of Harryhausen's most enjoyable creations including Talos the bronze statue two of the most evil looking harpies you can imagine a really nasty hydra and Harryhausen's most famous and his own personal favorite bit of work an attack by skeleton warriors.In the wake of computer generated graphics Harryhausen's work may strike some as dated but this is actually part of its charm for we will never see its like on screen again it has a certain visual appeal not found in contemporary films and Harryhausen's creations always have remarkable personality. On the downside however some of the film's other techniques have not aged as well and the use of rearview projection is extremely noticeable and often annoying to the modern eye. Still even those who aren't overly enthusiastic about these types of special effects will find the film an excellent choice as a family night film. As for Harryhausen fansthe film is a mustsee mustown and mustwatch as often as possible! Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

	onyx:emotionText "Fans of Ray Harryhausen's stop motion animation process will have a field day with JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS which Harryhausen considered his best work. And certainly Harryhausen's special effects are the highlight of this film which is generally based on the ancient Greek myth of Jason's search for the golden fleece.The film as a whole is very much like a superior swordandsandal epic of the 1950s and 1960s very colorful and overrun with manly men and beautiful dancing girls. A bit slow to start once the story line is established the pace leaps forwardand we are treated to some of Harryhausen's most enjoyable creations including Talos the bronze statue two of the most evil looking harpies you can imagine a really nasty hydra and Harryhausen's most famous and his own personal favorite bit of work an attack by skeleton warriors.In the wake of computer generated graphics Harryhausen's work may strike some as dated but this is actually part of its charm for we will never see its like on screen again it has a certain visual appeal not found in contemporary films and Harryhausen's creations always have remarkable personality. On the downside however some of the film's other techniques have not aged as well and the use of rearview projection is extremely noticeable and often annoying to the modern eye. Still even those who aren't overly enthusiastic about these types of special effects will find the film an excellent choice as a family night film. As for Harryhausen fansthe film is a mustsee mustown and mustwatch as often as possible! Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer";

Besides the frenetic battle with the skeletons and the seemingly hopeless fight against the statue of Talos? I like the way the people are presented I suppose...Heracles is presented not as a young ripped body builder but as one would expect a middleaged strong man to be Formidable a little grey and a little swaggering. Argos the ship builder is tan and fat as one would expect the veteran of many sea voyages to be. The crew looks like what one would expect a crew of ancient greeks to look like.The acting is not spectacular but sincere. No one looks embarrassed to be in this movie. It is tight with great special effects...wonderful for children...And I must mention Hera normally portrayed as a matronly and vindictive woman is here presented as a beautiful and helpful goddess by Honor Blackman no less. Although many of you may be more familiar with her as Pussy Galore from Goldfinger...".

The stopmotion scene's created by special effects pioneer Ray Harryhausen is simply brilliant and makes this movie one of the most influential and important one's when it comes to special effects.

Yes of course the effects all look out dated now but they still surprisingly look convincing enough and at times they are even still simply breathtaking and spectacular to look at. Especially of course the legendary fantastic end fight against the skeleton warriors.The story is like good entertainment should be Adventurous exciting and simple to follow. The movie truly is none stop fun entertainment to watch with lots of spectacular moments with the legendary skeleton fight as the ultimate highlight. You don't have to be a fan of 'classic' movies in order to enjoy this movie everyone should be able to appreciate this movie and be entertained by it especially when you are a fan of ancient Greek tales.Something that is not praised enough of this movie is the musical score by Bernard Herrmann.The movie is not exactly filled with impressive and memorable actors. As many movies as I have seen in my life I don't think I have ever seen any actors from this movie in any other movie with the exception of course of Honor Blackman who will always be remembered for playing the Bond girl Pussy Galore in Goldfinger. But this movie clearly isn't a characteradventure movie it's a special effect adventure movie. The special effects are really the most important element of the movie.

There are some other nifty creatures for Jason and his crew to battle but for me the most impressive of them all turns up first the gigantic Talos the Man of Bronze.  I was a kid when this came out and I don't think I'll ever forget that moment when the huge crouched statue came to life turned his head towards the two men below him his bronze head screeching with the tear of metal climbed off of his pedestal and proceeded to chase Jason and his men. Talos was giant like Godzilla but as singleminded as the Terminator  all he wants to do is track Jason's crew down until he kills them all.  This gave me nightmares.  Bernard Herrmann's score is one of his best making music to match Harryhausen's images.  Herrmann was coming off of other Harryhausen's plus Hitchcock's Vertigo North by Northwest and Psycho and knew how to thrill you. Tom Hanks who was also a kid when this came out has said  Everybody thinks that 'Citizen Kane' was the greatest movie ever made.

With computer graphics you see it and like it the first time you see it but then many movies of today have the same and it becomes moot.

Although this is let down by its visualization of Olympus the dwelling place of the gods with the immortals using the swimming pool like a gigantic television set for looking in on human intrigues it has seized on mythology as a new format for the monster movie... The special effects  from iron man to an army of skeletons  are nicely conceived and it's just amazing how believable the movements of Ray Harryhausen's creatures are...Chaffey is also responsible for one of the cinema's few excursions into the Prehistoric the second version by Hammer of 'One Million Years B.C.' which has rather less going for it than 'Jason and the Argonauts' because of the boredom inherent in having characters who can converse only in grunts...'Jason and the Argonauts' is a truly family fantasyadventure film directed with wit and excitement... Beverley Cross's fine script is both imaginative and literate and Bernard Herrmann's score is stirring... The word Argonaut comes from a tale sung of the strongest and bravest band of heroes ever assembled in Greek Mythology... This myth chronicles Jason's quest for the 'gift of the gods' and the restoration of his family's throne... There is an interesting theme that runs through the entire motion picture man must manage alone without the help of the gods whether they exist or not... In times past fate ruled men's lives completely... The gods often amused themselves with the puny mortal men below... Fate is still an important factor in Jason's time He has been prophesied to overthrow King Pelias... but man chooses his own life's course... Jason lost his believe in the gods and Zeus questions what has taken the place of man's faith in the gods... Jason replies The hearts of men. Jason rejects Zeus' offer to supply him with 'a ship and a crew' and assembles dozen of Greece's greatest heroes including the legendary Hercules... Nevertheless he accepts Hera's pledge to help him with the information and advice... Jason has learned that prayers to the gods are not always answered... The gods are best served by those who want their help least Zeus alibis... When humans obtain the help of the gods they know they must push forward... For instance when Triton holds the quaking mountains the Argonauts still must navigate their ship away from the dangerous rocks that continue to fall...Jason dared to speak of the end of the gods and challenges Zeus when he eliminates Talos who guards Zeus' treasures... And when the Argonauts imprison the evil harpies whom Zeus sent to torment a desperate sinner Zeus admits If I were to punish every blasphemy I would soon loose all loyalty and respect. Of the gods Jason says In time all men will have to do without them. Such words alarm Zeus and he recognizes as much to Hera whom he considers almost human for staying with him despite such weakness... But the gods still have enough power to do their will... At the picture's end Zeus tells Hera that he will allow Jason and his pretty Medea to enjoy 'each other' but he adds I have not yet finished with Jason... Let us continue with the game another day.Todd Armstrong is the young and hot blooded Jason who schemes to seize the Golden Fleece from King Aeetes and saves Pelias from drowning one day losing his sandal in the river... Nancy Kovack is Medea the provocative high priestess of Colchis who is charmed with love for Jason and aid him in his quest...Gary Raymond is Acastus the son of Pelias sent to disrupt the voyage by causing dissension in the crew...Niall MacGinnis is Zeus who decides to challenge Jason and the Argonauts with many trials...Honor Blackman is the cunning Hera the queen of the gods who outmaneuvered Zeus and intervened on several occasions to facilitate Jason's tasks... Hera wishes to destroy Pelias because he was treacherous and her temple was profane... Michael Gwynn is Hermes who transports Jason to Olympus to speak with the gods... Jack Gwillim is King Aeetes who collects the hydra's teeth from its seven heads and confronts Jason high on a cliff...John Cairney is the clever Hylas who uses his intelligence to beat Hercules in a test of skill... Douglas Wilmer is the nefarious Pelias who plots a devious plan to send Jason on an impossible quest in a faraway land to fetch the magical Golden Fleece... Nigel Green is Hercules the bravest and strongest warrior who vows to search the Isle of Bronze until he finds his friend Hylos...Patrick Troughton is the old and weak Phineas cursed with an insatiable appetite and the flying harpies left enough putrid morsels for him to survive his torment...'Jason and the Argonauts' is a tale of love and betrayal friendship and fortune...

	schema:headline " Ray Harryhausen at his very best";
	schema:reviewBody "This was one of those films I always remember seeing as a child and I never forgot those skeletons which I think is Ray Harryhausen's best work.Greek hero Jason takes a party by ship to search for the Golden Fleece but have to encounter several dangers on the way.  This starts when they drop off at an island with bronze statues to collect food and water.  But one of them goes into the tomb of one of these Talos and steals a gold sword. Talos then comes to life and attacks the crew and during their escape the ship is destroyed.  Talos is destroyed eventually.  While on the island they come across a blind man who gets attacked by two cheeky Harpies who keep eating his food.  They are captured.  They continue their journey and encounter Neptune and arrive on the island where the Golden Fleece is. Before getting the Golden Fleece Jason must fight and kill the Hydra which he does.  The best part of the movie is of course those skeletons near the end.  Jason manages to defeat them when they fall off a cliff into the sea.This has to be one of if not the best of Harryhausen's movies.  Bernard Herrmann was responsible for the excellent music.Jason is played well by Todd Armstrong and Nancy Kovack plays Medea.  These are joined by Bond girl Honor Blackman Goldfinger Laurence Naismith The Valley Of Gwangi Dr Who actor Patrick Troughton who plays the blind man Niall MacGinnis Night of the Demon and Nigel Green as Hercules.This is probably my favourite of Ray Harryhausen's fantasy movies.Rating 5 stars out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "A passing of 45 years has barely diminished the tremendous imagination and ingenuity of this movie.Ray Harryhausen is the man of the moment here and his stopgo animation of miniatures has never encountered serious competition. Each work is a perfect miracle of painstaking attention to detail. The giant guardian statue of Kalos is particularly well suited to his technique. Stopgo motion makes his laboured robotic activity seem all the more realistic. Combined with other specialeffects of the day like mirror filming the interplay between Ray's monstrous creations and the human actors are truly amazing for their age. One particular scene that depicts Kalos's lower leg and heavy footfall observed closeup and from behind has a suspicious similarity to that of a certain Tyrannosaurus from Jurassic Park. I wonder if Mr Spielberg has been plagiarising again  or 'paying homage' as he prefers to call it.Arguably Jason's battle with the animated skeletons is the highpoint of Ray's work. Each skeleton is seen in minutely observed closeup sometimes fullfigure foreground and even enmasse in middle distance. That the whole sequence  or series of sequences  were created frame by frame click after click whilst the live actors intimately choreograph their own play against them is a piece of pure magic. But whether it's skeletons a giant hydra or flying harpies Ray and the specialeffects boys will provide you with entertainment to both marvel and smile at.Sound effects are also very imaginative for their time. Both they and the theme music are aptly suited to the drama they represent. Likewise lighting and colour sets and costumes all live up to standards set by the best sword 'n' sandals epics.Acting however is a mixed bag. Honor Blackman and Nial McGinnis make fine gods and have some excellent dialogue. However Todd Armstrong as Jason and one or two members of his crew look and act like handsome alsorans reminiscent of extras in spaghetti westerns who feature only to make up the numbers and die when required. Occasionally their voices seem dubbed.However a few wooden actors shouldn't put anyone off. With a stirring story to tell and with all of the exotic legendary beauties and beasties brought so wonderfully to life this movie still has the power to enthral each rising generation of young kids even as it did mine.Although stopgo animation is now obsolescent in the context of any 'serious' fantasy having been superseded by CGI Nick Park has demonstrated that it still has a part to play in entertainment and that it can still win fans and even Oscars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hero Jason leads a team of intrepid adventurers in a perilous quest for the legendary Golden Fleece which has amazing healing powers. Jason sails on the Argoship to the land of Colchis seeking for the golden fleece in this mythological romp . This is one of the best sword and sandals film from the history  retelling the legend of Jason in search of the famous fleece for uncharted sea . The film deals with the myth Jason Todd Armstrong son of king of Thesaly  the young prince has had his heritage usurped by his nasty uncle Pelias Douglas Wilmer who has taken the throne . He travels in search for the fabled Golden fleece located in the Colchis where is guarded by sevenheaded hydra . It's based on a poem of Greek poet named Apolonio of Rodas titled The Argonautika 250 B.C . In order to achieve his throne Jason must retrieve the magical calf housed from distant land of Colchis and bring it toward city of Iolco . Jason assembles a motley  brave crew formed by a valiant band as Hercules Nigel Green  Polydeuces Crawford  the traitor Acastus Gary Raymond Castor and others  meanwhile  evil Pelias has usurped the kingdom and taken his throne . Jason successfully leads his crew of wouldbe heroes throughout a series of outstanding adventures . The Argo crew are under the protection of Hera Honor Blackman  queen of the gods . They're confronted by a heinous giant bronze named Talos at an island and many other dangers . Jason saves Medea Nancy Kovack  priestess of Hecate who later to be revenged Jason  killing their sons from waters and both of them go to Colchis . They sail unharmed along sea storm  suffering thirsty  famine and incredible adventures  encountering giant monsters  multitudes of mythological monsters and weird creatures .This exciting picture contains lots of action magic  fastmoving  thrills  impressive fights against monsters and lots of fun . It is an exciting fantasyadventure full of special effects created by means of stopmotion technique by the magician Ray Harryhausen  the Dynamation man . The previous Ray Harryhausen films were generally shown as part of a double feature in B theatres  Columbia and the producer Charles H Schneer were able to book this film as a single feature in many A theatres in the United States. This time the large list of monsters result to be the following  a huge moving sculpture of Talos  as they battle against harpies  a venomous creature as hydra and an animated terrifying skeleton army all brought to life by the special effects masterfully created by the maestro wizardry Ray Harryhausen who regards this as his best film. In the 7th voyage of Sinbad  Ray designed a swordbattling skeleton  here we see a whole army of them for Jason and his crew to fight at the ending of the film . It took Ray Harryhausen four months to produce the skeleton scene a massive amount of time for a scene which lasts at the most three minutes . The runtime is adequate with various incidents and subplots . Harryhausen works his animation magic around a passabledeveloped screenplay and engaging acting by the entire performers . The cast is enjoyable with effective but unknown main actors  though important secondary Brit actors as Laurence Naismith Argo Niall McGinnis Zeus  Honor Blackman Hera  Michael Gwinn Hermes  Jack Gwillin Aetes . As usual in Sword and Sandal films here appears the choreographic girls dancing and lots of action with several adventures including spectacular fights  storms  witchery and some good effects . This elaborate recounting was well directed by Don Chaffey although with little relation with the poem by Apolonio of Rodas . The film contains an evocative and powerful musical score by Bernard Herrmann conducting the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra . Colorful and spectacular cinematography by the great Wilkie Cooper . Fun for the whole family though it tends toward the ponderous at times but for the most part  it's a marvelous and entertaining movie . Other adaptations about this classic story are the following  Giant of Tessaly by Riccardo Freda with Ronald Carey and Massimo Giroti  Hercules by Pietro Francisci with Steve Reeves  Sylva Koscina and for TV Jason and the Argonauts2000 by Nick Willing with Jason London  Frank Langella and Olivia Williams .".

The goddess Hera protects Jason and his crew as they encounter their adventures. There are bronze Talos Harpies Clashing Rocks and fighting skeletons. In the the end Jason gets the Fleece. He also gets the girl Medea. Medea is played by Nancy Kovak and she does a seductive dance. The animation is by Ray Harryhausen who would later do Clash of the Titans. The two films are similar.

	schema:headline " Great ancient action and adventure";
	schema:reviewBody "Before estimating a movie about Greek mythology one should remember that there has never been a movie that follows a myth linebyline and therefore I don't think it is a good idea to judge this type of movie by what it contains and what it omits. The most interesting thing to observe is that how a movie makes an old myth interesting for a modern viewer. The myths in the antiquity were also told in several versions and reinterpretations and so any modernization is just as good as the final outcome.Jason and the Argonauts is not a recent movie any longer but its unique approach to an ancient subject is what makes it interesting viewing. In the time when the facility of computer animations were not available the special effects had to be done in more archaic manner and seeing some legendary monsters as puppetanimations may seem ridiculous to some people. To me their grotesque appearance however seemed more natural and fascinating than all too sterile computer graphics of this modern day.In the original myth about the Argonauts there had been many more material that could have been used in the film but in this version of the myth the focus on the action against the encountered monsters. The expected romance between Jason and Medeia will be of less importance too but many divine interventions will happen. Shortly put there will be more action than drama this time.".

	onyx:emotionText "Before estimating a movie about Greek mythology one should remember that there has never been a movie that follows a myth linebyline and therefore I don't think it is a good idea to judge this type of movie by what it contains and what it omits. The most interesting thing to observe is that how a movie makes an old myth interesting for a modern viewer. The myths in the antiquity were also told in several versions and reinterpretations and so any modernization is just as good as the final outcome.Jason and the Argonauts is not a recent movie any longer but its unique approach to an ancient subject is what makes it interesting viewing. In the time when the facility of computer animations were not available the special effects had to be done in more archaic manner and seeing some legendary monsters as puppetanimations may seem ridiculous to some people.

Concerning Jason's voyage to claim the mystical golden fleece from the far side of the world and use its power to free his homeland from an evil ruler and his cruel offspring.With the aid of his heavenly benefactor the queen of the olympian gods Hera Jason assembles the greatest warriors of ancient greek society to capture the prize.The downside of 'Jason' is the fact that the human stars of the film  are far less engaging than those dipicted in Sinbad. In fact the main actors are rather stilted. Todd Armstrong as Jason for example is as wooden as a sagging birch tree. But who cares. Harryhausen's stop motion wizardy is even more stunning than in Sinbad.Among the more intridging visual whammys are a seven headed hydra. A small army of skeleton warriors. A two hundred foot tall titan warrior made of bronze. And a pair of winged demon harpies.Like 'Sinbad' 'Jason' somehow failed to be noticed at oscar time. Its astounding special effects weren't even nominated. Meanwhile the effects oscar that year went to the rather pedestrian Cleopatra. Apparently  Ray Harryhausen's monsters are no match match for the shapely charms of Elizabeth Taylor. As the a great man once said......It was beauty that killed the beast.".

ALong the way of course he encounters that most dangerous of obstacles Harryhausen's imagination. A towering bronze giant picture an ancient Greek version of aa cross between Godzilla and the Terminator named Talos Winged Harpies who torment a blind prophet a seven headed hydra who gaurds the fleece and best of all seven armed skelitons. The hydra is probably the only one I was disapointed by. It looks great but it doesn't really do much. However considering the work poor Harryhuasen did for what it is I should be glad it's in there at all. The Skeliton swordfight is the best sequence in the film. It is in fact one of the best sequences ever. I've never seen anything like it! Jason and his men make actual contact with the things they actually grab their weapons and punch them down! It's incredible! A definite must see for anyone who even knows the name Harryhausen and for everyone else. If for nothing else then for the skelitons".

	schema:reviewBody "Jason and the Argonauts is a verycolorful idealevelfantasy of the 1960s. This was a stopmotion animation project and an unusually strong production whose subject was a mythical Argive hero of ancient Greece. Historians have theorized his voyage actually took him to South America the Black Sea or other destinations an epic poem was written about him. Here Colchis is not located except at the end of the world. The storyline takes this disenfranchised rightful young king on a voyage aboard the ship Argo he recruits the greatest athletes of Greece to be his rowers and companions and sails off to the Land of Colchis to bring back The Golden Fleece and win a kingdom. What he does not know is the man who sent him after the great prize is destined to be replaced on his throne by Jason and so is looking for ways to get rid of him and kill him even sending his son along for the purpose. The casting is curious. Todd Armstrong looks manly but was dubbed because of an intrusive US accent. Nigel Green excels as Hercules Nancy Kovack and Douglas Wilmer are very good as Medea and the evil king as the gods of Olympus the codirector Ray Harryhausen cast Niall Nacginis as Zeus athletic Honor Blackman as Hera and effective Michael Gwynn as Hermes. The film is stolen by Laurence Naismith as Argus the ship's designer who goes along to participate in many adventures. And there are Harryhausen's monstersa talking figurehead of Hera the bronze god Talos Poseidon who parting the clashing rocks the harpies a sevenheaded hydra that guards the Fleece and especially the army of skeletons sown from the dragon's teeth of Cadmus by King Aeetes of Colchis with whom Jason and his men wage a fascinating battle of swords. The story is slender but it holds up well as a funlevel adventure for all ages. The musical main theme by Bernard Herrmann is magnificent and memorable the costumes and sets are surprisingly authentic. But the finest delight is the ideas in the script by Beverly Cross and Jan Read the mostquoted line is spoken by Zeus when he tells an eager Jason that the gods love those best who call on them for help the least. Don Chaffey directed with Harryhausen very energetically. This important line stands as the opposite in meaning to the philosophy that did not help an expensive sequel made by Harryhause years later Clash of the Titans. Some scenes in this narrative are very memorable such as the clashing rocks the court of Colchis the attack on a city by the evil king the contests all too brief to choose the champions as crew for the ship and the Olympus segment where Jason standing onto a god's hand is introduced to the gods and is granted only three pieces of help from Hera during his quest the escape of the Argo in the fog from Aeetes' fleet and the aforementioned battle with the skeletons. It is curious as Derek Elly also pointed out that the US filmmakers have never made a single fictional film about the ancient Greek or republican Roman past that is their ethical heritage could it be the individualism of men in the classic Age that Hollywood tsars could not graspin that classic age as in their own? This is not quite a great film but it is vivid wellmade and everywhere entertaining.".

I saw it when I was only four years old but the incredible images stayed with me for years until I saw the movie again when I was 11 or 12. Since then I never tire of the movie's sights sounds and ideas.Of course much credit should go to FX master Ray Harryhausen but there is more than special effects that makes this movie work. It is altogether more adult than the Sinbad movies and is a thoughtprovoking meditation on free will and the nature of destiny. Jason is the kind of man the Gods fear the most for he does not fear them or particularly want their help. He accepts the aid of the goddess Hera but this is more because Hera is smitten with him than any other reason. When he snarls The Gods of Greece are cruel! In time all men shall learn to do without them! it is a supreme act of defiance. And yet the Sea God Triton then gives Jason his grudging aid proving that men still depend on the Gods.Performances are underrated here. Todd Armstrong makes a fine Jason who relies on skill rather than muscle to accomplish his goals. The very fine actor Niall McGinnis is excellent as Zeus King of the Gods. His version of the character is far superior to the one portrayed by Olivier in Clash of the Titans. Nigel Green is outstanding as Hercules...arrogant charismatic and ultimately tragic. Instead of a souped up muscleman Green's Hercules is a burly believable veteran. As for Nancy Kovack as Medea her performance is mediocre but she is gorgeous as the mysterious High Priestess of Hecate.Another great asset of the film is the heroic score by Bernard Herrmann who did much of his best work for the SchneerHarryhausen fantasy films. The beautiful Aegean scenery also helps the authenticity.At the end of the day though it's always the monsters that fans talk about. What an incredible collection of creatures they are! I still remember the thrill of fear I felt as a four year old when the mighty head of Talos the Bronze Giant turned to look at Hylas and Hercules. The Harpies and their torment of blind Phineas also left a strong impression. The Hydra despite looking very cool was something of a disappointment...it would have been better if he had put up more of a fight. But nobody could complain about the Children of the Hydra's Teeth...bony skeleton warriors filled with bloodlust! This was Harryhausen's crowning moment.The abrupt ending of the movie disappointstoo. I think everybody wanted to see Jason reclaim his kingdom from Pelias. But you can't have everything and Jason and the Argonauts more than earns its keep as my favorite fantasy film of all time.".

When the priest of a humble temple transfigures into the god Hermes Herrmann's magnificent score along with the shocked fearful look on Jason's face shows us that even Jason the selfprofessed doubter is overwhelmed by the experience. When the ship's crew realises that the figurehead on the prow is actually a living speaking manifestation of Hera they all bow down on the deck many averting their gaze from the awefull sight. Even though Jason eventually defeats the mighty Talos from the moment that we see Hercules and Hylas approaching Talos's monument the camera's perspective shows us how tiny and insignificant these mortals are when compared to gods and Titans well Talos seems to be fulfilling the role of a Titan even though traditional legends have him as a bronze man presumably much smaller and in Crete not on the route to Colchis. The genius of Herrmann's score and how it fits handinglove with the emotional content of the film cannot be overemphasized. By the way the remake decades later is totally out of touch with this feeling of awe discussed above besides containing some strange innovations to make the story more politically correct.".

	schema:headline " Childhood fav n one of the best from the 60s.";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this on a VHS with my dad when i was only 7 years old. I got terrified seeing the giant Talos. The incredible images stayed with me for years until I saw the movie again when I was 13. This movie is my childhood fav. Saw many times after that. Bought a VHS in the 80s. Bought a vcd in very late 90s. Saw this few years back with my kids. A very nostalgic n one of the finest 60s monsteradventurehorror film fr me. It is a fun quickly paced adventure movie. The movie has a towering bronze giant named Talos. Winged Harpies who torment a blind ol man. A seven headed hydra who gaurds the fleece. N the best for the last armed skeleton warriors. The main attraction of the film is the special effects work of Ray Harryhausen The 7th voyage of sindbad One Million Years BC The Valley of Gwangi The Golden Voyage of Sinbad Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger and Clash of the Titans.Special thanx to the producer Charles H. Schneer who was famous for his collaborations with Ray Harryhausen. Together they created some of the bestloved fantasy and science fiction films to grace the silver screen. It is one of the best of the swordandsandal epics. The scene where the giant appears from around the cliff was awesome. There is also some decent score by Bernard Hermann. The man behind the woodwinds of Citizen Kane the shrieking violins of Psycho and the saxophone of Taxi Driver. Only one bad thing about this film the abrupt ending of the movie. Its directed by Don Chaffey One million years bc.".

A concept and script by Garrison Keilor uses every natural and technical element of working with a tight and close ensemble producing a weekly show to sooth us and guide us through the natural but difficult transitions of aging becoming less relevant and then dying as new young life develops and strengthens during our final performances. This is a rare film for it's remarkable cast and crew and one wonders how the great Robert Altman was able to gather them all at the same place and time to shoot this film.";

	schema:reviewBody "As usual Altman will divide his audience in a radical way. He clearly doesn't do it on purpose but it happens more often than not with the works of real artists where there is no room or very little for concessions. It is what it is his vision his whole. He mentioned that the film was about death and found that not everyone agreed not even some of his closest and more devoted collaborators. That's what he saw that's what it is but it's bound to be contradicted by critics and audiences alike. Personally I don't think I'll see a better film this year. The work of an idiosyncratic artist and masterful craftsman doesn't hit the main stream screens every day of the week. My only reservation is that the film is too short. I wanted to go on and on and on. To say that Meryl Streep is sublime seems kind of redundant but never mind she is sublime surprising funny very funny moving very very moving. Lily Tomlin and Meryl have the best moments in the film. They appear look and sound as if they had been working together all their lives. Total chemistry. Lindsay Lohan is the biggest surprise. Good for her. That's the way to forge a way ahead. Work with the best. Woody Harrelson and John C Reilly are simply glorious. Kevin Kline does a Kevin Kline in the most enchanting way. It was also a delight to see Garrison Keillor himself playing himself not just wonderfully but very convincingly as well. I recommend it with all my heart.".

The ensemble cast is superb without exception. Garrison Keillor has a face made for radio but I understand why he has to play himself. Nice baritone but those are weaponsgrade eyebrows.Altman pokes fun at standard 21st century American movie fare but mid20th century radio gets lampooned pretty well too. The eponymous radio show the state of Minnesota and mindless belief all takes it in the slats. Even irony itself is not safe from Altman's watchful eye. It's deliciously subtle and by starts wonderfully bawdy. Paying attention pays dividends. Doing subtle right takes a lot of work.One of the sweet surprises is that people you knew could act can also sing Merryl Streep Lily Tomlin Woody Harrelson not a typo Lindsey Lohan and John C. Reilly croon. Where else could they strut such stuff? Underplaying their roles never stealing a scene letting the wellwritten script be the star. Kevin Kline was never better not even in Wanda. Al Gore's old roommate is heartlessly evil.I'm glad I watched it alone because I felt free to laugh out loud. That would have been out of character with the movie.It's unlikely you would only like this movie. You'll love it or run the other way. I didn't want it to end.Don't look for a sequel.".

Marilyn Monroe about posing nude on her famous calendar.If there is anyone more laid back or brighter than Garrison Keillor in show business let me know because Robert Altman's A Prairie Home Companion based on Keillor's longrunning Minnesota Public Radio saga shows Keillor as an audience sees him each weeklike a god gently guiding an eccentric ensemble through excellent performances made to look as easy as his demeanor. This film stands near Altman's Nashville as a testimony to the director's gift for sustaining strong characters in layers of dialogue approximating overlapping conversations at an interesting party.Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin as the singing country Johnson sisters bring back memories of Reese Witherspoon's amazing turn as June Carter and Streep's own previous country singer in Postcards. Ditto Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly as the singing and joking Dusty and Lefty. But best of all is Kevin Kline as Keillor's real radio creation Guy Noir the '40's dapper inquisitive naughty narrator and security head for the production. Klein embodies the melancholic mood always at least hidden underneath any show's last show despite Keillor's nonchalant assertion that every show is your last show. Around this realistic charming premise of talented performers at their last performance writer Keillor interjects a ghostly beauty in a white leather trench coat Virginia Madsen playing Dangerous Woman the spirit of death gently accompanying those about to die and the moribund show itself. The character is a lyrical embodiment of the theme that nothing lasts but the love shared in any experience. Keillor remains in character after someone dies by stating he doesn't do eulogies. Nor does he do one for the show which in real life still lasts in St. Paul from 1974.So enjoyable are Altman his ubiquitous HD camera and his busy dialogue that you feel a part of the proceedings catching the sweet smell of success for everyone attached to this thoroughly realized song of love to theater music and creativity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Altman begins A Prairie Home Companion with a reference to Edward Hopper's Nighthawks it's a wet and rainy night but sitting inside the warm glow of a 1950's styled diner detective Guy Noir nurses a cup of coffee. He then pays his tab stands up and walks outside pulling his coat over his shoulders as he braves the rain. In this one sequence Altman sets up the paradisaical enclaves of warmth light and shelter that will feature throughout the film. The world is a harsh and uninviting place but the lights of a diner the songs of a radio the crackle of campfire tales help us all get through the night.The film's plot then unfolds in typical Altman fashion. A gang of singers and radio performers gather together at the Fitzgerald Theatre for their final performance. The theatre is being closed down and so a mood of nostalgia regret and sadness hangs heavy in the air.As the film progresses it then becomes apparent that all its conversations and subplots hinge on death suicide temporality failed relationships and regret. Nothing is permanent everything passes. Indeed Guy Noir the film's singers and the Fitzgerald Theatre itself are literally and figuratively out of time they belong to an era which has long passed or is passing away.And yet whilst the many sequences anecdotes and conversations that run throughout the film emphasise perishability you'd be hard pressed to find a film more cosy and inviting. Time and time again Altman clashes the warmth of friends and family with ominous feelings of dread death and a kind of festering temporality. A song sung by actress Lindsay Lohan toward the end of the film seems to be the point at which they intersect suicide death impermanence family and art coming together to form something that is at once beautiful and sad. The result is that the film eventually becomes both elegy AND a celebration of the way humans huddle around flickering camp fires to tell stories and sing songs in an effort to stave off the darkness. And as Altman's title suggests companionship  be it the companionship afforded by communities or strangers on radios  becomes the key to weathering what is really an existential storm.But what makes Companion great is the graceful way in which it carries itself. Altman's camera is fluid always shifting planes always moving slightly always a bit higher or lower than usual. Altman hasn't used this style since The Long Goodbye but here modern technology and lighter cameras have allowed him to attain a new level of grace. There's none of the rigidity of Short Cuts or Kansas City but instead a sort of elegance that Altman has tried and often failed to attain throughout his career effortlessly switching back and forth between characters sounds and spaces without the use of intrusive zooms. One wishes all of Altman's films were shot this way. There are other great things here as well. Not since MASH has Altman assembled such a warm bunch of people. Actors Woody Harrelson Streep Tomlin and Lohan are all either hilarious or infectious and Kevin Kline's private detective Guy Noir somehow manages to straddle the line between funny and effortlessly cool. With his overelaborate Chandleresque dialogue he's arguably the funniest noir detective since Jeff Lebowski.Then there's the music which at times surpasses the ballet sequences of Altman's The Company the jazz music of Kansas City and the country music of Nashville. It's hard not to crack a smile when Harrelson sings Bad Jokes a song which seems to be about women and horses but is really about the biggest bad joke of all life. Elsewhere the film's skits and songs manage to be both moving and funny.Then there's the film's location The Fitzgerald Theatre with its dark rooms romantic lights and cosy atmosphere. Altman's camera probes these rooms and corridors creating a tangible sense of place. He sketches a location that manages to be homey and inviting but also incredibly precious like the flickering glow of a dying candle flame.The film ends powerfully. The Fitzgerald Theatre has long been shut down and so our radio performers a pair of cowboys a noir detective an old man and two gospel singers sit around a diner table discussing old times and talking about their struggles to find new jobs. An angel of death then approaches this table at which point Altman switches to the angel's POV and has his cast look directly down his camera. Is it my turn now? their faces imply. Are you here for me?The result is that we the audience become death Altman's cast's very existence now dependent on us. Do we listen do we watch do we read or do we turn away? Altman both implicates and chooses for us suddenly cutting to a shot of the performers all back at the Fitzgerald Theatre singing and having a blast. This of course is a direct contrast to the pessimistic ending of Altman's Five And Dime Jimmy Dean a similar film which ended with ominous shots of a decaying and dilapidated diner death claiming the film's cast and landscape.It's such juxtaposition which makes Companion special. Less caustic than most of Altman's pictures the film's very much an intimate wheel of creation and destruction of men withering away and babies blossoming into existence of characters giddily sneaking off to make love and pregnant women cursing their heavy stomachs of art warming the soul and time looming heavy on the mind like a thundercloud.9.510  Everything here Altman's done before but never with such economy grace beautiful acting and humour. Prairie is funnier than Mash sadder than McCabe more noir than The Long Goodbye has better music Kansas City and perhaps makes better use of spaces than Gosford Park. Fittingly Altman died after the film was completed. It's arguably his last masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "A gentle piffle A Prairie Home Companion is the Summer's most lovely find  a movie that is easy on the ears and seemingly made of sheary impossible gossamer that would spindle or crush under a more heavyhanded production.The impressive cast seems to be having a whole lot of fun  Meryl Streep Kevin Kline Lily Tomlin Woody Harrelson Lindsay Lohan LQ Jones et al all have perfunctory if labored singing voices but it is scripter Garrison Keillor that is the thread that stitches this one together so well. The result is an infectious genial collection of characters and occasions whose easy charms stay with the viewer days after the film finally unspools its last credit.Although I have never heard a PHC performance before the film plays as a tribute to the old days of radio shows and more over a loving though chilly valentine to the radio days of old. Anyone old enough though not near an NPR station might not know the show but most certainly can hum the tune.Keillor he with an alienlike E.T. observation of the goingson at the final performance of his 30 yearold live radio show has a wonderful announcer voice and an above average singing voice that anchors the honest down home cornpone credibility of the film. He is a cypher through the picture  a guy you could listen to for hours chat about his exploits introduce faux commercials and sing a song about nothing in particular. GK has such an ethereal presence that you look at him with such amazement because a regular joe like he earns such a shorthand with his audience and can stand toe to toe with aplomb next to Oscar winners like Kline and Streep. It's a great understated performance.The movie directed by the legendary Robert Altman has such a light touch that it's hard to not fall easily into it's flow. It's dreamy slight and surreal yet sets up its universe that is vaguely of today  but what world still has an actual radio show broadcast across the nation so detailed and entertaining as this? Altman and Keillor do the amazing  they deny the audience of any cheap emotion and pathos or short cuts to pay off the scenario. As much as this movie is about the wistful honor and simple entertainment of such a radio programs that used to rule the airwaves in the 1930s through the 1950s both writer and director refuse to pander to suspected emotional payoffs or happy endings that lesser film creators might. This is a cold simple and honest movie about the last kick at the can of a venerable institution and as they choreograph it so what? Every show as Keillor says in the film is the last show. Big deal.Despite it's frigid demeanor A Prairie Home Companion is filled with warm quiet moments that offers each cast member has a shining sterling moment of performance  though none takes centre stage and overpowers or overacts. If anyone goes swinging for the balconies its Altman regular Tomlin who creates such a wonderful counterbalance to Streep's simple honest Minnesotan singing sister partner that she stands as the picture's meta heart  a desperate hardened yet proud woman backed into a career corner who doesn't know what to do after her regular job is prematurely retired by big radio business. Tomlin deserves an Oscar.For a film that is steeped in a sentimentality that no longer exists Altman keeps his sharpened artist eye wandering the set for the most interesting player in the room instead of mourning the sad gone before. There's no release in the movie no eulogy for the past. A Prairie Home Companion is a straightforward document of what was not what could have been or what will be.The director's brilliance is that his lens cares about what technical and bits of business that come to affect in the making of the final show which really tell the story  of a group of people who spend their Saturday nights singing songs telling stories and transmitting their folksy wellwishes to an imaginary audience listening in on their bedside table radio. In the movie Altman and Keillor let their staged audience seated in the cavernous Fitzgerald Theater in Minneapolis or those sitting in shoebox movie theater in Anywhere USA fill in the relevance.One of the best movies of the year.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Prairie Home Companion rating 3.5 out of 4In truth I'm not one to worship Robert Altman. His filmsbarring the raritieshave been for me mostly inconsequential. They're wispy and lighthearted and mostly nonchalant. They work but on a momentary basis acting like a bubble that bursts the second the lights go up. Most of the same can be said about A Prairie Home Companion. Only this time is simply works better. Garrison Keillor who penned the A Prairie Home Companion radio show also works the fingers behind the typewriter for its film adaptation. His script has a kind of concentrated structure to it it's duration running throughout A Prairie Home Companion's final live broadcasted show. He balances onstage performance between backstage interactions the camera smoothly swirling amongst the audience the stage and the inner workings of the theatre. If Altman flashed the negative to achieve a washedout look for The Long Goodbye he did quite the opposite for A Prairie Home Companion. The cinematography is rich and sensational often whirling between different sets in long gorgeously extended shots. This isn't your typical backstage DV debacle but the work of a director at the very height of his career.The cast is yet another stunning ensemble most of them probably flocking to Altman's direction. Beat this Meryl Streep Woody Harrelson Kevin Kline Lily Tomlin Virginia Madsen Tommy Lee Jones Lindsay Lohan John C.Reilly and Garrison Keillor. Yeah. The beauty of the film is that none of these actors quite seem to be acting. Attribute this to Altman's classic overlapping dialogue but don't forget to bow your heads to the performers as well. Often I'm annoyed by Altman's stubborn persistence with overlapping dialogue. I'll argue that when Altman should be trying to make cinema he insists on imitating real life. But with A Prairie Home Companion the overlapping dialogue is mandatory. Altman's best when he's making a film mostly about people and not about story. This is most obvious here. My one complaint with the film is its aversion to storyline. But this isn't too much of a problem because A Prairie Home Companion is if nothing else about the people of the radio show. This is a story about human beings where overlapping dialogue is only expected. The story finds itself toeing the line with magical realism. Virginia Madsen plays The Dangerous Woman who Guy Noir Kevin Kline first describes as a femme fatale and later as an angel. As she convinces us of her divinity Noir finds a way to use her as an assassin to ward off the buyers of the radio show. This fantasy element works only to heighten the vibrancy of the rest of the film where feet stay firmly planted to reality. Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin play the singing sisters Yolanda and Rhonda Johnson with Lindsay Lohan as their gloomy daughter Lola. The three as contrasting as the actors are on paper flit about in a realm of familial nostalgia with Lola penciling out her suicidal songs and scoffing beside their makeup mirrors. John C. Reilly and Woody Harrelson are Dusty and Lefty the singing cowboys who crack dirty jokes backstage and jerk the chain of censorship with Al Tim Russell the stage manager. Chuck Akers L.Q. Jones and Evelyn Marylouise Burke are the elderly lovebirds who chase a potentially fatal lovemaking. And holding all these characters together is Garrison Keillor whose nostalgia is matched only by his pragmatism and lack of sentimentality towards the show's demise. His performance is probably the most memorable as the picture is fuller when he strolls about within it offering truth to the blind antics of some of the other roles with his endless cache of stories.A Prairie Home Companion's bubble doesn't burst as the lights go up. Instead we find ourselves wishing the show would go on and the performers keep up doing their crazy little acts. This is Altman in his element where humans are meant to be portrayed as humans. It's still lighthearted and mostly nonchalant sure but it's also about nostalgia and reminiscence and the beauty that surrounds a family built behind the red curtains and a WLT microphone.".

There we see Guy Noir whose job is managing security for the A Prairie Home Companion radio program. Soon we are in the theater preparing for the live performance of the radio program. Virtually all the remainder of the movie happens in the Fitzgerald.Note I have attended two APHC performances in the Fitzgerald and have eaten in Mickey's Diner. The exteriors in the movie are all real and the stage the sets and auditorium shots of the Fitzgerald are likewise genuine. Even a brief shot of a church near the theater toward the end of the movie is genuine. You can see some photos at PHCFan.com. The stage action in the movie is just like it happens in real life. Whether the dressingroom scenes and GK's disregard for deadlines are similar to reallife I don't know.During much of the movie we are puzzled by a mysterious woman in white who has certainly caught Guy Noir's eye...her garments are so tight he can read the embroidery on her panties. She walks calmly around the stage and through the set during the show itself. We learn her identity in the second half of the movie.The reallife Sue Scott plays a hairdresser in the movie a speaking role. Even if you don't recognize her face you will recognize her voice. All the other regulars seem to play themselves.The movie audience really enjoyed the movie. We laughed heartily at the jokes and applauded at the end. It is a feelgood movie a mustsee for fans of the weekly radio program.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Prairie home companion is the sort of movie that ten minutes into it you either love it or lose interest. I loved it enough to consider it among the bests in 2006.With an auteur type of opening credit A Robert Altman film it bring your mind right back to Oscar Night this year in which 81yearold Mr Altman was presented with an award for his special achievement. Your mind may then go further back to this remarkable director's earlier classics such as MASH 1970 and McCabe and Mrs Miller 1971 and most recent work including Gosford Park 2001 and The Company 2003 and others within this 30year time span. The ensuing alphabetical listing of a remarkable extensive cast tells you right away that this is a piece of ensemble work and if you enjoy that kind of movie or play you can expect to be in for a good time looking at the names that appeared. Ironically at the centre and head of this ensemble dream cast is someone who is not a movie star one Garrison Keillor legendary radio host to the circle of loyal followers but relatively unknown to the rest of the world. This is very much his story.To say story however is misleading because there is none to speak of in the sense that there is really no plot. The movie is about the last show of Keillor's live radio broadcast of A Prairie home companion but is fictionalize because in real life the radio station that ran the program was not bought up and there is no forced close down of the program.A lot of what we see though is based on the real program and unless you have been a regular listener it's hard to tell which characters are made up and which are real. The entire movie is a realtime depiction of the last radio show with a live audience at the Fitzgerald Theatre both on stage and at backstage think David French's play Jitters. Through an assembly of fascinating yet ordinary characters we are vastly entertained moved to sombre reflections and brought to an uncontrollable state of elation as the end credit rolls. There is never a dull moment. Berardinelli is too young and impatient so for this particular movie listen to Ebert. Interestingly A.O. Scott who is only one year older than Berardinelli is much more appreciative.So who are these characters that make this such a wonderful movie? I'll only mention a few and leave the rest for you to discover and delight in if this movie is your cup of tea.First on the list is Meryl Streep. Having seen her this year in The Devil wears Prada and Prime reaffirms where no reaffirming is really necessary what breadth and depth this amazing actress is capable of. But it's not until I saw Lily Tomlin that I was almost in awe and disbelief that Streep's performance can be bettered albeit ever so slightly. The two play the remaining of the four sisters in a musical family that is not unlike The Carter Family except for NOT being famous. It's an absolutely sublime cinematic experience to see these two in one of the opening scenes playing the two sisters reminiscing the good old days in front of Yolanda's Streep daughter Lindsay Lohan. There is of course the overlapping dialogue the two of them demonstrated so admirably in this year's Oscar night. But much more than that in a deeper layer you see the two simple women who have had their share of vicissitude come to life right in front of your eyes obscuring the two great actresses you know so well. Yolanda and Rhonda they have completely transformed to as if you had never heard about Streep and Tomlin. And I haven't even started to talk about their performance on stage when Rhonda and Yolanda deliver their versions of Stephen Foster's Old folks at home  Way down upon the MISSISSIPPI river  that brings the whole house down. Another pair that I would just mention is the singing cowboys played by John C. Reilly and Woody Harrelson who in addition to toetapping melodies also delivers bad jokes among which this one is considered mild  Why is diarrhoea hereditary? Because it runs in the jeans. You get the idea.And as long as we are in the comedy department there is one scene that is murderously hilarious when the script from which host G.K. played by Garrison Keillor of course is supposed to read is dropped accidentally on the floor together with another thousand pieces of paper. Everybody starts to help ad lib improvising to the extent of posing an ultimate challenge to the sound effect guy right at front stage using his mouth mostly. If a good laugh is what you are after this scene alone is worth your admission price.But it's not just about having a good laugh. It's a total experience that makes you rejoice at being alive. There is a wonderful cast too many to mention within the IMDb word limit. The three more prominent of them Kevin Kline Tommy Lee Jones and Virginia Madsen will each easily take a page. But this is really Garrison Keillor's show. He is so much the soul of A Prairie home companion nay he is so much A Prairie home companion himself that ironically he doesn't seem to care that this is his last show. Every show is your last show he philosophizes. A Prairie home companion  one of the bests in 2006.".

	onyx:emotionText "A Prairie home companion is the sort of movie that ten minutes into it you either love it or lose interest. I loved it enough to consider it among the bests in 2006.With an auteur type of opening credit A Robert Altman film it bring your mind right back to Oscar Night this year in which 81yearold Mr Altman was presented with an award for his special achievement. Your mind may then go further back to this remarkable director's earlier classics such as MASH 1970 and McCabe and Mrs Miller 1971 and most recent work including Gosford Park 2001 and The Company 2003 and others within this 30year time span. The ensuing alphabetical listing of a remarkable extensive cast tells you right away that this is a piece of ensemble work and if you enjoy that kind of movie or play you can expect to be in for a good time looking at the names that appeared. Ironically at the centre and head of this ensemble dream cast is someone who is not a movie star one Garrison Keillor legendary radio host to the circle of loyal followers but relatively unknown to the rest of the world. This is very much his story.To say story however is misleading because there is none to speak of in the sense that there is really no plot. The movie is about the last show of Keillor's live radio broadcast of A Prairie home companion but is fictionalize because in real life the radio station that ran the program was not bought up and there is no forced close down of the program.A lot of what we see though is based on the real program and unless you have been a regular listener it's hard to tell which characters are made up and which are real.

Is this a real representation of the PHC radio audience andor the PHC staff? It disturbed me seemed forced and fake. Are most PHC fans in this target audience? I think not.The music was a hoot of course including all of its ragged edges and the Norwegian fish jingle. However it seemed too 'southern' to me. Where was the nonsouthern folk music that was such a main component of the show over the decades?Kevin Kline as always a marvel and a delight. So fine to hear his meltedbutter voice over the opening scene of Mickey's....in a city that knows how to keep its secrets...!The livestock price reports in the opening 'roving across your radio dial' sequence were a cute true detail. The big stars attempting local or Oshkosh Wisconsin accents were not at all convincing at least to this native. That bugged me. The radio evangelist with a southern accent in the opening radio bits also seemed quite out of place.I wonder how much of the movie is understandable to people who know nothing about the PHC show. The Berlinale audience seemed to 'get' the humor and enjoyed the film.All in all a delight.".

I have some experience in drama etc. and realize how difficult it is to give a restrained performance. Her coup in this role was not what she said and did but what she didn't say or do.

Does one's tolerance for excitement diminish so much with age that I myself would consider this watchable 20 years from now? Can I ever trust IMDb user reviews again after seeing an average score of 7.7 for this most awful of movies? And can I ever enjoy listening to PHC on the radio again after suffering through the two most tedious hours I have ever spent in a movie theater?I went to see it with my girlfriend. She wanted to see The Lake House. I pointed out that it had gotten terrible reviews and it wasn't on for 2 hours and said that she could trust the Prarie Home Companion people. I've been a fan of the show since Reagan was in office.You would think that a 2hour PHC movie could be at least as good as a 2hour PHC radio show. But the movie suffered some major flaws relative to the radio show1. You couldn't get up and iron clothes or file bills or do whatever you do during the musical parts of the show.2. The funny parts of the radio show like the monologue and the skits weren't in the movie.3. The movie didn't set any boundaries between reality and fantasy. In the radio show you always know where the boundaries are between truth and fiction. The sketches are fiction the actors are real. The movie was presented as if the sketches were real. Guy Noir is a real detective Dusty and Lefty are real cowboys. A mildly amusing sketch about an orangutan a rottweiler a flock of geese and a letter from an exlover  much the sort of stuff you might hear on the show  was presented as if the exlover bit was reality so that it was not so much funny as pathetic.4. The movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be slapstick or drama. Really serious things would happen to or be talked about by the actors and I couldn't tell whether we were supposed to sympathize with them or laugh at them. When Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep are talking about their family woes while Lily's daughter reads her bad poems about suicide the stories are just outrageous enough that you can't tell if it's supposed to be a comic piece or character drama.5. I couldn't reconcile the supernatural elements of the plot with the familiar background of the PHC radio show. Not to mention that everything that happens makes no difference and you don't know what happens in the final scene. Also a tip to GK for any future screenplays Introduce the first plot event LESS than one hour into the show.If they had just presented a PHC show without the distracting and uninteresting plot they could have fit in more interesting stuff. If they really wanted to go with a plot they should have cut 5 or 6 musical numbers out to give them a little time to do something with it. Instead they gave us a pseudomovie pseudoradio show with a pseudoplot and pseudocharacters not developed enough to be called 2dimensional. I writhed in my seat waiting for it to end knowing that I would owe my girlfriend bigtime for this. If I'd been there alone I would have walked out. I tried to read a book but she didn't have one and said I had to suffer with her.I have to look on the bright side. It was much worse for my girlfriend  she hates folk music.".

A group of all time favorites are to take place in it. We meet the Johnson sisters a pair of older singers Yolanda and Rhonda who have been around for a while. We also see Dusty and Lefty a pair of singing cowboys and the other acts that lean toward gospel and country and western fare.Throughout the picture a sad woman is seen moving around the theater and the stage. We gather she is not real because of the ethereal clothes she wears until her secret is revealed. She is an innocent victim of the program. There is also the head of security Guy Noir a clownish figure typical of the environment and also the figure of the Axman who has come to put an end to the broadcast from the Fitzgerald theater.This melancholic look at a form of entertainment that has fallen out of favor is greatly reproduced by Mr. Altman. Garrison Keillor serves as the master of ceremonies for the radio broadcast. Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin are excellent as the Johnson sisters. Lindsay Lohan appears as the daughter of Yolanda a confused girl who loves to write songs and poetry about death and suicide. Woody Harrelson and John C.

	schema:reviewBody "Have you ever been in a situation where you know a person who moves with grace? He or she may not be a particularly interesting person nor even a bit of a soulmate. But you like to be near them because they move with such deliberation and beauty that they animate and enlighten the architecture they bless the space you breath with your eyes. You look forward to your next meeting because you yearn that space.Altman is like that for me. He isn't about deliberation or noodling around with reality. He's quite simply the most graceful natural mover I know in cinema. And it isn't just his age he started this notion as far back as McCabe which I recently said was my favorite western when someone insisted on such a recommendation.Part of his fluidity is a conviction that the art is in arranging the mix the vortex before that camera is unpacked. Once it happens all he has to do is discover it as the actors push the space around. Its shocking what he does because it differs so much from the norm which usually frames things spatially so the camera can see them.Part of it has to do with the projects he chooses meandering stories folded and separate. Dozens of characters perhaps. Sometimes its not obvious as when he wanders among suspects in Gosford. Garrison Keillor is a master storyteller based on one trick but what a trick! The whole show revolves around his fictional Lake Wobegon which by accretion in our mind is a place with dozens of characters places and rituals that we know. He'll start a narrative thread for few moments toying with a certain foible then as if he lost his focus he'll take the tail of that morsel as a springboard for a different thread. It may seem to have a similar moral or not. It may have related characters or not. It may even involve a different time. The humor is in the lost threads the jumps the lucid fog.His best rambles may span four of five of these and never return deliberately never return. Its as if he starts with a treetrunk  the town and its collective zeitgeist  and follows a branch and then hops among leaves like a story squirrel.Altman is just the opposite. He starts with the leaves and by circumnavigating the crown of the thing he implies an arboreal being. With his birth and modeling films for example that being isn't so interesting instead its the grace of the squirrel's eye that amazes us.So its no surprise that there is no Wobegon story here. This is Altman's dance imposed on Keillor's. They both know it and Keillor's role is one he does play in the radio show as a sort of peg around which the Maydayers swirl.So see this for the dance the two master dancers but one dance. Along the way you'll see Streep as you never have before. She's so effortless here. Its obvious that she created her character and with the others this is so. Her character is a swimmer in a sea of emotion. She's wet with stories and we find that she was one of Keillor's. Its too sweet an idea knowing what sort of an actor she is and how she applies a sort of ironwilled discipline to what she does which we don't notice because of her absolute commitment. But the world in the long run doesn't love these types.They love the ones that jump in without a plan that are broken from the last dive but leap again. Its a new Streep we see here. Leaves wet with the tears of life ready to fall as her storyteller lights past.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure how anyone could have been expected to make a workable film out of A Prairie Home Companion so I guess writer Garrison Keillor and director Robert Altman shouldn't be judged too harshly for not succeeding in their effort.For those unfamiliar with the source A Prairie Home Companion is a weekly radio variety show that has been broadcast live from a theater in St. Paul Minnesota off and on for well over thirty years. Created and hosted by Keillor the show as its title suggests offers a folksy blend of country music humorous anecdotes live commercial spots and generous helpings of homespun wisdom.For the movie Altman and Keillor chose not to go with the actual PHC cast with the notable exception of Keillor himself but to hire big name movie stars  Meryl Streep Lily Tomlin Lindsay Lohan et. al.  to do the onstage performing as well as enact the fictionalized drama taking place backstage. It is in the drama that the movie runs into its greatest trouble. Needing some sort of narrative hook on which to hang the otherwise disconnected musical sequences the filmmakers have come up with the stale device of a big bad business tycoon from Texas Tommy Lee Jones buying the station and threatening to shut down the program which he sees merely as a quaint little relic from a bygone era. In a bizarre foray into the supernatural the movie also has the angel of death in a white trench coat Virginia Madsen gliding around the theater dropping what amount to little more than pseudoprofundities as she zeroes in on her latest victim. Since Altman was seriously ill at the time of filming this turned out to be his final movie we can understand why so much of the film deals with the issues of death and the melancholic passage of time. But what we can't understand is how he managed to turn A Prairie Home Companion into such a lifeless and uninvolving movie. One wonders how the show itself would have been able to stay on the air for as long as it has if it were really as desultory enervating and dour as it appears to be here. Even the live audience can't seem to muster up much enthusiasm for what's taking place on stage. The least Altman could have done is include some shots of the audience to create at least some sense of interaction between the fans and the performers and gin up some excitement. Instead the people remain shrouded in darkness with only some occasional applause or muted laughter to remind us that they're even there. The movie is far too lackluster and passive in its approach to the subject lacking the energy passion and dynamism one would reasonably expect from a movie centered as this one is on live musical performing watch A Hard Day's Night and A Mighty Wind to see how it can and should be done.The musicianship and singing are unobjectionable and decent if not exactly footstomping or rousing yet even they fail to rouse us out of the lethargy we've been lulled into by the dull behindthescenes drama that somehow passes for a storyline in the film. There are some occasionally funny moments along the way  Kevin Kline scores as an anachronistic security guard straight out of a bad film noir mystery and Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly have some fun as two singing cowpokes whose risqu lyrics offend the producer far more than they do the audience  but there's a definite air of desperation about the project as if the people who came up with the idea just couldn't find any way to really make it work as a film. There are lots of nice little bits floating around inside A Prairie Home Companion but the filmmakers never manage to bring them all together into a movie that really matters much.The tone of sadness that permeates the film makes it more effective as a valedictory for the late director than as a fitting tribute to the goal and spirit of the original Prairie Home Companion.".

It's a situation that I think everyone can relate to in some way. The music even if it isn't of your taste is wildly clever and amusing. The whole cast is brilliant Includingsurprisingly Ms. Lohan who has one particular effective scene. And the direction of course is topnotch. I can't really say more about it than it's just really fun.

	schema:headline " Altman at the top of his game";
	schema:reviewBody "The biggest misconception about Robert Altman's Prairie Home Companion is that it's a film about Garrison Kiellor. It's also the source of its brilliance.Garrison Keillor is currently the host of a popular Minnesotabased radio show A Prairie Home Companion that appeals to Midwestern sensibilities. The showwithinashow is infused with backstage drama as an axe man from a corporation in Texas Tommy Lee Jones is on his way to the studio to shut it down which will make it the show's last broadcast. While Altman transplants Kiellor and his show to the big screen in pretty much the same format the beauty of the film is how the director isn't taking us behind the scenes of the Garrison Kiellor show as he's using the radio host to tell his own story. Altman uses Kiellor and his radio show as a springboard for his own contemplations on life art and death during his twilight years. Those familiar with the director that helped usher American cinema into a new era in the 1970s might be able to draw connections between Kiellor's character and Altman as two Midwesterners who might be considered acquired tastes and who are past their prime. It's a credit to Altman's sense of vision as a director and storyteller that those who are unfamiliar with Garrison Kiellor might not believe he actually exists because that's how naturally he fits into the story.Most films by Robert Altman have a great ensemble and this is no exception. From the dirty jokes of John C. Riley and Woody Harrelson's singing cowboys to Saturday Night Live's Maya Rudolph as a stagehand being driven to insanity by Garrison Kiellor's aloofness to Kevin Kline's bumbling private eye humor and color come from multiple directions. Lily Tomlin Meryl Streep add their talents to the mix as the singing Johnson sisters and Lindsay Lohan holds her own as Streep's slightly offkilter daughter. The film also boasts a great selection of country and folk music sung by many of the film's stars in addition to the radio show's house band. A Prairie Home Companion is a multilayered piece of work that plays like a lightweight breezy afternoon.".

	schema:headline " Outstanding Radio Humor. Almost Lifeless Film.";
	schema:reviewBody "I REAALLLY wanted to like A Prairie Home Companion. This pairing Altman meets Keillor should have been a high summit  like Frank Capra meets Mark Twain. Sadly Altman's nonchalance  and perhaps Keillor's  has drained most of the humor from the funniest show on radio. I consider Garrison Keillor the Mark Twain of our time. He's unbelievably prolific consistently mordent and always gets two or three belly laughs from me each show. His political humor provokes frequent fist pumping in the kitchen where we listen. Keillor gets more out of his typewriter okay word processor than most sitcom Hollywood producers squeeze out of a staff of writers. Has GK EVER done a show in LA? It would be like a whale run aground.Because Keillor lets some of the steam out of the American pressure cooker every week I feel passionately grateful as a fan. But in this film Keillor's expressionless face and lumbering presence just seem frozen. The man is MADE for radio. Sadly not only GK but his comic universe seem UNmade by Altman's film. I have to wonder what Altman thought he was reading shooting editing all those hours in the cutting room  Three Women for comedic masochists? A squirmbox for those who otherwise love laughing? Even the brilliant Kevin Kline whose physical slapstick offers some of the film's rare comic relief appears trapped in an uninspired cameo. There is nothing written for him here that hasn't been surpassed in any of the countless Guy Noire segments on PHC. And the appearances of his foil Virginia Madsen's looming Dangerous WomanAngel was at first merely clumsy then predictable then tedious  a lackluster conception compared to the femme fatales Sue Scott has played on radio for years. Not only isn't this film classic Keillor it's not classic Altman. There's no evidence of the ensemble directing genius of Gosford Park or Nashville. There are few characters and little character work. And this from a legendary actor's director. As a result a show that is usually a feast for the ear becomes an ordeal for the eye. The only human color lighting up the screen in an otherwise overstuffed haphazard collection of characters comes from Kevin Kline Meryl Streep John C. Reilly and Woody Harrelson. All other character presence is perfunctory. A character dies in the first act but you know nothing about him so you don't care. In fact found myself caring very little about anyone on screen. What I did care about was Altman burying PHC's real radio talent  especially Sue Scott  in minor roles. Scott's impersonation talent and Tim Russel's have helped carry PHC's comic skits for years. Yet NO comic skits featuring them were recreated on screen!! What was Altman thinking? Or Keillor? Short of one amusing segment with sound effects genius Tom Keith PHC's REAL talent is shoved to the side so we can here musical number after musical number sung by actors. Did Altman think he was making Nashville again? Or did Keillor? Finally PHC's crack Shoeband is there but even they don't get solos. There's not one shot of Rich Dworsky's incredibly proficent hands in fact no visual appreciation of the band at all. It's as if Altman himself isn't a real fan of the show and doesn't know where the brilliance and talent of PHC lies. Everything takes on a selfconscious drabness that just wearies the heart after about 30 minutes. I guess Altman can't be blamed entirely. GK wrote the screenplay and collaborated on the story. Which leads me to think the budget for this film was tight. Shooting may have been confined to the Fitzgerald auditorium due to fiscal limitations. But the resulting claustrophobia is what disappointed me the most. After years of imagining the Lutheran Minnesota Keillor has portrayed on radio for so long I saw none of it. I expected a few fantasies a Lake Wobegone segment perhaps. Instead we get Altman slowpanning endlessly around rambling characters perfunctorily dollying through a kind of Phantom of the Fitzgerald' cum Last Waltz. He creates a visual mood more suitable to Andrew Lloyd Weber arias than to our last and perhaps greatest American radio comedy show. In the end A Prairie Home Companion is a misconceived project. Its legacy may be that it offers media students an object lesson in the distinctions between radio and film  between the ear's gateway to the visual imagination and the literal eye. It may also show that like songwriters who shine in the short form but bog down in oratorios and opera Keillor the sketch and skit guru hasn't yet found the narrative discipline and stamina of the screenwriter. Mark Twain yes. Woody Allen no. In radio and books Keillor rules. In film Altman usually does. Sadly here we have both geniuses creating a kind of Waiting for Godot a hapless existential deconstruction of everything a beloved radio show has come to mean and hopefully still will to its devoted listeners.".

There are few characters and little character work. And this from a legendary actor's director. As a result a show that is usually a feast for the ear becomes an ordeal for the eye. The only human color lighting up the screen in an otherwise overstuffed haphazard collection of characters comes from Kevin Kline Meryl Streep John C. Reilly and Woody Harrelson. All other character presence is perfunctory. A character dies in the first act but you know nothing about him so you don't care. In fact found myself caring very little about anyone on screen. What I did care about was Altman burying PHC's real radio talent  especially Sue Scott  in minor roles. Scott's impersonation talent and Tim Russel's have helped carry PHC's comic skits for years. Yet NO comic skits featuring them were recreated on screen!! What was Altman thinking? Or Keillor? Short of one amusing segment with sound effects genius Tom Keith PHC's REAL talent is shoved to the side so we can here musical number after musical number sung by actors. Did Altman think he was making Nashville again? Or did Keillor? Finally PHC's crack Shoeband is there but even they don't get solos. There's not one shot of Rich Dworsky's incredibly proficent hands in fact no visual appreciation of the band at all. It's as if Altman himself isn't a real fan of the show and doesn't know where the brilliance and talent of PHC lies. Everything takes on a selfconscious drabness that just wearies the heart after about 30 minutes. I guess Altman can't be blamed entirely. GK wrote the screenplay and collaborated on the story. Which leads me to think the budget for this film was tight. Shooting may have been confined to the Fitzgerald auditorium due to fiscal limitations. But the resulting claustrophobia is what disappointed me the most. After years of imagining the Lutheran Minnesota Keillor has portrayed on radio for so long I saw none of it. I expected a few fantasies a Lake Wobegone segment perhaps. Instead we get Altman slowpanning endlessly around rambling characters perfunctorily dollying through a kind of Phantom of the Fitzgerald' cum Last Waltz. He creates a visual mood more suitable to Andrew Lloyd Weber arias than to our last and perhaps greatest American radio comedy show. In the end A Prairie Home Companion is a misconceived project. Its legacy may be that it offers media students an object lesson in the distinctions between radio and film  between the ear's gateway to the visual imagination and the literal eye. It may also show that like songwriters who shine in the short form but bog down in oratorios and opera Keillor the sketch and skit guru hasn't yet found the narrative discipline and stamina of the screenwriter. Mark Twain yes. Woody Allen no. In radio and books Keillor rules. In film Altman usually does. Sadly here we have both geniuses creating a kind of Waiting for Godot a hapless existential deconstruction of everything a beloved radio show has come to mean and hopefully still will to its devoted listeners.";

With his deep amicable twangy voice droopy bullfrog face and tall shambling gangling build Keillor makes for a marvelously languorous host who effortlessly exudes a considerable amount of infectiously folksy and whimsical downhome charm. Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin are positively fabulous as a singing sister due belting out a bunch of terrifically tuneful country songs with irresistibly hale'n'hearty aplomb and they both sing beautifully too!. Kevin Kline gives a delightfully droll portrayal of a dapper security guard with delusions of being a suave 40's film noirstyle private detective. Viginia Madsen looking absolutely smashing in a bright white trench coat qualifies as the single most attractive and seductive angel of death since Jessica Lange in All That Jazz. John C.

My sole complaints are that the always welcome and splendid Tommy Lee Jones isn't given nearly enough to do as a heartless corporate bigwig who's pulling the plug on the show and the fact that this movie ends period.

	schema:reviewBody "Street Kings 2008 is one of the best cop action thrillers from Keanu Reeves. This movie was released in 11 April 2008 USA after hearing about this movie that Keanu Reeves made another action movie I rushed to see it right away if it is any good and I was right! It is a good action thriller! It is one of my favorite best Keanu Reeves movies I am still a big fan of him and I always enjoy this movie. I also had no idea that Chris Evans Captain America The Winter Soldier Avengers started in this movie as the main support cast opposite of Keanu Reeves. Chris acted outstanding in here as Detective Paul Diskant. This is a slick perfect action thriller about dirty cops and a cop been killed while other cop is blamed and framed for his death by other follow officers now he has to clear his name and punished the guilty ones and finding a Justice on his own way! I know a lot of people don't like this movie that is fine but is 1.000.000 times way better to seeing this flick than watching the new Keanu Reeves movie Knock Knock! The mystery the acting and the action in this movie is outstanding!Street Kings is possibly one of the best cop thrillers in years since the likes of The Departed Training Day Dark Blue and To Live and Die in L.A.! Keanu Reeves gives a very strong performance as a veteran L.A. detective who is struggling with his conscience as he deals with both delivering brutal street justice and mourning the death of his wife. Oscar winner Forest Whitaker gives another strong performance as Keanu's hardnosed boss whose duties include keeping Keanu within the confines of the law and out of the clutches of Internal Affairs. Hugh Laurie TV's House was a real surprise in the movie as he plays the captain of Internal Affairs who is out to bring down corruption in the force particularly amongst the Vice Squad which includes Keanu Whitaker and a couple of appearances by Jay Mohr and John Corbett. And Chris Evans Captain America The Winter Soldier gives a very convincing performance as a young detective who teams up with Keanu after evidence implicates the latter in the death of his expartner.This movie is filed with a lot of action and twists although some were predictable it kept me interested to the end. Keanu Reeves played a good part along with Forest Whitaker who always gives a top notch performance. It is a fun flick specially if you are Keanu Reeves fan or you like the actor. This movie was pretty good. I enjoyed it very much. great cast. good story. I know this type of Bad cop movie has been done before in different ways. Keanu Reeves did a way better job as a cop in Street Kings then he did an architect in Knock Knock. Very believable. Great camera and makeup work. there was a good part in this movie were you can feel how cold the streets could be. But for the most part it was very predictable. In this movie are two rappers in here that both plays different characters and they did a good job on acting. Even some people would not agree with me. Common as corrupt LAPD deputy masquerading as Coates and The Game as Grill. I think both did a good job playing their roles. Street Kings got a also a sequel which it sucked ass! Both of the roles Keanu Reeves passed in the sequels Speed and Street Kings. Because he knew it was a bad idea and the sequels will be a failure and they really were.Tom Ludlow Keanu Reeves is a veteran LAPD cop who finds life difficult to navigate after the death of his wife. When evidence implicates him in the execution of a fellow officer he is forced to go up against the cop culture he's been a part of his entire life. This is Keanu Reeves that I love and not his role in Knock Knock this movie kicks ass!!!!!! And I don't care if you put down this review I stand by my morals of a Keanu Reeves fan boy and I love an action films that he made! I am giving this movie 1010 it is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves best action thriller.".

	schema:reviewBody "Street Kings definitely has the streetcred. Keanu looks real badass Forrest Whittaker looks like he's digging back into the character he played on The Shield writer director David Ayer is no stranger to life on the cop circuit having written Dark Blue and Training Day among others and the movie also brings on the token rappers for good measure in Common and The Game. But does it work? Reeves plays Tom Ludlow a Vice detective on a Special Forces unit in LA led by Ludlow's friend and former partner Captain Wander Forrest Whittaker. Ludlow's a dirty cop but he feels in a good way. He'll execute and then tweak the crime scene if it means taking the lowlifes off the streets for good.His former partner Terrance Washington Terry Crews doesn't see it that way though as he is in the midst of ratting him out to the head of Internal Affairs Captain Biggs Hugh Laurie. When he finds out Tom follows Washington around walking right into a convenience store robbery where Washington is gunned down execution style. Wander tells Tom he'll take care of it but Tom is a man who values justice more than anything. He partners with a homicide detective named Diskant Chris Evans to follow the evidence and solve the murder.The movie by David Ayer couldn't be more hardcore. It's filled with riveting gunbattles and fights and it's a movie not afraid to show some real brutal violence and blood. The verbal exchanges between characters are also exceptionally written heated and intense with a good ear for dialogue. My favorite line by far this year is Why don't you do the department a favor and clean your mouth out with a buckshot. And the story pulls off a compelling morality play sending Tom up a ladder of murder and corruption and at the same time climbing him further toward his own redemption. Sure you can probably see the ending coming if your paying close enough attention but think about it the movie couldn't end in a better way.This is the kind of movie Reeves is excellent in giving his character edge and toughness but also never losing track of the character's underlying moral dilemma. Whittaker is also incredible in this movie sinking his teeth into a character who's basically portrayed as The Godfather of LA. Hugh Laurie shows up every once in a while the character feels underwritten though. Chris Evans does a decent job Cedric The Entertainer and Jay Mohr are nice additions who add some comedy and it's a small role but Naomie Harris deserves a shoutout for playing the downtoearth voice of reason character.Street Kings is hardnosed gritty filmmaking. The cast is right on the money the writing and direction is terrific and the action couldn't be more exciting. The year is still young but this is one of my favorite films so far.".

	onyx:emotionText "Street Kings definitely has the streetcred. Keanu looks real badass Forrest Whittaker looks like he's digging back into the character he played on The Shield writer director David Ayer is no stranger to life on the cop circuit having written Dark Blue and Training Day among others and the movie also brings on the token rappers for good measure in Common and The Game. But does it work? Reeves plays Tom Ludlow a Vice detective on a Special Forces unit in LA led by Ludlow's friend and former partner Captain Wander Forrest Whittaker. Ludlow's a dirty cop but he feels in a good way. He'll execute and then tweak the crime scene if it means taking the lowlifes off the streets for good.His former partner Terrance Washington Terry Crews doesn't see it that way though as he is in the midst of ratting him out to the head of Internal Affairs Captain Biggs Hugh Laurie. When he finds out Tom follows Washington around walking right into a convenience store robbery where Washington is gunned down execution style. Wander tells Tom he'll take care of it but Tom is a man who values justice more than anything. He partners with a homicide detective named Diskant Chris Evans to follow the evidence and solve the murder.The movie by David Ayer couldn't be more hardcore. It's filled with riveting gunbattles and fights and it's a movie not afraid to show some real brutal violence and blood. The verbal exchanges between characters are also exceptionally written heated and intense with a good ear for dialogue.

	schema:reviewBody "Synopsis Tom Ludlow Keanu Reeves a veteran LAPD Detective works in a Special Vice Squad Unit in Los Angeles. Ludlow has been suffering from depression since his wife died. On top of that his former partner Detective Terrance Washington Terry Crews is murdered by two gang members. Ludlow goes on a wild and reckless quest through the mean streets of Los Angeles to track them down and get justice for Washington. Captain Jack Wander Forest Whitaker is Ludlow's supervisor who must keep him from going over the edge and out of the crosshairs of Internal Affairs Captain James Biggs Hugh Laurie.My Comment Keanu Reeves and Forest Whitaker were excellent in playing their parts. In the first 10 minutes we get to see how good Ludlow is in using his guns. The movie races at such a fast pace and it is so intense at times that you don't know who is the good guy or the bad guy. There are some great shootout scenes and whatever you do don't get in Ludlow's way because he will take you out. Usually the police have this cop culture of protecting each other. After they imply that Ludlow had something to do with the murder of Detective Washington he begins to question his loyalty to his fellow officers especially when they hang him out to dry. At that point the movie gets real interesting. The only problem I had with the script was that it put the tough cop Ludlow in a gloomy mood the whole movie. I would have preferred him to be a cop with selfcontrol and strength of mind. If you enjoy cop dramas you will like this one because it has so many twists and turns and back stabbing to keep you interested and wanting more. You will love some of Ludlow's interrogation techniques of the bad guys. Fox Searchlight Run Time 149 Rated R810".

The plot is compelling engaging and keeps developing and while I had a hunch about one twist I did not see them all coming. This has spoton pacing not a boring second to be found or an overwhelming one for that matter. The cinematography and editing are excellent throughout. Every moment of the action is awesome intense and exciting without being unrealisticwithin the bounds of Hollywood that is... which if going by this is actually entirely acceptable and there is a solid and fitting amount of it. The music is appropriate for where this is set not to mention really cool consisting mainly of hardcore rap. As you can probably figure out the tone of this is brutal dark and gritty through and through and should not be viewed by anyone who may not be able to take it. The writing is astounding the script the dialog the overall story all of it. There is a lot of slangthe subtitles certainly helped me out and some instantly memorable and utterly quotable lines. Almost all of the humor which is also very roughand the amount of which is considerable lies in what is said how it's put andor its delivery think verbal British comedywith fourletter words. The characters are distinguished credible and psychologically accurate with no real exceptions and while there is a heavy dose of machoism and bloated egossome bits are soaked in and dripping testosterone it never gets ludicrous and there are several characters who help keep it grounded in their more agreeable personalities. I think it is also notable that this beyond a sequence lasting no longer than a few seconds this does not at any point stoop to the lowest common denominator and try to appease and appeal to the young male demographic by simple parading something to gawk at. This isn't denying the existence of such it just has nothing gratuitous in the way of it other than aforementioned brief part. The acting is magnificent for basically every partI owe Evans a heartfelt apology the guy can actually do great work and be pretty badass Reeves is believable and Whitaker performs well in everything required of him in this. Both Laurie and Mohr honestly if you didn't know they usually go for making people laugh you wouldn't know from this they're straightfaced and professional all the wayand I'm not saying they're not funny in this. There is plenty of disturbing content and a ton of strong violence and language in this. The DVD holds an interesting director's commentary a handful of informative featurettes deleted scene with the option of hearing Ayer's thoughts on themby the way David if I may call you that I promise you you put another movie up on the silver screen and I will almost without a doubt go to the cinema to catch it when it comes out alternate takes and vignettesreally short documentaries. All of them are well worth the time. I recommend this to fans of the people involved in making it as well as of the genres and those who want to watch pictures set in this environment. 810".

Now the conclusion shouldn't be at ANY surprise to anyone in the audience who's at least seen ONE other work by James Ellroy the film's cowriter.What does give it just a bit of extra lift is the extreme quality of the conclusion how things seem so ridiculous that in any other hands this would be total nonsense. David Ayer the director and writer of Training Day the perennial new millennium corruptcop saga does have a good handle on the material though even with hambone performance Forest Whitaker is one of them sadly as he basically retreads his persona from The Last King of Scotland as the King of the corrupt cops. There is some not too shabby work like a nearly phonedinfromHouse performance from Hugh Laurie not unappreciated if you are a House fan but it's mostly from supporting players like Jay Mohr in odd mustache and Common the rapper as one of the 'thugs'. It all kind of blends together as a pulpy orange of a B movie good for something to not ponder too long over but not as horrible as you might expect for a genre piece. It's a flavor of the season.".

The film stands in the shadow of the like of Training Day 2001 but has enough punch with bloody hard hitting scenes to stand on its own. It's probably on par with the comparable Dark Blue 2002 Ayer incidentally wrote the screenplay but unavoidably falls into the trappings of the genre. Ayer's is wise to use a predominately on location shoot and portray graphic violence to give credence and weight to the proceedings. As Ludlow is set up and goes about uncovering a deeper conspiracy screenplay writers the profound James Ellroy and underrated Kurt Wimmer successfully dot i's and cross the t's crafting a satisfying if somewhat predictable tale. The ending emulates the feeling of the closing of Dirty Harry 1971. Always topical and prevalent I suppose you can never have too many films which highlight the pitfalls of greed and corruption.

	schema:headline " I'm already packedStreet Kings";
	schema:reviewBody "What I love about David Ayer's work is that he is unpredictable and unafraid to tell a story in all its brutality. From his penned script Training Day to his directorial debut in Harsh Times we are treated with bad men and worse men doing what they need to survive and not worrying about the consequences. When I saw the trailer for his new film Street Kings I thought I'd be in for a threepeat but I should have looked at the writing credits. Don't get me wrong I like James Ellroy and Kurt Wimmer I enjoy much of their work however knowing Ayer's catalog makes me believe that it was their fault why I did not love this film. The aesthetic is there the language is there and the violence is never shied away from but the story itself never surprises. You will be able to see what will happen straight from the getgo and unfortunately that just isn't what I'm used to seeing with Ayer. I expected more and hopefully for his next film he won't go gunforhire and write his own new urban street tale.Don't be fooled by the trailer this is not a story about a corrupt cop on his day to day jaunts busting heads and covering his tracks. It's about the good cop that has lost his faith while he may go against the rules he will only do it for the right reasons he hasn't gone completely off the deep end. No it's those around him that are lost and he must find two cop killers when everyone just wants to let it go in order to save his skin. True he wants the cover up to keep his job but he also wants justice for his expartner a man he began to dislike but a man he loved and would not let die in vain. In effect then we are treated to a much slower paced plot then you may want as he goes out on his own to solve the case off the books. More a straightforward cop drama then a crazy shootemup we are shown this one story thread through to its inevitable conclusion. It's all tidied up with a bow villains explain the whole plan like the old clich goes and we get closure. Ayer you aren't supposed to be so cut and dry what happened? Being such a by the numbers tale also means sacrificing a lot of character development. Roles like Naomie Harris' are throwaways putting a name actress in a small part with no real substance. The same goes for Hugh Laurie third billed and quite entertaining but does his Captain Biggs have any real need to be there? You could have put any guy off the street in that role and it would have served its purpose as a MacGuffin to be explained later. And how about Common? The guy owns his five minutes of screen time it's just a shame that is all he is allowed. Not to mention John Corbett who doesn't even get a billing on IMDb now that's just strange.The acting is great overall though. Forest Whitaker is a bit too showy for me but I love the guy so I give him a pass Chris Evans is topnotch as usual hopefully a true breakthrough role is coming for him and Jay Mohr comes out of nowhere playing the aged Sgt. without any of his trademark wit. Even Cedric the Entertainer comes in shedding any comedic preconceptions. He plays his notsobad thug sounding like Terrance Howard in Hustle and Flow I was shockingly impressed. The guy that holds it all together though is Keanu Reeves. I know people hate the guy but I think he is solidly perfect here. He has the dejection and death sentence look about him taking the kills for himself so that his partners don't have to live with the guilt. He knows what he does is wrong but he does it because he believes he has to. Sometimes to keep the city safe you have to bend the rules. Reeves looks weathered and beatdown here totally believable as the cop looking to do right despite his actions. Real good stuff.So well directed and well acted but yet not that great? Doesn't seem to make sense yet that's my feeling. All the good stuff tries to overcompensate for the generic lackluster story. One thing about cinema thoughand maybe the writers strike was worth it even though those wanting the strike for more money were mostly the hacks the true auteurs already get the casha good script overcomes all and a bad one cannot be saved. Unfortunately this one never goes that extra mile to be completely unique and the performances just fall into place when necessary rather than enhancing to bring the tale to new heights. If you haven't seen it yet go rent Harsh Times save this one for a rental in a few months instead.".

	schema:headline " Kings of Crap";
	schema:reviewBody "Street Kings is an overthetop unrealistic portrayal of corruption within the police force. Setting it in LA is the only way to make a film with such ambition of distorting reality even possible. LA is heavily diverse with all kinds of people which is a good backdrop for racism and more importantly racist cops. LAPD is also a place where the police have been scrutinized and publicly shamed for involvement in corruption that resorts anywhere from murder to police brutality to not paying for coffee. And in the one track mind of David Ayer who hit it big with Training Day which was a much better film but also terribly flawed as well just can't seem to get away from showing cops in a extremely negative light. Here he basically rips off his own film again see Harsh Times. The good thing about Training Day was Ethan Hawke's character. He was a good cop under the wing of a corrupt cop. There was a good and evil battle there. Keanu Reeves is supposed to be that good guy but he's a veteran of 18 years and he has quite a history of corruption. Right from the first scene of the film he's puking because naturally he's an alcoholic due to the death of his wife. A lot of cops are alcoholics so it's only natural for the main character once again to be an alcoholic in a David Ayers film. Then he goes and buys little airplane bottles of Vodka three of them chugs them down then proceeds to make a routine sell to a couple of Asians who are looking to buy a Machine gun. These Chinese Or whatever they are are the guys he's looking for in a kidnapping of two missing persons. Ludlow Reeves goes on a racist tirade about their looks and then they follow that up by beating the crap out of him. Only then does he tack them down and kill them all. That's what he does He kills people. No warning no police procedure of any kind he's merely a vigilantly with a badge a cowboy in the mold of Jon Wayne.The writing in this film is terrible. It's not even close to realistic and it paints a picture of corrupt cops who own the streets through fear and intimidation they act the same way as the criminals do. Oh you've seen that done before? Naturally you come across guys who cover up set up spree kill kill other cops get involved in drugs and pretty much any kind of corruption you can think of in about a span of five days. This is made routine in an Ayers film which was okay the first time around. Now it's getting out of hand and it makes his previous films look even worse because we now see where Ayers wants to take this subject No where. Ayers packs years and years of police corruption into weekend retreats as if it's an everyday routine A casual drug deal here an everyday spree killing there and the usual torturething over here. This stereotypical technique of painting all cops evil is not unlike Training Day or Harsh Times where reality is not needed. You don't notice how bad of a writer someone is until they prove to you that they can't create a character that's threedimensional or more importantly different. Ayers can't provide drama. He has to put his characters in the most extreme circumstance every five minutes because when he doesn't his films get boring with tedious everyday interactions that just don't work because they're not in any way shape or form realistic. If these cops aren't corrupt they're aspiring to be corrupt. The forgettable cast and the forgettable plot will probably leave smarter audience members with the same feeling I had. If I could tell Ayers something I would tell him this Stop beating your stupid message that corruption exists within the police force to ad nausea levels that only a Paul Haggis could rival!! Stop it!! You don't like cops! Great got the picture. Ayers showed promise as a writer. Now he shows that he can't come up with a single original idea as his films stand on clichs coincidence and exaggeration. He adds nothing new that hasn't already been done even by him. Street Kings depends on coincidence to drive the plot such as a chase scene where a suspect runs through the neighborhood as Ludlow drives around the streets to find him I think I've seen that before and if Ayers makes another movie I bet I see it again. Naturally Ludlow is waiting for him and he throws something at his legs looked like a chair I wasn't paying much attention since I already knew what was going to happen which takes the suspect off his feet as he falls into a barbed wire fence. This will also give Ludlow the opportunity to torture him by pulling him against the wire so it cuts into his skin. The man pleads for help as he thrives in pain then gives in. Ludlow get's his answers. Not a single original idea is created. It's a work of dreadful perfection. The acting is bad the direction is bad and the writing is so bad it should have never been written let alone pitched read and then made. How did Forest Whitaker get himself involved in this? It's hard to even imagine his performance from The Shield compared to this hammed up pay check cashing snooze fest. Of course he wasn't out done by Keanu Reeves and that one guy who pops in mediocre roles for some odd reason in big budget films. That dude's best acting performance came in Not Another Teen Movie. Maybe you remember him? No? Me neither. They both were upstaged by Whitaker which shows that Forest can be a better actor than Reeves and the other guy without even trying or at least he doesn't look to be trying.".

	onyx:emotionText "Street Kings is an overthetop unrealistic portrayal of corruption within the police force. Setting it in LA is the only way to make a film with such ambition of distorting reality even possible. LA is heavily diverse with all kinds of people which is a good backdrop for racism and more importantly racist cops. LAPD is also a place where the police have been scrutinized and publicly shamed for involvement in corruption that resorts anywhere from murder to police brutality to not paying for coffee.

	schema:reviewBody "So I continue my foray into the theatrical releases this week as a break from the Festival proceedings and choosing Street Kings is a no brainer. It was in Speed that Keanu Reeves donned a Kevlar vest and a devil may care attitude to save a speeding bus from annihilation and after that he's gone on to other blockbusters such as the Matrix trilogy and countless of other romance movies. Here he revisits that action genre as a cop with questionable morals and while some may gripe over his acting ability I thought that he was given a role totally within his range  that of a clueless gunslinger who's caught up in a web of intrigue far greater than he can fathom.Based on a story James Ellroy who gave us L.A. Confidential and Black Dahlia we continue the tale about corrupt cop culture and with director David Ayer at the helm who delivered Harsh Times and wrote Training Day there's some amount of credibility and expectation with these two powerhouses collaborating and from my previous enjoyment of their earlier movies thankfully Street Kings delivered spot on with hard hitting uncompromising action coupled with violence without remorse and a deep undercurrent brewing on the political angle within the police department as well.We get introduced to Reeves' Detective Tom Ludlow of the LAPD who in the first 10 minutes we witness a classic Dirty Harry styled cop who lets his guns do the talking and employs questionable tactics in getting the job done. And he gets off the hook easy because of his sterling reputation and no doubt being given special treatment and protection from his direct boss Captain Jack Wander Forest Whitaker. Naturally it gets slowly revealed that the entire police team has plenty of skeletons in the closet and while Wander may be the patriarch of the force politicking his way to more power he has his enforcer Ludlow at his side to straighten things up.And with corrupt cops come the probe by Internal Affairs and here's where things start to get interesting with potential moles and doubtful loyalties being thrown around and in the midst of it all is severe corruption that it's nearly impossible to try and trust anyone around more so when Chris Evan's Detective Paul Diskant gets thrown into the fray to investigate a case against Ludlow. For those who enjoy cop dramas you'll be in for a real treat with the twists and turns betrayals and double crossings and when it comes down to the crunch out comes the guns.But more importantly it allows us to question just how much are we willing to sacrifice our moral ground especially when revealing the truth will put us in bad light or get us into trouble and we're talking about trouble with a capital T where innate selfpreservation instincts will take over if we do not consciously make a conscientious decision to come clean. We can cover up get people to cover up or better yet have someone in power to cover it up for you but that only means you get sucked into a system and it will continue to breed within you for the worse.Street Kings is excellent stuff that blew me away caution Fan Boy mode is on and the ending sure is one of a kind with the usual soliloquy but one that really made you think on both sides of the equation  what one would do and say in order to save oneself and how one can lie straight into the eye of another. It's classic black eat black showing how deep the rot has permeated and the ending just demonstrates that sometimes unorthodox methods work but with a caution that there are always more powerful people out there who play others like pawns on a chessboard. Besides it was nice to see Forest Whitaker getting into the rough and tumble of things after a rather docile role in Vantage Point.".

The scenes of Tom going around town with his guns vodka and unchangeable expression is not only accompanied by clich standardactionmovie music the type you start to notice after a few minutes and bugs you for the rest of the time but also by some of the worst dialogues I've seen moviecharacters have. Rivaled maybe by King Arthur's horrible attempts to sound historical and philosophical at the same time but at least that movie had proper actors and good exciting action in it. It also didn't have the uselessness of the plot that 'Street Kings' does possess. At the end of the movie nothing is solved for good Tom Ludlow'll still be depressed and the viewer is left with that same emotion and a sort of 'Ok sooo....?'unsatisfied feeling. And after a last look at Tom Ludlow staring at the setting sun exactly like Reeves honestly man even Neo managed a subtle change every now and then! stared at everything else in the movie the credits start to roll. Thank you David Ayer for making cops look corrupt and Reeves look untalented for a movie with exactly one line I managed to laugh at and please Hugh Laurie focus yourself on making more Houseepisodes for us to enjoy...!".

For instance whilst Bruce Willis gives a solid performance as lowlife private eye Joe Hallenbeck we have seen the act a dozen times.  There are remnants of Die Hard's John McClane in every knowing smirk and pained cigarette inhalation.  Equally Tony Scott's direction is still based on an obsession with placing bright lights behind the actors and turning up the volume of car chases and gunshots.  Jimmy Dix the faded football hero is given a suitably comic persona by Damon Wayons and the action sequences are as good as you will find elsewhere in Hollywood.  However these are not the attractions of the film for me.You might think from what is written above that I disliked the film but you would be mistaken to think that as I believe it to be an absolute classic of its kind.  I truly think The Last Boy Scout should be used as a teaching tool at film schools the world over.  In spite of its glaring limitations it is a movie that has everything!  The opening scene is a modern movie classic  up there with those of Raiders Of The Lost Ark and Goodfellas.  If there is a filmgoer alive whose mouth didn't gape in wonderous amusement at the climax to the opening scene then I am amazed. The plot as far fetched as it is provides a perfect vehicle for the key elements that go towards making this the gem of a movie that it is.First in the list of key elements is the wonderfully funny dialogue. Shane Black's hallmark of snappy oneliners is all over the sizzling repartee between the two heroes.  Even Hallenbeck's daughter gets a couple of laughoutloud lines.  Secondly the story benefits from the ideal combination of sport gambling violence comedy the odd topless dancer important values of family and friendship revenge and honour.  Take out the topless dancer and they pretty much all feature in The Godfather!The third crucial component for the success of The Last Boy Scout is the perfect casting of the bad guys.  Milo played to chilling perfection by Taylor Negron is a bad guy with a difference.  He isn't just a mindless hard man.  His brilliantly annoying habit of calling people by their elongated names is a superb touch Joe becomes Joseph Jimmy becomes James and so on as are his attempts at civility when trying to do a formal introduction with the kidnapped Hallenbeck.  Other bad guys are fleshed out and distinguished by quirky traits or funny lines.  They are not merely there to make the good guys look good.Overall this film is not a piece of celluloid art.  It is however a perfect example of popcornfriendly entertainment.  It is the sort of movie you imagine the makers would like to see as moviegoers themselves. Without being utterly contemptible or mindlessly lowbrow it entertains.  An ideal Saturday night movie to watch with a group of friends.".

In his review of the film Roger Ebert gave it three stars but not without citing it's misogynistic and degrading qualities. True enough it's not a pretty picture people are beaten shot and maimed in all sorts of ways women are slapped around and degraded a 13year old girl cusses is cussed at has a gun pointed at her temple by her own father and is put in the path of thugs.Despite all that I enjoy watching the film but not for any of the above qualities. The movie has an energy and a chemistry between the two leads Willis and Wayans that is missing from most action films. Shane Black's screenplay is full of hilarious gems see the Quotes section. There's a freeway scene where our heroes attempt to alert someone of a bomb. Wayans pulls out a pen and paper and draws a picture. Willis replied That doesn't look like a bomb it looks like an apple with lines coming out of it! They're gonna say don't open the briefcase it's full of fresh fruit! Wayans spells out BOM and shows the paper to the person they're after only to have the person fire a shot at them. Willis replies I meant to tell you bomb means 'fk you' in Polish. It's a scene that represents the comic timing of the film.Of course the nastiness of the film is what most remember about it. There's a good amount of foul language and an even greater amount of graphic violence the villain meets a really gruesome end. And of course women aren't spared in this one. The relationship between Willis and his estranged wife is one of friction when he catches his best friend with her he pulls out a gun and shoots hitting their wedding photo. And at the end as the two reunite he embraces her and whispers profanity in her ear not the most loving sentiment.The bottom line this isn't really a film for the faint of heart. It's a rough film as it almost should be. The easily offended might consider something lighter and fluffier. All others might consider giving this film a shot.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been 14 years since Tony Scott's The Last Boyscout was released and it was not a major hit at the box office.Too bad.Still this guilty pleasure is one of funniest action movies ever made. The movie starts with the rocky and cheesy theme Friday Night is A Great Night For Football sung by Bill Medley. You can't top that way to begin a movie. But then Scott surprises us again. the opening sequence where a football player is going to use any way possible to score a touchdown is breath taking too. Enter Joe Hallenback Willis and Jimmy Dix Wayans two fallen heroes. One a detective the other an ex pro of the Stallion's league. The mob is there too gamble money bets a murdered young girl and big explosions. All of this wrapped up in a great story which I won't spoil. This film is one of Tarantino's favorites. It's full of one liners and classic scenes. Violent and graphic. Touch me again and I kill you... says Willis' character to one of the gangsters. You should see the result. Written by Shane Black Lethal Weapon you've got a guarantee you're going to have a great time. Taylor Negron is great as Milo the villain a young and beautiful Halle Berry is Kory a girl that knows too much the sexy Chelsea Field is Hallenback's wife and Danielle Harris is her daughter a great characters that nearly steals the show.This is not an art movie.

	onyx:emotionText "It's been 14 years since Tony Scott's The Last Boyscout was released and it was not a major hit at the box office.Too bad.Still this guilty pleasure is one of funniest action movies ever made. The movie starts with the rocky and cheesy theme Friday Night is A Great Night For Football sung by Bill Medley. You can't top that way to begin a movie. But then Scott surprises us again. the opening sequence where a football player is going to use any way possible to score a touchdown is breath taking too. Enter Joe Hallenback Willis and Jimmy Dix Wayans two fallen heroes. One a detective the other an ex pro of the Stallion's league. The mob is there too gamble money bets a murdered young girl and big explosions. All of this wrapped up in a great story which I won't spoil. This film is one of Tarantino's favorites. It's full of one liners and classic scenes. Violent and graphic. Touch me again and I kill you... says Willis' character to one of the gangsters. You should see the result. Written by Shane Black Lethal Weapon you've got a guarantee you're going to have a great time. Taylor Negron is great as Milo the villain a young and beautiful Halle Berry is Kory a girl that knows too much the sexy Chelsea Field is Hallenback's wife and Danielle Harris is her daughter a great characters that nearly steals the show.This is not an art movie. It's pure entertainment an excellent flick. Is anything better than that?";

	schema:reviewBody "The Last Boy Scout is without a doubt one of the greatest action movies ever made. There is nothing a good action film needs that isn't woven into Tony Scott's vision of Shane Black's screenplay. We have shootouts.... lots and lots of shootouts. We have Bruce Willis. We have football. We have some beautiful women at our disposal. There are some fast cars. There are drugs. And the profanityladen dialog is so wellwritten that virtually the entire script can be read in the memorable quotes section of this site.Our story though completely preposterous has some real depth. We have multidimensional characters and we are taken on quite a ride with them as the action unfolds. Bruce Willis plays a burned out private investigator who helps a disgraced former pro football player solve the murder of his girlfriend. Before our story ends we have a dirty US senator a greedy football team owner and about a hundred seedy henchmen thrown into the mix. Things move so quickly that only towards the end does one of our characters actually speak a line that sums up how ridiculous it all is. Damon Wayans who plays the former football star gives Willis some sobering insight. He points out that Willis must be one of the dumbest people alive. He is not only trying to save the life of the man who ruined his career but also trying to avenge the death of the man who was fking his wife! But somehow we the audience care about the outcome and getting there couldn't be more fun.The film has dated fairly well up to this point. Being as though it came out in 1991 you can still see a high top fade on a black character or two. The football uniforms have changed a little too but these are minor things that take nothing away from the enjoyment of the story. Water is still wet the sky is still blue and this is still one hell of a movie...and then some!!! This film scores a perfect 10 of 10 stars. It couldn't have been made any better.So sayeth the Hound.".

There's no way to choose between a melon and a steak  one is a main course another is dessert. Now then all I gotta say on the actual movie is an excellent specie of a purely commercial entertainment for grownups with a lot of kid stuff inside. The advantages and limitations of the genre  which is your typical action with a twist of comedy  are played on beautifully by the great action hero who IMHO is also much more than that Bruce Willis with his usual charisma and selfirony. Damon Wanes gives a very decent even if a bit afroamericancomedyclub stereotype performance every note is in it's rightful place though he is not as yet the actor we know from Bamboozled. Danielle Harris is easygoing natural and convincing as a teen daughter of the Last Boyscout. Chelsea Field is a bit shallow in this your standard wife. I think the role needed more soulsearching. Taylor Negrin was too cartoony for my taste a bit over the top so didn't affect me as scary which was obviously intended. The screenplay is fast alive and has a good balance of dramacomedy without rubbing our faces in either. Tony Scott keeps it interesting with his very own and unique visual style. On the whole  a highly enjoyable quality entertainment. WATCH IT  HAVE FUN!".

Damon Wayans was funny but he also fared well when it was time to do a serious scene. I still laugh at the scene where Jimmy claims that Joe has to be the dumbest man on planet Earth because Joe is trying to solve the murder of the same best friend who slept with his wife.

	schema:reviewBody "The Last Boy Scout is set in Los Angeles where Joe Hallenebeck Bruce Willis works as a private detective Joe gets a call from his best friend  fellow private detective Mike Matthews Bruce McGill offering him a job protecting a stripper named Cory Halle Berry. Later that morning Joe discovers that Mike is having an affair with his wife Sarah Chelsea Field but still accepts the job since he needs the cash while keeping an eye on Cory he is attacked  knocked out  Cory is shot dead in front of her ex profootball player boyfriend Jimmy Dix Damon Wayans. Affter being let go by the cops Joe  Jimmy team up to find out the truth behind Cory's murder  they discover a plot to legalise sports gambling  an attempt to assassinate a US senator. Up to their necks in trouble with people trying to kill them left right  center as well as the cops after them Joe  Jimmy decide to save the day  take the bad guy's down...Directed by Tony Scott I will openly  freely admit that I have a real soft spot for The Last Boy Scout I just think it's almost perfect at what it sets out to do  I find it a very entertaining film to just sit down  watch. I must have seen The Last Boy Scout a dozen times or so over the years  it never fails to entertain or make me laugh  there's not many films out there I can say that about for instance I recently saw FaceOff 1997 again for the first time in years  I was extremely disappointed by how dull it was  that it just wasn't anywhere near as good I remembered it but watching The Last Boy Scout again last night it was definitely every bit as good as I remember it from when I first saw it all those years ago. There are several reasons why I like The Last Boy Scout so much for a start it's one of those infinitely quotable films full of filthy foul mouth oneliners that are genuinely funny  never fail to at least raise a smile. The action is very violent  at times maybe a little too much emphasis is given on hurting people but the setpieces which include car chases shootouts fights  explosions are fun  varied enough to stand out. The plot is a little weak  the main story about a corrupt senator  a businessman trying to legalise gambling is a bit lacklustre but the character's really make it work. Joe Hallenbeck the down on his luck bitter  cynical detective is great as the hero he has his flaws but that's good  you do end up really liking the guy by the end of the flick while the Jimmy Dix character is a more clichd black partner to bounce jokes off type of guy but he holds his own  he too also becomes rather likable by the end although he never seems that upset about witnessing the love of his life Cory get viciously gunned down in front of him. The Last Boy Scout is a mix of some of the best bits  ideas from classic action flicks like Beverly Hills Cop 1984 Lethal Weapon 1987  Die Hard 1988 but that's no bad thing I mean if your going to steal you might as well steal from the best right? The bad guy's aren't that good or overly memorable but nothings perfect I suppose.The films pace is a little slow to start with but the funny oneliners come thick  fast to keep one entertained. The violence is often excessive  there's a lot of killing punching  general hurting of people. The action scenes are fairly well done although I am not sure how a car ends up falling straight down into a pool when it clearly has forward momentum as it launched itself off the roof of a house. The film is full of profanity  bad language so if you don't like swearing The Last Boy Scout is not the film for you although I never got the impression that it was swearing for the sake of swearing  most of the profanity is very funny. Apparently the original script was quite different as the entire last third of the film was to be set on water  Hallenbeck's grudge again the senator who was the President in the original script was different  the senator's son Louis who isn't even in the final shooting script was to be one of the main villains.Obviously blessed with a decent budget the production values are high  it's well made. Apparently music composer Michael Kamen hated The Last Boy Scout when he first saw it  only wrote  provided the score for it because of his personal friendship with Bruce Willis  producer Joel Silver. Bruce Willis is a likable guy  he was just born to lay these foul mouthed wisecracking hero types  puts in a great performance here while his buddy buddy partner Damon Wayans does fine too although I think a young Danielle Harris is also great as Joe's foul mouth daughter with an attitude.The Last Boy Scout is a real guilty pleasure from the 90's that holds up extremely well even today it's go some great action some hilarious oneliners that are guaranteed to have you quoting them to your mates  Bruce Willis probably the best action film star of recent times  any film that kills off the supremely untalented Halle Berry has got something going for it.".

Apparently the original script was quite different as the entire last third of the film was to be set on water  Hallenbeck's grudge again the senator who was the President in the original script was different  the senator's son Louis who isn't even in the final shooting script was to be one of the main villains.Obviously blessed with a decent budget the production values are high  it's well made. Apparently music composer Michael Kamen hated The Last Boy Scout when he first saw it  only wrote  provided the score for it because of his personal friendship with Bruce Willis  producer Joel Silver. Bruce Willis is a likable guy  he was just born to lay these foul mouthed wisecracking hero types  puts in a great performance here while his buddy buddy partner Damon Wayans does fine too although I think a young Danielle Harris is also great as Joe's foul mouth daughter with an attitude.The Last Boy Scout is a real guilty pleasure from the 90's that holds up extremely well even today it's go some great action some hilarious oneliners that are guaranteed to have you quoting them to your mates  Bruce Willis probably the best action film star of recent times  any film that kills off the supremely untalented Halle Berry has got something going for it.";

	schema:headline " The last of the great eighties action flicks...and the quintessential Bruce Willis hero";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the perfect film to demonstrate why Bruce Willis is still an action star to this day. In my opinion his machismo is second only to Clint Eastwood himself. Willis is kickbutt and always has been but he always proved it in gritty witty exploding wicked action flicks and The Last Boy Scout gives us his perfect action hero which is kind of an amalgamation of all his other heroes. On top of that director Tony Scott knows how to tell a good story amidst gun fire and explosions possibly better than anyone else although I feel he has stumbled a few times with the likes of the deplorable Domino. But that was later in his career this was when he was flying high and it shows. The movie has plenty of everything you'd want from the perfect action flick Bruce Willis wise cracking side kick explosions gun fights kidnappings undercover work a good solid mystery car chases and so on. The movie is gritty and slick and fun to watch. It's almost too dark to really do itself justice but it is still a wicked good time. Scott takes what could be a run of the mill action flick and gives it edge gives it purpose and makes the most of a solid cast too.As I said before Bruce Willis is the best of all versions of himself...or rather his heroes. His wise cracking cigarette smoking John McLean of Die Hard but then he's also estranged from his family especially his daughter whom he loves dearly but hides it he's a washed up alcoholic private detective who was once a secret service agent that saved the President until an over zealous bad Politician ruins him. How great a character is that for an action flick? Willis is perfect to look rough and tired and constantly ticked off and still give the perfect one liners and no matter how mean and cranky he is you root for him every minute. Damon Wayans is really the perfect balance in the film to Willis' character. Wayan's is the wisecracking side kick who ends up working with Willis much to his dismay but become the best of friends...again the perfect action flick mix. Wayan's character reminds me very much of a more athletic and crack addicted version of Eddie Murphy's Axel Foley...coincidence? Tony Scott directed Beverly Hills Cop 2 four years earlier. Wayans and Willis make an unusual team and yet they are terrific together. Halle Berry makes a small appearance in a role as Wayan's girlfriend and a major point in the entire mystery. Her role is graciously small I'm not a huge fan. Chelsea Field and Danielle Harris are Willis' wife and daughter. Field's is decent but doesn't get a lot of screen time but Danielle Harris is really something as his feisty foul mouthed daughter. She's perfect for the part.The Last Boy Scout has a very interesting plot and a really in depth mystery that unfolds very well as each piece of the puzzle falls into place but for an action movie I felt like it was missing a key element. The villain. Yes there are bad guys and there is a main mob boss who they are trying to take down ultimately but he's not at the forefront of the story really. He's not as much of an adversary as an annoyance that they try to take down. I would just like to have seen more connection between Willis Wayan's and the boss played decently by Noble Willingham. As with any action film you have to suspend a certain amount of belief but the last scene of The Last Boy Scout has always really annoyed me. It's not cool as much at is just a shade too much to swallow. It involves a football being thrown to block a bullet. Nonetheless you won't stop being entertained with the intelligent story and terrific performances by the buddies Willis and Wayans who work great together. I think if they wanted to they could have serialized this but it didn't do well enough apparently. I think it happens to be one of the more intelligent action flicks with plenty of everything you love and a good story to boot. Definitely check it out!! 8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie three times in the theater with a buddy of mine when we were still in high school. Yes Three Times! And it got better each time I saw it. Before too long I could recite every line spoken by Bruce Willis in the movie because at one point Willis was my hero. I even copied his hairstyle and mannerisms without getting busted of course. This movie had more action and humor in it for the time. Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans were a poor man's version of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover of the Lethal Weapon saga. And nothing could stop these guys to be the heroes of the moment! To me I found The Last Boy Scout an excellent Hilario's adventure from start to finish. In fact I loved it so much the first time I refused to take a bathroom break during the final 30 minutes of the film because I feared I would miss a great action scene or so. What's missing about The Last Boy Scout sadly to tell you is a sequel. I hoped and prayed that it would come to be in the future. But it never materialized or any news came through. A real bummer because the ending left the door wide open for a Last Boy Scout Part 2. But I definitely do not want a sequel with different actors playing Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans' roles should there be one. These guys kicked Major League Ass! You Can't Miss This One By Any Means Buddy!".

Damon Wayans is no Danny Glover or Sam Jackson but there is a definite chemistry with Bruce Willis and you can really tell on screen how much fun they're having during the shoot.The Last Boy Scout is everything a male action enthusiast can desire there's enough wit to last three movies and the action is generously displayed by Tony Scott on screen. The pacing is actually done well for a change which is more than can be said about most in the genre. The acting of the supporting cast may not be top notch but then again that wasn't the case for the Lethal Weapon films and they managed to entertain me for four editions.The villains are hilariously dorky but that's part of the fun of watching these 'old' action movies. You see bad eighties haircuts and the music playing in the background is as wrong as it gets usually 'Miami Vice'like. Take everything with a grain or a bag of salt and just lay back and enjoy. There isn't a man alive who can't enjoy TLBS on some level even if it's just as a guilty pleasure.Recommended!".

The movie shows the redemption of a downonhisluck detective. Many complain of it being antiwoman but I see a man still in love with his wife and forgives her at the end. Many don't understand what he says to her at the end of the movie but they weren't paying attention at the beginning to get the point. Great action lots of bullets lots of brutality and lots of comedy. I believe this to be one of Bruce Willis' best movies. They just don't make em like this anymore well maybe they try but can't get it right. Having Joe kill a man by punching his nose into his brain and then casually pick up a cigarette and sit down and smoke it has to be one of the best scenes i've ever seen.

Many critics complain about the sexism in the film the same critics say nothing of this fact in Gone With The Wind and countless other 'Classics'. And don't give me any nonsense about how things were different back then as long as there are men and womenthere will always be sexism and the treatment of women here is nowhere near as bad as they would have you believe. Halle Berry stars as a dancer her character is not the sharpest she falls for a simple trick and is killed. The men who treat women badly in the film are shown to be scumbags and each of these men gets what they deserve. In the case of Joe's wife she is strong but sidelined for most of the film she was screwing her husband's partner remember but his daughter played by the magnificent Danielle Harris who makes Dakota Fanning look like she has never acted in her life is witty intelligent and strong and saves the day on a couple of occasions. Yes it is a macho film but it is aware of that fact and that within this genre such a fact can be subverted. Admittedly this has been done much better in other films but The Last Boy Scout still tries to be 'one for the men' mainly.Now the plot Joe a washed up exbodyguard played by Willis is hired to protect a washed up NFL star's dancer girlfriend. Wayans The NFL star doesn't like it believing he can do the job himself. When she is killed the two form an unlikely partnership and investigate her death. The uncover a plot which involves senators and coaches and they race to save the life of the scumbag Senator Willis once worked for. Joe's daughter is kidnapped and he comes to remember that family is the most important thing he has and he will not let anything harm that. After many explosive fights the 3 square up against the bad guys in a final encounter.The stunts are worthy of mentioning in the same breath as those of Die Hard but as they are not in a confined space they have less of an impact. However the script is far superior than most action movies and it must surly rank in the top 10 quotable movies of all time. It seems that every line of dialogue is repeatable. Wayans is excellent almost equalling Eddie Murphy's BHCop performance Willis is perfect as Joe Harris proves she is easily one of the best actresses around but for some reason she never gets the big parts and the rest of the cast is strong. There are countless funny moments the action by Shane west of Predator and Die Hard fame is adrenaline charged and the direction is fast and controlled by Scott. This was widely overlooked for a variety of reasons but all selfrespecting action fans should definitely get this on DVD as you won't be disappointed. 9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "With Valentine's Day just past let me warn the three guys who haven't seen this film yet that it probably isn't the best one to sit back and watch with your wifegirlfriendincognito lover during a romantic night at home as the four dominating elements of the film are football crude and explicit buddy jokes testosterone fueled bloody violence and women either trashy strippers or cheating wives of course getting shot dead andor verbally abused at length. I've been watching this movie since it came out unfortunately I never did see it in the theaters but i rented the VHS back in probably 1992 and bought the DVD about 2 or 3 years ago and just most recently rewatched it on Valentine's eve all alone with my thoughts and my beer. Next to Die Hard this is hands down my favorite Bruce Willis film as the movie has a very subtle neonoir flavor mixed with a modern urban setting. Willis is a down and out detective and costar Wayans one of 'em is a disgraced exfootball player. Long story very short the two end up partnering up to solve a mildly complex murderextortionassassination plot centered around pro football and the 48 Hrstype mayhem ensues. The screenplay and story are written by none other than Shane pussy jokes in Predator Black of Lethal Weapon fame so you know the story will be of a higher grade of 'mindless action flick'. This film is produced by Joel Silver so it seals it's fate as that type of action film where the violence is over the top and the look is well polished and slick. But I like that and this film has great pacing relentless it is more or less impossible to be bored by this film and I enjoy the LA style cinematography what does that mean? i don't know but it just feels like LA the movies version anyway. The dialog is record breakingly explicit which is a bonus for me. The fights are bloody and the body count respectable. And for those that remember my Robocop 2 review a while ago see my comments there about my opinion on socalled 'irresponsible' movies with kids using guns and dropping fboms sic. Truth is i'm not even really a football fan but i'm enough of a guy to realize this movie would be on most football fans top movies lists no doubt so most highly recommend for them. Also recommended for Bruce Willis fans as he plays a John McClane meets Hudson Hawk crossbreed type here. Anybody who likes buddy Stakeout type movies would like this too. Also fans of the Wayans brothers would get a kick out of a young Damon kicking ass all over the screen and playing a more emotionaldramatic role than he usually does. Hell I even recommend this for kids young teens because that's when I discovered it and I turned out fine maybe.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shane Black really hit his stride with this mindless regurgitation of his own Lethal Weapon. Did he actually write this script with a word processor or wipe it out of his butt on a role of toilet paper? There are more unnecessary F bombs in this than there are flying bullets crashing cars and plot holes combined. Only unlike a film say like Get Shorty there is very little wit to go with the endless profanity. Sure teenage boys and IQchallenged redneck men  and of course Quentin Tarantino  will have found Willis and Wayans' profane quips and one liners hilarious but I just found it to be tiresome and stupidly unnecessary dialogue. Especially when the kid is spewing it. Nice touch there by all involved.But then again the whole movie was unnecessary spew. Stupid plot to do with corruption in pro football and politics familial dysfunction infidelity and a couple of gun packing losers caught in the middle of it all conspires to make one of the most implausible noisy badly filmed and edited action crapfests of all time. Tony Scott can bite me with his pumped up testosterone charged colored light filtered sloppy direction and camerawork. And Shane Black can bite me twice for the hackneyed piece of crap he called a script.Bruce Willis just bites in general. I normally miss most of the stuff he's in because he just doesn't give a damn about how bad a script is before he signs on but sometimes I need a movie fix and there's nothing on but swill like this.I've always thought Willis looks a lot in some pictures like Dick Powell when Powell starred in those classic hardboiled film noirs of the 40's and 50's such as Murder My Sweet and Cry Danger. And someone must have told Willis that on the set because he's pretty much doing a Powell imitation here though the dialogue often lets him down.The dialogue in those Powell noirs was consistently crisp tough and hip and spoken accordingly by actors who had talent. In The Last Boy Scout writer Black is so desperately wanting to emulate that kind of snazzy dialogue that he often paints himself into a corner ending up handing Willis or Wayans an adolescent howler to finish off a back and forth. But then amid the endless assault of profanity who really noticed?I won't even get into the disturbing misogyny littered throughout this waste of film. A most unenjoyable night at the movies. Why isn't there a 10 rating option?".

	schema:reviewBody "Kudos to Leonardo DiCaprio for putting his time and money into this outstanding documentary.Let's face it any informedintelligentobjective person already knows that we're on a greased path toward species extinction and that we must change course. The 11th Hour is an excellent vehicle for increasing the numbers of folks in that category ...and for reinforcing the knowledge basecommitment of those who think that that they already know this stuff.The 11th Hour goes way beyond simply pointing at problems. This wonderful documentary provides a fairly sharp focus on practicalviable solutions and serves up some inspiringmotivating ideasinsights.The use of captivating cinematography and stunning images make for a powerful impact. I hope that the production company releases a book that detailsdocuments the observationsassertionsconclusions of film's experts. Such a volume if done well would serve as an excellent part of any school curriculum.The 11th hour is a must see if you......care about whether or not there is a human race around in the next couple of hundred years....care about the quality of life for your children and their children over the next 50 years....are a young person who expects to be around for the next 60 to 80 years then this is all about your future.As one watches The 11th Hour it becomes painfully clear that it doesn't matter how rich or powerful one may be there can be no escaping the inexorable consequences of the indefensibly insaneunsustainable global industrialeconomic model a model clearly based on little more than short term greed.As effectivegood as The 11th Hour is at conveying factual data in a way that holds your attention....it could have gone in a totally different direction. A dramatic feature film needs to be made that more fully capturesdocuments the emotional and existential impact of the consequences of current environmental policies a kind of Erin Brockovitch of Global WarmingClimate Change. Clearly this isn't the last word in this genre. This is not a crisis that is out there in some vague future. Real people's lives are being destroyed now. There are many millions of canaries in the coal mine of our biosphere for whom climate change is life and death issue in the near term. Bottom lines The 11th Hour is a powerful documentary that manages to alarm without fear mongering and to paint a bleakly honest picture without engendering hopelessness.Go seesupport this movie.

	onyx:emotionText "Kudos to Leonardo DiCaprio for putting his time and money into this outstanding documentary.Let's face it any informedintelligentobjective person already knows that we're on a greased path toward species extinction and that we must change course. The 11th Hour is an excellent vehicle for increasing the numbers of folks in that category ...and for reinforcing the knowledge basecommitment of those who think that that they already know this stuff.The 11th Hour goes way beyond simply pointing at problems. This wonderful documentary provides a fairly sharp focus on practicalviable solutions and serves up some inspiringmotivating ideasinsights.The use of captivating cinematography and stunning images make for a powerful impact. I hope that the production company releases a book that detailsdocuments the observationsassertionsconclusions of film's experts. Such a volume if done well would serve as an excellent part of any school curriculum.The 11th hour is a must see if you......care about whether or not there is a human race around in the next couple of hundred years....care about the quality of life for your children and their children over the next 50 years....are a young person who expects to be around for the next 60 to 80 years then this is all about your future.As one watches The 11th Hour it becomes painfully clear that it doesn't matter how rich or powerful one may be there can be no escaping the inexorable consequences of the indefensibly insaneunsustainable global industrialeconomic model a model clearly based on little more than short term greed.As effectivegood as The 11th Hour is at conveying factual data in a way that holds your attention....it could have gone in a totally different direction. A dramatic feature film needs to be made that more fully capturesdocuments the emotional and existential impact of the consequences of current environmental policies a kind of Erin Brockovitch of Global WarmingClimate Change. Clearly this isn't the last word in this genre. This is not a crisis that is out there in some vague future. Real people's lives are being destroyed now. There are many millions of canaries in the coal mine of our biosphere for whom climate change is life and death issue in the near term. Bottom lines The 11th Hour is a powerful documentary that manages to alarm without fear mongering and to paint a bleakly honest picture without engendering hopelessness.Go seesupport this movie. The last half hour alone which deals very positively with aspects of the political dimension is worth the price of admission.";

	schema:reviewBody "Narrated produced and spearheaded by Leonardo DiCaprio this documentary about how humans have damaged the earth and what chance we still may have of reversing the destruction is hard to summarize since it's a breathless amalgam of fact and opinion from dozens of experts and pundits. But here's a try The planet is nearing meltdown. It's not just global warming. It began with the industrial revolution when we started mistakenly looking on nature as external to us and endlessly exploitable. Forests have undergone major destruction. The ocean is turning stagnant. The soil itself is largely damaged everywhere. Worst of all 50000 species a year are becoming extinct and no ecosystem can be identified as improving. Not to mention the fact that humans suffer from increasing numbers of diseases our pollution causes. At fault is the overproduction of nonsustainable manufactures the immense waste and destruction and the sustaining unsustainably of vastly more people than the planet can support. Behind all this the primary cause is the fuels we use petroleum being the primary one.So far the process can still be slowed perhaps reversedbut not for long. We have the technology though nature itself rather than any manmade thing is the greatest resource and the solution is in harmonizing ourselves with it not further dominating it. In a few years we will have reached the point of no return. This is not just the 11th hour but the last few seconds of the sixtieth minute of that hour. Within this new century if nothing effective is achieved planetary damage will be dramatic and total in every area. It's impossible to predict but extreme disaster could come very rapidly once the balance is decisively tipped in the wrong direction and it will happen everywhere. Nowhere is safe from it.As one reviewer has said if we don't slit our throats after hearing the first half of this story some intriguing options are suggested in the last third Various speakers believe that while humanity may not survive without a reversal of the trend life on earth probably will. Welcome to Insectopia. But surprisingly enough though everything we do has to be changed radically and totally things won't necessarily look wholly different. The difference will be inside. An 85 efficient train car looks just like a little old train car only its interior works will have changed. A wholly selfsustainable skyscraper still looks on the outside just like a skyscraper the new Bank America building in New York resembles the Transamerica Pyramid in San Francisco only with more glass.Not only are the technologies all available but there are many plans about how to use them and doing so can be immensely profitable even for existing businesses if they alter their products and raw materials. The obstacle is resistant mindsets and above all a lack of leadership. There's another obstaclewell many and they're mostly in the United States. The large corporations in whose interest it is to go on gobbling fossil fuel or as writer Thom Hartman calls it ancient sunlight rule our world and our American leaders are their marionettes. The average working guy doesn't think beyond the morning traffic report. We all need to learn to care. Dippy as it sounds all we need is love. And we can act fast when we want tolook at the American performance in WWII.Al Gore has greeted The 11th Hour as a sequel to An Inconvenient Truth. In a sense it is that. In David Guggenheim's Oscarwinning film Gore demonstrates why and how global warming is a reality and a cause of grave concern. The 11th Hour sets this event in a larger context warns further of the urgency of acting now and unlike Inconvenient Truth goes into detail about practical solutions. The 11th Hour unfortunately isn't as polished and effective as An Inconvenient Truth. The latter is unified by Gore's personality. DiCaprio provides an appealing sort of youthful everyman voice even a Hollywood superstar becomes an everyman in this context but he doesn't hold The 11th Hour together. Though the range of expertise is impressive and valuable structurally there is a dauntingly rapid succession of different faces. Even during the 11th hour of 11th Hour new speakers keep appearing and it's difficult to take in all the names and credentials first time through. Luckily there are a few strong and unmistakable voices like the broadcaster David Suzuki Stephen Hawking Mikhail Gorbachov. The soft southern accent of Interface founder Ray Anderson a good corporate CEO is familiar from the Gore film.Sometimes information and animated diagrams go by with ridiculous speed. It's as if the filmmakers were a little terrified of omitting something. This will work fine on a DVD where you can freezeframe to check things out it doesn't work so well in a theater. Speededup urban sequences look like some sloppy version of Koyaanisqatsi. These flaws make one nostalgic for Gore's measured tones. His detractors called Inconvenient Truth a glorified Power Point lecture. But that's much better than sounding as DiCaprio occasionally does like the narrator of some high school educational flick.Consequently it's not too surprising that 11th Hour has fared less well critically than Truth despite some significant championsthe critics of some of the major US papers and smart writers like Andres O'Hehir of Salon.com David Edelstein of New York Magazine Jonathan Rosenbaum of The Chicago Readerand one could go on. Ultimately the film's weaknesses don't matter because its content is too important and smart to dismiss.Attacking The 11th Hour feels unwiselike killing the messenger. Conners and Peterson and DiCaprio and all those bright people are saying things we need to hear. Is the quality of this movie really such an issue? The far more significant issue raised is this sure we can vote by buying lowwatt bulbs and recycling and reducing our individual carbon footprints. But to act collectively we'll need that sofarmissing leadership. Where is it going to come from?".

If not for a momentary interest on the subject I would have probably passed it up altogether. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was extremely nuanced being an insightful and scientific investigation on mankind's role in global warming.Rather than spurting out random facts and events like most documentaries The 11th Hour uses a wide range of viewpoints to build a conceptual foundation that explains the general scientific impression of global warming. Some of the ideas may end up being wrong but all of them are at least plausible. The different speakers include Paul Hawken Wangari Maathai Mikhail Gorbachev and my favorite Stephen Hawking. There are many different ideas communicated but they are all based on the same underlying principle. The structure of the documentary is very dialog heavy which can feel overwhelming at times but is guaranteed to bring forth new knowledge to viewers.The main ideas are nothing new for most people educated on environmental news but the speakers submit some profound new ways of looking at them. A common theme was relating Earth's existence to the human civilization's existence. If we continue to progress global warming the planet might be able to heal itself eventually but only once humans are gone. One thing I found especially interesting was the consideration of the economic value of nature which ended up being roughly two times greater than the world's industrial wealth.My only significant complaint is that the film is often rough in style organization and editing. The images sometimes feel out of place or even distracting from the message. Occasionally the images rapidly jump between completely different environments which can be hard to process. To be sure most of the cinematography was excellent but it just wasn't put together in the best way. Overall it could have been more focused.The 11th Hour is an insightful and inspiring documentary on one of the most important topics to date. It provides a balanced and comprehensive conceptual overview on the human role in global warming but also expects viewers to take this knowledge out of the theater and implement it into their own lives.

Gore also interjects humor and his own personality into a documentary about his own crusade while DiCaprio's is more straightforward inundating the audience with mindnumbing facts and portents of doom. He also doesn't focus attention to his own personality but stays merely a narrator. The 11th Hour is more comprehensive drawing from various sources but lacks breathing room to digest each infoload periodically dumped on screen. It decides to interject these pockets of space for reflection far too late already in the middle of the reel. DiCaprio's narration is also a disappointment. He is great eye candy that serves to pull the crowd to the theater a terrific actor and is capable of memorizing tomes of text in his movies but in his own documentary his eyes too obviously dart left to right at a teleprompter which loses the impact and earnestness he needs to communicate and connect to the audience. Meanwhile the lessphysically appealing Gore successfully portrays himself in Rockylike fashion valiantly trudging on in his uphill battle which makes the audience identify with and root for him. To The 11th Hour's credit it offers more solutions on an individual level than Gore's. Despite the fragmented expositions of its wellmeaning interview subjects it offers hope and a heroic sense of optimism that we can still do something about the issue.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although I'm far from backing up my ideals with all my actions I am pretty much in the choir when it comes to this ecomessagedocumentary fronted by filmstar Leonardo DiCaprio because I am liberal make an effort to recycle and have the good taste to worry about my resource use I know how that sounds but at least I'm honest. So for me it is not an issue to review the film without it turning into me taking issue with the overall message of the film. If anything I risk the other trap that many have fallen into  which is to review the message and not the film. So let me just get that trap out the way by saying that the message in my opinion is worthy and important and I have no doubt that all those involved in this film felt this and were keen to get it made and out to as big an audience as possible.Reviewing the film is a different thing altogether though because while the aim may have been to get the message out there and push this agenda the actual film itself does the opposite due to the way it is delivered. The structure content and style of the film is flawed across the board and it did put me off  leading me to wonder how someone who was sceptical to begin with would cope with the flaws in it as a film. Where The Inconvenient Truth builds its case and took the viewer along with it 11th Hour just jumps right in and never stops hitting the viewer with information. Nothing wrong with that in concept but when it is done in a poorly structured and fastpaced way it does rather feel like you are being preached at by a hellfire reverend rather than talked to or even lectured in the academic sense of the word. The visuals don't help partly because they are just frantic and unnecessary at times but also because they clash with the much more sedentary talking heads that fill the vast majority of the running time. The end result is the feeling that the film is just trying to bully you into submission rather than carefully taking you down a path where even some sceptics will be conceding points.There is plenty of good stuff in here and those that are already won over may not even feel the flaws in delivery as they nod their heads in agreement. However while I can agree on the importance of the message and the aims of the makers good intentions alone do not make for a good film and here the delivery is consistently weak in a couple of key areas to the detriment of the film. A shame but this is one for the choir and even then it needs a chunk of good will to ignore the film and concentrate solely on the message.".

So let me just get that trap out the way by saying that the message in my opinion is worthy and important and I have no doubt that all those involved in this film felt this and were keen to get it made and out to as big an audience as possible.Reviewing the film is a different thing altogether though because while the aim may have been to get the message out there and push this agenda the actual film itself does the opposite due to the way it is delivered. The structure content and style of the film is flawed across the board and it did put me off  leading me to wonder how someone who was sceptical to begin with would cope with the flaws in it as a film. Where The Inconvenient Truth builds its case and took the viewer along with it 11th Hour just jumps right in and never stops hitting the viewer with information. Nothing wrong with that in concept but when it is done in a poorly structured and fastpaced way it does rather feel like you are being preached at by a hellfire reverend rather than talked to or even lectured in the academic sense of the word. The visuals don't help partly because they are just frantic and unnecessary at times but also because they clash with the much more sedentary talking heads that fill the vast majority of the running time. The end result is the feeling that the film is just trying to bully you into submission rather than carefully taking you down a path where even some sceptics will be conceding points.There is plenty of good stuff in here and those that are already won over may not even feel the flaws in delivery as they nod their heads in agreement. However while I can agree on the importance of the message and the aims of the makers good intentions alone do not make for a good film and here the delivery is consistently weak in a couple of key areas to the detriment of the film. A shame but this is one for the choir and even then it needs a chunk of good will to ignore the film and concentrate solely on the message.";

	schema:reviewBody "I guess we can attest that the local weather of late has gone bonkers. More often than note we have incredibly hot and humid weather with bright sunshine one half of the day before the skies turn grey and pours heavily on us. We've seen even more occurrences of water spouts emerging just off our shore and we've done the boogie when neighbouring countries suffer jolts in the earth from which we will feel tremors enough for us to abandon our high rise buildings. While we're relatively buffered from direct adverse weather effects not a day goes by without reading or knowing about strange weather phenomenon from around the world.The Earth is dying and nature is taking its revenge on us for plundering her lands and exploiting her resources in a wasteful manner. The signs are out there but we'd rather be oblivious to them. And Al Gore after his attempt to ascend the White House has gone back to his pet subject and evangelized about saving the earth through his very slick package which was given a cinematic life by Davis Guggenheim with An Inconvenient Truth. A call to action I don't deny that I've started to pay a little more attention to it and though my effort can be considered minuscule I suppose it's but a start.Leonardo DiCaprio lends his star power to The 11th Hour which he produced and narrates but unlike Al Gore who can be considered a subject matter expert in his own right given his years of devotion to this topic DiCaprio realizes his deficiency in this area and smartly takes a backseat by just narrating a very small portion of the movie leaving most of the talk to true experts who can properly articulate and appeal to our common senses. In that respect The 11th Hour provided a much more diverse perspective of the entire situation from the micro to the much bigger picture of the entire ecosystem and the various views philosophies and schools of thought.Arguments come fast and furious with content ranging from discussions of fossil fuels global warming an interesting articulation of present and ancient power sources and the astonishing rate of our population boom visavis the ability of the planet to sustain life not just ours but every other species on the planet which will depend on our mismanagement of common resource. The 11th hour contains a very compelling look not just at the environment as a standalone but turns the spotlight on us as its inhabitants as well. We get bombarded from all directions with opinions and statements of an impending apocalypse of our own doing and I assure you if you're not frightened by the Revelation I don't know what will.It's not just slick Keynote presentation which Gore's material is utilizing to bring the message across and a very effective one I might add and we also get the usual stock videos of hurricanes and well referenced clips of the melting polar caps. It's unfair to compare Inconvenient Truth to 11th Hour as both have used different styles to bring across the same message  that the fate of the world and of course our survival as a species is very much dependent on what we do now to effect a change. The Earth is renewable and can selfheal given an immense amount of time but we have but one chance to make things right for ourselves.But before you think of this documentary as just being another harbinger of doom and gloom The 11th Hour does end off on a very hopeful note just like how An Inconvenient Truth did. Here it focused on renewable and recyclabl e methodologies which we might have already come across albeit in a small niche way yet to convince mega corporations to adopt. Perhaps with time when feasibility is demonstrated they would and that's when we need to wean ourselves off the reliance of oil which are hitting record prices per barrel and arguably the cause of unnecessary war. The new building designs look awesome especially with the incorporation of green technologies adopted no less from the learning of how organisms operate. Think of it as adopting the best practices from species and the natural environment and fusing it with our modern day technology and designs.The 11th Hour is a must watch not only for enlightenment purposes but rather for a call to action once the lights come on. Again we need to be reminded on how much we can do and to actually do it. Last year we listened to An Inconvenient Truth and now The 11th Hour brings forth that sense of urgency to do much more.".

This is absolutely NOT how to reach an audience if that audience is nonexperts.My college work is in political science sociology and technical writing and editing. If you want to make an impact on an audience you must target the message to the audience like Al Gore did. You cannot bludgeon a nontech savvy audience with techno babble. Talking about the abstract concept we call the environment won't work. You have to tell people both how these separate facets are affecting them now sometimes in ways they don't realize and how they will likely affect them in five years ten years twenty years etc.The good news is this was attempted several times in the film. When it was it reached me. One example was when an interviewee spoke about the growth of asthma among school children. That was good. Because I am the uncle of three children under 11 years of age that had a direct connection to my life. If the film had been at least half of this it would be much more successful in delivering the message. Instead the noise killed the message.Leo I really appreciate what you tried to do. But you lost me. May I suggest you pick up a classic book on environmental rhetoric. It is Green Culture by Herndl and Brown. Pay attention to the essay Saving the Great Lakes. It will show you how to reach both your audience and the powers that be by recounting the reallife impact this environmental devastation is having on our lives.The next thing I'd like to see is a weekly television series on Sundance Channel or perhaps in syndication that shows the daily impact of catastrophic climate change on the average person. It would be an environmental version of Morgan Spurlock's 30 Days series. I believe it's impact would be profound.".

	schema:reviewBody "Make no bones about it we live in weird times. We're now feed to believe that scientific understanding is synonymous to a system of belief. At this moment no one has caused any convictions to contradict their theories but the main topics in the air in the scientific community right now are evolution and the fears of our failing ecosystem caused by the effect of global warming. I never thought that the laws of physics even cared about our environmental concerns that could effect our ecosystem forever. And as we speak we are still debating if the melting of our icebergs is a sign that our ecosystem is in declining health or if it's a sign the Jesus is coming back with a vengeance. It comes to no surprise that that this movie had to include some antiscience religious fanatic to appease some appraisal to the Republican party's agenda. Thanks to this individual the Republicans are obligated to believe that in spite of all the toxins polluting the air the debris in our rivers the massive oil spills and the deforestation of our Earth is just fine for our environment if you have the power to believe.Of course the perpetual liberal agenda that is Hollywood will gladly milk in the celebrity endorsements to challenge this global concern. And who's better to conduct this with open heart mixed with narrowminded integrity is non other than Hollywood's Golden Boy Leonardo DiCaprio. Like a sequel to Al Gore's The Inconvenient Truth DiCaprio continues where Gore left us and also serves as a producer as well. The 11th Hour tells an intelligent and insightful alarming state of the ecological mismanagement our planet has suffered from over the years. And it doesn't look like its going to get better any time soon.A cornucopia of professors journalists authors scientists and politicians to discuss this matter of how it has an affect on us and what we should be concerned about. And the big names are quite impressive. Among the heavythinkers is the king of thinkers Dr. Stephen Hawking and among the bigname politicians is former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. But among the impressive speakers that caught my attention was the very knowledgeable and wellspoken former CIA director James Woolsey. These mainstream of experts tell us we don't have the strength to completely destroy the land that gave us life but rather the ability to make life more complicated towards ourselves and our legacy to follow us when were dead. The Earth will continue to move forward whether its inhabited by humans or fleas.For that muchneeded celebrity starpower DiCaprio narrates this documentary. Though that's not a bad thing because he has a great voice for narrating his gravitas lacks in maturity compared to Morgan Freeman or George Clooney. His delivery of words seems way too giddy in all his earnest intentions his youthful appearance makes him look like he's posing for a teen magazine. And that novice director Leila ConnorsPetersen and Nadia Connors presented this film way too conventionally. There's just way too many talking heads with only brief fragments of ecological concerning footage. Sure it's giving us a fair warning which may make you reevaluate your thinking but fails to show you the bigger picture.The main question I have for this documentary is who is their target audience? Granted it gives the general population as a whole a little something to think about. But in the end it all comes down to the people already in that train of thought. This movie could have the potential to covert Bill O'Reilly to volunteer for Greenpeace. Instead he'll just find a way to conflict himself against the liberal biased Hollywood.The only people who might watch this film are those who may watched Al Gore's The Inconvenient Truth. Which is quite sad because in that documentary the lecture is gritty with impressive visuals and a flow that's easy to grasp at. The 11th Hour suffers from the fact that its executed to a more deeperrooted philosophical vibe which makes it more encapsulating than it is obtainable. Which is sad because there's a lot to talk about in The 11th Hour.After all the doom gloom that's killing our planet it does shed a light of optimism and the solutions they have for us are both simple and practical. And it's nice that were not getting lectured by radical hippies telling us we all need to live in huts and grow more trees and eat the foods we grow. Instead the more intellectuals are just telling us we don't need to change our lifestyles but rather depend on our modern technology to generate more fueleconomy cars and recyclable clothing frugal windpower and ecological friendly households.Even though The 11th Hour is very strong in subject matter and good on intention the presentation could've been more better. And though I commend Leo for a job well done in narration we really didn't need a Hollywood star tells us our wrongdoings. We're capable of figuring it our ourselves without the star power.".

Thanks to this individual the Republicans are obligated to believe that in spite of all the toxins polluting the air the debris in our rivers the massive oil spills and the deforestation of our Earth is just fine for our environment if you have the power to believe.Of course the perpetual liberal agenda that is Hollywood will gladly milk in the celebrity endorsements to challenge this global concern. And who's better to conduct this with open heart mixed with narrowminded integrity is non other than Hollywood's Golden Boy Leonardo DiCaprio. Like a sequel to Al Gore's The Inconvenient Truth DiCaprio continues where Gore left us and also serves as a producer as well. The 11th Hour tells an intelligent and insightful alarming state of the ecological mismanagement our planet has suffered from over the years. And it doesn't look like its going to get better any time soon.A cornucopia of professors journalists authors scientists and politicians to discuss this matter of how it has an affect on us and what we should be concerned about. And the big names are quite impressive. Among the heavythinkers is the king of thinkers Dr. Stephen Hawking and among the bigname politicians is former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. But among the impressive speakers that caught my attention was the very knowledgeable and wellspoken former CIA director James Woolsey. These mainstream of experts tell us we don't have the strength to completely destroy the land that gave us life but rather the ability to make life more complicated towards ourselves and our legacy to follow us when were dead. The Earth will continue to move forward whether its inhabited by humans or fleas.For that muchneeded celebrity starpower DiCaprio narrates this documentary. Though that's not a bad thing because he has a great voice for narrating his gravitas lacks in maturity compared to Morgan Freeman or George Clooney. His delivery of words seems way too giddy in all his earnest intentions his youthful appearance makes him look like he's posing for a teen magazine. And that novice director Leila ConnorsPetersen and Nadia Connors presented this film way too conventionally. There's just way too many talking heads with only brief fragments of ecological concerning footage. Sure it's giving us a fair warning which may make you reevaluate your thinking but fails to show you the bigger picture.The main question I have for this documentary is who is their target audience? Granted it gives the general population as a whole a little something to think about. But in the end it all comes down to the people already in that train of thought. This movie could have the potential to covert Bill O'Reilly to volunteer for Greenpeace. Instead he'll just find a way to conflict himself against the liberal biased Hollywood.The only people who might watch this film are those who may watched Al Gore's The Inconvenient Truth. Which is quite sad because in that documentary the lecture is gritty with impressive visuals and a flow that's easy to grasp at. The 11th Hour suffers from the fact that its executed to a more deeperrooted philosophical vibe which makes it more encapsulating than it is obtainable. Which is sad because there's a lot to talk about in The 11th Hour.After all the doom gloom that's killing our planet it does shed a light of optimism and the solutions they have for us are both simple and practical. And it's nice that were not getting lectured by radical hippies telling us we all need to live in huts and grow more trees and eat the foods we grow. Instead the more intellectuals are just telling us we don't need to change our lifestyles but rather depend on our modern technology to generate more fueleconomy cars and recyclable clothing frugal windpower and ecological friendly households.Even though The 11th Hour is very strong in subject matter and good on intention the presentation could've been more better. And though I commend Leo for a job well done in narration we really didn't need a Hollywood star tells us our wrongdoings. We're capable of figuring it our ourselves without the star power.";

With captivating visuals that appeal not only to the aesthetic senses but emotional ones as well this movie's ultimate message is both frightening and beautiful. This movie's only true flaw lies in its unintentional demonization of technology.

The juxtaposition of the industrial process for making Kevlar to the natural chemistry of a spiderweb is damning to an industry that has saved thousands of lives.

He took time off to compose theBatman soundtrack and in late '89 he began filming GraffitiBridge. Many that got first dibs on the film forewarned a lot ofpeople about it. Graffiti Bridge was released in the fall of 1990with horrible reviews. It also bombed at the box office. People thatdidn't even see the film gave it negative reviews. What people failto understand is that Graffiti Bridge is a musical. It is almost likea homage to the old 50's musicals that were filmed on studio lots.This was film on Prince's Paisley Park compound giving it acheap look. Perhaps Prince took himself a little bit too seriouslywhen advertising it and threw people off making them think it is aregular movie. Graffiti Bridge is like one long music video. Andhonestly the acting is horrible. The highlight of the film has to bethe music. That is the whole point. It is a musical and nothing else.So don't watch Graffiti Bridge expecting a real movie with dramaand great acting. It's a good film but it has it's flaws.Graffiti Bridge rated R 12 out of ".

Good news is the sound track was a 'seller' from what I understood. I don't know if I'll ever figure what he was attempting to convey other than to bring about the glory days of a sequel to 'Rain'.

	schema:reviewBody "Maybe I'm not the best person to judge a Prince film as I am partial to his music. And while he's no De Niro with his expressive face I don't think he's that terrible an actor either. I wouldn't particularly want to see him taking on straight roles but he gives a performance that can carry a wellmeaning musical as indeed this is.Yet despite all this Graffiti Bridge is a movie I had low expectations of after poor reviews and a straighttovideo release in the UK. Not only that but the soundtrack album an eclectic collection of songs at best was perhaps Prince's only faux pas in his strong 19801991 period. While Controversy may have been indulgent and BatmanDiamonds and Pearls more progressively mainstream none of the albums contained anything as truly terrible as this film's title song arguably the worst Prince song of all time.Yet the film  an unofficial sequel to Purple Rain  is surprisingly entertaining. The direction by Prince himself is remarkably assured and while the performances by fellow musicians aren't quite so polished they are fun Morris Day particularly. Only Ingrid Chavez really disappoints with a slightly wooden diction. The script isn't all that hot though Prince shows noted selfeffacement in the dialogue on occasion. He's alternately described as a little cricket and a little prick at various stages. As he himself said around the time he wasn't trying to be Francis Ford Coppola.The deliberately cartoonish pseudonoir sets evoke memories of the Tim Burton Batman movies while the variable song material works far better within the film's framework than as a standalone CD spinoff. All are present and correct from said album except the opener Can't Stop This Feeling I Got. The movie also contains four songs not on the soundtrack  Seven Corners Blondie Jerk Out and Number 1. In the case of the latter a trite ditty performed by Robin Power this is perhaps fortunate. The tracks are arguably more derivative than usual  the funky Shake! has a chord line more than a little similar to 96 Tears. Though that said while not firstrate Prince songs like New Power Generation Thieves in the Temple and Still Would Stand All Time are above standard. Even weaker efforts like The Question of U and Elephants  Flowers seem improved within this context even if the miming doesn't always convince.Some of the dance sequences  The Time performing Release It and in particular prodigiously talented Tevin Campbell with Round and Round  are excellent. Some of the dialogue passages Abandoned on the street at the tender age of seven how could I ever learn the real meaning of Heaven? indicate the artist's increasing pretension and loss of irony however. While the repetitious drama inherent  Prince as noble romantic underdog hero Day as allpowerful lecherous villain  doesn't really go anywhere but this is by no means the turkey it's trumped up to be. Admittedly more of a film for aficionados of Prince and his music as a lighthearted showcase of said subject it succeeds admirably. Postscript August 2016 When I reviewed this 15 years ago I said Maybe I'm not the best person to judge a Prince film... how right I was. Somehow managing to give it 610 I watched what is a subpar movie through Purple tinted glasses. Prince fans might enjoy this film... but only once.".

Even worse is that all of the scenes appear to just be Prince showing off his wild costumes. The lack of any real story means you really don't care about the characters their situations or anything that happens to them. It's easy to see why Prince stayed away from movies after this one.".

Oh it's a bad movie all right but I don't quite get that it's one of the worst movies ever or even that it's significantly worse than Purple Rain. Honestly I think I prefer it just a bit to the 1984 film. It's far shorter and it's way goofier  doesn't take itself as seriously. Sure Purple Rain  the album  is Prince's masterpiece but the soundtrack to Graffiti Bridge while more stuck in the late 80searly 90s and less timeless is pretty great too. Plotwise the two films are pretty similar. Prince is the good guy Morris Day is the bad guy. They both fight over a girl here it's Ingrid Chavez who is beautiful but lacks the charisma of Apollonia she's most famous for cowriting the Madonna song Justify My Love. There are a lot of songs. The set design here is pretty fantastic and gives the film a surreal feel. I'm surprised the film isn't more beloved by cult audiences. It's very weird. And laughable but in a fun way. Morris Day threatened to be more interesting in Purple Rain and he succeeds in being so here. Prince has far less presence.".

	schema:reviewBody "First off I will say that I am not a prince fan. I have nothing bad to say about him or his music or his movies I am just not into it. However I love this movie. I've read a lot of horrible reviews about it and all I can say to them is that most of them are due to the fact that you are trying to compare movies. On its own this movie is beautiful the schematics of it the scenery and set design and the use of music to tell the story. To watch this movie on its own without a mind bias of assuming that because you liked and understood the previous movies you will like and understand this one...you find many elements of it that do appeal. The fact that there was very little speaking and more body language is beautiful The total distinction between all of the characters is beautiful. The total distinction in each and every song being unique is beautiful. When I first saw this movie the one thing that outright attracted me was Aura. Ingrid Chavez's use of body language in particular her facial expressions throughout this film are amazing. Each character had a very clear role and very clearly expressed what that role is. The set designs are both nostalgic and creative without being too overly artistic there is no exact time and place for this film sometimes you think you're in the 1920's in a back alley of a speakeasy sometimes you think you're in the 1980's dreaming about the 1990's. I believe the main thing that causes people to dislike this movie so much is a misunderstanding of the roles and the purposes in it. yes it is a battle between good and evil in a sense but goodthe kid and evilmorris day are NOT the focus points of it. The focus is Aura. In a chess game it is necessary to protect the king however the queen is the most powerful player on the board and it is very difficult to win a game if she is lost unless her sacrifice is so that the king or the other players are in position to check mate. she can move in any direct and any amount of spaces. Ingrid Chavez did that very well. Aura was quiet yet not silenced she only spoke when necessary and all the rest was expressed in her face. she did just what anyone else would do in her situation knowing what the outcome would be she still attempted to get there in other ways. Along side of the character of Aura is the music. People are forgetting that this is NOT just a movie but a musical. Musicals are meant to be expressive and theatrical they are not meant to WOW you like other films by visuals and plots. They are meant to open your mind and make you think and possibly find answers to things you don't know. Does anyone know if angels exist? Would you know an angel if you saw one? Could someones heart really truly be bad? Can people change? Is all music good or just the kind that makes us dance? Do actions speak louder than words? Do sinners have souls? All these questions can be pondered by watching this movie. But most people don't see that all they see is that this movie isn't like Purple Rain or Under the Cherry Moon all they can see is that they have to think a little bit in order to enjoy it and since it isn't spelled out for them or so overly artistic that it must have reason then it must be the worst prince movie ever. For Prince fans they don't see that all they see is that Prince is not the main point he is not as involved in it as he was in the other films there are even less scenes with him even in it and to them the music doesn't compare to the outright served up on a silver platter music of the others. it must be the worst prince movie ever. Loose all of your biases and this movie becomes one of the classic good movies. The main bias to loose is that this is not a Prince Movie...It's a MovieMusical from the mind of Prince.".

Purple Rain's had the normal thin classic I'm gonna make it in showbiz plot seen in countless films before it so it wasn't exactly a cerebral treat either. But it looked realistic the editing was tighter thereby covering up a few of the plot holes and you could believe it.Graffiti Bridge fails on all counts above. It was shot completely in Prince's private studio and it shows. Everything looks like a soundstage.  I realize of course that this was supposed to be an elaborate fantasy but the best abstract fantasies should at least be somewhat believable.Are there good parts?  Yes there are a few shining moments.  Morris Day and Jerome rekindle a bit of the chemistry they had in Purple Rain and younger Tevin Campbell's performance is remarkable.

Anyway Lingyu Ruan's acting was once again really outstanding and I thought that this was overall a better film than The Goddess. It tells the story of Wei Ming a feminist intellectual trying to make an independent living in a nearly completely male chauvinistic society. She has one enlightened male friend who is trying to help her get her book published but she is surrounded by misogynistic men who only want to use and degrade her. Once her daughter falls ill with leukemia things go from bad to worse and though I don't want to completely spoil the ending it is not a happy one at all. The relevance of that this film had at the time is reflected in how grimly foreboding it was of the lead actress' own fate.

Well subtlety where are you now!!??  My fears have manifested...a promising movie has gone wrong. Yes Eugenio Zannetti's production design is jawdropping the movie is wonderfully photographed and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never EVER do wrong. But the script puts it's fine actors to the test..asking them to deliver the kind of stilted dialogue that is only spoken in movies.  In the end the always wonderful Lili Taylor is the only performer to escape with some dignity...and that's just barely. But the crime of all crimes is that the horror is shown to us.  We can no longer use our imaginations feel that horrible dread of fear of the unknown.  No we get some visual effects to SHOW US what we're supposed to be afraid of...and you know what?  As wonderfully realized as they are...the visual effects come off as sort of silly.  And the climax is a phantasmogoric mess...but things had gone terribly wrong long before that. Everything in The Haunting is overdone and overblown.  I'm afraid there are no real thrills or creaks in this old haunted house monstrosity...only groans.   Check out the original instead.".

It's a haunting tale of 4 people who go into a haunted house and with the simple trick of sound and movements it terrified people. It still remains effective to this day if you appreciate film. So when The Haunting was remade in 1999 a lot of people pretty much had the same reaction WHAT? WHY? WHAT THE But in my opinion if a remake is respectful enough and just wants to reinvent the story for the newer generation I'm pretty cool with it. This is definitely not the case this is just a disrespectful boring shame that will waste your time and I guarantee will deliver no scares pfft! PG13 what where they thinking? Not much apparently.When her mother dies and her sister evicts her Nell receives a phone call telling her about an ad for an insomnia study run by Doctor David Marrow at Hill House a secluded manor. Upon arrival Nell meets Mr. and Mrs. Dudley a strange pair of caretakers who do not stay on the property after dark. Shortly thereafter two other participants in the study arrive wild Theo and bad sleeper Luke Sanderson along with Doctor Marrow. Unknown to the participants Doctor Marrow's true purpose is to study the psychological response to fear. Each night the caretakers chain the gate outside Hill House preventing anyone from getting in or out until morning when the caretakers open the lock. There are no working telephones inside Hill House and the nearest town is several miles away. Doctor Marrow revels the story of Hill House. The house was built by Hugh Crain Crain built the house for his wife hoping to fill it with a large family full of children however all of Crain's children died during birth. Crain's wife killed herself before the house was finished and Crain became a recluse. The first night Theo and Nell begin to experience strange phenomenon within the house including odd noises and inexplicable temperature changes. Nell is confronted after the main hallway is vandalized with the words Welcome Home Eleanor and becomes extremely distraught setting out to prove that the house is haunted by the souls of those victimized by Crain's cruelty. She learns that Crain built his fortune by exploiting kidnapped children for slave labor and murdering them when they were of no more use to him. He then burned the bodies in the house's fireplace to hide any evidence. She also learns that Crain had a second wife named Carolyn of whom Nell is descended. Everyone thinks she's crazy while Nell is convinced this is where she belongs.Seriously I suggest you stay away from this film it's really stupid and pointless. Not to mention the actress the played Nell Lili Taylor completely annoyed me her performance her look just everything about her don't get me started on things I would do just to not see her in film again. Catherine Zeta Jones just didn't fit in her role as well and Liam Neeson a wonderful actor wasted talent once again. The effects are way over the top and too computerized I just can't believe that they would trash a wonderful classic with this crud. Believe me if you are going to be afraid of something be afraid of seeing how you can turn a great ghost story into an annoying piece of overblown stupid. Oh this film is already hurting me just don't see it it's bad.110".

The setup is promising the production design of the mansion is a sight to behold and the cast seems to be enjoying themselves.  It's unfortunate however because after that the film begins to fall apart leading all the way to the ridiculously bad finale.Dr. David Marrow Liam Neeson is conducting a test on fear using the baitandswitch method.  By doing so he's pretending to do a study on insomnia at the Crain estate a manor 9 miles from the closest town.  The test subjects that arrive include Eleanor Lili Taylor a hardworking woman who has had little success in life Theo Catherine ZetaJones an adventuress  and proclaimed bisexual and Luke Owen Wilson an allaround jokester.On the first night in the mansion Eleanor and Theo hear thundering sounds in the walls but pass it off as a problem in the plumbing.  But events get even more bizarre as Eleanor sees some sort of a figure inside the fireplace that just as soon disappears.  Slowly Eleanor begins to believe that there are ghosts in the house ghosts of dead children and the owner of the mansion himself the evil Hugh Crain.  She also makes a discover about her connection with the mansion that could help free the children's spirits.The Haunting never features one scary moment.  Rather than going for subtle chills or allout shocks like in House on Haunted Hill Jan De Bont prefers to rely everything on the special effects which really are rather unconvincing particularly the statues that come to life and the CGI ghosts.It even manages to get worse.  Now to be fair the film was getting dull by the 90minute mark so I was initially entertained by the effectsfilled finale.  But everything gets positively ridiculous in the last ten minutes as we find out evil ghosts like to play hideandseek and smash things up real good.The blame should fall on director Jan De Bont and writer David Self.  De Bont seems to care more about what special effect to use next to wow the audience rather than actually trying anything innovative.  Self really can't seem to write a good story or truly interesting characters.  The dialogue is perhaps the worse of his writing skills.The only thing that keeps this film from a lower rating is the cast and they do their best to keep the film respectable.  Liam Neeson probably delivers the best performance being neither as dull or unemotional as critics thought.  Catherine ZetaJones shows a lot of life as Theo as does Owen Wilson.  It's a pity that Lili Taylor's performance which was decent at first turned to borderline camp by the finale.With nary a true scare in sight The Haunting should best be seen by those who are scared easily or special effects fans.  For everybody else this is probably a house not to spend the night at.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a remake to long deemed one of the masterly crafted stories of horror ever brought to the screen Haunting1963 by Robert Wise  a gripping film which still packs a punch . Hill House is a hundredyearold haunted mansion  it is the setting for chosen group . The haunted house has an evil history with tragic accidents suicide and human misjudgement. It seems which the scary mansion has been the place of several killing deaths . A psychologist scientist Liam Neeson is a Pyschic researcher who assembles a group with histories linked to the paranormal. As three people are lured to an eerie mansion deceived for fake pretenses realized by a psychological researcher . Nell Lili Taylor was the subject of unexplained poltergeist activities as a child. She also is riddled with pain over her mother's death. Theo Catherine Zeta Jones is a clairvoyant who befriends Nell at Hill House. Owen Wilson plays a cynical and Bon Vivant sent to make sure that the property is not affected by the researchers. Together the group explore Hill House and their own insecurities and finally face off the evil that inhabits with hairraising results .Mindless and average film is packed with thrills intrigue suspense horror and lots of interminable screams with no sense. However  this is an inferior version that relies heavily on the impressive special effects courtesy of ILM  Industrial Light Magic  George Lucas owner . High budget makes for big scary screamfeast and frights . Splendid Lili Taylor as a fragile  lovely youth who results to have unexpected ties to the creepy ghost  she's the only redeeming feature of this uneven movie. Supposedly based on Shirley Jackson's creepy tale titled The haunting of Hill House it has little in common with the novel . Stirring and exciting musical score fitting to terror by the veteran maestro Jerry Goldsmith . Very good and colorful cinematography by Karl Walter Lindellaub . Director Jan De Bont created a taut drama where the real question is who is haunted and who may be unstable.The picture is middling realized in his thirdtime as director by Jan De Bont a successful cameraman Basic Instict Die Hard and Paul Verhoveen's ordinary photographer and occasionally director Speed  Twister. The film will appeal to Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta Jones fans. This is a chilling adaptation from Shirley Jackson's novel based on an assortment of ghouls and ghosts and gets a mediocre rating . It turns out to be a chiller with all the FX budget can be created  being lavishly produced but also contains several scenes in little sense and no logic.".

De Bont is a terrific creator of suspense and camera setups. All his hard work as a cinematographer paid off in movies such as these. He really knows how to build up an atmosphere accompanied by subtle visual effects and sound design. The way that big house groans and 'breathes' just makes my heart beat faster. Equally great is Jerry Goldsmith's score. In some scenes when combined with the atmospheric sound effects it made my neckhair stand up. I was genuinely terrified. A special mention must go to the art direction and set decoration. The house has such wonderful and at the same time disturbing architecture the thought of having to spend a night there gives me the chills. About the acting I thought it was nothing special. The Haunting is a solely audiovisual experience where acting is only of secondary importance. In short I enjoyed this movie and didn't think the ending was bad.  I see about 200300 movies each year and I see a lot of bad ones but this is not one of them. Go see it and decide for yourself.".

This film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it. Yet many viewers can accept out of control films like Scream because knife killers are more easy to believe for most people than demons or ghosts.  Actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great.  I have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time. The director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the 6th sense.  The Haunting lets go and is certainly not boring.  Perhaps this film might appeal more to John Carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure.  The old Haunting was also a fine film from 1963.  It was even more scary.  See both and also The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin.".

On paper she should be perfect for the role of Nell and for much of the film she provokes the necessary sympathy. She seems unable however to scream properly instead letting what sounds like an animal cry. Also she seems to say Oh No in exactly the same tone of voice every time she sees something frightening although to be fair this is as much the fault of the script as it is hers.Towards the end the atmosphere is slightly diluted by such things as having the beds and statues spring to life which makes these scenes much less frightening than they could be.In spite of all this this movie has a certain something that regardless of it's faults makes me want to watch it again and again and ultimately you can't ask much more from a film than that.".

De Bont who did a competent job with a fastpaced action movie like Speed is unable to craft a sinister atmosphere relying instead on the patented whispering children shtick and on cheesy CGI ghosts the psychological terror of Shirley Jackson's novel becomes subpar horror schlock. Too bad because production design at least did a commendable job the set for Hill House looks effective a humongous tasteless unsettling Gothic manor. Even a magnetic actor like Neeson seems bored. Taylor starts well enough as the vulnerable Nell but then lapses into histrionics. Others aren't given much to do with Wilson as the comic relief and ZetaJones as the eye candy sadly no Entrapmentlike tight jumpsuits here.The Haunting has plot holes so big you could drive a truck through them a sign of blatant disrespect towards the audience. My favorite is how the survivors at the end don't bother to mention to the returning caretakers that THERE IS A BEHEADED CORPSE IN THE CHIMNEY.

	schema:reviewBody "Being a fan of pretty much all four of the main actors in this movie some more than others I was looking forward to seeing THE HAUNTING. After seeing the very coollooking graphics that were on the commercials I was even more excited. Unfortunately I found that I had already seen most of the bestlooking graphics on the commercials. I didn't find the movie too scary but it was spooky at some parts.Dr. David Marrow Liam Neeson wants to perform experiments using human guinea pigs to learn about human fear. He takes three subjects Theo Catherine ZetaJones Luke Sannerson Owen Wilson and Nelle Vance Lili Taylor who believe that the tests are about insomnia to a giant mansion. The mansion has a scary history and some very creepy rooms decorations and gargoyles. The subjects come to learn that the mansion truly is haunted though Dr. Marrow thinks it is just part of his experiment. Soon the four have to struggle to survive the night and get out of the mansion alive.The story line is fairly interesting but this movie is overlong and tends to get boring at parts. The computer effects are fantastic but they aren't shown enough until the end and most of those effects you probably saw on previews and commercials.Catherine ZetaJones stole the show playing an extremely sexy bisexual. Liam Neeson did a fair job but he does tend to go into spurts of overacting. Owen Wilson does well as the comic relief and Lili Taylor did an OK job as the first woman to notice the mystery of the mansion. All characters are very different and it is fascinating to see how they all react to the haunted mansion.This movie is definitely worth a rent. You might be bored at some parts but the action is good and the ending is fair. Go enjoy.".

After seeing the very coollooking graphics that were on the commercials I was even more excited. Unfortunately I found that I had already seen most of the bestlooking graphics on the commercials. I didn't find the movie too scary but it was spooky at some parts.Dr. David Marrow Liam Neeson wants to perform experiments using human guinea pigs to learn about human fear. He takes three subjects Theo Catherine ZetaJones Luke Sannerson Owen Wilson and Nelle Vance Lili Taylor who believe that the tests are about insomnia to a giant mansion. The mansion has a scary history and some very creepy rooms decorations and gargoyles.

	schema:reviewBody "This poor remake of the 1963 classic starts reasonably well then replaces suspense with muddled and pointless special effects.  For example in the original one of the most chilling moments occurs when Nell and Theo are lying side by side in twin beds listening in terror to the noises outside their room.  Nell tells Theo to let go of her hand because she is hurting her.  Nell then looks across at Theo who is several feet away and realises that it was not Theo holding her hand. In the latest version Nell is lying alone in bed when suddenly she dives out and slides across the floor.  It is only when she tells the unseen force to stop pulling her that we realise what has happened.  And can anybody explain what Nell's final words mean  It's about family.  It's always been about family?The one redeeming feature is Lili Taylor's performance but even this cannot save the film.  Catherine ZetaJones demonstrates once again that beneath her pretty exterior there is little depth.  In the original Claire Bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion.  ZetaJones however has to spell it out for example by asking Nell if she has a boyfriend  or girlfriend.Definitely one which should be consigned to the pointless remakes graveyard.".

Nothing is far too complicated here and it makes for a pleasurable experience. It's an awe to watch the scenes unfold in this film...the images are hidden dialogues for themselves and this saves the audience from overanalyzing things.

The script is terrible because a guy gets his head chopped off and Elanor the one who dies saving the kids says oh no. The acting is wooden the effects are crap and the set is a couple off rooms used over and over again. Basically if you like laughing at badly made films watch it but if your looking for a scare then definitely give this film a miss. I was extremely disappointed when I watched this.

The script credited to David Self based on the novel 'The Haunting of Hill House' by Shirley Jackson had a rewrite done on it by script doctor Michael Tolkin  maybe the reason it's a bit of a lightweight mess is because two separate writers worked on it at different times maybe. The characters are dull  unoriginal with virtually no development at all I didn't care about anyone except ZetaJones  even then only because she's a bit of a looker... The ghost story itself is weak big bad ghost wants to kill everyone  generally be evil while one character has a sort of sixth sense to know what's going on while the others don't. It's all rather predictable yawn. The Haunting is at it's best at the beginning when it relies on noises spooky goings on  an air of mystery but unfortunately The Haunting then descends into a succession of CGI ghosts  special effects which are not scary in the slightest from this point it's downhill all the way to the obligatory happy ending. On a positive note it moves along at a fair pace it has a few decent sequences  it kept me entertained for it's duration. The one area where The Haunting does excel is with it's production design credited to Eugenio Zanetti which is both a wonderful asset but at the same time a problem. While the film undeniably looks sumptuous with some truly fantastic  grandiose sets which create a certain atmosphere I couldn't stop thinking that this was indeed a film I was watching something very manmade it all looks very fake  overblown. Technically The Haunting is topnotch  very polished throughout. There is no violence or gore besides a quick bloodless decapitation this is family friendly horror all the way. The acting is pretty bad by all involved Neeson looks embarrassed Wilson is a crap actor whatever he's in  The Haunting's only saving grace is the delicious ZetaJones  her thigh high boots... The Haunting is a passable time waster of a film there's nothing deep or meaningful here but it kept me quiet for a couple of hours. Everyone seems to hate it but I think it's just about worth a watch definitely not the worst horror film I've seen but definitely not the best either.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Grusinsky family is a family of cops father Bert is Deputy Chief and son Joe is Captain. However son Bobby has shunned this side of the family and to Bert's chagrin is using his mother's maiden name and is running a club in Brooklyn mixing with those who see the police as a joke and the city as theirs. As a result the family is split with neither willing to see the others' point of view. When Joe leads a raid on Booby's club and picks up several men of a highprofile Russian mobster the outcome is bloodshed  with a hit put out on Joe. With the Russians unaware of the family connection Bobby must decide who he stands with and the risks he is willing to take for his family.We Own the Night came and went in the cinemas over here and struck me as being one of those thrillers that gets made that is solid enough to watch but not remarkable enough to do really well. This was enough to make me check it out anyway though and it turned out to be pretty much what it appeared to be in the overview. This is no bad thing though because a solid thriller is still a solid thriller and sometimes that is a welcome relief from all the noisy superficial blockbusters handed to us week in week out. Set in the 1980's the film does recall the cop thrillers of the 1970's to a certain point and it does feel like an old fashioned film in terms of the characters and the way it is shot and the rather grey and oppressive feel to the city of the time does lend itself to the narrative.It's not a film of gripping tension though. There are several really well done scenes that are unbearably tragic and tense the shootout between cars is particularly good but mostly the film takes a slower pace that focuses on the characters. It is a good direction to go but the problem is that Gray allows it all to get just that bit too sombre and heavy and it does have an impact on the film in regards slowing it down somewhat. This seems to have been passed onto the cast as well who are generally restrained in their emotions  again not a massive criticism but it does feel a bit like all these factors are weighing down the film to a certain extent. Phoenix impresses despite this and he does convince in his character even if he himself comes over like he has a weight on his shoulders that is crushing him I get that that is part of his character but again it adds this sense of slowness to proceedings. Wahlberg is underused and has too little time and opportunity to make the most of his character  he is very much a supporting player. Duvall is better because his presence adds more and the lack of time doesn't take away from him as he does what he has to do. I enjoyed seeing Mendes doing more than being her usual foxy and a bit playful self  trust me I do love her in that mode but she is capable of more. Gray and his cinematographer provide style when it matters but I think he is mostly responsible for the rather heavy feel to the entire film and it does rather suck the energy out of the film.I'm not suggesting that this film should have been zingy and fun but just that it is sombre to the point of being a bit too much like hard work at times. In terms of content characters and themes I found that it all worked but that this sense of weight did affect it. Still a solid film that is dramatically satisfying in an old fashioned way but these issues do prevent it being as memorable as it could have been.".

Reminds me of The Godfather not just the movie but the way the audience enjoyed it. Only reason I didn't give it a 10 was I don't give most movies at 10 unless they're like The Searcher or Vetigo. Again I don't want to give away too much about the movie because I hate now how everyone knows everything about a movie's plot before it opens. Let's just say it's both a crime movie and a family drama. A socially conscious melodrama and a cop story. And it has a couple of great action scenes. The acting was top notch by Joaquin Phoenix Mark Wahlberg better than in The Departed Robert Duvall always good and especially Eva Mendes who I've never seen like this before. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a real disappointment especially if you enjoy most of the past performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Wahlberg. Both actors have built a fine body of work and Robert Duvall is one of the finest actors working today. However We Own the Night fell short in so many areas I had to offset the otherwise love fest other users are having with this movie. You could blame the script as the dialog was weak in spots and uninspired throughout. Phoenix' character who is both son and brother to New York cops has chosen a different path. But very unfortunate circumstances lead to his immediate entry into the police force as a parole officer where he instantly becomes the Defacto boss of the narcotics division. Prior to this though he is placed into protective custody but is allowed to go back to his nightclub or the apartment of his girlfriends mother and to even walk the streets if he sees fit. Duvalls character is always either mad at one son or the other and frequently makes boneheaded decisions and statements that keep sending Phoenix further along a downward spiral of hopelessness and self loathing. Wahlberg plays a role that is both under developed and boring. You could blame the direction especially during the last 30 minutes of the movie. What did start as a unique story with a convincing amount of tension slowly falls apart and at the end becomes laughable. The ending is so anti climatic that it too becomes comical. As Phoenix and team are tracking the movie's arch nemesis through a field of reeds he calls off the search orders a retreat and sets the field on fire. The team waits for the smoke and flames to flush the bad guy when Phoenix goes back into the field. Impervious to heat and smoke he hears a rustle and drops our villain with a single blind shot to the heart. The bad dude utters Bobby Phoenix's character and dies. But wait it's not over there! Phoenix dramatically pun indeed intended exits through the smoke to find all the other cops now well away from the field and encircling the venerable handcuffed mastermind of the movie no need to get too much into detail it would further ruin the silliness and humor of the moment.The movie does have merits as I said. It is a period piece and does do the nightlife of 1988 justice. The violence is gritty and there is a lot of tension built up as the story unfolds. Nevertheless these cannot overcome the many short falls and agony that one must endure. You will be thankful when credits roll at the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "WE OWN THE NIGHT is the quote from the lower portion of the badge on the uniforms of NYPD police family Deputy Chief Bert Grusinsky Robert Duvall and one of his two sons Capt. Joe Grusinsky Mark Wahlberg the other son Bobby Joaquin Phoenix did not follow the family tradition of police work but instead is involved in nightclubs  and yes there is a schism of resentment. Bobby has distanced himself further from his family by changing his last name to 'Green' living with a Puerto Rican girl Amada Eva Mendes and bonding to a wealthy Russian family who owns the nightclub where Bobby works  a front for a drug dealing business. WriterDirector James Gray 'The Yards' and 'Little Odessa' has a feel for this underbelly of New York City and captures the 1988 mood of life in the city and beneath the city with style. The problem with the story is that it has been done so many times that it is simply stale yesterday's lunch. Two brothers at opposite end of the family spectrum require a major tragedy to bring them together and to offer any more information to this fairly thin plot would be a disservice to those who plan to see the film.The cast is strong partly because each of them has played similar roles countless times and have the ideas down pat. It should be noted that two of the producers of the film are Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix probably a reason the film was made... There are some exciting moments and enough surprises and tense times to keep the adrenaline rolling the smaller roles are very well cast and one of the shining attributes of the film is the gorgeous Russian liturgy inspired musical score by Wojciech Kilar. It is not a bad film it is just too much in the same mold as countless other New York police dramas. Grady Harp".

	schema:headline " This film deserves to own one or two of your nights";
	schema:reviewBody "James Gray's work here as writerdirector has come leaps and bounds from his previous film The Yards released in 2000. With We Own the Night he crafts a fantastic story with a style set apart from current films. Perhaps not designed for audiences that fear classical storytelling this film is refreshingly not reminiscent of the music videosvideo games that are being packaged as movies. Gray has likened it to a Greek tragedy in its scope where something far more devastating than predictability awaits. After a much discussed sex scene that manages to be risqu and sexy without going too far for tame audiences the story really develops beautifully exceeding my already high expectations. I'm looking forward to seeing it for a second time in theaters as I have a feeling that this one only improves with multiple viewings.Gray creates real mood in several particularly excellent scenes. Two in particular the drug house and car chase are so well constructed and so well filmed. They build tension inconspicuously they creep up on you to where you barely notice that you've started breathing harder. And the choice of composition and sound effects never feels overdone or out of place. It serves as a compliment to the suspense rather than the source. At times the effect almost sounds throbbingly ultrasonic. It adds palpability to scenes without overpowering themsomething all too common today.Of particular mention is Gray's use of hallways as set pieces. There are three different hallways used at different intervals in the film that are wonderfully atmospheric as coupled with haunting audio and skillful direction and indicative of a passage into the unknown. The lastBobby walking down the corridor into blackness is both terrifying in its context and foretelling of the symbolic darkness he's entering in his life.As for the cast Joaquin Phoenix is again the heart soul and center of the film. Smartly given the main role his weight conviction and charisma easily stand out here. Conversely Mark Wahlberg contributes little and provides the same fairly onenote performance we've seen before from him. But perhaps aided by their previous working relationship and offscreen friendship he and Phoenix share enough believable chemistry to make their complicated relationship feel real. Duvall does fine work as their father we've seen him better but I enjoyed the tension between his character and Phoenix's black sheep of the family. Eva Mendes is unobjectionable as well. Actually the relationship between Bobby Phoenix and Amada Mendes is perhaps the most touching and poignant in the film and Mendes is in no way a disappointment or distraction. More than just the girlfriend of a charismatic man we believe in the relationship between Amada and Bobby which makes the evolution of that relationship all the more resonant by film's end. But this is Phoenix's film. At his worst if you can call it that he's reminiscent of a young and passionate Al Pacino and at his best there is no one comparable. Phoenix takes this role and makes it heartbreaking shading Bobby with sympathy and complexity. There are several scenes in which his reactions are stunning in their realism. A scene in a diner in which Bobby knows more than he can let on to a Russian drug dealer Phoenix juggles a reflection of both inner and outer conflict that is revelatory in its subtletyand he does it all with his face and eyes. He seems an old hand at the dreaded and difficult character arc so his masterful work there is no surprise. What is surprising is that you instantly forget ever seeing him in anything before. When you watch We Own the Night you can't see Joaquin Phoenix and you don't see any character he has previously played. His style presence manner behavior and the feeling he projects has never been seen before. This is Phoenix as we've never seen him. And that is every bit as exciting as it sounds.As a final comment on the filmmaking the very last scene is a dream in its power and simplicity. Though some viewers may be used to something showier it is about as perfect a final moment as I could have hoped for. As far as Joaquin Phoenix goes the man just keeps getting better. Apparently so does James Gray.".

Those are professional hit men for you...at least in the mind of the cretin who crafted this silly story. Of course Bobby the club manager is the guy who shoots the bad guy who's last word is Bobby for some reason then we go to the final scene where he's graduating from the academy as promised and guess what he's the valedictorian. Wow! No middle of the class for this screenwriter. Oh and the single tear running down Bobby's eye when he goes in to see his brother in the hospital was priceless.Numerous other silly examples of unbelievable scripting are peppered throughout the film but they are too numerous to list.In summary If you can completely suspend all rational belief and you are easily entertained by people doing things that no human being who has survived to adulthood would ever do then this movie is for you.".

The characters are shaped well and embodied perfectly by the actors although Mark Wahlberg is really just playing the quiet aggressive guy that he's always playing once more. There's a pretty exciting car chase in there and a bugging operation that will make you cringe with fear for the main character.That said the movie isn't without its flaws. The first half drags on a bit then it all goes too fast. Joaquin Phoenix' character becomes a policeman literally overnight and suddenly there's a concluding showdown which comes out of nowhere and ends with a pretty unspectacular shootout. On top of that most of the movie plays like a sequence of short episodes rather than one continuous story. Phoenix' character is too much in the focus of the story and the characters played by Eva Mendes and Mark Wahlberg just kind of enter and leave the plot without having too much of an impact on anything.Make no mistake though this is one of the best gangster movies of 2007 just after Eastern Promises and way ahead of American Gangster although it is much closer in atmosphere to David Fincher's characterdriven Zodiac. And Joaquin Phoenix is so good he was robbed of an Academy Awards nomination.".

I'm quite serious when it comes to quality but really how Hollywood made me waste my time and money lately is huh well sick. But here comes Mr. Gray owning the night bringing hope and relief from the darkness.We own the night is for sure not original in its screenplay. The bad boy who becomes good in loyalty towards his family the tough guy who decides to kill the evil he was making a living on to save his family. Even though he's never been a dealer still he's somehow mixed with all the drug issues going on in the club he works at. The man who turns out to have a conscience that leads him to pick up a side between the good and the evil.But after all what's wrong with a predictable screenplay? I'm not sure you can blame a movie for that single reason at least not nowadays. There are way too many movies coming out to judge one only by its storyline. Then what makes the difference is the acting part the ability of the actors to get into the character to make the character become alive alive as a character  not an actor playing a role but a role played by an actor. That's where the truth lies...and I'm afraid this is something that everyone forgets because the acting is of very poor quality most of the time. It is certainly the director that is to blame but the actor what is the actor doing if he doesn't try hard to get into the character himself? Joaquin Phoenix is very good at it. Very good. In my opinion he's one of the most talented actors of his generation my favorite undoubtedly. He's always great  as a Roman emperor or as Johnny Cash. He was good in UTurn and The Yards too. But in We own the night he's simply amazing. He brings about a high dose of emotion he's complex and tortured. He makes his character so deep. Robert Duvall won an award but honestly the best actor in the movie is Phoenix. I didn't find Duvall extraordinary. He's just this old guy proud proud and disappointed proud and worried then proud and relieved but still worried finally proud and dead. I'm sure he could have been better. As for Mark Whalberg I don't really like him as an actor. I always feel that he's never really into his role I think it's just his face...what can you do. As people compare those two movies I would say he was better in The Departed. Then again he's not OK in We own the night. Finally Eva Mendes. She's surprising. Perfect as the girl who's outofplace who's truly in love but overwhelmed by the direction her life his taking and that she's not strong enough to follow.On top of that the movie is beautifully shot. Some scenes are extremely touching like the one where Phoenix goes to the hospital to see his brother after he got shot this tear falling out on his cheek...You can literally FEEL the pain and you cannot help being somehow moved. The other beautiful scene is when Duvall dies. First getting dreadfully shot in the car in font of Phoenix. Then Duvall coming out of the car halfdead under the heavy rain his son watching him die almost like a second time but this time for good. Another scene that is quite quite original is the march into the cocaine fabric. You follow Phoenix steps as you literally freak out along with him. You're not sure what's going to happen the atmosphere is so gloomy and tensed but you know nothing good can happen there. It's like a hell resort it reminded me of the house in Fight Club. Finally the last scene between the two brothers is a perfect end with a bit of regret for the lost lover the last and only regret of a previous existence.I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a change who wants to see actors playing the characters of an non flawed screenplay.".

As the film progresses Bobby is forced to choose between staying loyal to his drug dealing Boss or siding with his family.The greatest problem with this film is that its been done so many times before and with much better results. Mean Streets 1973 The Departed 2006 to name but a few. Director James Gray is obviously trying to do a Scorsese type feature here but it falls far short of expectations.Joaquin Phoenix mumbles his way through the story with a one note performance and shows that he isn't capable of being a credible lead. The change his character goes through is implausible and Phoenix never gives you any reason to believe the metamorphosis as he doesn't act any differently through the whole process. The Script gives Robert Duvall one of my favourite actors little to do other than get angry at someone or something whenever he's on screen and Mark Wahlberg underplays his part so much that he's actually boring. The stunning Eva Mendes doesn't seem to do anything significant other than get groped in the opening scene by Phoenix. After that she seems to be there to provide the eye candy only.The script is fairly weak and the plot does not justify the running time 30 minutes less could easily have been achieved. There are also many situations that the characters get themselves into which no sensible adult would allow themselves to. This really stretches credibility and suspension of disbelief. Also you'll particularly enjoy how inept the Hitmen are in this film ! The final showdown itself feels contrived and unexciting which caps off an uneven and somewhat thrown together production. I don't understand the rapturous applause that other reviewers have given this film its been done so much better elsewhere.We own the night is a misfire in my opinion.".

Forget all the positive reviews the only decent bits were the blurry car chase and the scene where Joaquin Phoenix goes to the Russian mob's den and gets found out.A hilarious continuity cut at the start put me in the mood for the film though. Eva Mendes is having her bean flicked by Joaquin one minute she's got tights on the next they disappear! Hey Presto Joaquin is a wizard!! After that the film just doesn't deliver. I spent the whole time comparing it to films it's like which are better like The Departed and Carlito's Way. Mr Phoenix looks like he's on Temazepam he wanders through the film in a daze disinterested and tired he acts like he's just come out of an Eat as much as you can Chinese Buffet shouldn't have had that 3rd plate Joaquin.Mark Whalberg drifts in and out of the film with the enthusiasm of somebody who's just read such an appalling script. Robert Duvall is solid but dull. There are plenty of contrived exchanges that drag the film down. And Joaquin's transformation from night club manager to gun toting cop belongs in the realm of Science Fiction.The guy who plays Jumbo gives one of the most shocking performances in the history of cinema. He acts in that genericpseudocool gangster way but his execution is diabolical and to top it all you get the feeling that the actor playing the role actually thinks he's doing a great job! I think he should retire.Not very good at all.".

The two brothers who have chosen opposite paths is an old story never the less this is a slightly more up to date twist on this theme with Bobby Joaquin ultimately finding the path of true light at the end. Unfortunately by the time Bobby does see the light I have already become so bored that I am not bothered about the outcome.In places it is difficult to hear Phoenix because he seems to mumble and talk out the side of his mouth which is very distracting to say the least. As for Wahlberg this film just shows us more of his dire acting abilities anybody remember Planet of the Apes 2001 this guy is so dull even he falls asleep through some of his boring dialogue!Robert Duvall who plays Deputy Chief Albert 'Bert' Grusinsky a hugely talented actor who at the age of 76 years yes 76 years is given a part that expects us to suspend belief that he is the father of these two men who in fact are young enough to be his grand children! Duvall is a great actor who should have stayed clear of this travesty unfortunately he is one of the best actors in this film without even trying!Back to the plot the film outline in short is this. Two brothers Phoenix and Wahlberg choose different lifestyles one follows in his father's Duvall footsteps as a police officer the other a nightclub manager with links to the Russian mafia. A nephew within in the Russian family scary man with a ponytail is plotting to flood the city with class 'A' drugs angel dust. Wahlberg and Duvall try to enlist Phoenix to spy on the mob. Wahlberg is shot and takes months to recover. Wayward brother helps cops by spying on the mob. After spying on the mob wayward son is now on the run from the mob scary man with a ponytail. The father is killed during a protracted chase sequence. Wayward son unbelievably JOINS the police force to get retribution on his father's death. Film ends with brothers saying 'I love you' during Bobby's graduation from police academy.As I touched on earlier the film starts out well with a realistic script that is somewhat formulaic but believable! During the proof reading of the second half someone must have got bored and nodded off because reality just got thrown out of the window. How would a drug taking nightclub manager ever get drafted into the police? Watching the credits roll I saw that Phoenix and Wahlberg were producers in this movie! Perhaps the film should have been called 'We Own the Script'.A little too indulgent overall could have been better served by objective editing.".

	schema:reviewBody "After reading the New Yorker review I decided to see this movie. What a farce. Joaquin Phoenix trudges through this movie like he's on the Burmese Death March. All the characters appear to be slightly green  the DP must have been someone's brother. Was this supposed to make the actors look gritty? They looked seasick instead.The story is stupid. Marky Mark a Brooklyn Cop warns brother Phoenix a Nightclub manager that the nightclub Phoenix manages is going to be raided  one of the patrons the nephew of the nightclub's owner is a major Russian drug kingpin. The next night the club is indeed raided to Phoenix's surprise and rage. The huge velvetcovered club is full of people who are apparently so drugged out that when the cops finally wade through into the crowd of hundreds most have not dropped their stashes. Oh OK. And the drug Kingpin nephew of the Russian nightclub owner has nothing on him. I guess the cops were hoping he'd have his entire stash in his pants.Phoenix is so mad after the club is raided! Even though his cop brother told him the night before the raid that the cops were coming! And the Uncle knows nothing of his nephew's drug dealing! The cops ask the uncle Does your nephew have an office here in the nightclub and the uncle answers No! That's gritty police work! And then the Russians try to kill Marky Mark  they try to shoot him in the brain from one inch away but miss! It's the only realistic thing in the movie! Then the Russian drug kingpin decides he wants to build a brand with his coke and decides he's not only going to ask for Phoenix's help but he's going to show Phoenix his entire operation! The drug guys don't know that Phoenix is Marky Mark's brother! How could they  Phoenix is using his mother's maiden name! Phoenix wears a wire unbeknownst to his father who runs the entire department! OK! He takes down the kingpin with amazing physical prowess even though he looks like he'll have a heart attack just walking down the street! Then the Russians kill Phoenix's father! How could it happen! And the Russian kingpin uncle comes to the funeral and stands in front with all the cops and Phoenix's family! The cops have not yet figured out that the Uncle is running the whole thing even though it's his nightclub and his nephew! And the drugs are coming into the country inside fake fur coats! It must be the fake fur that's fooling the drug sniffing dogs! The coke comes out of the coats by dipping the coats in water! Why didn't I think of it! And the 10 year old grandkids are couriers! They must be really strong to carry 88 pounds of cocaine! Those Russian kids are superkids! And all those guys standing around in the middle of the marshes of Brooklyn have machine guns! And the drug kingpin escapes 20 minutes before he's supposed to be taken to trial! And Marky Mark panics when he's supposed to lead the charge! And Joaquin is an expert marksman and full of incredible courage! And it was his best friend who gave him up! And Joaquin pokes his best friend in the eyes. Is he going to gouge those eyes out! I hope so! And is Marky Mark's wife going to smack Joaquin for calling her fat! I hope so! And . . .I don't have the energy to go on. A preposterous movie stupid. At the end Phoenix looked like he was glad the whole thing was over. So was I. I WANT MY 10 BUCKS AND MY 2 HOURS BACK.".

I hope so! And is Marky Mark's wife going to smack Joaquin for calling her fat! I hope so! And . . .I don't have the energy to go on. A preposterous movie stupid. At the end Phoenix looked like he was glad the whole thing was over. So was I. I WANT MY 10 BUCKS AND MY 2 HOURS BACK.";

	schema:reviewBody "A New York club owner has his club raided by cops one night the catch is that one of the cops doing the raiding is his own brother. After his brother his sent to the hospital he takes matters into his own hands to try and catch the ones who did it. His life then is turned upside down as he must look over his shoulder at every turn or turn the tables on those after him.I wasn't all that interested in We Own The Night. Granted it had a good cast a competent director and a decent story line the trailers just never grabbed me. Nevertheless I gave it a try and it is exactly what I thought it would be a decent film with great acting and good directing. We Own The Night is no Departed which is what many people will compare this to as it came out the year prior and bare similar plot scenarios. We Own The Night is a decent film that can stand on it's own but it's lackluster ending and stages where it drags on a bit stop it from being a film that might be remembered years from now.Bobby is a night club owner and his brother Joesph is the cop that raids his place. Joesph is after one man and one man only Vadim. Vadim decides to send this cop a message and has him killed but Joesph survives the attack. Bobby decides to take matters into his own hands go undercover and stop Vadim from his drug running. Things don't go as smooth as planned and then we have a big shoot out in the drug building. This scene along with a unique car chase scene later on stand out as highlights in a film that is mostly talk. The car chase is unique in it's own right because most of it is done within the car only briefly going outside to show the viewer where they are headed. It's pouring rain and the one sound that you cannot help but hear it the windshield wipers going back and forth trying to give us a clear view of what's going on but it's never clear enough for long.Bobby is the main character played by Phoenix with Wahlberg playing the brother in a more supporting role. Eva Mendes and Robert Duvall round out the rest of the cast both hold up well with what they have. Surprisingly Mendes who has a real performance here. She genuinely loves Bobby and doesn't want to see him get hurt. Duvall the father always liked the one son more then the other mostly because the son was following in his footsteps. With the small screen time both characters have they manage to change drastically. Both in the opposite direction one grows closer while the other further apart. Wahlberg does well with his role he doesn't have any material to work with other then to be angry here and kind there. This film belongs to Phoenix. A powerful performance is in the film and Phoenix delivers on every level. Bobby is a complex individual we never truly know what he is thinking or believes. He is rolling with the bad guys and tells his family to screw off yet will run to their aid when needed. Phoenix delivers this performance mainly through his eyes. In one particular scene he is told about his brothers attempted murder and the man telling him is the man who did it. Phoenix plays both sides of the spectrum perfectly well hiding his true emotions to the other character yet showing everything to the viewer.Gray uses light and sound to his advantage here. When one character dies the main thing we hear is silence with the exception of the rain hitting the floor. Gray also likes to use hallways for instance when Bobby is about to enter the drug operations room. He travels down a dark a brooding hallway into the darkness he goes into the danger that lies ahead. The film is never too bright or too dark it has mid grays and blues throughout. It's set back in the 70's and this feeling achieved right from the opening pictures.The final climatic showdown is what brings this film down a notch. A good premise with bad execution is what happened. Two characters are traveling through a marsh field one is after the other the suspense is building...then we all of a sudden stop and set the marsh on fire. We are waiting for this one guy to come out and give up all suspense is gone but then Bobby decides to go back in so we are suppose to go back in with him. They've already brought us in and taken us out now they want us to go back on this journey with them. The second time we enter the suspense has settled and the scene doesn't last long enough to try and rebuild it. It's over before it begins. Some plot holes also hurt We Own The Night like how some people know they are brothers yet others have no clue. It would seem like someone would have known something beforehand.All in all We Own The Night is a good film I can recommend it to you. It has great performances especially from Phoenix and good directing. IF the story was a little tighter and the final ten minutes more suspenseful We Own The Night would be one everyone's top ten list instead it might have to sit at the next number out. Which is a shame cause this film is worthy of praise.".

He is one of the best underrated directors today. However don't come to the theater expecting to see an unofficial Departed sequel. You won't see it because this movie has a different style and flow. It's not as action packed as The Departed. This movie does not need a ton of action to hold your attention though. We Own The Night focuses on it's characters and their relationships in order to hold your attention. You will see some action but don't come into this movie expecting to see Die Hard or The Departed. If you come into the movie expecting to see a deep look into how characters deal with life changing events you will not be disappointed. Overall this movie deserves a solid 9.".

	schema:headline " Dull boring and awful";
	schema:reviewBody "Lately the movies have just been awful. We Own the Night is no exception. This movie has several fatal flaws to it. It's characters are terribly contrived the acting is poor and the storyline is nonsensical and boring. First the characters in the movie do not feel real and are terribly out of place. Joaquin's character Bob? is a night club manager. His character goes from hard core partying night club manager to police officer. Wahlberg and Duvall are the brother and dad of Joaquin and they're cops. They share no chemistry as fatherson their relationship with Bob as their son doesn't stand out at all. The three have no chemistry on screen as a family. No attempt whatsoever is made to develop these characters. Wahlberg's and Mende's characters are absurd and bad to the point of being ridiculous. We have Wahlberg who is a narco cop yet becomes a silly pansy in the face of adversity. We have Mendes a hottie actress intent on doing nothing but talking about her mom during the movie. The acting is poor all the way around. Joaquin's character Bob seems to mutter incomprehensible sentences during the entire movie and seems like a nervous schoolboy during the entire move. He is always walking around as if he has a back problem. Seriously notice how the guy appears hunched over whenever he does anything in this movie. The way Phoenix puts together sentences is simply atrocious. Duvall adds literally nothing to this lame drama he is an old guy who like anthony hopkins attempts to portray roles that he could execute 20 years ago but not today. Also he just lacks charisma why the heck would a cop dad be so mad at his son for simply managing a night club? We are never given a reason why Duvall dislikes Bob managing the cluballegedly its because there are bad guys there? But bad guys are everywhere in life. It just doesn't make sense. Which leads me to my next point.Which is that the storyline is awful and makes little sense. Even in 1988 or whenever this takes place if cops are being dropped like flies in big city one thing you can count on is absurd federal government involvement. We are led to believe that it's three cops versus an empire of Russian mafia. Please. During the chase scene we have a car disappear with no explanation. We have the chief of police getting axed by himself with no back up. There are no other cops. We have a runaway cop killer who escapes and then stays in the area to do a drug deal with his uncle who owns the club and knows his nephew is a wanted drug dealer. Would you as a major drug dealer let your runaway cop killing nephew join you in the city where he killed a cop in a major drug deal? No. Further during the drug bust raid we have cops just sitting there in high grass calling out to major drug lords to stop thus encouraging said drug dealers to shoot them. Yea. Further we have said cops in high grass yelling at drug lords with assault rifles whilst not wearing head protection. Yea. Then we have the Russian uncle who is partaking in major drug dealing with said runaway felon nephew. Further you have duvall and wahlberg approaching Phoenix and getting mad at him for managing a club that appears pretty lucrative. Hmm. Then you have them mad at him for uh being around bad people I guess? Though we're never quite let on to why Phoenix is so hated by his cop family. The fact that a drug dealer attends a night club is hardly a reason to hate the person for managing the night club. Then we have a police force which consists apparently of like four cops versus the Russian mafia with no one else participating. The car chase is the only scene which I liked because it seemed real. No loud obnoxious music geared towards the MTV crowd rather just an accurate description of cars chasing each other in rainy New York. Overall this movie was incredibly bad and the acting and storyline were awful. The actors were not very good and I wish Hollywood could take the approach that great looks does supersede acting in the movie business. Do not feel obliged to cast hotties when they lack the ability to act.".

There is no real reason to care about who they are and what they do therefore by about half way through you don't care if they kill anyone including themselves. It reminds me Mystic River which is another pile of garbage. Don't bother with that either. Its full of clichs and good looking people. The cinematography is way to slick. Its like an advert but way more vacuous. With lines like Baby your gonna be killed and Its gonna be OK well your 5 year old could have written this and would have made far superior job.".

The film traces a week in these immigrants' lives blurring the line between their characters' routines and their own. Every morning Tarzan Eddy Constantine and Edward G.

	schema:reviewBody "'Moi un Noir' is an important cinematic document by renowned French anthropologist and filmmaker Jean Rouch. It is highly significant because it has been acclaimed not only as one of Rouch's finest works of 'ethnofiction' but has also quoted as one of the inspirations for the films of the French Nouvelle Vague. JeanLuc Godard has quoted this as being one of his biggest influences the central characters have much in common with his protagonists in features such as 'A bout de souffl' and 'Le Petit soldat'. They are unsure of where they are or where they are going.During the Second World War Rouch had served as an engineer in Africa and he became fascinated with the lives of African immigrants in France and its colonies. From 1947 onwards he had engaged in producing a countless number of films about African life. These films attempted to capture the everyday lives of residents in Niger Mali and Ghana. He was interested not just in the effects of colonisation on the young of the countries but also in looking at the contradiction in life between the young in France and those in these colonies.'Moi un Noir' chronicles the everyday life of several young Africans in Treichville  a poor section in Abidjan the largest city in the Ivory Coast. These men are immigrants from Niger who have travelled to this large city in order to become successful. The central character is Edward G. Robinson who speaks to the audience in a voiceover narration which gives the film its unique style. Throughout the film there is a sense that the young protagonists wish to be somewhere else but are unable to get anywhere. It seems however that the residents of Treichville are much the same with the sections of town being called New York and Chicago.These young men are also people who long to be somebody else. The central characters in the film are named after famous 'toughguy' actors such as Edward G. Robinson and Eddie Constantine. The kids talk like these tough guys but their encounters with others repeatedly tells us that they are a far cry from their heroes. The film also follows 'Robinson' in his attempts to find a mate and the problems which arise as a result.'Moi un Noir' is a fascinating film and acts as a snapshot of what life was like for those residents of the colony in that decisive time between the war and independence. In addition it is highly recommended if you are interested in the history of 'cinema verite' or the ethnographic film.".

Their vulnerabilities are in the open and they deal with each other as best they can.  Kline's son is confused about more than his sexuality far more.  His first girlfriend accepts him and more importantly her own sexuality with a maturity in no way undermined by a delightfully playful demeanor. As in similar films the viewer has to suspend reality when the doomed character accepts his fate with no mention of palliative much less curative medical intervention.  His condition is never fully described but a quick distant shot of murmuring doctors examining xrays xrays? No MRIs CAT scans or PET scans in a CA hospital? brings home that the architectural model builder has hit a brick wall.The cast is firstrate  everyone plays hisher role convincingly.The message of the film is of course the enduring need for community. And this celluloid community is moving and loving.  A truly fine film. Yep I cried into my popcorn.".

He'd better not go down the road of Kevin Kline's teenage kid or I'll kill him! just kiddingdon't call Child Protective Services just yet.California Cinematic Dreamin' aside the people here are real.  Their vulnerabilities are in the open and they deal with each other as best they can.  Kline's son is confused about more than his sexuality far more.  His first girlfriend accepts him and more importantly her own sexuality with a maturity in no way undermined by a delightfully playful demeanor. As in similar films the viewer has to suspend reality when the doomed character accepts his fate with no mention of palliative much less curative medical intervention.  His condition is never fully described but a quick distant shot of murmuring doctors examining xrays xrays? No MRIs CAT scans or PET scans in a CA hospital? brings home that the architectural model builder has hit a brick wall.The cast is firstrate  everyone plays hisher role convincingly.The message of the film is of course the enduring need for community. And this celluloid community is moving and loving.  A truly fine film. Yep I cried into my popcorn.";

If you insist on flashy amusements and naive happy endings in your films this is not for you. If you are real though about the dynamics of our troubled lives then it is for you. And if you are sensitive then this is a film you can only watch about once a year.It is well written directed and acted especially by Kevin Kline and Kristin Scott Thomas. Hayden Christensen gives us the same believable anger sullenness and pathos as his Anakin Skywalker character did in Episode II maybe better. He makes a good troubled teen. And Jena Malone is good with the script she is dealt.I'd recommend this film to anyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Somebody once said that life' is what happens when you're not looking. And it's so true.  Too often we let the years slip by and the important things slip right along with them and it's only when something happens that we start to pay attention and by then it's too late to do anything about it.  The good news however is that as long as you're still breathing there's still a chance to make amends or at least try to.  You can try not to make up for past mistakes and we've all made them but to make today' count which is what a man at a particular juncture in his life discovers and sets out to do in Life As A House' directed by Irwin Winkler and starring Kevin Kline.George Monroe Kline is an architect a man who can design anything with the exception of that which is the most important  His own life.  He has a failed marriage now divorced for ten years from Robin Kristin Scott Thomas a failed relationship with his now sixteenyearold son Sam Hayden Christensen he's getting on in years and he's unhappy which is driven home by circumstances involving his job and his health that make him abruptly sit up and take notice.  His house' literally and figuratively in not in order.  And he decides to do something about it.  He's determined to tear down his old house and rebuild a new one and he begins by arranging for Sam to come and live with him for the summer.  And it will be a summer that will affect not only George and Sam but Robin and a number of others as well a summer in which the trivial things of life are put on hold and for once the important things are embraced.Working from a well written and insightful screenplay by Mark Andrus Winkler delivers a drama that is thoughtful and poignant at times even poetic wonderfully acted and beautifully filmed by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond.  Rich in metaphor it's an engrossing film that works on a number of levels and will appeal to a wide audience many of whom will relate to George and his situation others who will identify with Sam and for some it may hit strikingly too close to home.  Whatever your personal situation is it will fall somewhere within the emotional arc Winkler creates here and if it doesn't now it will eventually.  Because as this film so trenchantly points out life' happens.  And the most important thing is knowing what to do with it if not the first time around then at least before it's too late.He received an Oscar for his portrayal of Otto in the comedy A Fish Called Wanda' but Kevin Kline decidedly hits his stride in dramatic roles  As Nathan in Sophie's Choice' Mack in Grand Canyon' or Ben in The Ice Storm' for example and now here as George Monroe.  Kline brings George believably to life with a performance that hints at who George was but most importantly tells us who he is now.  With understated subtly he conveys his innermost feelings in a way that enables the audience to make that allimportant emotional connection with the character.  He makes you feel as though you know him and once you do and once you meet Robin it's hard to understand what went wrong between them all those years ago.  One can only assume that somewhere along the line youth and a lack of focus took it's toll understandable in a world that bombards us daily with endless stimuli.  And it's one of the subtle perspectives that makes this film so effective.Kristin Scott Thomas gives a convincing performance as well as Robin a woman who has moved on with her life but in whom you can discern a certain dissatisfaction with her current situation.  On the surface her life seems agreeable but we see through her portrayal that it is still lacking in some regard.  She seems happy to some extent but it's more like the unfulfilled happiness that comes when one has settled' for something.  You get the sense that what she has with her current husband Peter Jamey Sheridan is somehow less than what she had with George at least at some point or other. Thomas does a good job of indicating the complexities of her character dipping beneath the surface to make what could have been a onenote character alive and interesting.One of the real rewards of this film however is found in the wonderfully affecting performance of young Hayden Christensen as Sam.  With but a few TV appearances and a handful of unremarkable films to his credit the exception being a part in Sophia Coppola's The Virgin Suicides' Christensen is virtually an unknown but comes through with some extremely impressive work here.  He not only finds but manages to convey that turmoil of confusion and need for personal identity that every teenager experiences and he presents it quite naturally and effectively.  There's nothing feigned or pretentious about him the Sam he delivers comes from somewhere deep down inside and working from the inside out makes him very real and believable.  It's a performance that should jumpstart his career which is about to be catapulted into high gearhigh profile status when Star Wars  Episode 2 Attack of the Clones' hits the screen in which he plays the role of Anakin Skywalker.  And because of the magnitude of that film and all that goes along with it he will never receive the acclaim he deserves no matter how good a job he does in it so it's important that he has this film under his belt which demonstrates what a truly gifted young actor he really is a fact that may be overlooked once Clones' hits which is what happened to Leonardo DiCaprio after Titanic'.  And Christensen's performance here is a big part of what makes Life As A House' a winner.  I rate this one 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was the title that first intrigued me. What could this be about? I had never heard of it. Then I noticed that it starred Kevin Kline. With a title like that and Kline as the star I thought it was perhaps a comedy. I started watching it without really knowing what to expect. It was not what I had expected and I was not disappointed. This was a superb drama with Kline playing a man who has one last chance to reconnect with those he loves and especially with his teenage son Sam Hayden Christensen who has become rebellious and disrespectful and drug addicted and who is tempted to spend his summer as a male prostitute to make some easy money.The story revolves around George's decision to tear down his old shack and to build a beautiful new house. He enlists commands? Sam's help for the project and we watch as the house and the relationship begins to take shape. The journey toward reconciliation in this family is captivating. Kline was absolutely outstanding as George in what must have been one of his finest acting performances and one of the best I've seen in a long time. Christensen was almost as good as Sam. The movie also has a strong supporting cast to help out with folks like Kristin Scott Thomas Mary Steenburgen Jena Malone and Scott Bakula all adding to the story.I found the very beginning of the movie just a bit hard to get into for some reason but once I was into it I was absolutely hooked. There are times of joy and times of sadness and the theme of reconciliation running through the whole movie and dealing not just with the relationship between George and Sam but with various broken relationships is a powerful one. This was a very very pleasant surprise.910".

Christensen ends up being the real revelation here though. He plays a very difficult part and he could have drowned in the role but instead he becomes the production's strongest swimmer. Many shortcomings hurt here but the good things definitely outweigh the bad. 4 stars out of 5.";

This Movie was Harshly Rated I do not believe it should have been Rated R and I hope that the rating has not discouraged anyone from watching it. It is a terrific movie that deals with very real problems in life and the miracle of Change. You have not seen a truly great movie until you have watched this film. Although this movie is an incredibly wellmade Drama it contains lots of humour and comedic elements that make you smile and laugh throughout the film. This movie will leave you with your heart aflutter in your Chest. And the Desire to know more and see more. You Will Truly be left with a feeling of Supreme satisfaction and Dazzlement at how the film played out before your eyes.".

I am understandably an emotional person who has felt the loss of a parent at a young age and i guess it's that in the movie which hits close to home.

In fact I could watch the movie again just to see his performance. Every word he says even if it is a contrived revelation about living life to the fullest or something like that which is the writer's fault not his oozes with humanity and the scene in which he destroys his models after being fired will go down as one of my favorite scenes of all time...that's right... all time. Watch this movie for Kevin.Scott Thomas excellent actress plays the part well you struggle along with her during the emotional rollercoaster sorry for that cringeinducing clich and the one I just used to describe it. Her and Kline make quite the onscreen pair.The metaphor The house... it's SO obvious and in your face but I love it anyway. Tearing it down as well as a lot of tearing downcoping with family history that is explored well in the movie especially in an unbelievable scene between Kline and Christensen that ends beautifully like this... Build this house with me. Incredible.The not so good Christensen I know I know everyone and their dog praises him in this role...I just don't see it. Whiny to the point of nausea...not in that playing the character well way but in a well nauseating way. He is saved by Kline in most scenes. Nothing much to see. And his character changes so quickly and unnaturally which leads me into...The writing The first 75 minutes of the movie are for the most part so beautifully written... witty touching bloody emotional. The rest is filler in my opinion. All issues are resolved easily and predictably. And the ending... I mean come on why? In my head I pretend it was never thereit makes the movie better in hindsight which if I may quote the movie is like foresight without a future. Yeah that was in the first 75 minutes.I DO recommend this movie. Most of the performances are great and there is some very good dialogue all over the place just look out for the occasional giant heaps of maudlin fodder being crammed down your throat alright alright it made me cry a little so it did its job.".

First their was Kevin Kline who gave an excellent performance as the dying George who wants to heal the relationship between him and his son. The son is amazingly performed by Hayden Christensen. His acting performance was without any doubt the most outstanding performance of the whole movie. His character Sam is introvert extravagant and completely messed up.George's plan for the summer is the built a house a plan he has been postponing his whole life and to do this with his son in order the heal their relationship. This movie has a brilliant cast. Besides Kline and Christensen there's also Kristin Scott Thomas The English Patient Jena Malone Donnie Darko and Mary Steenbergen Philadelphia. Furthermore this movie has a lot of brilliant scenes. For example there's the scene where Sam asks his father how you can become something that you're not. Really amazing scene! Actually the whole movie is a sequence of brilliant scenes. I'm not going to mention them all because that would take too long. The only thing I can add is watch this movie!

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Bresson would be the last filmmaker I would think to adapt any story by Fyodor Dostoyevsky a man who might be the greatest writer of melodrama and melodrama as in gutwrenching emotional stuff with a characters in for example Crime and Punishment having a big screaming or dramatic fit all described in massive amounts of painstaking detail mostly so Dostoyevsky could get paid by the word perhaps. Because Bresson was a filmmaker who was completely uncompromising for what his vision required usually nonprofessionals saying dialog with a passive almost restrained quality with emotion held back until the most necessary if at all moments. Bresson was even on record once saying he didn't like sets or actors for that matter. But with Dostoyevsky's story he crafts another work that is all his own while honoring the harsh view on the human heart that the author had. It's a story where one might be tempted to take the woman's side or arguably that she even did the right thing for herself at the end or as we at the start at the beginning told backwards but it's never that easy.A Gentle Woman leans more to searching for common sense where there is none Elle is a simple girl in a family that doesn't treat her well we don't see this we just hear it secondhand and has a gentle quality or 'meek' as Dostoyevsky's story was originally titled that somehow allures Luc who works as a pawnbroker. He pursues her even though she's not much interested in his advances I told you not to follow me she says to him as he follows her up to his house in a tone soft but firm. He marries her. They seem momentarily at peace but this soon breaks Luc is continually insecure with himself in a sense because he can never feel secure in his relationship. Unlike That Obscure Object of Desire where there was a mindgame involving the sex in the possessive relationship there's no question that they do go to bed. It's the whole factor of what's really there in terms of trust love redemption and above all a connection between two people. A scene that could be in a silent film a form Bresson desperately would love to have tried the couple are watching a film in a theater and she is sitting next to a guy on her other side. Luc can't stand this and almost on instinct he stands so the two can switch. A glance or a couple of glances speak a thousand ideas in a Bresson film.In fact it's Bresson's attempts as in other films to try and intellectualize an emotional downward spiral that gains interest. Because it's the opposite of your usual melodrama where the characters get all excited and angry and yelling and lots of misunderstandings and so on the style is stripped down leading to what is a much more distressing relationship they're in. Neither one can give in but Elle just can't seem to leave him or go through an affair. And Luc likewise can't seem to ever go to lengths of domestic violence or on the flipside leaving him. It's all about him having her not the other way around and the moments that she tries and asks him about his past doings i.e. being fired from a bank teller job he hesitates. There's a mold in shape that he can't seem to break of her and by the time he goes for it and says over and over I love you it's clear as day she's already past that point saying I thought you were going to leave me. Enigmatic maybe it depends on the viewer.It might be understandable this is one of Bresson's least available selections no DVD yet and a very paltry availability on the internet quarters of VHS sales even though it shouldn't be. It's a fascinating experiment in dissecting character through narrative albeit Bresson cuts back and forth between Luc at Elle's dead body at the bed a wee bit much through good narration from him and in revealing little things about the relationship for a modern audience. There's a subtext I liked that dealt with diversions theater television films that are like little respites for the two of them for Elle moreso as we see with her interest in Hamlet. And of course the Catholic dimension of feeling from Dostoyevsky carried over into Bresson is felt more that almost any other of his films divorce it seems is never called into question. This makes it dangerously close to being behindthetimes with its ultimately tragic fate for the characters.But it also puts up an ultimatum of morality not just for Luc but for Elle in hindsight the film doesn't condone suicide for all of the poetic splendor it's revealed in at the start and finish not to mention that amazing final shot of the coffin being nailed in. Many interpretations existential feminist even Marxist to a smaller extent could be taken into account. One thing is for certain A Gentle Woman isn't an easy film to digest but for those willing to give it a shot it offers some intriguing layers beneath the subdued manner. By the way watch for the scene that finally comes up that was taken for the somewhat misleading video cover it's a total 180 aside from the basic initial physical motion of a similar scene in Goodfellas!".

There's a subtext I liked that dealt with diversions theater television films that are like little respites for the two of them for Elle moreso as we see with her interest in Hamlet. And of course the Catholic dimension of feeling from Dostoyevsky carried over into Bresson is felt more that almost any other of his films divorce it seems is never called into question. This makes it dangerously close to being behindthetimes with its ultimately tragic fate for the characters.But it also puts up an ultimatum of morality not just for Luc but for Elle in hindsight the film doesn't condone suicide for all of the poetic splendor it's revealed in at the start and finish not to mention that amazing final shot of the coffin being nailed in. Many interpretations existential feminist even Marxist to a smaller extent could be taken into account. One thing is for certain A Gentle Woman isn't an easy film to digest but for those willing to give it a shot it offers some intriguing layers beneath the subdued manner. By the way watch for the scene that finally comes up that was taken for the somewhat misleading video cover it's a total 180 aside from the basic initial physical motion of a similar scene in Goodfellas!";

	schema:headline " Powerful and haunting";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on a short story by Fyodor Dostoevsky Robert Bresson's A Gentle Woman is the story of Elle Dominique Sanda a beautiful young woman who without any forewarning jumps to her death from the balcony of her Paris apartment. We do not see the actual event only a hand opening a door a table falling over a flower pot breaking and a white scarf floating limply through the air. Her story is told almost matteroffactly by her husband Luc Guy Frangin to his maid Jeanne Lobre as he stands by her bed next to the body but we are no clearer about the why at the end than we were at the beginning.Although the film is Bresson's first in color and perhaps more accessible than many of his films it is also full of his typically enigmatic details and coincidences that may be clues to the fate of the characters. Like most of his films the actors are nonprofessionals with the exception of Ms. Sanda and the performances are emotionally detached yet rich in nuance and body language and the overall experience is powerful and haunting. In flashback we discover that her husband Luc is a pawnbroker and the two meet when she comes to his store to sell a crucifix. The distinction between her spiritual nature and his obsession with material things is apparent when he strips off the plastic statue of Jesus keeping only the gold cross that he deems to be of some value.Moved by her poverty and enamored with her striking features he pays more than the cross is worth but she returns it to him saying that she cannot be bought. Though he pursues her with determination Elle at first resists. You don't want love she tells him. You want me to agree to marry you. Luc insists that he can take her away from her sordid surroundings and provide her with a home saying Say yes and you can leave here forever. And she at last agrees but it is clear from the beginning that the marriage is a mismatch and throughout the film Bresson conveys a growing mood of claustrophobia and growing oppressiveness. Luc appeals to her spiritual nature by taking her to museums operas and plays and buying her phonograph records but there is something missing.On the surface he loves her but he is cold humorless and unable to understand or meet her deepest needs. On the other hand Elle is withdrawn given to long periods of silence and makes little attempt to communicate her feelings. Indeed she may be clinically depressed but Bresson deals with people's problems in existential rather than psychological terms. For myself he has said there is something which makes suicide possible almost inevitable  the feeling of void which is impossible to bear. Perhaps Bresson views suicide at least on one level as an act of spiritual redemption and A Gentle Woman may have that implication though the film is very much open to interpretation.One day Elle picks up a gun and points it at Luc but cannot pull the trigger. Inevitably they fight over money and his jealousy surfaces when he discovers her sitting with a young man in a parked car even though he hears her reject the man's advances. When she becomes ill he is generous in providing treatment and the relationship seems to be moving in the right direction until both fearful of intimacy and afraid of being alone something within her snaps. Mentally confused or perhaps clear for the first time she steps out onto the balcony and finds her way home.".

	schema:headline " A story of a relationship that fails has much more resonance than the standard romantic drama";
	schema:reviewBody "I've had difficulty with Bresson films in the past because I love what he despises  acting. His films seem to rely on Kuleshov effect which is to say that you have to feel the actors' emotions by extrapolating from the events that just happened rather than reading their faces. Some people find this easier than others for myself when I watch Kuleshov's experiment I see only a neutral face when the frame cuts to a neutral face! However the Dostoevsky source for this movie is so rich that it allowed Bresson's style to work for me. Une Femme Douce is a story of a love that fails and feels very realistic. The success is down to the Bressonian style which I usually find antithetical. Normal people as opposed to professional actors are not very facially demonstrative so when I saw the couple in this movie I really felt like I was watching a real couple. The lack of demonstration leads to a sense of ambiguity at key moments. There's a kind of Renoirian multifacetedness which tends to see a person as a congregation of souls pulling in different directions jostling for the rudder rather than as a coherent identity. But there's also ambiguity in the sense that the couple plain just can't read each other at points. There are several examples of uncorrected miscommunication in the film which again feels very authentic in terms of relationships.Some people have great difficulty finding someone to love and share their lives with may only get one attempt at something that could work and often fail. That's a great very human tragedy that you don't get to see very often at the cinema. This story of a young couple the man a pawnbroker Luc the woman simply known as elle is a story of two people who don't fit in modern life. She is fey inquisitive at home with the natural distrustful of people and entirely at odds with the systems of living that define human progress. Luc is the opposite a creature of the system he makes money from debt has fixed expectations about relationships and lacks spontaneity. She suffers from weltschmerz a pain of the sensitive that arises from an understanding or feeling of how life could or should be in comparison to the dismal and feeble structures that we have. They try to inhabit the centre ground together but the compromise doesn't hold.I like that the film acknowledges that even the most significant moments in a person's life can be fairly banal a fleeting disengaged conversation on a bench at the zoo in this film.Although I chose to see the film as a rather blameless story you could view elle as the victim of Luc who compares himself to Mephistopheles at one point. The film is feminist under that sense although I think in a very patronising way. For example at various points in the movie the TV in their apartment shows spectacles which are very maleoriented such as motor car racing. There's a sense that culture is about the male that authentic female culture is something rare and unpreserved. I don't think that elle's condition is unique to women it actually reminds me RD Laing on schizophrenia The experience and behaviour that gets labelled schizophrenic is a special strategy that a person invents in order to live in an unlivable situation. It's worth pointing out that the film is substantially aided by the talents of Ghislain Cloquet one of the great cinematographers who certainly was shooting only top drawer material in this film.It is a matter of irony to me that although Bresson chose nonprofessionals as usual for this film Dominique Sanda elle later went on to win Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival seven years later. The role demanded someone beautiful so Bresson picked her up from her job as a model for Vogue. Guy Frangin Luc on the other hand has this film as his only credited role.".

	schema:headline " A Sentimental Favorite";
	schema:reviewBody "THE WIZARD is a sentimental favorite for anyone who raced home after school to turn on their gray and black Nintendo Entertainment Systems. For this set born in the late '70s and early '80s the excitement in the air was palpable when previews for the film appeared on TV. It not only combined our two favorite entertainment vehicles  Nintendo and movies  but also provided a thrilling sneak preview of the year's most anticipated game Super Mario Bros. 3. NES geeks of course they weren't geeks back then... Nintendo was cool thought they'd died and gone to eightbit heaven.When we finally got mom and dad to take us to the theater or pick up the video THE WIZARD was every bit as good as we'd hoped. Critics almost universally panned it as a 90minute Nintendo commercial but young viewers were enthralled. Besides... a 90minute Nintendo commercial wasn't exactly an awful thing!. The film combined very human storytelling with hardy laughs and wideeyed exhilaration. It gave us playground catchphrases Lucas with I love the Power Glove. It's so bad and Jimmy with Callifornya... Callifornya! Sure the highlight was all the cool video gamerelated stuff but video games were a big part of our lives one that our parents just didn't understand. The people who made this movie whatever their intentions did.Most eight or nine or tenyearolds who caught THE WIZARD upon release would give it two big thumbs up if not the Oscar for Best Picture of AllTime. Of course we're not eight or nine or ten anymore and THE WIZARD in hindsight is not actually a cinematic masterpiece. But nor is it the sort of mindless junk that stuffy critics would have us believe. The film is actually a sweet harmless crosscountry adventure. It has laughs who could forget Haley's scream of He touched my breast! to ward off the hapless Putnam? and emotion Jimmy's reflections of his late sister are undeniably heartbreaking. And the video game competition finale holds up surprisingly well even with the novelty of the Super Mario Bros. 3 footage long worn off.Beyond that THE WIZARD carries deeper meanings that children can pick up on. Jimmy the autistic video game prodigy demonstrates that all of us regardless of our limitations possess marvelous gifts. Putnam the coldhearted family services worker trying to take Jimmy away helps illustrate that families are what matter. And the villainous Lucas is an example of how we should treat our enemies with dignity and by letting our actions speak louder than our words as Jimmy does. Okay it's not exactly Nietzsche but it's not total fluff either.THE WIZARD is not the greatest movie of alltime. It's probably not even a great movie. But it is a special period piece a reminder of a simpler time when our only worry in the world was passing math and knocking off goombas. It will forever hold a special place in the hearts of many.".

	schema:reviewBody "Somewhere along the line someone realized that it's nigh impossible to  make a good movie based on a video game. So instead they made a movie  about the entire Nintendo Entertainment System thereby capturing all the  feelgood nostalgia associated with its hundreds of titles but without crippling handicaps such as an unfeasible plot or JeanClaude VanDamme as Colonel William F. Guile. Thus was born The Wizard...a shameless consumerist repackaging of The Who's Tommy adjusted for a new audience and coming at you in fullon buddy film fashion.  Fred Savage explodes onto the screen as a curlyhaired dork with highly articulate eyebrows. He's caught between his divorced parents in a  custody battle over his autistic obsessivecompulsive equinophobic dyslexic colorblind kid brother Jimmy. Realizing that being in the custody of one or more of his parents will most certainly kill Jimmy and that Jimmy has the superhuman ability to reach level 3 on Double Dragon  Fred Savage does the right thing and whisks his kid brother off to  exploit his virtuosic video game playing ability for cash and prizes  worth well over 130.  Along the way they meet Haley who's totally hot if you're 12. Haley  misleads Fred and Jimmy on many occasions notably one scene where  renegade truckers steal their entire video game pilgrimage budget and  presumably molest them. Still they stick to their guns or should I say their Nintendo LIGHT GUNS for use with Duck Hunt even managing to outsmart the enigmatic Lucas a rebellious young boy who apparently lives alone in the desert like Mohammed. Only this messiah has a Nintendo POWER GLOVE buy yours today!  Lucas complicates the story creating a sordid love triangle between  himself Fred Savage and Haley. He taunts Jimmy ruthlessly We  wouldn't want you to...WHIZ on yourself. and despite having devoted his life to Nintendo games and thus presumably having no friends a crowd of  prepubescent disciples follow him at all times. His secret to success is the Nintendo Power Glove which is in Lucas's own words so bad. But as most of us know the truth is that the Nintendo Power Glove was totally gay. It only did what you wanted it to do when you were punching your friend in the face with it to vent your frustration about its lack of response.  The protagonists' path is beset by peril on all sides. There are  teenage white trash hoodlums who exist solely for the purpose of  stealing Jimmy's hat and saying lines like What is this kid some sort of cyborg? There are fat salesmen who talk like Foghorn Leghorn unable to believe that a scrawny kid is better than they are at Contra.  And don't get me started on the creepy bald guy hired by Fred's mom to  bring the kids back home dead or alive. His name is Putnam and repeatedly  touches Haley's breasts. Meanwhile Beau Bridges plays Nintendo like my  dad yanking the controller this way and that. Every time Beau Bridges  and Christian Slater run into Putnam a redneck banjo riff kicks in and  the whole movie starts to sound like a Menard's commercial while the adversaries engage in automobile gardening tool combat.  Saved from certain molestation by a grotesque manchild named Spanky  their adventure climaxes when they play Ninja Gaiden with a scary  gravelvoiced MC who also seems to be a child molester and nearly get eaten by a fake King Kong at UNIVERSAL STUDIOS THEMEPARK now open! By the way Jimmy knows the exact location of the Warp Whistle in Super Mario Bros. 3 prior to the game's release because he reads Nintendo Power Magazine. Jimmy gets the warp whistle and uses it to reach World 4 yes Giant World and Lucas looks on helplessly as his empire of Power Gloves comes crashing down around him.  Spackled with golden dialogue this movie is a subculture in its own  right. But while many people quote Lucas's it's so bad or Haley's  he touched my breast for me it doesn't get any better than when Christian Slater says  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Wizard is one of the best 80s movies for kids or teens. It's got it allan excellent and hilarious story great music excellent actors and above allthat little 80s console of long hours of entertainment known as The Nintendo. The Wizard was made to feul sales for Nintendo in promoting it's newest video game Super Mario Brothers 3 which I understand to be the company's best selling game of all time and with good reason. The story involves three kids struggling for independence from their messed up family life. Fred Savage plays Cory who's father and brother tend to change the subject of the uncomfortable fact that his halfbrother Jimmy is going to be put in a foster home. Not if Cory can help it. He and Jimmy go Shanghai for California the land of possibility. Along the way they meet Haley a hot shot young girl who's father is a truck driver and mother is a gambling addict. On her way to Reno she discovers that Jimmy is a video game wizard like the Pinball Wizard. With the Video Game Armaggeddon just weeks away Haley comes up with the idea that the three kids should pool their resources go to California compete and split the cash.It may seem like an easy goalheading from Utah to California on a skateboard and a couple of bucks hustling video game hacks along the way. But meanwhile a crazy bounty hunter kind of guy has been hired to bring Jimmy and only Jimmy back home. He's similarly in a competitionagainst Corey's father who needs to get to the kids first before the crazy bounty hunter does. This movie has it all. You get to see some the greatest Nintendo games Double Dragon Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles The Adventures of Zelda Excite Bike and Rad Racer in addition to other Nintendo accessories such as The Power Glove I love the Power Glove it's so bad. It's so effective in selling Nintendo nostalgia though it wasn't quite nostalgia when the movie was made that it will make you want to pull out the old consoleor emulatorand have a crack or two at some games again.Additionally you have an excellent cast of actors involved in a hilarious catandmouse chase with the most laughs coming from the traveling dispute of the bounty hunter and Corey's dad Beau Bridges. Plus how can you go wrong with an early Fred Savage Jennifer Rilo Kiley Lewis and Christian Slater movie? You can't. It's packed to the brim with excellent features that if you're in love with the 80s you're sure to enjoy.".

It's packed to the brim with excellent features that if you're in love with the 80s you're sure to enjoy.";

	schema:reviewBody "It's Tommy but in non musical sense. The story follows a little boy who like Tommy is non associative to sound or picture and can beat the toughest arcade games of his day without batting an eyelash.Depression brought on by the tragic loss of his twin sister Jennifer and his family's refusal to discuss the situation leads sevenyearold Jimmy Woods to hide deeper and deeper inside himself. Searching for answers he concludes that if he can only return to the place on Earth where he was happiest where the best time in his life occurred he will be able to truly be happy again. Lunch pail in hand and nothing but his own intuition to guide him the young boy sets off on a trip to California. We can only imagine the horrors that have filled Jimmy's life with his preadolescent confusion and disunderstanding of the reality of things around him. His wanting to just hear the words that it's all right. Jimmy is fascinated with patterns and observing the narrowing toward the peak of a pyramid watching a pattern shorten in essence move faster. Similar in an analog sense to the ascending difficulty in repeating patterns of the motions of video game characters on a television screen.Corey Woods Jimmy's older half brother through their father loves his brother. He wants no harm or fear to ever enter Jimmy's life and wants only for his sibling to live happily in the company of family and friends. Corey coincidentally decides to run away to California with Jimmy to keep him out of a home for the mentally disabled.Haley is the know it all all grown up kid who tries her damnedest to hold the world together. Wants to prove to her father that she's got it together. Her mother who got lost in an addiction to gambling and unspecified drugs left her father. Haley wants to prove to herself as much as to her father that she's got it together. So much so that she can travel cross country alone at twelve so much so that she can gamble against nothing and come out on the very top.Sam Woods fills in most of the comic relief as he and his eldest son Nick spend the movie in a race and chase against the children's bounty hunter a snyde assbag of a fellow real easy character to hate called Putnam. Putnam was hired by Sam's exwife and Jimmy's mother Christine and her new husband Mr. Bateman to track down the runaway children. He sees Jimmy and Corey as a meal ticket and he refuses to let anything get between him and his money. He has several encounters with Sam and Nick on his hunt and tries to stop them every step of the way with as many underhanded schemes as he can come up with from slashing Sam's tires to selling Sam's truck to a chopshop. He is representation of all seven mortal sins and while Sam is nowhere near a perfect person it is easy to cheer him on every time he gets a step ahead of or attacks Mister Putnam. Through the film Sam and Nick get to play several video games and come to a sort of understanding of one another that they hadn't had since Jennifer was alive a sort of comradery that ought to exist between every son and father but is so rare.Lucas is the reigning video game champion and has a thug crew who hang onto him because he is as close as they will ever get to anything worthwhile as Lucas hangs onto the video games in the same manner. Lucas is not necessarily an evil character and at the end there is a sense of humbling within him as he does come to realize slightly that winning isn't everything and losing won't kill you.Along their journey the kids are helped by various people in parts of society that most would try to shy away from truckers and gamblers and lesbian bikers to be specific. The story also shows that even if you think you know who you are getting a ride from you should beware because greed can make even the seemingly nicest person into a monster.The story is simple yet worthwhile three kids go across the country to do something that they had never thought to do before it recommends that real adventure should coexist with electronic diversion if you're going to have electronic diversion and it also shows us that there is a time and a place for everything. It shows kids that if they are ever in trouble with a stranger it is always a good idea to scream. In the end Jimmy is more social but still has a long way to go before anyone might consider him normal but it shows definite progress in his character.Even though the situation is ridiculous in parts it is still touching and fun. This is a great family film which can make the family video game machine be more than just a toy.I highly recommend it regardless of your age or family status.".

Not by any means. The story is compelling the acting particularly the traumatized boy is above par the drama is wellexecuted and not overdone lending to some very humorous and intentional moments and the message is timeless. In fact the climax with just a little suspension of disbelief will have you eagerly awaiting the outcome whilst all the while rooting for the film's hero to emerge just that.Don't go in with the highest expectations but surely don't go in expecting a bad 90minute commercial.".

My favorite character was Haley because she represented what I would like to be tough smart and sophisticated. My favorite part is of course the video game competition. The way they treated it in the movie was like it was the Academy Awards! I know I'll never be that good at video games.

My only question is if that video games is seemingly Jimmy's only talent then what is he going to do when he grows up? You can't exactly be a professional video game player! Oh well it's still a perfect 10 in my eyes!";

Nelson was run over by a train but Roy's mother Evangeline Chutney with who Roy has a somewhat emotionally distant relationship believes he committed suicide. The second is that because funding to the school has reduced the football program to just a varsity team with no junior varsity Roy along with half the other players is cut from the football squad as his coach doesn't believe he is mentally tough enough despite he being a skilled player. The two incidents combined make the situation even worse for Roy as football was his primary connection to his father.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie has recently been playing on Showtime in my area and I was interested in watching it because I am a fan of both Ryan Gosling and David Morse. I first became a Ryan Gosling fan after seeing him in The Notebook. I have to say his performance in this film did not disappoint. David Morse's performance was one of his best. After reading all the comments and replies here I just wanted to add some of my thoughts about the film and what I felt the filmmakers were going for.First of all I am not a fan of movies that are neatly bundled into a happy ending by the end of the film. I like those films that portray life as it really is and that make you THINK. The most memorable aspect of this film indeed the most heartbreaking is Gid's torment and loneliness in life. I don't think he was gay just a lost soul looking for acceptance friendship indeed reciprocal love if you will and a sense of purpose in life. Roy's character seemed to be looking for most of the same things. He had a father who wasn't there for him in life and a mother so bitter over the divorce that she was too busy trying to find love of her own to take the time to nurture her own son.I found the comments regarding the relationship between Gid and Studebaker very interesting re were they homosexuals? Just because two men form a friendship in life doesn't mean they are gay. To me Studebaker's jealousy over Gid's interest in Roy is just a natural human emotion. Haven't you at times been jealous when a friend of the same sex showed interest in someone new? Does that make you gay? Also it doesn't seem there was anyone else in the town who gave a damn about him Studebaker so any threat to that bond frightened him. Their friendship was most likely just that of two lost souls trying to get by in life. It made me think so much more of Gid that he did not pass judgement on Studebaker  he cared enough about his well being to try to stop his drinking to give him his insulin injections to try to get a room for him at the shelter on that last bitterly cold night.The scene in which Gid is hugging Roy and won't let go was very powerful. Roy who had been told by others that Gid was gay must have had that thought foremost in his mind and misinterpreted Gid's demonstration of affection. Perhaps Gid remembering that Roy had just lost his father wanted to show him that he is not alone that there are people in the world who really care. Perhaps Roy reminded Gid of the boy who drowned and he was transferring his feelings of guilt over that tragedy into that embrace. For whatever the reason Roy's embarrassment which quickly progressed to rage that Gid might be demonstrating some sort of homosexual intent are a damning indictment of our society. Homophobia at it's worse.The scene in the hospital at the end of the movie when Gid takes Roy's hand and places it on his forehead was very moving. Roy did not pull his hand away instead in this simple gentle gesture the filmmakers were showing us that Roy had overcome his fear of demonstrating affection toward another as well as overcoming any homophobic thoughts he might have had about Gid.The acting was first rate all around. Compelling story line. Beautiful Montana scenery. Sound quality not the best but I would definitely recommend this film to others.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Slaughter Rule is one of the few unique films that captivates the viewer straight from the opening sequence.  The film opens with a haunting shot as twin brothers Alex and Andrew Smith take there camera through a barbwire fence to reveal a helpless dying deer literally struggling for its every last breath of life.  Enter Roy Chutney a high school student who is cut from the varsity football team just three days prior to losing his estranged father.  Much like the deer Roy never gives up in his struggle to live his life in wake of tragedy even after losing just about everything that held meaning in his young adulthood.  Roy is eventually approached by the local paper distributor Gideon played with remarkable passion and sustain by the brilliant David Morse.  Gideon asks Roy to join his roughneck 6man football team.  Upon joining Roy is taken under Gideon's wing and must eventually confront the smalltown rumors that linger regarding Gideons sexuality and turbulent past.  The Slaughter Rule is unlike any high school football movie ever made.  First of all the film omits any of the standard hallway and classroom scenes that frequent every other film of the genre It also discards the glorified high school football stadiums that almost give the impression they could be home to the next super bowl.  Instead the scenes in this film are mainly set in country  bars private bedrooms and cold icy fields where the viewer can almost feel themselves being slammed into the frozen tundra alongside the players themselves.  Where most football movies feature strong goodlooking prom king type players The Slaughter Rule uses gritty normallooking kids that could easily be seen tossing the pigskin around in any small middle American town.  Eric Edwards stunning cinematography and altcountry musician Jay Farrar's folk influenced score help make The Slaughter Rule one of the most promising directorial debuts in recent years and was by far the best film I saw at the 2002 Lake Placid Film Festival.  I strongly urge anyone who has ever experienced loss from death or rejection to watch this film.  For those of you who have not pull that letterman jacket out of the closet and rent Varsity Blues.Jesse Haven is a 19 year old film student from Burlington Vermont Questions or comments??

Roy is eventually approached by the local paper distributor Gideon played with remarkable passion and sustain by the brilliant David Morse.  Gideon asks Roy to join his roughneck 6man football team.  Upon joining Roy is taken under Gideon's wing and must eventually confront the smalltown rumors that linger regarding Gideons sexuality and turbulent past.  The Slaughter Rule is unlike any high school football movie ever made.  First of all the film omits any of the standard hallway and classroom scenes that frequent every other film of the genre It also discards the glorified high school football stadiums that almost give the impression they could be home to the next super bowl.  Instead the scenes in this film are mainly set in country  bars private bedrooms and cold icy fields where the viewer can almost feel themselves being slammed into the frozen tundra alongside the players themselves.  Where most football movies feature strong goodlooking prom king type players The Slaughter Rule uses gritty normallooking kids that could easily be seen tossing the pigskin around in any small middle American town.  Eric Edwards stunning cinematography and altcountry musician Jay Farrar's folk influenced score help make The Slaughter Rule one of the most promising directorial debuts in recent years and was by far the best film I saw at the 2002 Lake Placid Film Festival.  I strongly urge anyone who has ever experienced loss from death or rejection to watch this film.  For those of you who have not pull that letterman jacket out of the closet and rent Varsity Blues.Jesse Haven is a 19 year old film student from Burlington Vermont Questions or comments??  Email me";

Ryan Gosling is deep and effective as a teenage jock who's life has seen it's rocky roads and then he meets a quiet mystifying older man who wants to recruit him for a six man football team. What Gosling doesn't know is about the Man's past which turns out to test their growing relationship. It's an often slow but alluring tale absorbing you in to the story of characters that are both familiar and alien and ending up with an odd but truthful ending that pulls out all the raw closeted emotions that the two men have for each other and it's homemoviestyle video shoot and beautiful country scenery brings it to life.".

Recently for example there has been a spate of maleoriented psychosexual dramas that go deeply into themes usually represented in mainstream cinema as subconscious or accidental phenomena.In The Slaughter Rule as well as other recent offerings like L.I.E. or Priest or Taboo originally Gohatto characters reveal emotions that seem designed specifically to break new ground in the amorphic area between ordinary storytelling and what some would call pornography.  The common word to describe this is disturbing.  But just as Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf Midnight Cowboy and Harold and Maude opened people's eyes in the 60's and 70's to the possibilities of disturbing cinema as literature these new films may lead in my view to an entirely new public attitude about the inherent validity of the effort.To be sure The Slaughter Rule is a flawed film.  So are many others of its kind to date.  Its premise however is sound.  One can nitpick about cinematic values geographical anomalies or plot distractions etc. but to be able to see disparate fictional characters get under each other's skin is what makes any drama come to life.  Added to that in this case is a very competent job of producing directing and editing.  Moreover no one can quarrel with the acting performance of David Morse.Coming to grips with overtly sexual themes in films  particularly those that deal seriously with disturbing but very real kinds of human emotions  is a challenging task not only for moviemakers like the Smiths but also for viewers.  I give this movie an E for effort and a solid 9 out of 10 for everything else.".

So I was intrigued when I saw it was on Sundance Channel as it hadn't appeared on screens in New York. The debut jointly writtendirected feature of twin brothers Andrew and Alex Smith the film has a lot of similarity to Tom Cruise's early All the Right Moves even down to charismatic young star Ryan Gosling clearly being a movie star hunk of the future.  Set in the brothers' home area of rugged and very desolate Montana in the fall this film takes its working class football frame of athlete seeking father figure and coach conflict much further in examining maleness and the implications of the homoeroticism of such sports much further. It bravely particularly by David Morse in a touchingly agonized performance goes into the breach of what much discussion of current scandals has avoided at the confused nexus of pedophilia and sexual identity particularly for teenage boys.  There's also a dollop of racial issues via the very realistically portrayed poverty of the Native Americans.  The women are mostly helpless within this overwhelmingly male environment and their best choice for survival is just to leave as unromantically satisfying as that is.This ranks in the gritty tradition of sports movies as a setting to demonstrate social tensions like Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner than more popular fare.".

But it is I think a good movie and a very powerful and thoughtprovoking one.  My initial reaction which I passed onto Smith was that I was moved by the internal conflict in this unusual comingofage story.  What kind of man is Gosling going to become?  How will he deal not just with the peer pressures and love interests but with societal prejudices and the essence of humanity compassion and kindness. Interestingly I learned that an early tagline considered for the film was something like What makes a man?David Morse's performance is absolutely incredible in this movie.  I spoke to a film critic about it and he said he thought Morse was the best American actor that no one has heard of.  It is an extremely challenging and enigmatic role that he plays with a poignant compelling and believable complexity.  I was at the same time deeply moved repulsed angered and sympathetic.  I was reminded that there is good and bad in all of us and that the demons within are part of the essence of humanity.Maybe too deep and philosophical for a movie about 8man football.  And that's just itit's a situational contrast that's unexpected and jarring. If you ever get a chance to see this film grab it.".

His father with whom he had only the most casual of relationships has been discovered dead on a railroad track a possible suicide victim. His mother embittered by their divorce sleeps around with countless men and has no real inclination to provide her son with any but the most cursory form of maternal affection. On top of all this Roy has just been rejected for the school's varsity football team because the coach finds him lacking in the kind of 'anger' he feels a player needs to be a success on the gridiron. When Roy is asked by Gid a somewhat eccentric older man in the town to come join his sixman football team the youth only reluctantly acquiesces sixman football is a near ruleless poor relation to the real game one ostensibly only played by farm boys. It is at this point that Roy's growth into manhood begins since it turns out that the enigmatic Gid who one assumes will be merely a father figure for the affectionstarved youth may be seeking more than just a fatherson athletecoach relationship with the boy.This latenthomosexual subtext in fact is just about the only element that separates 'The Slaughter Rule' from countless other films in this genre. Most everything else about the film feels derivative and stale the emotionally distant parents the promiscuous psychologically detached mother the abusive stepdad the sweet girl who wants to flee this hicksville town as fast and as far as a bus ticket can take her. Towards the end especially the filmmakers start to pile up the heartbreaks and tragedies one on top of the other almost to epic proportions. One wonders how so much can happen in so short a time to so small a group of people. In the almost two hour running time of the film only the ambiguity of the RoyGid relationship arouses any real interest in the viewer.Ryan Gosling is tremendously appealing as the troubled Roy and David Morse the father in 'Contact' turns Gid into a nicely sympathetic figure. The starkness of the Montana landscape also provides an appropriate backdrop for the bleak melodrama that is playing itself out in the foreground.

My high school Great Falls High was the school used in the beginning of the film and the locker room the team is in happens to be the girl's locker room. David Morse's character lives above a vacuum place downtown. The hospital in the movie used to actually be the old Colombus hospital but is now a office building.The twins in the movie Matt and Paul Pippinich I went to school with for 7 years and that old orange truck is theirs.

In some ways this is true but the city is not as run down and rural as it appears in the movie.Overall I found myself enjoying this movie more for the hey I know him! or I lived 2 miles from there situations. While this wasn't a movie that I would want to watch repeatedly I still highly suggest it for rental. It's more than just a sports movie.Also a stellar soundtrack that makes the movie that much better.".

These movie's flaws prevented me from enjoying it much.First two key deleted scenes from the start of the film leave the entire premise feeling hollow. The scenes are offered as a special feature on the DVD. If I were to watch this movie again I'd play these two deleted scenes where they should have been. First the scene deleted after the conversation about the teen's father that opens the movie. Second just minutes later the continuation of a scene talking with the coach in his office.This has been a growing trend for directors to cut key scenes that explain things at the start of the movie. In at least commentary tracks directors have said they 'just wanted to get on with the movie'. Well of course they might since they know the story intimately. The viewer won't and could use the background to make an emotional connection to the movie. Unless the movie is past the two hour mark why consider cutting valuable scenes?Gosling and some of the other performances were great. Of course Gosling does great even in rotten movies like Murder By Numbers.The wide screen was an overly wide aspect I guess meant to highlight those beautiful outdoor scenes over the actors. It leaves barely enough room for actors' heads in places and it made the brief shower scene no fun at all. To echo another comment the sound was very poor in places. More than accents it was bad mixing where sound jumped from soft whisphers to loud music then back. My finger ended up fiddling with the volume throughout.In hindsight I might watch The Slaughter Rule once but it won't be worth watching even a second time.".

It took a good fifteen minutes of footage before there was an edit or a line of dialogue that made any sense and it took another 30 minutes before the hamfisted script gave way to a working plot that wasn't contingent on a closeup of Ryan Gosling's smile or contrived moralizing. After the first 45 minutes however the script blossomed into a watchable albeit not completely entertaining or thoughtprovoking.  The highlights certainly include both Gosling and Morse's acting Gosling being an upandcoming star and Morse being an extremely wellestablished character actor with a good feel for disparate emotions.  As a sidenote after the screening I was talking a little smack about the movie to some of my friends when David Morse walked right behind meHe looks like the nicest guy in the world but he's a solid 6'2 and probably outweighs me by 50 pounds.

	schema:reviewBody "Slaughter Rule is a firsttime Sundance film by the twins Andrew and Alex Smith that stars Ryan Gosling and David Morse with an excellent cast featuring Kelly Lynch Clea Duvall Eddie Spears and David Cale. Photography in unusual twostrip widescreen format Cinemascope is by Eric Edwards who shot My Own Private Idaho and some of the Montana landscapes have that same poetry but this time the focus is on a deadend town heading into winter.  Roy Courtney Ryan Gosling a high school football player gets one bad piece of news after another.  His estranged father has been run over by a train and killed perhaps a suicide.  Right after the funeral he gets cut from the team.   Then he meets a seedy roving sixman football coach named Gideon David Morse who sells late edition newspapers sings in a bar and looks out for the diabetic town drunk Studebaker who seems to be more than just a pal.  When they meet in a bar Gideon who mysteriously knows all about him insists that Roy is his next star quarterback.Gid's hard sell and excessive charm already make us suspicious.  The trouble is and that's just one more of a string of downbeat events to come that rumor has it Gid likes boys and that one of them died with him when he was elsewhere in the state.  It's a tough tradeoff to accept this guy as your coach just to play the game but Roy is desperate to play football and to have an adult male mentor in his life.It feels like this could have been a powerful movie  it does have some powerful scenes.  Both Gosling and Morse turn in complex and interesting performances that enliven their strained relationship but there is little to admire in the screenplay which meanders too much and is too downbeat. Clea Duvall has moments but only that as Roy's older girlfriend a bartender.  Eddie Spears as Tracey Roy's Indian best buddy and fellow football player has good looks and charm to burn but aside from glimpses of a lousy family and abusive father he has little background and not much of a developmental role to play in Roy's life.The central scene is a tussle in Gid's rundown room when he gets Roy in a bear hug and can't let go. This is where his uneasy repressed sexuality comes out and Roy's horror of it is stimulated.  David Morse bites down hard on his juicy role and Gosling who later was to show his electric energy and boldness in both The Believer and Murder by Numbers is mercurial and kaleidoscopic in his range of emotions throughout the movie from hard and aggressive to soft and vulnerable.  If only Gosling didn't have that reedy Mickey Mouse Club look and spiky hair he would have all the material to be a major star. He is a major acting talent.  He's a risk taker with great presence and it's a crime that there isn't even a US video or DVD of The Believer out yet.One trouble with the direction of Slaughter Rule is that partly in an effort at authenticity dialogue is often throwaway.  There are lost lines in every scene and after a while you get used to not really following completely.The situation generated by Gideon is uncomfortable and the movie never resolves our discomfort it just worries with it and carries it from scene to scene.The team does well at first but things look worse and worse as the weather gets colder and the coach seems odder and odder.  Roy clings to him out of the desperation of need for want of anything better.  He clings to his girlfriend but she rejects him when he seems too immature to her and shows that he doesn't connect sex with intimacy.  Before long she leaves town on a bus and Roy just manages to say goodbye.  It's another good moment for Gosling but the relationship hasn't been rounded out and is just dropped.Football games have been done to death with all kinds of slickness and usually they end with the traditional agonizingly obvious achingly suspenseful last minute win for our hero's team.  That kind of clich is avoided here but while many football movies are too slick here the game sequences are sloppily edited and too halfhearted and anticlimactic to engage real interest.  Does this movie have to be so persistently downbeat?  Roy's initial misfortunes are only the beginning. His relationship with Gid is clearly doomed.  He only gets a girlfriend in order to lose her.  Studebaker Gid's sad pal dies in a car.  Then in the final game Roy's best mate Tracy gets his neck broken.  This game initiates a desperate drawn out finale. Gid invokes a metaphorical slaughter rule a rule of sixman football that if one team gets far head the other resigns to avoid needless bloodshed.  His point is that they're worn down and that without Tracy they haven't a chance.  A strong man knows when to walk away. But Roy yells and screams to egg the team back into the game calling Gid a wimp and finally a queer. He drives off in his truck without giving Gid his usual ride and Gid wanders off into the tundra as if to die.  But Roy goes back and rescues him we see him and Tracy in the hospital and Roy walks off into the sunset seemingly happy. It's all very unsatisfying  a string of anticlimaxes without focus without the sense of an ending.For all the unhappy events and soul searching that occur nothing is ever resolved.  What makes the screenplay weak aside from its meandering pace is that secondary characters like Studebaker and Roy's mom aren't at all developed.  Another curiously missing element is school.  Roy is a high school student yet we never once see him go near a school or pick up a book.  This is where you miss a good writer about teenagers like the Eighties' S.E. Hinton who would have made the boy's social and daytime existence classmates and friends come vividly to life. Instead of doing what high schoolers actually do Roy spends all his time at bars or practice a pretty odd combination especially since at his father's funeral he refused a drink because he was in training. Sixman football seems to be all consuming especially when your coach has sexual problems but not demanding enough to require avoiding hangovers.Gosling is impressive but the movie lacks the focus for his talents that The Believer provides.  An experienced charismatic supporting player David Morse gives his all in his lead role as Gideon but without a sharply defined plot his confused character flounders and seems overwrought".

It stars a rather young Ryan Gosling and Amy Adams in an American football themed story which is usually the sort of thing I turn my nose at... but as long as the film concentrates on the people rather than the intricacies of the sport I don't really care.The most notable achievement here is in writing the coach as a believable ambiguously gay man which is no mean feat... check out the film My Brother The Devil for an example of this trope done wrong. His friendship with Goslings young hotshot who is a bit unsure about his sexuality himself is well done and there are other minor triumphs of personality based conflicts throughout. A very modest work but one which is worth your time... 610".

By far David Morse GREATEST performance ever as well as quite possibly one of Ryan Goslings best as well. Both leave any actor watching with the utmost inspiration for developing ones own craft. Definitely performances to aspire to in any actors career. If this film is a testament to the Smith Brothers ability to direct actors it certainly leaves no reservations in my mind!

No character makes decisions. No control of any kind is given to anyone. All the characters tumble towards a bleakness not of their doing.That makes for pretty weak drama no matter how earnest the actors. That's because you lose all the drama. The story has nothing to do with what happens. The characters are mere snowflakes in a blizzard. They merely indicate rather than drive an actor's nightmare.This is further limited here by the unrisky approach. It is as if cruel fate came in portion controlled packages. An example is the clumsy love scene perfectly unclumsy in its staging partly to allow engineered modesty and partly to facilitate borrowed camera angles.The actors themselves cannot risk because the filmmakers never define the area of risk. So each actor has to make up his or her own movie. Clea Duvall has the plum role here and she comes close to hitting home.

This is one of his darker films if not his darkest on par with Il Camorrista.As sound as the first fade in of this film appeared I was hooked. I will not spoil anything but you'll see some pretty powerful stuff. The story is complicated and important so giving examples might spoil something so I focus on the experience of this film itself.I have never seen most of the actors in this except Placido but they all did an amazing job. Kseniya Rappoport is so great in this film that it's just haunting. Her performance is a winner without doubt but the supportive cast never seems shy to make their emotions as real as they can.The shots that this film uses are great. All Tornatore films are beautiful but this one is a real dark gem. As him and few other can do he makes the world real.The script is strong. I cannot just define it as a drama because that is a vague term. It's also a disturbing film with a warm touch a heartbreaking plot that twists in a good way.Ennio Morricone wrote the score. I am a great fan of him and I must say that even now being 77 he is still the top composer in the entire industry. With his score for La Sconosciuta he surprised me. Again. This man is so amazing that I curse the Academy awards every day for ignoring him for more than 40 years.So is there nothing bad about La Sconosciuta? Yes there is the DVD is only available in Italy. I bought one with English subtitles so I have little problem watching it but this can be quite a damper on it's international fame. I hope this one gets a great international release both in cinema and on DVD. Great pieces of art should not be kept indoors.I give it 10 out of 10. The best of 2006 and perfect in every way.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly Solid Italian Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "The Ukranian Irena Xenia Rappoport arrives in the city of Velarchi  rents an expensive but simple apartment and seeks a job as a servant in  the building in the other side of the street. Then she manages to work  for the wealthy couple of gold dealers Adacher and occasionally  babysitting their little daughter Tea Clara Dossena who has a rare  neurological disease that leaves the little girl without selfdefense  against any sort of aggression or accident. While working for the  family she is haunted by recollections from her mysterious past of  prostitution and violence in Ukrania. However her nightmares come true  when she meets her former pimp that she believed had died.  La Sconosciuta is a surprisingly solid and original Italian thriller  with an engaging dramatic story disclosed like a puzzle through a  nonlinear screenplay. I saw this movie on DVD with a group of friends  with low expectation and we found it so good that we never dare to stop  the film to make any comment or drink water or go to a toilet so  absorbed we were with the story. The direction of Giuseppe Tornatore  from Cinema Paradiso is outstanding with topnotch performances of  Xenia Rappoport Clara Dossena and the cast. The resolution of the plot  is excellent and never corny. My vote is eight.  Title Brazil A Desconhecida The Unknown".

I enjoy watching muscle cars hurdle through a race track I could watch Die hard 2 any day of the week and I never had the urge to watch Desperate housewivesSex and the city or anything else that might give me an insight to the opposite gender assuming those shows do that. I am not writing this as an apology on behalf of my gender but because the female psyche is a realm that I have yet to fathom and this film not only exposes the abyss of the women's trade atrocities but also to the uncharted territory of one woman's quest for happiness. That particular woman is Irena Xenia Rappoport her performance is beyond describable Irena is an Italian speaking Russiandescent woman in her 30's that starts to work as a maid in an affluent house of well to do parents and their little girl. At first her curiosity for her employers' belongings and since they are in the Diamond business belongings they have in abundance leaves the viewer to assume that Irena is a skilled thief that believes in the broader definition of the term Cleaning. Clearly the truth is much more complicated.It is also clear that the past of Irena is riddled with humiliation violence and degradation committed on her by well the lesser people of my specimen but most of all she is haunted not only by what she had to endure but by what she had and lost and more importantly what she never got the chance to have. I am deliberately enigmatic because the film is too. The peeling of Irena's past is is gradual and seemingly sporadic and her past is gut wrenching and scarring. While the viewers are getting clearer glimpses of that past Irena knowing that the skeletons in her closet are vivid and always present forms a bond with her employers' daughter a young and fragile kid that Irena seems determined far too determined to a stranger's eye to instill the streettoughness that Irena had to acquire in ways that are anything but pleasant.The fictitious story of Irena which is all too real to too many women could have been a display of sensationalist voyeurism a self righteous lecture of the trivial and obvious and let's face it I didn't need to see the film to find the notion of women trading despicable or a mere excuse to show a morbid film under a politically correct subject. This film doesn't have a shred of the above characteristics. The director enhances the horror atmosphere by the chilling musical score the absolutely flawless acting and script and primarily by exposing a woman's quest for happiness amidst the live that leaves very little chance of attaining it. I am usually highly reluctant to discover major plot advancement in movies even movies I don't recommend to watch but this film excavates the problem because the deciphering the enigmatic story of Irena is so engrossing and the most valuable asset of the film that disclosing even the smallest of details might weaken the movie's effect. This movie is worth seeing with a companion so you can discuss its qualities and ponder of the true nature of the movie's end and I used the word Enigmatic in this review far too many times already.There are a couple of matters that I do prefer to clarifyThe movie is the reason why people make movies and why people like yours truly enjoy movies so much. Not only there aren't any noticeable flaws in the film there are also no redundant scenes tedious dialog lines that could be discarded or disturbing views that can be eliminated without heavily impairing the overall impression of the film. The disturbing views are usually implied and the ones that are clear appear for a fraction of a second but leaves a far longer impression. Those of you who envision this film as a myriad of scenes of red wine and Lake Maggiore passing through the window of a fiat 500 are in for a major disappointment.The rest though will experience the true effect of a flawless film that leaves an impression that exceeds the limitations of my penmanship.10 out of 10 in My FilmOmeter".

	schema:headline " Roma Film Festival  La Sconosciuta we waited 6 years but it's been worth it!";
	schema:reviewBody "We have been waiting for Tornatore since Malena in 2000 and now he has come back with this drama thriller with a rather melodramatic plot inspired by the often very tragic news stories about the exploitation of women from East Europe in Italy. The main character the Ukranian Irena played by the wonderful and hardly known Russian stage actress Xenia Rappoport has something very mysterious about her. She pursues an obscure aim concerning the young Italian couple whom she works for and their 5 years old daughter. At the beginning the film has something very hitchcockian about it then it turns to melodrama with many emotional moments don't forget your hankies! There are few very hard scenes with much violence mental and physical. Tornatore does the usual good work. In this film he could count on a capital cast including besides Rappoport the cream of the crop of Italian acting an hairless and extremely sleazy Michele Placido the very good Claudia Gerini and Pierfrancesco Favino Alessandro Haber Piera degli Esposti and Margherita Buy who agreed to appear just a few minutes by the end of the film. Clara Dossena the child actress who play one of the key characters of the film is not only incredibly cute but also much talented. A very remarkable thing is the score by maestro Ennio Morricone. Some critics said it's too invasive but God it's beautiful. I think you will love the sweet and heartbreaking Lullaby theme. On the whole a convincing film. Probably the best of the first Roma Film Festival. My rating is 810".

In order to gain access Irina bribes the janitor into getting work as a maid. She seeks Gina a woman who works for a couple that make jewelry in their spacious apartment. It is clear Irena has something else in mind and couldn't care less for Gina.When Gina suffers an accident Irena applies for the position and surprise surprise she gets it. The rapport with the little girl Tea becomes apparent. Valeria Adacher the lady of the house warns her about Tea who has what appears to be a neurological condition that makes her fall and cannot get up by herself. She also tells her not to enter her workshop ever. Irina spots the safe where the jewelry is kept. Naturally one assumes then her interest in gaining access to the house is to steal but no she has something else in mind as we watch her going over some papers that are kept locked up. Valeria and her husband Donato seem not to be a happy couple. They are heard loudly arguing in the background by the maid so all is not right in their home.Irina and Tea form a tight bond something that Valeria notices right away. The maid wants to teach the girl how to overcome her handicap and to this end she ties Tea and pushes her to the mattresses on the floor and coaxes her into getting up using her technique. In our minds we begin wondering if there is more in Irena's attitude toward Tea because it is a rare thing for a house maid to become so involved in making better someone that is not even related to her.In flashbacks we get to know a little bit of Irena's past. She has been turned into a prostitute by Italian criminals who import these poor girls from Russia. She meets a young man who seems to love her. Since she is what she is this lover is made to disappear by Mold the vicious man that controls her. Irena discovers where he has stashed his cash and tries to kill Mold with scissors but unknown to her he survives. Mold has a way of turning up when he is least expected.Things turn out wrong for Irena when Valeria discovers her dark secret. She fires her and forbids her to go near Tea. Unfortunately Valeria dies in an automobile accident for which Irena is accused of masterminding. At the same time things about the mystery surrounding the Russian woman are revealed. In her trial she is convicted and sent to prison. As the film concludes we see an older Irena who is released after serving time and as she waits for a bus who would show up to meet her?Giuseppe Tornatore the talented Italian director of the hugely popular Cinema Paradiso and Malena just to mention two of his previous films makes us get involved with this complex story. Working with his collaborator Massimo DeRita he has created a multi layered melodrama that involves the viewer. The only problem is that many things are not completely explained. Thus there is a hint that Donato Adacher has a lot to do in the story although his participation is a subtle one. The other mystery is Gina who for all appearances dies in the accident but later is seen at the nursing home in a catatonic state but is she really? The idea that Mold can survive the stabbing is hard to digest after all it's a big stretch of the imagination to think he can still be around after what Irena does to him. Mr. Tornatore is obviously playing with the viewer in making him believe to look at things a certain way while he is deceiving our perception of the plot. If all that is superfluous then the viewer is going to have a great time.Best of all in the film is Ksenia Rappoport who plays Irena convincingly. She runs away with the film. Ms. Rappoport pulls us into the story without doing much. Claudia Gerini's Valeria is also an asset in the film. Alessandro Haber who plays the janitor has some excellent moments. Michele Placido is seen as the obnoxious criminal Mold. Margherita Buy one of the best Italian actresses working these days puts in an appearance at the last part of the film. Finally Clara Dossena makes a valuable contribution as Tea the sweet child in the story.The musical score by the master of all movie composers Ennio Morricone will stay in our minds for a while. Fabion Zamarion's impeccable cinematography makes a great impression. We await Mr. Tornatore's next film impatiently.".

	schema:reviewBody "I did not know anything about the movie except that it was made by the director of Malena a movie that I did not like that much except its images and story line. I had totally no expectations from this one and I sat wondering what is to come.The story is about a Ukrainian girl Irina Russian actress Kseniva Rappoport who comes from a small village and has a lover who is a construction worker. Due to dreams of becoming rich and famous she becomes a prostitute and is exploited by a pimp Muffa Michele Placido who kills the lover sells off the newly born child of pregnant Irina and sadomizes  beats Irina in sex work. The movie is extremely mysterious with Irina's past unfolding with tits and bits of flashback while she works as a house maid for a small family  Valeria Claudia Gerini her husband Donato Pierfrancesco Favino and their daughter Tea Clara Dossena  in an Italian city. I won't tell you the whole story here and spoil the great viewing.Famous Italian Director Giuseppe Tornatore directs this movie after six years of gap and comes out with a winner. The movie has its thrills drama and emotions that keep the audience on the edge of the seat. There are some disturbing violent and sexual content in the movie.Kseniva is so beautiful and acts brilliantly throughout  displaying the range of emotions that a few actresses get to enact in their entire career. Michele Placido as Muffa is scary and real mean. The stealer performance is by Clara as a 5 year old daughter who acts naturally. Claudi and Pierfrancesco are also good.Giuseppe always extracts excellent cinematography and background musical score so does he this time.In the last 20 minutes the movie looses its hold a bit but all in all it is a great movie viewing. I do not know Italian or the Dutch subtitles  but good movies do not require local language to communicate and good directors are not restrictive with any aspects of constraining mediums of cinema.That is the brilliance of classical form of movie making! Stars 7.25 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "This extraordinary Italian psychodramacrime thriller with its heavy SM undercurrent and stylish scenes of sexual torture is almost a Spaghetti Pink Film. It is not what I expected from the director of Cinema Paradiso but Sweet Jesus! I was mightily impressed. What we know from the outset about the Unknown Woman of the title played with immense courage by Kseniya Rappoport is that she's had a life of physical abuse brutal rape and shocking exploitation. She's presently engaged in a scheme to hide from her jailers while searching for a a considerable stash of money. After committing a shocking crime she gains the confidence of a woman whose young daughter she feels connected to. It isn't long before our heroine is schooling the young girl in the art of survival by slamming her head repeatedly to a hardwood floor. It is scenes like the woman's abuse of the girl amongst others that make The Unknown Woman a harrowing experience. I will spare you the film's most exciting and earthshattering revelations but rest assured you're in for a a hellish journey. The film's musical score courtesy of Ennio Morricone is a masterpiece and hearkens back to some of the maestro's best giallo scores. The film is heavy on nudity and bloodshed though because it is built on such a strong characterbased screenplay it never becomes an exploitation film. From performances to production design this is top notch filmmaking with a bleak sharp center. I enjoyed every razeredged minute of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tornatore has already earned a spot in cinema's hall of fame with its tribute to the movies. He certainly took his time to come up with a film that comes close to match the masterpiece Paradiso is and he might have surpassed it with its emotional impact. Paradiso builds on nostalgia and sweetness Woman is a raw better executed project that explores emotions ranging from sweetness to plain relentless evil.Kseniya Rappoport plays the title role and does what very few actresses have ever managed to do a nearly flawless performance a role of such magnitude and complexity that might serve as inspiration for future generations in the way Vivien Leigh and Meryl Streep set the bar before in Gone With the Wind and Sophie's Choice. Both of those films introduced women who survived without ever allowing their spirits to become sad entities. Instead they thrived in the devastating circumstances of each's ordeal. Irena is another survivor one that can't allow anything to lose her focus. She is driven to recover some of the happiness she found and lost and with her new family she might just do that.Tornatore's storytelling is not linear and it is one hell of a story one that will grab your interest squeeze your heart until it begs for mercy and one that is bound to provoke more than a few uncomfortable reactions in the audience as it unfolds each of its many layers. It is modern day Italy and a woman shows up in a building asking for work in order to survive. Soon we learn she has apparently more than enough resources to do very well on her own but she has a rather dark and traumatizing past one that is still haunting her and as we eventually discover one that might prove to be lethal to a few people in the story.Irena is a formidable woman a determined fighter who learns quickly and uses her resources fearlessly. She is no superwoman and eventually learns that her past is still very much affecting her current decisions. Watching the movie it is hard to keep your eyes away from Irena as she slowly gets closer and closer to her goal. As we observe her actions and arrive to the heart stopping final minutes of the film we also wonder what is it that kept her trapped for so many years since she is so able to manipulate people in her current incarnation. It is the only time we question the character's make up yet we can also remember that Darwin argues the fittest will survive.The film is a work of exquisite writing and editing with sure direction by Tornatore and one superb score by Ennio Morricone one that only adds more power to individual scene and is as memorable as some his classic compositions. Woman is guaranteed to keep your eyes glued to the screen and pretty much like 4 Months 3 Weekss and 2 Days last year will leave you gasping for air and reaching for your heart as we become witness to a story that will pull you its powerful reach but will also repulse because of some dark elements in the make up of human nature.It is an instant classic!".

	schema:headline " Ridiculous collage of pastiches disguised by a surprising polish";
	schema:reviewBody "A thriller set in Trieste by the maker of 'Cinema Paradiso' 1988 and the more recent but less remembered 'Malena' 2000 but also the creditable 'A Pure Formality' 2004 this film focuses in a particular way on one of Italy's new Slavic immigrants Irena Kseniya or Xenia Rappoport a young woman from the Ukraine who cleans a wealthy couple's house and develops a very special relationship with their daughter. So a general description of the film might go. Anyone who comes to this film in the expectation of getting a credible account of the immigrant experience in Italy will however be disillusioned. Slavic women who come to Italy penniless may be used as prostitutes on the way to making a decent living as Irena is. But their lives happily for the safety of the Italian home will not be like hers.Irena works very hard beginning with scrubbing the big spiral marble staircase of an apartment building. But Irena never makes a decent living. She has a special reason for going to work in this building for the Adacher family Claudia Gerini and Pierfrancesco Favino and their little daughter Clara Dossena which we only learn later. What we find out right away is that she is ready to cheat and even kill to get this job. She steals keys and a remote beeper and knocks an old housekeeper down a long flight of stairs permanently disabling her.Meanwhile whatever Irena is up to she is doomed because she is being pursued by a sadistic shavenheaded goldchained pimp. Muffa which means Mold is his name and he's played by Michele Placidowho recently was a gentle whitebearded Dominican friar in Mario Monicelli's 'Desert Roses'also part of this Italian film series it's a small world. Irena thinks she's killed Muffa. But she's wrong. He's coming to get her he's mad and he's more sadistic than ever.The Adacher family is dysfunctional. The husband screams at the wife and their little girl Teo who's alternately cuddly and manipulative has a strange complex or illness she can't defend herself. You may have thought that just meant she was a girl. But she also can't put out her arms to break a fall. Irena tries to cure this by binding her arms and legs and knocking her over. That seems inexplicable till we learn through the everincreasing and always violent flashbacks that something like that was done to Irena by Muffa.The storytelling in 'The Unknown Woman' is so baroque so mannerist so melodramatic so violent and ultimately so preposterous that it would be met with howls if it were in English. American reviewers for the art house audience are calling it stunning however and it does have some elaborate cinematography and editing a goforbroke performance by Rappoport and a cast including Michele Placido and Alessandro Haber as the Portiere building superintendent who small world again was the major in Monicelli's 'Desert Roses.' There's a melodramatic score by the venerable Ennio Morricone imitating Bernard Hermann designed to screw up the tension to the maximum. All these aspects add up to a polished package to mask the fact that this is just an elaborate mess.There is no introduction. Irena simply comes on the screen looking stressed an expression she wears for most of the picture. Her story will be told in flashbacks.

	onyx:emotionText "A thriller set in Trieste by the maker of 'Cinema Paradiso' 1988 and the more recent but less remembered 'Malena' 2000 but also the creditable 'A Pure Formality' 2004 this film focuses in a particular way on one of Italy's new Slavic immigrants Irena Kseniya or Xenia Rappoport a young woman from the Ukraine who cleans a wealthy couple's house and develops a very special relationship with their daughter. So a general description of the film might go. Anyone who comes to this film in the expectation of getting a credible account of the immigrant experience in Italy will however be disillusioned. Slavic women who come to Italy penniless may be used as prostitutes on the way to making a decent living as Irena is. But their lives happily for the safety of the Italian home will not be like hers.Irena works very hard beginning with scrubbing the big spiral marble staircase of an apartment building. But Irena never makes a decent living. She has a special reason for going to work in this building for the Adacher family Claudia Gerini and Pierfrancesco Favino and their little daughter Clara Dossena which we only learn later. What we find out right away is that she is ready to cheat and even kill to get this job. She steals keys and a remote beeper and knocks an old housekeeper down a long flight of stairs permanently disabling her.Meanwhile whatever Irena is up to she is doomed because she is being pursued by a sadistic shavenheaded goldchained pimp. Muffa which means Mold is his name and he's played by Michele Placidowho recently was a gentle whitebearded Dominican friar in Mario Monicelli's 'Desert Roses'also part of this Italian film series it's a small world. Irena thinks she's killed Muffa. But she's wrong. He's coming to get her he's mad and he's more sadistic than ever.The Adacher family is dysfunctional. The husband screams at the wife and their little girl Teo who's alternately cuddly and manipulative has a strange complex or illness she can't defend herself. You may have thought that just meant she was a girl. But she also can't put out her arms to break a fall. Irena tries to cure this by binding her arms and legs and knocking her over. That seems inexplicable till we learn through the everincreasing and always violent flashbacks that something like that was done to Irena by Muffa.The storytelling in 'The Unknown Woman' is so baroque so mannerist so melodramatic so violent and ultimately so preposterous that it would be met with howls if it were in English. American reviewers for the art house audience are calling it stunning however and it does have some elaborate cinematography and editing a goforbroke performance by Rappoport and a cast including Michele Placido and Alessandro Haber as the Portiere building superintendent who small world again was the major in Monicelli's 'Desert Roses.' There's a melodramatic score by the venerable Ennio Morricone imitating Bernard Hermann designed to screw up the tension to the maximum. All these aspects add up to a polished package to mask the fact that this is just an elaborate mess.There is no introduction. Irena simply comes on the screen looking stressed an expression she wears for most of the picture. Her story will be told in flashbacks. In the latter half of the film she also regularly goes to a nursing home to visit the housekeeper she's disabled who can't speak and tells her more of her story which we're allowed to hear. And the flashbacks go from milliseconds long to a minute or so. It develops that Irena as a prostitute had a handsome construction worker as a lover Nicola di Pinto. Her time with him seems to be her only happy memory. Everyone in the building almost is in the gold jewelry business and Mrs. Adacher designs and makes jewelry a process not realistically rendered.

It's too bad that the style and substance of the film will prevent it from ever becoming popular because her portrayal of suffering and sheer determination is one for the history books. The woman's got chops. She moves like an insect through the undergrowth of her seedy milieu with an androgynous unkempt beauty that's both tempting and invisible. She's able to shift her portrayal from one emotion to another and then another without moving a muscle in her facea skill few actors possess. It's her story and we follow her through it not knowing exactly what she's after or what she will do with it when she seems to have it in her grasp. That's the unknown part and Rappoport plays the mystery for all it's worth. She works the complex narrative inside her head and lets the revelations drip out slowly uncontrollably.Director Giuseppe Tornatore says this film is about a woman reclaiming her power as a woman there's a great big serving of motherhood with that after it has been stripped from her from every angle imaginable. Rappoport's character is the victim of a human slave trade that uses immigrant Eastern European women to make babies for the upperclass. She's gotten out of it but with a lot of baggage. Some of it is misplaced and some of it is hurled at us in short chaotic flashbacks in the beginning of the film that's the hard to follow part slowly unfolding to more understandable scenes as they catch up with her present life at the end of the filma nice structural technique by the director.Roger Ebert wrote a review of this movie which essentially lists the aspects of it he thinks he understands and the aspects he thinks he doesn't. He scores a little above average I think which is about as good as anyone is probably going to do. There's a noirish component not a stylistic one to the film where major events and character traits are unleashed which are way beyond the reality of any mere mortal's life. There are also plenty of causeforpause moments when you will consider if the means justify the end. That's the hard to swallow part but I'm not complaining. It is a movie after all and if you've read many of my reviews you know that I take all comers when it comes to plot gymnastics as long as they don't infringe upon the integrity of my players as long as they don't cause incredulity to appear on the faces of the actors because they don't believe the script. Giuseppe Tornatore is lucky or smart to have enlisted an actress with the strength of Xenia Rappoport. ET coulda popped in here and I don't think she would have missed a beat.Speaking of beats Ennio Morricone scored this film with superbly.".

	schema:headline " Better not to know the Unknown Woman";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this in April at a screening of the Desert Film Society in Palm Springs. From Italian directorwriter Giusppe Toranatore best known for Cinema Paradiso this is the story of Irena Kseniya Rappoprt a Ukrainian immigrant who has become a prostitute in a European sex slave operation in southern Italy. The sadistic Mold Michele Placido besides pimping his sex slaves also uses them as baby machines in an underground adoption ring to unwitting upper middle class and wealthy childless couples. After stealing a large sum of cash from Mold Irena escapes to the northwest of Italy with a plan to become the nanny of a couple Donato and Valeria Adacher Claudia Gerini and Pierfrancesco Favino to be near their child Tea Clara Dossena who she believes to be one of those that she gave birth to. To infiltrate the family she must first find someway to get the job from their current nanny Gina Piera Degli Esposti. Released in 2006 this was Italy's official submission to the Academy Awards committee for Best Foreign Language Film of 2007. With a reworked story this could have been a suspense thriller reminiscent of Hitchcock but Toranatore takes it over the top as he attempts to add violence gore and an uncomfortable tension reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino but without the humor. The implausible plot and improbable storyline of this film that never really decides what direction its going in is held together by a strong cast led by Russian actress Rappoport. Through a series of flashbacks you get weary of trying to piece this story together with no satisfying payoff. One can soon come to dislike the title character of Irena as the Unknown Woman despite the horrible ordeals she has faced in this very uncomfortable and pretentious film. Nice cinematography from Fabo Zamarion and excellent music from the legendary film composer Ennio Morricone but I would give this a 6.0 out of 10 and not recommend it but hope instead that Tornatore redeems himself with the Lenningrad project that was to be a Sergio Leon film that he's working on. At least we know it will look good and have good music.".

The sadistic Mold Michele Placido besides pimping his sex slaves also uses them as baby machines in an underground adoption ring to unwitting upper middle class and wealthy childless couples. After stealing a large sum of cash from Mold Irena escapes to the northwest of Italy with a plan to become the nanny of a couple Donato and Valeria Adacher Claudia Gerini and Pierfrancesco Favino to be near their child Tea Clara Dossena who she believes to be one of those that she gave birth to. To infiltrate the family she must first find someway to get the job from their current nanny Gina Piera Degli Esposti. Released in 2006 this was Italy's official submission to the Academy Awards committee for Best Foreign Language Film of 2007. With a reworked story this could have been a suspense thriller reminiscent of Hitchcock but Toranatore takes it over the top as he attempts to add violence gore and an uncomfortable tension reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino but without the humor. The implausible plot and improbable storyline of this film that never really decides what direction its going in is held together by a strong cast led by Russian actress Rappoport. Through a series of flashbacks you get weary of trying to piece this story together with no satisfying payoff. One can soon come to dislike the title character of Irena as the Unknown Woman despite the horrible ordeals she has faced in this very uncomfortable and pretentious film. Nice cinematography from Fabo Zamarion and excellent music from the legendary film composer Ennio Morricone but I would give this a 6.0 out of 10 and not recommend it but hope instead that Tornatore redeems himself with the Lenningrad project that was to be a Sergio Leon film that he's working on. At least we know it will look good and have good music.";

This disappointment can stem from the mistakes made by parents in the upbringing of their children or perhaps the simple differences that separate family members. It is this frustration that plagues Christian Bale's character Sam in the film Laurel Canyon.' A wellmade character study Laurel Canyon' explores the reasons for the distress and resentment that can reside between parents and their children. Laurel Canyon' is about a man named Sam Bale and his fianc Alex Kate Bekinsale who move to California so he can begin his medical residency at a local hospital and she can finish her dissertation. The pair moves in with Sam's mom Jane Frances McDormand who is record producer who lives on Laurel Canyon Road in Hollywood. Although she is in her mid 40s she lives the life of a rock star smoking pot drinking partying and hanging out with her rock star boyfriend Ian Alessandro Nivola who is 16 years younger than she. Sam and Jane are always at odds with each other as he is ultraconservative and Jane is like a teenager. The two must weed out their problems and come to terms with each other about the mistakes that Jane made while bringing up Sam. Although a bit slow at times Laurel Canyon' was an interesting film that has its lighthearted and touching moments. It's funny to watch the subtle changes that begin in the characters lives. Alex although conservative like Sam is slowly being drawn into the free spirited world of Jane's home with her parties and rock friends always around. Sam is being tempted by the fruit of another woman named Sara Natascha McElhone as their share their sexual desires with each other over private conversations in a car. And even Jane is beginning to recognize her own faultsshe had several lovers throughout her life is starting to feel the need to settle on just one Ian. Every character starts to understand that they are all the extreme end of different spectrums and they must learn to meet somewhere in the middle. The acting in the film was excellent. Every actor was believable and to a certain extent the audience can feel their pain and happiness.  McDormand Fargo' and Bale Empire of The Sun' steal the show with their amazing abilities to transcend the characters in the script to the dynamic people they present on the screen. Praise must also be given to Bekinsale Pearl Harbor' and Nivola Jurassic Park 3' for their exceptional performances.One other superior quality of Laurel Canyon' was the music some of which was sung by Nivola. The soundtrack holds a great deal of classic rock songs from groups such as Steely Dan' Leroy' and Mercury Rev.'Overall Laurel Canyon' was a very good movie that reminds its audience to look beyond the surface of things and to see what really matters in all relationshipslove.

They expected to stay in his mother's empty home while he worked at a psychiatric hospital and she worked on a thesis.  Due to a schedule change his mother is still in the home when he and his girl friend arrive.  It is obvious that there is substantial tension and resentment on the son's side of the relationship.

His curious girlfriend is drawn into the lives of his mother and her boyfriend Allesandro Nivola with the potential for disastrous results.Frances McDormand does a fine job as the mother.  Christian Bale and Kate Beckinsdale are also good as the young couple.  Allesandro Nivola is entertaining as the mother's current lover.  This is a nicely done film. However something seems a bit flat and the story line doesn't pick up as much steam as a good drama should.  It tends to have a 'so what' mentality about the immorality taking place and the result is that the impact of the film is minimalized.  Christian Bale and Frances McDormand have a poignant scene at the end of Laurel Canyon but again the film strangely mutes the power which the actors imbue their characters with.I'd rate this film a 70100.

I have been a paid critic in the past and have often explained to folks that opinions are just that opinion.  So I will endeavor to explain my case for this fine film.This is a story of a journey.  It is not the journey the characters think they're taking.  It is the odd place they go on their way to what they thought they wanted.  In that way it is a lot like life. You have the fish out of water aspect.  A young couple wonders into his mother's life.  A life he has never appreciated or enjoyed.  His girlfriend on the other hand seems primed for the hedonism she encounters.The mother played to amazing life by Frances McDormand is a record producer with a successful business life and a spotty personal one.  She's in the midst of recording a record when her son descends.  But it is the young man who fronts the group she's producing that has both her and her son's girlfriend in a lather.There are emotional affairs flying about.  There is moral condescension from characters who've been less than honorable.  On top of a good to great cast of principal actors there's the soundtrack of flatout great music. Well directed admirably cast with an ambiguous and thoughtful script plus enough sexual tension to fuel a score of teen comedies.  Great flick.  Bring your moral compass and your ears.".

I have been a paid critic in the past and have often explained to folks that opinions are just that opinion.  So I will endeavor to explain my case for this fine film.This is a story of a journey.  It is not the journey the characters think they're taking.  It is the odd place they go on their way to what they thought they wanted.  In that way it is a lot like life. You have the fish out of water aspect.  A young couple wonders into his mother's life.  A life he has never appreciated or enjoyed.  His girlfriend on the other hand seems primed for the hedonism she encounters.The mother played to amazing life by Frances McDormand is a record producer with a successful business life and a spotty personal one.  She's in the midst of recording a record when her son descends.  But it is the young man who fronts the group she's producing that has both her and her son's girlfriend in a lather.There are emotional affairs flying about.  There is moral condescension from characters who've been less than honorable.  On top of a good to great cast of principal actors there's the soundtrack of flatout great music. Well directed admirably cast with an ambiguous and thoughtful script plus enough sexual tension to fuel a score of teen comedies.  Great flick.  Bring your moral compass and your ears.";

The premise and development are as simple as it can be but simplicity doesn't mean banality. The screenplay in its simplicity has an incredible depth and reliability whether it is on the awkward situations characters get into or the sexual adventures that some of us have been through.

Sam Christian Bale and Alex Kate Beckinsale are an uptight New York couple in complete control of their lives until they move in with Sam's mother Jane Frances McDormand who is a loose hippie in all senses of the words. Jane also has a slew of rockandroll men living in her house most notably Ian Alessandro Nivola her primary boyfriend with an irresistible accent  but then again Jane and Ian don't really label anything especially relationships.As Sam grows increasingly frustrated by his mother's lifestyle Alex grows increasingly intrigued by it. Sam's need to control everything can get annoying but Bale plays well off of Beckinsale's quiet energy. The sexual tension between Beckinsale Nivola and McDormand is electric and is able to keep driving the film forward.The dialogue is funny enough and the actors are all very good that they make up for the slightly predictable plot. At the Independent Spirit Awards Frances McDormand was nominated for Best Supporting Actress and Alessandro Nivola for Best Supporting Actor. Well deserved nominations and quite possibly the best performances of their careers. Be prepared for sexual energy in every direction but I recommend Laurel Canyon.".

	schema:reviewBody "Laurel Canyon' is an intriguing characterdriven drama written and directed by Lisa Cholodenko and featuring firstrate performances by Frances McDormand Christian Bale Kate Beckinsale Alessandro Nivola and Natascha McElhone.  Sam Bale and Alex Beckinsale are recent Harvard med school grads who move to Southern California to begin a new phase in their lives he as a resident in a psychiatric ward and she as a genetics researcher working on her PhD.  While there the young couple moves in with Sam's mother Jane McDormand an aging hardliving but highly successful music producer who owns a gorgeous residence in Hollywood's posh Laurel Canyon that also doubles as a recording studio.  Sam an earnest rigid almost prudish young man has long rejected the freewheeling lifestyle of his mother whom he considers more of an embarrassment than anything else.  The brainy Alex on the other hand who graduated first in their highly competitive class has led a more sheltered' existence and she finds herself strangely drawn to the hedonistic atmosphere she finds here.  Another factor pulling the couple apart is the growing relationship between Sam and Sara McElhone the beautiful young resident who works with him at the hospital.  The fifth element in the mix is Ian Nivola a smoothtalking cocky young singer who though officially attached to the mucholder Jane plays a primary role in getting Alex to loosen up shed her inhibitions and come join their little party.'Laurel Canyon' plays out like a civilized' power struggle with the various characters jockeying for position staking out their territory and attempting to pull certain key individuals into their own respective corners.  Alex with her air of nave innocence is clearly the main prize' here but Sam also feels a noticeable tug from Sara who senses in her coworker a kindred spirit she would like to get to know better.  These are people playing with fire  Jane and Ian in particular  and one of the messages of Laurel Canyon' seems to be that a life conducted without a clear moral code will end up in disaster for all concerned.  However Cholodenko does not seem exactly enamored of Sam's provincialism either seeing it as a wall he has constructed in order to hide from the truth of his own nature.McDormand makes an indelible impression as the intriguing but somewhat pathetic Jane a woman who's failed as a mother primarily because she's never been able to grow up and accept adult responsibility.  The few encounters we are privy to between mother and son are searing in their intensity but Laurel Canyon' keeps its confrontation scenes to a minimum choosing instead to find its meaning in the things that are NOT said rather than in the things that are.  That's a risky strategy that generally pays off though some in the audience may find the subtlety and lack of a clearcut resolution unsatisfying and even frustrating in the long run.  The plotting is sometimes a bit too clearcut and neat for its own good and the parallelism i.e. the simultaneous drifting apart of Sam and Alex due to their respective temptations' sometimes feels forced and obvious.  The parallelism is less obtrusive in the case of Sam's patient a 16year old boy whose drug addiction is placed in stark opposition to the casual recreational' drug use of Jane and her musicmaking cohorts.  Moreover having Sam and Alex be a married couple rather than just boyfriend and girlfriend might have intensified some of the moral complexities and dilemmas faced by the characters.  Still the caliber of both the acting and the writing keeps us involved for the duration of the film.Laurel Canyon' spins a unique tale in a relatively unfamiliar setting and provides five fine actors an opportunity to really display the perfection of their craft.".

Between the generation of hippie organic mama Frances McDormand and her predictably uptight conservative doctor son Christian Bale and his uber egghead grad student girlfriend Kate Beckinsale are the silences of a parent who did her thing and a son who didn't. Literally caught between them is the luscious Beckinsale who comes to enjoy the hedonism the mother's world of music and a young lover Allessando Nivola present. She likes the pot pool parties and 3somes while her fianc dallies with the sublimated lust for a professional colleague Natasha McElhone who is more his cup of straightlaced tea.

	schema:reviewBody "As a huge fan of Frances McDormand I went in seeing this movie with high expectations of her performance and was not disappointed. As the record producer Jane McDormand comes off as both worldywise and vulnerable. Jane's seeking shelter in the storm that is her lifeshe wants to connect with her son and future daughterinlaw and she wants to find happiness in the arms of a much younger man even though deep down she knows the relationship is all wrong. She's terrified of growing old and has managed to combine single motherhood with a successful career. The always smoldering Christian Bale puts in a simmering sensual performance as her sonthedoctor Sam. Kate Beckinsale as good as I have ever seen her since Cold Comfort Farm is Alex Sam's fianc who decides to take a walk on the wild side while out in California. As a somewhat sheltered New Englander she takes like a duck to water the laidback California lifestyle. The transformation is natural and it does her character a world of good.The chemistry between McDormand and Beckinsale is crackling throughout and odd to say there is more chemistry between these two actresses than there is between Beckinsale and Bale. When his character is sexually attracted to a fellow doctor played by the ethereal Natasha McElhone you almost find yourself rooting for the two of them to get together.A friend recommended that I see this movie and I am so glad she didit is severely underrated and an engaging character study.".

As the record producer Jane McDormand comes off as both worldywise and vulnerable. Jane's seeking shelter in the storm that is her lifeshe wants to connect with her son and future daughterinlaw and she wants to find happiness in the arms of a much younger man even though deep down she knows the relationship is all wrong. She's terrified of growing old and has managed to combine single motherhood with a successful career. The always smoldering Christian Bale puts in a simmering sensual performance as her sonthedoctor Sam. Kate Beckinsale as good as I have ever seen her since Cold Comfort Farm is Alex Sam's fianc who decides to take a walk on the wild side while out in California. As a somewhat sheltered New Englander she takes like a duck to water the laidback California lifestyle. The transformation is natural and it does her character a world of good.The chemistry between McDormand and Beckinsale is crackling throughout and odd to say there is more chemistry between these two actresses than there is between Beckinsale and Bale.

There are hints about her musical ears being passe as her house has a lot more shelves and shelves of old LPs than the few new CDs piled up plus the photos of her in studios with past stars. And classic rock seems to always play around her but the excesses and record company pressures don't seem new and she is bedding a rocker 16 years her junior basically her son's age. The realistic musical mise en scene includes appearances by musician Lou Barlow and producer Daniel Lanois among others.The basic tension is supposed to be her being the fascination of the abomination to her straightlaced son Christian Bale pretty much playing the same character as in Metroland and his fiancee Kate Beckinsale pretty much playing the Susan Sarandon role from Rocky Horror Picture Show.  There's also some irony about Bale's character being an effective shrink in training with all his mother issues and a new twist on motherinlaw issues.But that is undercut by virtually all being drawn a la the Rolling Stones' Spider and the Fly song which should be on the soundtrack but isn't by snakestraightfromtheGardenofEden Alessandro Nivola's sexy leader of a rock band that sure looks and sounds a lot like Goo Goo Dolls or Coldplay the film's composer is with the band Shudder to Think and sincerely says all kinds of unbelievable things about commitment and has no problem writing a radiofriendly ballad. I see that he's married in real life to Emily Mortimer which made me think that he was the inspiration for the cause of her character's horrific physical insecurities in Lovely and Amazing but he did give such a very sweet acceptance speech for her at the Independent Spirit Awards. After this movie he could slither into pop music  would he be the first from Phillips Exeter and Yale to take that career path?I have no idea why Natascha McElhone's husbandtemptress is supposed to be Israeli as her mangled accent is just odd.There is a neat running visual leit motif about the different symbolic uses of a California swimming pool by different people from early morning determined laps to late night skinny dipping.The roundrobin apologies and lack of some at the end simply make no sense and leave us finally with no catharsis or resolution.".

I was an ER doc at Santa Monica Hospital 12hr shifts 5 days on 5 days off. I was invited to a lot of parties in Venice Beach Laurel Canyon Malibu. Good memories. I never drink more than 1 beer per day ER docs only see the bad things that happen but I love that life style. It is not for me but I had a great time being part of it. Advice to the director Do this film again. This time get an actress that will jump into it and give it 'her all'. I am not asking for an xxx film but you already have R rating. Do it correctly the next time. Also don't quit so soon. I want to see more with Sam and Sara. I want to see what happens with Alex I married a girl like that and I am a guy like Sam You have a great 'showtime' novel. I could compare it to 'Californication' but with REAL people and a REAL life outcome less drinking and drugs and more REAL life. This is more than one of those daytime soaps. Southern California is an exciting mystery to the rest of the world. I have been around and talked to a lot of people from all over the world. They are all fascinated by California movie people and crazy lifestyles. They may not be real but are exciting and captivating. Most people are like me I could never live that lifestyle but I love to imagine myself in it. I will watch your work long after I retire. You could make showtime a fortune. It is worth 5 seasons minimum.".

	schema:reviewBody "If my wife doesn't fall asleep in the middle of our evening movie I know it's got something going for it particularly if she's seen it several times before. I never get tired of watching this movie either. It has Kate Beckinsale looking especially young and lovely. My favorite part is when she's out running in her leos and stops to take in the view. We see her from the rear and she certainly has a nice figure. Then there's Natascha McElhone Christian Bale's attractive colleague at the mental ward where he works. She gives Kate some real competition which isn't easy to do. The steamy scene in the car where Natascha and Bale confess in explicit terms just how much they want one another has to be one of the more erotic interludes in recent movie history and nobody removes even a stitch of clothing! A quick shot of a young blonde who decides to spend the day in the raw at the clinic provides another interesting moment for the guys in the audience. I especially enjoyed her little speech to Dr. Bale that naked is inner that she didn't wish to conceal her warm supple skin while alluding to the barren desert that is the world out there.Of course the movie has much more going for it than just hot babes in erotic situations. Francis McDormand of Fargo fame who is getting a bit too mature to be judged merely for her appearance although she looks awfully fit for a woman her age nevertheless is interesting to watch and dominates the situation throughout the movie. The way she interacts with the the record company exec who keeps hounding her about getting the album finished before Christmas is always amusing. Her interaction with her son provides some fireworks too. We could do without one or two of the scenes between her her boyfriend and Kate Beckinsale but alas they are integral to the plot's development. The way the band including her boyfriend finish off their work in the studio and arrive at the final hit single they will need to satisfy commercial interests provides a backdrop that carries the story forward surprisingly well. Coupled with the romantic quandary faced by Christian Bale who must choose between fidelity to his fiance Kate Beckinsale and a lustful fling with his alluring coworker Natascha McElhone gives this movie an entertaining edge that is not usually seen in more recent Hollywood offerings. All in all the idea of life in Laurel Canyon is successfully conveyed. You get the distinct sense that the young couple from Boston got more than they bargained for when they moved to L.A.".

This is an ensemble performance so I wont single out any single actor for particular comment the sound track is integral to the film and while present does not overwhelm.

The turn by the patrician lad from Yale as a Brit musician is quite convincing Phillips Exeter's aping of he English tradition is good for something after all.

The war between emotions and logic seems to be eternal and we'll probably never stop writing or making movies about it. In this movie the messages are strong and disturbing specially the relationship of Sam's mother with her daughter in law. No culture can accept this thing as natural and even if it had only a semantic function in the writer's mind it should be presented in a very artistic way in order to make the whole thing work. Something that does not happen here. The movie is filmed like an ordinary family picture with nothing innovative and it's definitely poor in art. In order to make this picture work I believe that they should either erase this sick relationship and keep their crew as it is or keep the original script and call Polanski to film it or something. In brief I believe that this is a lost opportunity. It could have been a great movie but it has turned out to be just sick softcore. Sorry 310.".

The escape scene is terrific with great closeups of Gilbert as he swings on tapestries from the castle walls. It would be interesting to know how they shot these scenes.There are enough comic and action scenes here to dispel the image of John Gilbert as merely some pale and insipid great lover of the silent screen. Gilbert was a solid actor who had appeared in around 70 films by 1926. Gilbert did everything westerns like HELL'S HINGES with William S.

The action is great too. Gilbert radiates sexy appeal in the first part and he was certainly a star which is why no one sees beyond that. But I would like to point out a later scene...Gilbert and the girl see a garden shrine and kneel and she promises eternal love and then turns to him as if to say 'your turn buddy!'. He grins bet won and starts to swear out a phony line only to realize he can't lie now. Suddenly he realizes he is a cad a total lying cad. A fake. A terrible man instead of the 'Magnificent' image he always saw himself as being.Gilbert turns his head away and kneels in total silence and stillness as shame takes over. She goes balistic. He kneels in still and withdrawn shame and the realization what sort of man he really is. She storms away. He still kneels in quiet and now shattering shame not moving very quiet. This is good acting.Gilbert was not just a pretty face of a stupid guy. Gilbert was a film actor who took his job seriously and loved films and believed in films at a time few did. He played characters rather than played his 'star lover persona' and he played cads bad guys funny guys good guys weak guys and even implied bisexuals. He did the role. He did not do 'movie star'.I wish people would rediscover his real talents and see all his films in context to see he did few 'lover boy' films and this clearly makes the title great lover a inside joke!. Instead Gilbert tried to act in many roles and expand his roles to be taken seriously. Alas he is today remembered as a joke when he was tragically anything but.I am glad this film was discovered and restored and put on DVD and I wish his other films would also be put on DVD so the world can rediscover Jack Gilbert. I also recommend the bio Dark Star by his daughter which shows the real man behind the cheap jokes.J E F".

When Mr. Gilbert meets beautiful and rich Eleanor Boardman as Roxalanne he is dared to settle down and get married on a bet. However Gilbert's rival in fashion and love Roy D'Arcy as Chatellerault is also determined to win Ms. Boardman's hand on orders from the King...If Bardelys the Magnificent had not been lost for most of the 20th century it would have built a reputation as a highly regarded and influential classic. The MGM personnel is first class led by director King Vidor and cameraman William Daniels. Writer Dorothy Farnum gives Rafael Sabatini's story a very witty adaptation. Comic relievers George K. Arthur the original Mike Myers and Karl Dane are used well it was after this film that they teamed up as a successful comic duo.Gilbert's rambunctious sensuality is at its peak. It may not have been discussed but Greta Garbo admired this film and had Gilbert do a version of his Bardelys character for Queen Christina 1933 her relationship with Gilbert has been documented but she was also close with underrated costar Boardman and Mr. Daniels who photographed both films. A great cast and crew doesn't always guarantee high art in motion pictures but it happens here. Everyone and everything is stupendous.Some great moments tease along the way to a majestic approximately five minute long sequence involving Gilbert's escape from beheading. Don't miss this part after about 75 minutes of running time you'll want to play it again. Helping make Bardelys magnificent the 3Dlike escape sequence is certainly one of Mr. Vidor's greatest accomplishments. Thanks to everyone who worked with Eric Lange Serge Bromberg and David Shepard in making Bardelys the Magnificent available.

Arthur the original Mike Myers and Karl Dane are used well it was after this film that they teamed up as a successful comic duo.Gilbert's rambunctious sensuality is at its peak. It may not have been discussed but Greta Garbo admired this film and had Gilbert do a version of his Bardelys character for Queen Christina 1933 her relationship with Gilbert has been documented but she was also close with underrated costar Boardman and Mr. Daniels who photographed both films. A great cast and crew doesn't always guarantee high art in motion pictures but it happens here. Everyone and everything is stupendous.Some great moments tease along the way to a majestic approximately five minute long sequence involving Gilbert's escape from beheading. Don't miss this part after about 75 minutes of running time you'll want to play it again. Helping make Bardelys magnificent the 3Dlike escape sequence is certainly one of Mr. Vidor's greatest accomplishments. Thanks to everyone who worked with Eric Lange Serge Bromberg and David Shepard in making Bardelys the Magnificent available.

	schema:reviewBody "Bardelys The Magnificent which put John Gilbert in strong competition with Douglas Fairbanks for screen's best silent swashbuckler is based on a novel by Rafael Sabatini who gave us much good material for those action adventure swashbucklers on the silent screen and in sound. We're far more familiar with work like Captain Blood The Sea Hawk and The Black Swan. Sad Bardelys The Magnificent never got a sound remake the role would have fit either Tyrone Power or Errol Flynn perfectly. Especially Flynn because the story has elements of Don Juan which Flynn so successfully brought to the screen.As the Don Juan of France Gilbert as Bardelys is tricked into a wager with his court rival Roy D'Arcy that he can't get the hand of a young woman widely known for her virtue in those bawdy times of the court of Louis XIII. Later on through a combination of circumstances Gilbert arrives at Eleanor Boardman's estate incognito in the guise of a rebel to Louis XIII. He woos and wins her and as is usual in these romance stories actually falls for her. But you can already see he's got some real problems to win her.John Gilbert was as dashing as any of the other noted swashbucklers of the screen. When dialog was given him when talkies started it was in these kind of roles that his voice did not record well and his career took a tumble. But seeing this you have no doubt of why he was considered a great screen lover. Eleanor Boardman is as virtuous as Mary Pickford or Lillian Gish ever were in their films and she wound up marrying the director of Bardelys The Magnificent King Vidor.For completists the restoration of Bardelys The Magnificent is of great interest to fans of John Wayne. The Duke no doubt under his real name of Marion Michael Morrison was an extra in this film. But with all the men wearing beards and mustaches as befit the period I doubt you could spot him in crowd scenes. And Lou Costello probably under his birth name of Louis Cristillo is also an extra.For Costello this would prove ironical because the actor playing Louis XIII is Arthur Lubin who later became a director of some note and he directed several early AbbottCostello features most notably their breakthrough film Buck Privates.The action highlight of the screen is John Gilbert's escape from the gallows which rivals anything that Douglas Fairbanks did in his film. There is some really clever use of a pike to aid Gilbert in his escape and I wonder if Gilbert did any of that work himself. No doubt MGM frowned on injuring his rather expensive body with these deeds. Of course the real beneficiary of this restoration is John Gilbert and the legacy of work did for the big screen. Bardelys The Magnificent is an expertly staged well done piece of cinema.".

Eleanor Boardman's sedate beauty and restraint as Roxanne brings counterpoint to Gilbert's rakish Bardelys and it's all good chemistry.Director King Vidor who made a star out of Gilbert in The Big Parade the previous year injects Bardelys with his signature crane and exposition shots to bring grandeur to the court as well as depict the hedonistic existence of the let them eat cake crowd.

	schema:reviewBody "Bardelys the Magnificent 1926  out of 4 Adapted from a Rafael Sabatini novel this lavish MGM production features John Gilbert as Bardelys a wife stealing rebel who defies the wishes of the King and just does things his own way. He eventually meets and begins to fall in love with the beautiful Roxalanne de Lavedan Eleanor Boardman but the evil Chatellerault Roy D'Arcy has his own plans for the lady. This swashbuckling saga was lost for many decades until a print turned up in 2006 and in pretty good shape. There's a small section that is still missing but the restorers just used some scenes from a trailer and a photo recreation to help fill these segments in. This is certainly well worthy of being discovered because this is a rare case where a lost movie turns up to be a major find and a good movie at that. The flick is what I'd call a spoof because I think both Vidor and Gilbert are having fun and making fun of folks like Fairbanks and all their swashbuckling action pictures. Just take a look at a hilarious scene early on where Gilbert is kissing a man's wife when the husband comes in the room screaming at him. Gilbert calmly tells him that it's rude to be speaking so loudly and then goes back to kissing his wife. The love story between Gilbert and Boardman is actually pretty good and believable as is the hatred between he and D'Arcy. The ending goes out with a major bang that I won't ruin but some of the stunts here are extremely impressive and especially one where Gilbert must walk up the side of a castle. Gilbert as expected is perfect for the role here as I've never seen him so dashing or charming. I'm not sure what type of make up was used by he seems to have a glow around him as he dashing from one scene to the next. Both Boardman and D'Arcy are good as well even though they can never match Gilbert. Vidor does a fine job at keeping the film moving as the pacing is very good as are the action scenes.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was presumed to be lost to the ravages of time. However recently most of the film was uncovered and restored. Flicker Alley has just released it on DVD and the product is worth seeingthough far from perfect. First a portion of the film is missing and this is dealt with by using production stills and intertitle cards. Considering this is a small portion of the movie this isn't that big a problem and can be overlooked. Second compared to some other Flicker Alley DVDs this one is a bit disappointing as the special features included aren't that special. They aren't bad but after seeing such a magnificent collection of extras with another recent Flicker Alley release GARDEN OF EDEN I was hoping this DVD would be the same. Still despite these two problems the DVD is still well worth seeing.The film is set during the reign of Louis XIII. Bardelys is a nobleman swashbuckler and lovermuch like Don Juan. He is based on the Rafael Sabatini novel but like all the Sabatini films I have seen based on his books that I have read the story has been changed quite a bit. Still it's smashing good.Bardelys has a fault and that is his pride won't let him back down from any challenge. When his archrival challenges Bardelys to either marry an eligible but chaste noblewoman he acceptsthough he is loathe to marry. In a series of events that can only happen in Hollywood Bardelys' path takes her to this woman and they actually DO fall in love. The problem is that she thinks he's someone else and he is afraid she'll think he won her heart just to win the stupid bet. In the end everything works out swell and they all live happily ever after.The film has some exceptional acting staging and action. I was really surprised late in the film when suddenly the movie looked like a Douglas Fairbanks spectacle. Fairbanks was known for his athleticism and great acrobaticsand in BARDELYS the action is amazingthough I also think that unlike Fairbanks' films a stuntman did most of the action in this film. Regardless it is spectacular and very entertaining. Compared to other silent films of the day this one compares very well and I heartily recommend iteven with a few minor complaints about the DVD.".

The copy seems incomplete outside the missing reel. Where is Edward Connelly's Cardinal Richelieu? The subject is not a good match with the talents of King Vidor. La BOHEME is a much better film and it appears perverse to have him do it when Victor Seastrom one of the originators and masters of the costume movie was on the MGM pay roll.Vidor gives it good try and seems to have a nice rapport with the leads. Gilbert was at his peak and radiates star power here and Eleanor Boardman is a nice departure from heroines in ringlets. Their relationship makes the piece agreeable and the action climax while it is sub Fairbanks is ingeniously staged making great use of the lances and having some striking downward shots.This is an agreeable missing piece in the film history jig saw.".

Gilbert seems underrated today given how popular he was in the 1920's and his personal story  clashing with studio head Louis B. Mayer over his high salary 250000 for each of six films his near marriage to Greta Garbo in what would have been a double ceremony with Boardman and director King Vidor etc  is fascinating.

True the movie is missing a reel but it is not particularly important and the missing footage is adequately supplied by stills and a clip from the trailer. John Gilbert makes perfect work of the dashing selfglorifying hero while to the last man the rest of the players led by supervillainous Roy D'Arcy shine in likewise brilliance. The only shadow in this otherwise truly luminous ensemble is cast by Eleanor Boardman who plays her Roxallane de Lavedan as a Macy's shopgirl rather than as the unapproachable noblewoman demanded by the script. The movie comes to a truly spectacular action climax doubtless designed to outdo such energetic Douglas Fairbanks blockbusters as Robin Hood. Available on a 1010 Flicker Alley DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody " In 1944  during a WWII  a fascism regime has came into power in Budapest. Although the hard circumstances few men come to drink and spend every evenings in a boozer together to speak about their common acquaintances and the proper and finest making of the fresh calf's meat. They are Mr. Gyuricza the watchmaker Mr. Kiraly the book agent Mr. Kovacs the carpenter and Bela colleague the innkeeper. One day an unknown photographer come to join them exactly when Gyurizca put a question in his usual satirical method to the company what if they could rebirth and choose between the roles of the rich tyrant and the tortured slave who's still honorable. What would be? That time they don't know yet that this theoretic question must be answered very soon in a real torture room. This movie paints excellent picture how the dictatorship has worked in deed and how the regime has caught and changed the common people into something they never would became. It's not a 1984 like we've seen that in Orwell's powerful but mostly utopian vision neither it's not really a V for Vendetta which is Hollywood's romantic Zorrolike dream about a totalitarian society. It's the story of the nameless people the nobody who has the power at will but no will to use their power. The director Zoltan Fabri handles the characters properly. The dialogs are great and the filming is amazing. Some people may say it's dark but I think it has more then bright light to show how the regime has manipulated the common people who lived in the country. They didn't print any handout against the regime. They wouldn't explode anything. They just would live in the country. Still. They were hazardous for the regime. Once they got their accordance and reason they got the power and could not be stopped anymore. Or almost not. This is what the regime never let to happen.I think that the main oppressor character formed by Zoltan Latinovics  in my opinion he was the one of the greatest actors who has ever lived has right.'It's tiny issue when somebody drop a bomb to a party house. Some paints things to the walls. It's also tiny issue. Some shoot few friend of ours that's also a tiny issue. Why? Because we are going to catch them and hang up or shoot them. Before or after but finally they will be all dead for sure. So they are all tiny issues. The remaining ones matter! Whose don't explode bomb don't paint or anything. They live among us. They are the mass. We may have some real problem with them.'Fascism or communism. Doesn't matter. Both has followed the same overwhelming clich what Ferenc Santa the writer put so effectively into his characters' mouth. 'These four men have to learn that you really have the right to tell them that their wife is a whore or beat them as you wish. They must memorize that they can do nothing but you can do anything! Keep them in doubts. Let them fear including the innocents and criminals... so you will beat them on a pedagogic basis.'I'm wondering that this movie could be created during the 70s of Hungary for the readers are not native Hungarians we have a communist regime until 1989. But I'm quite sure that the oppressors of that time didn't recognize themselves in this mirror as they acted right after 1956 in the darkest years of the communism. Maybe Mr. Gyuricza the watchmaker said properly. 'The tyrant was sure that he is the best ruler in world because he acts according to the morality of the age and he has right reason.'One more thing in my opinion this movie precisely open up the sad fact that almost all dictatorships have left shame in the nameless survivors' soul for something to hardly let them speak and trust again to each other. It's one of the oppressors' well crafted advantage.In total Excellent movie. Deep and touching. Good acting. Honorable question. What is your choice would be?I can recommend this anyone who wish to know more about that psychology of the theme. Unfortunately the DVD release I got has got only Hungarian language. I hope that some dubs or subtitles are available somewhere for other languages to show this great movie for a greater audience.".

The setting is also surprisingly rich. This is important because a lot of this movie takes place in the same place. I was somewhat worried that this movie would just be people sitting around a table talking. That is more or less the case but it works out nicely. The proceedings are intellectually and spatially dynamic. I was also a bit worried that I wouldn't really be able to understand the film without having the proper cultural context. This turned out not to be much of an issue. I may have missed some things but you can enjoy this film knowing only that its set in some country that is at war. The Bad A large part of this movie is people sitting around a table talking. Like I said I found this to be interesting but it isn't particularly exciting. It isn't inconceivable that some people might find this movie to be boring. I should also mention that I found the final act a drastic departure from the rest of the film to be contrived.

Overall This is an interesting movie. Stark and intellectually engaging the film is surprisingly powerful and surprisingly universal.";

If you didn't saw this movie yet and you like slower philosophical movies go and watch it you wont regret... I think i like this movie the most because i think the same way as the author of the book did.

I call this film a minor release because it was not advertised much just a trailer here and there but it's the type of film that make me happy to work at a cinema otherwise i would have miss out on this little treasure of a film. The story is simple  a lonely widower also a scifi best selling author  adopt a child who lives in a world of his own were he convinced himself that he's a Martian who was sent to earth to study the human race. The child's rather strange he hates the sun and doesn't smile often. At first the writer he's not sure if he's up to the task to bring up a child with such big issues but little by little he realized that he was the perfect match for the boy. In a world were we have countless film about fart jokes and people getting tortured to death  I found Martian Child to be a breath of fresh air. It's a sweet film without being corny. The acting is great all around.John Cusack his wonderful as always but its the young Bobby Coleman who plays Dennis the young boy who's the real star of this film he is great but also likable and god knows how this sort of character could have turned out in the wrong child actor's hands. Joan Cusack bring much of the comic moments in this film and it's nice to see her with her real life brother  I love that woman  she always add something to any film she's in. The most interesting aspect of this film is seeing the character of Dennis progression throughout the film  from a troubled boy to a happy kid  it was really well done. Somme people might found this film overly sentimental but I believe it's because we live in a cynical world and a film like Martian child stand out more in a time when we are not used to see a film that doesn't show violence or gross out humor. The main purpose of the film is to introduced us to two character  make us love them and see them grow together and it does a more then decent job at that. I would recommend this film to anyone who has enough of a open mind to accept a film that just wants to grab hold of our heart for 1 hour and 45 minutes. I think this film is a nice little gem and I don't care about all the critics that found it just too sentimental.For the full duration of the film I was interested by the characters and at the end I was happy for them and thats all I ask for a film  that the character are involving.".

David John Cusack a widowed science fiction writer with writer's block decides to find out by adopting an unwanted boy. The boy Dennis Bobby Coleman outwardly acts as if he is a child from our closest celestial neighbor the planet Mars. David and Dennis appear well suited for each other because they are both living apart from society. David does so by living alone and writing science fiction novels up until the present time of his wife's death now he is just alone. Dennis avoids contact with everyone by taking on the guise of the child from Mars an alien a stranger who acts differently than the norm and therefore society avoids confrontation with what is unusual. This screenplay is adult in nature because it deals with issues that are unpleasant and upsetting. Taking on the responsibility of rearing an unwanted child alone having never actually been a parent and never knowing if the love you give is going to be returned is a huge step! This is a film that will be appreciated by a very small audience. One must first be able to get past self indulgence and reach a certain level of maturity before one can consider taking on the total responsibility of another life form. Director Menno Meyies has created a very strong bond between David and Dennis in their scenes throughout his film. Unfortunately most of the people on this planet will never see their performances. Go out of your way go alone if you must but go see the Martian Child. If you are a parent it will remind you of raising your own children if you are not yet a parent it will remind you of the childhood you had and the experience of raising your own Martian Child yet to come!".

So I went in with a pretty clean slate.The film jumps right into things and doesn't really take a lot of pit stops. It charges forward with the story and I think that is the thing I appreciated the most about it. We are not weighted down with too much subplot and extraneous emotional scenes. We are given exactly what we need to form a connection with all the characters.The film is changed some from the book that it is based on. Mainly that the lead character played by John Cusack is a widower rather than homosexual. In the end it really doesn't matter the sexuality of the Cusack character the connection he creates with his son is fantastic to watch develop. They are the same though different in that one is grounded in reality and the other up in Mars some where. Both are individuals in a world that doesn't want different the want everyone to do exactly as they are expected to.Loved the film will be a definite purchase come DVD time.".

This movie was perhaps one of his best films and most satisfying performances since Say Anything... in 1989. This film had perfect juxtaposition which is on the same standard as Little Miss Sunshine. The movie hits you hard makes you think and just as it's about to make you crysomething outrageously funny happens and you are laughing too hard to even think of crying. Bobby Coleman is perfect in his rolequirky poignant and subtly portrays a character that many children would overact giving Dennis the credibility and relatablity that he deserves. His performance is reminiscent of Johnny Depp in Benny and Joon and this young boy will win just as many hearts. Both leading actors portray their characters perfectly and work so amazingly well together that their performances are seamless. This movie is one of the best I have seen in a long time.

The movie is intelligent funny and loving with some of the finest acting from both John Cusack and Bobby Coleman. It is a mix between Big Daddy and KPax but without doubt has more intelligence and emotion than those two movies! Both Cusack and Coleman form a bond that is so strong and loving you actually shed tears throughout the movie! It is a great film and i am sure that when it is release it will do well at the box office like all of Cusacks movies! Its a feel good piece of art and one of the best of the year!

	schema:reviewBody "While walking with his sister Liz Joan Cusack in the park widower David Gordon John Cusack confesses I just want my life to have meaning... I think what David really is talking about is a personal legacy. David is considering adopting Dennis Bobby Coleman a strange little boy who spends his days in card board box with cut out holes. Oh yes and Dennis believes he is from Mars. He is here on earth to study human beingness. This is the conceit of Director Menno Meyjes's Martian Child. The screenplay by Seth Bass and Jonathan Tolins is based on the novel by David Gerrold. Martian Child really flew under the movie radar. I had heard about it earlier in the year and got the gist of the story. Being a fan of John Cusack and Amanda Peete I was curious to see the Martian Child. More curious was the lack of fan fare or promotion associated with the movie. Martian Child plays much like an independent film except for its talented named cast. Martian Child is reminiscent of KPax with Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey. Where KPax crumbled despite noble intentions with its horrendously ambiguous ending Martian Child has a distinct conclusion without the pretense or ambition. Martian Child is not a great movie. However for what it isit is satisfying. Meyjes's Martian Child is a sentimental tear jerker that is so very earnest and sweet. John Cusack is amazing.John Cusack plays David Gordon a successful science fiction writer. His best selling book is in production as a big budget Hollywood movie. David's agent Jeff neurotic Oliver Platt desperately pleads with David to finish his book sequel draft. Their publisher Mimi Anjelica Huston anxiously awaits the draft so she can throw a coming out party in 6 weeks. That is a little wacky. David's wife and the love of his life died two years ago and since then much of his life is on hold. He lives in a great home with his dog Somewhere. David's best friend is the beautiful and radiant Harlee Amanda Peetehis wife's sister. This makes for a dicey storyline given the way things usually evolve in these situations. Amanda Peete is great here. She has a naturalness and ease.David gets a call from his social worker friend Sophie Sophie Okonedo. Obviously David has reservations about a boy in a box who thinks he's from Mars. Sophie reassures You write about Mars. Thus the experiment begins. David brings Dennis to his home on a trial basis. Dennis wears sun block and sunglasses to counteract being on a planet closer to the sun than Mars. He also wears a weight belt so as not to float away. And Dennis only eats Lucky Charmswhich are magically delicious.David struggles his way through and begins to really see Dennis. Dennis reminds him of his younger outsider self. David also starts wondering whether Dennis is really who he says he is following meaningful coincidences at a Cubs baseball game and Dennis's apparent ability to taste color. This seems like a clumsy narrative device.What eventually wins over Martian Child is the brilliant chemistry between John Cusack and Bobby Coleman. There is an inspired moment when Dennis and David gaze above at the stars. Coleman as Dennis embodies the right awkwardness and innocence. He touchingly asks David Is it good to be like everyone else? John Cusack is funny frustrated and nobly compassionate as David evolves into a caring father. In a moving scene he tells Dennis There is nothing you can do to change the way I feel about you Cusack commands the story's humanity and underlying strength.We all want to make a difference in life. And we all want to able to love and be lovedthat is what it is to be human. Martian Child ultimately celebrates our humanity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Humor and heart blend well in MARTIAN CHILD MaCh adapted by Seth Bass and Jonathan Tolins from science fiction writer David Gerrold's reallife story except that gay David Gerrold is portrayed here as straight widower David Gordon of adopting a little boy who'd been mistreated and abandoned so many times he'd come to believe he was from Mars. As funny and winsome as it is poignant MaCh is one of the few films about an unconventional family life that doesn't pile on eccentricity for eccentricity's own sake showing that it's possible to build a happy life and learn to love others despite the personal flaws and developmentalemotional issues of everyone involved. I loved the rapport and chemistry between David and his adopted son Dennis portrayed endearingly by the everappealing John Cusack reuniting with his MAX director Menno Meyjes and young Bobby Coleman. It made me think of the scene in GROSSE POINTE BLANK with Cusack's Martin Blank holding a baby looking at it with this delightful mixture of puzzlement and wonder. Could that baby have grown up to be Dennis? . The life of a science fiction writer gets some goodnatured ribbing too in scenes where David has to deal with his agent Oliver Platt reuniting with Cusack after his scenestealing turn in THE ICE HARVEST. Now that Cusack's longtime bud and costar Jeremy Piven has a steady gig with TV's ENTOURAGE has Platt become Cusack's new Piven?  and his publisher I won't spoil the wonderful cameo. Joan Cusack also turns up to provide able support for her bro as David's married sister full of harried yet sage advice The thing about kids is they keep coming at you. In fact her family scenes often cracked me up like her admonishment to her rambunctious boys or as she affectionately calls them Omen One and Omen Two Get off that dog! He's 200 years old in human years. Would you do that to Grandma? I loved her husband's attitude Hey all kids are from Mars. At least your kid admits it. Although MaCh takes time to have fun even when things get serious loved David and Dennis's Martian walkdance to the Guster song Satellite and is generally upbeat with quite a bit of gentle humor it doesn't shy away from showing the difficulties of adopting an emotionally scarred child with the frustration and sadness inherent in such a situation. Having adopted our niece after my motherinlaw died I can tell you from personal experience that picking up in the middle of raising somebody else's child is a challenge even in the best of circumstances and MaCh captures this aspect well. It also shows that parents especially those of us raising kids with special needs often walk a fine line between accommodating a kid's genuine needs and being overly if wellmeaningly indulgent. We've adapted David's advice to Dennis for our own child who was diagnosed with ADHD and Asperger's Syndrome When you're at home it's okay to be from Mars. But when you're out in the world you have to follow Earth rules. Perhaps you have to have experience in these kind of family situations to best appreciate MaCh I've noticed that reallife parents tend to appreciate it more than say professional film critics . MARTIAN CHILD should be required viewing for unconventional parents of children with emotional or developmental issues and other serious problems. By the way when I saw MaCh in our local multiplex there were a number of parents seeing the film with kids not tiny tykes but elementary school age and older and they all seemed to enjoy it too.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Tis the season for epic Oscar contending dramas and the ever underperforming family dramasromantic comedies at the cinema. This is really the only time of year when I really crave a good schmaltzfest. The air is cold and dry and I really want to go to the movies and come out two hours later feeling warm and fuzzy and damp from tears of joy. If you're craving a film like that this winter Martian Child might just be the cure for what ails you.The story is unassailably touching. David Gordon John Cusack is a widower who decides to adopt a child. He chooses a hardtoplace child Dennis Bobby Coleman who is convinced he's from Mars. Gordon a science fiction writer is a misfit himself and tends to also escape into fantasy so he feels connected to the child. The story is about their struggle to understand each other and to make the rest of the world just let them be weird.The script is adapted from the David Gerrold novel The Martian Child. It's mostly faithful to the text except that the David in the book is a single gay man. That's probably why the story behind the dead wife is never told and the romance between David and Harlee is never developed or resolved. Those parts are completely secondary to the point of the film. But that makes me wonder why they couldn't have left the character alone. It might just be audience manipulation. It's impossible to not be sympathetic with a lonely widower after all. Nevertheless the introduction of a dead wife did make for a beautiful scene where Cusack is quietly weeping as he flips through old pictures of her.The acting could not have been more convincing. John Cusack usually plays the ultracool andor neurotic urbanite bachelor roles but David Gordon is the first of a few roles where he plays the unfortunate father. In this summer's 1408 Cusack grieved his dead daughter. In the Sundance darling Grace is Gone he plays a widower who takes his two daughters on a road trip while he figures out how to tell them their soldier mother was killed in Iraq. It's a refreshing turn and he pulls it off effortlessly. And as a warning the couple dozen women who aren't already in love with Cusack will surely be won over by his performance in this film.Bobby Coleman is at once creepy and adorable a la Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. Joan Cusack makes her tenth appearance alongside her brother as... his sister. She brings much needed comic relief as the frazzled mother of two boys who attempts to disabuse him of his parental confidence. Amanda Peet turns in a lovely performance as the longtime friend of John's dead wife who obviously would like to take her late friend's place. Oliver Platt is hilarious as Cusack's agent. Angelica Huston redeems a ridiculous scene as his publisher. Richard Schiff of The West Wing fame is the begrudging case worker.The chemistry between the cast members is fantastic probably because the majority of the major players had worked with the star before. John Cusack has appeared in earlier films with Coleman Must Love Dogs Peet Identity Platt The Ice Harvest and Huston The Grifters.The script did leave a little bit to be desired here and there. What it lacked most was subtlety. But a selfrespecting film snob should be able to put that aside and still enjoy the story the acting and the beautiful cinematography. Also director Menno Meyjes who also worked with Cusack once before Max kept the film concise and engaging.For sure every parent would be able to relate with and enjoy Martian Child. It is the mustsee warm movie of the cold season.".

A great cast with both Cusacks playing brother and sister and Amanda Peet as the love interest but with soso performances. What can you really do with such bad writing anyway? The film tries hard in telegraphing a human story yet falls short of its potential. The concept is great but ultimately the filmmakers should have gone back to the drawing board instead of wasting people's time and money. I hear the original novel was great. The film however does not make me want to read it.Not recommended.".

Sure enough there is a lot of good in the movie. The acting standard all around is high although the script did not lend much to Amanda Peet's character. Bobby Coleman in particular shines as a child who must be both eccentric and yet connect with the audience. The script has some clever moments but a lot has been done before and been better handled and a couple of points in the movie drag. In spite of this I was really looking forward to see how the whole story would turn out and I am sad to say it left me hanging. Not so much plotwise but certainly emotionally and it's then the clichs that were masked by some good acting and direction reveal themselves. I'll put it this way. The whole audience remained in the seats for a full 30 seconds when the credits rolling desperately blinking and thinking That's it?In conclusion this is a lighthearted movie with great potential that falls flat on the last laps.".

The other characters provide a balance of emotional artwork and never over shadow or distract from the primary quest. Will this child give up on his fantasy? Will the story take us on a ride? On the surface this film masks as a typical story of the single parent needing to fill a void so he adopts a young foster child who has social issues.

This is a revelation to David for he too was a shy outcast child who developed elaborate stories stories that eventually became his breadandbutter as a leading science fiction writer. But once Dennis is placed in David's home the task of socializing the little boy enough to satisfy the decrees of the social service agencies becomes daunting. Dennis insists he only can eat Lucky Charms and he stealsborrows from others repeatedly among other odd behaviors. But it is painfully obvious that the tiny lad is in a gripping constant fear that David will abandon him too. Can David succeed in making Dennis his true son? This is a lovely film one told with humor and sensitivity. Cusack a very fine performer is excellent as the man who opens his heart up to a troubled scared discardedbyothers little boy. Coleman is also wonderful as the youngster with a giant imagination. The rest of the cast Joan Cusack Howard Hesseman Amanda Peet and others fulfill their roles nicely as well. All of the production niceties such as costumes sets and scenery are more than adequate.

Enough said it's again a wonderful grotesque job as if Americans really don't know what working means! They don't know already that they have millions of poor in their country now they can only find jobs as famous artists advertising agencies high skilled doctors! OK i check as it's a novel adaptation in the original book the father has the same extraordinary job ... except that he is gay! Finally we succumb to the good conscience of American hypocrisy  always present to make stupid movies when homosexuality comes at a surprise one morning imagine me and you grays matters but when it's about true gays they are amnesiac they rewrite to a perfect straight world see also a beautiful mind! In short all the appeal all the curiosity of the movie is lost as such this father can't have the ordinary life of fathers! And it's not all the dialogs are just babble the story wastes the always smiling Amanda Peet and the kid is just annoying to not say bad. Even the Cusacks reunion between sister and brother is flat. So if you try it i'm sure you will do as me after 40 minutes you will check the time and fifteen minutes later you will fastforward to the end.

	schema:reviewBody "This is just a silly stupid terrible movie. It really does appear to me that IMDb is rigged by industry people. When movies come out they have these really high scores. Then the scores lower over time. What the heck.And once again I need to comment on photography and makeup. Have these people ever made a movie in their lives? John Cusack looks like he needs a liver transplant. Even if he did need a liver transplant the whole purpose of makeup is to make people look a certain way. Is that the look the DP was going for? If so he nailed it.So that's what we do now we let people with no talent make movies. OK.Let me tell you what this movie is really about. It's not about an abused kid who John Cusack adopts. It's about a typical lazy Hollywood parent raising his kid. Talking to the kid as though the kid were an adult. Letting the kid do and eat whatever he wants. Then coaching the kid to say and do whatever it takes to get by and get what he wants. Then inflicting the kid on the rest of us. And then we're supposed to see that kid as special. The kid in this movie is training to be a Hollywood producer or the CEO of Enron or a Republican.I really dislike movies where kids especially abused kids are treated as though they have some sort of innate wisdom most of us lack. And I hate movies where kids are spoken to as confessors in an adult way. It misses every point there is to miss.If you want to see a movie where the adult relates to a kid watch George Clooney and the kid who plays his son in Michael Clayton. Nails it.I don't know why John Cusack is trying so hard. Who is picking these scripts for him? But Must Love Dogs and this piece of crap? If I want to watch stuff like this I'll put on the Lifetime channel.".

The script provides us with a story that very effectively ties all these earthly elements together by means of a Martian connection that is pleasing throughout.The whole cast does a fine job with John Cusack providing an exceptionally outstanding performance as David the boy's adoptive father. Young Bobby Coleman does a fine job as the boy Dennis.I especially liked much of the cinematography and scene visuals. This is a very visual movie. The scenes of David and Dennis amid the Christmas lights in front of the house were to me very very appealing. So were the repeated visuals in which we saw a face through a window that partially reflected other things often lights. The lights on the ceiling in Dennis' room and the use of photography by both Dennis and David to help convey and capture and mediate reality ... all of these helped reinforce the credibility of the main conceit.If you see this movie be sure to stay for the closing credits presented amid a pastiche of photos and scrapbooklike visuals that actually provide a quick review of the whole movie.".

He's not the emotional power of 510 years but he does give it good try in Martian Child. But that's enough about John and I still like him for all his work.To sum upYes we've seen it all before in Martian Child and done better. Yes you wind up hoping that the kid actually is from Mars with secret MM tasting and traffic light powers.Given that the movie is sweet and cute. The message is beautiful and hopeful. There is no reason why it is hated by the media critics. The kid Dennis is pretty adorable. Joan Cusack tries hard in another limited role. Amanda Peet is wasted but I still like her history of acting. Oliver Platt is good in a minor role.Either you will like Cusack and the Kid or you will hate Cusack and the kid. I liked them. Just try to forget that you've seen it all a million times before.Give it a shot you might enjoy it. Just let if flow.".

	schema:headline " Sunny feel good movie with a great Cusack.";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm feeling quirky today so let's start with a funny anecdote What do you do when you're a writer with not enough inspiration when the originality well has dried up? Well most of the time you write a story about a...that's right...a writer. And what do you do when you're the producer of a script about a writer and the originality well has dried up? You cast good old Johnny Cusack of course D. It's remarkable how much he is cast as a journalist or a writer. And I understand the producer's reflex I mean...Cusack does have the appearance of a writer. Don't ask me why it's not just the hair although the stylish hair is writerlike. It's ineffable. 'Martian Child' centers around the relationship between a widowed writer David of bad! sciencefiction and a child Dennis who is a Protejunior figure. Prote in KPax is a peculiar man who claims to be from outer space. He behaves very oddly and seems to have special 'nonhuman' powers. Dennis is almost identical he can taste colors has so called 'martian wishes'... The scenes in which we learn Dennis' 'powers' are comical enough but the film only flies high in the comedy sky when it's being genuinely original and clever. The 'breakthrough' scene comes to mind immediately. That scene was so unexpectedly disarming it almost made me cry. Another hilarious moment for me was the flashback to 1408 scene. Actually made me laugh out loud literally at which point the people around me looked at me like I was the one from Mars . The film isn't a flatout comedy though that's not what it's really about. The director deals with a lot of themes mainly centering around 'growing up'. Judging people dealing with loss coping with being loved or loving someone more than you love yourself having the courage to be yourself. A lot of bonding between the characters is shown even the ones who don't seem to get along at first get closer. The film takes a surprisingly mature approach to the all in all hard themesa quality which the recently seen indie film 'King Of California' also had. The director knows when and how to be serious although the overall tone remains light of course. A nice line that was right on the money was 'isn't that weird enough'. In the context it was really meaningful and wellused. Moral lessons like that is what is missing from KPax. Like so many movies the parts of when MC is being sincere are the best. The line 'You're the easiest kid in the world to love' really was delivered like it was heartfelt and it probably was. I'm sure even John Cusack has been insecure in his life...There are lots of great lines of dialog but they are sometimes too explanatory. You seem to be so eager to become the child's friend  you forget to be a parent!. The story already tells us that so there's no need to really actually say it. Another line which I made me cringe was 'Why can't you just be who we want you to be'. Quirky and honest lines like the following help make up for that flaw though 'That's a good question which is usually what adults say if they don't know the answer'. To me this is something John Cusack could say in real life. This strengthens my belief that the role was written in detail for the actor. He had some really excellent scenes but 'I can not tell a lie' he did fall back on his nervous fast talking mumbling charming goodhearted guy routine sometimes.What I really liked was the camerawork Menno Meyjes seems to have a sense of how to create a magic feeling on screen. I love the car scene where all the different colors are reflected in the car windows constantly changing. Sometimes the magic crossed over the line into Cheesinessland. There is a thick layer of that cheesiness similar to the one in Finding Neverland but it doesn't bother me that much. The movie isn't all Disney of course there are really sweet moments all around too. Finding Neverland did have better child acting. In a way the child actor in this reminded me of McCaulay Culkin's fame making role in Home Alone. Over the top almost cartoonish. More irritating was the 'Disneylike' music. The story's less predictable than usually in the genre of course we all knew he's gonna get the kid and A.Peet and him are gonna form the perfect couple which did NOT happen to my astonishment. A. Peet did not come off quite as convincing as she usually does IMO. The chemistry with Cusack was once again great see Identity but the character itself was quite bleak and onedimensional. Another predictable thing was the 'martian wish' that John would use in the end it indeed as expected was important in the climax. I have to be honest there was some unexpected originality in the end. I really didn't see it coming though the obvious returning motives were present Martian wishetc.To make up for the twinklelight music were some very fun indie songs I wouldn't have mind if they'd put in more. What makes this movie work is that almost everyone can identifyrelate with one of the reasonably 'human' lol characters. The dad and the son with their similar acceptance theme the sister who just want to be normal and has lost her zest for life and her wonderment a little bit. I found myself genuinely wide smiling throughout a big part of the movie. Testament enough to the feelgood factor of the movie...All the signals indicate sunshine and no clouds in J. Cusack's acting career. He seems to be back on a good roles run his recent part in 1408 was very convincing too and he's good in Martian Child as well.Very highly recommended!".

Although we wasted 3.99 and two hours of our lives at least we didn't encourage the waste of resources used to make another DVD. Out of curiosity I decided to see how this movie rated on IMDb. I was shocked to find that it had a rating of 6.9. That's about 6.9 points too high. Someone posted a review putting this in their top 5 movies of all time. What is wrong with people? The story was the usual predictable simple minded formulaic designedtotugatheartstrings schlock spewed out in the vast majority of mainstream movies. The Cusacks were good but they were playing pretty much the same characters they play in every movieneurotic good natured quirky siblings. We suspect that they signed up for this project because they had some bills to pay. Same with Oliver Plath Angelica Houston and Amanda Peet. And the kid...I'm sorry but his performance was terribly irritating. I'm not bagging on the kid but the adults who directed him and the writers who produced such a stereotypical cutequirky and nonthreatening troubled orphan. As far as timing and location of the events in the film where in the world do cherry trees blossom in December? Why would anybody start a kid in school a few days before winter break? Where do they play baseball in December? It just doesn't make sense and inhibits suspension of disbelief necessary to watch this movie. We found ourselves wondering why was this movie made? It didn't say anything to add to the existing body of work about being an outsider or accepting differences or the challenges of parenting. Go watch Pretty in Pink The Breakfast Club Stand By Me Parenthood etc. All much better movies with some similar themes. While it didn't add much thematically this movie did add a lot more product placement than those other films which suggests to me that the movie was really about just producing something with big enough name people in it to get enough of us rubes to throw some money at the studio before we realize that it's complete and total crap that we've been fed. Avoid this movie. And lets try being a little more critical so maybe they'll stop making garbage like this and the otherwise talented actors will have to choose projects that may actually challenge them to act.".

	schema:reviewBody "After enduring trailer after trailer with endless stings of explosions ridiculous CGassisted stunts and mindless action I felt very rewarded with an intelligent and intriguing film that defies the status quo of bigger and louder is better. The Good Sheperd doesn't insult your intelligence it stimulates it sometimes confuses it and forces you to look several layers beneath the surface. It feels like a throwback to another era of films when the complexity of a character was of greater importance than spectacle. De Niro took a page from his producer's best work Francis Ford Coppola emulating films like The Godfather The Conversation and Apacalypse Now. The drama rises not from the usual blatant conventional devices but rather by raising questions because of what we're not told and not shown. It requires a great deal of courage to use this style as films have gravitated more and more toward assuming the average moviegoer is of substandard intelligence. The scope of the film is enormous yet the point of view is narrowly focused to be seen through the eyes of one man. There are a dozen of subplots but all are carefully tied into the throughline of the story to match the main character's progression. The film may require some understanding of American history from WWII through the Kennedy administration. It starts with the later years of the story The Bay of Pigs debacle and traces the steps that lead to it one of the more embarrassing moments in the history of U.S. foreign policy. I found it a bit annoying that Matt Damon's character Edward Wilson barely seemed to age in the film while others around him did the best way to determine his age is whether he's wearing wirerimmed or hornrimmed glasses but it didn't ruin the film for me. Overall though definitely one of the best films of 2006. A rare film that makes you want to think and understand rather than forget.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Good Shepherd 3.54 45The Good Shepherd is an incredibly complex work and one of the finest films of a quality ripe 2006. Oscar winner Eric Roth continues his brilliant work with this original screenplay named one of the best unproduced scripts in Hollywood in the late 90's. A film about one of the CIA's founding officers isn't a dream project commercially for a studio but thankfully the quality of the script was too great to ignore.Shepherd follows the life of Edward Wilson Damon through his college years at Yale to his ascension as one of the CIA's founding officers and trusted veterans. His extraordinary dedication to his work comes with an unbearable price as he must sacrifice his family to protect his country. At one point in the film Wilson faces an enormous choice does he abandon his ideals for what he believes is right? Would this abandonment render his life almost solely devoted to his country meaningless? This as well as a depiction of the result of Wilson's decision are just two of the moments of brilliance in The Good Shepherd.Wilson inhabits a world of betrayal and secrecies only enhancing the irony of the biblical quote inscribed on the CIA's wall And ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free. While we are given a glimpse into the life of a younger more vital Wilson the world he occupies creates the characteristically stolid humorless man we come to know.With its vast emotional core the film seemingly effortlessly navigates one of the most volatile periods in the history of American intelligence while remaining character based. At 165 minutes it is overlong but remains engaging for the vast majority of its running time. Had a few relatively insignificant scenes been cut Shepherd could have retained the thrilling and energetic pace it often possesses. However the length is justifiable as the scope of the film is incredibly large and very few scenes can be deemed unnecessary or dull. Robert DeNiro's direction far exceeds that in his debut 1993's A Bronx Tale. Normally portrayed as a brute here DeNiro assuredly handles every moment with an innate tenderness we rarely see in his work. He appropriately treats Shepherd with a precise attention to detail often attributed to some of the greatest directors of our time.A silently haunting Matt Damon carries the film on his shoulders. Edward Wilson is completely introverted and while Damon internalizes his thoughts some of the films greatest moments are when emotion unknowingly pours out of Wilson through a mere flicker in his eyes. Angelina Jolie and Michael Gambon deliver very strong turns amidst a one of a kind cast topped off by the return of Joe Pesci whose last acting stint was 1998's Lethal Weapon 4.The Good Shepherd is a film that demands to be seen. It is surprisingly apolitical as Wilson's life and its disintegration are the true story of this epic. While some call it unsentimental exactly the opposite is true. It is a testament to Roth's script that a film with such an introverted protagonist provides such a visceral affecting experience. Shepherd is an intelligent poignant look at the cost of blind dedication and constant secrecy. The effect this has on Wilson's life is irrevocable as we are taken on a remarkable cinematic journey one that should be remembered as one of 06's greatest.".

	schema:reviewBody "A gray winter day was a fitting time to see one of the first public screenings of a film called The Good Shepherd whose chilly hero Edward Wilson Matt Damon in a role modeled in part on CIA founder James Jesus Angleton is not so much all things to all men as nobody to anybody. A composite figure in a portrait of the birth rise and moral shriveling of the American CIA Matt Damon's disturbingly shutdown Wilson would be one of recent film's most tragic figures if he were not such a hollow unappealing man. Directing a longcontemplated project using a screenplay by Eric Roth who penned Munich Robert De Niro has forged a Godfather of Yankee spycraft a heavy solemn epic about betrayal and loyalty in the world of espionage and counterespionage dominated not by Italians as in the original Godfather though Coppola produced De Niro directed and Joe Pesci has one of the liveliest on screen moments but by uptight stony patrician WASPs.Indeed as seen here the world of American intelligence is a privileged and exclusive and deeply conflicted one where Irish blacks and Italians need not apply fathers are absent privilege grows out of Skull and Bones at Yale wives are betrayed sons labor desperately to measure up and the leading practitioners are ridden with guilt and suspicion. There is no one to trust and nothing to believe in  not family or tradition or even music  only America which Edward Wilson says belongs to his class. All others are just visiting.Into this demoralizing story damning in its picture of the world of white privilege and of intelligence itself but nonetheless intricately involving and at times genuinely disturbing are woven some of the major incidents and personalities of the period from from before the Second World War  after which OSS morphed into CIA till after the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion under JFK from hot war to cold war. You have Philbys and fake Russian turncoats CIA execs siphoning off money to Switzerland in guise of chocolate boxes and through it all you have a Cuba mole investigation that smashes Wilson's own family.Wilson's true penchant was for a deaf girl named Laura an excellent Tammy Blanchard and with her is the only time Damon seems to develop human warmth. He is forced to marry the more elevated Margaret Russell an uncomfortable Angelina Jolie sister of one of his Skull and Bones colleagues who remains Wilson's Old Boy link to privilege ever after. Traumatic embarrassment revelation of closest held secrets and doubt of loyalty are seen as inborn elements of the espionage world. The very qualities that make a good spy as seen here also make a man untrustworthy.Do spies ever have fun? Not much as seen from the angle of Damon's character. Dr. Fredericks Michael Gambon a randy gay pseudointellectual who turns and turns again is naughty but he pays for it. Another Brit Arch Cummings played gamely by Billy Crudup similarly wears a smile that turns to dust. A good professional of the lower ranks like Staff Sergeant Brocco John Turturro Wilson's OSS assistant in England is a stern sadist whose use of LSD for an interrogation backfires fatally. Nasty sabotages are devised to spoil the left's Latin American agricultural schemes. Big foulups like the Bay of Pigs invasion lead to vicious internal purges. And through it all Wilson's son cringes and his wife pines the marriage had dried up after his sixyear absence during WWII and his imploded selfhood is symbolized by his only hobby building ships inside bottles. As the film bluntly puts it the spymaster must choose either family or country he can't have both. And is it all worth it? The Russian on LSD declares his country's armed might a myth perpetuated by America to justify its ongoing pursuit of world dominance. Is intelligence a needed quantity or are its organizations selfperpetuating shams? The movie never gives a positive answer. This may be the cruelest picture of the spy game ever put on film.Many fine actors play small unappealing roles as spymasters or cold operatives. These include De Niro himself Alec Baldwin and William Hurt all creditable but unlikely to get Oscar nods for their tightly held back performances. Damon can be accused of the same limitation though if his Wilson bothers you he's done his job better than you may think. And young Eddie Redmayne as Wilson's grown son has one of the most gutwrenching roles in a story notable for its devastating picture of the effects of career on family life.Despite its epic scale and length it's 160 minutes long The Good Shepherd is more troubling than flashy more thoughtprovoking than moving. Ultimately it may be somewhat an artistic failure. The criticism that it is either too long or too short that it needed to be pared down or expanded to a miniseries has some merit. But nonetheless as a work that considers big issues and asks big questions it's one of the more serious and intellectually stimulating mainstream American films of the year.".

The grave tone and slow escalation of this thriller may seem like a slow burn but it's ultimately worth the fire even if it does leave you craving a bit of Hitchcockian suspense a couple of punchups from the oftmaligned Brian DePalma couldn't have hurt.

With some sharper editing the story could have been tighter and more focused early on. The more we drift away from Damon's central character the more the story wanders.

The reason this film was dubbed the Godfather of spy movies is because ala the Godfather De Niro uses real life situations involving the CIA and blends them together creating a story around the lead character played by Matt Damon. In additionseveral great performances in character parts complement Damon's performance notably Michael Gambon and John Turturro were both superb. You shouldn't view this film expecting to be blown out of your seats it is deep and requires strict attention to detail. My wife and I viewed this film in a packed movie house and we were very certain that half the people in the audience didn't understand or appreciate what they had just seen. I am not saying you need to be of great intellect to enjoy this film but one of the things De Niro manages to do is bring back a thinking man's drama that is often not seen in today's attention deficit shoot them up bang  bang movies. This film makes it obvious that Directors Bertolucci and Leone have left a huge impression on De Niro and the result is a movie that both would be proud of.".

In additionseveral great performances in character parts complement Damon's performance notably Michael Gambon and John Turturro were both superb. You shouldn't view this film expecting to be blown out of your seats it is deep and requires strict attention to detail. My wife and I viewed this film in a packed movie house and we were very certain that half the people in the audience didn't understand or appreciate what they had just seen. I am not saying you need to be of great intellect to enjoy this film but one of the things De Niro manages to do is bring back a thinking man's drama that is often not seen in today's attention deficit shoot them up bang  bang movies. This film makes it obvious that Directors Bertolucci and Leone have left a huge impression on De Niro and the result is a movie that both would be proud of.";

Expecting this I thought this movie was outstanding and a mind game from start to finish.What one has to understand about the movie itself is that it is as complicated as the storyline. It starts out with two different time lines decades apart and slowly one reaches the other. That in itself can be difficult to follow but it is well worth the effort to pay attention because if you can leave the theatre understanding what took place you walk away with a little more knowledge about the human complex.Because this is a story more about the soul and our humanity than it is about spies and country. Those are just the means by which De Niro uses.Every actor is placed remarkably well and no more so than Matt Damon himself. It is his acting that gives us Edward Wilson a man without airs who doesn't compromise. The movie spans over twenty years and fortunately we see those years reflected in most of the characters. Angelina Jolie does the neglected alcoholic wife superbly. William Hurt and Lee Pace as Richard Hayes both give a wonderful performance taking their character's flaws from subtle to substantial by the end.Some might wonder how so many actors could be recruited for such small roles like Alec Baldwin Michael Gambon and Joe Pesci but one only has to see as far as the director to get their answer. Don't let the big names and the anagram CIA get you. This movie is as edgy as it is intricate with twists and turns that take the viewer through the world of trust and the human element. A man like Edward Wilson is just the perfect vessel for the journey.".

	schema:reviewBody "The mental facility to detect conspiracies and betrayal are the same qualities most likely to corrode natural judgment. Almost every year there is one great film that slips under my radar. I usually wait for it to hit DVD because it keeps getting passed over for other films I'd rather watch. However when I finally get around to seeing it I wonder to myself how I ever let it pass me by.In 2006 that film is Robert De Niro's The Good Shepherd. Here is a cinematic gem that hits all the right notes. It is a study in detail. It is a masterclass in mood and tone and style. This movie is a fascinating character study and a riveting story of trust loyalty and betrayal  both personally and politically.Edward Wilson Matt Damon is a gifted young man whose keen intellect and sharp observational skills soon catch the attentions of some important people. While attending Yale University Edward is recruited into the ubersecretive college society known as the Skull and Bones. During the initiation ritual he is asked to recount a secret that he has never before revealed  a pledge of trust and brotherhood. He describes his father's suicide as a result of being a disgraced naval officer.The FBI becomes aware of Edward's abilities. His encounter with a poetry professor only serves to expedite his venture into the world of espionage.Edward's ties to that secretive community cost him his first love Laura a beautiful young deaf girl with a heart of gold and a pure spirit. Instead a relationship seems forced upon him with Clover Angelina Jolie sister to one of his fraternity colleagues. An unplanned pregnancy rushes along the marriage plans. It becomes a loveless relationship between strangers.The film follows Edward's life shifting between the 1940's and the 1960's counterbalancing the eager early loyalty with the paranoid lonely and resentful man he becomes later in life. The Good Shepherd is a finite analysis of a man who knows what the important things in life are family love friendship parenting but substitutes them for patriotism and duty  perhaps as a way of restoring his father's honor.What De Niro does so well is to patiently rather microscopically dissect Edward's life in the world of intelligence. Every detail of this man's soul is laid bare for us to see. It allows the viewer to respect and pity him at the same time. It is probably the greatest cinematic exploration of espionage ever made. We are privy to this character's very core.Consider the multiple virtuoso sequences in which the CIA lab technicians systematically analyze a fuzzy black  white photograph in conjunction with a low grade audio tape. It is a fascinating study in detail that serves as a microcosm to the entire movie. De Niro's legendary attention to the details of his portrayed characters has quite obviously transferred to his directing. Everything of value in The Good Shepherd lays in the subtle moments... the momentary glances... the uncomfortable silences... the verbal hints and clues.Also note the fabulous exchange in a covert London counterintelligence office between Matt Damon and John Turturro. It is a fantastic exercise in screen writing rapid rhythmic delivery and understated yet mesmerizing acting. It was wonderful to watch the Rounders duo reunite and square off with some great dialogue once again.This may be De Niro's epic creation but in terms of acting this is Matt Damon's film. What he achieves here is nothing short of... well nothing short of De Niro at his very best. Damon picks the bones of his character clean. It is a performance that establishes him as one of the greats of a generation. None of his contemporary peers can carry the face of solemnity and gravitas quite as powerfully as he. This role is Damon's Raging Bull... albeit a quiet rage. This is the best performance of 2006... from either sex.There are many fine supporting roles on display. Most noteworthy are the turns by Alec Baldwin as the allknowing FBI agent Tammy Blanchard as Edward's regrettably lost first love and Michael Gambon as the wise professor who has been in the game too long. It was also a welcome sight to see Joe Pesci in a feature film for the first time in a long while. The entire cast is first rate  an obvious sign that De Niro knows how to cast a film with actors as precise as he.This film truly captures how lonely it must be to work in the intelligence community especially at that time. Half way through the film Edward receives the news that his first son has been born. The resulting phone call to his wife is interrupted by airraid sirens and horrible static. His wife asks if he is busy saving the world. He replies Sometimes. What color are his eyes? When the line is cut off before she answers we empathize with Edward's decision to sacrifice his own happiness for the good of his ungrateful government.When Edward unexpectedly runs into Laura some years after their college romance she confesses that she often wonders what life would have been like had they stayed together. It is a poignant scene filled with regrets of what might have been.I watched two other films in the past week that were within touching distance of greatness. The Painted Veil and Goya's Ghosts were both in need of a little more patience  maybe they were afraid to go much beyond the two hour mark for fear of being commercially unviable. At two hours and fortyfive minutes The Good Shepherd goes the extra mile resulting in a complete filmgoing experience. Quite frankly it is an unassailable masterpiece.TC Candler IndependentCritics.com.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I go on to praise the good points of THE GOOD SHEPHERD I should mention at the start that the film badly needed some judicious editing. There are many scenes that go on for too long a time and are badly in need of some artful editing to get the point across just as well.Aside from length everything else about the film is on the plus sidethe handsome cinematography the vast amount of settings the background score that adds to the drama and the performances of the entire cast which are uniformly good. I'm not a great admirer of ANGELINA JOLIE as an actress but here I think she demonstrated skill at suggesting the loneliness frustrations and jealousies of a woman whose life has to remain outside the boundaries of her husband's job with the CIA. Through a series of detailed vignettes the murky world of an agent's life of deception within the government is sharply observed.More of a character study of Edward Wilson played in stolid very serious fashion by MATT DAMON than a straightforward spy yarn it manages to hold the interest even though it uses the flashback method of storytelling that is apt to confuse a viewer if it isn't done well. But here again there is a flawit covers a span of twenty or more years but the aging of the central character is never quite convincing enough. Damon never looks that much older than his grown sonwhereas a few gray hairs might have helped considerably. As his grown son EDDIE REDMAYNE does reasonably well as the man seeking his father's approval.As for the supporting players in this story about one man's experiences in the newly developing CIA JOHN TURTURRO does an outstanding job as a tough inquisitor and MICHAEL GAMBON is outstanding as a security risk with homosexual tendencies. ALEC BALDWIN has little to do but is intense enough as one of the agency's top men and others in the cast maintain credibility all the way through.The story itself is rather problematic in that nothing is what it seems and not all the information is readily given to the viewer in a way that makes sense. This is partly the fault of the script and partly the fault of director Robert De Niro who also assumes a small role effectively.But still despite the handicap of being too long and a bit too involved at certain points it makes for fascinating viewing and is the kind of film you dare not divert your attention from for a moment. If you do you are liable to miss an essential plot point.Summing up Highly recommended for anyone with a keen interest in espionage dramas.".

It has some great performances from both Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie that are likely to get some award nominations.I won't give any spoilers I'll just give my background and overall opinion. When I saw the commercials I thought it seemed interesting but not interesting enough to get me out of my seat right now to go see it. It just didn't seem to have anything totally different than other movies other than the combination of actors. Since I just got to see it anyway I realized that it's one of those movies that ends up being better than you think it would be.Matt Damon as always plays a good serious guy who's smart savvy and dedicated to his job. It kind of reminded me of his characters in The Departed and the Bourne Identity except it's in a different situation and setting. His performance in this role was very fitting and believable.Angelina Jolie surprisingly worked well with this role. In the commercials I thought she was a little too wild compared to Matt Damon's calm character but she really brought out the emotion of a wife who felt shut out and didn't have a complete relationship with and understanding of her husband.Robert DeNiro of course was great. It was a nicely added touch to an already good movie.While I wouldn't say it's as factual as the History Channel I think the subject of the movie does put good insight on the history of the CIA. I think people who are into governmentpolitics and history would like the storyline. It does focus quite a bit on his family relationship and how it is affected by his job in the CIA and I'm sure any couple who has been in a similar situation would understand it.Overall the movie was better than I thought and I would recommend it to moviegoers especially those who like suspense and any of the main characters.".

	schema:headline " Disappointing";
	schema:reviewBody "I went in this one really wanting to like it. What an incredible concept! But the film just didn't do a thing for me.Firstly I find it hard to suspend my disbelief to buy Matt Damon as a 20 yearold college junior. He was just plain old 34 yearold Matt. THEN six years later he has a son and talks to him on overseas long distance and Matt looks exactly the same except he has changed his eyeglass frames...he is supposed 26 yet still looks 34. THEN fifteen years later Matt has changed his eyeglass frames again but now his son is 20 yearsold and Matt is STILL only 34. When these two are together as father and son it just kills any other aspect of what the story is attempting to tell us because NO ONE can buy into Matt Damon's son only being 14 years younger than himself.The least DeNiro could have done was to put a little grey hair at Matt's temples or buy him a different suit of clothes. In a film full of flashbacks covering a 22 year period it is vital to make your characters age and progress through life.Oh yeah I absolutely COULD NOT buy Angelina Jolie as a 20 yearold debutante. And the most frequent comment I heard in the lobby following the film was observations about Matt and Angelina's gay son with the deformed giant upper lip...very distracting and horrible casting on the grown son actor.But putting the casting aside the thread that unites the tale into a whole and pulls along to the conclusion of the story is totally nonexistent. Sure I saw some of the old fabled myths of CIA lore stabbed at rather listlessly like the LSD25 scene. Actually the LSD suicide via window jumping was supposedly a CIA agent and not a Soviet operative. And the whole planting of locusts in South America by the CIA in order to foil the Zapatistas politicoeconomic strategy has pretty much been discredited over the years. But this IS after all a fanciful telling of a single person's vantage of the period so I guess it is not that important.But there were incredibly disjointed scenes that did nothing for the story and barely did anything for character development. For instance Joe Pesci appearing for several minutes of noncontributing story points just so Matt Damon's character can say America the rest of you are just visiting was a waste of time and illuminated nothing about Cuba the Mob or the CIA's relationship with the Mob. Or why is Matt's son in Africa hooking up with black girls? Is Matt's son supposed to be a CIA agent at that point? Is he giving up dirty tricks to the other side? What did he do with the information he overheard in the bath tub? Was he still just a college boy? You really cannot nail down time periods regarding the son because he ages even less than his parents once he becomes an adult.And a most irritating bit of prop management is it appears that Matt Damon's character wore the same trench coat and hat from 1939 to 1961. I am sure they were of the highest quality but I just don't see these items being worn every single business day for over twenty years and still looking serviceable.Like I said I really wanted to enjoy this movie but after three hours of my life sitting there waiting for the big reveal it just ended. I cannot recommend this one to friends unless they are willing to wait for DVD rental or better yet HBO release. Sorry.".

	onyx:emotionText "I went in this one really wanting to like it. What an incredible concept! But the film just didn't do a thing for me.Firstly I find it hard to suspend my disbelief to buy Matt Damon as a 20 yearold college junior. He was just plain old 34 yearold Matt. THEN six years later he has a son and talks to him on overseas long distance and Matt looks exactly the same except he has changed his eyeglass frames...he is supposed 26 yet still looks 34. THEN fifteen years later Matt has changed his eyeglass frames again but now his son is 20 yearsold and Matt is STILL only 34. When these two are together as father and son it just kills any other aspect of what the story is attempting to tell us because NO ONE can buy into Matt Damon's son only being 14 years younger than himself.The least DeNiro could have done was to put a little grey hair at Matt's temples or buy him a different suit of clothes. In a film full of flashbacks covering a 22 year period it is vital to make your characters age and progress through life.Oh yeah I absolutely COULD NOT buy Angelina Jolie as a 20 yearold debutante. And the most frequent comment I heard in the lobby following the film was observations about Matt and Angelina's gay son with the deformed giant upper lip...very distracting and horrible casting on the grown son actor.But putting the casting aside the thread that unites the tale into a whole and pulls along to the conclusion of the story is totally nonexistent. Sure I saw some of the old fabled myths of CIA lore stabbed at rather listlessly like the LSD25 scene. Actually the LSD suicide via window jumping was supposedly a CIA agent and not a Soviet operative. And the whole planting of locusts in South America by the CIA in order to foil the Zapatistas politicoeconomic strategy has pretty much been discredited over the years. But this IS after all a fanciful telling of a single person's vantage of the period so I guess it is not that important.But there were incredibly disjointed scenes that did nothing for the story and barely did anything for character development. For instance Joe Pesci appearing for several minutes of noncontributing story points just so Matt Damon's character can say America the rest of you are just visiting was a waste of time and illuminated nothing about Cuba the Mob or the CIA's relationship with the Mob. Or why is Matt's son in Africa hooking up with black girls? Is Matt's son supposed to be a CIA agent at that point? Is he giving up dirty tricks to the other side? What did he do with the information he overheard in the bath tub? Was he still just a college boy?

	schema:reviewBody "I had a huge advantage before watching this on DVD. I was told by a good friend that it was extremely slow and be prepared to be bored out of my mind. Well I wasn't bored maybe because I now expected a slower nonactionpacked CIAtype film....and I wasn't disappointed. Actually I liked it mainly because of the cinematography. This is stunning in its photography. Kudos to Director Robert De Niro and Director of Photography Robert Richardson for their work in here.I also appreciated the low profanity in here. After watching The Departed this farcleaner film was a treat for the ears too. Yes there are a handful of 'fwords but not much else including no blasphemy.But I agree that this is a very slow film and it helps to know that in advance. It's also one you have to follow closely and time periods shift back and forth mainly from 1961 back to the early 1940s. The story winds up presenting an interesting question which is posed to Matt Damon's character Edward Wilson. He plays an extremely loyal CIA man a guy who is straightarrow and one whose priority is countryfirst. The dilemma occurs at the end when he must choose between what's best for his son or his country. It's a thoughtout interesting story that takes a few sides to the left of center more than the right but is not really a movie with any heavyhanded political agenda mainly pointing out what it takes to be a successful spy and that this unemotional detachment can be rough on some people and their families.Damon heads an allstar cast that includes Angeline Jolie who looks spectacular as a woman in the early 1940s Billy Crudup Alec Baldwin William Hurt Timothy Hutton and many others.This movie I suspect will either put you to sleep or fascinate you.".

	schema:headline " A Bloated Boring and unfortunately disappointing movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "I wanted to like it I really did. I bought my ticket for The Good Shepard solely based on a few trailers I saw in the fall....Damon DeNiro Pesci Jolie...spies the CIA THE COLD WAR!!!!...this had to be good or so I thought. Unfortunately in one of the worst editing jobs I've ever seen DeNiro lets this movie meander into a dismal abyss where the viewer begins to foretell the scenes and even the conclusion well before they happen. First off I must clear up a clear advertising ploy performed by the production house. This is not a movie about the birth of the CIA its a biopic about a fictional character named Edward Wilson Damon loosely based on the life of the real CIA founder James Jesus Angleton. The trailers which make you excited to see Damon Pesci DeNiro and Jolie share the screen are a fraud. Pesci has about a 3minute cameo as a mob boss and DeNiro stumbles figuratively and literally through 3 or 4 scenes as an Army general who recruits Damon and then guides him as the growth of counter intelligence and the Cold War occur simultaneously. Jolie plays second fiddle to Damon the entire movie. She holds her own at times but the script more or less requires her to crawl into the shell of a marriage and life that her husband Damon makes for her. Its not a poor acting performance but we are so used to seeing Jolie take over movies that its almost painful to watch her hide behind Damon. Onto the film  Damon is excellent and he draws fine supporting roles out of John Turturro and Micheal Gambon. The acting is the only saving grace of this movie. Im sure positive reviewers will touch open Damon's ability to hold the screen for 3 hours and I concur he gives a strong performance as a man who is perhaps misunderstood perhaps sheltered within his own moralism but ultimately boring. The life he partially chooses and is partially forced to chose is one of a supposed higher purpose and patriotism. The birth of the CIA is manifested by Wilson's ability to choose this patriotic life and remain true to it in the face of serious conflicting decisions related to his friends family and overall morality. Some may call it stoicism but Damon's portrayal of Wilson which is intentionally designed to be wooden and singularly devoted to his career sinks this movie. Its not that its not believable its that its just not interesting. Wilson's personality is so obvious that the plot never takes on any intrigue because Wilson never waivers from his objectives and thus the plot lines become very predictable. The first 45 minutes take you through the Yale years the impregnation of Jolie and Damon's stint as an intelligence officer in Britain during WWII. So far so good but already you can see the developing themes Damon  Jolie  the fraud of a marriage Damon and Gambon who serves as a his mentor  internal betrayal and the choice between protecting those close to you and serving the interests of the United States government. The scenes that dominate the middle of this movie are not fluid and failed to perk my interest in the plot. People are promoted but the viewer does not know why people move to the Congo but the viewer does not know why people become turncoats but no reason is given for their betrayals instead you accept them as fact hope for it all to tie in and are disappointed when answers either fail to emerge or are predictable when they do. In the end the movie is disconnected. There is nothing left to hang your hat on. No great espionage scenes no cinematic contributions to the spy genre as one may have thought and very little if any historically significant commentary on what we all know is a time period and subject matter that lends itself to compelling theater. Within the development of the CIA you see the fact that no one trusts anyone but you only see brief snippets of true betrayal or worse yet the betrayals you do see can be forecast 1 hour before they happen. DeNiro has a bad habit of introducing an obvious problem into the plot covering the problem up with 45 minutes of filler and then letting it resurface  so you say to yourself I forgot about that but I saw it coming. Its no way to make a successful movie. So with the CIA development and spy stories lacking in all respects the movie turns back to the family and beats this plot line down over and over again until you just want Jolie to throw herself out of a window much like some other people in the film and save both herself and the viewers the pain of watching the family continually devolve. In the end some choices must be made but any halfminded viewer knows what will happen long before it does. Sure you can argue that there are a few twists but after almost three hours I was to numbed by sheer boredom to give much credit to any final hour plot twists. This is a boring movie directed poorly and acted wonderfully. Save it for a night with the girlfriend or wife when you want to fall asleep in each other's arms at home cause if anything it will serve as a good sleeping agent.".

Sometimes we're lucky enough to get a TV image of President Kennedy in the Cuban Missle Crisis to know that we've suddenly entered the timewarp from the 1940s to 1961. Other times there is no such clue such as a jump of probably a few hours or days such as when a perfidious German woman assistant gets her just reward. We don't know whether to dispatch those assassins with silencers on their pistols after the screenplay writer or the film editor.The scope of the film while seeming grand at first as it sweeps quarter century turns out to be rather microcosmic with a series of vignettes instead of a unified story line. The focus remains mainly on the effect of the cloak and dagger on one man Edward Wilson Sr. and his wife and son and the conflict of loyalties to country and family. Since the account is fictionalized history we're not sure what to accept as biography and history as we watch the homoerotic crossdressing elite WASPy Yale camaraderie turn into boys playing with big toys and geopolitics. Wilson apparently pattered after James Jesus Angleton is bred to elitism and public service from childhood and matriculates to Yale in the late 1930s to make the necessary career connections.The good shepherd lays down his life for his flock according to a parable of Jesus. After Allies win World War II wartime intelligence among them the fictional Wilson and his classmates continue their work as shepherds to keep the Free World free or at least a reasonable facsimile.Central Intelligence Agency consumes their lives as did their Yale secret society Skull and Bones which reportedly has the loyalties of Presidents Bush 41 and 43 and Sen. John Kerry among other government and business leaders. Why isn't the used with the name of the agency? We're told it is because the isn't used for God either.The film is nonetheless interesting for its strong acting by the studied taciturnity of Matt Damon and the effete professor Michael Gambon with a secret life. The ethnic portrayals add some color to the white bread. Director Robert DeNiro mugs in a role reminiscent of Wild Bill Donovan a lone Catholic wary of recruiting others for agency. Joe Pesci is what else? the Italian mobster in Florida. John Tuturro is the streetsmart Italian army sergeant Ray Brocco who follows Wilson to the CIA to bruise his knuckles as an interrogator. Angela Jolie transforms from a lusty patrician daughter looking for husband material among her brother's Yalie classmates to a longsuffering wife in pearls. Alec Baldwin is the ubiquitous Gman in trenchcost.There are a number of lesserknown actors in the ensemble who were superb like Laura Tammy Blanchard the deaf woman at Yale who is the only one who brings out love from Edward Wilson Sr. Mark Ivanir and John Sessions as dueling defectors were especially memorable as was Oleg Stefan as Wilson's Soviet counterpart.".

After Allies win World War II wartime intelligence among them the fictional Wilson and his classmates continue their work as shepherds to keep the Free World free or at least a reasonable facsimile.Central Intelligence Agency consumes their lives as did their Yale secret society Skull and Bones which reportedly has the loyalties of Presidents Bush 41 and 43 and Sen. John Kerry among other government and business leaders. Why isn't the used with the name of the agency? We're told it is because the isn't used for God either.The film is nonetheless interesting for its strong acting by the studied taciturnity of Matt Damon and the effete professor Michael Gambon with a secret life. The ethnic portrayals add some color to the white bread. Director Robert DeNiro mugs in a role reminiscent of Wild Bill Donovan a lone Catholic wary of recruiting others for agency. Joe Pesci is what else? the Italian mobster in Florida. John Tuturro is the streetsmart Italian army sergeant Ray Brocco who follows Wilson to the CIA to bruise his knuckles as an interrogator. Angela Jolie transforms from a lusty patrician daughter looking for husband material among her brother's Yalie classmates to a longsuffering wife in pearls. Alec Baldwin is the ubiquitous Gman in trenchcost.There are a number of lesserknown actors in the ensemble who were superb like Laura Tammy Blanchard the deaf woman at Yale who is the only one who brings out love from Edward Wilson Sr. Mark Ivanir and John Sessions as dueling defectors were especially memorable as was Oleg Stefan as Wilson's Soviet counterpart.";

	schema:reviewBody "A sincere congratulations to the filmmakers who wove this intricate deceit and an even sincerer kudos to the few who were able not only to remain in their seats but also to appreciate the latent hues of what appeared to many a sterilely colored film.Any discussion of The Good Shepherd's brilliant elements must begin with Matt Damon's rendition of Edward Wilson a Cold War era CIA agent ostensibly dehumanized by the tediously executed yet crushingly weighty protocol his career demands. Though his calculated veneer seems overly flat through the first portion of this lengthy film take the almost unrealistically miniscule evidence of aging and his paucity of emotion the subtleties of his character accumulate as the yawns around a transfixed viewer become more audible.Speaking in generalities Wilson's is the story of a brilliant intellect suffocated by its acquiescence to a supposedly greater good. Anecdotally consider a scene placed so early within the three hours as to have likely rendered it unremarkable in the memories of most viewers. During his initiation into a certain influential society of those whose country the rest of us are just visiting Damon's character objects to the degradation of finding himself at the receiving end of a senior member's urine. His brief unwillingness to surrender dignity in the name of subservience to an ethos or the entity representing it plants a seed in the mind of the attentive viewer that furtively blossoms throughout the rest of the film in the form of a repressed individuality that belies his increasingly mechanical visage. This is not the story of a bland civil servant but rather a tale of the manner in which civil servitude can strip even a New Haven poet of his human vitality.Yet another moment lost perhaps amidst the interwoven timeline that speaks volumes as to the principal character's internal strife comes amidst the rubble of a newly divided Berlin. A stillyoung Agent Wilson quips that his superior's weakness may not be the chocolate his mother bestowed upon him but rather the eagerness for approval that such systems of reward engender. This insight proves incisive with regard to Damon's character as he meets each request made of him throughout the remainder of the film with would it please you? Despite nary a camera delving into the inner workings of the KGB one cinematographic cue during a scene that even the film's critics laud speaks to the universality of the plight suffered by the cogs of inhuman and inhumane governmental locomotion. As Agent Brocco beats tortures and strips nude a Soviet operative the CIA suspects to be a mole one cannot help but notice the striking resemblance between John Turturro and the man he is waylaying as their faces mirror one another at close range for several moments. Even before the audience learns that this tragic figure was indeed telling the truth to his interrogators it waxes ironic that doppelgangers in both appearance and dedication to national service drive one another to the film's most heinously graphic deeds.My only regret is that in the Berlin scene between Wilson and his sweettoothed mentor an unnecessary reference to the parallel hearts and minds campaigns of the postWorld War II and modern eras was inserted to render an already abundantly topical film more evidently so. The pervasiveness of federal agency grown too lumberingly methodical to maintain its consonance with the civilization it was intended to safeguard should be at the fore of most American's minds. Catastrophically the ubiquity of minds unwilling to pierce the veil of bureaucratic docility that guises this film's dehumanizing core leaves little hope that the moviegoercitizen can decipher the patronizing platitudes of the modern political idiom.Thank you Mr. De Niro for making us think.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Good Shepherd is my second best film of 2006. A lot of people who have seen it will think differently and I can understand that. This film is not for everyone but the viewers who have a love for US History The Cold War CIA Espionage or Spy films should be pleased with The Good Shepherd. It is very subtle but extremely effective. The Good Shepherd is told from a series of flashbacks during a two week mission to find the significance of a document that was sent to the house of Edward Wilson by an anonymous persons. We see the rise of Edward Wilson Matt Damon from his ranks as a Skull and Bones member to the head of the Counter Intelligence section of CIA.Robert De Niro directs this epic nearmasterpiece of the creation of CIA through one mans eyes Edward Wilson. Matt Damon gives a great performance and one of his best along with The Departed and Good Will Hunting. Damon plays Edward Wilson who starts off as a Yale graduate and Skull and Bones member. He is recruited by an FBI Agent Alec Baldwin to spy on his poetry professor Dr. Fredrick's Michael Gambon who is believed to have set up a Nazi organization and is enlisting students and faculty members. Edward agrees to spy on his professor after some talking into and gets the names of the people Dr. Fredrick's has enlisted which leads to his firing on the basis of his political beliefs.On Deer Island Skull and Bones retreat he meets Margaret Clover Russell Angelina Jolie who seeks out Edward immediately and finds something about him quite intriguing. Matt Damon plays the man made out of stone giving little to no emotional reaction to anything and just about everything. Edward Wilson is a man of few words but he chooses wisely what few words he speaks.Edward Wilson falls in love with Laura played wonderfully by Tammy Blanchard a deaf women but their relationship comes to an abrupt end as Edward finds that Margaret has become pregnant with his child and Edward is to do what is expected of him. This means he will have to leave Laura and marry Clover. A week after their marriage Edward has to go overseas during WWII mostly working out of Germany but is sent to London and joins the OSS Office of Strategic Services by General Bill Sullivan Robert De Niro.After the war Germany is crumbling and Edward Wilson is climbing the ranks garnering more and more trust. The Soviets are now looking to acquire as many scientists as possible. In Berlin Edward Wilson meets his adversary codename Ulysses and the back and forth battle between Wilson His codename is Mother and Ulysses is something to really behold and some of the best scenes in the film take part during their back and forth battle of disinformation and counter intelligence and deception and infiltration of spies sent into one another's operations and then each adversary takes out these spies then sends the message that these spies were found and disposed of. Was that confusing? Neither seems to gain much of any ground on each other until the end of the film where Ulysses sends a spy into Wilson's Agency and get's valuable information from someone very close to Edward Wilson. This information ruins the Bay of Pigs invasion which turns out to be a costly loss and damaging defeat. Wilson has to make a tough decision between his family and his country.Edward Wilson was a man of selflessness who put his entire life into his country and did what he could do with his son. He makes sacrifices for his country and for his son. He sacrifices his time and relationship with his family for his country. He sacrifices his true love with Laura and marries Margaret for his son. If you were going to sum up Edward Wilson it probably would be best to use the term selfless. Everything he does is for his country and the future of it. We never see him do much of anything for his own personal joy. This kind of behavior leads to a marriage that crumbles and falls apart. He plays the protector and is forced to do things such as have people killed and interrogated for the greater good. All over an idea Communism. I loved it. It may take a few viewings to fully understand the complexities of this film but it is well worth it and an intense film with some great action and conversation throughout the film. 9.710".

	schema:reviewBody "Coupla things no pun on FrancisFord intended about this movie. spoilersbelow First some minor details that bugged methings that really violated what I consider to be reasonable dramatic license in plot lines or scenes not in order of seriousness 1. The photos of Wilson in the cab during his brief affair with the deaf woman. That fling was a completely spontaneous thing and his meetings with the Ulysses guy after which that fling followed would have been scheduled in utter secrecy. So how would someone have been following him to get these photos? Even if it were the Russianswho would have known of the meeting through Ulyssesthey would have gained little or nothing from trying to meddle in his personal dealings with his wife. They're not after that kind of dirt on him and risking blowing their cover by giving her the photos would be like the FBI blowing their cover on a yearslong sting operation by giving their quarry a traffic ticket. It made no sense. And Angelina Jolie's character wouldn't have had him followedfirst I don't think she really cared that much and besideshe's the top spyhe wouldn't have been found out by some secondrate privateeye.2. Her Angelina Jolie's reaction to his affair was way way out of line with her character. She'd already admitted she had an affair and he was basically an absentee husband and father they both knew the marriage was utterly baseless. So why would she be so upset? She said she was 'humiliated'. How? Nobody else knew about the photos but her. Why make a scene like she didthat's the only thing that humiliated her.3. The thing with the son and that girl was so far out of sync with any reality that it really ruined the whole movie for me. First I'd guessed it at the moment his son asked to join the CIA. And that was really the central part of the moviefrom beginning to end they were trying to figure out the tape and the sounds and all that. Back then a transatlantic loveaffair in the Congo would have been exceedingly difficult to both conduct and especially hideeven from an absentee father. There were several other things that were out of bounds but once a movie oversteps that 'dramatic license' boundary once or twice the rest don't matterthe movie is ruined. Also this movie broke rule 1 in my opinion For a movie to be really likable you need to have a central character that you either like understand or can at least relate to in some way or another. Wilson was like a piece of cardboard. Like the one line said There can't be two of you. Finally for this to be interesting I think you'd have to have some prior knowledge on the subject ie have read at least a book or two on it to catch andor follow some of the highly enigmatic dialog. I've read several nonfiction works on this as well as some 'based on fact' fiction books and fortunately some of the subject matter was familiar and semiinteresting. But this movie couldn't make up it's mind as to whether it wanted to be a 'based on fact' fictional movie or a pure fantasy fiction piece. It mixed them and therefore sold itself short on each one.Jim".

The plot is intricate and keeps throwing twists and turns throughout the film. In addition this film has singlehandedly changed my opinion of Matt Damon. He was absolutely excellent in this thrilling drama and in my opinion is worthy of an Oscar nomination as is most of the cast. Robert De Niro showed absolute mastery in his direction of Eric Roth's screenplay and the whole quality of the experience truly reminded me of such epic classics as The Godfather. The Good Shepherd is long in duration but keeps you on the edge making the time fly. Plus the movie is truly starstudded with many of the supporting roles played by Hollywood Heavyweights. If you love dramas political espionage or just an excellent characterdriven film the depth that De Niro gives these characters is amazing you will LOVE this movie! Thank you Mr. De Niro for restoring my faith in movies. DEFINITE Oscar CONTENDER!".

	schema:reviewBody "CONTAINS SPOILERS! I went to an advanced screening last night. I honestly was kind of dreading it. While I am a big fan of the actors the long run time and the negative reviews I read had me prepared for a boring 3 hours. Thankfully I was wrong. The pace of the movie was deliberate but not slow. There were no actual action scenes but I still found it very suspenseful. I was guessing about everyones loyalties right up until the very end. I thought Matt Damon played the part wonderfully. His performance was very deliberate. He spoke very little but I was just as interested in what he didn't say. The movie does move around from the present 1961 to the main characters past beginning with his college career at Yale frequently. I thought it was done very tastefully. I never had a problem understanding what time the movie was in. There were captions to show the location and date and it flowed very well.I thought that Matt and Angelina did very well in their parts as a married couple. They weren't supposed to steam up the screen. They had a one night stand she got pregnant and he did the honorable thing by marrying her. They weren't in love and if she hadn't gotten pregnant they would never have married each other. I'm trying to respond to a lot of the negative reviews I read about the movie. From some of them I don't think people even saw the movie but only commented on previews. As far as negative aspects of the movie I can only think of one. I did not like Matt and Angelina's college age son. I thought his acting was over the top and I cringed every time he was on screen. He did look a lot like Matt though. I thought it was a great movie and I highly recommend it. I am going to go again when it is released. I'm sure I missed something it was full of so much intrigue. I also have a few questions I haven't been able to figure out yet.".

	schema:reviewBody "Men like Edward Wilson Matt Damon select a path of life set apart from society so those living in the fold of our free system can do so completely unaware of the man who holds the Sheperd's crook. Edward is a true patriot. The safety of the United States and it's citizens are in his hands. The elements of The Good Shepard are the life experiences of Edward and how after accepting a commission from U. S. Army Intelligence on the day of his nuptials separates the young couple for the next six years. The bespectacled face of Edward Wilson hides the stone cold calculating heart of a man who knows he will come home from the war. He returns to a wife who does not love him and a five year old son who does not know him. The C.I.A. is the perfect government agency for Edward to continue his protecting of the flock. The sequencing of the film is in itself a story about many secrets and who can be trusted with these secrets. Edward's right hand man Ray Bucco John Tuturro throughout the entire film gives a stunning performance well worth a nod for a recommendation for a Best Supporting Oscar. As The Good Shepard draws towards a close the audience remembers that this was a period piece from the late 1920's through the mid 1960's and as Edward disappears into C.I.A. Headquarters one can only think of the next bespectacled Sheperd taking his place.".
