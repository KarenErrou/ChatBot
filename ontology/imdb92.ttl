	schema:reviewBody "A rare and masterful adaptation of a piercing psychological stage drama. An emotionally unstable young man trying to come to terms with his love and erotic attraction as well as religious like worship of  horses. Absolutely gripping!I remember when I saw this on stage reading in the program that the writer Peter Schafer was traveling through the English countryside when he happened to come across a local news story of a young man who had blinded 6 horses at a nearby stable. Hence the basis for this story. So in a way it's a true one with the details behind the event being Schafer's invention. Something in itself quite remarkable. It's hard to image someone taking that bit of information and fabricating anything more probing or riveting than this. This work takes full advantage of the possibilities of the screen yet retains the intimate feel of a play. Especially effective are Richard Burton's monologues directed to the viewer with enough food for thought to last through many a viewing. Also thought provoking are his conversations with a female colleague about his experience with this emotionally disturbed young man. The way nudity is handled in this film is also a rare pleasure. Unashamedly presented in all it's natural beauty both male and female. Most films seem to act like male nudity is just too shocking for us to handle.It's curious to me that a number of reviews that I've read by  professional critic's seem to have been made too uncomfortable with the depth and intensity of this film to give it the top rating that it deserves. Few films have dared be this bold yet simple in it's natural telling of a highly unusual act of violence by a young man emotionally out of control and all the darkness that lie beneath.Also interesting is a story such as this where the therapy and healing taking place seems to be shared equally by patient and doctor. No other film has played that angle with the understanding of Equus.It's a shame this film is so under appreciated. It should easily be in the top 250 and quite possibly the top 100 of all time. The fact it has only 233 votes at Imdb is evidence of it's undeserved obscurity.Rent this when your ready for something profound and unforgettable.".

	schema:headline " Superb Film on its Own Different Terms";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the most intriguing comments I've heard about this film is that it pales in comparison to the stage production.  On the one hand this is true in that the film loses much of the inventive staging that was inherent in the play e.g. convention of having the horses played by actors in black with horsehead headdresses the tight focus of the action within a small perimeter.  The problem however isn't so much Sidney Lumet's concept of the film as it is the limitations of the medium itself  devices which are striking on stage simply don't work on film.  Indeed those directors who have tried to make such conventions work usually end up shortchanging the material.And it is here where Lumet's genius comes in.  If there is one thing that Lumet has a feel for it is the gritty downtoearth feel of everyday life. While this usually means New York life he does a marvelous job in this film of capturing the drab sterility of Dysart's world as well as that of the Strang home.  When these are compared to the vivid almost ethereal shots of Alan in the stables or with the horses on the field also compare the striking image of horse and rider on the beach with the remainder of the beachgoers we can fully understand Dysart's frustration about looking at pages of centaurs trampling the soil of Argos while Alan is trying to become one in a Hampshire field.  Alan has found a way to completely escape the drabness of his world while Dysart has become sterile trying to find ways not remind himself of it.  Similarly the tight perimeter of the stage play has been replaced by tight focused shots which more often than not achieve the same result through a claustrophobic effect.Likewise the absence of theatrical staging does nothing to dampen the power of Shaffer's text which remains as potent as ever.  Indeed what's often overlooked about this play is that while the visual images of the staging are striking they are in most instances completely detached from the central thrust of the text both as a mystery and as a commentary on the consequences of society's demand for normality at any cost.In this regard the performances are outstanding.  Richard Burton gives one of his last great performances as Dysart showing us the literally crumbling facade of the doctor's spirit while at the same time giving us a complete character contrast his cynicism throughout with the moments of tenderness such as those shown to Alan's mother and to Alan himself after the final session.  Likewise Peter Firth presents us with a cipher wrapped up in television jingles who is revealed to us piece by piece through moments of vulnerability until we see in full force what has made his character commit these horrible crimes.  The rest of the cast  notably Joan Plowright Colin Blakely and Jenny Agutter  do wonders with the limited dialogue they have to work with.Put simply Equus is an astonishing film to watch provided that you're ready to watch it as a film rather than as a filmed stage play.  For those who hold to the notion that only the stage devices can make this play work I'd advise them not to watch any film adapted from a play as they'll almost certainly be disappointed every time.".

	schema:headline " When Horror Meets Reality";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is one of the most disturbing yet moving and deep movies I have ever seen. This movie in fact is not thought of as a horror movie but it surly could be considered one. It does not do what 99 of all horror movies do which is make you fearful of what might come out of the wall or make you jump out of your chair. Instead it haunts you psychologically in a way I have and probably most people have not seen in a movie. It makes you fearful of the truth. It makes you fearful of yourself and what your mind could do to you. How you could so easily get attached to something that it becomes obsessive and the only way to let go of that attachment is by hurting or destroying it or the idea of it. It is just so hard to describe what the message is in here because of how shocking and frightening it is. That is at least my interpretation of one of the most deep and meaningful movies I have seen. You know the movie is telling you something but you can't quite figure it out. Maybe you don't want to figure it out.What helped bring this film to such a level was the The acting by Richard Burton and Peter Firth. Richard Burton gives one the top five performances of his career playing an experienced psychologist who has a new patient. That new patient is Peter Firth who plays a horse loving teenager who suddenly blinds six horses. Peter Firth and Richard Burton combined to give one of the most haunting and disturbing duo performances ever getting deep inside the mind of and thinking of the human being. Burton was so haunting with that look in his eyes when he plays crazy. He is one of the most underrated actors in terms of playing chilling and frightening performances. He could probably play Hannibal Lechter. Peter Firth to me was robbed of the Oscar losing to Jason Robards who played barely 10 minutes in Julia. Lets not make this into a an Oscar snub rant though. The truly haunting part about the acting is the effect that Firth's character has on the Burton's character who starts to envy him. At that point of the film I got more freaked out than ever have before but trust me there is plenty more that Firth and Burton do that will shock like you have never before. The directing was superb. Sidney Lumet really shows here that he can do more than courtroom dramas. This is one of the best directed movies ever. In order for a movie to be so deep and so frightening the directing has to be great. Here Sidney Lumet proves once again why he is such a creative and great director. This is one of Lumet's best movies. This comes together with the cinematography and writing that really makes you feel the schizophreniccraziness come over you.This movie seems like it could be shown in many college classes or something of a high academic level. It really can be dissected in so many ways. The relationships of people and how they develop. The type of effect they can have on people and when can you truly say you have had a meaningful life or have really experienced life. For example lines like this That's what his stare has been saying to me all this time 'At least I galloped  when did you?' With lines like this you will question yourself and your experiences. Even worse maybe the people defined as crazy are not crazy but instead maybe you are In short what is truly normal or sane? Tough questions and statements that have been brought about by this movies that really brings this movie such a level that most movies and books can't reach in terms of maturity and meaning.My advice would be too watch this film but you need to be at a mature level going into watch it. This is not your ordinary film it is horrific at a deep level which does not come about too often in movies. Some scenes maybe freaky and psychologically frightening but if you watch this you will certain wonder about yourself and what goes on in your mind. Trust me you will definitely get something out of this.One line that can describe one of the many themes in this movie is In my mouth lies this sharp chain and it never comes out".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film several times as a teenager. It meant a lot to me and altered many of the concrete ideas I was trying to understand. Its a shame this film is not more widely available and better known. Its filled with brilliant performances and a shattering script by Peter Schaffer.It is hard not to be shaken  and stirred by the ideas of this filmplay. It is a powerful indictment of the complexity of the human mind and the limits of science in attempting to translate understand and reform the wild and fantastic reaches of human consciousness. It is a film with so many subtexts and ideas about the human mind  it encompasses questions of religion psychiatry dreams forbidden sexuality fantasy taboos psychology youth and history. Well these are the most crucial in the films narrative.Equus tells the story of a adolescent's counselling after he commits a violent extreme crime. Alan Strang Peter Firth has been interned under the guidance of Martin Dysart Richard Burton to work through the issues surrounding his actions. Alan is clearly disturbed and withdrawn but the devastating secrets he bears threaten not merely his own family but Dysart's own sense of self and truth.

	onyx:emotionText "I watched this film several times as a teenager. It meant a lot to me and altered many of the concrete ideas I was trying to understand. Its a shame this film is not more widely available and better known. Its filled with brilliant performances and a shattering script by Peter Schaffer.It is hard not to be shaken  and stirred by the ideas of this filmplay. It is a powerful indictment of the complexity of the human mind and the limits of science in attempting to translate understand and reform the wild and fantastic reaches of human consciousness. It is a film with so many subtexts and ideas about the human mind  it encompasses questions of religion psychiatry dreams forbidden sexuality fantasy taboos psychology youth and history. Well these are the most crucial in the films narrative.Equus tells the story of a adolescent's counselling after he commits a violent extreme crime. Alan Strang Peter Firth has been interned under the guidance of Martin Dysart Richard Burton to work through the issues surrounding his actions. Alan is clearly disturbed and withdrawn but the devastating secrets he bears threaten not merely his own family but Dysart's own sense of self and truth. And audiences too.Its a film noted for its male nudity  which is quite notable  but its the swirling subversive ideas which spring forth from this film which make it even more challenging and provocative. An important intelligent film.";

	schema:reviewBody "All right! The normal is the good smile in a child's eyes. There's also the dead stare in a million adults. It both sustains and kills like a god. It is the ordinary made beautiful it is also the average made lethal. Normal is the indispensable murderous god of health and I am his priest. Richard Burton's last truly great performance came in Sidney Lumet's screen adaption of Paul Shaffer's play reprising the celebrated role that he himself had already wowed critics with on stage. When a disturbed young man Alan Strang Peter Firth blinds six horses with a metal spike he is referred by the magistrates to the care of psychiatrist Dr. Martin Dysart Burton. Determined to unravel the mind of his patient and discover the trigger for this most brutal act Dysart slowly forges a bond with the youth unearthing fragment by fragment a childhood shaped of sexual repression religious confusion maternal overload and of course a burning equine obsession. However as Dysart plunges deeper and deeper into Strangs psyche he not only begins to question his own professional merit but begins to envy the World of passion and fantasy that the youth has retreated into. Highly regarded for his character driven films Equus is up there amongst Sidney Lumets very best. The script is extremely intelligent whilst there are a handful of small but eyecatching supporting roles that help Dysart slot the pieces of his puzzle together most notably from Colin Blakely and Joan Plowright as Strangs parents and Jenny Agutter as the young girl who introduces Alan to the stables where his madness finally spirals into violence. There are also some evocative flashback sequences throughout that are impressively disturbing and yet at the same time succeed in capturing the wonder and beauty of Strangs obsession. However the film really stands as a two hander between the brooding Burton and the revelatory Peter Firth a relationship that is light years more nuanced and evolved than the somewhat softcentred dynamic between Robin Williams and Matt Damon in the similarly themed Good Will Hunting. Firth turns in a wonderfully sensitive performance as the shy deeply damaged youth who is overwhelmed by his adolescence repressed yearnings and befuddled sexuality whilst Burton is absolutely terrific as Dysart his disillusionment with his own sterile existence and unhappy marriage diffusing slowly through his sexually muted conversations with his friend Eileen Atkins and spilling out in a string of acidic monologues that both narrate events and serve as vents to the emotional conflicts of a man whose career is devoted to unravelling them. It's a most eloquent and rewarding performance in an eloquent and rewarding film. Equus is a film that asks no easy questions and offers no easy moral judgements. It is a mature articulate and bruising character study that demands to be seen.".

Lummet is one of the greatest and underrated directors of all time. Why? He extracts awesome acting from his actors and he's got a choice for stories.Equus is my best Lummet film I have seen so far  I always had a tendency to take interest on and see subtext in extreme weird negative situations on film. You have much to take from negative stuff if they're handled properly. Here there are so much stated for the viewer to think. Questions on the point of psychotherapy on the nature of perversion and its possible causes importance of religion combined with lack of knowledge isolation lust for life and so much more I don't want to refer to here. Beware! The film features strong material  both visuals and texts  this is no easy film for Hollywood audience. But its not uneasy in a way that it's slow or 'arty' or anything. Far from that it's original deeply involving with gripping atmosphere... Its subject matter though might force the more coward or less openminded viewers to trash it or mock it for fear of what it could unleash or because they simply couldn't understand it. But intelligent film lovers take a little tolerance and SEE this. It is worth the search. This is film is a masterpiece of filmmaking!".

This reminded me of the scene in Being There where the simpleminded gardener parrots things that he heard on TV which get mistaken for profound intellectual statements. Of course there's nothing simple about this boy. Understanding his mental state requires a significant attention span. Even knowing the outcome of his mental instability the scene where he inflicts it is still a shock.Burton and Firth turn in fine performances as do Colin Blakely as the strict father Joan Plowright as the devoutly religious mother Harry Andrews as the stable owner and Jenny Agutter as one of the other employees.

	schema:reviewBody "Equus is based on a play by Peter Shaffer and focuses on a psychological investigation into a heinous crime committed by a young boy at a stable in Hampshire. The film handles themes that wont go down well with many audiences there are clear bestiality scenes made more shocking by the human participant's young age and some very shocking violence directed towards animals yet in spite of this the film still managed to get nominated for a few Oscars and that is testament to the great work put into it by the two central actors who do a brilliant job of bringing Peter Shaffer's story to life. The film begins with a description of the boy's crimes in a fit of rage he blinded a group of horses inside a stable. Psychiatrist Martin Dysart hears the story and decides to take on the case. Through talking to the boy as well as his family and other people that knew him the psychiatrist begins to build up a picture both of the boy's character and development as well as the events leading up to the atrocious crimes that he went on to commit.The interaction between the two central characters is the main focus of the film and this is also its central element. The film really needs two great actors to carry this off and it gets them in the form of Richard Burton and Peter Firth. Both of them fit into their characters very well and convince throughout Firth especially as he has to act out some rather uncomfortable scenes. At 138 minutes Equus seems like it might turn out to be a little bit too long but it actually makes very good use of it's time which flies by and the film doesn't become boring at all despite it's slow pace. I have not read the literature that this film is based on but unfortunately I got the impression that some things were left out of this one as it feels like the film has some defining point to make but one is never really made. The film also has holes regarding the reasoning behind the boy's strange development the religious and sexual themes come through but certain things are left unexplained. It all boils down to a shocking conclusion that will shock and offend many viewers. However despite some problems Equus is still an excellent film and one well worth spending time on.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Peter Shaffer's film 'Equus' the conflict between objectivity and subjectivity is explored through the relationship between Alan StrangFirth and the esteemed child Psychiatrist Dr Martin DysartBurton. Strang is an emotionally unstable 17yearold boy who has gouged out the eyes of six horses he cared for with a spike. After being found guilty at trial he is sent for rehabilitation at the hands of Dr Dysart a selfrepressed intellectual and eminent doctor. Strang lives his life subjectively and is passionate about horses after a tainted encounter with a rider on the beach when he was in childhood. His passion intensifies as he grows and reaches the point where he empathises with them and begins to worship them as enslaved gods. He sees them as Christlike figures which bear us and release us from our sins freedom. There is the clear suggestion that he is also having sexual congress with the animals as well. This is in conflict in his mind with his mother's passion for Catholicism which she drums into him relentlessly. She is overbearing and coddling and she constantly reminds him how God is everywhere' and that God sees everything.

He has a loveless marriage and grave doubts about his profession. He reads about passion he reads about Greek gods and legends and objectively enjoys ancient art. His dreams are tormented by a nightmare where he finds himself as a high priest noted for his efficiency with the blade who is performing a sacrifice. He becomes appalled at the act and afraid that his disgust will be noticed for fear of the consequences existential angst.As the play unfolds the extreme contrast between Strang's subjective existence and Dysart's objectivity develops and gradually Dysart begins to feel jealousy for Strang angry and frustrated at how his objective life denies passion. He questions who is worse off him or his patient. He is left wondering at the absurdity of his work and questioning the nature of his own existence.".

	schema:reviewBody "Perfect affectionate thrilling. The wild rush of the nude in the woods a perfect combination of soul and flesh a passion for inner freedom.Alan a 17yearold who had stabbed six horses blind was sent to a psychiatrist Martin. During the conversation Allen's passionate love and hatred for horses also affected Martin. He kept asking Allen and himself. Is the spiritual home of business people barren or rich? Is repression free to roam or tame? Is conflict a challenge or a surrender? Was Alan cruel or confused in stabbing the horse?The plot of the film follows the order in which Alan grew up.Alan 6 toils his castle on the beach.He thought there was no strong adhesive in the solid building. Like his family. When his parents to entertain the doctor Martin both husband and wife sitting position is face to face at home and they treat you the child's position their way of education the way they hide their true feelings are always in opposition.My mother is used to suppressing herself even when she is in a state of emotional breakdown. She preached to Alan the love of god the love of asceticism in Christianity the love of nature as indulgence as sin as redemption through selfpunishment. And when Allen went along with his own nature he was cursed as a depraved devil who denied him everything without knowing it. She lived in a religion she didn't quite understand.In contrast to his mother's cowardice Allen's father was autocratic autocratic violent dismissive and evasive.Parents are in a position of authority with their children and regulations with restrictions are out of protection. They are worried about the influence of the outside world on their children and they are also afraid of losing their superiority and control. It is pedantic and backward to keep the children in a state of ignorant and ignorant to enlarge the evil of human nature and to erect the barrier of insulating society.Alan who had no friends was attracted by the live horses. Children who yearn to be free from loneliness try to touch the black horse and feel the living animal. The black knight's encouragement released Alan's freedom freedom and even indulgence the power to harness and control powerful forces the ability to feel selfradiating. Take me away he was led to cry and speed passion danger relative desolation boredom and restraint were no doubt full of temptation and attraction.And his parents are afraid of his selfknowledge strong pull away even at the expense of him. Alan's father attributed the spinning horse to a dangerous population. Just as he tore up the image of Christ he did not allow any authority to stand in for his parents. For Alan the horse was more than a creature he loved to be close to with its soft fur scorching heat and a chain of iron in his mouth that caused pain.Allen of 12 years old in his mother and the same religious story under the influence of negative human repressed bound with the youth germination of sexual consciousness think that it is a sin and the supervision over their own tortured body before the horse. He dressed himself up as a horse with a bridle on his head and with a stick in his hand he beat himself violently seeking relief from his pain. Through the pain of the body to eliminate the desire imprison the spirit in order to save and selfdiscipline.On the wall of Alan's room Martin the doctor saw wild animals and demure figures crisscrossing each other. This seems to imply the chaotic state of young people's pursuit of inner freedom and obedience to authority.The unity of knight and horse is the union of perfect ideal and spiritual freedom. The film emphasizes repeatedly that the two cannot be separated. Alan could not distinguish between the two and even lost himself in confusion.Allen 17 parents selfish due education raise no reading disability in addition to television advertising in addition to the mother forcedly stories have no history knowledge knowledge without physics engineering biology etc. In the first meeting with the doctor Martin kept singing green arrow gum martini doctor's tea and other advertising songs. This is another aspect to show the monotony and lack of Allen's spiritual world.Martin used the words religion education and memory with blood. He dreamed that he become big sacrifice of blade to kill children questions the meaning of the psychiatrist has done is subconscious but a little bit of the germination of revolt made him a bit out of the mainstream consciousness behavior of panic fear woke up.Martin is in communication with Alan from envy he closed lonely self to understand his mental distress and again and torture in self survival significance for their real life and work but can't find the path of liberation bound.Martin's world is constantly asking about the power his career gives him the power to control other people's emotions and force them to admit and snoop into other people's privacy. He envied Alan and regarded Alan with detestable venom as the creator of his own pain.This is also the envy most adults have for young people. The undaunted dynamic adults who have been bound by the rules of society or who have been playing with them and benefiting from them can no longer resist without them.Like Dalton the rancher when you're excited to walk around the sofa isn't it like a horse jogging around the yard? The rein is in control of the direction. He was angry and regretted his lack of alertness and attention and his shaken confidence would forever affect his trust in others in the future. This is social classroom teaching.Alan and Martin clashed in therapy. In response to the doctor's questions Allen went from silent to nonjudgmental singing denying evasion and swapping secrets oneonone.Of course as an adult Martin used trickery. Seeing Allen's desire for understanding and communication he prescribed a placebo  a nonpharmacological drug prescribed in the name of therapeutic efficacy  known as a truth drug.Allen spoke irrepressibly of his past.Especially for the horse to wear bridle in the night to sneak out. Before he rode he would feed the sugar cubes letting the faithful horse and himself carry out the ritual of devouring his SINS. It is worth mentioning that the sugar has E or A written on each side which should be the initials of Equus horse Latin and Alan Allen's name possibly mimicking the rituals of death and rebirth.Alan railed against the commercial world in which electronics and kitchenware became junk and horses were king. Rebellious confrontation only took place in the dark night when Allen sought spiritual and sexual freedom by riding naked. Ironically the shackled harness was the first thing to go out. No matter how naked his body is his spiritual world has been tied down and he can run away at ease. His ideas are the teachings of Christ stem the even and beautiful girl and honest can escape the intangible feelings of guilt he stabbed the eyes of a blind horse trying to get rid of the oppression of spiritual but ignores the horse as a divine materialized his heart to be perfect to the world of crime and punishment is the real prison collapse of belief.There is a lot of contrast in the film.Allen room two images contrast Christ's crown of thorns under long hair and bridle mane Christ's hands cuffed chain and the horse's mouth bit and bridle AiGu look in the eyes of Christ and charming eyes moist. Alan regarded Christ as divinity horses as the materialization of divinity the best living love to be felt. And the horse is the universal god who is always watching him always supervising him the more authoritative being in Allen's mind than his parents.Two slow motion One is Allen before riding screamed against commodity economy system one is in the stable after the horse's eyes eye and ruby red horse horsehead dagger appear alternately. The sharp dagger appears in the stopmotion scene at the beginning of the movie. The worship of tall faith may be the reason why the bloody story was cut apart.Alan passed the vegetable patch and the pond at night. One was a gallop under the starlight of a horse. One was walking next to the girl Jill. Squatting in the cabbage patch of a group of children shaking a moonlit pond the pale blue walls of a mottled horse house leave the same way as return but with different companions. The man and horse Alan loved in his heart could not be spiritually united and became what his mother called a knight and a horse. Finally it led to juvenile delirium.Alan praised the horse and Jill alike  beautiful and moving.The reaction of different people to the same action consciousness or object in a movie.In therapy Allen's denial can be seen as a condition of selfprotection. It's like when he was attacked by his father and he said no.Martin's denial avoidance is that he refuses to introspect and refuses to see his heart.Alan's father went into a pornographic movie theater and lied to his son. His pale excuse was just an attempt to restore the authority of the family. Alan was conscious of his father's good looks and for the first time refused his father's face to face opposition to authority. This is the beginning of independent thinking and independent personality.The iron chain in the mouth of a horse is called the horse mouth rank. It is a kind of harness to correct the direction of the horse's march and it will also hurt the horse to some extent.For Allen to this is the doctrine of heavy moral chains is the price of adult copy is like artificially grown trees have been cut to escape suffering situation will inevitably experience hurt or to harm innocent and limpid eyes slowly accident and opacity. The pain of the chain is the price of salvation.Martin kept asking why me? In his treatment of Allen he pondered the erosion of the commercial soci".

It is pedantic and backward to keep the children in a state of ignorant and ignorant to enlarge the evil of human nature and to erect the barrier of insulating society.Alan who had no friends was attracted by the live horses. Children who yearn to be free from loneliness try to touch the black horse and feel the living animal. The black knight's encouragement released Alan's freedom freedom and even indulgence the power to harness and control powerful forces the ability to feel selfradiating. Take me away he was led to cry and speed passion danger relative desolation boredom and restraint were no doubt full of temptation and attraction.And his parents are afraid of his selfknowledge strong pull away even at the expense of him. Alan's father attributed the spinning horse to a dangerous population. Just as he tore up the image of Christ he did not allow any authority to stand in for his parents. For Alan the horse was more than a creature he loved to be close to with its soft fur scorching heat and a chain of iron in his mouth that caused pain.Allen of 12 years old in his mother and the same religious story under the influence of negative human repressed bound with the youth germination of sexual consciousness think that it is a sin and the supervision over their own tortured body before the horse. He dressed himself up as a horse with a bridle on his head and with a stick in his hand he beat himself violently seeking relief from his pain. Through the pain of the body to eliminate the desire imprison the spirit in order to save and selfdiscipline.On the wall of Alan's room Martin the doctor saw wild animals and demure figures crisscrossing each other. This seems to imply the chaotic state of young people's pursuit of inner freedom and obedience to authority.The unity of knight and horse is the union of perfect ideal and spiritual freedom. The film emphasizes repeatedly that the two cannot be separated. Alan could not distinguish between the two and even lost himself in confusion.Allen 17 parents selfish due education raise no reading disability in addition to television advertising in addition to the mother forcedly stories have no history knowledge knowledge without physics engineering biology etc. In the first meeting with the doctor Martin kept singing green arrow gum martini doctor's tea and other advertising songs. This is another aspect to show the monotony and lack of Allen's spiritual world.Martin used the words religion education and memory with blood. He dreamed that he become big sacrifice of blade to kill children questions the meaning of the psychiatrist has done is subconscious but a little bit of the germination of revolt made him a bit out of the mainstream consciousness behavior of panic fear woke up.Martin is in communication with Alan from envy he closed lonely self to understand his mental distress and again and torture in self survival significance for their real life and work but can't find the path of liberation bound.Martin's world is constantly asking about the power his career gives him the power to control other people's emotions and force them to admit and snoop into other people's privacy. He envied Alan and regarded Alan with detestable venom as the creator of his own pain.This is also the envy most adults have for young people. The undaunted dynamic adults who have been bound by the rules of society or who have been playing with them and benefiting from them can no longer resist without them.Like Dalton the rancher when you're excited to walk around the sofa isn't it like a horse jogging around the yard? The rein is in control of the direction. He was angry and regretted his lack of alertness and attention and his shaken confidence would forever affect his trust in others in the future. This is social classroom teaching.Alan and Martin clashed in therapy. In response to the doctor's questions Allen went from silent to nonjudgmental singing denying evasion and swapping secrets oneonone.Of course as an adult Martin used trickery. Seeing Allen's desire for understanding and communication he prescribed a placebo  a nonpharmacological drug prescribed in the name of therapeutic efficacy  known as a truth drug.Allen spoke irrepressibly of his past.Especially for the horse to wear bridle in the night to sneak out. Before he rode he would feed the sugar cubes letting the faithful horse and himself carry out the ritual of devouring his SINS. It is worth mentioning that the sugar has E or A written on each side which should be the initials of Equus horse Latin and Alan Allen's name possibly mimicking the rituals of death and rebirth.Alan railed against the commercial world in which electronics and kitchenware became junk and horses were king. Rebellious confrontation only took place in the dark night when Allen sought spiritual and sexual freedom by riding naked. Ironically the shackled harness was the first thing to go out. No matter how naked his body is his spiritual world has been tied down and he can run away at ease. His ideas are the teachings of Christ stem the even and beautiful girl and honest can escape the intangible feelings of guilt he stabbed the eyes of a blind horse trying to get rid of the oppression of spiritual but ignores the horse as a divine materialized his heart to be perfect to the world of crime and punishment is the real prison collapse of belief.There is a lot of contrast in the film.Allen room two images contrast Christ's crown of thorns under long hair and bridle mane Christ's hands cuffed chain and the horse's mouth bit and bridle AiGu look in the eyes of Christ and charming eyes moist. Alan regarded Christ as divinity horses as the materialization of divinity the best living love to be felt. And the horse is the universal god who is always watching him always supervising him the more authoritative being in Allen's mind than his parents.Two slow motion One is Allen before riding screamed against commodity economy system one is in the stable after the horse's eyes eye and ruby red horse horsehead dagger appear alternately. The sharp dagger appears in the stopmotion scene at the beginning of the movie. The worship of tall faith may be the reason why the bloody story was cut apart.Alan passed the vegetable patch and the pond at night. One was a gallop under the starlight of a horse. One was walking next to the girl Jill. Squatting in the cabbage patch of a group of children shaking a moonlit pond the pale blue walls of a mottled horse house leave the same way as return but with different companions. The man and horse Alan loved in his heart could not be spiritually united and became what his mother called a knight and a horse. Finally it led to juvenile delirium.Alan praised the horse and Jill alike  beautiful and moving.The reaction of different people to the same action consciousness or object in a movie.In therapy Allen's denial can be seen as a condition of selfprotection. It's like when he was attacked by his father and he said no.Martin's denial avoidance is that he refuses to introspect and refuses to see his heart.Alan's father went into a pornographic movie theater and lied to his son. His pale excuse was just an attempt to restore the authority of the family. Alan was conscious of his father's good looks and for the first time refused his father's face to face opposition to authority. This is the beginning of independent thinking and independent personality.The iron chain in the mouth of a horse is called the horse mouth rank. It is a kind of harness to correct the direction of the horse's march and it will also hurt the horse to some extent.For Allen to this is the doctrine of heavy moral chains is the price of adult copy is like artificially grown trees have been cut to escape suffering situation will inevitably experience hurt or to harm innocent and limpid eyes slowly accident and opacity. The pain of the chain is the price of salvation.Martin kept asking why me? In his treatment of Allen he pondered the erosion of the commercial soci";

	schema:headline " Great and unfortunately obscure film";
	schema:reviewBody "I must admit I did not know about this film until recently when I came across it by chance. Well what a formidable surprise it was finding out it is actually a great psychological drama.In a nutshell Equus tells the story of a psychiatrist treating a teenager who was arrested for blinding six horses at the stable where he used to work. The doctor finds out more and more about the boy's strange obsession with horses which finally makes him doubt about his own perception of reality and attitude towards life.The film sucks you in right from the beginning with Richard Burton's fourth wall breaking monologue setting the tone for what is to come. The rest of the film is a great psychological study of the characters especially the boy Alan Strang brilliantly played by Peter Firth but also the doctor one of the last great roles from Richard Burton. What really impresses me here is how the film delves into the depths of the human mind and represents many of its complexities and contradictions.Speaking of representation it is also important to know that Equus is the adaptation of a play of the same name written by Peter Shaffer. Regarding the dialogues the film kept the ones from the play. The most interesting thing about the adaptation is how some of the words are converted into images for example when Alan Strang tells about his experiences with horses. The kind of unsettling and surreal imagery accompanying these moments contributes to the creation of a dreamlike mood that takes the film to a new level of immersion.As for the film's substance I've read somewhere it is supposed to be a metaphor for homosexuality. I don't know if that is true anyway the sexual undertone is clearly there. However this is far from being the only aspect of it. For me this film raised fundamental questions about the human condition and about what it means to achieve spiritual freedom. What I mostly like about that is how the film portrays the passion needed to attain this freedom. It acknowledges its positive aspect of exaltation but focuses on the more intriguing negative aspect of suffering. This struggle is brilliantly represented by the doctor who starts doubting if he has the right to cure Alan thus easing his suffering but also eliminating his true self and his freedom to live spiritual experiences and be more than the everyday man. Another detail I really enjoyed about this film is the aura it creates around the relationship between Alan and the horses. The whole religious aspect of it was very well developed and had an almost mystical quality to it.Finally if I had to point out something negative about this film I could probably say that being the adaptation of a play it's of course very talky and the dialogues are not always easy to follow. However in my opinion it was a good choice to keep Peter Shaffer's words in the film. This allows the film to go further in the exploration of the character's minds while also being an important part of its mysterious and haunting atmosphere.So on the whole I think this is a great film that manages not only to establish particular mood and to tell a compelling story but also to raise very pertinent questions about the human psyche and our relation to the self and to the world. It tells us about ourselves as all art should do. The only thing I don't understand is that this is such an obscure film especially considering it was directed by Sidney Lumet 12 Angry Men Serpico etc.... Anyway this is an excellent film in my opinion and I absolutely recommend anyone to watch this sadly forgotten gem.".

Now that I watched the film oh boy. This is one strange weird film mostly because Lumet attempts it in probably one of the few instances in his career like an director of the avantgarde. The material touches on if not outright confronts subjects that were outthere or taboo for the 70s let alone today the fragmentation of religion on youth the suppression of sex the depths and as it turns out passion of madness philosophical probing of what psychiatry can even do for someone and of course bestiality. It's also one of the most wondrously provocative films of the late 1970s.How does Lumet pull it off? Have the right actors first of course. Richard Burton was almost thought to be too much of a risk too drunk and an overactor to hire but he's just right for the part of Dr. Dysart he's as sharp and even compassionate a 'shrink' one would want especially if one is young but there's conflict in the routine of doing this and that going along helping others but getting no real passion for anything in life in return including no children and an unresponsive wife. Burton taps into this dissatisfaction like it's Shakespearean in the grandiose moments breaking the forth wall talking right to the audience from his desk but at the same time he's also great at subtle scenes quiet bits where he has to convey so much of his own sadness in his eyes.Then there's Peter Firth. Good God. This is one of the most bizarre performances of a mentally unwell man I've ever come across where he first appears with striking enigmatic eyes singing Doublemint ads and then only bit by bit reveals his layers. Alan Strang is little tricky at times does he really know more than he'll say or is his vulnerability and demons legit? He's put in Dysart's care to start because he did a rather unique act of violence and cruelty against animals blinding six horses all in the stretch of a minute. Why? Why itself is one of the questions posed ironically enough in the midst of Equus. But really the focal point here is Strang played by Firth like some passiveaggressive bloke with a deep dark history of an oppressive mother an uncommonly good Joan Plowright weakwilled father also very good Colin Blakey and of course with those horses whom we see in his described flashbacks going all nude with one horse out at night in an ecstasy that goes between the sexual and some kind of crazed religious rite of passage. It's rare an actor embodies someone like Strang but Firth does it exceptionally.But there's more lots more as Schaffer's script plows not just through the pain of Alan Strang but the torment that seeps through to Dr. Dysart who's whole outlook on what he's doing is altered by this one kid. The levels and layers here are a lot more dense than one might be expecting it's not a simple revelation into the mind of a boy disturbed by not simply those around him but his own conceptions of things altering from God knows where and by God knows what how did that beach scene as a little kid affect him? who knows it happened is all. What's hard for me to shake though is how Lumet probes this like I've never seen from him before. Aside from the choice of material being unusual one might think Ken Russell would take this on long before someone of Lumet who made classics like Serpico Dog Day Afternoon and Network in the same decade he goes for the abstract in camera movements in a subjective kind of lighting like in the climactic stable scene and it's exhilarating to see him go past the expectations of a stage play while those who've seen it will say otherwise for those seeing the film first one wonders how the hell this was pulled off on a stage.It's a staggering feat from any director yet from Lumet it's a wonderfully deranged work that plumbs the human condition for all its worth in the prism of a unique situation developing with very real raw characterizations. It's hard to tell who to recommend this to exactly but I know I do strongly at least for those who like the challenging from their auteurs. Just be ready for a lot of firth with those horses.".

He also made some phenomenal British movies the best of which are 'The Offence' 1972 and 'Equus' 1977.I came to this film knowing very little about it and am very glad for that fact as it is not something to which justice can be done in a small summary of its story nor is it a story that would make most people subsequently want to see the film. For this reason I will simply tell you that this film's power is not in its story but in its exceptional delivery.Lumet's films almost always have a certain unspoken quality to them that is very hard to define. I used to think it was the absence of a director's mark but that is precisely the mark of Lumet we don't know he's there. There is never any notion of selfconsciousness in his films and in a film this prone to pretension that is quite a feat.Shaffer's writing is inspired and meticulously researched but never at the expense of the audience's attention. The psychology and philosophy that form the undercurrent of this movie demand that it be a slow paced film and that the viewer be prepared to ask themselves a lot of difficult questions but the result is ultimately all the more rewarding.I cannot imagine that the two leads could've been better cast. The criminally underrated Peter Firth manages to evoke fear confusion and pity without ever resorting to acting by numbers. There is a coherence to his character which makes us want to put the pieces together which is precisely why Burton's doctor is so drawn to him in the film. Burton is also on fine form and Lumet does a wonderful job of keeping him on the screen despite the theatricality of the character and his dialogue not to mention that of Burton as an actor.This is not a film I would recommend to many people as it is not easy viewing and it demands a good deal of emotional intelligence and the patience to use it. This is far from popcorn. If that statement makes you want to see the film even more I recommend you do so as soon as possible.I would also highly recommend The Offense. httpuk.imdb.comtitlett0070468".

The main actor Choi Seung Hyeon who is also known as TOP in Big Bang did a great job. He acts impressively with his eyes showing us how a student knowing nothing becomes to get to fight to kill for the sake of his own team. Other actors did not show the best of them especially Kwon Sang Woo. He could do better than that but I feel that the character he played was not fully described. The music was not very impressive to me however the effect was quite real and welldone for a Asian war movie. Since this is based on a true story the end can easily be predicted but that does not mean it was a boring end. They show us how people die in war they may have different backgrounds but still can become real soldier once needed.".

It also shows you don't need a budget like that of some Hollywood movies. The biggest thing for me is that it is a true story and is dramatised well. Without being too political with the ongoing problems in Korea they could have made the North out to be animals but they don't.For a film that probably wont be mentioned at the big ceremonies it is a loss for filmmaking. I would highly recommend this film if you haven't seen it yet. Would love to see Britain make films as good as this but I haven't seen many recently that comes close.

	schema:reviewBody "War film action junkies sit up and take note as 71 Into the Fire should be written into your books as a must watch if you haven't already made plans to do so. Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan may have set the bar and raised expectations many years ago with regards to the use of strained colours and realistic war violence being portrayed on screen and in recent years even China too got into the act through Feng Xiaogang's The Assembly. While tales of heroism during WWII have been aplenty done by filmmakers from the West I can only think of a handful done in the East to meet that kind of scale. This is one of them.Directed by John H. Lee the basis of the film reported came from a letter from one of the 71 deceased South Korean student soldiers which chronicled their Alamo experience and moment as the few who had to stand up to the invading North Korean masses in very David and Goliath measures. Tasked with the strategically important defense of Pohang while the rest of what's left of the South Korean army and UN coalition defended the Nakdong River area this is not 300 where a group of battle hardened soldiers led by King Leonidis tragically fended off the huge Persian army but a group of rag tag students with little military experience being told to hold their ground for 2 hours against a fanatical professional army before reinforcements arrive.You can feel the sense of urgency and desperation throughout the film as Lee doesn't forget to remind you how dire the situation was with the tremendous loss of territory over a period of four months to the North Korean forces sledgehammering its way down south and the reliance of students to take up arms in what could have been a tactical lesser of two evils. The UN Coalition is stretched thin and the makeshift Captain of the ragtag student group soft spoken Oh JungBum T.O.P has some serious growing up to do if he is to lead the students being one of three who have had some combat experience. Making things difficult is the inclusion of criminals like KapJo Kwon Sang Woo who's just happy to be out of prison to lend his weight to the fight but as with any army that requires discipline here is one man and his two lieutenants who prefer the contrary.From the get go you'll get thrown thick into the action with loud gunfire and pretty much everything exploding on screen from artillery and other big guns fire as JungBum wanders around his battalion doing errands like topping up and delivery of magazines and rounds to soldiers only to find his side of the forces constantly retreating and being caught up in a life and death situation. Clearly not the hero he thinks he could be he soon gets sent packing into a truck and again the North under the leadership of Commander Park MuRang Cha SeungWon is triumphant and merciless in their taking of additional territory.More set action sequences are to follow and each are carefully crafted to reap maximum effect for the filmgoer as we root for the student soldiers as they stand their ground and rely on their street smarts to come up with some form of defense system to protect their minuscule turf. While luck has them chancing upon caches of abandoned weapons improvisation meant the welcoming of Molotov cocktails still a weapon of choice for guerrilla styled riots and various forms of gasfuelfire combination. Not being military strategists the students are susceptible to the oldest trick in the book like ambushes and each challenge they come up toward meant a reduction in their already pathetic numbers.Perhaps it is their making of such naive mistakes that draw in on the harshness of war where director Lee doesn't spare us much of the gory details from bursting wounds and machine gun fire from up close ripping up bodies. As the adage goes don't die for your country but make the other bastard die for his. However this film depicts Koreans killing Koreans so therein lies an opportunity to address some of this insanity why people ought to be killing their own comrades and countrymen even having the North Korean commander at times exhibiting being a maverick willing to go against battle orders albeit to satisfy his bruised ego that had been wounded by a bunch of students against his own troops.There's no lack of drama and tension as well brought on when JungBum and KapJo have to go head to head in order to earn each other's mutual respect but before that the gangsters' shenanigans prove to be running against the grain of the student soldier's mission. For Jung Bum we witness how he matures from boy to man while KapJo learns about responsibility and what it means to be counted upon in contrast to his selfish ways since the enemy is now real and right at their doorstep. Unfortunately while this film has 71 student soldiers split into two platoons realistically you're not going to have to get to know all of them so only these two fly the character development flag for the rest.Well made with excellent production values and sets depicting the state of war affairs during the Korean War 71 Into the Fire will go into my books as one of the best this year in its genre. Highly recommended especially when viewed on the big screen!".

	schema:reviewBody "A heartfelt and passionate Korean War epic 71  INTO THE FIRE marks the epitome of selfsacrifice brotherly love and gungho soldierly bravery. It's a simple enough tale which crucially really happened 71 schoolboys were tasked with holding back a North Korean division singlehandedly during the Korean War in 1950. What follows  their holdingout against impossible odds  sounds too good to be true but yes it really happened and it makes for great moviemaking.The only South Korean war movie I'd seen previously was the superlative BROTHERHOOD so I had no idea what to expect from this production. I got it all thoroughly engaging characters an interesting storyline and typically stylish direction. Yes it's a slow builder of a movie it takes an hour and a half before things really get going but then the climax hits and you've rarely seen anything so intense and devastating in equal measure. Solid performances throughout contribute to the overall feel that this is a great movie.".

It is somewhat clichd  but this works in its favor  what we get is a Braveheart feeling for a small but very wellmade war film.The two main leads are competent if a little OTT in their roles but again by the end this pays off and I really have no complaints  if moving and exciting war films are your thing then this is definitely worth viewing.".

Most of the critics comment TOP from Big Bang being casted just for pure publicity but he is a good actor as proved from a past Korean drama he did called IRIS. The sadness of the Korean War and the desperation of the people at that time were wonderfully portrayed.

	schema:reviewBody "The true story directed by John H. Lee A Moment to Remember about South Korean student unit of 71 soldiers who was left to defend the girls middle school during the Battle of Pohang during the peek of North Korea's invasion of South in 1950. That 71 students defended that position for 11 hours against a North Korean army brigade and the film was inspired by the letters of one of that soldiers. Out of 71 members of the unit only three had combat experience while others have not undergone any training before the battle which makes their resistance unbelievable.The story focuses on two soldiers Oh JungBum frightened and lost commander of the unit who only got the position because of his experience that was minimal and Ku KapJo convicted of murder who enlisted in the Army to avoid jail. A good part of the story rests on their conflict and on development of their relationship as well as their relationship with the rest of the unit. Character development is uncommonly done. Oh JungBum changes from a scared kid who couldn't even shot from the gun to brave commander absurdly fast while Ku KapJo's path is approximately opposite and just as fast if not faster. In this context we can mention the North Korean captain Park MuRang which is extremely difficult to characterize as he's almost like another character in almost every scene while only he's egotism stays.Performance is standard Asian full of melodrama highlighting the pride and courage and a somewhat caricature acting that is pretty solid here. Cha Seungwon is far form being brilliant in lead role of Oh JungBum almost completely without emotions as if he was forced to act in this movie. The rest of the acting team did a solid job. The pace of storytelling is perfect not one scene is redundant although movie could work without humorous parts they deliver alongside humor additional characterization of the characters. It's a simple dynamic story with which time goes by quickly. There's no objections to the visual part of the film. A solid budget of 10mil dollars was well used the effects look almost authentic. Final battle looks really impressive although it can not be overlooked that it was somewhat idealized.Film lacks historical context which is not surprising given that as usually happens with Far Eastern cinema it's made for their market so they didn't feel like it's necessarily to explain situation but however it does not affect much on the experience of the film since the theme is universal and 71 Into the Fire is one of the better war movies lately.".

	schema:headline " Good not great";
	schema:reviewBody "It's not bad. It's not great. From the few Englishlanguage comments about 71 one can piece together that it's a movie vehicle for local teen heartthrobs kind of like casting the Jonas Brothers in a recreation of The Alamo or the Tet Offensive. There's even a short bittersweet dance sequence before the final slaughter as the unprepared volunteer soldiers await the attack by North Korean troops. I'm sure it's meant as a wink to the actors' fans but it plays just fine on a dramatic level not least because it's brief.The movie seems to have had a good budget for a Korean actioner with support from the military. It's shot with very narrow depth of field a choice that may seem unnatural for a panoramic war movie but heightens the shock and subjectivity of the experience for the teenage heroes who are in way over their head from the getgo. There are two superb sequences. One is a chase through the woods as the south Koreans chase a North Korean sniper who's been sent to draw them out. They follow him into a wheat field where the commies are nestled camouflaged a la Tom Berenger in Sniper. The inevitable firefight doesn't go where you'd expect it to and adds to the tension between the young captain who leads the student soldiers and the cocky thief who's been dumped on their squad.The second great sequence follows soon after. The top North Korean drives straight into the enemy's compound white flag waving and undermines the hero's credibility with a simple offer surrender and we'll let you live. The surrender scene is a combat trope par excellence but here it's handled with such slow Leonestyle buildup and centered on a terrific performance that it's elevated into something special. It takes a good two minutes for the whiteclad North Korean just to get out of his Jeep wipe the dust off his boot and condescendingly shove a useless prisoner back into the ranks before he even opens his mouth. As the scene wears on it becomes clear the hero will have a mutiny on his hands. Good stuff.The movie is nuanced toward the North as the southern heroes repeatedly discover the humanity of their enemy. Eastwood did something similar with his pair of Iwo Jima movies and I don't know enough about Korean culture to say whether this signifies changing attitudes toward the North.The final battle some 20 minutes worth of wanton slaughter and deeply saturated pyrotechnics using a wide variety of period hardware is notable for its use of physical stunts and squibs and for its clear delineation of the space it takes place in something a lot of action movie makers have lately forgotten. What it lacks utterly is suspense because the movie makers have already shown us that reinforcements are coming and the heroes' fate is already etched in history. To quote Josey Wales If things look bad and it looks like you're not gonna make it you gotta get mean. These student soldiers get mean all right. For all its emphasis on gore and painful ways to die that recall the gut wound death scene in Ryan the movie also stoops to really icky sentimentality in these final moments  indeed throughout the story as it cuts to shots of hysterically wailing moms as the young volunteers are trucked off and a cringeinducing letterwriting voiceover probably inspired by Saving Private Ryan. It's tonally wrong just as the earlier comicrelief with a fat soldier who eats raw potatoes feels wrong and it's this sort of weirdness that is keeping even big budget Korean movies from breaking into the American market. Maybe Brett Ratner should reedit and chop down this one like he did the Bollywood movie Kites.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first read about this movie on a Korean site looking up Korean entertainment it was probably up pretty quick since it has the Korean rapper TOP in it who is in a popular Kpop group Big Bang. Anyways I also managed to watch the trailers on YouTube and it looked promising and I must say the trailer was better than the actual movie itself after viewing. I felt a lot of the characters went to waste like the nurse for instance who just treats Seunghyeon Choi wounds and doesn't appear for the rest of the movie. The movie would have been so much better if it was more engaging and you actually care for the character and you do care a bit but not enough to really worry if they die or live. The film also seems to rely to much on the cinematography since the camera changes constantly but not really effectively. It just constantly switches to TOP's facial expressions a LOT but I guess it's to please the fan girls while the guys enjoy the action scenes. TOP's acting got better but it's just passable and Kwon SangWoo really overdoes it in order to stand out but just comes off as obnoxious but he did have his moments. Cha SeungWon did a fine job of playing the charismatic North Korean commander although his scenes are very few he did a fine job just not very memorable. I wished it found a way to get more in depth with the characters cause most of them didn't really stand out to me. Another annoying aspect of the film is how the North Korean soldiers fights like retarded drones that is just asking to get shot by running straight into bullets yeah it's a movie but it got irritating to watch cause of the stupidity. I know they tried to make the final scene all epic but I couldn't help but roll my eyes. I didn't feel cheated while walking out of the theaters but was a bit let down. I also noticed there were more girls in the theater seats than guys I guess TOP makes up for his lack of acting skills in order to get the female viewers to go watch his movie. Like Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner in the Twilight movies. Anyways good movie with a average plot and pretty cardboard characters and a lot of stuff blowing up.7.110".

Despite very heavy losses and sustaining large number of casualties the students stood their ground and kept the school. The film is a classical South Korean cinematography with awesome battle sequences tremendous nature shots excellent development of characters and very masterful balance between serious and funny tragic and comic deep and cowardly.

Just about all of them are totally corrupt in the filmeven more so than Geonsoo who has been taking bribes as well as his involvement in the hit and run and disposing of the body! I have no idea how accurate this portrayal is but it sure makes you think twice about going to visit the country! Another thing that surprised me was that I liked the film. This is a surprise because I generally don't like action films. Normally such a movie wouldn't interest me...but this one managed to. But as I mentioned above it is a bit derivative...though it certainly is not exactly like I Know What You Did Last Summer. The only real deficit I otherwise noticed was the big finale. While it was supertense and exciting it completely lacked realism. No one can take that much punishment and STILL be alive...yet one of the characters seems almost immune to anything Geonsoo can throw at him literally. The bottom line is that the film is superentertaining provided you don't think too much near this crazy ending.".

The actual event is the engagement of a garrison of teenage male studentsoldiers conscripted into the South Korean Army Republic of Korea Army to hold negligible defensive positions against the advancing 5th Division of the North Korean People's Army. Moreover the defensive position is the students Middle school which lies enroute to the geographical strategic point of the Nakdong River which was defended by the regular South Korean Army. Prior to the main theme of the movie the opening 20minutes set the bases of the following story in an introductory outburst of combat violence. The South Korean Army utilized students has ammunition runners during battles. One particular student Oh Jangbeom is later forced into becoming the leader of a platoon of 71 studentsoldiers none simply than because he is one of only three of the students who has any experience in combat. In addition the opening 20minutes is a synopsis testimonial of the South Korean Armies precipitous retreat and the unfortunate predicament the frightened civilians population of South Korea found themselves in during the June invasion. One noteworthy inclusion pays attention to the famous the incident of the panicked South Korean military action of blowing up a bridge over the Han River which was a strategic defensive point therefor trapping civilians to the mercy of the advancing North Koreans People's Army. 71 Into the Fire pursues the now standard monotonous actiondrama formula indicative of modern war films. There are the established close up hand held camera work sharpened sound and colour graphic combat fatalities and injuries and excessive visionary suffering. The pace of the film is balanced between conflict and benevolence. The acting is worthy of note keeping in contour with the story. 71 Into the Fire makes prominent how one identical nation dating from a once remote period of great age surviving through interludes of independence and colonization now separated by a contrived political boundary can quickly become preeminent enemies divided by separate political ideologies. The students press democratic views and open opinions on leadership and battle formation the North totalitarian domination. They were no longer a nation striving for nationalism yet communists and imperialist nationals divided by political and outside spheres of influence in another 20th century conflict of proxy resulting in an artificial political line dividing a country which as seen bloodshed and citizens continue to live in fear due to the actions of postwar consternation of other nations in proxy the name of politics. For all its brutality and honorable intentions by the end of the film I felt like this film pungently contrived the Korean war as Childs play and a bit of fun in the school yard instead of the unimaginable horror witnessed by the population. It is obvious that the target audience is college aged South Koreans reminding the assemblage of free citizens the price sacrificed by their grandparents. However 71 Into the Fire is an invigorating if not odd 60th anniversary tribute in honor of the many young soldiers who lost their lives during the Korean war either regular or in this insistence conscripted into defending their country in an avoidable conflict.".

	schema:headline " 71 Into the Fire Awful Hollowness based on a reallife war story";
	schema:reviewBody "Fortunately 71 Into the Fire officially released on last Thursday in South Korea is not the bottom of the barrel. But still it's near the bottom of the barrel. The movie is not as ideologically repulsive as I feared but this is awfully hollow without any clear direction let alone clear emotions. The result is one of the worst war movies since Pearl Harbor and one of few saving graces of 71 Into the Fire is that it's onehour shorter than that. The war is hell the war is a mess but the war movie must not be a mess at any chance.After crossing the 38 parallels on June 25th in 1950 North Korean military relentlessly advanced toward the south while capturing Seoul and several major cities except Pusan within a month. They seemed to be near the victory and South Korean military fought at all cost at the last front line of the Nakdong River to protect Pusan with nowhere else to step behind while desperately waiting for UN troopsAs one commander points out in the movie they would have had no option except jumping into the sea if the line had been broken down. The Battle of Pusan Perimeter was one of the most turbulent moments of Korean war and many of South Korean soldiers sacrificed their lives. It's inarguable that our generation owed them a lot for our freedom and prosperity and more.The movie is based on the one of the combats that actually happened during that time. Because other soldiers must go to Pusan Perimeter the bunch of boy soldiers freshly drafted by South Korean military are left to defend the front line near the city named Pohang at the small school building of countryside. Soon North Korean soldiers led by their ruthless charismatic leaderSeungwon Cha is approaching to their place for the strategic advantage. These young students little experience and little resource must secure their front line no matter how.Before leaving them The commanding officerSeungwoo Kim appoints one of boy soldiers JangBumKorean pop star T.O.P to be the leader of these young soldiers only because he has recently gotten the first taste of battle. JangBum is not so confident about his new role and so do other soldiers including some antagonizing bully and his gangs. They cannot accept Jangbum as the leader at first but with massive menace coming toward them minute by minute they really have to stick together to protect their country and maybe to save themselves.A good setting for war movie but the movie ruins this in every possible way despite having lots of good things to utilize. Sometimes it reaches to the level of the amusement mixed with lots of annoyance. I don't mind about simple black  white situation depicted in the movie but the characters in the movie are the battalion of cardboards. They are mainly the pawns manipulated by the terrible script with awful dialogues and no depth is given to any of them. Only Jangbum is given some space but that is usually decorated with cringeinducing yellow lightcoated flashbacks about his mother. There is no convincing character development and we don't care about the characters at all. In fact I was glad to see some characters dispatched during the movie. Above all the movie is repulsive with its alarming shallowness. The director JaHan Lee seems to only care about making the movie look nice without any consideration to the story itself  if it ever exists. For example there is the scene where the commander blows up the bridge while desperate refugees wanting to cross over it. My god the movie cares far more about the big explosion than the desperation of common people. How spectacularly good it looks!The massive budget behind the production is clearly shown on the screen but oh boy how clumsy these action sequences are. It seems like to have been made with the thought that only explosions and shaky camera works are everything. I'm sure I can make a better experience at my mother's kitchen.In the end socalled big payoff comes as the entertainment and we see two main charactersI don't have to tell you who they are valiantly do Rambo things at the top of the building while North Korean soldiers become more like zombies. It won't be a serious matter if it tries to be like Inglourious Basterds. However when the movie sets out to be as serious as Saving Private Ryan that is just like the kiss of death.Last week I watched another Korean War movie Tae Guk Gi for the comparison and I think I should have been more generous to that. There still are several things I do not like but Tae Guk Gi is technically and emotionally engaging overall and above all has the sincerity behind it. 71 Into the Fire has none of these virtues although it has a miraculouslyconsidering the bad script competent performance by T.O.P. a scenerychewing presence of Seungwon Cha and lots of lots of noises and explosions.Right or Left you can't deny that 71 Into the Fire is insultingly paperthin war movie made by hands as inexperienced as these young noble soldiers. You'll probably think that they will be rolling around in their graves for this. Believe me if some of boys in the movie had shouted Wolverine! it would have been much more entertaining. What the hell the movie will make money  that's a depressing thing.".

Prospects for a happy new life after bereavement seems around the corner until she make the mistake of going around checking out real estate properties as if she intends to buy but does not really have the money for. She does that probably to reassure the townspeople that she is financially sound. This unfortunately induced a school bus driver to kidnap her son and when not getting the money he wants kill him.All the above happens in the first hour of the nearly twoandahalfhour movie. The remainder of the movie is devoted to probing Lee's mental state after suffering from this horrible devastating double bereavement.In its skillful storytelling under an easy direction style this movie is one of those my apologies for saying so designed with the aim of fetching the lead actress awards. With resounding success it became instrumental to Jeon Doyeon earning the highly esteemed Cannes best actress earlier this year. A most deserved win I hasten to add.Watching this movie is sometimes like watching Jeon taking a series of tests each one harder than the one before towards winning the highest honour. This starts with a sequence of establishing scenes to show the bonding between the little boy and mother Lee who is sometimes childlike herself in the simplicity of her affection. Then comes the kidnapper's phone call a scene Jeon handles with pitch perfection precision. The scene of victim body identification at the riverside is shot with a combination of distance shot and close ups where Jeon through both facial expression and body language conveys the mother's agonizing journey through shock disbelief and clinging to one last hope.The range of emotions now gets even more complex. There in the painful tearless silence facing her wailing screaming motherinlaw the murdered boy's grandmother and the eerie feeling that her son is still around in the house. Then comes the most difficult part. Quite naturally Lee seeks religious solace through an Evangelistish group. Smile begins to come back to her face as well as a serene peaceful glow until she decides to visit her son's murderer in jail to personally give him her forgiveness. This is probably the awardwinning scene. She holds the flowers she brings to show the prisoner that it signifies her forgiveness. With an even more serene and loving expression the prisoner thanks her and reassured her that since he started serving his jail term he has sought and been granted God's forgiveness. The audience will observe the subtle change in the expression on Lee's face so superbly portrayed by Jeon. Back at the parking lot while her companions on the visit are chatting merrily about how wonderful the transformation of the prisoner has been Jeon remains ominously taciturn. Finally she drops the flowers and murmurs If God has already forgiven him what is there for me to forgive? and sinks on the ground fainting right beside the car. In the remainder of the movie Jeon portrays Lee's heartwrenching struggle between a desire to forgive and an instinct to hate  a performance that earns her a place among the best of the very best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Secret Sunshine 2007 is famous for its awards at the Festival de Cannes in 2007 and other film festivals. JeonDo Yeon who played the newly widowed Shinae won the best actress trophy at the 60th Cannes festival. Secret Sunshine was also a winner of best feature film and JeonDo Yeon received a best actress nod from Asia Pacific Screen Awards. In addition this movie won the best film awards in virtually all Korean film festivals. Masterfully written and directed and uniquely photographed Secret Sunshine expressed the hope and salvation that can be found when life is painful because of continuous tragedy. This film also talked about the forgiveness of God and people. Lee Chang Dong director and writer of this movie said in an interview In a vast sense I wanted to express what love is and this movie could be a melodrama in a sense. Without love we can't talk about hope and salvation. Lee acknowledged that Secret Sunshine had no apparent genre. This movie is not a movie about religion but it drew attention from many Christians in Korea because there were a lot of Christian elements in the movie.The turning point in Secret Sunshine comes when Jun Shinae's son is kidnapped and killed. The kidnapper asks for money because he presumes that since she can buy land she must be rich. Her lie causes much sorrow.Shinae becomes a churchgoer and wants to forgive the murderer. She decides to visit her son's murderer in prison and forgive him. Jongchan Shinae's guy friend says Just forgive in your heart. Do you have to go to the prison? Her church fellows cheer for her and say they will pray for her. Her pastor agrees with what she wants to do. That is a sad moment because it is too early for her to do an action. The result of the meeting with the murderer is another turning point in Shinae's life. The murderer says with a peaceful smile that he has already been forgiven by God. This sparks anger in her toward God. She says How could You forgive the man before I forgive? She begins to fight against God. She looks up to the sky and proclaims I won't lose to You. She becomes a snare her heart is a trap and her hands are chains. It is more bitter than death. She becomes crazier and crazier and is sent to a mental hospital. On the day Shinae is discharged from the hospital she goes to a beauty shop and sees a familiar face. The daughter of her son's murderer works in the shop and cuts her hair. The murderer's daughter has helped kidnapped Shinae's son. While she cuts Shinae's hair the protagonist can't understand what's going on and gets out of the shop quickly.It is difficult not to talk about Jongchan in the movie. Jongchan does his best to be by Shinae's side. Although Shinae doesn't care about him at all he is beside her all the time. Shinae leaves church quickly but Jongchan who started attending church because of Shinae stays there because he feels peace with God. Lee Changdong the director of Secret Sunshine says that Jongchan is like Milyang secret sunshine the rural city or vice versa. He seems to be too secular and frivolous but he is always two steps behind her and takes care of her. Milyang is like him. Mr. Lee adds Someone joked that Jongchan could be an angel. I think that he could be the angel. Who knows? We can't say for sure that there is no angel. If there is a person like Jongchan who forever accompanies his lover's twists and turns we can defend ourselves against the overpowered. The life of Shinae is full of meaninglessness. Her husband died after he cheated on her and her only son was killed cruelly by a murderer after she moved to her husband's hometown. And her soul was damaged because she learned Christianity in a wrong wayand that makes her crazy literally. It is too easy to say that her life is filled with meaninglessness. Does she still have hope in her life? Can she find meaning in her life? The final scene gives us hope. Shinae tries to cut her hair by herself we walk our life's journey by ourselves. She however realizes that it is hard to do it by herself and we know that we can't do everything by ourselves. We see Jongchan holding the mirror for her while she cuts her hair. That's her hope. She has Jongchan beside her and he is willing to help her in whatever situation she is. As I mentioned earlier Jongchan is like an angel for her. If we feel that an angel is always beside and behind us we can find joy in life even though we face adversity in our lives. Secret Sunshine was a hot topic of conversation in Korea. It is like Da Vinci Code. While Da Vinci Code helps us discuss the early church history Secret Sunshine prompts us to deal with life's messiness and find meaning when life seems unbearable. With a shallow interpretation of the movie people misunderstand Christianity and its theology. With a deeper interpretation this movie will help us see beneath the surface. Some people say they quit attending church worship service after they watched Secret Sunshine and Lee Changdong responds by saying They were already antiChrist before they watched this movie. Secret Sunshine is a life story of a woman and we can interpret our life through Shinae's life.".

	schema:reviewBody "A friend of mine who'd watched Milyang on my strong recommendation didn't look so satisfied. Feeling guilty of wasting her time I took a little conversation with her and was somewhat surprised to find that she ended up being a little bit against the main female character ShinAe.In the first scene ShinAe's car has broken down on a highway near Milyang. Her phone call is connected to JongChan a car mechanic who has his own local shop. JongChan's curiosity toward the goodlooking woman tells us she lost her husband recently and decided to move to Milyang for good with her only son Jun. If a handsome male single who meets a pretty widow shows excessive kindness from the very beginning it's not difficult to imagine what he is thinking of her. Because it is my husband's hometown she answers to JongChan's question why she chose Milyang. However it is hard to tell whether she really meant the reason not only because she doesn't look for any links to her husband in town but also because nothing of Milyang seems to comfort her physically or mentally throughout the movie. What kind of place is Milyang? she asks to JongChan looking out the car window. It was her first question in the car fixed and driven by JongChan. ShinAe starts to think about Milyang seriously only after it appears in the eyes long after having decided to leave Seoul for good and even after hours of long winding drives. ShinAe is however confident and spontaneous in starting a new life in a new place but at the same time she resists to be assimilated to her surroundings not to mention JongChan's consistent approach of affection. She is the mother of her son Jun anyway.JongChan's kindness summons not just good wills around her. One twisted mind who runs a kindergarten where Jun is enrolled to kidnaps and kills him to make up money for his gambling debt. ShinAe collapses internally and externally. Her world has been lost. Now she desperately needs a real reason why why she has to suffer so much or the meaning of her pain. Spectators should not give much significance to the specific kind of religion which is Christianity in the movie or its ritual process. Anyone who's been in South Korea would know how common Christian churches are especially in urban areas. So it is more appropriate that ShinAe needed a religious consolation and it happened to be Christianity due to its wider availability in the culture.After a brief period of peace won from participating in religious process waiting for her is one event. One day JongChan drives ShinAe to the prison for her to meet and forgive the killer of her son despite all the discouraging of her religious fellows just because she was so determined to. She looks confident and spontaneous again before entering the interview room but comes out with unimaginable furious. All she says is a repetition of a simple sentence How God can forgive him even before I forgive him? The killer told her that he also found God in jail and was forgiven by him.Now ShinAe seems to desperately try to follow just the opposite of the religious doctrine she learned. She seduces a married man to have sex and even cuts her in the wrist with a knife in a suicide attempt. In that way she thinks she can win against God. Her world is so twisted that her life becomes a chess piece on the board overlooked by a tormenting super power. Meanwhile JongChan who lives a simple life never fails to show up for consistent affection for ShinAe and accepts even the most hysterical behavior of hers as it is without leaving her any moment. The movie ends when ShinAe is cutting her hair by herself in front of a mirror held by JongChan and the secret sunshine falls on a mingled trash in her yard.Milyang is definitely not a movie of vengeance or religious salvation. It is a story of our life where we tumble down and stand up as if on an endless loop. It doesn't matter whether ShinAe saw a possibility of new hope cutting her hair in the yard. I don't care whether ShinAe would marry JongChan or not. I just respect both of her resilience and his consistency in life. Every shot and angle was carefully and beautifully created and woven together by Director Lee ChangDong. This is surely one of his masterpieces.".

	schema:headline " An instantly sobering brutally honest character piece";
	schema:reviewBody "Lee Changdong's exceptional Secret Sunshine is the single most emotionally ravaging experience of the year. It is an instantly sobering brutally honest character piece on the reverberations of loss and a graceful memento mori that resonates with a striking density of thought yet remains as inscrutable as the emotions it observes. Through its layered naturalism and stunningly trenchant view of smalltown dynamics Lee implicitly deconstructs the traditional Korean melodrama by pulling apart the cinematics of excess and ripping to shreds the arcs that shape its characters and grounds the proceedings into a crushing grind of stoic realism.Secret Sunshine remains an immensely compelling fluid work throughout its 142minute runtime. Its bravura first hour is filled to the brim with subtextual insinuations remarkable foreshadowing and adroit reversals of tone brought about by humanistic capriciousness. Adapted from a short story Lee infuses the film with his sensitivity for the sublime paradoxes of life last seen in his transgressively comic and irreverent Oasis. Understanding how personal revolutions are forged when views of our universe are changed Lee not only sees the emotional cataclysm of a widow's sorrow through an inquiring scope but also feels the tumultuous existential currents that underpin the film when religion becomes a narrative scapegoat in comprehending the heinousness of the human experience.Doyeon Jeon's You Are My Sunshine Best Actress accolade at Cannes in 2007 is well deserved. Her performance as the widow Shinae remains an unrelenting enigma. As a character pulled apart by forces beyond her control the sheer magnificence of this performance is central to the film's turbulent nature. With Jeon essaying one cyclonic upheaval after another there's a tremulous sense of collapse that the film to its credit never approaches. Instead it finds a delicate balance that saps the charged theatricality and subsequent banality from ordinary tragedies and its fallouts. She becomes the centre of the film's universe as well as ours. Filmed in glorious handheld CinemaScope the film demolishes the cinematicism of frames and compositions by becoming visually acute just as it is quietly harrowing when the camera never relinquishes its gaze from Shinae through times of happiness guilt and remorse.Lee captures the details of life in the small suspicious town of Miryang  the awkwardness of communal situations its uncomfortable silences and its devastations spun out of personal dramas. Shinae's interactions with the townsfolk rarely inspires dividends especially when they are merely done out of obligation to fit in for the sake of her son Jun Seon Jungyeop. The one recurring acquaintance is Jongchan Song Kangho a bachelor mechanic of uncertain intentions who helps her en route to Miryang in the film's enchanting open sequence set to a captivating stream of sunlight. Song has situated himself as a comedic antihero in South Korea's biggest films but his nuanced lowkey delivery here purports the director's thought process of never having to reveal more than plainly necessary.If pain is ephemeral then grief can never truly dissipate. And Lee finds complexity in subsistence. When Shinae attempts to head down the path of reconciliation only to be faced again with unimaginable heartbreak she unsuccessfully employs the fellowship of evangelical Christianity as a foil to her sorrow.

	onyx:emotionText "Lee Changdong's exceptional Secret Sunshine is the single most emotionally ravaging experience of the year. It is an instantly sobering brutally honest character piece on the reverberations of loss and a graceful memento mori that resonates with a striking density of thought yet remains as inscrutable as the emotions it observes. Through its layered naturalism and stunningly trenchant view of smalltown dynamics Lee implicitly deconstructs the traditional Korean melodrama by pulling apart the cinematics of excess and ripping to shreds the arcs that shape its characters and grounds the proceedings into a crushing grind of stoic realism.Secret Sunshine remains an immensely compelling fluid work throughout its 142minute runtime. Its bravura first hour is filled to the brim with subtextual insinuations remarkable foreshadowing and adroit reversals of tone brought about by humanistic capriciousness. Adapted from a short story Lee infuses the film with his sensitivity for the sublime paradoxes of life last seen in his transgressively comic and irreverent Oasis. Understanding how personal revolutions are forged when views of our universe are changed Lee not only sees the emotional cataclysm of a widow's sorrow through an inquiring scope but also feels the tumultuous existential currents that underpin the film when religion becomes a narrative scapegoat in comprehending the heinousness of the human experience.Doyeon Jeon's You Are My Sunshine Best Actress accolade at Cannes in 2007 is well deserved. Her performance as the widow Shinae remains an unrelenting enigma. As a character pulled apart by forces beyond her control the sheer magnificence of this performance is central to the film's turbulent nature. With Jeon essaying one cyclonic upheaval after another there's a tremulous sense of collapse that the film to its credit never approaches. Instead it finds a delicate balance that saps the charged theatricality and subsequent banality from ordinary tragedies and its fallouts. She becomes the centre of the film's universe as well as ours. Filmed in glorious handheld CinemaScope the film demolishes the cinematicism of frames and compositions by becoming visually acute just as it is quietly harrowing when the camera never relinquishes its gaze from Shinae through times of happiness guilt and remorse.Lee captures the details of life in the small suspicious town of Miryang  the awkwardness of communal situations its uncomfortable silences and its devastations spun out of personal dramas. Shinae's interactions with the townsfolk rarely inspires dividends especially when they are merely done out of obligation to fit in for the sake of her son Jun Seon Jungyeop. The one recurring acquaintance is Jongchan Song Kangho a bachelor mechanic of uncertain intentions who helps her en route to Miryang in the film's enchanting open sequence set to a captivating stream of sunlight. Song has situated himself as a comedic antihero in South Korea's biggest films but his nuanced lowkey delivery here purports the director's thought process of never having to reveal more than plainly necessary.If pain is ephemeral then grief can never truly dissipate. And Lee finds complexity in subsistence. When Shinae attempts to head down the path of reconciliation only to be faced again with unimaginable heartbreak she unsuccessfully employs the fellowship of evangelical Christianity as a foil to her sorrow. But Lee knows better than that when he understands that religion in the context of the human canvas of strife and misery is never a simple solution. But Lee never rebukes the essence of religion as he realises the value of salvation for some through a higher power even if it serves a form of denial in others. The scenes in its latter half which deal with religion doesn't allow itself to become aggressively scornful which is a feat in itself considering how many filmmakers let the momentum of the material take over from what they need to say to be true to its story and characters.Lee's first film since his call to office as his country's Minister of Culture and Tourism is an uncompromising dissertation on human suffering.

	schema:reviewBody "Secret Sunshine reminded me of The Rapture 1991 with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny but this Korean production is a better film. It portrays superreligious Korean Christians in a provincial Korean city and the main character's experiences interacting with them in the wake of a horrible personal tragedy. Shinae is a widowed single mother who moves to the city of Milyang 'Secret Sunshine' in Chinese from Seoul with her young son. She has chosen Milyang because her late husband killed in an auto accident was born there and she feels she needs to make a new start in life in a new place. She does not react well to the overtures of the local Christian zealots one of whose members tries to convince her to come to their church and prayer meetings. Shinae is essentially irreligious and brushes these people off as politely as she can. In fact she brushes just about everyone in Milyang off to begin with but some of them are persistent in trying to invade her world and the consequences are often hilarious. To say more would be to give the film away but it should be noted that the performance of the woman in the lead role Jeon Doyeon is stupendous. Having read that she won the Best Actress award at Cannes in 2007 I expected her to a decent job. But Ms. Jeon is captivating and it is impossible to take your eyes off her when she is on screen. The movie is a sort of harrowing Evelyn Waughesquire piece of work showing how Fate can feel insane as much as strangely inevitable.".

The movie in a word is superlative. It does not deserve the slanderous review that the writer has written. I think the writer has totally missed the point of the movie to a large extent. In fact I too was turned off by the excessive show of Evangelist devotions that occupied the middle of the movie to a large extent. However I must beg to differ with the reviewer in that this movie in the end is not a propaganda piece for evangelist action. I think what the director has shown is that how religion is not enough to find all the answers how religion is to a large extent incapable of providing answers to basic simple questions that one may ask and all that religion has to offer is sometimes just banal platitudes of one kind or another. This does not demonstrate a value judgment on religion as we have to remember that religion is transmuted and expressed by ordinary mostly well meaning basically good people and they usually have no monopoly on truth and thus religion can not in the end provide the ultimate answers to some questions in life. Ultimately it is a matter of faith. You have to take it on faith and that's all. And if you are given to faith then you can appreciate any show of faith. And if you are not given to faith then any show of faith is tiresome. It is thus at the same time instructive to note the reviewer reaction to the movie. In any case the director shows us that one can choose not to accept the religious interpretation of events and answers to questions and in spite of that life goes on and there are 'secret sunshine' in this world that awaits all wounded souls regardless of their religious orientation. And that's just the core message of the film! Please note the last scene of the movie if you don't get this! In the end the movie is a great one and very thought provoking and confronts you  the viewer with questions that you have to answer for yourself. Thus it is a work of art that is challenging to you personally. I do agree with the reviewer in that the Evangelical stuff was a bit too much. However given the above interpretation of religion as shown in the movie I think the director was trying to balance the act whereby he might not be called an Evangelist  basher! The actor Kangho Song was great as always. He's so balanced and just perfect that he's just amazing. He's my favorite Korean actor no doubt. I know the actress Doyeon Jeon got the Cannes award for best actress for this movie. However I did not find any specialty in her acting. It seems that to get awards you just have to act really convincingly in crying and hysterical scenes and all All in all a great movie. If you don't like it  please watch it again and see if you get it! If it leaves you dissatisfied or uncomfortable or asking questions then think if that was not what the director was actually aiming at through this movie in the first place!".

	schema:reviewBody "I just read all 16 reviews of this movie and I feel like no one hit the point at all. I'm writing now worried that perhaps my culture shock will come off in the wrong way. I hope it doesn't. I am profoundly affected by this movie and in need of some catharsis. In the same way as movies like Happiness by Todd Solondz or Punch Drunk Love by P.T. Anderson depict characters that just keep getting more and more awkward and inward lonely and depravedthrough some nameless selfloathing and badluck in the first instance and from the abuse of a family of overbearing sisters and a dreary compartmentalized business in the second instanceI see this movie as depicting the fundamental grotesquery of modern society. I have now spoiled three movies. All three are about big cities where life moves fast and no one cares about anyone.So here is my catharsis. To a person in trauma this is the world. The woman in this movie was free and fun with a song to her voice and a playful nature with her child Jun. When a sick man takes her child for ransom and then kills her she is broken.Now this is how I see it without the goodChristian badChristian banter. No one in the world comforted her. Surely not the man following her around looking for a wife in a widowed woman who outlived her child. I find it sickly disturbing that no review saw him as an unwanted opportunist. The church whether witting or unwitting in this case served the same function. With no one to comfort her she took the fast and necessarily false comforts of a group of strangers and adopted a somewhat schizophrenic supernatural farce always present underneath the eyes in the incredible acting. If spirituality has a place certainly it is not to replace the true empathic care of an actual person.These systems the gossiping women the possesivist patriarchy the sexual repression the evangelical trap the commodification and plastification of the world. All these were the abusers of a woman who could not find solace. She prays she hopes she witnesses more evil she battles God in passiveaggressive schizophrenia she commits suicide she fails. And she gives up.Into the arms of a man that she doesn't love of care about.So it's Korean film. I haven't built up any prejudice against Milyang Korea or the evangelical church. If people can't grieve properly civilization eats them up. All over the world. Society makes us cold and beats us down everywhere. Remember that being human happened before all this did when you think of God. And then remember your Nature.Sick twisted life. Please people. Love each other. Grieve and let grieve. Or the world will eat up the weak and empower the evil.I gave the movie a 5 because if you are watching closely there is a foreboding warning about allowing yourself to be mechanized into any sort of order capitalist religious socionormative. That is what this movie was about. Look again".

I hope it doesn't. I am profoundly affected by this movie and in need of some catharsis. In the same way as movies like Happiness by Todd Solondz or Punch Drunk Love by P.T. Anderson depict characters that just keep getting more and more awkward and inward lonely and depravedthrough some nameless selfloathing and badluck in the first instance and from the abuse of a family of overbearing sisters and a dreary compartmentalized business in the second instanceI see this movie as depicting the fundamental grotesquery of modern society. I have now spoiled three movies. All three are about big cities where life moves fast and no one cares about anyone.So here is my catharsis. To a person in trauma this is the world. The woman in this movie was free and fun with a song to her voice and a playful nature with her child Jun.

It's realistic part is erased by the psychological descriptions of all the phases the poor mother is going through. Denial lost anger faith pert of reality  the movie fallows all the steps the character crosses and looks like a psychological catalog of all the suffering phases a woman can experience.The only thing is to accept what may look like a conceptual experience the woman wears the mask of tragedy the man represents the comical interludes and to let the artifices of the movie touch you. I must say that some parts of the movie really did move me especialy in the beginning particularly those concerning the unability of Chang Joan to truly help the one he loves but also that the accumulation of suffering emotionally tired me towards the end. Nevertheless some cinematographic ideas are really breathtaking and surprising the scene where a body is discovered in a large shot is for instance amazing. This kind of scenes makes Secret Sunshine the melo equivalent of The Host for horror movies or Memories of murder for thrillers. These movies are indeed surprising most original aesthetically incredible and manage to give another dimension to the genres they deal with. The only thing that Secret Sunshine forgets as The host forgot to be scary is to make its audience cry  bad point for a melodrama but good point for a good film.".

It felt like someone running down a checklist of various reactions to grief predictable no surprises no real insight. I didn't even really think Jeon Doyeon's performance was that great despite all the accolades. She does have her moments the scene at the prison is a brilliant piece of facial expression but other times I cringed a bit. I did like the relationship with the eager mechanic Song Kangho who seems to pop up in about half the Korean movies I watch and also the teenage girl. And I liked how evenhanded Lee is in his approach to religion and how the film spends some time with that subject and then moves on. But mostly my reaction was merely lukewarm. Other people whose opinions I respect really like Lee's work but I'm afraid I haven't found the appeal yet.".

The film is finally seeing a release three and a half years after it played at Cannes. It's well worth the wait  it's a near masterpiece. Jeon Doyeon is outstanding as a young widow trying to make a go of it by moving back to her husband's hometown Milyang the actual title of the film which is Mandarin for Secret Sunshine with her five yearold son. It doesn't take long for a second tragedy to strike Jeon which leaves her completely destroyed. The film doesn't go to the expected places. It's all about the pain of grief but it strays far away from melodrama. Jeon discovers Christianity and I expected that she would eventually come face to face with the silence of God a la Ingmar Bergman but even that doesn't happen. Jong Chan a very famous Korean actor whom you may remember from The Host and Thirst has a great role as a lonely mechanic who pesters Jeon for her affection. His character is perfectly balanced between nuisance and pathos. I haven't seen Oasis in years but I recall it being kind of a grandiose melodrama. This is just so subtle and closely observed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Secret Sunshine a 2007 South Korean film is above all else a tale of gaining and then losing faith. It revolves around a nonreligious mother named Sinae whose son Jun is kidnapped and then murdered when the kidnapper was dissatisfied with the ransom. Sinae who already lost her husband is in grief until she takes comfort in Christianity and surprisingly achieves happiness. But when she visits the prison to forgive her son's killer love your enemies she is shaken to hear he has also turned to Christianity and believes God has already forgiven him.The movie doesn't appear to be anything special before the kidnapping. When Jun is kidnapped I was surprised that when Sinae is on the phone with the kidnapper that the audience doesn't hear what he's saying. The movie starts getting more interesting as a tale of faith. I'd have to say I don't quite understand why after all she's been through she comes to think of God as a loving being. She'd have plenty of reason to doubt that. But I totally understand her frustration with her son's murderer being forgiven for his terrible crime before she could have any say in the matter. Anger and frustration with God is I think a sympathetic subject something that Ingmar Bergman explored to a degree although his movies were less about anger than despair with the silence of God. The movie doesn't seem to deny God's existence and I'm not sure it really endorses Sinae's disillusionment but it offers her perspective for consideration. For many Secret Sunshine may be a hard film to take but it shines a light on personal tragedy and a victim's relationship with God.".

She lost her husband and moved to the new town where his husband was born but the another tragic event happened after she settled down. Her only son was kidnapped and killed. The story is about her healing process. Of course she'd never healed but for a while she was healed by religion but another cruel moment was when she'd decided to forgive the murderer and visited the prison where he was at the murderer ironically seemed that he got well claiming that he was healed by religion as well and shamelessly confessed that he had been forgiven by God....that moment was the time she felt the helplessness of religion and became very against it. This movie was really great especially Chandong Lee's skillful acting and her emotional expression when she encountered the real cruelty of religion being a victim's family after she was converted to Christianity was great. Being a victim's family she would be liberated from the murder after she was healed by God and other religious group members. This led her to a composed state of mind and made her decide to forgive the offender. But the thing is isn't it unfair for the victim's family to recognize the offender's recovery who also was relieved by religion and let him just go like that even though she won't forgive him yet. So the question is this what would you say in this situation? The offender should not be forgiven until the victim's family said yes you are now free from the bind forgiven by me not God... Don't you think so?".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Secret Sunshine";
	schema:reviewBody "Initially I would have thought that Secret Sunshine had something critical to say of religion and here being Christianity and wondered if it would be something of a rant against the ills of blind faith or the manipulative power of those who are supposedly holier than thou. Surprisingly it was none of the sort and was largely nonjudgemental putting in place events as a matter of fact and allowing the audience to draw their own judgement and conclusion.And I can't help but to chuckle at the role of Song Kangho a man who's taken a liking for widower Shinae Jeong Doyeon and starts going to church when she does. The reasons for church going are many I suppose either to find inner peace to seek help being afraid of eternal damnation in the fires of Hell to reaffirm faith or even things like wanting to get married in a church or to skirt chase I kid you not. But to each his own reasons for turning up in church every Sunday and participating in prayer groups for fellowship what is indeed dangerous is when the underlying ulterior motives do not get satisfied and that's when frustration sets in. Or when you discover how hypocritical man can be portraying one face inside the house of God and displaying yet another outside.Shinae and her son Jun moves to the town of Miryang which is the birthplace of her deceased husband. Wanting to start life anew she opens up a piano shop to give lessons though in discovering her new found freedom and in a moment's lack of good judgement has another tragedy befall her. And that takes one hour to get to. Secret Sunshine really took its time to get to this point where things then begin to get slightly more interesting with Shinae now taking to embracing religion to deal with and accept her current state reveling in the comfort that religion and fellow believers can offer.What began as crying out for sympathy turns into acceptance and belief that religion offers that silver bullet to solve the ills of all mankind and sometimes you wonder if it's because of your personal myopic view of what the almighty is doing for you that you begin to adopt a somewhat selfish opinion that everything's good going your way and in Shinae's case her magnanimous attitude in wanting to forgive others who had trespassed against her forgetting something very fundamental that it the feeling can cut both ways too.The last act is probably the most fun of the lot as it says plenty where most of us can identify with  why me and why not someone else as we rage against our faith and start questioning unfortunately with no hard and fast answers available. It is then either we fall by the wayside or continue with destructive deeds so rebelliously. But somehow the plug gets carefully pulled in Secret Sunshine so as not to offend and what could have been an ugly character mouthpiece got muted.If you bite into the hype this movie is generating then perhaps you'll realize only Jeong Do yeon's excellent portrayal is worth mentioning as she totally owns her role as the widow Shinae who is probably the most unluckiest person on Earth in having to deal with that many tragedies over a short period of time and if you look at it carefully most of which are of her own doing. Watching her transformation is worth the ticket price and despite having my personal favourite Korean actor Song Kangho in the movie this is something he just breezed right through.".

	schema:headline " A new life gone terribly wrong";
	schema:reviewBody "The most interesting thing about Miryang Secret Sunshine is the actors. Jeon Doyeon as Lee Shinae the main character is a woman with a young son whose husband has died in a tragic accident and who leaves Seoul to live in Miryang which was his home town with her young son. Jeon's face is very changeable. She is girlish flirtatious elegant aged and sad desperate and joyous with it and terribly isolated by turns and it's all in her face. The film also stars Song Kangho as Kim a man who meets her when her car breaks down coming into Miryang who happens to run a garage in town and who follows her around all the time thereafter despite her apparent lack of interest in his attentions. Song is the biggest star in Korea right now renowned for his work with Park Chanwook and Bong Joonho Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance Memories of Murder and The Host. And yet here he plays a throwaway character almost a forgotten man. But of course he makes him interesting and curiously appealing. He is the essential ballast to keep Jeon's character from floating away.Lee Shinae is a piano teacher. She comes to the new town which is a neutral place a kind of poorman's Seoul a town just like anywhere else as Kim says just as he is in a way just like anyone else. Her little boy is sprightly as little boys are but plainly damaged and withdrawn at times too. His father used to snore and when he misses him he lies awake pretending to snore. He goes to school and Shinae meets parents and students and shopkeepers. There is a sense of place in the film even though the place is in a sense anywhere. People speak in the local dialect and everyone knows everything and Shinae's Seoul origin is immediately noticed. Is life really harsher here away from the big city and its sophistication? Shinae seems not to realize the danger she is in.Something terrible happens. And Shinae doesn't necessarily deal with it in the best possible way. But it happens and she must face the consequences. But she can't. She goes to pieces. A perpetrator is caught but that's no consolation. Eventually she becomes so despairing she relents and goes to a bornagain Christian meeting an acquaintance has been pressing her to attend. She finds peace and release with this. But when she decides not only to forgive the perpetrator but to go to the prison to tell him so that experience is full of ironies and it destroys her all over again. She becomes embittered and desperate and she no longer finds solace in religion. And it gets worse than that.Jeon Doyeon gives her all in this extremely demanding and protean role. Lee Changdong may be a very good director. If an actor of the stature of Song Kangho expresses enormous admiration for him that is convincing. According to Scott Foundas of LA Weekly Lee's first three films Green Fish 1997 Peppermint Candy 2000 and Oasis 2002 have marked him out as one of the leading figures of his country's recent cinematic renaissance. But this is not as successful a film as those of other Korean directors whose work I've seen such as Yong SangSoo Bong Joonho and the prodigiously almost perversely gifted Park Chanwook. It may indeed begin as Foundas says as a kind of Asiatic Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore and then abruptly and without warning turns into something of a thriller and some time after that a nearly Bressonian study in human suffering. But that progression not only seems random and indigestible the film sags and loses its momentum toward the end and then simply fizzles out with no sense of an ending. There are also weaknesses in the action. Shinae takes foolish chances with her son and makes bad choices all along. If she is destined for madness like Betty in JeanJacques Beineix's Betty Blue which might explain her peculiar and mistaken choices that isn't something that is properly developed. This is an interesting film certainly a disturbing one but one that leaves one doubtful and dissatisfied after putting one through an emotional wringer.An official selection of the New York Film Festival presented at Lincoln Center 2007an event that has done right by Korean filmmakers in the recent past.".

I'm afraid the ending scene was the beginning of the last nonsolution accepting the pursuit of someone her couldn't relate to and who couldn't understand her.The movie certainly provokes thoughts and the performance of Doyeon Jeon is excellent.The main downside to me is that most of these sufferings are portraited too outwardly and a bit too much. So the movie told me Shinae has gone through all these sufferings because of the crying and screaming. A more effective approach takes the audience to go through the emotions themselves with only a little hint. There are some such moments in the movie her panic upon the ransom phone call her response during the jail visit and putting in the CD at the sermon but they're small in proportion. The problem is with the script and directing not the acting. The second downside is overblowing the character Jong Chan who does not mean much to Shinae and is just there. When casting the famous Kangho Song they have to offer a bigger role. Also everyone loves Kangho Song so no one can appreciate Shinae's reaction to Jong Chan.".

	schema:reviewBody "Going in a different direction from the previous two movies in the series this one took a few chances. The highrise mirrors a new Kanesad what happened to Julian Beck etc. I loved this movie for those reasons. Not saying I didn't enjoy the other two because those were excellent but it seemed like there wasn't anything in there to make them considered a horror movie except for the presence of ghosts with a little bit of suspense. Poltergeist III contained murder suspense tricky camera angles and most of all the best acting I have ever seen from Heather O'Rourke. She was so adorable in her red pajamas and I truly believe she carried the movie with up to par performances by Skeritt Allen Rubenstein Fire Flynn Boyle and Wentz. Her presence on screen while watching this movie is so magnificent and very believable. When I was little she was my first crush and I loved her I only found out on 642005 that she passed away and it crushed me. I say this is the best of the series and I know I am the minority but hey to each his own. I realize the first movie is pretty much legendary for her famous line They're Here but I feel the acting here is better. The way they made the concept of the mirrors work is amazing and I thought it was a great attempt a something new. I gave this movie a 910 because of how much I enjoyed Heather O'Rourke's performance. Check it out.".

The highrise mirrors a new Kanesad what happened to Julian Beck etc. I loved this movie for those reasons. Not saying I didn't enjoy the other two because those were excellent but it seemed like there wasn't anything in there to make them considered a horror movie except for the presence of ghosts with a little bit of suspense. Poltergeist III contained murder suspense tricky camera angles and most of all the best acting I have ever seen from Heather O'Rourke. She was so adorable in her red pajamas and I truly believe she carried the movie with up to par performances by Skeritt Allen Rubenstein Fire Flynn Boyle and Wentz. Her presence on screen while watching this movie is so magnificent and very believable. When I was little she was my first crush and I loved her I only found out on 642005 that she passed away and it crushed me. I say this is the best of the series and I know I am the minority but hey to each his own. I realize the first movie is pretty much legendary for her famous line They're Here but I feel the acting here is better. The way they made the concept of the mirrors work is amazing and I thought it was a great attempt a something new. I gave this movie a 910 because of how much I enjoyed Heather O'Rourke's performance. Check it out.";

I would go literally weeks before I could look at myself in the mirror again... I'd always have to run by them. I used to watch this movie with my friends and it made them equally afraid of mirrors. I'm not going all out to say that the acting was high quality or that it goes down in my books as a classic horror movie but I think it's highly underrated.

Nancy Allen who plays the aunt does not look happy to be involved in this. Weaker entry in the series but it is watchable. Seems a bit rushed.

That is the basic plot and given the fact that Kane and his followers went into the light at the end of the 2nd film having Kane as the main ghost made this film fail.The movie is filled with bad acting and dialogue. Tom Skerritt is just way over the top in his early scenes and gives the worst performance of his career. Nancy Allen doesn't help much and Laura Flynn Boyle was lucky she survived this mess. Then there is the dialogue which many quotes have become part of my daily life in just the sheer silliness of it all. From Give Me The Necklace to I've got the knowledge and the power to the bloated face Tangina saying OutsideIn the movie makes you laugh unintentionally many times. Oh then there is The Puddle!Funny funnierWe wont harm you..we love you. While over the top Zelda Rubinstein is the ONLY saving grace in this film. Her presence brings some of the creepiness that this movie needed. Yes her final scene is pretty bad but here scenes in the middle of the movie are pretty good.Poltergeist III fails on all fronts but mainly due to the fact that it needed a fresh new idea for haunting Carol Anne one more time.".

	onyx:emotionText "Poltergeist III is a bad bad movie but it has a sort of Mystery Science Theater 3000 charm to it.This time Carol Anne is living in Chicago with her Aunt and Uncle to attend a gifted school and the ghosts find her. That is the basic plot and given the fact that Kane and his followers went into the light at the end of the 2nd film having Kane as the main ghost made this film fail.The movie is filled with bad acting and dialogue. Tom Skerritt is just way over the top in his early scenes and gives the worst performance of his career. Nancy Allen doesn't help much and Laura Flynn Boyle was lucky she survived this mess. Then there is the dialogue which many quotes have become part of my daily life in just the sheer silliness of it all. From Give Me The Necklace to I've got the knowledge and the power to the bloated face Tangina saying OutsideIn the movie makes you laugh unintentionally many times. Oh then there is The Puddle!Funny funnierWe wont harm you..we love you. While over the top Zelda Rubinstein is the ONLY saving grace in this film. Her presence brings some of the creepiness that this movie needed. Yes her final scene is pretty bad but here scenes in the middle of the movie are pretty good.Poltergeist III fails on all fronts but mainly due to the fact that it needed a fresh new idea for haunting Carol Anne one more time.";

The third ghost film has Carol Anne living with her uncle and aunt in a skyscraper apartment building of some sort and now goes to a private school for gifted children and has a bald headed psychiatrist who can really test your nerves. OK! Whats up with the obsession with the mirrors in this one! It's an original idea but the villain known as Kane introduced in the better sequel gets on your nerves also as he keeps calling Carol Anne's name over and over and over. That's not spooky that's stupid and annoying. The thing with this one is that it resorts too much to the 80' slasher cliches gore violent disgusting images teenagers acting like fools getting into trouble and very lame dialogue! The first two lacked these qualities which made them good! They avoided the cliches while still being entertaining. This one is about half as entertaining as the first don't get me wrong! it is entertaining at times but not enough! and the ending is rushed and pointless. Check out the critics' slamed reviews and the failing box office numbers. You'll see what I mean!  4 out of 10 I'm being a little generous!".

I can only hope nothing stays with me from THIS abysmal chapter in the series. Not to speak ill of the dead but Heather O'Rourke truly showed her lack of acting chops here. Granted this is the first time in the series she's been expected to really perform beyond 'They're here' and 'They're back'...oh and a LOT of shrieking and she was only 12 at the time but who would build their movie around a performance that would embarrass a porn star? Especially when you have comparative heavyhitters at least for the time like Tom Skerritt Nancy Allen and Lara Flynn Boyle in your cast? Who would do this? Apparently a producerwriterdirectorvisual effects coordinator like Gary Sherman. Less than halfway through this quagmire I realised there was something horribly wrong with the direction nearly every one of the actors delivered their lines as though they'd first seen them that morning the action relied too often on not particularly spectacular special effects and the story offered little sense and less sympathy for any character. I set these problems squarely at the feet of directorcowriter Gary Sherman. I hope he's proud of himself. And whatever happened to Scott the doofy pseudoromantic interest for Lara Flynn Boyle? Not that I care but when you're tying up your loose ends wouldn't you care to at least account for all your 'major' characters and their whereabouts? I guess that's just me... Any reviewer here who would suggest 'Poltergeist III' is in ANY way good needs to see more movies. Perhaps they are suffering under some masshypnotic suggestion projected by the imagination of a manipulative 12yearold girl they've never met. Within the last month my wife and I have viewed all three 'Poltergeist' films. Do yourself a favour and just watch the first.".

By now everyone from the original movie is either dead or they have opted out of their contracts and decided against playing in this third installment.  All except the one little woman and Heather O'Rourke.  Though she would have probably been better off not returning as well because she died of complications from the flu or something during the shoot.  If she could have just been able to rest she might have been able to pull through but I am guessing the movie shoot was just a bit to demanding.  As it is she had to appear in one of the most utterly ridiculous and annoying horror movies ever.  To her credit though she is the least annoying character in the movie as she is one of the few who doesn't yell out CAROL ANNE one hundred times.  This movie has Carol Anne shipped to her aunt and uncle apparently after all they had been through and done for the girl they Carol Anne's parents played by Craig T. Nelson and Joe Beth Williams just could not put up with her anymore. This contradicts the message of part 2 of the family using their love to fight off the evil.  Well not all goes well for Carol Anne in her new settings as the evil old guy from part 2 is back to try and get her played by a different person this time because the other guy died and looking quite stupid I might add.  They live in a skyscraper so it is kind of like Gremlins 2 except not as entertaining.  This one is slow moving and rather boring as there just are not the cool special effects from the previous two installments.  Instead of ghosts we get killer cars and people who are different in mirrors that kill people by pushing them down.  And after this one finally drags itself to the finish you will be left wondering what happened to the poor guy who is seemingly left on the other side.".

I never understood the popularity of the original classic because it is an incredibly clichd immature and oversentimental piece of crap that presumably only had success because Steven Spielberg's name was attached to it. The sequel  unimaginatively entitled The Other Side  is just as dull but for some incomprehensible reason even that film is highly appreciated among horror loving audiences. Poltergeist III however is widely considered as a downright failure and a disgrace to the series. Now I don't intend to be contradictory without reason but personally I actually enjoyed the third part a lot more than the first two parts! This is still an extremely mediocre forgettable and sometimes very dumb spooktale but at least it's not as infantile and whiny than its predecessors.Thanks to the more specific horror expertise of director Gary Sherman Dead  Buried Vice Squad and writer Brian Taggert Visiting Hours Of Unknown Origin Poltergeist III relies more on macabre atmosphere and gruesome effects rather than on expensive lights  lasers shows. The screenplay inventively adds the use of mirrors to generate multiple uncomfortable sequences and the film contains a lot less false scares and pointless boomoments! The Freeling family finally got fed up with all of little CarolAnne unwelcome and irritating ghoststalkers so they send her away to Auntie Patricia and Uncle Bruce in Chicago. They live high up in the ultramodern and hitech skyscraper of which Bruce is the caretaker and CarolAnne attends school in an institution for gifted but emotionally unstable children. It doesn't take long before the Preacher Kane shows his nasty mug in the tower again. He enjoys cracking the mirrors messing with the elevators and icing the luxurious pools but he mainly just keeps nagging for CarolAnne to lead them back into the light. Midgetmedium Zelda Rubinstein to the rescue once again I'm afraid There's a lot of senseless nonsense and too many tedious dialogs in the script but at least this is partially compensated through a handful of creepy moments the possessed cars eerie mirror reflections or the absence hereof. The makeup effects are delightfully tacky and typically 80's including one of the characters bursting through the corpse of another. Heather O'Rourke the young ambassador of the whole series sadly crossed over to the other side herself before the movie was fully completed. Poltergeist III is dedicated to her memory.".

She makes you wanting to protect her and hug her. The music is great and all the other actors especially Zelda Rubinstein are also great. What first confused me is Lara Flynn Boyles character Donna. I thought she is CarolAnn's sister but she is the daughter of Tom Skerrits character and CarolAnn's cousin. Her sister is called Dana.. But strange that Donna looks and acts very much like Dana. The special effects are great and wonderful to look at I hate this computergenerated special effects. The use of the mirror images is fascinating Ah yes and the actors in the mirrors intentionally move a little bit slower than the real actors sometimes this is part of the suspense because the mirror images seem to have a life of their own. Too bad that Zelda dies afterwards she justs comes back from the other side for a moment to help. The Donna creature that crawls out of her body is just a fake Donna as is her boyfriend who came out of the ice as they go back to the mirror world after they killed the psychologist.Anyway this is one of the best and most complex horrormovies I ever saw.".

The setting is awesome a high rise apartment building the mood was creepy and Lara Flynn Boyle is freaking hot. This did what the other two should have done  cut out all that soapy family lovey dovey crap and getting sucked into a stupid TV with spirits that are as scary as my poodle and make a real horror movie. This one has a great plot. I love the idea of people trapped in a building with evil spirits at least in this one those damn spirits DO something SCARY rather than play games like wrapping braces around kids and not hurting them what was that a joke?. I would skip the first two and go straight to this. All you need to know is spirits are following around a little girl. This movie rocks.".

It for me was the song and dance routine with Ewan and Cameron. They were great  fun and charming.This is a movie that I will want to watch again and again.";

It does seem a very strange mess of a movie if you browse thru it or happen to miss a scene while going to the bathroom but I made myself pause it when I needed to and now I seem to get it!!!Part road trip part romantic comedy part wacky comedy part fantasy it's all about how the angel Gabriel Dan Hedaya is getting pressure from the Big Man Himself to arrange love matches that will actually last.Down on earth oblivious to what's going on in heaven a janitor named Robert Ewan McGregor has just been fired and replaced by a robot. His ruthless boss a hysterical Ian Holm refuses to even act apologetic about replacing hardworking men with mindless robots he doesn't have to pay. His reason completely gone Robert kidnaps the spoiled princess daughter of his boss Celine Cameron Diaz and hits the road with her hoping to get his job some money or just an apology!!! This is the kind of film which is perfect when you need something very fluffy and fun with no heaviness. There is some violence one very funny scene involves Delroy Lindo forcing Robert to dig his own grave but it's so funny and comedic that it's not going to fit in with the regular violence in movies like in Die Hard or something.It's a very delightful film for anyone who likes Ewan or Cameron. I think they had great chemistry and the whole movie was just pure fun!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "By reading the comments here you might get an idea that this is a movie which you either love or hate. I disagree. Actually I think the truth is quite the opposite  most likely you will be utterly confused by the movie and be very hard pressed to decide whether you liked it or not.There is a rich girl and a dude with quite a bad luck run going on. The guy kidnaps a girl. There are also some angels whose role isn't clear. A lot of confusing things happen and then the movie ends. With a claymation sequence.Perhaps if they threw out the whole angels angle it would be better. Perhaps the angels are the only thing saving it from being utter dreck. I don't know. That's the most honest comment I can give  I dunno. Much like the angels in question  it seems that even they are not really sure of what are their plans and motivations. But even if I disregard the whole angels and divine intervention stuff sure fact is that the plot just zigs and zags and has more dead ends then Ozzy Osbourne's hair. Right when you think the movie goes somewhere the plot throws another tiring curveball right up to the end. Which you probably will not like. Or will get it and then write essays about it here on the message boards but let's not go there I beg you.For me the biggest complaint is that the movie tries so hard to enter the quite elusive weird but entertaining category and constantly fails. It is at times witty at times trippy at times baffling but never quite reaches the entertainment level it aims for. I can't say I didn't enjoy it at times I really felt I'm loving it but more it went on I couldn't but miss the fact that the creators really didn't have a clue what to do with it or where they wanted it to go. Rewatching further reinforced the fact I had the first time around  the movie's a mess no matter how much it tried to hide it.To sum up this movie is at the same time good and amusing as well as utterly confusing unpolished and tiresome. So in average it is well quite average.510".

Charming Robert can't threaten or write a convincing ransom letter but Celine is such a harpy her condesending and chrulishness towards Robert fail to exude any audience sympathy.

If the plot sounded confused it is because Boyle never seemed to make up his mind what the kind of film he wanted to direct.The stellar cast attempts to save their roles but are handicapped by a screenplay that never quite follows a recognizable genre.

They should have stuck with heroin. What they are trying to achieve here is unclear although I would believe it if they said they just wanted to make True Romance but it had been done already a few years back.A Life Less Ordinary's problems begin with the script and end only with the credits. The characters' motivations reverse themselves from one line to the next. The editing which is either traditional and incompetent or nontraditional and ineffective I couldn't tell. And the plot shifts jerkily and randomly between romantic comedy thriller and 'PulpFiction' ripoff. It's as if the makers sat around with the spinner off an old kiddie game. OK what next?spin violence spin surrealism spin romance. She spin cries spin kisses him spin shoots him. There's no sign that anyone thought even one minute ahead  any idea no matter how irrelevant or disconnected was immediately written in.These poor poor actors. You can almost hear the director telling them You're supposed to be having an argument so just yell each line louder than the last. That's not at all to put the blame on the direction which like the acting must have been an impossible job.Holly Hunter Dan Hedaya and a couple of others are humiliated in a setup plot out of 'Here Comes Mr Jordan' or 'It's a Wonderful Life.' You know the angels with a job to do thing. Their struggle to rescue what must have been an obviously failing vehicle is genuinely depressing to watch.Ewan McGregor as the inexplicably Scottish kidnapper at least manages to come off likable. I think his strategy was to form a casual alliance with bewildered viewers by maintaining an air of complete confusion.Cameron Diaz plays the kidnap victim who comes to enjoy her captivity and collaborate with her captor. Would that audience members could do the same. I didn't recognize her but she was so bad that for a few minutes I thought she might be Madonna. Doubtless I've missed her fine work in other films. If she made no effort at all one could hardly blame her as her character has no consistent qualities or drives being made up of a series of nearly disconnected sketches. She has at least mastered that careful overenunciation typical of models who go into acting a trait that I suspect results from a fear of being labeled as thick. There is one moment when you get a real insight sort of behindthescenes of the acting world. McGregor says his line the camera cuts to Diaz and she hesitates in apparently real confusion then flashes what looks like a smile of relief as she suddenly thinks of a way to deliver her line uh angrily.At the end there's a sort of epilogue in which the completely unconvincing protagonists try to convince you that you've learned a big lesson about love from them while behind them key scenes are replayed in a style that seems calculated to give you a feeling of nostalgia about events that changed you forever just like when you hear Stairway to Heaven. Except in this case they happened on screen within the past two hours and caused only puzzlement.It's hard to understand why this movie isn't simply savaged by every reviewer. I actually walked in without any idea of what it was going to be about who had made it nothing. My only fear based on the title was that it would be a terriblediseaseorhandicap movie.

Actually it is even better in it's own way. Ewan McGregor and Cameron Diaz are probably the best film couple in history of cinema or at least it seems like it to me right now. Althau some people may not understand this film because it's pretty weird and even may appear banal sometimes but it's not.

	schema:reviewBody "Film4 are showing a retrospective season of Danny Boyle movies and this was my first chance to catch A LIFE LESS ORDINARY . I had thought previously THE BEACH was the big Boyle flop but that dubious accolade goes to this movie which has a woefully unfunny script which proves that if a film is good it's down to the director but if it's bad it's down to the screenwriter . 28 DAYS LATER is a rather derivative  contrived screenplay lacking in internal logic and Boyle rises far above it to construct a stylish post apocalyptic dramahorror movie . But it's easy to crank up the thrills and chills in a horror movie . With a comedy it's far more difficult because if the jokes aren't funny then the whole movie fails due to this It's not so much the jokes that are a failure  it's the whole screenplay by John Hodge . It's painfully underdeveloped and reminds you of other films that are slightly superior ones like the Charlie Sheen vehicle THE CHASE or infinitely superior ones like A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH . It's impossible to know why Hodge needed to introduce a fantasy element because the two angels could have easily have been mere mortals though perhaps that might have reminded the audience of the highly regarded Coen brothers . Ironically enough you're still reminded of the Coen brothers regardless and what good screenwriters they are . You're also reminded of those Osamond shows with their cheesy  predictable sketches contain painfully obvious punchlines . For example kidnapper and victim go in to phone box  kidnapper phones victim' s father and in a foul mouth rant describes what he's going to do with victim if he doesn't get the ransom  only to finish by saying  Oh sorry I must have dialled the wrong number  . It's not helped McGregor's natural inability to deliver a comic line and if anyone's laughing at this point they must have changed the channel Boyle is on record as saying that the film in hindsight was  A bit too zany  and it's why it led to its relative box office failure but it's failures are down to reasons I've outlined above . Boyle did make his name with the darkly comical SHALLOW GRAVE and TRAINSPOTTING so he probably wanted to let his creative hair down a bit with a broader comedy that would appeal to an American audience . It shows what a great director he is that both A LIFE LESS ORDINARY and THE BEACH were flops and he was destined for obscurity till 28 DAYS LATER came along".

Their mission is a young man Robert who has been replaced as a cleaner by a robot and the spoilt daughter of his boss Celine.  The two meet as Robert bursts into his boss's office to demand his job back and accidentally ends up kidnapping Celine.  As they go on the run they gradually grow to hate each other less.Following up Trainspotting was never going to be an easy task  but at least they could have at least got near the quality of that film!  In what feels like it wanted to be deliberately quirky the plot involves angels controlling fate to bring two young people together in love.  If it developed this idea in a structured and enjoyable manner then everything would have been fine however as it is it is all over the place and doesn't really make much in the way of sense.  Instead it feels more like a wildly out of control collection of stylish ideas.In terms of narrative it barely hangs together and it creates a problem when it requires us to care for the characters and be part of their romance as in care about it.  It is very appropriate that the end credits features a cartoon of sorts for that is fitting for the level of development that is in the central tale.  The action is silly but not to the point where it gains the imaginative quirkiness of say the Coen brothers.  Instead it is hard to penetrate the film and get involved with it the action is daft and illogical the laughs are rare and the characters are more like cartoon characters than people.  It could have worked  but it doesn't.The cast is good on paper but the lack of material lets them down. McGregor came to fame through Boyle but he gets done no favours here he does stand out as someone who tries hard to make the material work but he can't manage it.  Diaz is good as well but again it's the material given to her that is the problem.  The support cast is better simply because their lack of character and development isn't a problem Lindo is good even if Hunter doesn't really fit in although Holm and Hedaya have OK little cameos.Overall this has energy but it doesn't really hang together in a way that works.  It has touches of imagination and style but mostly it drowns in a sea of quirkiness lacking substance.  It's a shame that such a talented cast and crew didn't have something better to work with  quirkiness for quirkiness' sake is not enough here.".

What happens as a result is that Robert McGregor loses his job home and girlfriend in fairly quick succession and so kidnaps his boss' daughter Celine Diaz. They rather inevitably grow closer and realise that both want a life that is less ordinary than the one they are living.There are moments that are a little strange and wouldn't make sense in the real world but this is movie world!! So try to overlook and accept them and you'll truly love this film! The cast have to be praised as well as everyone of them shines there's real chemistry from the two leads and a really experienced performance from Diaz despite being so early on in her career. Holly Hunter is amazing in it she really delivers a stand out performance and Maury Chaykin as Mr Johnson from up the hill is hilarious!

After all where else would you see two cupids committing lots of violence in order to bring two lovers together? Both Holly Hunter and Delroy Lindo are hilarious as the psychotic cupids. The romance track between the freshly paired Ewan McGregor and Cameron Diaz provides another comedic track. They share a great chemistry making the unusual romance between the fiery Celine and the naive Robert very convincing. There's also a brilliant song sequence in which the two actors display their singing talents and dancing skills. Of course they are supported by talents like Ian Holm and Stanley Tucci who provide excellent comic relief. Hirakubo's sharp editing and Brian Tufano's superb camerawork give the film a slick edge. But it is John Hodge's tight screenplay and Danny Boyle's direction that superbly balances it all together.

The 2 grope their way into romance while fleeing Lindo and Hunter who die numerous times. Trouble is that they can't really die because they're already dead.

The 2 grope their way into romance while fleeing Lindo and Hunter who die numerous times. Trouble is that they can't really die because they're already dead. Such is the same with this terrible film.Everything is so amateurish here. The bank robbery is not exactly what Bonnie and Clyde would have pulled either. Place the reel of this film in the green circular file.";

This is not simply a onedimensional villain that we are so used to seeing in British movies of this period. In addition to a superb reading of the script Laughton is clearly adlibbing in various scenes further breaking down hitherto scrupulously maintained boundaries between audience and actor.

Newton tested for the role and everyone but Goldwyn was thrilled.  Goldwyn though Newton was too ugly to play Heathcliff although everyone else thought he combined the emotional intensity and the black gypsy look that was perfect for that role.  Eventually Laurence Olivier was cast.  He admitted that he always believed his great friend Newton would have been better darker and more naturally dangerous as Heathcliff. I often wonder how Newton's career would have changed had he been given the role of Heathcliff.Hitchcock takes advantage of the dual dangerkindness elements of Newton's personality to create a memorable hero.  A young and lovely Maureen O'Hara is cast as the woman who comes to live with her Aunt after the death of her mother only to discover she is in a den of cutthroats.  She witnesses Newton being hung and just manages to save his life.  Charles Laughton lends his special talent for seeming to one sort of person while actually being something quite different and Hitchcock rolls all these characters and a marvelous Leslie Banks into a fine tumble of thievery and honor love and loyalty crime and punishment.There are many of the familiar Hitchcock touches to move things along.The climax is a bit overthetop but it affords Laughton a marvelous few moments.Jamaica Inn has been remade several times but no one can replace Hitchcock Newton O'Hara and Banks.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even though it is one of the weakest works of Hitchcock the film surprisingly provides rich cinematic flourishes. For a 1939 film it captures on screen the atmosphere and dark mood of the novel quite vividlythe stormy scene the cave and the inn with the name board flapping in the wind. It is another matter that the albino parson of the book is transformed into a squire with an unbelievable eyebrow makeup in the film who commands his steed to be brought inside his dining hall. Daphne du Maurier's novel was adapted for cinema by the trio of Sidney Gilliat Joan Harrison and J.B. Priestley and reportedly the author did not approve of the endproduct.As in many Hitchcock films there is a recurring reference to marriage. Here a good woman remains faithful to her boorish and cruel husband through thick and thin.As in most Hitchcock films there is a lot of sexual innuendo without any sex on screen especially when Pengallen Charles Laughton makes the young girl Maureen O'Hara his prisoner. The only film where Hitchcock showed sex on screen was Frenzy. And as in many a Hitchcock film a bad guy turns out to be a good guy. This is one of the rare films of Hitchcock where the director does not make a cameo appearance.The best cinematic flourishes werethe focus on the thin hands of the 17 year old who cannot be shackled by the soldiers as the handcuffs are too big the opening prayer that serves as a grim introduction and finally the last scene of the film Chadwick the squire's butler who thinks he can hear his dead master calling him for help in death.".

It is another matter that the albino parson of the book is transformed into a squire with an unbelievable eyebrow makeup in the film who commands his steed to be brought inside his dining hall. Daphne du Maurier's novel was adapted for cinema by the trio of Sidney Gilliat Joan Harrison and J.B. Priestley and reportedly the author did not approve of the endproduct.As in many Hitchcock films there is a recurring reference to marriage. Here a good woman remains faithful to her boorish and cruel husband through thick and thin.As in most Hitchcock films there is a lot of sexual innuendo without any sex on screen especially when Pengallen Charles Laughton makes the young girl Maureen O'Hara his prisoner. The only film where Hitchcock showed sex on screen was Frenzy. And as in many a Hitchcock film a bad guy turns out to be a good guy. This is one of the rare films of Hitchcock where the director does not make a cameo appearance.The best cinematic flourishes werethe focus on the thin hands of the 17 year old who cannot be shackled by the soldiers as the handcuffs are too big the opening prayer that serves as a grim introduction and finally the last scene of the film Chadwick the squire's butler who thinks he can hear his dead master calling him for help in death.";

I really liked this movie  I thought the lovely Maureen O'Hara made a very spirited Mary Yellan and Leslie Banks was great as her hulking bully of an Uncle Joss. While not as technically inventive as some of Hitchcock's other work before or since I felt it was made with care and presented a realistic gloomy atmosphere of doom with its endless night time scenes and constant soundtrack of howling winds and crashing waves.And then I read the book...Du Maurier's novel was so different as to bear no relation whatever to Hitchcock's film. The book was intense gritty dark and very moody. Mary Yellan was written almost as she is presented on screen with her sharp Irish wits but Joss is a much more tortured boorish animal than he is in the film. Also the character played by Charles Laughton is absent in the book  or at least Laughton's incarnation is. The squire in the book is one of the good guys and features very little. The film of 'Jamaica Inn' may as well be called the Charles Laughton Show so as to give the actor every chance to overact.See the film if you are a Hitchcock fan and enjoy it for what it is but if you've read and enjoyed the book my advice would be to steer clear!".

O'Hara then flees the room as the men charge up from below.Joining up Newton and O'Hara make their escape to the caves along the shoreline below the inn.  Unfortunately their small row boat is spotted by the thieves who drop a dead body down a small hole onto the pair. Distracted the row boat slips off the shore and floats away leaving O'Hara and Newton stranded in the cave. As the pair's boat drifts off with the tide the thieves ready a boat themselves.

When she has gone Newton reveals that he is actually a lawman an officer in the Royal Navy who has been dispatched to uncover the thieves and bring them to justice.  He suspected that there was another man behind the capers someone who was sending the thieves information about what ships to lure and at what time but he hadn't learned who that was.  The nobleman played by Charles Laughton offers to help and they both grab their pistols and charge off to the Jamaica Inn to arrest O'Hara's aunt uncle and the theives for piracy.

As with most Alfred Hitchcock films the plot turns with each moment.If I were a young filmmaker looking for a solid project I'd remake this film casting Anthony Hopkins as the nobleman.  I'm not sure who I would want to play Maureen O'Hara's character.  O'Hara was a treasure who isn't easily matched even in the 60 years since this film was originally released!".

This is a fantastic box set that contains all as far as I know of his films from the U.K pre 1940. I had never seen Jamaica Inn and greatly looked forward to the experience  if only for the first oddball pairing of Charles Laughton and Maureen O'Hara who were both soon to be immortalized in The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Hitchcock is unable to disappoint his audience. What we find here is a spooky tale set in Cornwall in the early 19th Century based loosely on a novel by Daphne Du Maurier  who goes uncredited. Story features a murderous gang of hoodlums who prey upon ships that seek shelter in a nearby harbor during hazardous storms. The films opens with an exciting sequence depicting this activity which functions almost as a prologue to everything that follows and really draws the audience into the story. Disturbing dark and frightening as this prologue is one can only wonder what will follow.Next in scenes perhaps inspired by Tod Browning's Dracula a careening carriage whisks young Maureen O'Hara through the pitch black night. She insists that the driver deliver her to the Jamaica Inn but he outright refuses to do so and speeds right by the place. He lets her off nearby at the home of one Squire Pengallon who he says will care for her. The haughty squire is played of course by Charles Laughton who employs his unctuous charm to reassure the nonplussed O'Hara that all will be all right and that he will escort her to her Aunt and Uncle at Jamaica Inn. Maureen O'Hara soon discovers that her Uncle functions as the ringleader of the gang and her abused but devoted Aunt is an enabler to his illicit lifestyle.From what I've read Hitchcock wasn't too fond of this film and didn't care for the direction Laughton took with his character. Nevertheless Laughton remains fascinating to watch as much of a ham as he is. His Squire registers as somewhat of a pathetic and yet supremely conceited character and the ultimate revelation of what he's capable of comes as a real stunner. O'Hara is of course beautiful and feisty as demonstrates that she has much more heart than just any glamorous young girl posing prettily for the camera.A special mention should go to Emlyn Williams who plays a despicable but magnetic ringleader of the cutthroat gang. I was really surprised and entertained by his contemporary attitude and swagger which wouldn't seem outofplace in a movie from the 21st Century.So a minor Hitchcock certainly but also as good a thriller as anyone else was making at the time. out of ".

	schema:headline " unusual early Hitchcock film";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure if I can explain the low rating of this film overall on IMDb because I thought it was a remarkable actionsuspense film full of excellent actors and unforgettable moments. You've got the screen debut of Maureen O'Hara who's playing a young woman who gets involved with a group of pirates when she travels from Ireland to England to stay with her aunt Patience Marie Ney and her abusive husband Joss Leslie Banks. Very quickly we find out that the local magistrate Sir Humphrey Charles Laughton is the mastermind behind their scheme of tricking ships into wrecking on the shores of Cornwall murdering the sailors and stealing their cargo. She befriends a young pirate Robert Newton who the others want to hang for skimming the take and together they set about trying to prevent another robbery.The story itself is very interesting and takes us to a location and period in English history that we don't hear much about. There's a wonderful seedy quality to the clothing of the pirates and the locations they inhabit. Hitchcock and his writers seem infatuated with the lifestyle of the thugs. The story is from a book by Daphne Du Maurier who was apparently one of Hitchcock's favorite authors he also did films of her Rebecca and The Birds both much more well known than this film. Unfortunately a lot of the story elements are very predictable  Laughton's behavior from the very beginning is far from the gentleman who O'Hara seems to take him for rather naively even though she's seen him toss a bag of coins to his compatriots after losing a bet on her beauty. I suppose on a certain level the film is a warning about the deception of appearances  Joss starts to seem like a more sympathetic character than Sir Humphrey especially when he essentially sacrifices himself for Mary O'Hara towards the end. This is fairly standard melodrama  you have an impossible love between the aunt and the uncle the conventions of melodrama not to mention the PCA will not allow him to escape punishment for his crimes but his love for his wife is true so the writer allows him to make the sacrifice so that this conflict will resolve itself in a way that satisfies the audience. All through the film there's a hint that Joss might be sexually interested in Mary. Only in the act of sacrifice does he reveal his real nature.But then the film has yet another surprise for us  Laughton's character becomes more and more irrational until we reach a point by the end where Mary realizes along with the rest of us that he's actually completely insane. This is revealed largely through the relationship between Sir Humphrey and his manservant Chadwick Horace Hodges one that has vague homoerotic connotations possibly just a fanciful invention of Laughton though Hitchcock couldn't have failed to have noticed it. Touchingly Sir Humphrey bids another servant to watch over Chadwick after he leaves because he's worried about the other man's mental health! That's just one of the examples of offbeat humor that Hitchcock employs in this film often using the humor to offset and relieve the intensity of the suspense. For example when James Newton has gathered the troops and is trying to arrest Sir Humphrey he stops by Sir Humphrey's estate just long enough for one of his foppish hangerson to comment hey you're wearing my uniform! I couldn't say I noticed any other typical director's touches except the pan that reveals Laughton as the collaborator. I'm not a huge expert on Hitchcock in particular though but I have noticed the humor involved in his suspense scenes a device he also used in The Lady Vanishes and all the way through North by Northwest. The performances are all solid. I liked what O'Hara was able to do with her eyes after Laughton tied her mouth up she was clearly naturally talented as a screen actress. Laughton is always tough to assess because he likes to play around so much and have so much fun inhabiting the role that it sometimes damages his performance and he was a guy with a world of talent.... so much so that it seems like he gets bored with it and does other things sometimes things that work and sometimes things that don't. I'd say this film is a 7 or 8 out of 10 on the Laughton scale. He's sufficiently creepy in the early scenes and his playfulness works nicely with the madman angle that the writers wanted to take towards the end. Leslie Banks' work in the film was probably the most impressive in my opinion because he also had the broadest character to work with and managed to make this character work as a human being.Certainly an exceptional British film from the period giving us a rather unusual story filmed with great skill and played by a group of talented actors.".

You've got the screen debut of Maureen O'Hara who's playing a young woman who gets involved with a group of pirates when she travels from Ireland to England to stay with her aunt Patience Marie Ney and her abusive husband Joss Leslie Banks. Very quickly we find out that the local magistrate Sir Humphrey Charles Laughton is the mastermind behind their scheme of tricking ships into wrecking on the shores of Cornwall murdering the sailors and stealing their cargo. She befriends a young pirate Robert Newton who the others want to hang for skimming the take and together they set about trying to prevent another robbery.The story itself is very interesting and takes us to a location and period in English history that we don't hear much about. There's a wonderful seedy quality to the clothing of the pirates and the locations they inhabit. Hitchcock and his writers seem infatuated with the lifestyle of the thugs. The story is from a book by Daphne Du Maurier who was apparently one of Hitchcock's favorite authors he also did films of her Rebecca and The Birds both much more well known than this film. Unfortunately a lot of the story elements are very predictable  Laughton's behavior from the very beginning is far from the gentleman who O'Hara seems to take him for rather naively even though she's seen him toss a bag of coins to his compatriots after losing a bet on her beauty. I suppose on a certain level the film is a warning about the deception of appearances  Joss starts to seem like a more sympathetic character than Sir Humphrey especially when he essentially sacrifices himself for Mary O'Hara towards the end. This is fairly standard melodrama  you have an impossible love between the aunt and the uncle the conventions of melodrama not to mention the PCA will not allow him to escape punishment for his crimes but his love for his wife is true so the writer allows him to make the sacrifice so that this conflict will resolve itself in a way that satisfies the audience. All through the film there's a hint that Joss might be sexually interested in Mary. Only in the act of sacrifice does he reveal his real nature.But then the film has yet another surprise for us  Laughton's character becomes more and more irrational until we reach a point by the end where Mary realizes along with the rest of us that he's actually completely insane. This is revealed largely through the relationship between Sir Humphrey and his manservant Chadwick Horace Hodges one that has vague homoerotic connotations possibly just a fanciful invention of Laughton though Hitchcock couldn't have failed to have noticed it. Touchingly Sir Humphrey bids another servant to watch over Chadwick after he leaves because he's worried about the other man's mental health! That's just one of the examples of offbeat humor that Hitchcock employs in this film often using the humor to offset and relieve the intensity of the suspense. For example when James Newton has gathered the troops and is trying to arrest Sir Humphrey he stops by Sir Humphrey's estate just long enough for one of his foppish hangerson to comment hey you're wearing my uniform! I couldn't say I noticed any other typical director's touches except the pan that reveals Laughton as the collaborator. I'm not a huge expert on Hitchcock in particular though but I have noticed the humor involved in his suspense scenes a device he also used in The Lady Vanishes and all the way through North by Northwest. The performances are all solid. I liked what O'Hara was able to do with her eyes after Laughton tied her mouth up she was clearly naturally talented as a screen actress. Laughton is always tough to assess because he likes to play around so much and have so much fun inhabiting the role that it sometimes damages his performance and he was a guy with a world of talent.... so much so that it seems like he gets bored with it and does other things sometimes things that work and sometimes things that don't. I'd say this film is a 7 or 8 out of 10 on the Laughton scale. He's sufficiently creepy in the early scenes and his playfulness works nicely with the madman angle that the writers wanted to take towards the end. Leslie Banks' work in the film was probably the most impressive in my opinion because he also had the broadest character to work with and managed to make this character work as a human being.Certainly an exceptional British film from the period giving us a rather unusual story filmed with great skill and played by a group of talented actors.";

	schema:headline " Connoisseurs of ripe acting may enjoy this one. Laughton outdoes Laughton as Sir Humphrey Pengallan";
	schema:reviewBody "If sinking your teeth into overripe fruit is one of your pleasures then Jamaica Inn should be your dish. It features one of the ripest and most ludicrous performances I've ever seen from Charles Laughton as Sir Humphrey Pengallan and that covers a lot of territory. As the squire who is the fullfigured mastermind behind a gang of murderous wreckers on the Cornish coast Laughton sports the latest dandyish fashions a false nose false eyebrows which almost have lives of their own a carefully coifed combover a piggish overbite and line readings that would make Bette Davis at her most mannered envious. Close behind in the ripe playing sweepstakes is Robert Newton as Jem Trehearne law officer and hero who roles his eyes almost as much as Laughton and Leslie Banks as Joss Merlyn the leader of the gang and the owner of Jamaica Inn. The only person who manages reasonably well is Maureen O'Hara who plays Mary the plucky and beautiful niece of Merlyn's wife. Even she is largely confined to earnestly crying out for decency and screaming. Don't get me wrong. Jamaica Inn is so overthetop it's a delight to watch especially when Laughton is chewing the scenery. Hitchcock making his last movie in England before leaving for the United States supposedly became so bored during filming that he didn't care what the actors did. The story is a bodiceripper by Daphne de Maurier in fact Maureen O'Hara's bodice gets ripped not once but twice. The time is about 1800. The place is Cornwall on the rocky coast. Jamaica Inn is a stone hulk of a building close by the warning light that shows ships where to avoid the rocks in the stormy seas. Someone with advance knowledge of ships with rich cargoes has been blocking the warning light. When the ships founder wreckers work their way to the ships slaughter all the sailors and take the cargo. Merlyn and his gang are the heavies but who is the mastermind? Then young Mary whose parents have died shows up late one night at Jamaica Inn's doorstep to be taken in my her aunt Merlyn's wife. At the same time we learn that the gang has a ringer in its midst an officer of the law determined to bring justice to Cornwall and identify the mastermind. We also learn this is no spoiler we find out very early in the movie that the mastermind is the effete mannered Sir Humphrey. It all comes together with madness and murder on the wind switching from Jamaica Inn and the rainswept coast to Sir Henry's elegant mansion and his imperious demands. Listen Merlyn Sir Humphrey says I want money. I know what to do with money when I have it which is why I must have it. Do you understand? I must have it! The movie looks great. There are crashing seas stormy nights and coaches drawn by galloping horses. Jamaica Inn itself has that detailed threatening look that Hitchcock achieved with the wind mill in Foreign Correspondent. Stone stairways go up and down nothing fits well shutters rattle in the wind. The scenery chewing isn't confined to the leads either. The gang members get their moments too especially Emlyn Williams as Harry an invariably cheery and dirty young man with a knife. The movie rises or falls however not on Hitchcock but on Laughton...and Laughton is so ripe he's spellbinding. You have to see him to appreciate his way with these words spoken to a bound and gagged Mary We may be going a long way you know. Nearer the sun of course...the Isles of Greece. You're thinking that'll cost money but I have enough. One must have enough. I always knew that to live like a gentleman spaciously and with elegance one must have money...and a few beautiful possessions of course like you my deah. Sir Humphrey's last words bring the movie to a satisfyingly ornate ending Make way for Pengallan!".

I settled back on a familiar settee late one night  after a meal at the finest Indian restaurant I know Ocean Rd. South Shields and after watching the heartening second Office Christmas Special  to play this film on DVD a Christmas present from a good friend. Ironies are even in that I bought him a DVD of the 1962 Robert Mulligandirected To Kill A Mockingbird both that Harper Lee novel and Daphne Du Maurier's Jamaica Inn were texts we studied at school in our English lessons. They were by far the most enjoyable of the texts we studied in those five years  though I admit a partiality for Cider With Rosie and Jane Eyre. It was all for the better that I knew little of what this film was like I knew only that it was directed by Mr Hitchcock and differed quite a lot from the book. Oh and how it does differ!Quite frankly Hitchcock's Jamaica Inn is a different thing altogether to that utterly splendid barnstorming tale of smuggling. This misses the uncanny eerie quality of Du Maurier's plotting and characterisation. Here Joss Merlyn is only a slight reprobate he is softened and thoroughly reduced in size and dimensions compared to Du Maurier's conception of him in her novel. There Joss was a towering bullish walkingtalking threat of a man. Leslie Banks sadly fails to capture any of the preposterous swaggering bravado of the Joss Merlyn forever etched into my mind.That is really the biggest failing in writing casting or such like. The more general approach too fails to ignite the conceptualisation of a desolate Cornish coast is reasonable but unspectacular. there's never quite enough misty frightening or frightened atmosphere one does not get enough sense of things being at stake as they were in the novel life and death hell for leather. A further bone to pick is certainly the strangely wimpy portrayals of the crew of cutthroats and local degenerates another failure of conception. Maureen O'Hara... well the damsel is feisty to an effective degree and acquits herself well though is oddly overmannered at times. It is an odd performance that is half very effective and half ineffectual. Now Robert Newton that wonderfully hammy actor of renown is excellent here as the dashing Jem Merlyn figure. He is one of the few performers to seem as if he is on anything like the same wavelength as Charles Laughton.Charles Laughton? Well he absolutely strides away with this film and that is no understatement. This is so to such an extent that his own vision overwhelms whatever there may have been of Hitchcock's or indeed Du Maurier's. He plays Sir Humphrey Penhalligon  standing in effectively for the novel's eerie albino vicar Francis Davey  a thoroughly sneaky grandiose aristocrat who is quite wonderfully playing the people of his county for outright fools. He doesn't so much as administer justice as pick and choose allies and inevitably seek to further his own ends. Sir Humphrey's condescending subtle contempt for those around him sublimely passes the other characters by while the audience is in on it. One feels entirely complicit in the seemingly jovial fellow's gleeful tricks and crimes Laughton almost tangibly winks at the audience with his every sideways glance and jocund intonation. What Victorian Melodrama villainy is in the man here implicitly sending up the limitations of all that is around him by claiming the centre of attention and having so much comedic fun from his privileged position. It completely unbalances any chance of us finding the wrecking that serious as he is an obvious villain from the start and unlike the otherworldly Francis Davey Penhalligon is someone we can relate to. His intentions are selfish but born of a paternalistic High Toryism the character is manifestly a cultural and social elitist. He does not want to destroy the existing world but to be happy in it. Only of course his methods and complete disregard for others are 'not the way to go about it' tuttut!The ending simply lives up to what has become a Laughton picture the narrative of the novel has been almost wholly jettisoned by this juncture and our  or mine anyway  interest in solely in hoping that the wicked Sir Humphrey will get away with his arrant errant audacity. Suffice to say Mary Yellan is not in our minds in the final frames which are beautifully melodramatic and distinctly odd.I can only conclude by saying just how much I enjoyed watching this film late that night recently... It was glorious fun entirely due to the magnificent Charles Laughton. It is awful overall if one is looking for a Jamaica Inn close to Du Maurier's great original but one actor manages to steal the fairly creaky show and catapult it off onto a higher stage. Oh there's no internal consistency here but that's part of the delight! A partmarvellous fudge of a film at least never dull due to Laughton.".

	schema:headline " Somewhat Interesting But Lesser Hitchcock";
	schema:reviewBody "While Hitchcock's adaptation of Daphne Du Maurier's Jamaica Inn has some interesting features overall it deserves its reputation as one of the great director's lesser efforts.  While it has some good moments and a good performance by Maureen O'Hara it is rather clunky and often implausible.The story holds some possibilities.  At the beginning we find out that there is an old inn along the coast of Cornwall which serves as the meeting place for a gang of criminals who deliberately cause shipwrecks and then rob and kill the survivors.  O'Hara is the niece of the innkeepers who comes to stay with them and then gradually discovers the inn's sinister secrets.  This gives rise to a melodramatic series of chases escapes and showdowns in the inn and along the nearby seacoast.Unfortunately the pacing is quite irregular and often too slow and some of the more fastpaced scenes sometimes seem implausible.  Just as one example there are too many times when someone slips away solely because whoever is doing the chasing forgets to look in a rather obvious place.  There are also not enough interesting characters.  O'Hara is good and Charles Laughton is entertaining as Sir Humphrey.  But Laughton overplays his role for all it is worth and he swallows up most of the other characters.  There are some pretty good actors in the rest of the cast who just don't get very much to do.There are still some interesting developments and a couple of decent twists.  Hitchcock fans will probably still want to see Jamaica Inn at least once.  But it is hardly one of the director's better films and not really good enough to be of more general interest.".

This gives rise to a melodramatic series of chases escapes and showdowns in the inn and along the nearby seacoast.Unfortunately the pacing is quite irregular and often too slow and some of the more fastpaced scenes sometimes seem implausible.  Just as one example there are too many times when someone slips away solely because whoever is doing the chasing forgets to look in a rather obvious place.  There are also not enough interesting characters.  O'Hara is good and Charles Laughton is entertaining as Sir Humphrey.  But Laughton overplays his role for all it is worth and he swallows up most of the other characters.  There are some pretty good actors in the rest of the cast who just don't get very much to do.There are still some interesting developments and a couple of decent twists.  Hitchcock fans will probably still want to see Jamaica Inn at least once.  But it is hardly one of the director's better films and not really good enough to be of more general interest.";

Which may be true I didn't read the book. I thought there was plenty of suspense.

Is it the most suspenseful movie I ever saw? No. But then again I said that I liked it. I didn't say that I loved it. It was an OK movie. I was expecting a mediocretogood movie and I wasn't disappointed. As for mood and atmosphere it was fine. So it's not as moody and dark as the book. Get over it. Wow this is less of a review and more of me lashing out at the fans of the book. All in all the movie is fine. I recommend it to fans of Hitchcock. Some people complained about his directing in this one. It was his last film before he went to Hollywood and apparently actor Charles Laughton who was also the producer didn't listen to Hitchcock on the set and did his own thing which caused Hitchcock to say Screw it. and just coast through. So I agree this isn't up to par with his usual direction however it ain't bad either. I mean even when he sorta gives up it still turns out OK. So just watch with your expectations low so your not disappointed.".

There's no two ways about his wickedness he's a perfect cad  just catch the way he sizes up Maureen O'Hara's character when she first makes her appearance at his home. And oh those eyebrows!  you'll marvel at the makeup job that just adds to the extreme of Laughton's over acting. Oh and one other thing  it's hard to understand what he's saying sometimes but he's so entertaining in the delivery that you just don't seem to mind so much.The story itself deals with a band of cutthroats thieves and smugglers on the Cornish Coast of England while the dark and moody atmosphere of the picture gives it the feel of a pirate film that mostly takes place on land. Laughton's Pengallan is the mastermind that pulls the strings on waylaying ships to their doom on the stormy coastline. Robert Newton appears as the antipirate in this one and after narrowly escaping death at the hands of Joss Merlyn's Leslie Banks rowdy bunch he takes charge to bring Pengallan to his ultimate demise.Here's something to keep an eye out for. After Trehearne Newton and Mary O'Hara escape from the villains by swimming out to their boat they wind up seeking refuge at Pengallan's home. While still in his soaking clothes Trehearne pulls a dry folded piece of paper from his pocket. How'd he do that?As most of the comments on this board suggest the film deserves a chance even if it doesn't hold up well for the professional critics. The best way to view it would probably be late at night with a nice warm brandy to take off the evening chill. A dark and stormy night would do just fine in keeping with the on screen atmosphere. I think Pengallan would agree.".

	schema:headline " Not a real Hitchcock more like a real Laughton";
	schema:reviewBody "JAMAICA INN is one of the Hitchcock films which might be said not to be a Hitchcock film. Its not that one or two 'Hitchcockian' elements are missing but almost all are missing. JAMAICA INN is adapted from a Daphne Du Maurier novel and was his last English film. Hitchcock's next film and his first American film would be REBECCA also from a Du Maurier novel. He would later go on to direct another film from a Du Maurier original THE BIRDS so there is no incompatibility there. The writers were the usual Hitchcock suspects from his English period. Frequent collaborator Sidney Gilliat and long serving Joan Harrison later the producer of Hitch's TV show as well as wife Alma Reville were credited along with J.B. Priestly who gets an additional dialogue credit.The villain of the piece Charles Laughton as the unlikely Sir Humphrey Pengallan the local magistrate on the Cornish coast is revealed almost immediately. The hero however is obscured for the first reel. The film is built around Laughton and he chews the scenery most wonderfully. It is essentially his picture the producer Erich Pommer a German refugee and one of the founders of famous UFA studios was Laughton's house producer. Priestly must have been brought in to goose up Laughton's dialogue. Another factor making this film sort of the antiHitchcock is the lack of humor whether provided by the situation or the mixing of classes. Laughton is funny in a way though he could have been funnier if he had gone completely over the top. As such there is a bit too much naturalism in Laughton's portrait of a Regency rake straight from the Hellfire Club gone to seed and off his head with greed rather like the last panel in a Hogarth series of etchings. While Hitchcock villains could be unspeakably cruel they always had a modicum of wit to go along with it.Think of Otto Kruger in SABOTEUR and most especially James Mason in NORTH BY NORTHWEST issuing the foulest threats is the most cultured and dulcet tones. Laughton never gets this type of exchange going  from NORTH BY NORTHWEST Roger Thornhill Apparently the only performance that will satisfy you is when I play dead. Phillip Vandamm Your very next role and you'll be quite convincing I assure you.For all his facial gymnastics Laughton is pretty straight forward a villain with only his position to throw people off the scent something else the real Hitchcock would have found very amusing.Hitchcock even uses terrible screen clichs without even a special twist or variation on them. Usually Hitchcock will use the audiences expectations to his own advantage. There is the one where some one is about to mention the name of the murderervillaininchief and just as they are about to speak the name a shot rings out and they fall over dead and mute forever. In this case it doesn't even make sense as everyone knows who the villain is but its used anyway because it is always used in this sort of picture. In Charlie Chan pictures it's usually preceded by Number one or number two son exclaiming Look pop the lights are flickering and then blam! the stoolie doesn't get to spill the beans after all and we have another twenty minutes of film for sure. Its as if Hitchcock really just doesn't care.There is one moment where the film is lifted into the territory rare and wild that bears the special attentions of Hitchcock. I'm sorry to say that it concerns bondage and sadism. The scene has Laughton first gaging Maureen O'Hara and then tying her hands behind her back. It is so effective not because of its graphic nature but because Laughton tells O'Hara what he is going to do before he does it. With the white silken gage pulled taught in her mouth he drapes a hood over her head so that she begins to look like the Virgin Mary bound and gaged. The photography is particularly Germanic here Pommer and Hitchcock had made THE PLEASURE GARDEN his first complete film together in the silent days and I was reminded not only of the Virgin but as a Munch like Virgin with her face frozen in anxiety and also the Good Maria from Metropolis. It is a scene which pops out from the rest of the hectic goings on of the rest of the film.Since its not very good Hitchcock it is rarely shown. Even in this sub genre it is outclassed by Fritz Lang's MOONFLEET or even De Mille's very silly REAP THE WILD WIND. JAMAICA INN was just as John Ford used to put it a job of work and Hitch was off to America. Seeing this film made me want to dig out one of my copies of Truffaut's extensive interview with Hitchcock to see what he had to say on the matter. He was usually brief when discussing terrible failures like JAMAICA INN. In sum it is not a Hitchcock film but a Laughton one.".

The dialogue seemed straight out of A Clockwork Orange as if both films take place in the same alternate universe. One character in particular sounded like one of Alex's droogs. Coupled with this fantastic dialogue was one of my top ten favorite villains in movie history. Charles Laughton chewed the ! out of the scenery in this role with betterthanperfect comic timing and a villainous role straight out of an exploitation film. While not technically an exploitation film I think you could only get into it by watching it in the same way you would watch an exploitation film otherwise you probably wouldn't 'get it' and think it was just some early undeveloped Hitch film. For example I thought the last 10 minutes or so of Laughton kidnapping Maureen O'Hara's character was just a 1930's metaphorical way of filming an exploitation rape scene. Just watch the way Laughton does the most insanely despicable things and seems to have the most blas and yet innocently boyish fun doing it. Play this in the middle of a triple bill of 1970's exploitation films and it would feel right at home. Probably the only way to watch it. Viewing this instead as most people do as Hitchcockindevelopment will probably only lead to disappointment as can be seen from other user comments.".

It's a period thriller light on thrills about a gang of criminals who cause shipwrecks on the coast in order to steal the cargo and kill the surviving crew.

Laughton is usually cited as one of the main reasons why this movie is so flawed. Laughton was one of the producers on the film and evidently interfered with Hitchcock at every turn. Without even knowing the story behind the production it's easy to lay primary blame at Laughton's doorstep while watching this. He's over the top and campy often comical to the point that it's impossible for Hitchcock to effectively build any suspense. There are some nice atmospheric moments with howling winds and stormy nights and the like. But the atmosphere is undone by Laughton's ridiculousness. The unconvincing makeup and fake nose don't help. The rest of the cast isn't that much better with master ham Leslie Banks overacting as much as possible and a stiff Maureen O'Hara as the heroine. Maureen's as lovely as ever but this being one of her earliest roles her acting is pretty limited. It's a flawed movie with many boring stretches too much bad acting and mysteries that are not very mysterious. Still it's Hitchcock so there are enough interesting things going on to warrant a look.

	schema:reviewBody "Three or so years ago I was under the notion that Alfred Hitchcock had never made a bad film. Admittedly that would be true if I had seen every film of his truth is at the time I had not and maybe I was rather biased as Hitchcock is my favourite director. While he still is I do think he has done some bad and disappointing films but none of them are completely and utterly terrible. Jamaica Inn is perhaps the weakest he did but I still consider it a disappointing one considering the talent rather than terrible. Of course there are good points Robert Newton in a role that couldn't be more different from his performances in Oliver Twist and Treasure Island is an understated and likable hero Emlyn Williams is sinister with some droll lines and delivery there is some nice scenery and the opening shipwreck and ending are exciting.Maureen O'Hara in her debutgood historical point is gorgeous to watch but rather shrill and wooden and most of the supporting cast is stagy. People will remember the character of Pengallen and will love Charles Laughton as him but I found him so overthetop with little attempt to reign in that it harmed the film and seemed as though he was acting for a completely different film. I know Laughton can be hammy and subtle at the same time he was brilliant in The Paradine Casealso directed by Hitchcock where his role was much more interesting than here and Mutiny on the Bounty and Witness for the ProsecutionnonHitchcock films were the same. Pengallen is a creepy character sure but rather onedimensional. The rest of the characters are also sketchily drawn.And as much as I love and admire Hitchcock it did seem as though his heart wasn't in it it is an unusually pedestrian directing job and has little of his trademarkdistinctive directing touches. I'd go as far to say that Jamaica Inn didn't seem like a Hitchcock film but more a Laughton one that's how much he and his character dominated the film and doing it that way it came at the expense of everything else. The editing lacks finesse in regard to editing Jamaica Inn is the least welledited while the dialogue is stilted and the story tediously paced and confused. The makeup especially for Laughton is garish. Overall has its good points but for me Hitchcock's weakest. 410 Bethany Cox".

People will remember the character of Pengallen and will love Charles Laughton as him but I found him so overthetop with little attempt to reign in that it harmed the film and seemed as though he was acting for a completely different film. I know Laughton can be hammy and subtle at the same time he was brilliant in The Paradine Casealso directed by Hitchcock where his role was much more interesting than here and Mutiny on the Bounty and Witness for the ProsecutionnonHitchcock films were the same. Pengallen is a creepy character sure but rather onedimensional. The rest of the characters are also sketchily drawn.And as much as I love and admire Hitchcock it did seem as though his heart wasn't in it it is an unusually pedestrian directing job and has little of his trademarkdistinctive directing touches. I'd go as far to say that Jamaica Inn didn't seem like a Hitchcock film but more a Laughton one that's how much he and his character dominated the film and doing it that way it came at the expense of everything else. The editing lacks finesse in regard to editing Jamaica Inn is the least welledited while the dialogue is stilted and the story tediously paced and confused. The makeup especially for Laughton is garish. Overall has its good points but for me Hitchcock's weakest. 410 Bethany Cox";

The hero barely escaped being hung in the middle of the movie. If this movie were in color and had it been produced by Hammer and not Hitchcock it would fit right in with films like Curse of the Werewolf and others.Now perhaps you can help me the original English release was 108 minutes 1 hour 48 minutes and everybody seems to be selling DVDs that are about 8 or 10 minutes shorter.

Steve and Rachel Ward have remarkable chemistry and each of their performances are highly impressive.

It also helps that Miklos Rozsa was the man composing the music as everything shows a cohesiveness that is hard to distinguished in what was shot in 1982 and the old movies.This spoof to the film noir genre is a pure delight. The main character Rigby Reardon is the P.I. from hell but thanks to the creators of this movie he is perfect as the man at the center of the action.Not being a Steve Martin fan one has to recognize that when this actor is inspired he can do excellent work. It would appear that with a director like Carl Reiner he would have gone off the top but instead Mr. Martin gives a good reading of Rigby. Rachel Ward as the typical woman of those films is charming. Reni Santoni Georege Gaynes and the rest of the supporting cast do wonders under Carl Reiner's orders.The film brought back memories of those timeless masterpieces of the past and the stars that shone in them. We get to see Humphrey Bogart Ava Gardner Ingrid Bergman Vincent Price Alan Ladd Veronica Lake Barbara Stanwyck Fred McMurray Edward G.

	schema:reviewBody "I remember reading reviews in The New York Times and elsewhere in 1983 fawning over Woody Allen's brilliant and wholly original idea of inserting himself into old film footage in Zelig. They'd not noted of course that everyone from Ernie Kovacs to John Zacherle had already done that brilliant and wholly original idea on television  and most notably Steve Martin did it in a feature film Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid one year prior to Zelig. While Zelig has its moments it is ultimately tedious running about twice as long as it's onenote gag treatment can sustain. In sharp contrast is the far more clever inspired fully developed insightful and witty DMDWP which as noted. came out one year earlier. As often happens with groundbreakers set somewhere outside the norm DMDWP was not exactly a box office hit  a key reason why no sequels were ever made. That's unfortunate as Martin's character was one of his finest creations and could have sustained more installments in the series. Steve was never better on film than he is here. It's good that the people behind Police Squad did not give up on it after it failed to fit within the confines of standard TV concepts around the same time. Reborn as The Naked Gun series of feature films the Police Squad concept turned into three of the greatest comedy motion pictures of all time. DMDWP deserved a lot better than it got in 1982 as well and I'm glad to see that it has finally found respect and its audience through television exposure much like a previous box office bomb It's A Wonderful Life. The kind of creativity Martin Carl Reiner and the rest of the DMDWP crew put into their project needs to be strongly encouraged  as it represents excellent comic filmmaking as opposed to the witless parade of routine crudities that Hollywood ordinarily churns out.".

Yes it's nonsense and towards the end it becomes a bit hard to follow and the silliness gets out of control. But it's all played straight and for most of the film you could believe you were actually watching a classic film noir.Steve Martin should have done more of these movies. Rigby Reardon was a great character and could have lasted for a few more movies. The humor is frequently hilarious and he certainly retains a lot of the integrity he has lost in recent years since he went the way of Eddie Murphy and sold himself out to family audiences. Either way I say you should give this movie a go if you're a fan of his older work.The DVD is sadly in nonanamorphic 1.851 widescreen with Dolby 2.0 surround. It still looks quite good for a black and white film and the sound has that limited sound space effect to it to make it fit in with the older footage. A Dolby 5.1 remix would have been totally unnecessary. Some boring extras trailer cast bios are included.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ooh deary me. Either I forgot or didn't realize Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid took basically three main actors and spliced them into decades old films. I did eventually roughly one third of the way in but I'll get to that later. This Steve Martin feature escaped me for years until a close friend recommended it to me. I'm not the biggest Martin fan  I can only name three I especially liked Roxanne All of Me and guilty pleasure Housesitter  so I was in no hurry to watch this. And as much as my friend and I agree on 90 of movies some we don't. So it was no 100 guarantee I would like this.Well just to sum it all up that 90 statistic turned to 95 of our movie compatibility. I was laughing throughout this movie way after and when I woke the next morning more scenes floated in my head and I found myself laughing some more.Private detective Rigby Reardon Martin is so stereotypically almost flat broke and down on his luck when doll face Julie Forrest Ward shows up at his office door with an assignment for Rigby to investigate her father's murder. Yeah I say stereotypically but not in a bad way as that's the premisespoof of this movie  either mocking or playing homage to film noir of half a century earlier. Slapstick immediate surfaces and he takes the case on meeting dozens of individuals from a grand multitude of black  white features who advance the casestory so he can get to the bottom of the murder.Seriously as a joy this was to watch  my first time of many guaranteed viewings  I don't want to give away any more. Each scene opened up more laughs for me. And it's one of those rare VERY RARE films that starts off slow mediocre even and gets progressively BETTER.One of the biggest complaints I have with a lot of films is the fact the director andor writer is so incredibly preoccupied on making a movie based solely on one HUGE SECRET or TWIST that they simply forget to make a movie that happens to have a twist. M. Night Shyamalan films fit perfectly into my argument  but more recently A Perfect Getaway. The worst part of those films is if you happen to figure out the secret twisted climax in the first few minutes or someone spoiled it for you you're literally sitting there for two hours where they try and confuse you and throw obvious clues your way. And you never actually get a well made movie  just a bunch of misdirection so you'll be socalled blown away at the end.Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid didn't do this. They played homage to anyone who is in LOVE with those 19301940s classics and grand stars my personal favorite of the group was Grant and Davis and used wonderful splicing new and old techniques. This is obviously a gimmick yet when other lesser directorswriters would rely on this this was only part of the equation. There was really a story here and it really was built as a film noir mystery albeit slapstick 1980s humor.As I stated I didn't catch this device of using old and new until about 13 in with Cary Grant. I didn't read anything about this movie so since it was black  white and Martin actually had dark hair I figured they filmed this when Bogart Grant and Davis were all still alive and dyed their own hair to appear younger. Yeah I'm a dope. Seriously I should've known better.Obviously I won't make that mistake again i.e. in my definite repeat viewings and when I realized what was happening the movie opened up to me making it all the more hilarious and especially when Martin dresses as some of the characters they're mimicking.I would highly recommend this movie especially to those movie buffs of decades past. Though I am only rating it 9 out of 10 stars now that might change even with viewing 2. And I can't wait to see this again. There's severe comic genius here  the finale's battle of words between Reiner and Martin is just one of many examples. SEE IT! Side Note If you have the DVD  make sure you watch the hilarious trailer namely the last 23 seconds had me rolling.".

I didn't read anything about this movie so since it was black  white and Martin actually had dark hair I figured they filmed this when Bogart Grant and Davis were all still alive and dyed their own hair to appear younger. Yeah I'm a dope. Seriously I should've known better.Obviously I won't make that mistake again i.e. in my definite repeat viewings and when I realized what was happening the movie opened up to me making it all the more hilarious and especially when Martin dresses as some of the characters they're mimicking.I would highly recommend this movie especially to those movie buffs of decades past. Though I am only rating it 9 out of 10 stars now that might change even with viewing 2. And I can't wait to see this again. There's severe comic genius here  the finale's battle of words between Reiner and Martin is just one of many examples. SEE IT! Side Note If you have the DVD  make sure you watch the hilarious trailer namely the last 23 seconds had me rolling.";

Obviously the more acquainted you are with those film noirs the more fun this movie will be as you try to recognize what movie those clips came from. The answers are shown in the ending credits. That's the fun part of this movie.The notsofun part is simply trying to figure how what is happening in the first place. The plot is not always easy to discern and it's doubly difficult because of the constant interruptions with the classic film scene inserted in the story. You get so captivated watching those old stars that you lose track of the storyline.That's a big reason I don't think this film ever caught on that much  the story is too convoluted just too hard to follow.Ward was great to watch and Martin was annoying after awhile. If Ward doesn't look like the embodiment of a 1940s film goddess I don't know who does. That and the razor sharp blackandwhite picture with the real actors is nice to see. But Martin who dominates the film overdoes the stupid comments. I would like to have seen this film played a little straighter like a real noir.

The script is clever and sophisticated enough and Carl Reiner directs with precision and acts his part of Field Marshall VonKluck very well. The cinematography is smooth and crisp and I thought the performances were excellent. Steve Martin is great here not only do I think Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid is underrated but this is one of his roles where Martin deserves a lot more credit. Rachel Ward looks lovely as Juliet Forrest and is terrific acting wise. The real joy is watching the archive footage of all those wonderful actors and actresses in those timeless masterpieces. Spotting stars such as Humphrey Bogart Cary Grant Bette Davis Ray Milland Vincent Price and Ingrid Bergman all but to name a few was a delight in itself. Also the finale while silly is great fun.

	schema:headline " Reiner  Martin's LaughIn";
	schema:reviewBody "This film couldn't miss for me as I love Steve Martin's irresistibly funny early films and rank film noir as probably my favourite movie genre.Right from the start we're comfortingly deposited back into the noir era with the classic Universal revolving black and white logo presaging Miklos Rosza's sweeping score and the equally welcome news in the title credits that the great sadly soon to be late Edith Head is costume designer. From there it's a short journey into beautifully shot monochromatic cinematography and Martin's deliberately clichd voiceover setting the scene for a rollercoaster plot as deliberately convoluted as anything this side of The Maltese Falcon or The Big Sleep.The humour is typical earlyMartin which you either love or hate I'm in the former camp and as ever Steve's not above a little vulgarity to drive out the bigger laughs  for instance his hilarious reorganising of passedout leading lady Rachel Ward's out of whack breasts or his answer to Lana Turner's What are we going to do now question as she enters his bedroom  Kinsey covertocover.The vintage filmclips are cleverly inserted into the plot so that we get a dream cast their lines and actions woven even if tenuously into the narrative although ironically the poorer filmquality of some of their scenes work against the glossier quality of the modern camerawork.Martin's by turns quirky and laconic delivery works well in context although Rachel Ward pretty as she is seems too lightweight in her part although she does have some considerable footprints to step into Bette or Lana she isn't.

	onyx:emotionText "This film couldn't miss for me as I love Steve Martin's irresistibly funny early films and rank film noir as probably my favourite movie genre.Right from the start we're comfortingly deposited back into the noir era with the classic Universal revolving black and white logo presaging Miklos Rosza's sweeping score and the equally welcome news in the title credits that the great sadly soon to be late Edith Head is costume designer. From there it's a short journey into beautifully shot monochromatic cinematography and Martin's deliberately clichd voiceover setting the scene for a rollercoaster plot as deliberately convoluted as anything this side of The Maltese Falcon or The Big Sleep.The humour is typical earlyMartin which you either love or hate I'm in the former camp and as ever Steve's not above a little vulgarity to drive out the bigger laughs  for instance his hilarious reorganising of passedout leading lady Rachel Ward's out of whack breasts or his answer to Lana Turner's What are we going to do now question as she enters his bedroom  Kinsey covertocover.The vintage filmclips are cleverly inserted into the plot so that we get a dream cast their lines and actions woven even if tenuously into the narrative although ironically the poorer filmquality of some of their scenes work against the glossier quality of the modern camerawork.Martin's by turns quirky and laconic delivery works well in context although Rachel Ward pretty as she is seems too lightweight in her part although she does have some considerable footprints to step into Bette or Lana she isn't.

	schema:reviewBody "I had heard quite a bit about this comedy film noir I wasn't expecting it to be the funniest film ever I was just looking to seeing how many classic stars would be sliced into the film. Basically private eye detective Rigby Reardon Steve Martin who has a dangerous phobia of cleaning women is hired by Juliet Forrest Rachel Ward who believes the death of her cheese scientist father with a secret recipe was no accident. So begins his investigation finding a list of The Friends and Enemies of Carlotta and he is now trying to find this Carlotta. In his search he encounters assorted lowlifes and a few people on the good side all of which are famous actors in some of their most famous roles of 30's and 40's films. Of course during his investigation he is slowly falling for Juliet and in the end he finds out the villain is Field Marshall VonKluck Carl Reiner who wanted the cheese recipe for himself. To be honest the story isn't the most important thing about this film it is all the classic film clips placed in with the great array of classic stars. Stars placed in the film include Ingrid Bergman Notorious Humphrey Bogart The Big Sleep In a Lonely Place and Dark Passage James Cagney White Heat Joan Crawford Humoresque Bette Davis Deception Kirk Douglas I Walk Alone Ava Gardner The Killers and The Bribe Cary Grant Suspicion Veronica Lake The Glass Key Fred MacMurray Double Indemnity Ray Milland The Lost Weekend Burt Lancaster The Killers Charles Laughton The Bribe Vincent Price The Bribe Barbara Stanwyck Sorry Wrong Number and Lana Turner Johnny Eager and The Postman Always Rings Twice. There is some funny dialogue and tiny moments of slapstick even if you haven't seen the films placed in this spoof is still one for the film buffs. Very good!".

Director Carl Reiner tells the delightfully off the wall story at a constant fast pace delivers a meticulous recreation of the 40's era special kudos are in order for the sets and costumes and shows a genuine affection for vintage 40's noir. It's a real treat to watch Martin interact with such past stars as Humphrey Bogart James Cagney in an especially hilarious scene in which Martin dresses up in drag as Cagney's mother so he can talk to Cagney in jail! Ingrid Bergman Veronica Lake Ava Gardner Charles Laughton Ray Milland Alan Ladd Cary Grant Barbara Stanwyck Joan Crawford and even Vincent Price the editing is seamless and the jokes are bright and witty. Martin plays his role with great aplomb he receives fine support from Ward Reni Santoni as zealous police chief Carlos Rodriguez and Reiner as nefarious Nazi villain Field Marshall Von Kluck. Martin's hardboiled narration crackles with a lot of choice sharp oneliners and the movie boasts a nice sense of the ridiculous I love the way Ward keeps removing bullets from Martin's hide with her teeth!. Michael Chapman's gorgeous moody black and white cinematography perfectly captures that distinctive smoky film noir style. Miklos Rozsa's sweeping melodramatic score likewise does the trick. A very funny and enjoyable oneofakind comedy hoot.".

	schema:headline " Still Uproarious Film Noir Pastiche Thanks to Clever Editing";
	schema:reviewBody "Carl Reiner's 1982 pastiche on 1940's film noir has never received its due as a genuinely clever often hilarious salute to a genre that is ripe for satirical treatment. Filmed in a rich blackandwhite by Michael Chapman the film unique intercuts footage from actual films of the period to make it seem like the thencurrent actors are interacting with the stars of those movies. Consequently Steve Martin looks convincingly like he's talking to the likes of Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep James Cagney in White Heat Ingrid Bergman in Notorious Alan Ladd in This Gun for Hire Burt Lancaster in The Killers Kirk Douglas in I Walk Alone Fred MacMurray in Double Indemnity and several others. The result means there are some contrived plot turns and certainly variations in the graininess of the film stock since 1982 was still well before the enhanced computer graphics we see today but the film is still quite a kick after a quartercentury.The basic plot is straightforward. Rigby Reardon is a classic worldweary gumshoe in the Philip Marlowe mold who is hired by the beautiful and mysterious Juliet Forrest to find out who killed her father a renowned cheese scientist. The story gets complicated because a number of random characters are introduced through the creative editing of the classic film clips. Reardon meets up with some familiar faces and just to watch their nonreaction to Reardon's antics is worthwhile in itself. Credit needs to go to the smart screenplay cowritten by Reiner Martin and George Gipe. Most of the scenes originally intended as straight melodrama in their original context have been turned into uproarious slapstick comedy routines including Martin in drag as Barbara Stanwyck's blonde femme fatale from Double Indemnity wicked doubleentendres and shrewdly offkilter dialogue scenes.The film's climax lifts a long dramatic sequence from 1949's The Bribe in which Ava Gardner Charles Laughton and Vincent Price actually appear to be playing more substantial roles in this movie. In what is probably my favorite of his early screen performances Martin has a good time as Bogie wannabe Reardon gratefully harnessing the manic energy he displayed in his previous collaboration with Reiner The Jerk. Just before she broke out big in The Thorn Birds the stunning Rachel Ward lends a hint of welcome sarcasm to the sexy Bacalllike languor she provides as Juliet tapping into a genuine comedy talent rarely used since. Reni Santoni has the only other role of significance as the grinning Captain Rodriguez who gets entirely too preoccupied with Reardon's pajamas. Legendary costume designer Edith Head did her final work on this film which is fitting since she did many of the costumes on the earlier films. The 1999 DVD unfortunately has no extras.".

Shouldn't it get more enjoyable instead of LESS enjoyable like most movies made today that start with a shock and go downhill? Steve Martin shines throughout this movie and you share his gleeful moments... for example after he's tickled to find that his wife is having an affair with his agent and he converts his makebelieveshock into a dance as he approaches his thenasymbolofaffluence LeBaron in the street... when he tosses his hat to himself after he sets up another way to see the woman he is falling for... Simultaneously though you share his confusion as to how to handle the relationship with the overenergetic giddy 23 year old he's accidentally fallen into bed with along the way. This is a complex movie that presents itself so innocently you can't help but enjoy it. And as a tribute to the brilliance of The Man With Two Brains he even manages to insert a portion of the now legendary Pointy Birds poem. In all this is a worthwhile experience if you're willing to watch it all the way through.

	schema:reviewBody "Okay I was raised in the LA area so I appreciate LA Story more than many might but it's still just an incredibly wonderful romantic comedy regardless of where you grew up.  The script is fabulous and the soundtrack featuring the music of Enya is the perfect counterpoint to this wonderfully wicked lampoon of Southern California culture.The humor is much more intelligent than early Steve Martin features such as The Jerk but it isn't snobbish.  It has wit charm and pure satirical funniness.  Whether it's watching Martin rollerskate through a museum of Old Masters seeing a restaurant full of jaded Californians casually ride out a minor earthquake as their tables gracefully vibrate across the room or the absurdity of a freeway sign giving out cryptic personal messages that change the course of the principal character's lives the movie simply works.Steve Martin is at his best here equal to his wonderful performance in Roxanne.  Victoria Tennant is the perfect choice as the offbeat tubaplaying British journalist Martin's character falls for.  Sarah Jessica Parker is absolutely priceless as SanDeE that's her spelling not a typo the young wouldbe spokesmodelbimbette who likes to point.  Even Rick Moranis as the comedic Cockney grave digger is wonderful despite his having one of the least believable accents since Dick van Dyck as the chimneysweep Bert in Mary Poppins.  Forget the comment about Moranis' accent... you'll enjoy him anyway.Overall this is one of my two favorite movies of all time and considering how many I've enjoyed that's saying volumes.".

When looking at the storyline it does look a bit odd man receiving love advice from a freeway sign? but this helps give it a more surreal and somewhat magical edge. The acting is very good all across the board even from a nonmaneating Sarah Jessica Parker. It has a lot of quotable dialogue she's not young she'll be 27 in 4 years and some passable cameos from Rick Moranis Patrick Stewart and Chevy Chase. Perhaps some scenes get a bit too sentimental and make the film seem a bit uneven. But I think this helps improve the shape of its overall atmosphere and make it heartwarming and not just a bit of gas. LA Story is an underrated classic. It's consistently enjoyable nicely acted and highly memorable. 7.5 out of 10.".

And the movie has more than a few moments of comedic genius.  It's the cumulative effect of little jokes littered throughout the film both verbal and visual that keeps you in stitches.  On top of that it piques your interest.  Here's what I mean  while Martin mercilessly it pokes fun of L.A. for it's flakiness it's love and tolerance of idiosyncrasies it's constant preoccupation with image it's narcissism the humor is never vulgar crass or shallow.  For example one scene takes place in the municipal art museum. We see Harry Telemacher Steve Martin with his friends rapt in admiration for a painting.  The camera angle comes from the canvas itself where we watch Harry deep in thought dissertate on the subjects in the portrait their motives actions and hidden agendas.  He moves forward backward forward again as if in active dialogue with the lacquer.  At last moving backward he concludes his remarks by wrinkling his nose in disgust and saying Look at the way he's holding her  it's almost filthy!' And then the camera moves around to Telemacher's perspective.  The painting's a total abstraction.  There isn't a distinct line in the entire rectangular frame.  In the argot of Postmodernism one might call it a readerly' work of art.  It's the perfect metaphor for L.A. where you may interpret anything any way you like.  There's no standard except one's own personal reality.'  No one can use social norms as a personal club to tell someone else You're wrong' because there is none.  It's all whatEverrrr.' Best of all L.A. Story is a love story the kind of love that adores someone as much for their faults as for their virtues.  Martin's satire is so effective because he loves the city so much.".

I had to watch it several more times to really grasp all of the many complicated levels it contains. This film has more layers than a Vadallia Onion and each one is as sweet and intricate as the next. This film is in many ways the best work Steve Martin has ever done. It reflects the best of his intellectually complicated and sophisticated silliness while also delivering a deeply emotional and spiritual message of self discovery and the eternal hope of love and life. At times poignant and funny concurrently at other times silly and spiritual together this film is an entrancing journey into a vision of a better more hopeful world. The music used in the film particularly Enya's contributions add an profound element of power and beauty to the overall effort. Indeed the music and the way it is employed throughout is a complex layer of the film in and of itself. This film covers the gamut of humanity without being arrogant and mixes Shakespeare Saturday Night Live and Existential Philosophy in a VERY entertaining and at the same time inspiring journey. This was one of the few films I have ever seen that made me laugh cry smile knowingly and get chills all across my spine virtually at the same time. You will need to watch this remarkable effort more than once to appreciate all of its levels and beauty its message and musings its hope and glory while you are laughing and being inspired beyond what seems reasonable for a film all at the same time. This film was never appreciated as it should have been and it is a rare gem. You will never forget this sweet journey into what could be and maybe what should be the real world.".

There are a lot of injokes for Californians but I found the comedy accessible. The film is really stronger on the romance side and has something to say about people who are somewhat phony and put up barriers to the world. As with Roxanne there is a little classic literature dropped in. There are quite a few cheesy moments where the lack of sophistication in the characters and plot does show. But there are also powerful moving scenes such as linking falling in love to the awe and wonder of childhood and the airplane scene which brought tears to my eyes. And that's quite something I almost never cry at the movies!And of course I loved the music by Enya! Check it out.Who should see this film romantic comedy goers a must see action film guys like me it's OK to see it with your SO but see if you can get her to see Enemy at the Gate tooI'll give L.A. Story a surpasseditsoriginalexpectations 9 out of 10.".

As with Roxanne there is a little classic literature dropped in. There are quite a few cheesy moments where the lack of sophistication in the characters and plot does show. But there are also powerful moving scenes such as linking falling in love to the awe and wonder of childhood and the airplane scene which brought tears to my eyes. And that's quite something I almost never cry at the movies!And of course I loved the music by Enya! Check it out.Who should see this film romantic comedy goers a must see action film guys like me it's OK to see it with your SO but see if you can get her to see Enemy at the Gate tooI'll give L.A. Story a surpasseditsoriginalexpectations 9 out of 10.";

	schema:headline " A warm wonderful witty tribute to LA's ways";
	schema:reviewBody "LA Story was one of the rare films Steve Martin wrote a screenplay for. Something he should do more often. His writing style is often fresh and engaging. Its unfortunate that he spends all his time nowadays churning out mediocre stuff in front of the camera when his work on the printed page really crackles with wit. Look no further than the underrated Shopgirl. Martin's best film in ages and all because he was acting from a script he wrote.LA Story is quite possibly the one worthy film of Steve Martin's in the 1990s because right after he started the gradual decline of his career. Unchallenging softheaded fluff that were a waste of Martin's talents. Beginning with the trite and terrible Father of the Bride. And it only got worse from there.But LA Story had Steve Martin at the pinnacle of his powers. It is to Los Angeles what Woody Allen's Manhattan was to New York. LA Story is a film bound to sharply divide people. If you can swallow the film's pill and its a pretty big pill I'll admit you'll find much to enjoy. If you can't LA Story will most likely leave you cold. Look no further than Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel's opposite sides of the spectrum regarding this film.Martin plays wacky weatherman Harris K. Telemacher. Harris takes the daily grindings of LA life in his stride. He's come to expect the random muggings the snooty restaurants and the dull as dishwater art museums that are all part of the wonderful world of Los Angeles. But he couldn't possibly have expected help in his lovelife from an electronic road sign. Before long Harris is caught between two women in his life the free spirited SanDeE Sarah Jessica Parker brilliant! and the prim English rose Sara Victoria Tennant.The success of LA Story rides upon how much you're willing to give in to the film's conceit. After all the very idea of a freeway sign being a possible oracle of the ages is bound to raise more than a few eyebrows. But I put disbelief aside and was swept away by the film's dazzling turns and delightful wit. As I said before Steve Martin's skills as a writer have often been undervalued and his rich and accessible screenplay makes LA Story an astonishing powerful ode to the city of Los Angeles.Steve Martin's feelings about the city can often seem ambivalent. On the one hand he doesn't resist the temptation to satirise LA's shallow superficial side who wouldn't?!. But on the other buried within the film's jokes and opinions there does seem a gentle affection for the city. Perhaps even an admiration. The different people we meet all seem to ennoble a particular facet. To the point that the city of Los Angeles almost takes on a life of its own and becomes a character in of itself.Steve Martin's trademark manic energy is relatively restrained here barring his hilarious weather forecasts always wrong but his enthusiasm for the role shines just as bright as LA itself! He never misses an opportunity to make a glib quip about LA. There are really too many to mention but none of them feel unwelcome. And he's supported himself with a fine cast.In a brief but very memorable role Marilu Henner plays Harris' vain upwardly mobile girlfriend Trudie. A woman that embodies everything wrong with LA. Even when stuck in traffic she's more concerned with outward appearance. Her relationship with Harris is hilarious and when he learns she's been cheating on him for three years his response is priceless this has been going on since the 80s!.The scene stealer of the whole film is Sarah Jessica Parker. What a wonderful performance! Although she plays the role of a typical ditzy LA valley girl she brings so much energy and enthusiasm she walks away with the entire movie. Never has SJP had such fun in a film. Clearly enjoying herself immensely she hops skips and cartwheels her way from one end of the screen to the next. If she stood still for more then ten seconds she would probably explode! The crux of the film is the blossoming love between Harris and Sara but I was secretly hoping he would wind up with SanDeE!But no. That could never be. Victoria Tennant is Steve Martin's true love ironically three years before they divorced. I'm not convinced Tennant is all that much of an actress but her straightfaced style of acting is appropriate when confronted with the outlandish city streets of LA. She's as baffled by its wackiness as Harris is.And things don't get much wackier than the ending where it seems LA itself steps in to play matchmaker between Harris and Sara. Its an ending of such cosmic proportions it will either leave you completely awed or cursing the heavens. I chose the former. The ending could seem ridiculous but not when you take the rest of the film into account beforehand. The emotional climax is earned the way it pieces it together from lots of different elements scattered throughout the film. But that's something you couldn't possibly know until you've seen the film a few dozen times.LA Story is a true classic. Mick Jackson's direction is so whimsical and lush every frame bursts out with a joy and exuberance not often found in Hollywood entertainment. I felt flattened by the film's finale helped no end by the exhilarating Exile sung hauntingly by Enya. It all adds up to a rather delectable confection. They say Los Angeles is the City of Angels. I think of it more as a City of Dreamers. And LA Story shows how the dreams of the few can sometimes come true.".

Also it's a must see for fans of Sarah Jessica Parker as this is one of her best performances from her starlet days.

But that doesn't matter because everything else in the movie is right on the money.A feelgood film sharply written and delivered. Also it's a must see for fans of Sarah Jessica Parker as this is one of her best performances from her starlet days. There are several laughoutloud moments including the hilarious earthquake scene and on the whole the film is a real winner. A great movie that I really enjoyed.";

Martin is in a lackluster relationship with a woman Henner when he meets a pretty British journalist in town to do a story on Los Angeles. Martin is a wacky weatherman falls for the British lady and while stalled on the freeway encounters a road conditions message board that begins to communicate with him helps him start on the road to getting his life straightened out then starts his car so he can get on his way.

His comedy is borderline wacky and he is the expert at physical humor but unlike Jim Carrey he knows when to contain himself how to make a real character and how to make those zany qualities work just right.His writing is dazzling and offbeat and wacky and outrageous. Part of my computer's harddrive is dedicated to old Steve Martin albums from Saturday Night Live and his standup routines. I give him credit for coming up with the word Google in his Googlephonics skit. But anyway.L.A. Story 1991 is Martin's homage to Los Angeles. It's a slapstick comedy and a touching romance story. Sometimes we get jokes nearing ridiculous and sometimes we get moments of pure reality. Normally this uneven blending of two very different genres would never work but give the guy credit for making it work splendidly well.In L.A. Story Martin plays Wacky Weatherman Harris K. Telemacher the type of loony guy you sometimes wish would take the place of those boring meterologists on your local news channel that point at their boards and seem as if they're about to fall asleep. Harris has got it all living the highlife in rich L.A. with a beautiful gal Marilu Henner and a great job. But then one day he's fired his girlfriend dumps him for his agent Kevin Pollack and he's got nowhere to go in life.That's when he meets Sara Victoria Tennant Martin's reallife wife a British journalist researching L.A. for a news article. Harris takes her on a tour of L.A. Some of these buildings are over twenty years old he says.Harris also sparks a relationship with a young ditz named SanDeE Sarah Jessica Parker who doesn't care if she's being used as long as she's having fun. She twirls around and does cartwheels and makes Harris feel young again.And thrown together with all this is an electronic highway sign. The sign gives Harris a riddle to unscramble throughout the film and when the answer is finally revealed it's pure Steve Martin humor.Steve Martin has a way of parodying anything. I laughed so hard at L.A. Story I cried but then the movie takes a break from being silly and throws in lots of romance and such. But unlike other movies it seems to fit perfectly. It's beautiful and offbeat. It sort of reminds me of last year's PunchDrunk Love only L.A. Story seems to have a bit more purpose and the characters are a lot more likable. It's also a lot funnier.This is probably one of the most quotable films of all time. It's not as good as Martin's Planes Trains and Automobiles 1987 but I'll admit that Martin's writing lends better oneliners than the former which is strangely funnier though. I just can't get enough of Steve Martin's wonderful wit. Every time you think that L.A. Story is settling down to go into the typical romantic comedy cliches such as the slowmotion shower scene with the beautiful woman splashing her wet hair over the camera something happens. In this case we see Harris in HIS shower bathing himself and glancing down at the tap. One knob says Slow Motion he turns it and suddenly he's splashing over his hair and the camera in slow motion.The movie features cameos ranging from Rick Moranis who has starred in four films with Martin Patrick Stewart Woody Harrelson and even Chevy Chase. The best is undoubtedly Moranis' British gravedigger Finally Harris says a funny gravedigger! I wouldn't want to ruin some of the scenes or quotes but the beginning sequence with Harris in his car swerving through neighbors' backyards and sidewalks and down stairs to avoid rush hour traffic had me laughing hysterically and so did a scene where he grabs a handgun from his glove compartment and gets in a road duel with a delivery truck.They key to all this humor I think is how delightfully over the top and realistic it is. Martin finds a funny social topic  such as restaurant booking procedures  and stretches it out into the absurd. And you know what? It works. Because it's Steve Martin. And Steve Martin has hit gold with L.A. Story. Fans and nonfans alike will love this movie. And I'm going to end with a quote from the filmSitting there at that moment I thought of something else Shakespeare said. He said 'Hey...life is pretty stupid with lots of hubbub to keep you busy but really not amounting to much.' Of course I'm paraphrasing 'Life is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing.'I love that wild wit.4.55 stars.John Ulmer".

I read someplace where Mary Steenburgen had been working as a waitress in an Arizona dinner and Nicholson stopped in and thought she would be perfect for the part. I think there is some very touching scenes between Nicholson and Steenburgen that are well written and acted. Except for Christopher Lloyd the rest of the cast is wasted.

	schema:reviewBody "Goin' South is a watchable comedy directed by and starring Jack Nicholson. Filmed cheaply with a local crew down in Mexico the film wasn't received well upon release. Star Wars had rendered westerns obsolete and screwball comedies were long out of date.Still Goin' South holds up pretty well. Nichsolson's performance is amazing and cinematographer Nstor Almendros equals his work on Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven.The film works more as a bizarre insight into Jack Nicholson than a comedy. He turns what should be light slapstick into a pretty nasty and mean spirited R rated comedydrama. Watching his filmography from end to end I'm surprised how consistently wicked and misogynistic his characters are. Here he players an outlaw who's hired by a sexually repressed woman to work in her gold mines. After tying her to a bed and giving her the hump of her life she renounces her repressed ways and gradually begins to appreciate his animalistic masculinity.The Jack Nicholson persona seems to constantly be seeking to dominate women. If he can't have his way he breaks down. Goin South is like a happy version of his Carnal Knowledge only here he finally gets a girl who submits to his primal charm.In terms of comedy the film is similar in tone to the Coen Brothers' O Brother Where Art Thou? It's not as visually stylish but the emphasis on wacky accents is the same. The cast includes Danny Devito John Belushi and Christopher Lloyd and many other comic faces pop up.But it's Jack Nicholson's face that keeps us watching. He's manic cartoonish sadistic and riveting. Take a look at the IMDb photo of this film the DVD cover. The guy looks like a bearded Saddam Hussein laughing at his hang man's noose like a psychopath. Nicholson's face is a work of art. His eyebrows are constantly twitching his eyes constantly mischievous his teeth lighting up his face. Whether you enjoy the film will depend on whether you love his scenery chewing. He puts so much energy and skill into his performance here that he transcends everything else about this film.610 Worth one viewing. I recommend fast forwarding all the exposition and simply watching Jack act. The guy's a pleasure to watch.".

It's a western about an outlaw called Henry Moon who is saved from execution by a sexually repressed woman who owns a gold mine. To his chagrin she immediately sets him to work there needless to say they don't get along at first but then they do later on.This is essentially an odd couple film. It plays things consistently for laughs but like the majority of comedy westerns it really isn't too funny. Nicholson may be a great actor but he isn't a very good director. The pacing lags badly in the second half but the story isn't terribly engaging overall. It also stars a host of actors who would go on to become stars in the 80's such as Danny Devito John Belushi and Christopher Lloyd. But despite the potential that this cast suggests most have very underdeveloped roles and it feels suspiciously like Nicholson invited them along just so that he could have a laugh on set. The western itself was in decline by the late 70's in any case and Going' South didn't bring anything new to the table to help change that. It's a film that seems to have a minor cult reputation but I didn't think it was too good and it's certainly one of Nicholson's lesser film outings.".

I believe that is one mark of a wellmade and wellwritten movie.From the opening scenes with Moon's horse keeling over as he dances celebrating his get away to the tender moments between Moon and Julia after they divide up the gold I find this movie gives and keeps on giving.Henry Moon's lines are hilarious and delivered only as Jack can do. Mary Steenburgen delivers a performance as good as any first time to the screen and the other characters are played wonderfully by current and soontobe stars of TV and cinema.I love turning people on to this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Many folks think Nicholson can do no wrong. But in my book this mess has to be the nadir of his often outstanding career. When he's got a strong guiding hand as in 5 Easy Pieces 1970 or Chinatown 1974 he can deliver aces. Here however he's directing himself and the result is a leering eyerolling slice of buffoonery perhaps an egotrip of some misguided sort. The movie itself collapses into near incoherence lacking both narrative sense and timing. Events follow in no particular order while scenes too often appear to indulge the actor instead of playing to others or advancing the story. Actually the movie reminds me perversely of a kids Saturday matine where the baddie schemes to grab the good girl's land and Gabby Hayes or Smiley Burnette supplies comic relief. Except here there's only the buffoon the land grabber and the good girl. I do however feel sorry for Mary Steenburgen whose affecting performance gets lost amid the eyerolling antics. Now I don't know if Nicholson went on a coke binge while shooting in Mexico as did his buddy Dennis Hopper when he made the disastrous The Last Movie 1971 in Peru. But it would explain a lot. Anyway the 100 minutes remains an obscure mess even 40years later and is not so much rollicking as just plain idiotic.".

	schema:reviewBody "I knew that going in and watching Goin' South that it wouldn't be anything great or special and it certainly is not one of Nicholson's better works even though he directed. Clearly the western genre is not Jack's trademark type of film and his character is out of place at least appearance wise. It just looked so uncommon seeing Nicholson looking rugged with a hairy beard and listening to him talk in a slang country western drawl sounded so out of place. Anyway this little western try which was directed by Nicholson himself has himself as outlaw Henry Moon set in the 1860's. Moon is about to be hanged only to be saved by a lovely young gal who promises to marry him and take charge. Her name is Julia TateMary Steenburgenwho's headstrong and smart yet her character is very sheltered and plain as a Southern virgin.

Really this film is nothing great it's just so out of place for a genre of Jack's and the film is paced as a slapstick style comedy making it a very amusing western with no drama found that's so common in western films. Still it has it's good points to watch mainly the growing and transformation of the Steenburgen character into a molding lady of experience and her screen chemistry with Jack was good.

Clearly the western genre is not Jack's trademark type of film and his character is out of place at least appearance wise. It just looked so uncommon seeing Nicholson looking rugged with a hairy beard and listening to him talk in a slang country western drawl sounded so out of place. Anyway this little western try which was directed by Nicholson himself has himself as outlaw Henry Moon set in the 1860's. Moon is about to be hanged only to be saved by a lovely young gal who promises to marry him and take charge. Her name is Julia TateMary Steenburgenwho's headstrong and smart yet her character is very sheltered and plain as a Southern virgin.

First there is Jack Nicholson Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd all of whom were in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest together three years earlier in 1975. Needless to say Nicholson must have had some influence in casting DeVito and Lloyd as he directed this picture. DeVito and Lloyd were still relatively unknown until they were cast the following year in TAXI. Next we have Veronica Cartwright who would be cast in ALIEN the very next year in 1979. Then we have the lovely Luana Anders who looked just as fabulous as she did 17 years earlier in her signature role as Don'a Medina in The Pit and the Pendulum in 1961. There is John Belushi in his first film role which ironically was in the same year that he would appear in Animal House. Finally Mary Steenburgen appears here in her first film as well. She would later go on to make some fabulously successful appearances in films like Parenthood and Back to the Future Part 3. As for the movie it was an underrated and relatively unknown independent film made by Nicholson on a lark. It remains one of those magnificent sleepers that was just great fun to watch. It's a happy movie with lots of laughs and lessons in loyalty and kindness. It remains one of my favorite comedies westerns and casts nearly 40 years later.".

Abused and treated as an animal he comes to adapt to his life in order to survive. Enduring torture and oppression he must earn their respect in order to be accepted as part of their tribe.The white man as part of a Sioux tribe story was given a major shot in the arm with Kevin Costner's Oscar bagger Dances With Wolves in 1990. This picture came out some twenty years before Costner's stylish picture but the two films couldn't be further apart in terms of story telling. Here in Elliot Silverstein's picture the scenery and scope is certainly lush but the niceties stop there for this is a harsh at times painful story with realism dripping from each frame. Silverstein wanted to get as close as he could to the facts of the Sioux way of life even bringing in a Sioux historian to oversee the production.The Sioux are painted on both sides of the canvas on one side we are shown them to be violent even sadistic but Silverstein also portrays them as an intelligent race driven on by intense loyalty to their ways and culture. Richard Harris plays our main protagonist and has a clear license to act with immense verve and vigour it's a memorable turn that lingers long after the credits roll. Hurting the film is a twee romance between Morgan and the Chiefs daughter Judith Anderson and Jean Gascon's fluctuating accents start to grate entering the film's last quarter. But really the plus points far outweigh the little irritants in the piece. The editing from Philip W. Anderson  Michael Kahn is like a whirling paean to hallucinations and some scenes are from the top draw most notably the Vow To The Sun ritual that literally is painful to watch. A Man Called Horse may well be of its time but it's certainly a very interesting and highly intelligent film. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1825 the Sioux leaded by Yellow Hand Manu Tupou capture the English nobleman John Morgan Richard Harris while hunting in the United States of America. John is brutally treated like an animal by the Indian and is given to help Buffalo Cow Head Judith Anderson the mother of Yellow Hand as if he were a horse. Without understanding the language and behavior of the Sioux he is helped by Batise Jean Gascon a white man made prisoner and mutilated by the Indians five years ago. Batise translates and explains the Sioux's culture for John plotting to escape some day back to the civilization with him. After an undefined long time later John loses his snobbish behavior and is reasonably integrated to the Sioux. One day he kills two enemies Shoshones who were spying and stalking the Sioux and gains the respect of the Sioux and love of the sister of Yellow Hand Running Deer Corinna Tsopei. John marries Running Deer and integrates to their culture and after a tragic attack of the Shoshones to the Sioux tribe he becomes their leader. A Man Called Horse is a spectacular and powerful classic western of the 70's. The first time I saw this movie I was a teenager and left the theater completely astonished with such a different story in that time and the violence of the scenes. Two days ago I bought the VHS and yesterday I saw it again and it is still a very impressive film with magnificent performances of the cast highlighting Richard Harris and Judith Anderson. The production is very careful being mostly spoken in Sioux and depicting in a realistic way the life the behavior the common laws and the moral practices of the Sioux. I believe that A Man Called Horse with the Sioux Soldier Blue with the Cheyenne and Little Big Man all of them from 1970 were among the first movies to show the lives of prisoners of the North American Indians in their tribes. The amazing scene of John Morgan suspended by his chest in an Indian ceremony is unforgettable and very impressive. My vote is ten.Title Brazil Um Homem Chamado Cavalo Spectacular Classic Western".

	onyx:emotionText "In 1825 the Sioux leaded by Yellow Hand Manu Tupou capture the English nobleman John Morgan Richard Harris while hunting in the United States of America. John is brutally treated like an animal by the Indian and is given to help Buffalo Cow Head Judith Anderson the mother of Yellow Hand as if he were a horse. Without understanding the language and behavior of the Sioux he is helped by Batise Jean Gascon a white man made prisoner and mutilated by the Indians five years ago. Batise translates and explains the Sioux's culture for John plotting to escape some day back to the civilization with him. After an undefined long time later John loses his snobbish behavior and is reasonably integrated to the Sioux. One day he kills two enemies Shoshones who were spying and stalking the Sioux and gains the respect of the Sioux and love of the sister of Yellow Hand Running Deer Corinna Tsopei. John marries Running Deer and integrates to their culture and after a tragic attack of the Shoshones to the Sioux tribe he becomes their leader. A Man Called Horse is a spectacular and powerful classic western of the 70's. The first time I saw this movie I was a teenager and left the theater completely astonished with such a different story in that time and the violence of the scenes.

	schema:reviewBody "I have not seen this movie since it first came out in the 70s and just caught it again on TV yesterday with the first sequel right after it. After all these years it still holds up well. Many have compared Dances with Wolves to this movie for good reason even Richard Harris himself accused Kevin Costner of blatantly using scenes from it for his lengthy blockbuster epic. I dare say that the depiction of the Sioux way of life was even more realistic in A Man Called Horse than it is in the more romanticized Dances With Wolves. While some of the earlier westerns using so called hollywood indians have no doubt great entertainment value I do welcome movies that don't portray the native Americans as barbaric savages. Using native American actors speaking their native tongue instead of painted white actors wearing oh so obvious wigs and speaking in a madeup language was not common back then and A Man Called Horse was one of the earliest movies to do so way ahead of it's time. The cinematography of the wide open prairie was breathtaking and the scenes portraying the suspension in the sun vow ritual were extremely realistic making me wonder if Richard Harris actually did have his skin pierced. Interesting that so many young people are now trying suspension as a means of getting an adrenaline rush although in a more modern setting using surgical steel hooks the principal is still the same.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you've ever seen the movie the image will stay with you forever. The ritual of piercing the flesh with eagle talons and skewering it with a blade to hoist one's body into the air is pretty gruesome to contemplate much less actually having it done. I'm not all that squeamish but I have to admit I had some trouble with the idea of the 'vow to the sun' ceremony. Oddly this film is the only instance I've ever come across it so I'd have to do some research to learn more about it.Where the film broke new ground back in 1970 was it's revisionist treatment of Indian life and culture. Similar to Little Big Man which came out the same year the picture offered a unique perspective on individuals rather than broad generalizations of Indian tribal life. Actually Little Big Man went even further than this picture with it's treatment of a gay Indian named Little Horse and the concept of a contrary Younger Bear who did everything backwards. The character Batise Jean Gascon performs that function here though he's only part Indian by birth and uses the ruse that he's a bit crazy to keep his Sioux hosts from putting him to work. I think the most surprising concept though was the idea that Thorn Rose Lina Marin left her husband Yellow Hand Manu Tupou for rival Black Eagle Eddie Little Sky within the same tribe. You just don't consider Indian cultures to be subject to the same kind of human frailties that the white man has. At least I never gave it a second thought.There was however a situation that didn't ring very authentic to me. In the scene where Running Deer Corinna Tsopei gets ready to make love to Richard Harris's character following the sun ceremony a closeup of her hands show them to be perfectly manicured with a sheen of nail polish. So much for that bit of historical accuracy.One thing about American Indians that's always fascinated me is the names they have that usually describe some aspect of their character and this one had it's share with the ones already mentioned along with Buffalo Cow Head Dame Judith Anderson and Striking Bear Terry Leonard. However if you stick around for the end credits you'll catch the names of a host of Rosebud Sioux tribesmen who appeared uncredited in the film among them Richard Fool Bull Bruce Pretty Bird Ross Kills Enemy and my personal favorite  James Never Miss A Shot.".

	schema:headline " A Man Called Horse  Richard Harris At His Best..";
	schema:reviewBody "The late great Richard Harris. Not counting his foray into recorded pop music with MacAurther Park. He was one the great English actors of his time. From Camelot where he played King Aurthur to this truly bold and gritty role as a privileged young Englishmanlooking for more in his life than those rights of inheritance. I got this movie and it's sequel from the library and watched both back to back.From the outsetthis movie while set well over 100 years before 1970reflected the young American point of view at that time of fighting the conventions and traditional beliefs of one's elders. Some may find that kind of idea dated but in my view there really is nothing more confining than living life as others expect you to and conform to the norm.John Harris is unfortunately saddled with 3 typical uneducatedharddrinking guideswho think of him as an English dandy and give him no respect. Going so far as to ruin his property while he's out hunting. Enter the SiouxYellow Hand tribe male warriors whofor seemingly no reason other than these are white menattack and kill all but John.They fish an unclothed bathing John from the lake and as the title implies dub him a horse and drag him literallyback to camp. He's taunted and harassed and made to be the workhorse of a cranky Sioux elder woman. Children even ride him during a wild party.Another man who was captured 5 years sooner and suffered even worse is the wonderful character Batiste. He speaks French English and Siuox and behaves like he's lost his mind so the tribesmen would stop bothering him. Thushe becomes the coconspirator in helping Horse gain his freedom. John falls for the lovely Sioux girl he dubs Little Freedom and goes through a ritual guaranteed to make fainthearted viewers cringe. The Vow To The Sunwhere sharp claws and hooks are attached to his chest and he's then hoisted by ropes through the open roof and spun around. This is a test in the ability to endure pain and sufferingsort of a metaphor for all the NativeAmeicans have suffered at the hands of people from other countries. John wins his bride but they still have to fight a warring rival tribe and the battle comes later. John ends up losing his closest friends and his wife and vows to be the son of the elder woman until she finally passes on. It's true a great deal of this is not factualdespite being about a real person. Hollywood has a notorious history of taking the background of other races and distorting who and what they're about. It's a little surprising here given they were trying to make a film that gives a better idea of what actual Indian tribes were like. Other than those unfortunate but hardly surprising misstepsthis film is a classic and a great riveting story. I don't really see how one comes up empty after watching this film. Empty would be those ridiculous movies where Indians speak in that fake dialect dreamed up by Hollywood. You smoke 'em peacepipe? Puhlease!I give ten stars for this film because it is a great story to watch. Probably even a better one to readsince it is based on the book of the same name. Maybe I'll give that a read too. END".

	onyx:emotionText "The late great Richard Harris. Not counting his foray into recorded pop music with MacAurther Park. He was one the great English actors of his time. From Camelot where he played King Aurthur to this truly bold and gritty role as a privileged young Englishmanlooking for more in his life than those rights of inheritance. I got this movie and it's sequel from the library and watched both back to back.From the outsetthis movie while set well over 100 years before 1970reflected the young American point of view at that time of fighting the conventions and traditional beliefs of one's elders. Some may find that kind of idea dated but in my view there really is nothing more confining than living life as others expect you to and conform to the norm.John Harris is unfortunately saddled with 3 typical uneducatedharddrinking guideswho think of him as an English dandy and give him no respect. Going so far as to ruin his property while he's out hunting. Enter the SiouxYellow Hand tribe male warriors whofor seemingly no reason other than these are white menattack and kill all but John.They fish an unclothed bathing John from the lake and as the title implies dub him a horse and drag him literallyback to camp. He's taunted and harassed and made to be the workhorse of a cranky Sioux elder woman. Children even ride him during a wild party.Another man who was captured 5 years sooner and suffered even worse is the wonderful character Batiste. He speaks French English and Siuox and behaves like he's lost his mind so the tribesmen would stop bothering him. Thushe becomes the coconspirator in helping Horse gain his freedom. John falls for the lovely Sioux girl he dubs Little Freedom and goes through a ritual guaranteed to make fainthearted viewers cringe. The Vow To The Sunwhere sharp claws and hooks are attached to his chest and he's then hoisted by ropes through the open roof and spun around. This is a test in the ability to endure pain and sufferingsort of a metaphor for all the NativeAmeicans have suffered at the hands of people from other countries. John wins his bride but they still have to fight a warring rival tribe and the battle comes later. John ends up losing his closest friends and his wife and vows to be the son of the elder woman until she finally passes on. It's true a great deal of this is not factualdespite being about a real person. Hollywood has a notorious history of taking the background of other races and distorting who and what they're about. It's a little surprising here given they were trying to make a film that gives a better idea of what actual Indian tribes were like. Other than those unfortunate but hardly surprising misstepsthis film is a classic and a great riveting story. I don't really see how one comes up empty after watching this film. Empty would be those ridiculous movies where Indians speak in that fake dialect dreamed up by Hollywood. You smoke 'em peacepipe? Puhlease!I give ten stars for this film because it is a great story to watch. Probably even a better one to readsince it is based on the book of the same name. Maybe I'll give that a read too. END";

At first he is mistreated and looked down upon by them. As he learns about them he comes to realize that their culture is preferable to him to the one he was born into. As he comes to respect them they eventually begin to return the respect. He eventually goes through the Indian manhood ritual and becomes one of the tribe. I believe this film was the basis for Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves. A Man Called Horse is a true classic film and is just outstanding in nearly every way.".

	schema:reviewBody "As noted Lakota historian Vine Deloria Jr. said about this movie As we learned from movies like A Man Called Horse the more accurate and authentic a film is said to be the more extravagant it is likely to be ... in its misrepresentation of Indians. I read comments where viewers believed that this movie provided a fair and sympathetic portrayal of Indian people. Don't you believe it. Neither Lakota people nor any other Native group allowed their elders to die of starvation and exposure as portrayed in this movie. There can be no other example in any movie portraying Indians that is more offensive than this. On the contrary it is American society that throws their elders into old folks homes where they are often neglected and abused not us. The Sundance a sacred religious ceremony of commitment sacrifice and thanksgiving is portrayed as some kind of macho baloney that every male had to undergo in order to prove his manhood in fact the film implies that a male without scars could not have a woman. This is patently false and cheapens the commitment of the participants. Not everyone participates nor are they expected to. Further the jacket on the original VHS tape states that in order to recreate authentic costuming the production designer met with real American Indians only to discover their notion of clothing was based on the costumes designed by Hollywood studios. The arrogance of this statement would almost be beyond belief if we were not already long used to this kind of American egotism already. Next time you watch it look at the unimaginative costuming. Everyone of you has probably seen examples of the beautiful quill work that preceded the use of trade beads. Then of course the Lakota can only beat the Pawnee because the British lord teaches them how to really fight. Give me a break. It's the same theme in Dances with Wolves and other films. Love this movie defend this movie but don't for an instant believe that it is an authentic portrayal of anything other than some Hollywood director's uninspired attempt to show us how much he really doesn't know about Indians.".

It had no cowboys. And it had very little dialog in English.The film begins with a rich Englishman John Morgan Richard Harris on a hunting expedition in the American West in the 1830s. He and his party are attacked by Sioux warriors and Morgan is taken prisoner by the natives. At first he's treated like a slave and his life truly sucks. It didn't help that the only one who spoke any English in the tribe was another slave who was French...and the guy was a little nuts! Through the course of the film however Morgan learns to respect and even enjoy life with the Sioux and becomes an important member of the tribe. There is naturally much more to it than that but it's best you just see it for yourself.This movie is almost like an ethnographic portrait of the Sioux and the times instead of a typical western film. The usual sorts of clichs and expectations are mostly missing. Some will hate thissome will no doubt be relieved. All I know is that I enjoyed it and liked the more intimate and nativecentered approach of the film. Well made all around...though the sun ceremony is NOT for the squeamish.".

Harris is excellent in the lead role playing both nobleman and hardened warrior well. The most interesting point of the movie is the general lack of dialogue. The Native Americans speak in their own tongue which Harris' character does not understand at all to begin with and no attempt is made by the director to enlighten the viewer as to what is being said. A brave and incredibly forward thinking decision. As a result you as the viewer are propelled into Harris' world where strange language and bizarre rituals have to be observed carefully before they can be understood. Dated for sure but this is still an interesting movie and the fact that the two hour running time passes in the blink of an eye seems to indicate it is also engrossing.Well worth the effort.".

Secondly there was never a requirement for anyone to go through the Lakota sun dance a fourday event with the piercing on the last day.

The film makes some mistakes in portraying Dakota culture  and some oversimplifications  but I can let those pass in the context  its a movie not a doctoral thesis.So to the big problem  the casting. The lack of native Americans in the main native American roles is a big issue here. This would be a 10 for me if it had been addressed. We have Fijians Australians and even 'Americans' in the roles  but would the film have been made at this time otherwise? I'm also not sure  but the at the time small pool of native American film actors may have been denuded by the fact Little Big Man and Soldier Blue were made at about the same time. Perhaps I'm being overgenerous there though. As for Iron Eyes Cody  well everyone? thought he was the real deal. LOL.My namesake Andrew has made some cogent criticisms and I'll answer a few of them. First the Harris character is not sympathetic  in my view that's a strength of the film. Also don't fall into the trap that all English or Welsh  he is Morgan! noblemen were effete. Our colonial history is littered with folk from privileged backgrounds proving they were tougher than you might think. However I suspect his lordship's feet might have been an issue...On the Sun Vow  the film makes a good effort and Batiste makes it clear that this is a lengthy ceremony  not a few minutes. Its also clear the Dakota are worshipping the spirit of the sun  not the sun. Its animism not sunworship. Others are more expert than I to comment on the true nature of Dakota religion. As for Harris's speech at the ceremony  listen to what he is saying again.On to the portrayal of warfare. Yes Indian warfare was traditionally small raiding. But this is circa 1826 and western influences had crept in by this point. The Fox and Illinois Wars were frankly genocidal and were far from the only case of Native Americans being encouraged to eliminate 'troublesome Indians' by outside influences. The Iroquois earlier hadn't needed too much training... Its not too much of a stretch to see the Shoshone in such a role. As for the lines of warriors putting the Shoshone to flight  ahem. A bit of a far stretch... Don't assume disorganised fighters always beat organised ones  the history of the world proves otherwise.Finally a word for Jean Gascon  the Quebecois playing the metis Batiste. A lovely little performance  whatever you think of his hairstyle. LOL".

Sneakers captured that mood perfectly and kept things tense with the soundtrack locations and set work.It's got the best balance of technical accuracy verses ease of viewing that I've ever seen on film.  Not too many cartoonlike computer interfaces but no staring for minutes at a time at command line interfaces.  Sneakers also gets points for being in the Bay Area and traveling among places that I visit every day Hills Brother Coffee Building for the 'box drop' and the Dumbarton Bridge  for starters.  Actors have fun with their roles although it's obvious that Sidney Poitier Robert Redford Ben Kingsley and James Earl Jones are not delivering their AGame.  It doesn't matter it doesn't make it any less fun to watch.  I like Phil Alden Robinson's camera movements don't forget to look for the long low slide across the Scrabble pieces right in a pivotal moment of the plot.The movie still retains some relevance today.  Ben Kingsley offers that gem  world war. And it's not about who's got the most bullets. It's about who controls the information. What we see and hear how we work what we think... it's all about the information! gains some credibility especially in the face of the post911 news reporting on CNN MSNBC and Fox News. Trashdiving is still a viable option to gain information on your opponent and social engineering will always work to help you gain some information.Sneakers is still one of the best mainstream treatments on the subject of hacking.  Watch learn enjoy.".

I am an intelligent moviegoer and I loved Sneakers.  And I know others who are much more intelligent than me and some who I would even guess are certifiable geniuses who also loved this movie.This movie is captivating.  As other people have written Sneakers can be watched over and over again.  Its a suspense thriller that doesn't try to blind you with so many special effects that you lose sight of the fact that less than five minutes was used to create and edit the script ie. Mission Impossible 2.This is a fun movie for anybody who is a team player.  Its very entertaining to see how each member of Redford's team brings an essential element to the task at hand.  There are a couple of scenes where some things are far fetched but nothing outside the rhelm of possibility.  There is nothing that makes you groan in disgust as if say you were watching any scene in a John Woo film.  For a movie like this to work it has to be believable and this is believable.Sneakers is original in its ideas and the characters are very likable. Even the villian possesses qualities that make you like him.  Each character is developed enough so that by the end of the movie you want to be a part of the team.  Its just that much fun to watch.  1010".

	schema:reviewBody "I was drawn to Sneakers because I heard the story was of my favorite genre a spy thriller. However I found this movie to be more along the lines of a caper film.Robert Redford is the leader of a team of experts who break into security systems so that institutions such as banks can see how good their system is. The team is made up of a diverse group an exCia agent Portier and three computer whizzes Ackroyd Phoenix and the blind Stratharn. The group has great chemistry and often this leads to some fun humor.Redford and his team are hired by the government so they believe to retrieve a black box that can decode encrypted computer firewalls. After retrieving the black box the team finds themselves in dire trouble. I was hoping the film would be more intense yet Sneakers incorporates a lot of humor. It is a fun film and is enjoyable to watch but if you are looking for a true spy film then you may want to pass.This film more closely resembles recent movies like Ocean's 11 or The Italian Job popcorn films that have some laughs some danger and some suspense.Redford is really great in this movie as is Straitarn Mary McDonnell is also very good. Phoenix holds his own. Although far from their best roles Poitier James Earl Jones Ackroyd and Ben Kingsley are decent.Overall an enjoyable film which incorporates computer hacking before it was mainstream. Rating 7 of 10 stars.".

It still gets a place on the mantel.The movie starts with a young Marty and Cosmo back in 1969 doing some early computer hacking. They're busily transferring money from those who have it to those who need it. Example taking from Richard Nixon's personal checking account and giving it to the Association of Legalized Marijuana. Truly Robin Hoods. But then Marty gets hungry so he heads out for pizza. When he gets to the van and tries to start it flashing lights appear outside head upstairs and haul Cosmo away. Marty runs and then it fades to present day which when the movie was made was 1992.Martin Brice Redford now goes by the alias of Martin Bishop. He has an interesting job. As a bank teller says So you get hired to break into other people's places to make sure nobody can break into their places? In the team is a blind sound expert who goes by the name of Whistler Straithairn an electronics expert who goes by Mother Akroyd a teenager named Carl Phoenix and an exCIA agent Donald Crease Poitier.One day they get some clients who walk in with a long list of information on all the people in Bishop's team. The only person they don't have info on is Martin Bishop. They then identify themselves as NSA tell Bishop that they know his real identity and ask to meet with them again for a special assignment. That assignment is to steal a little black box from some mathematician. Bishop's crew doesn't know what the box does so they accept the offer. As part of the deal it pays 175000 and they'll clear Bishop's record.Once they have the box they fiddle around with it a little and discover that it is actually a sophisticated code breaker that can hack American encryption systems. But when they are getting ready to give it to the NSA guys they find out that Dr. Janek the mathematician has been murdered. At this point it's kind of hard to not wonder how important the box is but unfortunately the box is already in the NSA's hands before they find out about Janek and so they drive away with no money and no little black box.It's around this point where the plot of the movie really takes off and it gets very interesting. I'm not going to say much else. You'll just have to watch it for yourself and see.Bottom Line 4 out of 4 own this movie".

Without giving too much away because I'm an advocate of the second type of viewing Robert Redford is the head of a secret group of hackers including Sidney Poitier Dan Aykroyd David Strathairn and River Phoenix. Everyone has skeletons in their closet Robert Redford in particular so when they're threatened to take on a particular case they've got no choice but to accept.The entire team has great comic timing and chemistry together. Robert and Sidney make a few jokes about getting older but they really don't look much older than their heydays. I'd never seen David Strathairn in a movie before and he was so convincing in his role as a blind man I thought Hollywood was starting the career of an actually blind actor. Sneakers is a fantastic movie with a perfect blend of humor action suspense and romance. It's full of quotable lines and memorable scenes. If you don't start laughing the next time you hear someone say password you probably need to watch the movie again. Every time I watch it I get inspired to chop off my locks because of Mary McDonnell's adorable haircut. It's one of the cutest do's ever!".

This movie's a whole lot of fun with a great group of characters and a killer cast all around. It's a terrific ensemble each with their own distinct personality and Strathairn having the most fun.

This film is entitled  Sneakers  and is about a group of Cyberspecialists who advertise themselves as computer security experts. Their job is to test the encryption systems of various electronic based companies. In their youth two college students Jo Marr and Gary Hershberger seeking to right the world's financial problems break into a University system as a prank. Unfortunately they are detected and Marr is sent to prison. It is years later and Bishop Robert Redford is a legitimate security consultant who is kidnapped because he has stolen a 'Black Box' which can hack into the most secure and sensitive centers of the world. His team consists of other specialists like Donald Crease Sidney Poitier Erwin Emory David Strathairn 'Mother' Dan Aykroyd and River Phoenix as Carl. They have decided to take on the Government agents who are holding Bishop. The problem multiples when the C.I.A. takes an active interest as does Bishop's former friend who seeks his own bit of revenge. The movie is interesting and lively as the level of danger grows until everyone is in danger including the real U.S. government. Easily recommended as a wonderful but serious film. ".

Granted I may be a little biased having grown up surfing in Northern CA paddling out at many of those spots and looking up to the big wave chargers such as Jay but based on entertainment value alone I thought it was great. The acting was solid footage was incredible and story never dragged on or lost my attention. The film portrayed a reasonably realistic vibe of Santa Cruz as a high school kid and the often not discussed elements of surfing. I thought it was great that they were able to bring in the real pioneers of Mavs and local shapers.The only downcheck was that it did feel slightly 'karatekidish' at times and there were a few events that would be incredibly rare that all seemed to happen at opportune moments.Perhaps this movie won't appeal as much to many who don't have a passion for the sport or appreciate the massive undertaking of paddling out in heavy surf  but I found it very entertaining. The story may not have been 100 accurate but the point is to pay respect to and tell the story of an extremely driven and all around good guy.".

	schema:reviewBody "This enjoyable movie is recommended especially for those who love surfing and the sea.It tells the true story of Jay Moriarity played by Jonny Weston a young Santa Cruz surfer who conquered Mavericks during El Nino one of the highest waves in the world. The heart of the movie is the relationship between him and his fatherfigure and surfing mentor Frosty Hesson played by Gerard Butler. Jay has no father but he's a good kid a real winner actually and he latches onto Frosty. We follow Jay as he learns some of Frosty's rules of life and applies them to accomplish this incredible feat at the age of 16.Frosty's rules of life and intense training routine seemed rather bang on to me. This is the kind of thing that moulds young winners. It explains why Jay was able to conquer Mavericks. I accept the movie's moral live like Jay.I enjoyed the scenes showing surfing and surfing life. I identified strongly with young Jay's struggles with his family and friends and with his drive unusual for a kid his age to do this amazing and dangerous thing. This is a comingofage story that spoke to me. This is by no means a perfect movie but its downsides are relatively minor. The movie has a slight afterschoolspecial quality. It's a movie completely acceptable for kids. Parents should be forcing their kids to see this one.For me one issue is that Jonny Weston was too old to play a 16 year old. He has a younglooking face but when he took his shirt off you could see he was at least 5 years older than that. However apart from that he was perfectly cast and played his role excellently.At the end of the film we find out that Jay died in 2001 at the age of 22. This also explains why Jay is portrayed as such a beautiful and perfect kid struggling with the imperfect people around him. The movie is a sort of eulogy to him. After watching the movie Jay's death does feel like a huge loss.Once again a score on IMDb just seems inexplicably wrong to me. The few reviews so far are positive but the scores apparently are not. The moviegoers voting this movie down are not writing reviews to explain their voting.There is nothing wrong at all with this slightly sappy movie about a young hero. It's a fine movie that deserves better ratings.".

Chasing Mavericks deals with people coming to terms with massive gaps in their lives but somehow focusing on something bigger than themselves to pull through. If you love surfing or the ocean this movie is for you. Mavericks was brought to world wide attention with Stacey Peralta's film Riding Giants. Jay has lost his father early in life and has to act as a pseudo parent for his mother who suffers from the breakup. He accidentally discovers that his much older neighbour Frosty is a big wave surfer and so a teacher mentor relationship starts. Frosty as well has terrible father issues which continue to plague him. Their relationship develops momentum and gives each of them energy and purpose. The film underlines the choices we can make in life. Everyone has scars and issues to deal with. Do we give up and spiral downwards or do we set big goals waves and go after them. Jay plans carefully in his room to conquer his fears and reach his goal. Excellent and heartfelt acting.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you want to watch a movie with a fresh point of view on the world and enjoy every minute of it I highly recommend watching Chasing Mavericks. Chasing Mavericks is the type of movie that will make you feel alive. Not only me but many of the other people watching it in the theater were so moved that you would actually they would move with the waves in the movie. The movie approaches the theme of love family and freedom in a very natural way something that we rarely see in any other movies of this decade. It's very inspirational and motivating yet it's very real and natural so you get inspired without being lectured. My hat's off to the person who first came up with the idea of having Gerard Butler play the role of Frosty because no other actor could pull it off so perfectly. Butler's character is a mentor father figure and yet he does seem larger than life a character that I can call Poseidon the god of the seas. Aside from that this is one of those rare movies that resonates father and son relationship which is really good to see for a change. Grown men including me were actually crying when they watched some emotional scenes and this rarely happens. I highly recommend this movie to everyone who wants to reconnect with their emotions and thoughts.".

It's a must see and take the kids there are some kissing scenes but they are brief and not graphic. No swearing or anything.

And the scenes around Santa Cruz brought back good memories. It was a throwback to those movies that were not CG'd out action flicks superheros etc. all of which I love BTW. It has a homegrown feeling with interesting colors and nice photography. I lived in the Santa Cruz surfing scene although not a surfer myself and really enjoyed the memories of hearing about Mavericks.Very cool movie about a good and amazingly talented young surfer and his mentor.

A close relationship to both the surf in Northern California's Pacific and to the man who trains him how to survive its largest beast this big wave film highlights some of the most interesting parts of big wave surfing psychology. Fear love loss... and finding a balance amidst it all. Drop into theaters to see Maverick's on the big screen  that should be reason enough.

I found it a beautiful story of people the challenge of relationships mixed with the thrill of surfing and the athletic abilities required for the champions.From the heart this is a true story of a young man Jay Jonny Weston who in spite of many things against him manages to make his dream come true based on hard work. It is also the story of another man Frosty Gerard Butler who has his own personal challenges comes to terms with some of those and builds a relationship with a young man who needs a father. I was particularly impressed by Brenda Abigail Spencer Frosty's wife who simply loved him. Maybe a strange statement but when you see the film you will understand.Definitely worth seeing!".

The story of Jay is such an inspiring one and it is done quite well as far as surf films go. Similar to the story of Stacy Peralta in Lords of Dogtown he is an outcast who wants to turn a blind eye to the dark side of those teenage years that many are captured by. Bullies drugs violence all play their part in the film but what is touching is the father son relationship that is developed with Frosty and Jay. Overall it is a great film with lots of heart and few unexpected twists and as in many surf films its fun for us surfers to pick out the cameos of pro surfers and Chasing Mavericks did not disappoint. Peter Mel Greg Long and tonnes more mentioned in the closing credits. I think this film got surfing right with the escapist attitude and how surfing is more of a love affair with the ocean as opposed to a simple sport. It will leave you inspired and wanting to jump right into the water to Live Like Jay.P.S. Only bad thing is no mention of Jeff Clark. A little bummed at first but I got over it ".

In this sense it has more of the feel of an independent film. The cinematography is excellent and the storyline inspiring. Set in funky Santa Cruz CA in the 80's and 90's the surfer culture of this special corner of Northern California was wellcaptured.

Instead you feel like both your time and money were well spent on watching the movie and you receive all these positive messages of hope and the inspiration to overcome challenges in your life. Simultaneously an admiration for the extreme sport lifestyle especially scuba diving and surfing is also kindled.Good overall execution  great acting by Gerard Butler the lady who plays his wife and the protagonist.

Some of us chase our dreams of going to college or becoming a football player or a Lawyer. And there are others that dream of chasing the biggest wave like Jay Moriarity he lived for riding those waves for pushing himself to become strong enough for the Mavericks. The imagery in this movie is outstanding it pulls you into the sea and sucks you deep into the beauty of the water. It makes you feel and see the details of the scene makes you long to run your fingers through the surface of the tide to inhale the fresh scent of sea air. Chasing Mavericks makes you realize the importance of living everyday to the fullest to love those around you while you have the chance to do so because each day is numbered and to never let the 'distance' of our own problems draw us away from those we love most. This movie also shows us the effect of fatherhood on our younger generation how our boys and girls desperately need the strong leadership of rolemodels from fathers. How without the guidance of a father figure many of us will never reach the dream of 'riding the Mavericks.' How the loss of our fathers become our biggest 'fears' they hold us back from achieving what we want most. Acceptance and love.Jay defines all the odds reaches the goals of what he was created for he lives his life to the very fullest and changes the lives of so many others along the way.

	schema:headline " Chasing Mavericks The Phenomenal Surfing Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "In my opinion Chasing Mavericks is the best surf movie that has actually captured the magic and excitement of surfing. From the incredible inspiring story of Jay Moriarty to the magnificent Maverick waves this movie is enchanting for the whole family. This movie shows flabbergasting perseverance a beautiful and heartwarming story about the young man Jay Moriarty played by Jonny Weston and it also shows the benefits and accomplishments when Jay chased his dreams. Predictably no one can just go to Mavericks and actually survive a wave there without any training. In the movie Jay never gave up. Frosty played by Gerad Butler didn't ease up on Jay's training. Frosty pushed Jay to the limit to prepare Jay for the monstrous waves of Mavericks. The going got tough with Jay's training however Jay kept on pushing harder and harder. Jay went through some hardships in his life but he did not let those lock him up or hold him back. Jay's dad left him and his mom when Jay was just a little boy. Also Jay's mom had a little trouble holding a job down and paying rent on their house. This didn't put a halt at all to his dreams. If you want to see a movie about perseverance and never giving up on your dreams do me a favor and go see Chasing Mavericks. Relatively I am a surfer like Jay. Seeing this movie about Jay's surfing life i can really relate to it. The director did an amazing job at capturing the feeling of a surfer when you drop in on the wave you are dying to surf. My personal friend is close friends with the actual Frosty. He said that Frosty was on set at all times making sure they were getting the footage right. Frosty also told them when to come to capture the Mavericks waves. At 300 in the morning Frosty once called the directors Micael Apted and Curtis Hanson to ask them where they are and why weren't they at Mavericks yet. The directors started laughing and told him they were sleeping. Frosty argued that the waves were at best at Mavericks right now. The footage was amazing though and really captured the emotions and troubles Jay went through. As I said before Jay's dad left him and his mother when Jay was just a little tike. One day Jay decides to go and surf and borrows some fins from Frosty. He can't quite get up but a nice kid in the water helps him out. The two boys later become best friends. Sometimes the waters got rough in their relationship but in the end Jay's best friend was there for him. At the end of Jay's training Jay feels as if Frosty is a father to him. Frosty is more than excited when Jay catches and successfully surfs a enormous wave at Mavericks. When seeing this movie your heart will definitely be warmed by this incredible story. On the other hand there is little tweaks I would make to this movie. I would not change any of the actors because they all did an impeccable job. I would change some of the song choices and have more modern music so people get into the movie. Otherwise everyone that worked on the movie and participated in the movie did an ample job. Also they set a great mood for this movie. Eventually after Jay's memorable wipe out and then great ride he became famous. He had chased his dream of riding a wave at Mavericks. He felt accomplished and self confident. But unlike other people Jay did not let this fame get to his head. There is a saying that many people say because of this and the selfless life he lived. The quote is Live like Jay. Sadly Jay died at the age of twentytwo while free diving alone. Jay was down there for too long and just couldn't hold his breath any longer. When diving you should always bring someone because if something happens like that you have someone to help you or to get help. Jay's life is a great example of how to live your life. In conclusion the newly released flick Chasing Mavericks is an adept and inspiring movie. If you had the chance to live like Jay would you? The answer is definitely yes for me. You will not regret seeing this movie. In the future I hope to become as good as a surfer and a person as Jay. So can you do me a favor world? Go see this incredible movie and live like Jay in honor of him!".

	schema:reviewBody "Chasing Mavericks is the story of 15 year old Jay Moriarty who wants to be trained to surf the Mavericks break nearby his house. in order to do so he gets help from the legendary neighbour Frosty Hesson played by the ever so genius Gerard Butler.Because of this people might see it as a typical surf movie and as such it has received some bad reviewing in the past. However I don't agree with it at all and blame it on the only explanation possible some critics might be jealous at Jay and his incredible lifestyle. At just 16 years old he achieves his primary goal in life surfing the Mavericks wave to be able to feel alive. In fact it is not at all about the actual surfing. Yes content wise it is. But looking at it from only that perspective is doing this great movie much to short since this movie is about achieving a main goal in life. Achieving something you want more than anything else in the world. It's about love friendship parenthood died everlasting glory and fame and more. Like I said stating that this movie is just about surfing is not true although i due see how it might inspire some people to start surfing as well. And to be honest you can see that young Jay knows what he is doing and that shows on screen. Nevermind the beautiful scenery of California coastlines. Furthermore is this movie based on true life which is always a plus for me and this movie provides the perfect mix between dramatic tension humour and emotion. It is a story which inspires others and this goes most certainly for this movie as well. I guess that for many people viewing this movie the words LIFE LIKE JAY will stay in their heads a long time. Lastly i want to give create for the great editing of the movie and the great use of music. this movie did not only provide me with a great time at looking at it but also with several new great bands which i never had heard of before. For example Blue light and FADE INTO YOU of Mazzy Star are 2 great songs which I have learned about. To finish off i want to say that this is one of the greatest movies of 2012 and that i'm not a surfer and that I didn't know Mazzy Star before this movie. life like jay!Greetings from Glenn".

This film demonstrates some excellent footage of the ocean and some pretty incredible waves. It seemed to capture the true nature of the California surfing scene maintains its true beauty and danger simultaneously. This story never lost my interest as it remained quite true to the original story of Jay and Frosty. The real Frosty Hesson even appeared in the movie despite it being a small role that he wasn't even credited for. In my opinion it was cast perfectly. I couldn't possibly envision anyone else in either the role of Jay or Frosty. Both Gerard Butler as Frosty and Johnny Weston as Jay portrayed their characters with incredible heart and emotion. They did a solid job of demonstrating their characters and the relationships they had not just with each other but with the rest of the supporting cast as well. This is a wonderful film that incorporated aspects of a great drama and a great sport movie seamlessly. It's full of amazing life lessons and helpful surfing tips as well. This film tackled the issues of love family determination fear and freedom in an impeccable and incredibly natural manner.All in all this is a fantastic film that is most definitely worth a watch.".

	schema:headline " Can you say CHEESE???";
	schema:reviewBody "There are all kinds of sons. Some are born to you some just occur to you.Chasing Mavericks is based on the life of Jay Moriarity a young surfer who at the age of 15 managed to surf one of the biggest waves in California during the tropical storm El Nio. Unfortunately the film is full of clichs and one dimensional characters. I don't have any complaints with the scenes that take place in the Ocean the big waves and surfing scenes are fun to look at. I didn't find it hard to believe that this kid could surf such big waves what I found hard to believe is that this kid would act and speak the way he did as the rest of the characters in the film. The dialogue here was just awful and it only took me half a minute to realize that after the terrible opening narration by Gerard Butler saying We all come from the sea but we are not all of the sea. I don't think the film does justice to the rest of the people involved in the surfing community either. They pretty much made all his friends look like complete jerks with the exception of two or three people. Chasing Mavericks is completely predictable and at the same time very cheesy. You have this opening scene where you see Jay at age 8 on his way to surf and he runs into a boy smashing cars with his baseball bat who looks mad at him. Then seven years later Jay is all grown up surfing like a champ and he runs into this guy making fun of him with a bat on his hand. It doesn't get much cheesier than that. The scenes in the water are great but each time you see these guys in land you are left disappointed. I don't think this film depicts the surfer culture very well. If you want to see a good surf movie go see Bigelow's 1991 Point Break which is a much better film than this. I'm sure Moriarity was a great guy and he deserves a much better film than this. Jay Moriarity Jonny Weston lives in a small Californian coastal town with his single mother Kristy Elisabeth Shue. Jay enjoys what any other normal teenager living off the coast of California loves to do surf and he has an exceptional talent for it. He has always admired the local surfing legend Frosty Gerard Butler who happened to save his life once when he was a child. When Jay discovers that the Mavericks surf break exist just miles from his home he asks for his help to train him. Jay has dreamt of surfing these gigantic waves all of his life but Frosty is not up to the task considering it is far too dangerous for the kid. His wife Brenda Abigail Spencer on the other hand convinces Frosty to help Jay since he's always looked up to him as a father figure. Knowing that Jay will probably try to surf the waves on his own she convinces Frost to help him. Soon student and teacher will be training together to accomplish a task that seems impossible. They have 12 weeks before the big waves hit the coast once again. Jay begins training really hard for this and during his free time he spends it with his childhood sweetheart Kim Leven Rambin with whom he's had a crush on for years. The training sessions help Jay grow as a person as he draws closer and closer to Frosty as a father figure who teaches him to face his fears.The film was directed originally by Curtis Hanson LA Confidential and 8 Miles but due to health problems he had to abandon the project and Michael Apted Gorillas in the Mist Nell took over during the final production weeks. I was surprised something this bad could come out of such talented directors but the main problem in my opinion was the script from Kario Salem. The characters and dialogues were extremely cheesy at times. It just tries too hard to be inspirational. This biopic felt way too much dramatized at times. The Mavericks surf footage aren't enough to save this melodramatic sports biopic. There is nothing unique or fresh about the friendship between Jay and Frosty everything is full of clichs. The film was much better on water than it was on land due in large part to the bad script and some bad acting from the supporting cast.

I may be wrong and surfers might like this movie but I don't think this film really reflects that surfing culture in the way it intends to.

	onyx:emotionText "There are all kinds of sons. Some are born to you some just occur to you.Chasing Mavericks is based on the life of Jay Moriarity a young surfer who at the age of 15 managed to surf one of the biggest waves in California during the tropical storm El Nio. Unfortunately the film is full of clichs and one dimensional characters. I don't have any complaints with the scenes that take place in the Ocean the big waves and surfing scenes are fun to look at. I didn't find it hard to believe that this kid could surf such big waves what I found hard to believe is that this kid would act and speak the way he did as the rest of the characters in the film. The dialogue here was just awful and it only took me half a minute to realize that after the terrible opening narration by Gerard Butler saying We all come from the sea but we are not all of the sea. I don't think the film does justice to the rest of the people involved in the surfing community either. They pretty much made all his friends look like complete jerks with the exception of two or three people. Chasing Mavericks is completely predictable and at the same time very cheesy. You have this opening scene where you see Jay at age 8 on his way to surf and he runs into a boy smashing cars with his baseball bat who looks mad at him. Then seven years later Jay is all grown up surfing like a champ and he runs into this guy making fun of him with a bat on his hand. It doesn't get much cheesier than that. The scenes in the water are great but each time you see these guys in land you are left disappointed. I don't think this film depicts the surfer culture very well. If you want to see a good surf movie go see Bigelow's 1991 Point Break which is a much better film than this. I'm sure Moriarity was a great guy and he deserves a much better film than this. Jay Moriarity Jonny Weston lives in a small Californian coastal town with his single mother Kristy Elisabeth Shue. Jay enjoys what any other normal teenager living off the coast of California loves to do surf and he has an exceptional talent for it. He has always admired the local surfing legend Frosty Gerard Butler who happened to save his life once when he was a child. When Jay discovers that the Mavericks surf break exist just miles from his home he asks for his help to train him. Jay has dreamt of surfing these gigantic waves all of his life but Frosty is not up to the task considering it is far too dangerous for the kid. His wife Brenda Abigail Spencer on the other hand convinces Frosty to help Jay since he's always looked up to him as a father figure. Knowing that Jay will probably try to surf the waves on his own she convinces Frost to help him. Soon student and teacher will be training together to accomplish a task that seems impossible. They have 12 weeks before the big waves hit the coast once again. Jay begins training really hard for this and during his free time he spends it with his childhood sweetheart Kim Leven Rambin with whom he's had a crush on for years. The training sessions help Jay grow as a person as he draws closer and closer to Frosty as a father figure who teaches him to face his fears.The film was directed originally by Curtis Hanson LA Confidential and 8 Miles but due to health problems he had to abandon the project and Michael Apted Gorillas in the Mist Nell took over during the final production weeks. I was surprised something this bad could come out of such talented directors but the main problem in my opinion was the script from Kario Salem. The characters and dialogues were extremely cheesy at times. It just tries too hard to be inspirational. This biopic felt way too much dramatized at times. The Mavericks surf footage aren't enough to save this melodramatic sports biopic. There is nothing unique or fresh about the friendship between Jay and Frosty everything is full of clichs. The film was much better on water than it was on land due in large part to the bad script and some bad acting from the supporting cast. The film might have its heart in the right place but it just doesn't work. I may be wrong and surfers might like this movie but I don't think this film really reflects that surfing culture in the way it intends to. You know there has to be a problem with the film when it's easier to believe the surfing of the gigantic waves' scenes than the actual family drama.httpestebueno10.blogspot.com";

	schema:reviewBody "Serious spoilers ahead !This is a very wellmade thriller. After first watching it seemed not to make any sense at all to me and I got quite angry at it. But then I went back to it and patiently went through some of the scenes again to catch the detailed hints. Man it sure isn't easy to figure them out ! Hollywood thrillers are very in your face with plot hints. This one is far more subtle and the viewers have to really catch the details themselves.Since there are many negative comments here because of the impenetrable plot twists I will list what I found out so far it's really more of a puzzle than a straightforward thriller think The usual suspectsAt the beginning of the film the detective removes a button from the dead body of a boy who fell out of a window the other one is missing. The missing button is the one he sees Chae put into the drawer in the video towards the end of the movie. When he gets into the room 702 where the victims were dissected he imagines how she pushed the boy off the window. She does it because the boy had been spying on her. Without this link the detective wouldn't know Chae was in that place so it is crucial.On the photo there are the two women Chae and Seungmin Oh together will all the male victims each holding a bottle with fish similar to the one that Chae gave to the detective before she left for Paris towards the end. They are standing in front of a water tank. When the detective first went to the home in the woods where Chae was hiding after being attacked this tank was briefly shown. It was not recognizable as such but the metal corners were standing out. The detective remembered it from the photo.The tools that were packed and removed from the room 702 where the detective's partner was killed were found in Seungmin Oh's apartment by the police before the scene at Tower records. Therefore she was the one who killed him.The body missing the head inside the tank is Chae's father's. His head was in the freezer that the detective's partner found just before he was killed. Over the phone he informed the detective that the head was Chae's father's. His killer Seungmin Oh removed the head from the freezer before leaving. This implies that both women were using the room 702 for the killings. They were partners in those crimes. Seungmin Oh has burn scars on her legs shown before she leaves for Tower records. She is Chae's childhood friend who set the house on fire. Chae was lying when she said that friend was a boy in order to cover up Seungmin Oh her partner in crime.The men were all former boyfriends of Chae according to what she said. However they are shown united on the photo together with Chae and Seungmin Oh. They are standing in front of the tank that contains Chae's father's dead body in celebrating pose. This implies they must all have been complicit in killing him. Her father was the first victim and contrary to the others his body was kept hidden. From the way he was portrayed the former boyfriends must have had reason to hate him also she must have manipulated them in wanting to murder her father.The plastic bag that led back to her father was placed to make her father the main suspect for the killing of the young men. Presumably the two women killed them in order to stain Chae's father's reputation he is a very famous artist. Things went wrong with this plan when the detective's partner discovered her father's head in the freezer just before he was killed and informed the detective about it. Knowing that her father was dead he wasn't a suspect any longer for the police. This was the point where Seungmin Oh understood that their plan was unraveling.The person in the car who was attacking the detective in the rainy night after he finds one of the victim's place is Seungmin Oh. The police towards the end identify her as the owner of a car that was caught speeding on that night.Seungmin Oh knows that the police has tracked her down after seeing them at her workplace. To draw attention away from Chae she spills the blood in the bathtub and makes it evident that she is the murderer. She still wants to cover Chae.Chae's call to the detective telling him she will meet Senguin at Tower records is a setup. She says just because I was thinking of you which is not typical for her. He was supposed to kill Seungmin this was the plan of both women.There is an enigmatic short scene 30 min before the end where Chae and Seungmin Oh meet for dinner together with some young men just after the killing of the detective's partner. Seungmin asks Chae Did you really go to the hospital to die ? You are not the suicidal type. It looks rather like a memory and the men present at the dinner might have been the victims. It might imply that the women were ready for suicide but that Chae wanted out and that Seungmin was ready to take the blame in order to give her an alibi.All in all it started to make sense to me after moving through the film back and forth on my ipad. This is the first time I had to do this to understand a movie. While it was frustrating at the beginning this is all looking a lot more interesting now.Finally the original title is Telmisseomding and was translated to Tell me something. Much rather it might mean They'll miss something.".

	schema:reviewBody "TELL ME SOMETHING I'm truely surprised that the Korean cinema hasn't caught on here in America. From what I've seen from them I've never been let down. First there was SHIRI a big budget terrorists vs the government Hollywood style movie. Then the spectacular MUSA and well you know my feelings on that one. It was just fantastic. One of my favorite movies of all time. Next was BICHUNMOO a grand martial arts Kung Fu Theatre epic. Then NO. 3 aka NUMBER 3 KILLER a quirky gangster PULP FICTION type of film. And now we have CHANG YOON HYUN's TELL ME SOMETHING a very good serial killer murder mystery flick. It's also what I call a Sunday afternoon movie. You know it's 6 or 7 pm and there's nothing on television to watch so you nab a nice thought provoking drama or crimesuspense flick from the video store and you kick back and watch it. Director DAVID FINCHER's movies like THE GAME and SE7EN are good examples. And this is just as good. But what's so special about this particular one is that you not only get a great thinking movie storyline it also supplies the pleasant blood and gore that most Hollywood films of this sort only hint to or simply happen offscreen. HAN SUK KYU from SHIRI and NO. 3 stars as troubled police detective Cho on the trail of a terrible serial killer that chops up the bodies of the victims and spreads them throughout the city in black plastic garbage bags. But the niffty new trick here is to mix them up. In bag 1 you may get the arms head and heart of victim A. In bag 2 located somewhere else you find the legs from victim A but they're mixed up with the guts and hands of victim B. Then in bag 3 there's the head and heart of victim B with the legs and guts from victim C. And so on and so on. Get the picture? So after discovering several bags and finally piecing them together like a puzzle to identify the corpses he finds one link between them all a lovely young museum currator named SuYeon actress SHIM EUN HA. She's had affairs with all the male victims at one time or another so maybe she's gotta be the killer right? Well as I said before this is more of a thinking movie so it's never who you'd expect. There'll be plenty of other suspects to point the finger at as the movie goes on. So without giving away any more details that may spoil the movie I'll wrap this review up rather short. All in all this was just another example of how good the Korean film industry has been for me. I hope they continue to impress and maybe just maybe they'll find a home here in America.".

I'm an AngloAmerican but have grown up in Hawaii a deeply Asianinfluenced region. I think that makes a big difference in how you receive this movie. It has obvious American undertones but sustains an Asian cultural subtext that some may not understand. The gore is secondary. Dialogue too. Movement real acting and phenomenal shooting makes this an event not just a movie. The director actors and even the lighting crew is showing us not telling us a fantastic story.The troubled cop beginning of this movie might feel problematic to some but if you think about it it really is telling you to not believe everything you think. You think this is going to be a film about one thing and it is about another thing. You think the killer is one character and it is another. Using all available to the genre and medium the director wastes nothing. He uses music cinemotagraphy location lighting and pacing to convey time feeling and motive or inspiration if you will. Nothing is rushed and nothing is obvious. I loved that the longing the cop and the victim have for each other is so subtle so quiet. It's almost smoldering and chaste at the same time.The twists are fantastic too. You are lead in one direction and you think Ah ha. That's who I thought it was. and then you are told that is not correct. You are left secondguessing yourself to the very end.A lot of people may feel unsatisfied with the ending because it doesn't tie everything up in a pretty bow. Why did the killer kill? What happens next? How did it happen? I like that. There is nothing more disturbing than being treated like a bumbling idiot by a director or screen writer. I want to think. I want to question. Just like the old saying if you have to have a joke explained to you you don't get it. This movie needs no explanation. It needs critical thinking people to watch it. Just like reality not everything is explained. This is a thinkingperson's thriller. I certainly hope Hollywood does not remake this film. It is perfect the way it is with it's Asian sensibilities and rhythm. I loved it!It certainly is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time and probably the best thriller in recent memory.".

Not until the last few minutes did that become clear  well as clear as it could be given the narrative structure reminiscent of the plot of Se7en 1995 but with the addition of a number of flashbacks that do more to confuse than to wholly satisfy.And there are obvious nods to not only Se7en but Silence of the lambs 1991 also particularly the cinematography and scene construction. At one point echoing a scene from the former Detective Cho Suhkyu Han is lying exhausted in a rainsoaked alley way while the killer sits waiting in his car only two metres away but instead of running Cho down the killer screams away into the rain. In another scene Cho is in an elevator and looks up to see bright blood dripping from the hatchway and then also dripping down the wall suddenly the hatch breaks and buckets of blood cascade onto him. Add to that are the many interior scenes in rundown tenements and so forth all evocative of the spooky corridors of those earlier films.Still the story is interesting in a macabre way across Seoul body parts turn up in black plastic bags but not all parts belong to the body. Somebody is perpetrating murder piecemeal. Enter Detective Cho somewhat under suspicion for corruption but handed the case as way to redeem his career. More mixedup body parts are discovered but no hands with fingerprints. So no clues. Until a head appears with teeth fillings that can be traced. One thing leads to another until Cho finds himself knocking on the door to Chae SuYeon Eunha Shim a young woman who knows all the male victims.And so begins the real mystery for Cho  and the viewer. Through questioning and a series of flashbacks it looks like Chae is in the frame yet murders continue while she is under surveillance. Suspicion falls upon her father who from Chae's account is shown to be a sadistic authoritarian figure but he can't be found. And then there's a further nod to another thriller Kiss the girls 1997 where the idea of a deadly duo is raised and then quashed when a prime suspect is himself reduced to a jumble of parts in a bag. All very messy for Cho and increasingly so because he appears to be attracted to the sweet Chae SuYeon a complication he can do without you would think.In a way I can also compare this film to the manner in which David Lynch constructs his films. When you see any of the more recent Lynch films the real mystery and challenge is how to understand the story. For Tell Me Something the problem is how to understand the mystery because as I said the killer's motivations is the key. And yet at the end there is no absolute clarity even though the identity is obvious. So if I provide my understanding here and now I think that would detract from the pleasure of unraveling it for yourself. Meanwhile I'll continue to ponder the significance of the title the significance of which escapes me.However the production is excellent and the special effects dismembered bodies body pieces heads gutted torsos and so on are so realistic they may cause some people more than just some discomfit. It will certainly satisfy the slashandgore set who liken this movie to Italian giallo cinema exemplified by Dario Argento's works such as Deep Red 1977 Tenebre 1982 and others. It's classified as a horror film and I think that's justified given the underpinnings of the story and the camera work.I can't comment much on the acting as I'm not familiar with the actors or Korean cinema having seen only a few generally however I think the actors performed quite well.Recommended for those who like a mixed bag of horror mystery and thriller...and body parts.".

And all you need to know is that this is the BEST serial thriller to come along since The Silence of the Lambs...it's better than Seven it's better than Copycat and it's even better than The Crimson Rivers. In fact I would rate this top notch film on the same level as Dario Argento's Deep Red and Tenebre...and for those of you fortunate enough to have seen those classic films..yes it really is THAT good! Yet whereas acting and even the screenplay are secondary to classic Italian thrillers this gem boasts an exquisitely constructed screenplay the ending will surely take you by surprise! and two outstanding lead performances by the commandingly handsome Sukkyu Han and the breathtakingly beautiful Eunha Shim.Sadly Tell Me Something has yet to get a US release outside of all too rare arthouse screenings from time to time and after two years it remains unreleased on VHS or DVD. So I would HIGHLY recommend that you all purchase the codefree NTSC Hong Kong DVD. The AV transfer is stunning and the English subtitles get a surprisingly accurate translation.I have no idea why none of the Hollywood studios have yet given this film a theatrical release but like the equally brilliant Japanese horror film RING I'm guessing it's because they are first planning an American remake...so before that dark day comes experience for yourself the film that I consider the Best Movie of 1999 besting even The Matrix and one of the Top 5 HorrorThrillers of the decade!My Grade A".

While the acting is superb and the atmospheric scenery is only rivaled by the American film Seven it's plot falls weak towards the end.  It all comes together and makes sense at the end but there is something disturbing about it.  We know there are atleast 2 killers for shear continuity reasons.  Because Detective Oh Yes that is his name dies while the main villain is in the custody of the lead detective.  Side note not to sound stereotypical I admire the Asian community a great deal but that is the only problem I have with watching Asian film.  The names do not stick out because they are all almost the same.  With the exception of Detective Oh.  So my appologies on not naming anyone other than Detective Oh.  Anyway what we do not know is why in the hell she wanted to attack the lead villain in Tower Records.  We do not know why the family back story turns into a big mess at the end.  We do not know why the lead killer would leave evidence of a drastic nature behind.  Nor do we know why that eerie painting did not raise the attention of the police when the knew good and well a head would turn up next.  I don't know maybe the subtitles we not translated well enough.  Maybe if I knew Korean I would understand the film better.  Maybe if I saw the film outside the US it would have had scenes that America did not show.   What I do know This is a great cinematic achievement both visually and acted.  The film has some great special effects such as what I am sure is real animals blood.  You see Eastern film is so uncompromising because they do not have to deal with a disturbingly PC Hollywood community.  Anyway the only flaws may lie in the American cut so I cannot go below an 8.  I believe the film made since in Korea.  If anyone knows where I can get a subtitled Director's Cut of this film please let me know.  It breaks my heart to give this film less than a 9.".

	schema:headline " Grisly serial killer tale from Korea";
	schema:reviewBody "Black plastic bags of human body parts swimming in blood are found in various places in the city of Seoul in South Korea. Police investigates them and soon sees they belong to various victims and are mixed together in order to confuse the minds of those that are investigating. A mysteriously silent and beautiful female becomes number one lead for them and target of police investigation and questions and the more the film runs the more we get closer to the truth and revealing the identity of the violent killer. Much more cannot be said about Korean film maker YoonHyun Chang's disturbing serial killer thriller Tell Me Something 1999 without spoiling its many surprises and plot turns coming.Unfortunately this film in my opinion and after my first viewing has more flaws and holes than real merits in it. First of all it is sadly too long as it runs 117 minutes in NTSC speed. That would be okay if the film had very interesting multileveled characters in it that would make the whole ride much faster and more fluent to sit through naturally. Now the characters don't develop too interestingly and also the film hasn't got any real message to deliver and thus is only a serial killer horror film not much else. Many have compared this to the US film maker David Fincher's masterful tale of wickedness living inside ourselves and our society Seven 1995 but that film is not only visually much more stunning and brilliant than Tell Me Something but also has its message and themes to make the whole piece much bigger and more noteworthy. I felt very bored during many scenes of this Korean film as they don't give anything to the film as a whole. They should have shortened the film by some 30 minutes without harming the end result. The typical traumatic childhood thing feels also pretty stupid and like it was just fastly written to give some kind of a motivation for the killer's act. Traumatic childhood and horrors related to it is a very serious subject matter in cinema and in a film like this it feels a little unnecessary and also even repellent. If they had given a more interesting and different explanation for the killer's acts it would be more interesting to watch even in this too long form.The positive things are also there fortunately and especially the few shock scenes like the head on the seat of the car are truly effective and done with great fast editing and merciless elements on the soundtrack. Worth mentioning is also the kubrickesque elevator scene that has a remarkably effective soundtrack behind it and making it stronger. The silent scenes and especially the face expressions and eyes of the female lead are also very impressive and once again show how much more powerful cinema can be without words silently. Also the scene inside some industrial building followed by a brutal murder is effective and uses the daytime setting empty room and distant sounds in the sountrack very effectively and gives also a strong feel of loneliness in such a big city. If they only had wanted to give us more than just murder mystery with this film of their's..The graphic horror elements are very strong in this film and the nastiness of them even surprised me. The film opens with a grisly depiction of dissection and nauseatingly realistic body parts and blood which are shown for several seconds in close ups without any other reason. Similar scenes follow and the film also includes one of the nastiest highway multi car accidents I've ever seen and that is definitely an unusually horrific scene! Also equally sudden and nasty is the elevator scene and these scenes involving bags full of body parts are as graphic and slippery as they just can be so the film makers seemingly wanted to deliver plenty of gore with this film. It all comes also a little gratuitous as sometimes the real suspense and other more noteworthy horror elements suffer and leave on the background due to these easier scenes. The film includes also one brutal killing that definitely belongs to the mentioned category of being noticably calculated. The scene is distantly close to the impalement killing in Japanese Toshihara Ikeda's disturbing masterpiece Evil Dead Trap 1988 a film that has wonderful soundtrack and equally wonderful and gruesome surreal imagery and terror atmosphere and on any level greater film than Tell Me Something.Tell Me Something has potential but doesn't use it as near as completely as would have been preferred. It will probably please most slasher and horror fans that like their films bloody and mysterious but if you're looking for a more intelligent and effective both mentally and physically piece then it will probably come as a more or less slight disappointment as it came to me. Still due to its few merits and overall Eastern status meaning there are NOT any stupid lightening entertainment elements usually found in for example modern Hollywood horror films make this to 410 category. And with capital G I would add.".

	onyx:emotionText "Black plastic bags of human body parts swimming in blood are found in various places in the city of Seoul in South Korea. Police investigates them and soon sees they belong to various victims and are mixed together in order to confuse the minds of those that are investigating. A mysteriously silent and beautiful female becomes number one lead for them and target of police investigation and questions and the more the film runs the more we get closer to the truth and revealing the identity of the violent killer. Much more cannot be said about Korean film maker YoonHyun Chang's disturbing serial killer thriller Tell Me Something 1999 without spoiling its many surprises and plot turns coming.Unfortunately this film in my opinion and after my first viewing has more flaws and holes than real merits in it. First of all it is sadly too long as it runs 117 minutes in NTSC speed. That would be okay if the film had very interesting multileveled characters in it that would make the whole ride much faster and more fluent to sit through naturally. Now the characters don't develop too interestingly and also the film hasn't got any real message to deliver and thus is only a serial killer horror film not much else.

I understand there is a homage to Seven and yes the technical side of the film is superb but the plot acting pacing length and direction leaves so much emptiness. I will be honest I have a problem of credibility with female serial killers they are as rare as having the winning ticket to the lottery whilst being hit by a meteorite but that could be over looked if the characters were interesting unfortunately they are not. The whole film lumbers and creaks and when finally it gets to its first surprise ending believe me it is not a surprise it's pretence and over use of slow motion is irritating rather than dramatic. After this the audience is left bored and uninterested when the killervictim leaves and lines up her next victim imagine Basic Instinct on Valium. Who actually watches this it was a huge success but I can't quite understand who it would appeal to.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a nutshell if you've seen five average gory suspense movies before you've seen this one. By the end you won't care.The movie has been described already in other posts so I won't get into that. What I do want to stress are the horrible characters and the buckets of clichs and plot devices.The movie starts out like any typical hack'em up suspense flick with moody music quick edits and lots of inyourface gore some plot and then some odd characters  the cast of suspects. These suspects are all acting totally wrong given the situation and that is why we suspect them. We never find out why they are acting weird except for the actual killer. One suspect goes on behaving suspiciously and letting the cops think what they will and it's never explained why. Another obvious suspect is totally ignored by the cops and is even left alone with the woman who knew all the slashedup victims.The police too are stupid way beyond Keystone Cops. They follow leads into apartments discover PIECES OF THE VICTIMS and just hang around alone poking through things without phoning for backup knowing the baddies could be back at any moment. This happens twice. Then when attacked in a dark alley by the murderer in a car while the murderer is threateningly  but patiently  gunning the engine in neutral apparently waiting for the cop to decide where to run the cop runs straight for a fence and the inevitable manclimbsfencewhilechasedbycar scene instead of calmly stepping back through the OPEN DOOR into the brick building he just came out of. He also neglects to take down the licence plate or apparently to tell the rest of the police department to look for that car in the area. It shows up again under the APARTMENT BUILDING of the woman they're trying to protect.And the pathetic attempt at pathos. There's a scene where one guy is crying  and i'm not making this up  while passionately squeezing a handful of semidigested peanuts.Nothing fits. There's no motive for the way the murderer is working. The police suddenly divine patterns of how the murderer tells the police who the next victim will be and if you've got two brain cells to rub together you know who's going to be marked for death next. The murderer gives away far too much information as if wanting to be caught but it doesn't play out that way at all.Positives. The acting by the main female lead was decent. There was nothing she personally could do about the script or the director or the other actors. There's lots of blood and other than the rubber arms all the gory props are at least reasonably believable.The movie generally looked good. It was appealing appropriate and professionally done up in post production. The music was good and I'd say some of it was a poor copy of the dramatic classical music in Old Boy but this movie was made first so maybe it was the inspiring predecessor.Anyway best avoided.".

	schema:reviewBody "The best scene in this movie involves a big plastic garbage bag left in an elevator. I don't want to spoil it but let's just say that while I was pretty antielevator beforehand now I wouldn't THINK of using one.  There are some other good scenes involving garbage bags but they lack the sheer claustrophobic intensity of the elevator scene. This is a sleek little thriller with elements borrowed in a truly cosmopolitan manner from Takeshi Kitano JeanJacques Beineix and Quentin Tarantino among others.  In classic Noir tradition it never seems to stop raining.  Back in the army I served with some guys who had just returned from Korea which they informed me has three kinds of weather  Hot as a m'f'er cold as a m'f'er and wet as a m'f'er.   This movie confirms at least onethird of their insight.   It's a series of serene surfaces punctuated with corpses mutilated to some extent or other but even the corpses exude a kind of serenity.  It struck me as a good movie to watch on an airplane if you're afraid of flying especially with a dubbed soundtrack like maybe Genetic World  by Telepopmusik.  Most of you have probably heard at least one tune from that CD Breathe it's in that car ad with the black guy driving around hallucinating various passengers.  The exotic stylized violence in the movie will distract you from the possibility of a mishap with the plane while you become tranquilizd by the almost beatific atmosphere and of course some really cute Korean chicks to look at.  Best of all the movie ends on an airplane so your movie reverie should transfer smoothly to real life especially if the stewardess comes gliding up to offer you a drinkhold on though I haven't been on an airplane since the Eighties do they even still serve alcohol?As for the plot  oh hell who knows or cares.   For the first five minutes it was fascinating with the cop getting grilled by the Korean equivalent of Internal Affairs because apparently a gangster named Park had been paying for his mother's nursing care.   This gangster if I remember right was never actually seen or mentioned again.   Then they introduced another promising theme with a serial killer playing musical body parts  but that also seemed to fall by the wayside once the heroine was introduced most of the rest of the flick was the cop swooning over her in various ways.  I stopped taking it seriously shortly afterwards.  In one sequence that was so bizarre I'm not even sure I remember it right the cop handed her his gun and then wandered off somewhere so he could get into some trouble for which his gun would have come in handy.  In an American or European movie it would've been funny but here it just left me scratching my head Gee I don't know they must have some unusual police procedures in the Orient.... There's no such thing as calling for backup it would seem.  Maybe that makes an Asian cop lose face?The film briefly threatened to come to life again in some late flashback scenes involving the heroine's eccentric artist father but these elements didn't pan out.  Ultimately we're left to draw our own conclusions.  Hey maybe the cop himself was the killer????  Or maybe he was dreaming the whole thing ... or the heroine was ... or the Red King  ... or Roy Orbison .... Damn I still miss him.    Maybe we need an Englishlanguage remake to straighten it all out?".

If I have to sit through a blood bath there sure as heck better be a towel at the end. SPOILER ALERT HERE Was there one killer or two?   I understood after a hellish amount of thinking that the Inchon Road referred to during the last 30 minutes was the address where Cho and Chae went and where she made the revelations about her brilliant father. I understood the part about the boy next door who was her only friend was really one of 6 daughters and had been burned in the fire that Daddy caused.  Got that.  Figured it out.  NOW  did the girls work together to off Dad or did they work with the other young men who eventually ended up dead as well.  Was Senguin you gotta love that name killing the young men to let Chae know who killed Daddy or was she ticked because after helping to kill Daddy Chae threw her over for these other guys?  ANd yeah why did they drop the plot about police corruption? Ohand who was the kid who fell from the building in the opening and what did his buttons or her buttons or someone's buttons have to do with anything?  Didn't the police notice that the apartment was a little bit funky when they went upstairs to check trajectory?  What were the cameras doing in Chae's apartment and who put them there?  END OF SPOILERS I THINKI've read other comments here hoping for enlightenment that suggest those of us who don't get it don't have the necessary intelligence to grasp the implications.  But gee whiz if as many people as are writing in are feeling stupid then there is definitely something being lost in the translation. All this flick needed was a blue box a key and a transexual murmuring silencio and the David Lynchiness would have been complete.".

	schema:reviewBody "TELL ME SOMETHING is a South Korean serial killer thriller as dark and depraved as you've expect from the genre following on from the success of Fincher's SE7EN in the mid 1990s. The movie charts the adventures of a detective on the hunt for a seriously warped psychopath who leaves bin bags full of body parts lying around in various parts of the city in an outlandishly gory setpiece early on one of the bin bags explodes in a lift full of commuters scattering limbs a head and a great deal of blood everywhere.It sounds mean and nasty and it is with the grubby atmosphere working just fine. But as the story goes on TELL ME SOMETHING commits a cardinal sin for this genre there's little to no detective work going on. Characters meet and leads are followed through contrivance or coincidence rather than the painstaking puttingtogether of clues and as a result the narrative drops down to a snail's pace. The movie subsequently follows the route of having the detective meeting a mysterious femme fatale linked to all the murders and from that point in it's a whodunit as the viewer strives to work out who the killer is.The film is an odd mix of effective scenes and boring scenes. There's a lack of narrative drive to the storyline which saps away a lot of the entertainment value it should have built up but on the other hand the grisly scenes do stick in the mind. The cast don't really make much of an impact the characters are never fully explored and of them all only Eunha Shim's sinister leading lady sticks in the mind recalling in some ways the villainess of Takashi Miike's outrageous AUDITION. In the end it feels overlong and a twist ending is predictable rather than surprising. Try THE CHASER if you want to see the Koreans do this kind of thing perfectly.".

Of course i could be overly kind and this was due to poor writing.....This left me with several questions.  Anyone have any answers????SPOILERS AHEADSo the floating body is that of the father right?What is it floating in? Someone on another message board called it a shower...but it looked like a big tank in the middle of the living room. Was it there the whole time they were investigating the murders? If so what was is portrayed as being every time the cops walked past it?In the Photograph they were all holding something.... what was it?  I could not make out the details on my TVMy thoughts are that the picture meant that all of the people in the picture participated in the killing of the father as some sort of group revenge lead by his daughter. Then I am thinking that the 2 women or just one killed all the guys because they hated men and also because all the later victims knew about the murder of the father. Thoughts?But then I'm still not sure why seeing this photograph leads the cop to go back to the apartment where he discovers the floating body. In the photo they are in front of where the body is found but there must be some clue that there is a body there that is to provide a reason the cop rushes back and promptly finds a body in the middle of a room he has been in dozens of times...but I was thinking that i just couldn't see it on my TV. In other words yes the photo shows that they were in cahoots but why go back to the apartment instead of tracking down the girl on her flight? Thoughts here?Thanks for any thoughts".

His vision is blurred from crying and in a reflection in the glass he spies a stranger in black with a snake bracelet whom he mistakes for someone else. Younghyun Chang uses this Argento sequence as his stepping off point to explore the blurred relationship between art and reality in 'Tell Me Something' 1999 aka Telmisseomding. A cloud hangs over the head of Lieutenant Cho and how he paid for his mothers' medical expenses. Why would Park pay an 85 million won bill for a detective trying to arrest him? is the question an internal affairs investigator asks Cho. Although the question of being guilty of taking a bribe is not resolved he does say to a colleague Detective Oh in one scene I still don't know if I did the right thing. To which Oh replies I'm sure you didn't want to go like that but a decision had to be made.A key scene with seeing watching and different ways of being seen involves the questioning of Suyeon Chae. Through various devices such as telemonitors and shots through internal windows we see him looking at her his partner looking at her and her looking at a video looking at pictures and we know that she knows. She knows things.In a nod to 'Giallo' pulp fiction origins Miss Chae after being installed in the Lieutenants house finds a note 'Call me if you need anything. There's a gun in the drawer.' In a neat piece of montage we are lulled by a waltz as the Lieutenant shows Miss Chae how to use the gun which is quickly followed by a sequence of mayhem on a freeway as a truck runs over one of the seemingly ubiquitous black garbage bags of body parts that are being dumped around the city.Miss Chae's friend Seungmin is a medical intern who seems like the most likely candidate from the get go you know her cheery countenance is guilty. She wears white all the time knows how to use a scalpel. Seungmin has long hair Chae short Chae is artistic Seungmin scientific. And let's not forget this is influenced by Dario Argento who likes to have an alternate killer in the background.An okay waterlogged thriller whose opening credits features a painting reminiscent of Rembrandt's 'The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp' 1632 which sets up Argento's fresco concern. In the first visit to Miss Chae's house we see a postcard sized reproduction to John Everett Millais' 'Ophelia' 1852 used similarly in Argento's 'Trauma' and 'The Stendahl Syndrome'. Later in Miss Chae's country family house there is a painting depicting her as 'Ophelia' from the Millais painted by her father.Argento like miseenscene can be found in an economically executed sequence in a crowded elevator and another garbage bag full of body parts. The exterior of Miss Chae's fathers house is reminiscent of the empty house in Deep Red. Instead of the children's scrawl on the wall we get a montage of photos of Miss Chae and a reproduction of the Rembrandt picture. Ultimately though the idea of scopophilia being sexual pleasure from looking gazing is how Argento seeps through this work. Worth a look.".

The dreary rain scenescape was similar to 'Seven' but I was willing to let that pass. But to start off the lead detective is accused of corruption then that subject along with his dead mother is dropped entirely after the first couple of scenes. Why was that necessary to reveal in the first place? The cop and his colleagues seemed to forget about it I certainly did. That was issue 2 Then as the story goes along the director again shows us that he has watched 'Seven' multiple times to include the very same scene where the cop almost catches the killer after going to their residence then is almost killed  but a cop goes without his gun? What  are you kidding me! Issue 3Issue 4 The doctor  was it a man or a woman? It seemed that the kid was a boy. But the grownup doctor seemed a woman. Maybe HeShe? is a transsexual and the female lead was hisher partner lover accomplice because they really hated men? But what really Really REALLY got under my skin issue 5 was the last 30 minutes where there were so many red herrings I thought this picture was filmed in a Swedish cannery! And some of them did not make logical sense. I am willing to give that perhaps something got lost in the translation  especially with dubbed voices! boo hiss But man this movie needed an editor BAD! Both director and editor needed to sit down and make sure that all the clues and pieces made sense. I'm not advocating that it be dumbed down Hollywoodstyle only that logical progression be applied. Coincidentally I had just seen 'Thesis' yesterday and the Spanish director Open Your Eyes remade as Vanilla Sky did such a superb job of subtly throwing off the viewer until the end that he could give lessons to this Korean director who just threw things out there for the sheer sake of it.But if you just wanna see some dead bodies and cool moody artifice then this is the flick for you. 'Seven' and 'Crimson Rivers' are still better movies though.".

	schema:headline " If Ralph Kramden  Ed Norton had been around in 1928";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a fairly obscure Laurel  Hardy comedy which deserves to be better known for while it's no masterpiece it is quite funny and entertaining as well as unusual in some respects. We Faw Down is one of the earliest explorations of Stan  Ollie's relationships with their wives and in 1933 it would serve as a blueprint for their best Battle of the Sexes feature Sons of the Desert. It plays rather like a silent version of The Honeymooners. Imagine Ralph Kramden  Ed Norton in this scenario the boys tell their wives a fib in order to sneak out and play poker but en route to the game they manage to get entangled with a boxer's flirty girlfriend later after narrowly escaping from the murderous boxer they make matters worse for themselves by blatantly lying about the whole episode to their wives who are now furious. The Gleason  Carney parallel with Laurel  Hardy has long been noticed but it's especially apparent here although in Laurel  Hardy's world it appears that forgiveness and understanding are harder to come by than in the Kramdens' apartment at the end of this film Mrs. Hardy is chasing the guys through an alley with a shotgun firing at them. It's hard to imagine Alice Kramden doing that.At any rate what we have here is a Roaring Twenties sitcom nicely photographed by George Stevens no less smoothly directed by Leo McCarey no less and beautifully well acted by the entire cast Stan and Ollie in particular. At their best Laurel  Hardy are so natural we don't even think of them as actors but what better definition is there of firstrate acting? As actors playing off each other the guys are at the top of their game in this short. Watch the interplay of their facial expressions in the opening scene as they conspire to fool their wives  they couldn't fool grade school kids but it's fun to watch them attempt to be sly. And later when the boys are semiinnocently ensnared by two good time gals there is a delightful extended sequence in which Stan is playfully tormented by the boxer's girlfriend to his mounting annoyance and Ollie's growing amusement.This is where the film gets into unusual territory at least for viewers accustomed to the later more childlike Laurel  Hardy. Although their characterizations are essentially in place in this early short Stan and Ollie are distinctly more grownup in their response to the sordid situation they get themselves into they're simpletons to be sure but grownups nonetheless. They're not entirely innocent and they exchange wicked conspiratorial grins throughout. Even in the final sequence when their story unravels and they stand revealed as liars they can barely conceal their impish amusement over the whole thing  and that's something you won't find later on as they became more infantile and more fearful of their wives. They do pay for their misbehavior here but at least they get some kicks along the way and that's kind of a treat. You might say that We Faw Down presents Laurel  Hardy at their naughtiest.Casting Note In this film Mrs. Laurel is played by Bess Flowers later to become famous  to movie buffs that is  as the Queen of the Hollywood Extras. She appeared in scores of movies throughout the entire Golden Age of the studio system usually as an elegantly attired dress extra. Just check out this woman's filmography it's amazing! We Faw Down provides Ms. Flowers with a rare opportunity to play comedy in a featured role and gives viewers a rare chance to get a look at this attractive lady for more than a few seconds. It's nice to see that she could hold her own with two of the top comedians in the business.".

This one is early on in their comedy pair years and I have never watched it before today since they never show silent films on syndicated TV I watched this on a collection I have I think from Kino. There were some laughter sound effects from the characters added in that worked good. Like I wrote this is very similar to Son's Of The Desert except the boys get themselves involved with a couple of really loose women not just dance girls like in SOTD and agree to go to their apartment to dry off your wet clothes. If you think that sounds racy you are correct this one is not for the kids. Ollie at one point tells Stan to be bohemian and make whoopie with a woman who is trying to kiss Stan. At one point he tells Ollie out loud I don't like her she's too fat! If you like racy Laurel and Hardy and who doesn't? then this may be the funniest material they have ever done. I have watched a few silent LH's before but this was the one that made me laugh the most it actually made me laugh more then most of their talkies as well! 9 out of 10 rating I only wish it had been longer!

	schema:reviewBody "Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so I am happy to see any of their films. Stan and Ollie have planned a poker game and they get their wives to believe they are going to see a show at the Orpheum Theatre. On their way to the game the boys help a woman get her hat blown off back and when they are soaked by a passing jet wash truck they take them to their place to dry off. Meanwhile Mrs. Hardy Vivien Oakland and Mrs. Laurel Bess Flowers get the newspaper reporting that the Orpheum has burned down and they go there to find out if their husbands got out. The boys are now in dressing gowns and Stan is being poked and having his hair messed with by one of the women laughing and saying whoopee and she only stops when he calls her fat and a jealous knife holding man chases him and Ollieout the window with their wives seeing everything. When the boys get back home the wives are sitting down listening to Ollie's lies as he explains what they got up to at the Orpheum with Stan miming some suggestions of what to say. Stan eventually sees the newspaper report about the Theatre and shows Ollies he also laughs at the excuse Ollie gives for not going there. One of the women comes round to give the boys their vests and they are chased out by their wives one of them shooting a gun and at the same time many other men only in vests and shorts are jumping out the window. Filled with good slapstick and all classic comedy you want from a black and white film it is an enjoyable silent film. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians' Comedian. Worth watching!".

The boys just wanted to play some poker with their friends at another house. But telling their wives they were going to a live theater they never made it to their poker date because they were diverted in trying to help a young lady retrieve her hat from under a car. Although Ollie pushed the car forward to allow an easy retrieval unfortunately a street cleaner spraying water came along and got the boys good and soaked.. The lady and her friend also present lived together in an apartment and invited the boys up to their apartment to dry their clothes and possibly do some other things? The boys agreed and soon were wearing the girls' bathrobes while their outer clothes were hung to dry. The girls brought out some bottled beer which the boys had trouble with. While the one girl went in the kitchen to prepare some food the other wanted to flirt with Stan who unfortunately wasn't in the mood. Nonetheless he finally came around and eventually knocked her on the floor. Then he said he really didn't like her and that she was too fat. So she chased him around the table until her boxer boyfriend happened by. When he saw what was going on he grabbed a knife and threatened the boys. But quick thinking Stan picked up the pie that the one girl was bringing in from the kitchen and smushed it in the bruiser's face. The boys ran to get their clothes and started to put them on as they climbed out the street windowthis being the first floor. Unfortunately their wives were coming down the street to check out the news report that the theater they were supposed to go to had burned down. When they saw the boys with their pants only half on they hid behind a corner so that the boys didn't see them. They also saw a woman stick her head out the window and tell them to run. Both pairs headed for the Hardy's house the wives getting there first. When the boys showed up the wives had very stern faces like they didn't believe the boys' story. Hardy tried to diffuse their doubts to no avail. The boys were asked to describe what they saw at the theater. They hem and hawed. Stan found a program behind the wives and tried to communicate to Ollie what it said. Ollie put on a makeshift hula skirt to demonstrate. The wives were not impressed. Then Stan showed Ollie the newspaper saying the theater had burned down. Ollie claimed they went to another theater but the wives weren't impressed. Just then one of the girls arrived with Ollie's vest he had left behindHow did she know where to go??. This was the last straw. Ollie's wife exploded and got out their rifle and chased the boys out firing at them.".

'We Slip Up' is not quite as good but is still among their best and funniest early efforts. Their filmography apart from a few bumps along the way was getting better and better and that is obvious here.It may not be new material as such and the first part takes a little bit of time to get going.When 'We Slip Up' does get going which it does do very quickly it is nonstop fun not always hilarious but never less than very amusing. There is insane craziness that doesn't get too silly a wackiness that never loses its energy and the sly wit emerges here some of the material may not be new but how it's executed actually feels fresh and it doesn't get repetitive.Laurel and Hardy are on top form here both are well used both have material worthy of them and they're equal rather than one being funnier than the other before Laurel tended to be funnier and more interesting than Hardy who tended to be underused. Their chemistry feels like a partnership here too before 'Two Tars' you were yearning for more scenes with them together but in 'We Slip Up' we are far from robbed of that.'We Slip Up' looks good visually is full of energy and the direction gets the best out of the stars is at ease with the material and doesn't let it get too busy or static. The supporting players are solid.Overall very good. Not essential or classic Laurel and Hardy but a good representation of them. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Airplane! is was and always shall be the master of spoof movies. It is singlehandedly responsible for literally inventing a subgenre of comedy. It is the ultimate Silly Movie. A satire of the disaster movies of the 1970s particularly the Airport series nothing makes sense and it doesn't need to. There's no real plot. Just laughs  and plenty of 'em.It was helmed by the ZAZ trio Zucker Abrahams and Zucker whose dedication to making the audience laugh is surprisingly adamant. Recent spoofs may have left a bad aftertaste in your mouth but it seems to be a universal agreement Airplane is the funniest film of its genre ever made. Closely followed by The Naked Gun  also penned by the ZAZ trio  perhaps.The plot Ted Striker Robert Hays is a war veteranturnedcabdriver who decides to chase after his girlfriend an airline stewardess named Elaine Julie Hagerty who has dumped him in order to pursue a new life. Right before her plane takes off Ted climbs aboard hitching a ride in order to woo her back into a relationship again.When the aircraft is in midflight both pilots become very ill after eating their meals. Eventually many passengers begin to show symptoms of a rare disease apparently transmitted by the food. Onboard Dr. Rumack Leslie Nielsen takes care of the sick passengers as Ted  an exfighter pilot from the war  decides to try and land the plane. If he messes up they will all die and in a particularly funny scene the pressure becomes so unbearable that he begins to literally sweat gallons in the cockpit.That is essentially all the film is about but most of its duration is spent cracking jokes. Spoof films are entirely different from other movies because normally we would criticize a film if it considered its plot to be the least important element. Not so here. This is a truly brainless piece of celluloid  a movie that doesn't try to be anything that it isn't. From the opening credits  that cleverly spoof JAWS  to the closing we realize that this is an altogether unique film going experience.The movie's biggest laughs come through unexpected flashbacks such as when Ted remembers where he first met Elaine in a crummy bar ...it was worse than Detroit... and begins to discodance a la John Travolta from Saturday Night Fever complete with Bee Gees soundtrack blaring in the background and the famous Travolta pose. Then later we are taken back to when Ted was hospitalized after the war and finds out that he was responsible for the death of six men. Seven actually he is informed which adds to the pain of the moment for him. Though this movie is very funny many jokes misfire. If you're not pop culture savvy and you don't remember Mrs. Cleaver from TV's Leave it to Beaver the humor is going to go over your head. But unlike many comedies Airplane! offers something unique for each person. I know that as a film lover I picked up on many movie injokes that some people might not recognize. And then there were the gags that I first missed but picked up after a second viewing or when someone explained them to me or both. And I'm sure there are many yet that I'm not aware of. It seems that every time I watch it there's something else to laugh at that I missed previously.Airplane! not only was a huge success in 1980 the year of its release spinning off a horde of imitators and one sequel  it was also responsible for crowning Leslie Nielsen The King of Spoof. Prior to Airplane! Nielsen had been a veteran of more serious productions stemming back to playing cowboys on The Mickey Mouse Club and other embarrassing attempts at acting. However Nielsen later claimed that he had always wanted to do a comedy even when he first started acting seriously with projects such as the classic Forbidden Planet one of the best sciencefiction films ever made. He later reunited with the ZAZ trio for The Naked Gun trilogy appeared in similar spoof films over the years such as Wrongfully Accused and Scary Movie 3 and had his iconic comedy shtick ripped off by many screen veterans  most noticeably by George Gaynes in the unbearable Police Academy 1984.When it comes down to a single evaluation Airplane is simply the best spoof film ever made. It's like a MAD Magazine parody come to life. There are the occasional misfires but unlike many other spoof film imitators this one contains far more hits. The deadpan acting is genius and everything else fits into place resulting in what may arguably be one of the absolute funniest films ever conceived and put on the big screen. And if you decide to watch the movie don't blink  you might miss a gag or two. The Police Academies will come and go but Airplane! will never be forgotten.".

	schema:headline " Still hilarious and fresh decades later";
	schema:reviewBody "War pilot Ted Striker boards a flight for the first time since the war in order to stop his relationship with stewardess Elaine breaking up. Unfortunately the fish meal on the flight is bad and causes the crew to go sick leaving the plane on automatic pilot.  With Striker the only man on board who can land the plane can he overcome his fears of failure stemming from the war? This without a doubt one of the best comedies of cinema it is far and away the best spoof ever made  and it was made when this type of humour was still fresh.  From the opening moments right down to the closing credits this is hilarious.  The plot is a straight spoof of 1970's Airport disaster movies and is only an excuse for a range of jokes.  However the plot is bang on  it's detailed enough that it could be a serious disaster movie and allows the film to poke fun directly at the disasters movies themselves. The cast are perfect.  For Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty this represents the best things they've ever done.  Both play the straight men for the majority and are relied upon to take it all seriously and drive the plot while jokes occur all round them that said they deliver many themselves but always straight faced.  Nielsen and Bridges are also spot on as stereotypical doctor and traffic control guy who chose the wrong day to give up drinking!  They are both so straight faced that they make the whole thing seem even more silly. Robert Stack is excellent as the man brought in to talk the plane down playing the butch masculine figure ignoring all the madness around him.  Also on the ground Stephen Stucker is great as the camp controller who delivers many brilliant one liners as he walks through scenes.  Peter Graves and Kareen Abdul Jabbar are great as two of the pilots that almost are in a different movie the things they say! The film is a spot on spoof of disaster movies making fun of the many clichs of the genre  the nuns on board the sick child the only man who can land the plane the poisoned food etc.  But it does more than just poke fun at these  it is hilarious in it's own right.  All the cast deliver their lines brilliantly and the script! The script is excellent  I'm not going to start listing lines but they come so thick and fast that you usually miss something because you're laughing at the last joke.This is the mould for all spoofs  this is the one to beat.  While many spoofs are hit and miss this is almost a total hit.  Decades on and many viewings later this is still as fresh and as funny as it ever was.  A brilliant brilliant comedy!".

	schema:reviewBody "Unfortunately Airplane! has been for me one of those comedies that I have seen so many times in the video store that its appeal has gradually worn down to almost nothing resulting in a total absence of interest in renting it. I eventually watched it one day because I worked at the video store and could rent movies for free and was continuing on my desperate attempt to watch every movie in the store a goal which continues to this day although by now I've come to realize that it's never going to happen. During my quest by the way I also saw the old 1970 film Airport probably ten years after having seen parts of Airplane! and realized that this is one of the many movies that inspired Airplane! In general I'm a little cautious about movies that have exclamation points in the titles but Airplane! is without a doubt one of the funniest movies ever made. Consider for example those little montages that studios sometimes put together and put at the beginning of movies when they come out on videotape honoring the great movies that the studio has made in the past. They show lots of memorable clips from their old movies and I always write all of these titles down determined to watch them all and then promptly lose the list that I made to remind you how great they are. I had a good time watching Airplane! and picking out how many scenes are in the movie that can and do go into those memorable montages.Airplane! is made up of a series of hilarious scenes that string together a thin shoestring plot which ironically speaks in the movie's defense. In general movies with weak stories that are driven along by comedic stunts and pranks and whatnot tend to be pretty weak but Airplane! is not driven by stunts to cover a weak story as much as the quality of the stunts and the slapstick comedy is so good that they overshadow everything else. It's interesting to watch someone like Robert Stack so many years ago and see that he looked and talked exactly like he did in Unsolved Mysteries so many years later a show the seriousness of which boggles the mind given that it's hosted by someone who did so well in a movie like this one.My favorite thing about this movie is obviously the huge amount of sound bytes that comes from it just the cleverness of the way it was written and put together. You have the main character's drinking problem' the airport announcers Listen Betty don't start up with your white zone sht again' the stress of the people investigating the situation on the plane Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit smokingdrinkingamphetamines.' the plays on words There's a problem at the control tower!' What is it?' It's the big tower where the air traffic controllers talk to the planes.' that one airport employee who was suspiciously bubbly and excited throughout the entire movie while providing some of its best comedy and then of course were the situational gags such as Robert Stack pulling off his sunglasses to reveal another pair underneath arguably the most famous scene in the entire film. This is a movie where a list like this could go on and on and I'm sure if you go to the memorable quotes page on the IMDb you'll find a gigantic list of hilarious quotes from the movie there. It is no secret that this is something of a childish and immature comedy but it is smartly written and has so many great scenes and bits of dialogue that it's one of those rare movies that makes you want to take notes so you won't forget a lot of the lines. It is one of the earlier versions of Leslie Nielsen's spoofs a genre in itself which went on to tremendous success with lots of great and some not so great spoofs to follow.".

I've got to concentrate... concentrate... concentrate... Hello?... hello... hello... Echo... echo... echo... Pinch hitting for Pedro Borbon... Manny Mota... Mota... Mota... That pretty much sums up the seriousness of Airplane! the lampoon of the 1970s Airport movies and pretty much every other disaster movie pumped out by Hollywood. The same guys who pieced together the Naked Gun movies write and direct this silly movie. Most of the jokes need to be seen to be properly experienced the first rate actors are what brings the laughs. Robert Stack plays it straight overthetop straight as a problem solver for the airline who happens to wear 2 pairs of sunglasses at all times. Stack's comedic timing and deadpan delivery bring out some of the biggest laughs of the film. Lloyd Bridges is the overworked overstressed traffic controller who has picked the wrong week to stop drinking smoking and sniffing glue. And Leslie Neilson plays a doctor who has an acute sense for the obvious surely one who could save the passengers and airline crew if they land safely just don't call him Shirley. A few cheap laughs a few misses but over all a pretty funny movie. If you like The Naked Gun you'll like Airplane!".

	schema:headline " A hilarious gem!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is voted as one of the funniest comedies of all time and it deserves that honor!  The film is filled with hilarious gags!  Sure in every one of these campy farces there's usually a few gags that are way too silly.  In this case it was the drinking problem gag and that annoying gay man who works on Lloyd Bridges' staff.  But when I can actually count on my hand how many gags didn't work that's a good sign.  The majority of the film sent me into a frenzy of laughter!  One of my favorites is when the blowup autopilot runs out of air and Julie Hagerty blows it back up again.  You'll have to see the movie to find out why it was so hilarious!  I also got a great kick out of the running gag in which every passenger who listens to Robert Hays ends up killing themselves.  This is definitely the Zuckers and Abrahams in top form!  Unfortunately I haven't seen a great spoof in years. The Scary Movie films were pretty good but incredibly lewd and crude. And obviously the Zuckers and Abrahams have much better eyes for satire than the Wayans brothers.  I caught Scary Movie on cable and watched it a second time and I didn't laugh nearly as many times as I did the first time.  I can watch Airplane 200 times and still laugh like there's no tomorrow!  The film was made back when comedies didn't go strictly for sex and toilet gags to make an audience laugh.  This was back when writers used to employ this quality called wit.  Kentucky Fried Movie had some racy gags but even those were witty for the most part.  There is a certain rhythm in every gag that helps make the film work.  For example Lloyd Bridges starts out by saying I think I picked the wrong day to quit smoking.  Then he says he picked the wrong day to quit drinking.  And when he finally says I picked the wrong day to quit amphetamines I was laughing my head off!  So basically you watch a film like this and feel the urge to mail a copy of the video to the Wayans Brothers and whatever crackheads wrote Not Another Teen Movie along with a note saying THIS is how to make a spoof!  There are so many other gags worth mentioning including the Saturday Night Fever sendup which is definitely one of the best comic moments caught on film!  That scene also contains my favorite line  I told the guy next to me to pinch me to make sure I wasn't dreaming.  After that voiceover we see the guy next to Robert Hays repulsed and walking away from him.  Another great example of perfect comic timing and delivery!  If you want to get some authentic belly laughsI'm not talking chuckles but actual LAUGHS!you must check out Airplane.  Trust me movies don't get much more original or funny than this!  My score  9 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Only the writingdirecting team of Jerry and David Zucker and Jim Abrahams could conceive of spoofing a film like ZERO HOUR! while sticking pretty close to its source and garner a smash hit. It's a shame they didn't do more spoofs or that their output has been rather infrequent resulting in each of this team making their own movies with varying degrees of success since there is so much material out there to rip apart from.Here it's the fear of flying. That any flight could encounter problems either from the weather or from machinery is nothing new  it happens plain and simple. That a shot of the flight depicted here as it flies dangerously close to the Chicago skyline probably won't give anyone a 911 jolt nowadays but the undertone is there. There is a fear of planes and this movie takes that specific fear and turns it inside out with hysterical results from the opening shot to the closing credits.Using the premise of ZERO HOUR and the AIRPORT franchise AIRPLANE brings Ted Stryker a man who has a neurotic fear of failure and is a war veteran gets on a plane to get back with his estranged girlfriend Elaine a stewardess on the flight. That he tells his tragic tale to not one but three people all who commit suicide is one of the many laughoutloud sequences but some danger actually ensues when the meals are served and those who have eaten fish fall ill and this includes the pilots. With no one left to fly this plane Ted is called into duty and guided by Captain Kramer whom he hates he has to fly the plane to safety.This is essentially the barebones of the plot. The real stars of the movie are the incessant mile a minute visual referential and verbal jokes that assault the viewer faster than he or she can register. References to classic movies soap operas commercials from the 70s Jim never drinks a second cup of coffee at home... pedophilia basketball voice recordings that guide people through airports outrageous takes on characters from the very movies they are spoofing in short nothing is spared here and it makes for a relentlessly funny movie.That the actors play it straight makes AIRPLANE even funnier. It's as if they weren't sure as to what exactly were they doing and were trying these waters out on a lark luckily for them that it paid because not only it made David Zucker's Jerry Zucker's and Jim Abrahams' career it also brought back Leslie Nielsen into the limelight as a deadpan funny man who could deliver ridiculous lines as if it were the real thing. Its success was so evident that it spawned an inferior remake a slew of similartoned movies many of them directed by the ZuckerZuckerAbrahams team together or separately. This however remains as the spoof movie to watch the one all spoof movie should measure itself to and one of the funniest comedies of all time.".

Airplane! and Naked Gun series are my favorite comedy movies. Of course I'm an Leslie Nielsen fan R.I.P.. These movies are just so much better than nowadays Seth Rogen Jonah Hill and James Franco movies with childish and immature humor.Now someone could remark that Airplane! doesn't have sophisticated humor as well. I disagree. I don't think that humor has to be serious in order to be smart. Airplane! and Naked Gun series create a world filled with absurdities which protagonists seem to take for granted. Those absurdities are sometimes presented very subtly nun reading magazine for nuns but by themselves are not little absurdities. There's much much more to this humor than to smoking pot getting laid cussin' and playing immature and stupid. You don't have to be very bright to enjoy that type of humor. On the other hand you have to be smart and careful if you want to fully enjoy Airplane!. This movies is filled with jokes lines facial expressions etc.  that's why Airplane! is so highly rewatchable. It's unlikely you'll notice everything in first watch.So Jim Abrahams is a genius. He didn't' write a lot but wrote Naked Gun and Airplane!. He also wrote Top Secret! notice the exclamation mark starring Val Kilmer who played Iceman in Top Gun. If you look at Airplane's! cast you'll notice Jim Abrahams playing religious zealot 6. Beautiful Julie Hagerty made this movie extra charming. Kareem AbdulJabbar playing copilot is funny on it's own. Peter Graves R.I.P. was a big gentleman. He started acting back in the 50's! Lloyd Bridges R.I.P. started in 40's. They had big onscreen experience before acting in Airplane!. And that's one more reason why Airplane! is so funny acting is just great. I don't think lesser experienced actors could've done this good job. Leslie Nielsen plays Dr. Rumack. His surprised expression is my favorite one and I believe one of the most famous in the movie history.You can see that cast and whole filmmaking crew had a lot of fun while filming Airplane!. The atmosphere is very relaxing friendly and entertaining. That's why I see this movie every now and then. And so should you  laughing makes you live longer.".

Even Jill Whelan of The Love Boat was able to get in on the act by playing a pediatric patient in need of surgery across the country. This movie took nonstop slapstick to a new level never before traveled to. It made fun of so many films  both disaster and nondisaster flicks  which you needed a scorecard in order to keep track of how many.Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty were simply brilliant in their roles as the starcrossed or should I say star crosseyed lovers who just weren't quite the right fit for one another. Look for cameo appearances by Barbara Billingsley in a role that will surprise you Jimmie Walker CBS'Good Times in the 1970's and for Ethel Merman. I won't tell you where he appears in the film. They will simply crack you up! This is a film that you will want to check out for a week on DVD rental for at least a week in order to catch all the gags and full subtleties and notsosubtleties of the humor involved. After rental you will want to BUY a copy of the DVD to keep.Already honored by the American Film Institute as one of the Top 100 films of all time this truly is a modern American classic! On a scale of 1 to 10 I give this film an 1110. ".

Look for cameo appearances by Barbara Billingsley in a role that will surprise you Jimmie Walker CBS'Good Times in the 1970's and for Ethel Merman. I won't tell you where he appears in the film. They will simply crack you up! This is a film that you will want to check out for a week on DVD rental for at least a week in order to catch all the gags and full subtleties and notsosubtleties of the humor involved. After rental you will want to BUY a copy of the DVD to keep.Already honored by the American Film Institute as one of the Top 100 films of all time this truly is a modern American classic! On a scale of 1 to 10 I give this film an 1110. ";

He never does. But from this film onward he was strictly a comic actor and a good one. Quite a sharp turn for age 55.Just think how tight a line you have to walk with such silliness in order to be brilliant versus inane. What could have easily been the first winner of the Razzie Worst Picture award instead was the first major film of its genre and over the last 30 years has inspired some creative as well as mundane imitators. To understand the film's success you have to look at the time in which it was made  late 70's early 80's. The sarcasm of the postWatergate era in which everything is fair game for ridicule started on TV with Saturday Night Live and first appeared on the big screen with Kentucky Fried Movie but this was the first and best bigbudget attempt at such material.In addition to being the beginning of an era it is sadly the end of one  one in which we all didn't take ourselves quite so seriously. There is no way today that you could make a movie where people are speaking jive as though it were a foreign language or where an Air Israel plane is shown complete with kosher beard. There would be an outcry followed by Congressional hearings. In 1980 there was still a perspective that making fun of certain perceptions and admitting that they are there is a better approach to bringing us all together than just ignoring them and sweeping them under the rug. There's yet another good approach to bringing people together  laughs of which this film is full.Just a word of caution  if you've never seen any of the serious airplane disaster movies that preceded this one such as the Airport movies of the 1970's or the 1950's film High and the Mighty this film will ruin them for you. They all become comedies. Thus you might want to see them before you see Airplane  or if you want to laugh some more see Airplane first.".

Airplane! is a hugely funny movie and has a surprising amount of character depth and back story this often being the highlight of much of the humour. A few flaws with the film could really depend on the viewers style of comedy the slapstick humour can at times go a bit too far and come off as more stupid than funny.

Back in 1980 this was a very funny movie but in 2014 it doesn't hold up quite as well since disco jive talking the glorification of drug use and deadpan comedy aren't exactly in nowadays. A movie like The Jerk still holds up in 2014 because it doesn't rely on the pop culture of its time.That said it's still very watchable and its screen time flies rapidly. You wish more movies had the genius idea of casting serious actors and playing off of their stoic style for laughs. Leslie Nielsen's career took off after playing Dr. Rumack and he had a successful backnine when it came to acting. Julie Hagerty in her debut may come off as somewhat mousy and spacedout as Elaine but she could also be a knockout as seen in the club scene.The movie is worth seeing for those classic exchanges and some funny spoofs but I just feel it doesn't have that punch that it once had after seeing it again recently.".

Not surprisingly the driver's compass ends up not working and they find themselves way off course coming to a stop at a deserted ghosttown that had been a barracks during the fighting in WWII. They find some kerosene useless in terms of refilling the tank of their bus a storage room full of halfpoisoned carrots in tin cans and a native hermit who views them with indifference. The one fellow amongst them who appears to have something on the ball in terms of survivalist techniques goes off to get help. They are to remove the tires from the bus and burn them if he's not back in five days hopefully someone will see the black smoke.Does this sound interesting? Well sure even if it sounds a lot like The Flight of the Phoenix or any number of films in the deserted island genre. Which is why it's surprising that The King Is Alive is Number 4 if anyone is still counting in the ongoing Dogma 95 series which if I remember that ridiculous Dogma 95 Vow of Chastity correctly proclaimed that genre films are strictly verboten. Oops. Well anyway you can tell it's gonna try and be all arty and stuff in order to compensate for the fact that it's a genre flick. Yep it doesn't take long for one member of the group a wizened old stage actor to start scribbling down  from memory!  the various roles from King Lear on well rolls of paper. The idea is that performing the play will help while away the time. All of which really goes against the absconded survivalist's advice to stay optimistic didn't the old actor ever do a dinnertheater performance of The Odd Couple just once in his life? quite apart from such an activity being a colossal waste of precious time and energy.This movie is so bad I really don't know how to continue. It's so monumentally stupid so full of absurd situations and characters that it beggars rational criticism. It may be a timely moment to offer Full Disclosure I despise this socalled Danish film movement to an almost irrational degree. I think my face even turns slightly red at the mere mention of Dogma 95. First of all if the name of your movement has the word dogma in the title you've already lost me secondly in this particular instance the movement's insistence on the abnegation of individual artistic achievement is a recipe for arch hypocrisy when you consider that the filmmakers here are plundering one of the greatest works of the greatest INDIVIDUAL writer who ever lived. But doubtless the Dogma crowd believes the Works of Shakespeare were actually penned by a consortium of Elizabethan bigwigs like the Earl of Oxford Francis Bacon Walter Raleigh and the Queen Herself.Hell I may have forgiven the whole enterprise if it had played the scenario for farcical purposes attacking the precious Dogma  now THAT would be subversive!. But the movie takes itself very seriously and soon devolves into the clichs attendant upon the genre in which it unmistakably belongs people turning against each other the men growing beards the inevitable deaths of a few of the principal actors. All with a straight face. Is this the promised end? Well not quite we also have to endure the abysmal transfer of DV. For this is another Rule in the Dogma 95 Vow of Chastity handheld digital video only. Some friendly advice to the Danes your movement is in trouble when your finished product has worse visual quality than an average highschool graduation home video. Professionalism belongs in an artist's bag of tricks right alongside his own individuality. Artisan and artist are kindred words Mr. von Trier not every jackass with a 100 handheld can be a filmmaker. Pass it on. And by the way allow your Dogma directors to be credited for their films while you're at it. The fact that the writer of The King Is Alive receives credit while the guy or girl actually filming it doesn't is just a wee bit hypocritical. Contemptible. 1 star out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers herein.Woman in the Dunes' meets French Lieutenant's Woman' meets Strangers in Good Company.'Films about film ideas are generally dreary affairs engaging more on an intellectual level than the visceral world that is film's strength. Superficially this film falls into that category with the dogma' bit as a seemingly political statement. In order to support it we have what appears to be an ordinary kind of genre story damaged people stranded in some way with the resulting scrapes and dents. Judged on this grounds this film is a failure the dynamics among the characters just don't engage us by themselves.But a dogma film is supposed to not be a genre film so what gives? Perhaps genres are impossible to avoid. Perhaps this film intends something different to be an exploration of acting and representation on screen. I take it as that. Although the filmmaker insists that the selection of King Lear' is an offhand one I do not believe him. Lear' is all about the eye and whether perceptions can be trusted and what sort of hidden demons lurk on that road between the writer's and viewer's minds.It is the basis of a similar dogma'like experiment in music John and Yoko's Revolution 9' Playing precisely the same role there though not so explicit as here.Hundreds of films in the past couple years deal in some way with the merger of actor and character and the conflating of the experience you see and another you see created the film within. I have a database on these  you'd be surprised how common is the notion. But among these  and going back in time somewhat  one of the most interesting along the dogma lines is Godard's King Lear' a truly amazing film. It is quoted here in a few places.The key point is that the best' theater is close to the chaos of life out of which the viewer can shape his own narrative based on their own demons. My narrative for this film is centered on the man who plays the King here Brion James. He played Leon in Blade Runner' the intellectual of the four targeted bladed replicants. That film is similarly about seemingly selfgenerated impressions. I had it from Dick in the seventies that his story and a couple others was inspired by Lear' and Tempest' precisely because of this untrusted constructed memory thing.In Lear' of course the King dies  and with him we are meant to think  dies the bending of reality that he carried about with him screwing up all that came close. But in the film the King stays alive which I take to be the point we never escape the perturbing lens of film. In real' life of course Brion died right after filming this. In the film he merely suffers delirium and is replaced by the actorwriterdirector of the play. That makes sense.Jennifer Jason Leigh takes on the Cordelia role the one where Godard placed Molly Ringwald! Ms Leigh is among those actresses whose appeal is in her raw commitment. She doesn't work she completely subordinates herself just exactly like the sexual performance' we see here. It's an annoying habit of these young filmmakers to pack irony into every crevice so she plays the one character in Lear that is incapable of just this commitment to artifice. That childish insistence on the part of Levring and so many others drags the whole affair down a couple notches from being worth watching. Oh well.The surrogate for the filmmaker is played by David Bradley who we have recently seen in a role deliberately taken from Lear in the Harry Potter 2 spectacle as the groundskeeper and his magically petrified cat  petrified because of the reflection it saw. Flibbertegibbit!Ted's Evaluation  2 of 4 Has some interesting elements.".

Lear' is all about the eye and whether perceptions can be trusted and what sort of hidden demons lurk on that road between the writer's and viewer's minds.It is the basis of a similar dogma'like experiment in music John and Yoko's Revolution 9' Playing precisely the same role there though not so explicit as here.Hundreds of films in the past couple years deal in some way with the merger of actor and character and the conflating of the experience you see and another you see created the film within. I have a database on these  you'd be surprised how common is the notion. But among these  and going back in time somewhat  one of the most interesting along the dogma lines is Godard's King Lear' a truly amazing film. It is quoted here in a few places.The key point is that the best' theater is close to the chaos of life out of which the viewer can shape his own narrative based on their own demons. My narrative for this film is centered on the man who plays the King here Brion James. He played Leon in Blade Runner' the intellectual of the four targeted bladed replicants. That film is similarly about seemingly selfgenerated impressions. I had it from Dick in the seventies that his story and a couple others was inspired by Lear' and Tempest' precisely because of this untrusted constructed memory thing.In Lear' of course the King dies  and with him we are meant to think  dies the bending of reality that he carried about with him screwing up all that came close. But in the film the King stays alive which I take to be the point we never escape the perturbing lens of film. In real' life of course Brion died right after filming this. In the film he merely suffers delirium and is replaced by the actorwriterdirector of the play. That makes sense.Jennifer Jason Leigh takes on the Cordelia role the one where Godard placed Molly Ringwald! Ms Leigh is among those actresses whose appeal is in her raw commitment. She doesn't work she completely subordinates herself just exactly like the sexual performance' we see here. It's an annoying habit of these young filmmakers to pack irony into every crevice so she plays the one character in Lear that is incapable of just this commitment to artifice. That childish insistence on the part of Levring and so many others drags the whole affair down a couple notches from being worth watching. Oh well.The surrogate for the filmmaker is played by David Bradley who we have recently seen in a role deliberately taken from Lear in the Harry Potter 2 spectacle as the groundskeeper and his magically petrified cat  petrified because of the reflection it saw. Flibbertegibbit!Ted's Evaluation  2 of 4 Has some interesting elements.";

Stranded at a deserted mining camp the group decides to put on a production of King Lear to pass the time. Tempers and passions flair as emotions become raw and exposed in the burning sun.As with all Dogme films this is low tech and in your face. The people and the emotion are the story. These are films that allow actors to show you how good they are. These are also films that can irritate the hell out of you because very often they come across as extremely contrived. This film is an example of both being a really good actors showcase and being contrived.The problem for me with this film is that at the outset I didn't care about anyone. I found the group to be a bunch of high maintenance people who are now in a situation where they can whine some more. The feeling lessened as time went on and things begin to happen but it took awhile. I think part of the problem was that I disliked the set up which seemed far too artificial though certainly it's plausible.I also wasn't that keen on how some of the film was shot. Like all Dogme 95 films its shot using only hand held cameras so the film has an odd feel at times. It mimics as some people have pointed out the look one would get if one had shot the film using a camcorder which lends a sense of being an actual record but at the same time it seems careless and jarring and less than natural despite the fact it strives to be.I liked this film. I didn't love it. I think I would have liked it more if I had come in a few minutes late and could have thought that I missed something. It's a rather bleak film with some people I didn't care for. It's a hard film to warm up to for that reason. If you're interested in an off beat dark drama I'd give this a try though I would suggest you weigh your decision against how you feel about any previous Dogme films you've seen.6 out of 10 your mileage may vary".

Training Day The Fast and the Furious Dark Blue and S.W.A.T. all showcase his passion for writing screenplays about these streets and the role that police officers play in them. His two films as director Harsh Times and Street Kings showed that he could also direct hard hitting dramas depicting the underbelly of the L.A. and the police force. End Of Watch marks Ayer's second film as both writer and director.Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pea star as a two young officers in the Los Angeles Police Department. Using the home footage format of filmmaking End Of Watch shows us the ups and downs of these two young officers as they work love and fight in the streets of Los Angeles.In terms of subject matter this film doesn't cover anything really different. Its about cops dealing with their issues at home and on the job. This topic has been covered countless times but what makes End Of Watch different  and better  then many of its predecessors is that it holds realism as its number one priority. This is one of the most realistic portrayals of police life ever put to celluloid. The day to day lives of these two best friends are shown in a format that is both convincing and horrifying. It doesn't flinch away when showing the disturbing aspects of this high pressure career.Using everyday video sources chest mounted cameras vehicle cameras P.O.V angels aerial shots from police choppers definitely gives the film an unprecedented level of proximity to cops in the line of duty.

	schema:headline " Likable believable characters make this a realistically funny intense and emotionally gripping cop movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "When I actually sit down and think about it there aren't many good movies about your average every day police officer. There are a couple notable television series' like Hill Street Blues and the now dated but oddly fascinating reality series Cops but on film these guys don't get a lot of luck. I guess everyone would rather see movies about undercover officers or detectives. Well for anyone like me who's been waiting for it here it is. End Of Watch an excellent take on the genre. It may not be perfect but it's unique and shows the day to day life more effectively than most if any cop movies I've seen and as such I think it will one day be essential viewing for fans of the genre.In the film we meet Brian Taylor an exmarine working as a police officer while he works his way through law school. He also just so happens to be taking a class in filmmaking and is filming his experiences to make a documentary for said class and this is where we get much of our view into the film from. Featured frequently in the film is his partner Mike often called Z. After stumbling upon a druglord at a routine traffic stop they quickly fall into trouble with the cartel and have to fight their way through it while still trying to figure out where it's all coming from.The great thing about this mockumentaryfound footage style isn't so much the way it's able to present the action of being a cop realistically which it does but so do normally shot movies but it better gives us an understanding of what happens inbetween the action. Being a fly on the wall in the various dull inappropriate and often times hilarious conversations the two have when patrolling brings the film a much needed dose of comic relief but the kind that never feels forced. It's all set up naturally. This really gives a chance for stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena to shine as well as they fit so naturally into these characters often sounding unscripted whether or not they are. They play them as regular guys instead of complex characters which may make them a little less compelling but all the more fun to watch.The film also mixes in a variety of other video sources from the dashboard cams of the police cruisers to security cameras. This really benefits the style as a whole. 99 of the time using the selfshot found footage for an entire film can come off as gimmicky and unnecessary but by using a variety of sources the director is able to keep the realistic tone consistent while downplaying the gimmick idea and instead choosing to use Brian's self shot footage and monologues to the camera only when they prove most effective to the story.Along the way the film is also interspersed with subplots of Brian meeting his new girl Janet played by Anna Kendrick who makes a memorable impression despite her little screen time as well as Z and his wife having a baby. While I find it hard to really complain about Anna Kendrick she's just so damn cute! And she looked stunning on stage introducing the film these subplots while important for character development are thrown in a little too randomly throughout and mess with the overall flow of the film. It's not a huge complaint as I've seen it done worse in other movies but it could've been solved with some tighter editing. But who knows this was the premiere I saw studios still often tweak movies before widerelease.Fortunately for writerdirector David Ayer this is really the only complaint I have about the film. The entire movie is fairly well written. I did find the dialogue of a lot of the street thugs to be clich and racially stereotypical but the things Brian and Z say are priceless throughout and help you deal with a lot of the more serious scenes and there are quite a few of them. For as entertaining and lighthearted as it is at times End Of Watch has many dark brutally violent and emotionally impacting scenes that are not for the feint of heart. They do ultimately seem necessary though as the film needs action to keep it going and to create the realistic document of day to day police life it's trying to create which does get pretty brutal sometimes despite the mostly mundane times in between. The important thing though is that the film is able to balance all of these moments so well.David Ayer has dedicated what seems to be his whole career to police movies. Most are mediocre to bad Street Kings some are genre classics Training Day but I think End Of Watch is by far his finest. It easily has the most likable characters and as such the most emotional involvement for the audience which thus creates the most tension in the high risk action scenes. It has the most believable story of any of his movies or most cop movies for that matter and lastly it just told in an interesting way. Neither the cop story found footage action or fly on the wall comedy genres are anything new but End of Watch takes old ideas and fits them together to make something interesting.In conclusion it's tough to go wrong with End Of Watch if you're a fan of the genre. Even if you're not particularly fond of cop movies I'd still recommend it. It's a highly entertaining tension filled ride of a movie. It may not be as deep as some other movies coming out now but it really brings you into another world well. It's well written well directed well acted and was well enjoyed by the whole crowd. Check it out.".

	schema:headline " Good premise and acting but ultimately bogged down";
	schema:reviewBody "End of Watch is a police drama film written and directed by David Ayer who has worked on a number of policerelated movies in the past as either the writer director or both including S.W.A.T and Street Kings. The film stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena as two LAPD officers and focuses on their daytoday work as police officers and their personal lives. The film does not seem to know what it is in its method of filming. There are numerous times when the scene is shown through a multitude of different cameras but then there are scenes where the angle would be impossible for there to be a camera. A scene I will use as an example is when the gang members are in their car. One gang member has a camera and is filming them which we see the scene unfold through. However when a character talks to them and the camera shows the gang member holding the video camera there are no cameras in the car that would have gotten that video. The point I am making is that the film jumps between foundfootage and then regular filming at random points in scenes which gets frustrating. The dialog in this movie has been praised by many and while I can understand why so many people thought it was great I thought at best it was mediocre. A lot of the street talk was clich and stereotypical as was the banter between the police officers not Gyllenhaal and Pena felt like it came from someone who didn't know how people joked around with one another. This is also one of only three movies the other two being the 2005 Assault on Precinct 13 and the recent movie Sex Tape where I have to complain about the swearing in the dialog. Now I have no problem with swearing but in this movie I felt like it got worked into every other sentence because it was supposed to make the dialog feel more realistic. Now to Ayer's credit there are some scenes with very good use of dialog especially at the funeral scene and the last scene of the movie. The single line used during the funeral said everything that needed to be said without going overboard and the last scene of the movie felt like one person telling a funny story.One thing I will give credit for was the acting in this movie. Gyllenhaal and Pena had very good chemistry and worked off of each other well. Anna Kendrick also did a very good job. I'm actually surprised none of these actors were nominated for Academy Awards for their work in this movie.Even with the acting though the film is still bogged down with problems deriving heavily from the camera work and dialog. The idea of following around two officers in their daytoday lives including their police work and personal lives is an interesting idea and I think it could be pulled off with a better script and less of the found footage aspect of the camera work.".

	onyx:emotionText "End of Watch is a police drama film written and directed by David Ayer who has worked on a number of policerelated movies in the past as either the writer director or both including S.W.A.T and Street Kings. The film stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena as two LAPD officers and focuses on their daytoday work as police officers and their personal lives. The film does not seem to know what it is in its method of filming. There are numerous times when the scene is shown through a multitude of different cameras but then there are scenes where the angle would be impossible for there to be a camera. A scene I will use as an example is when the gang members are in their car. One gang member has a camera and is filming them which we see the scene unfold through.

	schema:headline " Found footage's finest so far  an intense cop thriller that feels real";
	schema:reviewBody "If I were to pitch you a movie about two police officers who are partners on patrol in South Central Los Angeles one of your first inclinations might be not another buddy copy comedy. While End of Watch is often funny the newest film from Training Day writer David Ayer is no comedy.Ayer who spent a lot of time in South Central takes the found footage approach to his latest film featuring the LAPD in the spirit of modern trends and perhaps the show Cops.It's hard to tell if Ayer's exaggerating but a lot of dangerous stuff happens to Taylor Jake Gyllenhaal and Zavala Michael Pena despite being beat cops. So much so that they get involved with the wrong Mexican gang and their attempts to go above and beyond to protect and serve put them in the line of fire.Gyllenhaal and Pena have incredible chemistry as two cops who are best friends as well as partners. They epitomize the modern bromance in a number of ways joking around giving each other a hard time offering lovedating advice with hypermasculine sarcasm etc. Ayer takes time to show these men out of their blues frequently to humanize them in a critical way. On the job they are often cocky proud and reckless pushing the line of appropriate police behavior and protocol. They jump back and forth between making laudable responsible choices and borderline police brutality.The portrait that this paints of law enforcement feels so much more authentic than we're normally treated to in cop films and police procedurals on television. They are heroes and good honorable men but that doesn't make them beacons of morality. No matter how much you believe in the quickly escalating plot of End of Watch there's no disagreement to be had over the authenticity of the characters and the environment they operate in. Although we do get independent episodes in which Taylor and Zavala respond to calls and find more than they bargained for there's a throughline involving a powerful Mexican drug cartel and the gang that enforces it. Ayer glamorizes these thugs a little bit but it makes them formidable villains in the story. As things come to a boil the realism of the film really unravels in favor of a more compelling heartpounding finale.Ayer takes certain liberties with the found footage style as well. The premise involves Taylor filming everything for a school project or something. He has a handheld camera but also cameras positioned in the squad car and ones that clip onto their uniforms. The gangs also carry cameras around to film their violent escapades. At times however we can't tell who is supposed to be holding the camera  like when Taylor starts making out with his girlfriend Janet Anna Kendrick. Neither is holding the camera so that's a bit strange.Still that filmmaking style does more good than harm to the film. Say what you will about the found footage trend but this is an appropriate example that really works. The extra layer of realism and authenticity that the technique gives to a film really goes miles in favor of End of Watch. Humor is an unexpected benefit of this film as well. Michael Pena has failed to be funny in films including Tower Heist and 30 Minutes or Less but he succeeds in territory that blends it with the dramatic in this very organic way. It would be impressive if most of the dialogue in this film at least between him and Gyllenhaal weren't improvised given how natural it flows. It sounds like a stretch to consider this one of the better acted films of the year but Gyllenhaal and Pena should've been considered for awards contention. The nature of found footage detracts from what we tend to associate withlook for in an Oscarworthy performance. We expect authenticity from found footage and only comment when it goes poorly not when it's done exceptionally well. Having seen enough films made in the found footage style no other two actors have done better in this genre.End of Watch offers an intense look at the life of L.A.'s finest and a harrowing portrait of life in the barrios and gangridden parts of L.A. Although exaggerated at crucial points it shows what can happen when officers try and step out of their clearance level. At the least it's one of the best films found footage has given us to date.Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more".

It feels like the guys know each other their whole life. Their interactions with social media and real life feel ... well real. Nothing in this movie feels like it is staged for entertainment purposes nor does the dialogue sound fake.I did write drama but there is also quite a bit of action in this one. The handheld approach to some of the scenes does not take anything away from them it actually heightens the experience most of the time. Of course as an Anna Kendrick fan I would've loved to see more of her in the movie but it does belong to our two heroes and what they are going through.

	schema:reviewBody "End of Watch seems to be another film that uses the foundfootage style but once again it's not a successful try. However it still gets what it wants by being a true to life buddy cop film with a ridiculous amount of intensity. End of Watch looks pretty simple as a crime thriller but everything is actually brilliant. The crimes are grim and the action is a load of thrills. But what really makes this film so appealing is the chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pea. Their bromantic moments keeps the entire film so charming. The rest of End of Watch is engaging and interestingly gripping.The story is about the lives of the lead pair. As these police officers patrol around the streets they spend their time talking and joking around until they see something going on. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pea brings it to life. Their chemistry is the magic of this film. When it gets serious it becomes really intense makes you wish both of them are safe on their dangerous jobs. The common elements of cop movies are explosions and stylish gunfights but this film is all about tension and momentum.The foundfootage style is as messy as what the recent foundfootage film Chronicle did. Which falls into being unnecessary. It sometimes gets shots that aren't filmed on any handheld cameras. The camerawork is still well shot and serves a different experience but it could have been something like what action directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylorstrangely has the same name of the main character do. Shaking the camera ridiculously without calling it a foundfootage film. If you ignore the style it would be cool. The quality of the film is being realistic and there it succeeds. They left the impossibly cool police movie stuff behind and instead make them simply scrutinize arrest and watch the streets.End of Watch doesn't have much of a concept but to depict the credible lives of these hero cops. While the lead stars shine on their beautiful downtoearth bromance there's a grim reality about to affect their lives thus makes this an indeed so compelling film. Still it could have been a Crank like film than a foundfootage. The crazy cam is a great effect but not the characters holding the camera. Aside from that it's a top notch thriller that is easy enough to enjoy. Worth a ride and recommended.".

While I accepted the story line of tough inner city cops working tough neighborhoods I found the use of handheld cameras to show uncommon angles to be an unnecessary distraction. So was the constant referencing of Anna Kendrick's cleavage in almost every shot she was in.But the biggest letdown in this movie was the generic nature of the battle between law enforcement and the human traffickers they fought against. The coyote types were one dimensional characters only  cold and angry all the time. We never really are told why they hate the police so much other than that the police are obstacles to their business. But the human element was missing.The other letdown was the portrayal of the disconnect between the LAPD a local agency and Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE a federal agency. We aren't given enough content about their lack of information sharing and the plot too easily glosses over ICE's not sharing potentially life saving information with the LAPD.The one bright spot in the movie was the acting by Jake Gyllenhaal. He was very convincing as a hard charging bendtherules street cop. But this movie could have been so much more end evoked more empathy from its audience had the script been better refined.".

We never really are told why they hate the police so much other than that the police are obstacles to their business. But the human element was missing.The other letdown was the portrayal of the disconnect between the LAPD a local agency and Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE a federal agency. We aren't given enough content about their lack of information sharing and the plot too easily glosses over ICE's not sharing potentially life saving information with the LAPD.The one bright spot in the movie was the acting by Jake Gyllenhaal. He was very convincing as a hard charging bendtherules street cop. But this movie could have been so much more end evoked more empathy from its audience had the script been better refined.";

	schema:reviewBody "I intend to write reviews of movies where my opinion goes against the majority opinion. Unfortunately I usually see movies either in 2nd run theaters or on TV which is okay if the movies are over a year old or classic films but is generally too late to matter when it is new movies. But I'm putting my two cents in on this film.This flick received generally good reviews from both the public and critics. I'm not sure I was watching the same movie as everyone else. First the handheld camera gambit was annoying. I know that the thought was for it to add an artistic element but it was just plain perturbing. It reminded me of my father taking home movies back in the day. A lot of the action scenes were just fastmoving indiscernible images as though the camera were being flipped and spun around like a football. If not for the audio I would not have had a clue as to what was going on. Also everything was too dark meaning that there was a need for more daylight scenes. And it looked like scenes were spliced together ad hoc. Maybe that was part of the alleged artistry attempt in the movie.Some of the scenes of the evil Mexican gang were almost funny in their absurdity. There was one scene where the Mexican outlaws were riding in a van and shouting angry obscenitylaced threats at each other in a thick Hispanic accent. I leaned over and asked my coviewer sitting next to me what they were yelling about and she shrugged her shoulders and then whispered to me that she thought they were debating the scientific possibilities of intergalactic travel. It was the high point of the movie.I'm not sure how anyone could care about the two main characters. Any attempt they made to show some personal depth and heartfelt emotion came off as either false or aggravatingly macho. Just not good. When everyone good guys and bad guys alike were apparently killed in one scene near the end I felt a relief that the bewildering andor poorly drawn characters were gone and I would soon be in my car going home.I have seen a lot of movies in my day and this one may not be the worst but it is probably in the bottom 20.".

	schema:reviewBody "www.TheMovieFrog.com End of Watch Writerdirector David Ayer was only really familiar to me before I saw this film for writing the script to Training Day. That and positive buzz from the festival circuit gave me some measure of hope that I was really going to enjoy End of Watch but it just didn't quite do it for me. Unfortunately both of the big problems land squarely in Mr. Ayer's lap.Can fake found footage film making be finally finished? I for one have had it. It was revolutionary in The Blaire Witch project. Today...blase blase blase. This movie actually takes it to a whole new level where the cops are making videos while on the beat and the crooks are making videos as they commit the crimes. If they'd put down their own cameras for a second they could probably watch their opponents' every move on YouTube. This gimmick I won't even call it a directorial flourish plays about as ludicrously as I've made it sound. Again I ask Since the found footage snake is obviously eating its own tale can we just stand back and let it finish its meal? Thank you.So besides coming off like Cops meets Lethal Weapon live tweeted the other problem is with the script. End of Watch is SUCH a stereotypical buddy cop movie. I spent almost the entire run time going Oh that's just like in  only shot on much lower quality film. The screenplay's only saving grace lies in the dialogue between the two main characters as they ride around in their squad car. Fragments of that are actually quite witty.Which leads to the real bright point of the film Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena's performances. They have great on screen chemistry and their interaction is THE reason to check out this picture once. This should be a real breakout role for Pena who actually manages to upstage his far more famous costar. Together they are able to overcome the predictability of the movie and make it enjoyable for scant moments...but only moments...3 of 5 stars.additional movie reviews and more can be found at httpfb.me1RYJhMyPN".

	schema:reviewBody "I was really excited to see this in theatres I thought the trailer looked good but I have to admit what really sold it to me was that it was from the writer from Training Day. I'm not big into foundfootage movies there's been so many of them the gimmick doesn't feel fresh anymore. Even though it wasn't playing anywhere near me I made the trip with my best friend and we both walked out of the movie with our jaws hitting the floor. It's easily the best found footage movie that I've ever seen and it's also easily the best work of it's writerdirector David Ayer.Minor Spoilers Ahead The movie begins with a police chase being recorded from a dashboard camera. Officer Brian Taylor Jake Gyllenhaal is delivering a monologue about how he's required to take these criminals down. It doesn't matter if he agrees with the law it's his job to put these guys in a cage. He's chasing these guys with his partner officer Mike Zavala Michael Pena and after he's finally run them off the road there's a shootout. They are able to put these guys down and the tape ends with them waiting for backup.We then join them again at the precinct in the locker room. Brian introduces himself as an officer of the LAPD. He shows them his locker the equipment he's carrying on a daily basis and even briefly introduces his partner Mike and another officer Van Hauser David Harbour. Van Hauser isn't too keen on Taylor taping everything and tells him he's going to report him. Taylor and Zavala laugh it off and head out. Next we see them with the other officers in their division. Their Sargent Frank Grillo is assigning them to certain districts in their city and their superior Captain Reese shows up. Reese tells the rest of the unit that Taylor and Zavala were cleared in the shooting of the previous police chase. He doles out the assignments and they head out to try and make a difference.I stated in the opening that foundfootage is a gimmick it's no longer new and exciting and frankly I'm getting tired of it. I bring that up again because for a foundfootage movie End of Watch is really well shot. There are some scenes where there are very cool camera angles the action scenes are coherent something that foundfootage movies just can't seem to get and exciting. People have complained that there are bits where its not completely clear who's holding the camera and I won't disagree. But I think the fact that the movie is so well filmed helps you gloss over that and I've never had a problem when watching it.End of Watch has a plot arc but most of the movie feels like what its pretending to be a sampling of a few days in the lives of these guys. Again I found this to be more effective than your standard plot line. The stuff these guys have to deal with is crazy and while I'm sure most of the cops in L.A. don't have to deal with all of this on a daily basis I could see a lot of this going down. It keeps the movie moving at a quick pace and you don't know what's going to happen next.In my opinion what makes this movie special is the interplay between the characters. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena are great together and by themselves. You completely buy them as best friends and people who would be hanging out together day in and day out. They're actually really funny in the scenes that they are just driving around and considering how dark this movie gets its some much needed levity. A lot of the supporting characters do a good job too. Natalie Martinez Anna Kendrick David Harbour America Ferrera and Frank Grillo are all fun to watch in their respective roles. Some people complain about the gang villains and I would agree that their acting isn't terribly strong. I don't have a problem with that though the movie is about Taylor and Zavala's friendship not about them taking on the cartel.I've watched this movie more than a few times and I love it each time I watch it. The movie moves quickly there's a lot of great acting a believable feel to it and it gives you main characters that you want to root for. I'm so glad I took the time to search it out when it was in theatres and although it didn't get the awards attention that they probably wanted it does have quite the following. It's easily one of my favourite movies definitely one of the best in the past few years. It shows the talent that David Ayer has and even though not every movie he's made has been excellent Sabotage was disappointing he's very good at what he does and I hope he gets more good projects going forward.".

	schema:headline " Pathetic at best";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie was one of the most mangled pieces of garbage I think I have  ever seen. I actually almost wish that I was speaking in hyperbole. I  was so insanely bored by found footage of some loser cop's college  class project that I would rather have watched a documentary on the  history of drinking straws. The movie is basically about two cops that  do nothing but goof around break protocol and act like the lowlifes  that they are trying to uproot. Not only is half of the movie  unrealistic such as ignoring a government agent's orders to leave the  gang that they are dealing with alone buts it is saturated with  stereotypes that are hyperbolas themselves. The gangsters in this  film talk like they are actors in a porno. Almost every line of  dialogue that they utter is laced with fbombs. Don't get me wrong  cussing happens a lot in many people's lives and occupations but to  the point where literally every other word is fk is annoying. There  is a particular seen where some of the gangbangers are talking about  killing the cops and it sounds somewhat like this Dude F we are  fing gonna f these fers up fing forever fing even fing if we have  to fing f those fers 'til they're fed so much that fing their fing  mom will be fing skull fing them to fing bring their fing f's back  to fing life. F bro. I'm fing serious. F. F. F I Fing love you. And  this kind of dialogue happens at least three times for what seems like  10 minutes each scene. The fact that the gangsters are filming  themselves is one of the dumbest things because most of the recordings  are of them talking about committing crimes and killing the cops. I'd  love to see the court case after the fact where 300 hours of  incriminating footage had been recovered as evidence to put these  idiots down. That might almost make a better movie than this one. Then  there is the other stuff that all the other bad reviews have mentioned.  The acting is terrible. And no I do not believe that Gyllenhal and Pena  saved this movie. It is the worst film that either of them has been in.  Also many of the reviewers are right these cops would have died  horrible deaths with as many bullets that were supposedly being shot at  them. The fact that cops would be portrayed like this even though I  hate cops it is disrespectful to all who serve for the police forces  in America. I can't even think of any redeeming qualities for this  film. If I could I would give it a zero. The only part of the film  where I may have smiled in joy is when one of these loser cops kicks  the bucket but then they ruin the movie again by letting his partner  live and sob into his chest. I'm actually surprised he didn't kiss him  goodbye. My movie theatre has a no refund policy and therefore I sat  and kept praying the movie would somehow get better or at least just  end. It is really sad that stuff like this can get released in  theatres get good reviews and steal my money all in one day. I've  practically stopped seeing movies for the first two weeks because  that's how long you usually have to wait for the honest reviews to  emerge.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie was one of the most mangled pieces of garbage I think I have  ever seen. I actually almost wish that I was speaking in hyperbole. I  was so insanely bored by found footage of some loser cop's college  class project that I would rather have watched a documentary on the  history of drinking straws. The movie is basically about two cops that  do nothing but goof around break protocol and act like the lowlifes  that they are trying to uproot. Not only is half of the movie  unrealistic such as ignoring a government agent's orders to leave the  gang that they are dealing with alone buts it is saturated with  stereotypes that are hyperbolas themselves. The gangsters in this  film talk like they are actors in a porno. Almost every line of  dialogue that they utter is laced with fbombs. Don't get me wrong  cussing happens a lot in many people's lives and occupations but to  the point where literally every other word is fk is annoying. There  is a particular seen where some of the gangbangers are talking about  killing the cops and it sounds somewhat like this Dude F we are  fing gonna f these fers up fing forever fing even fing if we have  to fing f those fers 'til they're fed so much that fing their fing  mom will be fing skull fing them to fing bring their fing f's back  to fing life. F bro. I'm fing serious. F. F. F I Fing love you. And  this kind of dialogue happens at least three times for what seems like  10 minutes each scene. The fact that the gangsters are filming  themselves is one of the dumbest things because most of the recordings  are of them talking about committing crimes and killing the cops. I'd  love to see the court case after the fact where 300 hours of  incriminating footage had been recovered as evidence to put these  idiots down. That might almost make a better movie than this one. Then  there is the other stuff that all the other bad reviews have mentioned.  The acting is terrible. And no I do not believe that Gyllenhal and Pena  saved this movie.

The main Actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pea did a really good job with what they had to work with but the rest of the cast dropped the ball so hard that there was no way the main actors could carry them. Just listen to the bad guys dialog. Every other word is an Fbomb. They were trying so hard to look bad ass especially the female actor but it was in no way convincing. In fact it was very much laughable. If you don't mind bad acting shaky cams and horrible storylines then give this movie ago.

And Pena actually managed to steal the show from his costar. I liked him a lot. 2. There's some genuinely gripping material here with the opening car chase the home entries and the shootouts. Kudos to Ayer for making amateur home movie footage riveting.What bothers me about End of Watch is that it's a movie written around the novelty of found footage. So much effort was put into capturing the warzone streets from every conceivable angle that Ayer forgot to throw in a decent story. It's sold as a realistic tale of the brotherhood of two LAPD officers brothers in arms but it's not really about that. This movie is ultimately about two cowboy cops who run afoul of some evil drug lords and they get shot up as a result. Roll credits. I have no idea what Ayer was trying to say with this movie because the sleightofhand he pulls at the end leaves me with a completely empty feeling. If he'd at least killed both men not the one who didn't deserve it we could acknowledge the nihilistic bent. But we're supposed to feel something for Gyllenhaal's unlikable character because he messed up. How was this at all about brotherhood?This would've been better if it was just about the cops' lives on the streets and their struggle to maintain humanity at shift's end. Just leave out the Mexican cartel and their ridiculously cartoonish assassins. The narration Gyllenhaal gives during the opening car chase promises a far more interesting cop movie than what's presented here.

	schema:reviewBody "From conflicts of duty and heart like Brooklyn's Finest to police morality tales such as the nowinfamous Training Day over to classics like Serpico no film to chronicle the daytoday lives and misadventures of our men and women in blue has come off quite as authentic as End of Watch. Writerdirector David Ayer who is no stranger to the genre with titles Street Kings S.W.A.T. and the aforementioned Denzel Washington thriller to his name has honed in on everything that made his previous efforts a success while stripping away most of those elements that have now become clich. That is not to say that End of Watch shatters new ground or that the strippeddown procedural format hasn't been done in equally effective fashion often more potently in television series such as Southland and The Wire but it would be grossly unfair to not give glowing credit where it is due. Thanks to the grippingly genuine performances from leads Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena End of Watch is one of the best films of the year and absolutely one of the best of its kind across all possible subgenres. Dirty cop undercover gangster  you name it. At an aesthetic level the use of upcloseandpersonal shaky cam easily distinguishes Ayer's tale from other beatcop chronicles while somewhat inviting comparisons to the aforementioned Southland at the same time. It makes End of Watch feel much closer to the reality show Cops then to the likes of Narc or Cop Land. Likely not to make people as nauseated as other found footage fare End of Watch only calls into attention its gimmick when addressing the fact that the cameras are there e.g. turn that camera off I'm doing this for a film class etc. Simply employing the closeup feel and nothing more would have done End of Watch a number of favors. Bolstering the positive elements of that filmmaking choice even further is the grippingly faithful dialogue which while not shying away from the codeladen jargon that accompanies the job also provides impeccably easygoing and often hilarious exchanges that would make the likes of Aaron Sorkin or Quentin Tarantino proud. It is in this screen writing sense where Ayer has triumphed over his previous outings. Gyllenhaal and Pena aid in bringing the script to life and have such an easygoing rapport it is impossible not to be caught up with these two brothers in arms. Truthfully it's all awardsworthy stuff. The plot is pretty cut and dry but for End of Watch it stands as one of the film's greatest strengths. Spanning the course of about a year officers Taylor and Zavala respond to domestic disputes house fires and suspicious individuals. As they say not everything is car chases and gunfights. Although they often think of themselves as cowboys and South Central L.A. could be mistaken for the Wild West on more than one occasion End of Watch isn't afraid to explore the family lives of these characters the down times and the casual anecdotal exchanges that go along with the shoot'emup side of law. With his shaved head and confident swagger Gyllenhaal slips effortlessly into his role as the young hotshot rising to the occasion of the demanding offhanded dialogue and without a doubt provides one of the best and most authentic performances of his already noteworthy career. Shattering all preconceived notions at what he was capable of Pena is essentially a revelation proving tough funny and caring in equal measure often at the same time. He seems to glean more charisma off of Gyllenhaal than other thesps with whom he's shared the screen. Supporting characters Anna Kendrick as the love interest of Taylor Natalie Martinez charming and feisty as Zavala's wife and all of the despicable street thugs who share the screen with our protagonists are also stellar making for nothing close to a weak link. Gripping tragic and utterly unafraid to go to gruesome places End of Watch is a hugely pleasant surprise for a genre which has become all about the duality of crooked cops and surprise twist reveals that pluck an undercover cop out of thin air at the most opportune moment. There is something refreshing about having a film examine a clearcut line of good and evil all while maintaining the ability to keep your sweaty hand firmly clasping the other.8.510playeraffinity.com".

	schema:reviewBody "End of Watch was OK. Entertaining enough but I would say just wait for DVDblu ray. It's supposed to be one of those Blair witch or cloverfield type movies where as the viewer you are supposed to be watching found footage. In the beginning the movie establishes that Jake Gyllenhaull has a handheld camcorder while also having along with his partner a minicam pinned to their uniforms. My main gripe however is that there are camera shots interspersed throughout the film that are not from any camera point of view. This breaks the rule of found footage movies. For instance Jake is recording his partner kick open a locked door from the front of an empty house. All of a sudden though we cut to a shot from inside the house just to see his partner bust open the door and them coming through with guns drawn. Yet no one is in the house so who's camera are we looking through? Then we are suddenly back looking through Jake's camcorder. It just didn't make sense and it happens a little too often. It's like the director wanted to include certain shots but couldn't think of how to include them so he just threw them in there and just hoped no one noticed. SloppyDirectingDarrylBrian".

For instance Jake is recording his partner kick open a locked door from the front of an empty house. All of a sudden though we cut to a shot from inside the house just to see his partner bust open the door and them coming through with guns drawn. Yet no one is in the house so who's camera are we looking through? Then we are suddenly back looking through Jake's camcorder. It just didn't make sense and it happens a little too often. It's like the director wanted to include certain shots but couldn't think of how to include them so he just threw them in there and just hoped no one noticed. SloppyDirectingDarrylBrian";

	schema:reviewBody "In Britain The Night Digger is shown from time to time on TCM normally late at night under the alternative title The Road Builder. It is not however a particularly wellknown film even though the script is by one of Britain's bestknown writers Roald Dahl and it stars an Oscarwinning actress Dahl's wife Patricia Neal.Neal plays Maura Prince a middleaged spinster living in the English town of Windsor with her mother Edith. Several years earlier Maura suffered a serious stroke which left her temporarily paralysed although she has now recovered and works as a therapist helping other stroke victims. Dahl inserted this as an obvious reference to the fact that Neal had herself suffered such a stroke in 1965. Maura is finding it difficult to cope with the demands of looking after her elderly mother and maintaining their large Victorian Gothic house obviously once luxurious but now run down and dilapidated.Their lives are changed when they hire a young man named Billy as a handyman. Billy is a roadbuilder working on a new motorway which is being built in the area. The motorway runs from Liverpool to London via Manchester Birmingham Oxford Reading and Windsor. In reality no single motorway has ever been built along this route although the southern part of the route corresponds roughly to the M40 which did not exist in 1971 not being completed until 1988.Billy claims that his surname is Jarvis and that he is originally from Cheshire in northwest England which causes Edith to claim him as a longlost relative as she has family with that surname in that county. Billy's accent however is a southeastern one which must cast some doubt on his claim he may have discovered Edith's family background and invented a story to deceive her. At first he seems to be a godsend to Edith and Maura he is polite friendly helpful and a competent worker whose efforts soon have the dilapidated house and overgrown garden looking smarter. Billy however may be hiding a dreadful secret. A young woman from the area is found murdered and the police attribute the crime to a serial killer who has taken the lives of several other women in different parts of the country. Ominously the other killings took place in Liverpool Manchester Birmingham Oxford and Reading the cities close to which Billy was previously working on the new motorway. There is however a further complication in that Maura previously a dutiful daughter obedient to every whim of her domineering mother finds herself becoming attracted to the handsome young man.The plot is not always satisfactory and the ending after Maura and Billy have run away to the Scottish Highlands together is particularly enigmatic. This is surprising given that Dahl was a gifted short story writer whose stories normally ended with a satisfying twist. Although it is clear to the audience that Billy is indeed a killer and there is an attempt to explain psychologically why he became one we are never sure how much Maura knows or suspects about his guilt. Is she convinced of his innocence or is she closing her eyes to the obvious. Or does she know all along that he is guilty? Our view of Maura depends very much upon the answers to these questions so it is surprising that they are never definitely answered. Perhaps Dahl felt it made for a more satisfactory film to keep us guessing. The title The Night Digger refers to Billy's habit of disposing of his victims at night by burying them under the motorway workings. The plot has many similarities to that of another British film from a few years earlier Night Must Fall which also regularly appears on TCM and which also features a mother and daughter living together and a psychopathic handyman. Night Must Fall a remake of a 1937 American film with the same title which I have never seen is a rather dull film with one of Albert Finney's weakest performances at its centre. The Night Digger although it has its weaknesses is an altogether better film.Rather surprisingly for a winner of the Best Actress award Neal never really became a household name certainly not when compared to other Best Actress winners from the sixties such as Elizabeth Taylor Sophia Loren and Katharine Hepburn. Her performance here however shows just how good she can be as the sexually repressed spinster dominated and emotionally manipulated by her mother. Although we may suspect that she is knowingly covering up for a murderer we always retain some sympathy for her. Pamela Brown is also good as the terrifying Edith even though she was really too young for the role being only nine years older than Neal.Besides the acting The Night Digger is also notable for its brooding mysterious feel. Even without the macabre nature of the story the photography of the damp autumnal English countryside and the decaying Gothic mansion aided by the score from Hitchcock's favourite composer Bernard Herrman would be enough to conjure up a sense of nameless dread. Director Alastair Reid was no Hitchcock he worked mainly in television and only made a few feature films but he brings a few atmospheric touches to this film. His use of unusual oblique camera angles and his technique of concentrating on only a part of a speaker's face normally the eyes or mouth add to the general strange and unsettling atmosphere of this film. Despite the obscurity into which it has fallen The Night Digger is a tense thriller and characterstudy which it is worth staying up late to see. 610".

I caught this on late night TV about 20 years ago and have never forgotten it.It was about a young man named Billy Nicholas Clay helping out Maura Prince Patricia Neal and her elderly mother Pamela Brown in their crumbling old house in England. Neal starts to fall for him despite their age difference...but she's not aware of what he does when he goes out alone every night...Spooky little horror film. When I first saw it it was edited for TV so there were some unexplained pieces like a bit about something that happened to him as a child which explains what he does as an adult and I assumed the violence was gone. I was finally able to see the entire uncut film and loved it! It wasn't a blood and guts horror movieit's an excellent psychological horror. In fact the two violent acts in it aren't even shown! It concentrates on Billy and Maura and their feelings and thoughts. Clay and Neal are such great actors that just their expressions tell you what they're feeling. The growing romance between them was touching and believable. Also there's an excellent score and the ending was a stunner! This film has an R rating for some dialogue and a lengthy nude sequence with Clay. Well worth catching just for Clay and Neal.This movie is available on DVD through the made to order system with the Warner Brothers Archive Collection. It's complete and the transfer is pristine. Well worth getting. It might disturb you but you'll never forget it. Avoid the cut version on TCM.".

Patricia Niel was perfect as the spinster who was stuck caring for her blind and horrid adoptive mother and who slowly but surely becomes sexually aware of the young drifter played by Nicholas Clay.

The film is based on a book by Joy Cowley although there were apparently some changes made to the story I don't know what since I've not read the book. One of the more surprising things about this film is the fact that the screenplay was written by popular children's author Roald Dahl although clearly he did also have a taste for the macabre if Tales of the Unexpected as well as his children's book 'The Witches' are anything to go by. The film is a strange love story at heart and we focus on a house inhabited by an old spinster and her middle aged daughter Maura. Their lives are changed one day when a young stranger on a motorbike turns up and they agree to let him stay. The young man becomes a popular figure in the house rather quickly especially with Maura. However there's something strange about him as evidenced by his sudden bursts of depression apparently owing to the tragic death of his parents.Most of the plot takes place in a grandiose mansion and it makes for a really good location for the movie  it's very isolated and is nice to look at. The atmosphere is very good throughout and this excellently compliments the plot which is thoroughly dark and largely unpleasant. The plot doesn't move particularly quickly but it's always interesting thanks to the way that the characters are built up progressively and director Alastair Reid focuses on their relationship with one another. The acting is very good and the film stars Roald Dahl's then wife Patricia Neal in the lead role. She gets on well with the other two main players Pamela Brown and Nicholas Clay and these actors help to ensure that the film works well. There's not a great deal of shocking moments but the way that the unpleasant happenings are handled works very well as it's nasty yet completely believable. It all boils down to a very good ending and The Road Builder is certainly a film with a 'sting in the tail'. Overall I really hope this gets a decent release soon because it's a great thriller and well worth seeing!".

	schema:reviewBody "Small spoilers....I saw this movie under the title  the Road Builder. Only that title alone sounded interesting to me. I got especially interested when I learned that the screenplay was written by Roald Dahl. We all know that he wrote some remarkable stories but most his most memorable work in the field of children's literature. The screenplay of The Road Builder isn't really meant for a young audience...It's a dark story and really creepy from time to time. It's very psychological and therefore difficult to follow at certain moments. I saw this gothic suspense thriller on TCM but without any subtitles. So the dialogues were hard to follow sometimes. Especially with a rather complicated story. It's about a spinster Maura who lives with her blind mother is a large house. Their lives change when a young handyman  named Billy  comes to live with them. Billy is charming and really helpful around the house but he hides some terrifying secrets. It seemed that Billy faced some trauma's in his childhood years and he still hasn't put them behind him. Thus some nights ... Billy goes out on his motorcycle to do horrible things. The developing of the story is really fascinating and also the terrific acting performances keep you close to the screen. Patricia Neal  who was married with Roald Dahl for forty years and gave him 5 children  is really outstanding in her role of shy and quiet middleaged woman. Also the young Nicolas Clay impresses as Billy. Clay died in 2000 after a long disease.The Road Builder certainly is worth a watch when you're in the mood for seeing a scary psychological thriller or a deep character study. Just make sure there aren't too many aspects to distract you. You'll need full attention to enjoy this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen this film last week on TV. I am glad that the there are English subtitles so that I can clearly enjoy the dialogue. Only it is pity that the English subtitles from TCM are kind of closed captions that cannot be taken for recording.Different than the comment of another Dutch viewer from 2006 I find this film a rather nice good movie. The maker has put quite some different thrilling creeping emotional romantic components to the movie but not into deep touch by purpose. If one is specially looking for or fond of a particular type of movie from one of these components one may not feel satisfied enough. However I am glad that the maker had made it in this way that the movie content becomes rich in a special way. It makes the film as a whole quiet thrilling creeping emotional and even bit romantic too. It is not boring at all I enjoy every moment of the movie. Making a film to a particular typedirection of course is a heavy job but to combine different type of components in a fine way is not easy too.The film is quite moving that I have only realized at the end that it is already a film of 110 minutes. It is not boring at all I have enjoyed every moment of the movie. Yes this is not a film made for award nomination but both the director and the leading actors have done a pretty good job. If you watch the film carefully you will realize that the film is quite fine made. From their fine work you can see and feel the style of the early 70's British films. It is a small budget production but still leaves some compelling moonshine. I simply like this movie.The ending indeed is quite a critical way. I have never read the novel. I don't know whether the end is the same as the movie. I wonder if the director has extended and refined the ending for about 10 minutes more will the ending be then a bit better than a shortcut? On the other hand I have the feeling that it seems that the director has deliberately made the ending in this stunning way that it now leaves us crossing feelings and questions that makes the movie still time to time staying on our mind.It may not be a top Afilm but it is a little gem which absolutely is worthing to see.I give it 7.75 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "As others have said this movie was written by British poetauthor Roald Dahl as a vehicle for his wife American actress Patricia Neal. I thought of it recently after seeing a similar American movie Happy Mother's Day Love George that featured Neal and the couple's reallife daughter Tess Dahl. The basic story is pretty good. Neal plays a lonely spinster whose domineering mother rents a room to a traveling road worker Nicholas Clay and Neal's character finds herself drawn to the handsome younger man unaware that he might be a serial killer who has buried a string of female victims along the road he is building. . .This definitely works as a vehicle for Neal who is probably most famous for the Paul Newman movie Hud even though her character in that was supposed to have been AfricanAmerican but such a thing would have simply been too incendiary in the early 1960's. She is very good in this. Unfortunately she doesn't get a lot of help. Nicholas Clay would later play Lancelot in Excalibur and appear with an allstar cast in Agatha Christie's Evil Under the Sun but he was just too inexperienced here. For whatever reason there was a plethora of handsome but psychotic young men in British movies at this time and this role might have been better played by another handsome young psycho actor like Shane Bryant or Hywell Bennett although neither of them might have been very convincing as a roughneck construction worker. If it have been made a decade or so earlier though it would have been a PERFECT role for a young Oliver Reed.The directing is also a little flat generally but the first murder following a motorcycle ride is pretty inspired. The Bernard Hermann score is not one of his best but it does add SOMETHING to the proceedings. This isn't great but it certainly deserves to be more widely seen.".

	schema:headline " The Night Digger";
	schema:reviewBody "Troubled young man Nicholas Clay named Billy is able to charm his way into the pitiable household of a blind overbearing elderly woman named Edith Prince Pamela Brown and her browbeaten tired adopted daughter Maura Patricia Neal. What the women are unaware of is that he's a serial killer mostly of pretty young women around his age with brown short hair styles and petite builds. Gradually as he repairs the outer structure of the decaying mansion think Grey Gardens as the two women are middle aged and elderly the two become dependent on him even as Billy starts to become consumed by the monster inside him cultivated and unyielding due to a past trauma when he was a young teenage boy molested by hideous hag countryside farm women. As Billy starts to become more and more withdrawn from Edith he does bond closely with Maura who once left her mother for a man when she was twenty. When Maura was debilitated by an aneurysm Edith helped her back to health. Then when Edith suffered an illness which blinded her Maura returned the favor and has been under her thumb every since for twenty years or so. As a nosy busybody friend of Edith's named Millicent Jean Anderson stirs the pot understanding that Maura is attracted to Billy she tries to nudge Edith into realizing that her gardenerhandyman is bad news. Billy might just be the wedge to force apart the two women and this could finally be the motivation Maura needs to free herself from Edith's overwhelming control.Dark film was written by Roald Dahl yes that Roald Dahl of the children's books and the score by Bernard Hermmann recalls the best of Hitchcock. While the murders are carefully avoided Billy's succumbing to the dark passenger that wants him to kill is well executed. You can see he is unable to resist his murderous impulses. The romantic angle between a middle aged woman rotting inside due to her mother's burdensome expectations to be coddled and spoiled with the yearning for a male companion she can love and the young man who emerges as the possible savior needed to urge her to move on was perhaps a bit too far fetched for me to personally swallow. Particularly the ending where the two run off to the Scottish Highlands to live in a cottage only for their brief happiness to be shattered due to his inability to keep what lies within at bay I was quite surprised the film went this route. The film has Billy needing Maura as he seems desperate to stop killing admitting that his problem overtakes him and he can't remember committing the acts he never technically admits to killing so Maura can only comfort him when he requests her not to leave his side while he tries to rest. The cast is top notch with notable work even from Graham Crowden as a rather oddball church choir instructor a little bit too knowledgeable of the killing spree overtaking England and quite a gossipspreader as is Millicent always up to no good with Edith all too fascinated by what she hears. There's a bit of adult comedy involving the priest and his wife regarding an external operation that is shared by Edith Millicent and Crowden's Mr. Bolton that should amuse. MGM didn't get behind this film and it fell into obscurity but I think The Night Digger is a bonafide cult film ready for an audience to see it. Patricia Neal returned from a stroke not long before this and her work is exemplary. It is all there on her face and seeing her character slowly gain courage to approach leaving her mother and admitting her feelings for Billy is just a part of what makes this film a must for Neal fans. Going from a wallflower old maid resigned to her servitude to a woman reaching forward for her independence is satisfying...even if it involved a psychotic with a complex towards most women. His steadily growing defiance as Edith starts to take some of what she uses against Maura in an effort to force him into becoming another victim of her every whim is what ultimately destroys the superficial bind that tied them temporarily. The mansion setting is rich in set design and old history detail...it is as if Mama Bates had a hand in its decor and was responsible for the architectural look of the place. The space and expansive furnishings can be quite an eyeful. Not only the inside but the outer farreaching exterior of the mansion is quite towering and decadent with the garden and back yard just as elaborate. As extravagant as the demands and personality of the woman who owns it the house could only fit Edith Prince.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm surprised that this particular film isn't as well known as The Night Digger is an effectively expressive British psychological thriller penned by Roald Dahl with a touch of Gothic drama psychosexual unease and sinister moods. The performances of the cast do go a long way to carrying the intrigue and ambiance where Patricia Neal Pamela Brown and a very brooding Nicholas Clay do an outstanding job. Neal's repressed turn really is one of great strength and emotion while Brown authentically commands the screen as the demanding disabled mother. Clay has a charm about him but lurking underneath is something unsettling. The relationship that slowly builds between Neal and Clay's characters is affecting that when she becomes suspicious of him due to the disappearances of young woman in the area. She just doesn't want to believe he has anything to do with it despite knowing he surely does. She yearned for something meaningful and that was him as he brings out the confidence in her and of course she loves the man. So they run away together. The moments when she finally confronts him over it while terse it remains powerful. Even the sequences with Neal and Brown adopted daughter and mother crafted out gripping exchanges. The scenes involving the murders or even the lead up to them where he torments the victim are truly creepy and Bernard Herrmann's subtle but tense score paints it nicely. This is setup in an remote country mansion within a small rural town so town gossip features prominently and is somewhat a driving force for some key plot progressions. So is the loneliness of Neal's frustrated character which Clay's character takes advantage of and so does Brown's. The pacing is causal but it helps the atmosphere build and lets the character's form shape.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film apparently went under two titles The Night Digger and The Road Builder. I caught this film on Turner Classic Movies recently. I have always been a big Patricia Neal fan. The film was released in 1971 a tough time for actors like Neal from the golden age of Hollywood. The times were changing fast and film was going right with them. Middleaged actors like Neal often had trouble finding film work as producers and studios were catering to much younger audiences. Anyway the story revolves around Maura Patricia Neal a spinster whose life revolves taking care of her domineering blind mother Edith Pamela Brownin a decaying England mansion. Enter a handsome handyman named Billy Nicholas Clay to turn their world upside down. Billy is quite a disturbed young man with a small problem murdering women! We are given only small clues as to what turned him into such a maniac seen in somewhat confusing flashbacks. Maura falls for Billy despite the obvious age difference. We learn she probably eventually catches on to what he is doing although she never really says so. The performances are good in this film. I loved Neal especially she portrays the dowdy Maura with her usual intelligence and natural abilities. Pamela Brown as the overbearing mother is also effective. As to the young actor Nicholas Clay he is wonderfully creepy as the the seriously disturbed murderer. The big problems with the film are the script and the obvious lack of a budget to make this film more credible. The script was written by Roald Dahl Patricia Neal's husband of that time. Apparently the back story is Neal did not really want to do the film but Dahl wrote it for her. The story has some confusing gaps and the last 15 minutes or so of the film is just downright ridiculous and tough to believe. This is a case of good actors stuck in a mediocre film that could have been a more worthy one.".

	schema:reviewBody "There might be spoilers here. Gonna try to keep from it but I have to describe the plot as I heard it verses what it really was when I saw the film. THE NIGHT DIGGER also known as THE ROAD BUILDER was a movie I read about that sounded interesting. It seems a spinster and her mother are in an old decaying mansion in England when a young man comes along to stay with them and work as a handy man while also working as a builder on a road being constructed. It seems this young guy is a psycho who also rapes and kills women and buries them in the road. Meanwhile the spinster is taking a shine to him. Sounded like the recipe for a pretty good thriller to me. Well in spite of Bernard Herrmann's score and Alex Thompson's excellent moody cinematography this film doesn't play out anything like I thought it would have. The plot takes detours that really made me wonder if the director knew he was supposed to be making a horror film. There comes one part that has several people sitting around gossiping and although I imagined a suspenseful thriller where you wondered if the old woman and her mother are in danger someone maybe the director or maybe Roald Dahl pretty much succeed in killing any degree of suspense. It's almost like they decided to shoot a scary movie and then later tried to turn it into something else altogether. It has gloomy cinematography and a fine score and even a kind of threatening title but that's where the horrorsuspense elements end. The movie fizzles badly and the climax is just plain stupid. Maybe I was supposed to be moved or sympathetic or something but I just thought the movie was creepy for all the wrong reasons. BEWARE! BIG SPOILER!!!!Still with me? Okay there is a sex scene with the young man and old Patricia Neal. Luckily you don't see much but just the thought of the young dude having sex with that old woman was about the creepiest thing I can think of in this entire movie. If she had been the young Patricia Neal from 20 years before this film was made then fine a sex scene might not have been so terrible but this was disgusting. When I read the title NIGHT DIGGER I expected a movie where Patricia Neal discovers her handyman's is the murderer and her having to fight him off and struggle to survive. I imagined a pretty interesting plot when I read the title. Be assured that there is nothing in this film that is suspenseful scary or thrilling unless you like watching old people have sex with young people which is shot in front of a blurry lens presumably to keep the audience from throwing up. Given the same exact actors crew locations and budget I could have made a film that would have had audiences on the edge of their seats until the end credits. Someone took a good premise a good crew great locations sets and actors and made a boring film about a guy who kills goodlooking women and sleeps with old women who used to be goodlooking. I wasn't impressed at all and cannot recommend this film  at least not as a thrillerhorror film which it was intended to be. No blood no gore no action. Just old ladies psycho roadbuilders and boredom.".

	schema:headline " An impressive achievement but not for everyone.";
	schema:reviewBody "As with Patlabor 1 there's a facade of misleading marketing around this film. There's a picture of a big robot on the packaging and any teaser will probably promise you a nonstop mecha blasting fest. This is simply put a shameless lie. Patlabor 2 is a political thriller often likened to a Tom Clancy novel with good reasons and a very slow brooding talky philosophical one at that. Big robots just happen to exist in it's setting but their presence in the film is so slight you'll hardly notice them.What you will notice however are some wonderful visuals and music and a story that asks the viewer many daring insightful questions about the world of today.The plot centers around a few terrorist attacks on Tokyo taking place in the winter of 2002 note that the film was made in 1993. Most of these attacks are really fake or harmless makebelieveattacks but they're enough to create panic and to cause the established sense of security to crumble to bits. Captains Gotoh and Nagumo of the Special Vehicle Units try to unmask the man and especially the ideas behind these staged attacks. Everything points to a certain Yukihito Tsuge who's an old familiar of Nagumo.What makes this film special is the way we're given insights into Tsuge's beliefs through the dialogues. The viewer is directly confronted with some very powerful questions. The state of being that we call peace in the western world  just how peaceful is it really? How fragile is it and how much do we deserve this relative 'peace' compared to the prices mostly others pay for it? The film is rife with such questions and they leave a considerable impact on the viewer. I daresay Patlabor 2 is worth it's price alone for being confronted with such thoughtprovoking issues set to some of the most beautifully haunting images and music ever put on screen.The animation is definitely finelycrafted there's a scene where helicopters swoop over the city who's smoothness has to be seen to be believed but it's biggest strong point is the way it's all been directed. Slow sweeping shots of the intricate semifuturistic cityscape are the order of the day with many other impressively beautiful shots.But it's the music that really stole the show for me with a wonderful use of mostly gentle and haunting melodies. The soundtrack is a true masterpiece whose tunes will remain with you for a long time after viewing the film. It adds a dimension to the atmosphere that really can't be described very well on paper so I'll just say it's powerful and beautifullycrafted stuff. The image of snowflakes drifting down onto tanks stationed all over Tokyo while a soft ghostly melody plays in the background is a good example of the sort of moment where Patlabor 2 shines.It doesn't shine all the way though. There are a few flaws to this film which make it hard to recommend to everybody. The talkiness for one thing sometimes really goes overthetop. Instead of showing you what happened a pretty important development is sometimes only mentioned in a conversation. This makes it difficult to keep up all the time especially as the viewer is sometimes assumed to be an expert on political powergames Some minister has just done something or other and then this and that happened I see... that means soandso plans to do yakkitysomething... Dialogues like that pop up a few times in the film and manage to be pretty unpleasant. Likewise there's no gentle introduction to Patlabor newcomers so it's recommended that you've seen at least the first Patlabor movie before tackling this. While the few scenes of how the regular Patlabor cast have gotten on with their lives are fairly unimportant being at least somewhat familiar with them is a welcome help in following a sometimes overwhelmingly complex film I mean that in a good way though .Patlabor 2 will never be suited to general public tastes as it's simply too complex talky and basically 'different' for anyone just seeking some escapist fun. The DragonBall and Akira crowd need not look into this until they've learned to stop referring to the anime medium as 'mnga movies' while mistaking it for a slew of violent cyberpunk slop which they consider 'kewl' or 'kickass' or whatever. Same to the general Hollywood crowd who'd freak out at the idea of a film demanding efforts from the viewer  Patlabor 2 demands lots of efforts but has something special to reward you with.Patlabor 2 serves it's doses of food for thought raw and it takes some effort to swallow them. But I'd say that effort is well worth it. For the unique powerful atmosphere alone this is more than worth a look. I guess haunting is really the most suitable word to describe Patlabor 2's superb feel. It literally does haunt you with questions about the state of the society we live in that you can't possibly turn a blind eye on in fact after the attacks on America in September 2001 Patlabor 2's messages have become ironically uptodate in their relevance. And a film that achieves such effects so very well deserves to be seen and to be praised. And then there's that music. Absolutely brilliant it makes this film a musthear as well as a mustsee.".

	onyx:emotionText "As with Patlabor 1 there's a facade of misleading marketing around this film. There's a picture of a big robot on the packaging and any teaser will probably promise you a nonstop mecha blasting fest. This is simply put a shameless lie. Patlabor 2 is a political thriller often likened to a Tom Clancy novel with good reasons and a very slow brooding talky philosophical one at that. Big robots just happen to exist in it's setting but their presence in the film is so slight you'll hardly notice them.What you will notice however are some wonderful visuals and music and a story that asks the viewer many daring insightful questions about the world of today.The plot centers around a few terrorist attacks on Tokyo taking place in the winter of 2002 note that the film was made in 1993. Most of these attacks are really fake or harmless makebelieveattacks but they're enough to create panic and to cause the established sense of security to crumble to bits. Captains Gotoh and Nagumo of the Special Vehicle Units try to unmask the man and especially the ideas behind these staged attacks. Everything points to a certain Yukihito Tsuge who's an old familiar of Nagumo.What makes this film special is the way we're given insights into Tsuge's beliefs through the dialogues. The viewer is directly confronted with some very powerful questions. The state of being that we call peace in the western world  just how peaceful is it really? How fragile is it and how much do we deserve this relative 'peace' compared to the prices mostly others pay for it? The film is rife with such questions and they leave a considerable impact on the viewer. I daresay Patlabor 2 is worth it's price alone for being confronted with such thoughtprovoking issues set to some of the most beautifully haunting images and music ever put on screen.The animation is definitely finelycrafted there's a scene where helicopters swoop over the city who's smoothness has to be seen to be believed but it's biggest strong point is the way it's all been directed. Slow sweeping shots of the intricate semifuturistic cityscape are the order of the day with many other impressively beautiful shots.But it's the music that really stole the show for me with a wonderful use of mostly gentle and haunting melodies. The soundtrack is a true masterpiece whose tunes will remain with you for a long time after viewing the film. It adds a dimension to the atmosphere that really can't be described very well on paper so I'll just say it's powerful and beautifullycrafted stuff. The image of snowflakes drifting down onto tanks stationed all over Tokyo while a soft ghostly melody plays in the background is a good example of the sort of moment where Patlabor 2 shines.It doesn't shine all the way though. There are a few flaws to this film which make it hard to recommend to everybody. The talkiness for one thing sometimes really goes overthetop.

I enjoyed every second although some other commenters found the slow parts boring or irrelevant.The music or lack thereof is also definitely worth a mention. It's hard to describe  I just couldn't imagine it being any different for this movie. The reason I write lack of music is because there are scenes where any Hollywoodproducer would have slapped on some generic classical music but in this case there is none. For example there is a scene after a climax where you just see different parts of the cityscape with snow falling and there is no sound at all. THAT's moviemagic. It's part of what draws me to this strange exotic type of movies  it's so different than what most of us are used to.Recreate the visuals using a filmcamera actors and a specialeffects crew copypaste the music label it made in Hollywood and you've got yourself a blockbusterhit!Japanese cartoons are for kids  not.

It is so deep and thought provoking that you should watch it more than once to catch all of the details. It is hard to tell the difference of all of the Japanese names of the characters which can get a little annoying. This movie is very meditative in that it has many scenes where there are just two people talking and you get views of the city. During these dialogues they questions on wars and peace.

After watching this and getting all the numerous relationships right I still felt noteably unsatisfied.Patlabor 2 is a very stylishly directed story of Japan in the near future being held hostage by a terrorist who masterminds a breakdown of civil rule in retribution for the government's incompetence.  At the beginning of the movie his machinations are set in motion and at the end there is the lacklustre uninspired payoff.  Inbetween lies the sprinkling of philosophical monologues of sporadic merit all the while the plot somehow unfolds.I say somehow because I really don't know how.  I guess I'll have to take the characters' words for it because for the better part of the picture their blatant expositions are the only way the audience finds out that something really big supposedly just happened  talk about phoned in. For all it's stylish direction and philosophising characters Patlabor 2 leaves the viewer with very little to digest about it's characters and universe and as such does equally little to justify being a motion picture.24".

	schema:reviewBody "I have an odd history with the Patlabor series of Japanese Anime' OVAs TV shows comics and featurelength Anime' films.I saw Patlabor The Movie 1989 when it was first released in a limited edition DVD set back in 2006. I had the good fortune of watching the movie over the Fourth of July weekend that year and I must say that I remember thoroughly enjoying the picture for what it was a detective story mixed with a strong science fiction backdrop laced with all sorts of thematic material about technology's ascension over human beings there is little doubt in my mind that the story was inspired by Blade Runner.But I've only seen the movie once unfortunately which was just that one time. Now over the Christmas break 2012 I have the fortune of watching the film's sequel Patlabor 2 The Movie. If you remember the series is set over what at that time was the future 19982002. The story involved large robots called Labors that were used for both construction work and law enforcement duties the series focused mostly on the law enforcement Labors which are called Patrol Labors Patlabors.Mamoru Oshii most famous for the 1995 scifi cyberthriller Ghost in the Shell returns for the directorial duties of the sequel as does Kazunori Ito on the screenplay who also worked on the script for Ghost which is set three years after Patlabor The Movie. The film shifts the focus of the story from Noa Izumi and Asuma Shinohara the plucky heroine and hero of the first movie to Kiichi Gotoh the understated yet calculating commander of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's 2nd Special Vehicles Section SV2 Division 2. He and his immediate superior Commander Shinobu Nagumo attempt to investigate a series of terrorist incidents that they believe are the work of a disgruntled exJapanese SelfDefense Forces officer named Yukihito Tsuge. His main goal appears to be revenge for a failed United Nations Labor operation in Southeast Asia three years earlier in 1999.Patlabor 2 The Movie is a very plotheavy film with a strong political subtext meant to raise questions about Japan's place in world affairs in the late 20th centuryearly 21st century. Make no mistake this is a politicallycharged Anime' film one that may be lost on nonJapanese audiences that addresses Japan's role as a forcibly pacifist society as a result of its defeat in World War II. According to Carl Gustav Horn in the booklet for the DVD of JinRoh The Wolf Brigade 1998 Tsuge's campaign of domestic terrorism is meant to force Japan to face up to its largest political contradiction Its forced rejection of war as a result of Article 9 of the 1947 Japanese Constitution  which was written by the Allies not the Japanese people themselves and the fact that Japan must rely on the United States for its primary defense as a result of the U.S.Japan Mutual Defense Treaty of 1954. Tsuge's plan in effect almost brings Japan to the brink of war. It is a troubling question but a thoughtful one of what Japan should do to defend itself  without violating its commitment to peace or at least within the confines of stiff Article 9 regulations.Patlabor 2 The Movie is a great film one that may not be as actionpacked as the first movie but it's a more thoughtful picture than the first movie.1010".

There are long beautiful pans of demonic cityscapes set to the haunting score composed by Kenji Kawaii. There are complex philosophical problems that trouble the two protagonists on a personal level whom seem to have some sort of unresolved sexual tension going on. There is a heavy intricate plot that while puzzling at first eventually is resolved through brilliant detective work. And the end all the culminated tension violently explodes onscreen. Now let me tell you about Patlabor 2. It's beautifully animated. There are long beautiful pans of demonic cityscapes set to the haunting score composed by Kenji Kawaii. There are complex philosophical problems that trouble the two protagonists on a personal level whom seem to have some sort of unresolved sexual tension going on. There is a heavy intricate plot that while puzzling at first eventually is resolved through brilliant detective work. And the end all the culminated tension violently explodes onscreen. That's right this Patlabor movie is the exact same movie as Ghost in the Shell or pretty much any Oshii film I've seen other than the Sky Crawlers which was atrocious. But I give it a perfect 10... why is that? Because it is flawless. There is nothing wrong with this film. The characters are beautifully written the plot is though confusing complex and laden with important social issues that were not only issues for Japan in the early 90s but issues that people in the US today. I don't really want to give too much away but you'll see what I mean. And then there's Arakawa who is a brilliant character and fit right in with the atmosphere of the movie. If there is one word to describe this movie it is atmospheric. You should expect no less from the guy who directed Ghost in the Shell right? Yet I feel in some ways this movie is superior to GITS. All the characters here are involving I've only seen the first two Patlabor movies whereas the characters in Ghost in the Shell are welldeveloped but cold and stoic. In Patlabor 2 the characters are not warm or fuzzy but are realistic realists. They're brilliant. If there was any problem with this film its that it is very very dialog heavy. If you don't pay attention to what the characters are saying you're left out of the loop. But you will pay attention because what they say is just so engaging. Remember the old adage 'show don't tell'? Well forget it. Go watch Patlabor 2.".

I should note first I loved the animation and it's really the strongest point of the movie. Scenes are incredibly detailed facial expressions are well done cityscapes and vehicles are gorgeous. There are also some really great meditative shots in the movie that really do a excellent job to set the atmosphere. However the story is where this movie starts to fall apart.First of all this next section will have spoilers so don't read if you haven't watched this movie. I have never watched the Patlabor anime so perhaps my dislike of the story is because of this but I just found everything that happened in the movie as too thin to be plausible in the storyline. There is a rogue faction in the military that wants to create chaos and...to do something because they don't like the peace settled after WW2 and they want to shake stuff up or something like that. And that's the thing there was nothing in the movie that made sense with respect to the antagonist's motivations. In fact their motivations are only discussed through philosophical musings similar to high school level views of international relations the developed world enjoys peace at the expense of the war torn nations or something so down with the system. It all sounded very juvenile to me.So after the antagonists initiate a terrorist attack somehow the government makes the incredibly stupid decision to stick their heads in the sand pretend that nothing happened until they can't in which case they blame the military. Then the completely unlikely event of a military coup happens... why? because well they don't like being blamed. What's the military's goal for the coup? It's never said all that's said is that they think the civilian government is weak and they know there's some nefarious guy involved in the terrorist attacks but they won't go after them for some reason even though he's hanging out in plain sight jamming everyone's communications in the middle of Tokyo harbor. So this leaves our plucky band of heroes to do the job because they're the only ones in Tokyo that have a moral compass or something like that. In summary watch this movie for the great animation but don't bother reading into the story too much. There's also some philosophical musings along the way but they don't have much weight to them. Which leaves some good action scenes and atmospheric shots to enjoy but not a whole lot else.".

Right alongside Einstein. Some topics are too complex for words alone. This masterful director has found a way to make difficult subjects accessible to us ordinary humans. Historical attempts at exploring complex matters have been required to analyze all the little factors to the point that years of study are required for adequate comprehension. Pictures are worth a thousand words. A movie is many pictures backed up by dialog and as such may be the perfect medium to explore complex topics.Mr. Oshii presents a subject and explores it for a few scenes. After completing his idea he then lets the information soak in by using scenes with no dialog music or complicated scenery. Then this wonderful director examines another facet of the message that he is trying to convey followed by some more quiet time to think about it. Masterful! Patlabor 2 was released in 1993. In the movie an incident occurred that was eerily close to a military scenario conceptualized years before. That was in the movie. That scenario was eerily close to 911. Yes. I am saying that my reality as an American in 2012 is very similar to the political reality in Patlabor 2. Shockingly so. I did not see any analysis that pointed this out so here it is.

Before you tear me up for 'not getting it' or 'only liking anime for the sex and violence' let me explain that neither of those points are true. Patlabor 2 did have incredible albeit boring visuals to compliment its deep albeit boring story. The main character constantly waxes philosophical about war peace and society usually while looking at the city or riding in a car on a periodically lit street. This all combines to create an unspectacular overlong story with too much talking and too little doing.  This would've been better as a monologue by the Captain and not as an attempted action movie. In that same vein GIANT ROBOTS that only once get used! Even the one and only battle scene is slow. If I wanted philosophies on War and Peace I'd read Tolstoy. Let the giant mechs do what they do best beat the crap outta other robots. This movie tried to do too much and disappointed at all. To explain my subject line  I believe that those who compliment this movie would've walked out if it had been presented as a live action film. 510 only for the nice visuals and what little learning anyone can glean from the philosophical police captain.".

This film is flatout ridiculous but its also oddly riveting and blackly comical. There are some laughoutloud moments to be found here especially near the end. There are also some eyepleasing sets and more atmospheric architecture with lots and lots of ticking clocks. The visual style of the film really won me over and made it a very engaging experience. This is the most entertaining of the Housemaid installments and I'd go so far as to say that it's the most entertaining pre1990 South Korean film I've seen to this point.

	schema:reviewBody "The main complaint from those who dislike Patlabor the movie is that it's too slow and dull. Not to act like the brighterthanthou intello snob here but this never even remotely bothered me. Maybe it's because there are enough riveting action scenes to counterbalance the slower ones or because a lot of the nonaction scenes are spent on a believeable buildup to make the finale all the more poignant while throwing in genuinely interesting issues and fleshing out the likeable characters in a very entertaining way. Or maybe it's because I saw Patlabor 2 first which makes this first film seem lightning quick in comparison. All the same I really don't see what there is to complain about. Patlabor takes the time needed to establish a coherent storyline and the viewer is amply rewarded by a big and very thrilling dose of action in the end made all the more involving by the intricate prior buildup that we've been following. Even after several viewings I find myself fully satisfied at the film's end and perhaps even intellectually stimulated without this demanding excessive efforts on my behalf. True this is at times a talky and rather philosophical film but nothing that the average viewer should find impossible to sit through that is unless I'm being too optimistic in my views on general human intelligence and the world really is overrun by bovine straight jocks who's attention cannot last two minutes without massive explosions onscreen.Mamoru Oshii's direction style has a reputation of being very slow and broody. From what I've seen of his work this is quite true. So far Patlabor is the movie where this style worked best for me as everything fitted together very nicely delivering an excellently balanced combo of entertainment and mental fodder other films by him show his personal touch more clearly but are less 'easily accessible'.That is far from the only praiseworthy point in Patlabor however. Animation and artwork are pleasingly solid overall ascending to excellent levels when the intricately crafted scenes with the mecha come into play. Kudos to the music as well which does it's thing very nicely. The fast pieces for the action scenes are especially good for the way they're so full of energy. It also does a very good job of establishing the Patlabor universe for the noninitiated viewer. This movie is but one gear in the works of a much larger franchise Patlabor has spawned several TV and video series over the years but the viewer is adequately told who is who and where they are to be able to follow the movie without prior experience.The clever bit about the Patlabor universe is it's a downtoearth credible view of what the world might look like if there was such a thing as giant robots. The robots are not overly fanciful nor are they even the defining factor in everyone's life. Despite Noah's attachment to her Labor which she named Alphonse the robots serve as little more than bigger stronger versions of everyday vehicles and machines with not one infantile giant laser weapon in sight that said their design is very cool including enough striking elements in their otherwise workmanlike and realistic appearance to be very noteworthy. It's still the little people that make the most difference and are the real stars in the Patlabor world. Top marks for originality there.The same thing goes for the film's plot after the suicide of a certain Eiichiro Hoba an increased number of incidents involving Labors gone berserk begins to spread over Japan. Our heroes are a somewhat whacky squad of anti Laborcrime officers the 'mobile police' who operate with their Patrol Labors or Patlabors who gradually unravel the entire plot behind this wave of labor malfunctions and the true disaster that this is building up to  a disaster of such magnitude that it may well signal doomsday if the one building that will trigger it off isn't destroyed by hand and by Labor in the little time that is left. There's far more to the story than just that  there are the likeable hijinks of the heroes along the way as well as the more broody look at Hoba's motivations that get exposed by a private eye packed with deep reflections and religious symbolism a socalled 'Babylon Project' to build a new district for Tokyo over the water plays a large part in the film to name but one example.It probably is more of a thinking man's giant robot anime in the end. But this should be noted as great praise rather than a complaint from those too stupid to appreciate it. Everything is wellcrafted involving and enjoyable enough to make for a very impressive film that can be recommended to everyone except complete numbskulls. I'd almost go so far as to claim that anyone who doesn't realise the great qualities of this film must be out of his mind but that would be just petty personal vengeance on my behalf. You see with the way this film is so excellent stylish and highly likeable overall I'm afraid I've rather fallen in love with it. Well worth checking out at any rate.".

Somehow it also gained the notoriety for extreme sex and violence though it's a misconception that all Japanese animation is about that.  Yet animation in general is viewed as a kids only fare.I recommend anyone to watch Patlabor the movie.  It has a very mature storyline.  When I mean mature I meant wellthought out story that can leave you thinking.In the future giant industrial utility robots called labors are used throughout Japan.  Those in the law enforcement department use labors called Patlabors patrol labors.  Lately there are reports of labors running amuck on its own.  From this point we follow the heroes in a detective like story.There are no nudity violence is pretty tame compared to your halfhour dose of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers a series also a byproduct of Japan I know but I'm not here to discuss my distaste for the Rangers TV show.  What we have is a straightforward mystery as the story unravels what is going on. It also explores about man and technology and how it's like the Tower of Babel in biblical literature.The movie is based on the tv show and comic.  I only got to see a few episodes of the show. The movie like the show do not have the robots dominating the story thus focusing more on the human characters.  Watching the movie I almost feel like I'm watching a PGPG13 liveaction movie. Akira and Ghost in the Shell also have a deep story in them it's not as involving perhaps they were covered so much cinematic effects and sex and violence?.  Patlabor blew me away in that it successfully simply told an honesttogoodness story without being covered in so much effects.The verdict 5 of 5 stars.".

Labors are manned humanoid machines used in heavy lifting construction and peacekeeping domestic  military tasks. The action is split between the policemen who struggle to contain the destruction as the first infected Labors begin to malfunction and a pair of detectives who painstakingly retrace the dead doctors last steps before his suicide.

I was looking for action and fast paced animation with cool angles and a good backstory.  Instead I found a movie that focuses on the crew members instead.  The robots ARE the backstory.  For the most part I can live with that. I did enjoy the first Patlabor movie more than the second one.  The 'labors' played a bigger role in this movie and thusly there was a good balance between them and the crew members.  In Patlabor 2 the robots were showcased very briefly.All I can think of is one thing  If the creators are not going to focus on the robots then why mention them in the title? Why mention them at all? One could rewrite the second movie to completely eliminate the 'labor' robots and the story would still hold with barely a scratch.If you are planning to watch any of the Patlabor movies then remember that it is not an actionanime movie about 'labor' robots and their crew. Rather it can best be described as a futuristic detective story that happen to be in a time where 'labor' robots are around and in use.  It will involve your attention.It's not an ideal movie for those interested in getting into Anime films. I'd only recommend Patlabor to an older animeexperienced audience.Interesting Note  On the DVD read the subtitles and then watch the English version or visaversa.  In many cases you will find scenes where the characters are talking about a completely different topic.  It's quite fascinating.".

The plot moves along at the right kind of pace  brisk enough to keep the viewer interested but relaxed enough to allow one to savour the rich atmosphere of the world Ishii creates.If there's a problem then it stems simply from the fact that this is what it is a spinoff movie which is only part of an ongoing series. As such and great as the characters may be there is very little in terms of development  next to none in fact. Yes this is an expected and necessary result of the movie's very nature it can't do anything that's really going to significantly affect the plot line of the series still it dulls the impact of an otherwise excellent film. Of course there may be and I expect there are many nuances of dialogue story etc. that are lost on a viewer with no prior knowledge of the series and perhaps viewing the film in context would provide a more rounded experience.

I was surprised several times of the awesomeness for instance when the rescueteam reaches the arc that lays in the dark. The atmosphere of that particular scene reminded me strongly of Alien which is also a very good movie I might add.

	schema:headline " A landmark piece for a genius director";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Mamoru Oshii is best known for his 1995 scifi landmark piece Ghost in the Shell and less so for his meditative 1985 arthouse piece Angel's Egg but Mobile Police Patlabor The Movie remains as an interesting touchstone for the development of the genius director. Based on the manga and OVA series of the same name the film takes place in Japan in the near future where giant robots or 'Patlabors' have revolutionised industry. In the wake of global warming and overpopulation the Japanese government begins the 'Babylon Project' which will reclaim thousands of acres of land from the Tokyo seafront by utilising the power of the Patlabors which are hundreds of times more efficient than human workers. Yet a series of worrying incidents where Patlabors go berserk and cause great destruction sets Asuma of the 'Mobile Police'  a section of the metropolitan police that utilises the Patlabors to fight crime  on the case and the mystery he plunges into has far more dangerous consequences than he ever imagined.The rich world building and level of detail in the film that would later play a major part in the appeal of Ghost in the Shell is evident here even in this early part of Oshii's career. Each line of dialogue is utilised efficiently to discuss geopolitics bureaucracy and engineering in this fictional future. The level of detail put into the design of the Patlabor's themselves by Yutaka Izubuchi also helps further reinforce this realistic yet relatable tone.Although the film doesn't do a great job getting new viewers of the series up to speed leaving several blind spots such as the sudden appearance of Kanuka Clancy in the third act it does a good job of introducing us to the characters of Asuma and Nao who's chemistry in turns drives the soul of the film alongside the richly detailed fictional landscape. Asuma's work on solving the mystery is also far from perfect sometimes overloading viewers with exposition instead of explanation but for the most part he's an engaging point of focus for the viewer mainly thanks to Toshio Furukawa's excellent voice work.In terms of Oshii's later career a lot of his tendencies can be traced back to this formative work. Namely his eye for detail and preference for dialogue instead of action. Plus his visual direction is as excellent as you'd expect giving us striking compositions and engaging framing. Yet this is at the same time the least Oshiiesque film in his career since it comes across as less of an Oshii film like with Ghost in the Shell and Angel's Egg and more of a Oshiidirected Patlabor film. Even so whether you're an Oshii newbie or an Oshii expert a Patlabor newbie or a Patlabor expert there's definitely something for you here. And who doesn't want to see giant robots duking it out anyway?".

	schema:headline " Patlabor The Movie 1989 review...";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this one first back in the summer of 2006.It must be said that widely acclaimed Japanese animation Anime' director Mamoru Oshii is one of the most distinguished personalities in all of Anime'. His most famous work  and my personal favorite film of his  is 1995's Ghost in the Shell which gained added popularity in the United States and around the rest of the world for its apparent influence on The Matrix and its sequels.Before Ghost in the Shell though he was probably most famous for his work on the Patlabor series of films which were adapted from a popular Manga Japanese comic and TV series  both of which Ishii himself cocreated based on original concepts by Yuuki Masami alongside longtime collaborator Kazunori Ito and several others. The first in the series was 1989's Patlabor The Movie. While a little confusing at times I got through it with little difficulty. The story itself is engaging but I actually save my best praises for this film's darker superior politicallycharged and mature 1993 sequel Patlabor 2 The Movie.Patlabor The Movie is set in Japan in the late '90s the thenfuture where mankind is aided in everyday tasks like construction work by Labors giant robots that are operated by specially trained humans. They are also used extensively in military and law enforcement duties the series focuses mostly on the Patrol Labors Patlabors that are being used by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police force.The plot gets moving when the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's 2nd Special Vehicles Section SV2 begins investigating a series of incidents where Labors of differing size and operations begin malfunctioning all across the city. The young SV2 operative Asuma Shinohara alongside female SV2 pilot and close associate Noa Izumi suspects that a new operating system OS that had recently been installed to over 80 of the labors in the city is what is causing the malfunctions. The OS was written and designed by Eiichiro Hoba  who committed suicide just five days before the story begins  with the intention that all Labors installed with the program deliberately malfunction if a series of specific conditions are met like high winds generating lowfrequency soundwaves all across the city for example. The nowdeceased Hoba had become obsessed with the Babylon Project  a series of manmade islands in the Tokyo Bay area and its nerve center the Ark Hoba's fixation was on the obvious biblical allusions to the Ark as in Noah's Ark  and specifically targeted the Labors involved in its construction.Patlabor The Movie is quite an early achievement from Mamoru Oshii and shows many of his trademark filmmaking signatures that would become more apparent over the course of his career. The numerous biblical references the deep involving plot and colorful multidimensional cast of characters the moody atmospheric score by frequent collaborator Kenji Kawai and philosophical musings about technology run amok in the thenfuture all appear here. It's an astounding piece of animation though as I stated earlier it's not as good as its darker more mature and plotheavy sequel Patlabor 2 The Movie.810".

The quality of animation was slightly above the OAV's and the character designs also kept closely to the OAV as opposed to the more mature look in P2.As I understood the plot a mysterious hacker introduced a virus into the operating system called H.O.S. or Hyper Operating System for ALL labors in Japan. This virus could cause unmanned units to go beserk and is activated by a unique ultrasound frequency created at random by the gusty winds that blow across the Tokyo skyline.Tied in to all this is the newly completed tower of the Babylon Project to reclaim land in the Tokyo bay. Apparently the tower is a giant tuning fork which could give the doomsday signal when a great storm hits the bay.All this sounds intriguing but it takes way too long for the plot to advance to a coherent stage. There is hardly any action save for the last 20 minutes or so. Most of all I missed the great dialogue and humour in the video and TV series.".

	schema:headline " The Lack of Patlabor is Ignorance";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie Patlabor The Mobile Police is an animated film about a world where robotic machines have been invented to help ease the work load in the labor department and as well used for policing. Soon into the movie you'll learn that the robots start to act on their own and cause destruction in their paths. This brings in the case of who is responsible for this and why this is happening in the first place which helps bring in the backbone and understanding of the main problem in and of itself.Now you're probably wondering why I gave this movie such a low rating right? Compared to great anime series such as Death Note and Code Geass although these are TV series which also has the same investigationtype story to it Patlabor comes nowhere close. What these other two anime's do so well and what Patlabor lacks is the bringing in of the why and how leaving necessary hints throughout the films which gives a mindblownadrenaline rush when everything that's happened and happening finally clicks. Death Note does a fantastic job at explaining on the go of the intentions and plans being put forward and if information is left out it will explain it soon after on why things happened the way they did. Code Geass does very well with explaining the mysterious power behind it and how it works exactly. Sadly these key elements are nowhere to be found in Patlabor.A typical robot malfunction story just done in a different way which in some aspects actually reminded me of the I Robot film starring Will Smith. However the issue in which I soon came to realize is the drastic lack in given information and explanation for situations that arose. One simple example of this is the dry story of the villain Hoshaand I say dry because they really don't give you any information on himin which you find out he's the one who started the malfunctions. But if you think they'll give a background story you'll be disappointed neither are his motives explained when it comes to why he planted viruses in the machines. You'll understand quite vaguely that spoiler alert the reason behind the robots defections are due to a program the creator Hosha preinstalled. Kind of like a virus that goes off when activated by a specific situation with this a certain wind velocity did the trick which also wasn't explained.Looking from this perspective you might be disappointed or it might just be me. But going from this angle while watching this film you might now notice the overall lacking of information given and this is just one scenario. This movie however just doesn't do a good job in bringing explanations into play which help push the story along.Besides the fact that there are sequels to this there still needs to be an understandable plot and story without the help of its sequels. But alas there isn't and because of this Patlabor The Mobile Police shouldn't be on one of your top lists of anime films to see there's so many animated seriesmovies out there that has a lot more in store for you than this.".

Unfortunately however the most outstanding negative feature is not even the direction which exemplifies how any setting can be displayed from the most unflattering and bleak angle from Paris to L.A. with the most uninspired framing you could believe possible or the shaky borderline earthquake documentary camera work nor the dialog which is not a stand out but in the film quality itself. It reminded me of the execrable film grain of the civic education videos they used to project at the cinema before the movie in my home country 25 years ago during the communist era. I guess Demy found a stash somewhere. Slightly worn.Also on an even more humorous note it will provide food for thought for those planning on some day spending a long weekend in Tijuana.".

	schema:reviewBody "While I wouldn't include 'Spellbound' in my top five favourite Alfred Hitchcock movies it's still wonderfully entertaining. Of course it had dated badly in some ways but not enough to spoil a modern viewer's enjoyment. Psychoanalysis was still quite a cinematic novelty at the time but this means that we have to put up with an awkward opening sequence complete with explanations on the screen and a few pretty hokey moments throughout but hey I can live with that and the amateurish filmed skiing scene. These few flaws quite a rarity for Hitchcock are still small potatoes.

	onyx:emotionText "While I wouldn't include 'Spellbound' in my top five favourite Alfred Hitchcock movies it's still wonderfully entertaining. Of course it had dated badly in some ways but not enough to spoil a modern viewer's enjoyment. Psychoanalysis was still quite a cinematic novelty at the time but this means that we have to put up with an awkward opening sequence complete with explanations on the screen and a few pretty hokey moments throughout but hey I can live with that and the amateurish filmed skiing scene. These few flaws quite a rarity for Hitchcock are still small potatoes.

	schema:reviewBody "Spellbound is one of Hitchcock's hardest films to evaluate because its plot and credibility are so heavily dependent on theories of psychoanalysis that are usually considered to be implausible at the very best.  But if you can accept for the sake of entertainment the more dubious plot devices what remains is a fine film dominated by the great director's usual creativity and technical mastery.  Although it's hard to get away from the implausibilities it's a fine movie in all other respects.Gregory Peck stars as an amnesia case and Ingrid Bergman as a psychoanalyst trying to unravel his mysterious  and possibly murderous  past.  Most of the other characters are also psychoanalysts or patients and the plot revolves around the ways that Bergman's character uses Freudian theories to solve the mystery.  Whether you can enjoy the story depends on how willing you are to suspend disbelief concerning the wilder aspects of these theories but if you are willing to do so it's quite nicely done in most parts with some fine scenes and a couple of good plot twists.  It is also worth watching for the famous Salvador Dali dream sequence which is very creatively done and fascinating to watch.  Peck and Bergman also create interesting and sympathetic characters who make the viewer want to know what will happen to them.Overall this is a distinctive film and well worth seeing for any Hitchcock fan.".

Selznick Spellbound stars Ingrid Bergman as Dr. Constance Petersen a compassionate but sexually guarded psychotherapist who falls for Dr Edwardes Gregory Peck a new doctor who arrives at Green Manors the mental asylum at which she works.With a creepy nearsupernatural score by Miklos Rozsa the film oscillates between melodrama and horror. These horrors are largely psychological but Hitchcock's direction and Rozsa's score lend the film a nearparanormal edge. Like Vertigo Spellbound at times feels like a ghost story or perhaps even a story about ghostly possessions. The issue of possession itself becomes the bedrock of Hitchcock's plot. Peck's character is an impostor who has taken possession of Dr Edwardes' persona. From here on the film becomes another of Hitchcock's Kafkaesque wrong man rides. The real Dr Edwardes has turned up dead and law enforcement officials believe Peck to be the murderer. Peck now revealed to be amnesic thus goes on the run. He is supported by Constance who attempts to prove his innocence. With the help of another famous psychoanalyst she delves into Peck's unconscious and comes out with some semblance of truth. It turns out she discovers that Peck has been repressing a very specific childhood trauma as a kid he accidentally killed his brother. The film ends with another revelation the true murderer of Dr Edwardes was an ageing psychoanalyst who himself feared being dispossessed by a younger man.While Peck's an overly stiff actor Bergman is as magnificent as ever affording her character a range of subtle facial gestures and a pleasant mix of intelligence yearning and vulnerability. Hitchcock meanwhile hated hiring Peck but Selznick kept saddling the director with him Selznick thought the actor's good looks would bring in big money.The film sports a now famous dream sequence. It was designed by Salvador Dali the famous surrealist but directed by William Cameron Menzies a man who's been unfairly forgotten by history. The first person to be given the film credits of art director and production designer Menzies is today most well known for directing the surrealistexpressionist Invaders From Mars. He was also responsible for a number of pioneering early special effects and as art director was responsible for the overall look of a number of famous films most notably Gone With the Wind which he storyboarded colour coordinated and co directed. Spellbound's dream sequence was originally about 20 minutes long but was highly censored by Selznick. It contains the animated shadow of a gigantic bird Hitchcock was himself reportedly ornithophobic.Like most of Hitchcock's films our female hero is treated with much condescension by men. One great scene at a train station finds Constance turning this to her advantage feigning naivety and playing to a detective's inflated ego she weasels her way into a hotel room. The rest of the film both mocks and pays tribute to psychoanalysis. One eccentric character's playfully modelled on Freud for example the film's psychoanalytical jargon is comically overwrought and Hitchcock manages to both turn his villain into a psychoanalyst whilst also respectfully turning psychoanalysis into that which solves the film's central crime. Elsewhere the film mistakes psychoanalysis for kitschy dream reading. In Hitchcock's hands psychoanalysts are nothing but art critics who decode or ascribe meaning to various warped visions.In JeanLuc Godard's mammoth Histoires du cinema there's a passage in which he pauses to muse about Hitchcock. Hitch Godard essentially says is less about content than decor bits of scenery camera work clothing props and moments. You see that with Spellbound. What you remember are various fragments powerful pointofview shots a subjective shot of a character drinking milk snowcapped streets and a shockingly frank scene in which a child is impaled on a fence.Upon release Spellbound was embraced by critics and audiences. Today it's typically viewed as being second tier Hitchcock. It's ultimately a potboiler tarnished by silly Freudian symbolism but elevated by exquisite direction and some strong moments of comedy and horror.7.910  Worth one viewing.".

My memories of it were not that fond  I recalled it as an unusually melodramatic and not very convincing thriller enlivened by a very attractive cast.What I had forgotten about was how almost impossibly silly all the psychoanalytical claptrap is especially in the first couple of reels which thereby make us feel very quickly that we're not quite in the mature masterful grip of Hitch's usual wit and taste. Yes I know this was made in the 40's but the first 20 to 30 minutes of the film have more sexist moments and infantile behavior by supposed doctors than one would ever expect from either Hitch or Ben Hecht.So who's to blame? One guess  David O. Selznick! That being said along with the fact that the story doesn't really add up to much of anything since all the premises on which it's based seem so shaky naive and downright goofy the film has some things going for it. About midway through the picture when Michael Chekhov appears as Dr. Brulov the film suddenly kicks into what we might call classic British Hitch mode with the kind of understated wit and ensemble playing the director had been doing so well since the early 30's. It almost becomes another and far more palatable film at this point. The scenes with Bergman Peck and Chekhov are the highlight of the film and I have to admit that I'm even kind of fond of the hotel lobby scene with the appealingly breezy Bill Goodwin of Burns and Allen radio fame as the house detective. Peck has never been more handsome in a strangely fragile way.Also worth a look are the brief but truly unusual Dalidesigned dream sequences. There is something to be said for Miklos Rozsa's score as well although it edges a bit far into soupy overscoring the expressive main theme has quality and his use of the theremin which he also employed in his score for THE LOST WEEKEND at virtually the same time is striking and represented something new in film music.One could easily make excuses for this film based on it was only 1945 or what people knew about psychoanalysis was still naive etc. but even taken in context of its time it's a pretty silly film without the kind of sustained surety of style leavened with simultaneous suspense intelligence taste and humor that he had already proved he could do so well from more than ten years earlier. Given a standard he had already given us with examples from THE 39 STEPS or YOUNG AND INNOCENT through THE LADY VANISHES in the UK or FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT and SHADOW OF A DOUBT here in the US this film seems not up to his true capacities and like his other Selznickproduced American film REBECCA seems both overfussy and filled with emphases and spoonfeeding of details which Hitch himself would never have given us.You need only compare this film with his very next one NOTORIOUS to be painfully aware how much better Hitchcock on his own  using his own standards of pace momentum and the ADULT treatment of script themes  could be when not under the thumb of Selznick.

	schema:reviewBody "Cinema works best as evenhanded nonegotistical collaboration. Total control by one individual can be hitormiss depending on their proficiency. But what is almost always disastrous is the collision between two dominating personalities. Of the four features produced by David O. Selznick and directed by Alfred Hitchcock Spellbound is probably the one in which suffers most from them treading on each other's toes.Selznick was a rare kind of producer who rather than simply trying to come up with the most successful moneymaking formulas also used his pictures as showcases for his own favourite themes. Spellbound was the result of a passing interest in psychoanalysis and while Hitch was apparently not against the idea of doing a shrink flick Selznick's influence places too much emphasis on it. It's also ridiculously laudatory the foreword and opening scenes giving you the impression that psychoanalysis is as straightforward and effective as prescribing a dose of antibiotics.The structure of Spellbound is also not ideally suited to the Hitchcockian mode of suspense which was based upon revealing the identity of the villain to the audience and then creating tension from making us wonder when and how they will strike again. Sometimes as in Shadow of a Doubt or Rear Window the killer would not be identified with certainty but Hitch would immerse us in the suspicions of the central character and this worked just as well. In some respects it looks as if Spellbound is an example of the latter. There appear to have been some attempts to create suspense out of the possibility that Gregory Peck's character is a murderer and there are some typical Hitchcock moments like the business with the razor that play upon this. The trouble is all those pointofview shots placing us inside Peck's innocent confusion make it impossible for us to accept him as a killer not even one who has forgotten his crimes. As such these tense moments while nicely constructed in themselves have no impact. The final twist when it arrives in the last five minutes seems tacked on and does not shock or satisfy in any way.Spellbound is also an example of why we don't see many outstanding acting performances in Hitchcock movies. It's not just because Hitch didn't give any coaching to his cast members neither did William Wyler and his pictures are always superbly acted it's just that his films are too technical to show off the actors to the best of their abilities. Ingrid Bergman was an exceptional actress but because of the way Hitch works the key moments in her performance are cut up into fleeting reaction shots closeups of hands and so forth. The best impression we get of her acting is in a fairly mundane scene when she is fending off the unwanted attentions of Wallace Ford a moment Hitchcock allows to play out in a midshot unbroken take. Spellbound does contain one of the few Oscarnominated performances in a Hitchcock picture  Michael Chekhov as Dr Brulov. He is not bad although due to the nature of his part he gets the benefit of more conventional shots which capture his best  hence why he got a nod while Ms Bergman didn't.The one Oscar that Spellbound did win was for the Miklos Rozsa score although it's inferior to his work on The Lost Weekend which was also nominated. His music for Spellbound is a little overbearing and is incredibly heavy in the romantic scenes. It's also very sweepingly sentimental which jars somewhat with Hitch's rather aggressive styling of these moments. Still there is some intelligent orchestration and it is rather effective the way it suddenly breaks into a minor key version of the love theme on the theremin when something triggers Peck's memories.In spite of all its flaws Spellbound is still a very watchable picture. The screenplay is by the reliable Ben Hecht and it moves forward at a solid pace. Hitchcock's tothepoint style of direction may not have been flattering to the cast but at least it makes the story clear and easy to digest. However this process of unravelling a mystery does not provide him with opportunities for suspense or at least not his kind of suspense. Selznick got his psycho but this is a mediocre entry for the master.".

	onyx:emotionText "Cinema works best as evenhanded nonegotistical collaboration. Total control by one individual can be hitormiss depending on their proficiency. But what is almost always disastrous is the collision between two dominating personalities. Of the four features produced by David O. Selznick and directed by Alfred Hitchcock Spellbound is probably the one in which suffers most from them treading on each other's toes.Selznick was a rare kind of producer who rather than simply trying to come up with the most successful moneymaking formulas also used his pictures as showcases for his own favourite themes. Spellbound was the result of a passing interest in psychoanalysis and while Hitch was apparently not against the idea of doing a shrink flick Selznick's influence places too much emphasis on it. It's also ridiculously laudatory the foreword and opening scenes giving you the impression that psychoanalysis is as straightforward and effective as prescribing a dose of antibiotics.The structure of Spellbound is also not ideally suited to the Hitchcockian mode of suspense which was based upon revealing the identity of the villain to the audience and then creating tension from making us wonder when and how they will strike again. Sometimes as in Shadow of a Doubt or Rear Window the killer would not be identified with certainty but Hitch would immerse us in the suspicions of the central character and this worked just as well. In some respects it looks as if Spellbound is an example of the latter. There appear to have been some attempts to create suspense out of the possibility that Gregory Peck's character is a murderer and there are some typical Hitchcock moments like the business with the razor that play upon this. The trouble is all those pointofview shots placing us inside Peck's innocent confusion make it impossible for us to accept him as a killer not even one who has forgotten his crimes. As such these tense moments while nicely constructed in themselves have no impact. The final twist when it arrives in the last five minutes seems tacked on and does not shock or satisfy in any way.Spellbound is also an example of why we don't see many outstanding acting performances in Hitchcock movies. It's not just because Hitch didn't give any coaching to his cast members neither did William Wyler and his pictures are always superbly acted it's just that his films are too technical to show off the actors to the best of their abilities. Ingrid Bergman was an exceptional actress but because of the way Hitch works the key moments in her performance are cut up into fleeting reaction shots closeups of hands and so forth. The best impression we get of her acting is in a fairly mundane scene when she is fending off the unwanted attentions of Wallace Ford a moment Hitchcock allows to play out in a midshot unbroken take. Spellbound does contain one of the few Oscarnominated performances in a Hitchcock picture  Michael Chekhov as Dr Brulov. He is not bad although due to the nature of his part he gets the benefit of more conventional shots which capture his best  hence why he got a nod while Ms Bergman didn't.The one Oscar that Spellbound did win was for the Miklos Rozsa score although it's inferior to his work on The Lost Weekend which was also nominated. His music for Spellbound is a little overbearing and is incredibly heavy in the romantic scenes. It's also very sweepingly sentimental which jars somewhat with Hitch's rather aggressive styling of these moments. Still there is some intelligent orchestration and it is rather effective the way it suddenly breaks into a minor key version of the love theme on the theremin when something triggers Peck's memories.In spite of all its flaws Spellbound is still a very watchable picture. The screenplay is by the reliable Ben Hecht and it moves forward at a solid pace. Hitchcock's tothepoint style of direction may not have been flattering to the cast but at least it makes the story clear and easy to digest. However this process of unravelling a mystery does not provide him with opportunities for suspense or at least not his kind of suspense.

There's nothing whatever wrong with fantasy.  Indeed there's nothing better.  Hitchcock announces at the very beginning that the story takes place in a Freudian world thereafter he plays perfectly fair with us.He even chose the right collaborators for a fantasy.  The dream sequences were designed by Salvador Dali.  Anyone whose dreams really do look like Dali paintings maybe COULD do with some psychoanalysis.  They're not frightening  dream sequences rarely are  but they are at any rate more interesting than the usual dreams we might have or hear about.  The music was by Mikls Rzsa maybe the best of the composers who settled in Hollywood certainly the most vividly overpowering.  He was exactly the right choice for this film  however much Hitchcock disliked the score or said that he did.The story follows a confused Gregory Peck who cannot remember key episodes of his recent and not so recent past and who may just possibly be a dangerous criminal.  Ingrid Bergman is a secondgeneration disciple of Freud who despite her professional caution finds herself falling in love with him. Perhaps it sounds cardboard already but the performances invest the characters with more life than my descriptions did.  Peck in particular is highly sympathetic.  He comes across as not at all mad not even mentally disturbed  just a man who can't remember one or two things and has an odd aversion to things like parallel lines.  That?s right  parallel lines. Anyway as I said it's a fantasy the forces of psychoanalysis must unravel the mystery before it's too late.  Why there's a too late is too complicated to go into.  The usual kind of Hitchcock suspense isn't there but the man WAS capable of moving outside his home genre now and then. Remember his other fantasy was The Birds.".

The psychoanalysis against the clock scenario was a bit too tidy but it does work well.  I'm not a big believer of this  world of therapy so some of the scenes stuck in my throat but it was proof of Hitchcock's ability that he managed to make them tense.The example that came to my mind was the film Blackjack by John Woo in which Dolph Lungren is scared of the colour white!  In that movie I was almost in fits of laughter when Lungren is stopped in his tracks by the bad guys spilling lots of milk everywhere!  Here there was no such reaction to Edwards' similar fear.

Some of the imagry is a little obvious doors opening but most is good and the Dali dream sequences are pretty cool.Of course part of this is down to Peck playing just perfect.  Some of his bug eyed reactions to lines etc would have been comical had he not been able to follow through but he did.  It is to his credit that I was kept guessing as to his intentions right through the film.  Bergman is also good but has to carry lines such as I believe him because I could never feel this way for a man with badness in him' I'm paraphrasing the romantic side of the film is harder to carry but she does it well.  Support is good but Leo G Carroll looks very young indeed and took me by surprise when I saw him!Overall I enjoyed this film even though there was so much that could have been a mess.  It is to Hitchcock's credit that he cranks the tension up well and never lets it get silly as it could easily have been in lesser hands. Some of it is a little too easy isn't this deep seated stuff meant to take years rather than days? but this aside it moves swiftly along and is a very interesting way to make a thriller.".

Many of the theories espoused in the movie are complete psychological mumbo jumbo and the behavior of Ingrid Bergman as Peck's therapist would result in her having her license to practice stripped in all 50 states and probably result in criminal prosecution.So what did I like? First though brief I like the dream sequence created by Salvador Dali for the film. It's weird and wacky but cool. I like to show it to my Psychology students for insight into both dream interpretation and the analytic approach to therapy that is no longer in vogue. Second I like the nutty character portrayed by Leo G. Carroll. He's only in the movie here and there but he's malevolent and calculating.Unfortunately despite their amazing talents this movie does nothing to improve the reputations of Peck Bergman or Hitchcock when viewed today. Ingrid Bergman plays a female therapist that hardly seems professional but is instead a hyperemotional and rather silly womanhardly a shining example for women's rights.

	schema:headline " Rather ironic that a film titled Spellbound doesn't keep me spellbound isn't it?";
	schema:reviewBody "I honestly expected to be a little spellbound by Alfred Hitchcock's 1945 mystery Spellbound given that they are some talented talents behind it. I mean this film's got stars Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck and director Alfred Hitchcock behind it. Given that I have reasonably high expectations based on their work I wanted to get into this film for the sake of those people involved. Unfortunately such talented people as these can't save a disappointingly dull film such as Spellbound. In the film we follow a psychiatrist Ingrid Bergman at a mental hospital who is considered by her fellow doctors as one of the best. She and her fellow peers welcome the new director Gregory Peck of the hospital but fairly soon she begins to notice some peculiar aspects about him. She notices that he has a unusual fear of seeing dark parallel lines and a white background together. In addition she eventually finds out that he isn't who he claims to be and that he has a serious case of amnesia. When she also learns that he accidentally committed a murder she tries to cure him of his mental struggles by learning more about his past. I should mention the few aspects of this picture that I found were decent. One thing is that there are a few eyecatching shots that I thought were well executed. There's a shot in which is similar to the type of camera shots you see in today's first person shooter video games where someone is pointing a gun at one of the main leads and we see through their point of view. I thought that shot and similar shots like that were worthy of praising. I also don't find the performances from the leads that bad and I thought they were doing whatever they could to keep the film moving. So what did I think made Spellbound as disappointing as I'm claiming it to be? Well my problem with Spellbound can be summarized as such it's boring beyond belief. Why do I find it boring? I thought the direction seemed to indicate that everything that was happening in the plot was not the slightest bit interesting. The screenplay by Ben Hecht didn't give its characters anything fascinating to talk about and hardly did anything to get us invested in following the plot. This film is basically trying to force us to avoid emotionally attaching to it as much as possible. What's worse is that it succeeds well at doing just that. About 10 to 20 minutes into watching this film that's the point where I completely lost interest in following the narrative since it is told in such a lifeless manner between the boring conversations the characters have and the boring things that are being captured on film. I believe this is definitely one of Alfred Hitchcock's weakest films because of its lack of emotional involvement because of its uninspiring direction because of its lame script and because of the fact that the story that was being told wasn't that good to begin with. Maybe I didn't pick up on something in the main plot maybe I followed it just fine enough either way I expected much more from the talents involved that what I got. Unless you're a hardcore Hitchcock fan and just want to look at it for the sake of seeing all his flicks I'd definitely say there are much better Hitchcock films to check out.".

It's just too slender to sustain a featurelength production and the denouement when it comes is largely routine save for a shocking childhood flashback and could have been explained a lot earlier.

It was inventive for its time though you could say the simile was overwrought.The second startling scene was the accidental fall of the child on the sharp iron barriers of the house was graphic but few remember it. I thought that was great cinema to show the gory end without any blood!The third scene in the film was the attempted pickup of the leading lady by a stranger in the hotel lobby captured by a static camera and the interruption by the hotel detective. This was Ben Hecht and Hitchcock at work providing another magical interlude.The fourth magical moment is the use of color to signify blood briefly after a gun shot in a black and white movie.The fifth magical moment was the envelop lying on the floor seen by the leading lady but not others even as they step on it except for one gentleman.Finally there is the famous Dali painting sequencewhich is remarkably close to DaliBunuel's work in Un Chien Andalou. There is more of the typical Hitchcock in this film wrong man chased by the police The 39 steps Saboteur etc. obsession with food and drinks the meal scene where the leading lady draws an image with a fork and the value of drinking milk at night eschewed by the foxy old psychiatrist. There is sexist humor too Women make the best psychoanalysts until they fall in love after which they become the best patients. This is true of men as well! The film is not the best of Hitchcock but his stamp is all over it. His master move was to cast Ingrid Bergman who is simply a treat to watch and admire in the lead role. Ms Bergman lifted up this movie. So also was the commendable casting of Michael Chekov as the old psychoanalyst. These factors negate the illogical emergency surgery conducted by a team of psychoanalysts and the awful staged ski sequences.".

He cannot stand to see dark lines on a white background.  For example a blanket a robe and a tablecloth.  But he remembers what had happened to him thanks to Constance and her former teacher another psychologist named Dr. Brulov.There is also a wonderful performance by Leo G. Carroll who plays Dr. Murchison.  He has also been one of my favorite actors and he's brilliant in this movie.So the bottom line is you should really see this movie and not just for Gregory Peck's handsome face or Ingrid Bergman's beauty.  I think it's one of Hitch's best suspense movies.  By the way Gregory Peck does look very very handsome in this movie so for those girls out there who still think you might not want to see it it's worth it!".

This was only my second time viewing this and the first time in God knows how many years but I really loved every single second of the film so there's no question I'll be watching it a lot more in upcoming years. I thought the film had a high level of suspense running from start to finish with the usual great style from Hitchcock. the brilliant music score also helps things wonderfully especially during the highly intense ski scene. Both Bergman and Peck are terrific together and they really sell the story and make us care about the two characters. As great as those two our the film belongs to Michael Chekhov who adds great comic support. The love scene was also highly passionate and the dream sequence packs a nice punch as well. The crowd I watched this with seemed to be really involved like I was as there were all sorts of little tense noises as you could hear people gasping and holding their breathe.".

With that being said I think this film is a lot more entertaining to watch since it's just 17minutes. What we've basically got here are clips of the German soldiers doing their daily routine but it's the masterful camerawork that really sells the film. I really loved how Riefenstahl shot the movie with the camera down low looking up towards people and making them appear much bigger. The way the sun is high above them beating down just added a surreal touch.Of course it's impossible to watch this film without looking at these soldiers and wondering what horrors they committed during WWII. You can't help but think which one of them were killed in battle. Which one of them worked at the camps where millions of Jews were killed. The ugliness hangs its head all over the film.".

It is a blackandwhite movie that runs for slightly under half an hour and for the most part shows us the German armed forces in fake combat action and during parades. Of course during these parades all the highrank Nazi politicians are there as well not just Hitler himself.It is not a particularly interesting movie to watch really only significant to see how things were back then from a documentary perspective. Quality is fairly low even for the 1930s. The film's director is centenarian Leni Riefenstahl who did some more Nazi propaganda movies such as the infamous Triumph of the Will. There is quite some irony between the music and the scenes depicted. Especially the whistling parts make it seem fairly ridiculous at times. All in all only worth a watch for those with a deep interest in German history of the 20th century.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1982 Steven Spielberg pulled off an incredible feat.  In June of that year Spielberg released two films only weeks apart that were both highly successful yet diversely different in both subject matter and their target audiences.  One went on to become the highest grossing film of alltime E.T. the other spawned a franchise Poltergeist.  Poltergeist had a screen credit of being directed by Tobe Hooper The Texas Chainsaw Massacre but history has revealed that it was Spielberg's vision editing and overall command of the shooting that was really behind the making of this extraordinary film.   Poltergeist brought back the traditional haunted house genre that lay dormant and restless since The Amityville Horror in 1979.  The story surrounds a family's house that has been punctured by the spirit world that seem keen on the youngest daughter of the clan  Carol Ann Freeling played by newcomer Heather O'Rourke.  At first the family meets the strange happenings in the home with playful pleasure but in an instant the poltergeists intentions turn against the Freelings and their daughter is captured and taken back to the supernatural world where communication is possible only through the bedroom television.The Freelings waste little time and soon contact a paranormal group well over their heads to help them rescue their daughter from the unseen captures.  It becomes clearly evident however that the group is over matched and they call in a poltergeist expert Tangina Barrons played with relative enthusiasm and wit by Zelda Rubinstein to assist with the phenomena.   Tangina then leads the Freelings through the unknown both calming their fears and eventually finding a portal that may be the key to retrieving their daughter.Poltergeist works as both a horror and a thriller.  The cast lead by O'Rourke JoBeth Williams Craig T. Nelson and Oliver Robins have real chemistry and are believable as a family unit and unlike most horror films they make sound judgments and know their limitations.  When Carol Ann's bedroom becomes overtaken by the ghostly spirits they lock the room and keep away rather than trying to fight something they cannot contain.  And when things begin to look bleak they call for help and look for experts in the field.  This is an intelligent horror that doesn't have people running up the stairs when they should be running out the door.Put together with a modest budget of less than 12 million Poltergeist stretched it's dollars to provide us with an incredible array of special effects that still hold up well after 20 years of viewing.  Sure the scene where a scientist literally pulls his face off or when the bedroom is opened and we see items flying at random as if in a ghostly tornado might be better served with CGI if made today the effects still keep the story progressing with a sense of credibility.  Probably what keeps things so rooted in acceptability is how simplistic some of the special effects were in the larger scenes.  A closet full of strobe lights are all that is required to convince us that it is a portal to another world and a fan gently blowing the hair of mother Williams' is believable as the spirit of her child flying past her.    Simple plausible.Whatever the reasons Poltergeist works.  One of the few screenplays written by Spielberg from one of his own stories Poltergeist has all the elements that we now associate with the master director.  There is a strong family unit a child as the central character above average production values and most notably not one fatality in the entire film despite all the jilts and jolts.  The closing scenes of chaos including a pool of skeletons later revealed to be authentic is pure movie magic with frantic pacing and edge of your seat suspense.  Since it's release a lot has been made of the back stories and the curse surrounding the production of the franchise.  Heather O'Rourke tragically died at a young age due to an internal infection and Dominique Dunne who played a smaller role as her sister was murdered the same year as the films release.  The subsequent sequels have also included characters that died shortly after their films completion. Truth or fiction lore or legend these stories add to the mystique and mystery surrounding the film.  Having knowledge of the curse' makes it even scarier and gives it kind of a feeling like Naomi Watts' character must have experienced in The Ring as if just by watching you are contributing to the ongoing haunting.Like most movies successful in the late 70's early 80's there were sequels that were made with considerably higher budgets but less than stellar results Superman III anyone?.  Neither of the Poltergeist sequels or subsequent television programming could come close to capturing the essence of the original.  Besides how can you top what is now one of the most famous movie taglines of all time They'rrreeee Here'?Strong recommendation.".

You get Poltergeist a top of the pick no holds barred roller coaster ride through the supernatural world and back to ours. Poltergeist explores the side affects of a haunted house and it's effects on a normal suburban family who inhabits the house. Steve Freeling is a successful realestate agent who has a nice house and a loving wife with a family to die for. There is the spunky rebellious eldest daughter as portrayed gloriously by the late Dominique Dunne may she rest in peace. The sporty young son and the cute innocent youngest daughter Carol Ann of whom the story is based around. The Freelings' are a happy American family whose lives are turned upside down when they realize their house in 'haunted' and the 'poltergeists' kidnap the youngest member of the family. In the film that pursues Steve and his wife Diane do everything in their power to get her back with the aid of Dr. Lesh played out Oscar worthy by Beatrice Straight and her assistants. Horrors and traumas ensue.Enough power to knock you out of your dreams for long time this film was said to be directed by Tobe Hooper whom had previous fame with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. But when one watches this film it is anything but Hooper. Hooper's trademarks include hysteria and screaming by a young female in the finale of his filmsremember 'Eaten Alive?' and have no real substance or depth in their plots what you see is what you get. Whereas this film said to be produced by Spielberg was so obviously directedon the side anywayby also as his trade marks include psychological P.O.V. shotsDiane Freeling in the hallway scene and wide range of character developmentall characters except for Dana are developed to fruition but Dunne does such a great job as Dana that you can't really tell.There was even controversy over who directed the film and still stands so today although Spielberg came forward a little after the film was released and exposed himself as only producer and assistant to the director still rumor is still hovering over the memory of the production.The music to the film is superb with Goldsmith clearly at one of his best moments nominated but did not win although he should have. His theme for the Freelings' is a calm gentle one that compliments his theme for Carol Ann which is quite possibly one of the prettiest themes he ever concocted. His score for the ghosts consists of structured spiritual themes and rough orchestral brass woodwind accompanied by a grand chorus. All other themes he came up with were just as stand outish as the above mentioned.The acting is top notch by conflicted Steve Freeling who is so confused he self destructs into a pale maelstrom in his mind and Diane the mother and star of the film Jobeth Williams is at her finest as she deals with the stress of trying to find her daughter and keeping her family afloat amidst the chaos. The children are all really good under Hooper'sSpielberg's? direction particularly Dominique Dunne who shines through in all scenes she is in even though her character has got to be the most underdeveloped! Robbie is fun to watch as all little boys will be boys. And who could forget the cute CarolAnn...They're Heeeeere! Enough said. But my personal favorite was the late Beatrice Straight as the sympathetic Dr. Lesh who with every facial expression the audience can see what exactly she is thinking about to say and still manages to surprise the audience with her spontaneous acting skill. The supporting cast are just as great.Special effects make this even more of a thrill ride of the ages as Industrial Light and Magic was first starting out and makes this one of the biggest special effects fest of cinema. Nominations for those also.So in full circle this family this film the most extraordinary horror film of the eighties still has the power to ring every chill out of it's script while still managing to keep the audience calm with it's realism and relief.And about the curse that is said to follow the series' past all just tragedies and coincidence.May Dominique Dunne Beatrice Straight Heather O' Rourke Jerry Goldsmith all rest in peace.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "I noticed that IMDb lists the release dates for films and laughed here because I could never forget Friday June 4 1982 my last day in tenth grade and about my tenth date with the exceptionally pretty and wonderful young lady I dated throughout most of high school. The weather was perfect and I took my ladyfriend out for a nice lunch and a walk down Broadway in search of a movie. ET had been the hyped Spielberg film of that summer but this one was already out and the thought of a horrified hottie clinging to me for dear life or vice versa was irresistible. Poltergeist it was.Like all Spielberg films one will not find many weaknesses. The plot will be engaging the visuals stunning the acting excellent and the overall experience firstclass. This film did not disappoint.The restrospectively amusing casting of Craig T. Nelson in the lead. Notable supporting cast include the late Dominique Dunne and the late Healther O'Rourke both of whom would die tragically in 1988 and 1982 respectively the earlier by domestic violence and the latter by illness.

	onyx:emotionText "I noticed that IMDb lists the release dates for films and laughed here because I could never forget Friday June 4 1982 my last day in tenth grade and about my tenth date with the exceptionally pretty and wonderful young lady I dated throughout most of high school. The weather was perfect and I took my ladyfriend out for a nice lunch and a walk down Broadway in search of a movie. ET had been the hyped Spielberg film of that summer but this one was already out and the thought of a horrified hottie clinging to me for dear life or vice versa was irresistible. Poltergeist it was.Like all Spielberg films one will not find many weaknesses. The plot will be engaging the visuals stunning the acting excellent and the overall experience firstclass. This film did not disappoint.The restrospectively amusing casting of Craig T. Nelson in the lead. Notable supporting cast include the late Dominique Dunne and the late Healther O'Rourke both of whom would die tragically in 1988 and 1982 respectively the earlier by domestic violence and the latter by illness.

	schema:reviewBody "Poltergeist is Steven Spielberg's vision of a ghost story and a great one at that. This is an outstanding movie in every way possible. It has terrific acting a good story to tell a nice sense of humor and astonishing special effects. Plus when I first saw this film it was pretty scary.Poltergeist tells the story of a suburban family living in a small town in California who's home is abruptly invaded by supernatural forces who are anything but friendly and proceed to terrorize the entire clan. This is a movie that plays like a rollercoaster ride and once it gets going it never stops. Tobe Hooper who directed the original 1974 cult classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was picked by Spielberg to direct Poltergeist. He does a fine job of creating scares and tension even though rumors were floating around that writerproducer Spielberg actually stepped in and directed some of the film Spielberg went on to say that Hooper was the director of Poltergeist even though Spielberg was very much involved with this film from start to finish. To me it doesn't matter who directed it. This is still an excellent horror movie. Spielberg did a great job as writerproducer and even if he had directed the whole movie it would still be as good. JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson are wonderful as the head of the Freeling family with Dominique Dunne Oliver Robins and Heather O'Rourke equally good as their kids. The late Oscarwinning actress Beatrice Straight Network scores points as a parapsycologist investigating the hauntings and Zelda Rubinstein steals scenes as the mysterious clairvoyant brought in to clean house. The acting is great but it's the Oscarnominated special effects that dominate. Wow! This horror film is a mustsee! out of five".

Now paranormalists led by Beatrice Straight must come in and try to get O'Rourke back to her family. Tobe Hooper who is best known for the highly overrated Texas Chainsaw Massacre does an admirable job here with the film's direction. However it is rumored that Steven Spielberg came in during his E.T days and did the bulk of the work. This makes more sense as the film is really frightening and disturbing. The special effects are also impressive and Poltergeist ends up being one of those films that just sticks with you for a long time after you first see it. 4 stars out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "Poltergeist is a tremendously overrated movie. I watched it again the other day for the first time in 20 years and had the exact same reaction as the first time. The plot simply doesn't hold together.There are too many elements introduced in the story or hinted at and many of them are never explained properly or paid off later. It's classic mediocre scriptwriting. Steven Spielberg is a terrific director but a middling writer. He wrote this story about some of his childhood fears and recollections and the movie plays like a disjointed series of set pieces which are only partially related by a poorly thoughtout framing story.First it's about unsettled ghosts. Then it's hinted in one scene that Satan is involved somehow. This and how it relates to the ghosts is never explained. Then corpses start breaking through the ground. So why now some 67 years after the house was built over the graves? Where have all these spirits been for 7 years?? Again this is never explained. And why only in this one house if the whole subdivision was built over the graves? And what's the deal with the tree that grabs the son and tries to devour him? Can anyone tell me what the hell this has to do with the rest of the story as it plays out because I sure can't! Just another action set piece.And in classic bad script fashion the characters suddenly start acting clueless in order to further the action. After all that's just happened the family decides to spend one more night in the house and the mother lets her children sleep in the same room which was the center of all the evil?? OH PLEASE! Even Tobe Hooper's direction is slow and plodding and many of the scenes just don't pack the wallop they should. IMDb states that Spielberg held Hooper back so this may not have been his fault but it's still a problem with this movie.I'm sorry if these complaints seem nitpicky but I don't think they are. Any good movie including a good horror one needs to be coherent and have things make sense and be understandable. Poltergeist simply has too many irons in the fire and it comes off as disjointed and unsatisfying.".

The script is so well written the acting heartfelt and wonderful and the direction and production techniques are topnotch.

	schema:reviewBody "Considering that a good portion of the film Poltergeist was acted out by children 5year old Carol Anne Heather O'Rourke and 8year old Robbie Oliver Robins and still say that it was a great acted movie might sound strange.  But it was.  In my opinion O'Rourke was the best child actress of the 80s if not in history.  Robins although he never became largelyknown did a surprisingly fantastic job in Poltergeist.  Also 18year old Dana Dominique Dunne the parents JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson and the psychics were also just as good. Considering that none of the actors in this movie ever became large stars with the possible exception of NelsonAlso the rest of the movie was great.  The special FX were adequate for 1982 the plot was interesting and Poltergeist unlike Nightmare on Elm Street Friday the Thirteenth et cetera did not rely on blood and gore. In fact those stupid slasher movies will never have the same singular effect as did Poltergeist.  And if anything it was underrated.  Have you ever seen Poltergeist on any 'top 100' movies or referred to very often? Poltergeist should get the respect it deserves like The Exorcist.  It should be rereleased into theatres in 2002 the 20year anniversary.I shall not give away the storyline for those of you who have not seen the movie but if you haven't rent it.  It is simply wonderful.  It is the first and only real ghost story.".

At this point you may be thinking this guy just doesn't like the genre. Not true but in my opinion effective truly scary horror is created by the maxim less is more  not the more is more approach that Spielberg has employed successfully in other films and less well here. A disappointment go watch Ring instead for truly creepy television antics.One last thing it's appalling this got a PG in the US. One particularly disgusting scene involving peeling flesh is clearly unsuitable for kids and I can imagine this giving young children nightmares as hokey as it is.

This was the first big budget film to really tackle the subject of paranormal investigation and at the time it was made it was seamless and sleek. It would be easy for people today to put it down for some of the early 1980's effects but let's flip this perspective around and consider that no CGI whatsoever was used. But at the same time Poltergeist has a strangely familyfriendly vibe. It was directed by Tobe Hooper but it has the unmistakable fingerprints of producerwriter Steven Spielberg all over it. It focuses on an ordinary harmless suburban family living their usual lives their biggest problem is the death of a pet bird which is suddenly thrown into chaos by outside forces. And unlike most horror movies there isn't even a lot of violence... well except for one grotesque hallucination.Don't expect the usual gore and typical shocks you see in all modern horror films these days Poltergeist is not about that. With all of the elements of visual effects sound acting directing Tobe Hooper and writers Steven Spielberg this is one film that achieves everything you want to see in a motion picture. Anyway Jo Beth Williams and Craig T. Nelson are great in this film. They have real chemistry. You believe they love each other and are a team. The kids are pretty great too. It's actually quite a thoughtful movie and even has an odd warmth to it. Though there are a few scary moments. The final fifteen minutes are played out to such effect that one could call it pure horror.Overall rating 7 out of 10.".

But the poltergeists in this movie go far beyond that. Directed by Tobe Hooper and produced by Steven Speilberg Poltergeist is in my opinion one of the scariest movies of all time. The plotline is very original written by Speilberg on how nasty ghosts invade a family home kidnap the 5yearold daughter and bring her to the other side and her parents must battle the ghosts to get her back. Although filmed in 1982 the special effects in Poltergeist are very astounding and are done very well my favorite being the beast esophagus which manifests grusomely in the children's bedroom closet. Some people who have seen the movie still have nightmares about it two decades later esspecially the incidents with the malevolent clown doll and the swimming pool. Poltergeist is definately worth watching for those in neat of excitement.10 Stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some films really take you on a ghost train ride and this film does it with style. This is obviously the main reason for watching it. The other reason for watching is that it so much more than just a ghost train ride. This film is actually beautiful. From Jerry Goldsmiths wonderful score I.L.M's SFX still looking good after thirty years and still better than some things out now. Mathew F Leonetti's photography and last but not least the cast especially JoBeth Williams Craig T Nelson and Beatrice Straight. These actors prove themselves as dramatists and make us believe what we see.In my humble opinion they all do a great job of bringing the drama. For me these are the reasons to watch this film again and again. This film brings to life the horror comic book story's I loved as a kid like Tales from the Grave and The Nightcomers. Unlike a lot of tales of the supernatural on film latelyit is not spending an hour watching a door open slightly due to perhaps an unseen presence or maybe subsidence. This is seeing the door being ripped off its hinges by a force that has dropped the veil and allowed us to glimpse the howling twisted monster that awaits us on the other side and all in Metrocolor. Rather than a remote old mansion in an over gloomy setting we are placed within the sunkissed California hills in a valley under a cobalt blue sky with an ordinary family whose youngest child Carol Anne becomes the conduit for the souls of the dead propelled by a terrible evil enabling them to escape the world of the dead and break through roaring laughing and screaming into the world of the living with CarolAnne exclaiming Their heeeeeere!!!. Craig T Nelson is just superb as Steven Freeling being the maninthesketch and JoBeth Williams as the enthusiastic mother and brave matriarch is just fantastic. The whole movie has a Steven King quality and style to it with the slow build reaching to a draw dropping finale.All of it laced with humor and some scenes played for laughs which are very funny. I do believe that this is a classic film and a must see. For methe film delivered everything I ever wanted from a story of the supernatural.If you haven't seen it yet then get it! Then get the beers inthe chips n dips turn down the lights and enjoy. Rob H".

	schema:headline " Poltergeist  Horror for middleclass America";
	schema:reviewBody "They're here and they're ready to stay.1982's Poltergeist is widely regarded as one of the greatest horror films of the last 35 years and certainly one of the most popular and widely imitated. I've caught Poltergeist many times over the years but I have never actually sat down and watched the whole thing in its entirety. It's a gripping film with a great cast great story high production values and great direction.Poltergeist is one of those great cinematic collaborations that everyone dreams about it was directed by horror veteran Tobe Hooper of 1974's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre but it was produced and cowritten by Hollywood director Steven Spielberg Jaws Close Encounters of the Third Kind Raiders of the Lost Ark. I've read that there's been some debate over who was the true director here  Hooper or Spielberg  but there's no denying that the film bears the marks of both of its principal creators Hooper's unique ability to shock the viewer and make people physically ill with what they're watching and Spielberg's eye for human drama and groundbreaking special effects courtesy of George Lucas's Industrial Light  Magic  ILM.Poltergeist involves an American middleclass suburban family's battle with malevolent spirits. But this film was like no other hauntedhouse movie before it. While films concerning themselves with evil spirits haunting human protagonists in isolated locations like large foreboding castles and mansions or small cabins in the deep forest are all too common in the horror genre Poltergeist brought that very same ghost story to middleclass America  forcing the film's protagonists and the audience to confront a supernatural horror right in their own homes. You can probably read all sorts of sociopolitical subtexts in this story  like the idea of how people escape to the suburbs to free themselves of the dangers prevalent in the bigger cities only to find themselves the victims of something far more dangerous than anything there in this case ghosts or poltergeists.We're introduced to the Freeling family who live in the picturesque suburban Southern California community of Cuesta Verde. There's Steven Freeling Craig T. Nelson his wife Diane JoBeth Williams their oldest daughter Dana the late Dominique Dunne who was murdered by her boyfriend a few months after this film's release Robbie Oliver Robins and Carol Anne the late Heather O'Rourke who tragically passed away six years later from septic shock caused by intestinal stenosis while filming this movie's second of two sequels.Like William Friedkin had done on The Exorcist 1973 Hooper takes his time in introducing us to the Freelings so that we get to know each of them as people and see them going about their daily lives. But soon strange occurrences begin happening around the house. At first they're benign even if understandably unsettling. Eating utensils appear bent out of shape. Chairs move by themselves. And Carol Anne can hear voices talking to her through their living room television set.This strange phenomena soon starts to turn terrifying and violent. Robbie is nearly eaten alive by the old tree outside his bedroom window. And tragically Carol Anne is abducted by the ominous forces that seemed to have taken up residence in the Freeling's house and dragged her off to the spirit realm. Steven and Diane waste little time in contacting professionals  in this case university parapsychologist Dr. Lesh the late Beatrice Straight who regards her profession as one with little reward but who soon sees that what the Freelings are dealing with is the real deal and Tangina Zelda Rubinstein a medium who explains to everyone that the Freeling house is haunted by a malevolent supernatural entity known only as The Beast that is holding Carol Anne hostage on the other side.Poltergeist is a bold marriage of talent and special effects. For a film that was released 34 years ago as of this writing its practical special effects still stand up to the test of time and beat out many of its more modernday CGIladen counterparts. Only someone as gifted as Steven Spielberg and Lucas's ILM could have been capable of doing this.Poltergeist is one of the great modern ghost stories. The unique collaboration of director Tobe Hooper and producercoscreenwriter Steven Spielberg is one of the great collaborative efforts in the history of film.1010".

Without putting too fine a point on it or preaching Poltergeist critiques relentless consequencefree Reaganera American optimism in which past sins and omissions can be ignored and replicated because Profit!! until the overlooked decide they've had enough. The movie only leaves the tickytacky sunny and stormy suburban setting for two brief scenes which helps it build a blandly claustrophobic atmosphere. Cuesta Verde is a place where as one minor character observes the houses all look alike where people are so packed in that your neighbor's remote can change your TV channel and where the phased planning aims to corral past present and future residents in a manner that extracts maximum value. A lot of factors have helped enshrine Poltergeist as a modern classic from the backandforth exhortations about going into the light or not! to Zelda Rubenstein's memorable turn as a psychic to the sad tale of Heather O'Rourke who utters the film's most famous line They're here... but beyond all that it remains as gripping entertaining and watchable as it was when it debuted. And for those of us of a certain age it provides a reminder that networks used to go off the air and that sometimes the best idea is to turn off the TV.".

During production one of his actresses almost died whilst filming a hanging scene ever since Kim was traumatized and on top of that he now had writer's block. After three years of living in exile away from the film industry he decided to pick up a camera again not only because filmmaking is his one true love but to help him approach understand and overcome his traumatic experience during the filming of his last film as well as get back into doing what he loves the most. But what would he film for he has no material? Instead Kim decided to aim the camera at himself delving deep into his own mind to understand his own values. This film is composed mainly of close up shots of Kim speaking back and forth with himself he speaks on a variety of subjects from his filmography to the neardeath experience of the actress on the set of Dream and all the while throughout every word he speaks you can see his thought process wandering gaining momentum. The audience follow his train of thought as he follows it himself  he sings the titular song of Arirang to himself over and over again without letting on it's meaning or it's significance but the beauty of Kim's work is undoubtedly his ambiguity and this continues that theme. At two moments in the film there's a knock at Kim's door but each time he opens up there's no one there. A metaphor perhaps for Kim searching for something but being met with just pent up frustration and a lack of understanding. As the film draws to it's close Kim picks up a gun and starts shooting people or is he? This is labelled as a documentary  but it's partdocumentary and partdrama and it plays out almost like a video diary but whatever it can be labelled as Arirang is an incredibly haunting film about a man trapped inside his own head trying to get out and regardless of how Kim treats his own work and his own mind he is still a true visionary with a lot more to say. I was already a huge fan of KiDuk Kim's work prior to seeing this and now I once again eagerly anticipate his next film.httpdestroyallcinema.wordpress.com".

As with most of his work Kim KiDuk is not into mass market Hollywood style.Watching this piece is like an inspection of a selfportrait of Rembrandt or van Gogh. The artist goes into seclusion. He takes a long hard look in the mirror preens himself then strips away his id bit by bit. He examines the parts in minutiae bewildered. He wails as he could not make any sense of it. He creates an alter ego a shadow. He cross examines himself playing both the cool detachment as well as the devil's advocate. In between he consoles himself by singing the Korean folk song Arirang as a wolf would bray at the full moon. During his lucid moments he is the calm director  editor in postproduction. He checks each take critically wondering how he can put it back together into a singular entity again. Bit by bit splice by splice over three years he came out with this movie.Like any selfportrait this movie does not show Kim Kiduk the entire person. It is just a fleeting capture of the artist at that moment as a Picasso in his Blue Period is not a summation of Picasso the person.A portrait has no meaning relevance if you have not seen any of the artist's endeavours. But once you have been touched by their struggle curiosity will be pipped. Why did he do the things he does? Where did he gets it? How did he do it?After many soul searching encounters with the numerous self portraits of Rembrandt and van Gogh I now look forward to another Arirang moment with Kim Kiduk. It may not be pleasant but I am sure it will be an experience.".

On Christmas Eve Scott reads The Night Before Christmas... then receives an unexpected visitor on his roof. When he's startled by Scott's calling out and falls the Santa impersonator disappears leaving only an 8reindeer sleigh and a suit with instructions to put it on if he's involved in an accident. Scott does and is transported around the town dropping gifts through chimneys until he's taken to the North Pole and informed by a group who claim they're elves that he is now Santa. Charlie is proud of his dad's new job though Scott's convinced it's a dream. Until his hair turns white his beard refuses to stay shaved he gains weight inexplicably even for his sudden love of junk food... Now he's accepted it there's just one problem how to keep it secret from his disbelieving family?";

It's an original '90s style Christmas story that tugs at your heart strings and reminds you that we were all kids once. It reminds you of those days when you dreamt of Santa... when you stood in line waiting to sit on the jolly elf's lap... your knees shaking... as you tried to memorize what you were going to ask Santa. Anyone who isn't touched by this movie should look for the little boy or girl inside and remember the Christmas Eves when you listened for the clatter of reindeer hooves on the roof.

	schema:headline " Tim Allen As...Huh?";
	schema:reviewBody "Ever wonder who is Santa Claus really?  Where does he come from how old is he?  How in the world does he squeeze down a chimney and how does he get in if there isn't a chimney?  What's the deal here?  Well happily the answers to these questions and more are finally answered as the legend of Santa Claus comes to life as never before in The Santa Clause' directed by John Pasquin and starring Tim Allen.  Scott Calvin Allen is an executive with a toy manufacturing company he's divorced and has a young son Charlie Eric Lloyd who still believes in Santa but is at an age at which doubt is beginning to creep into the picture.  And the fact that Charlie's mom Laura Wendy Crewson has a boyfriend Dr. Neal Miller Judge Reinhold who is a psychiatrist isn't helping the situation any.  Neal it seems is adamant about counseling Charlie in the realities of life which of course includes the real scoop on Santa which doesn't go over too well with Scott. Then on Christmas Eve which Charlie is spending with Scott a strange thing happens.  There's a clatter on the roof and Scott rushes outside to investigate where he discovers a man in a red suit clamoring about on the roof of his twostory house.  As Scott watches the man loses his footing and falls into the snow on the front lawn.  And to Scott's amazement it's Santa Claus!  Or at least a guy dressed up like Santa and he's not in very good shape at the moment.  Lying there on his back the man hands Scott a card with instructions written on it about what to do in this particular situation.  Put on the suit' it says The reindeer will know what to do.' And when Scott looks back up at the roof what he sees concludes what Neal would probably call an SEE Significant Emotional Experience and though he doesn't realize it at the moment his life is about to change forever...And with that Pasquin goes on to tell the story of Scott Calvin's amazing odyssey which puts a humorous and at times poignant spin on this contemporary and highly imaginative rendition of the Santa Claus story which offers much more than merely a fresh face on an old tale.  The Santa angle has that universal appeal that will attract viewers initially but what makes this story really accessible is the reality which lies beneath the fantasy.  The relationships examined in this film the whole situation with Scott Charlie Laura and Neal are quite common in our modern world and that obstacle in the lives of these characters puts a necessary balance in the story that makes it more than just another Christmas fantasy.  It puts an edge on the sentimentality that would've been overthetop had Scott for example been a happily married man with a text book family life. That would've been good for maybe a one hour T.V. special on a Tuesday night whereas this story and the way it's presented is unique and lends itself well to full length motion picture status.When you think of Tim Allen you don't necessarily think in terms of Santa Claus his Tim Taylor Home Improvement' persona is simply too farreaching there are in fact some in' jokes sprinkled subtly throughout this film like when Scott in Santa's workshop picks up a toy tool belt and holds it up to himself but it actually becomes a positive here and another part of the appeal of this film.  it establishes Scott as a real person an average guy attempting to cope with the everyday problems of everyday life.  And it keeps the core of the story grounded which ultimately makes the fantasy work while giving it heart.  So in retrospect Allen was a perfect choice for the role of Scott Calvin and in the long run this just may turn out to be one of his most memorable roles which is somewhat ironic as this was Allen's big screen debut because this is certainly the kind of film that is bound to make a lot of people's annual holiday movies to watch' list falling into that category of films you can watch over and over again every Christmas season like A Christmas Story.' Christmas Vacation' A Christmas Carol' and It's A Wonderful Life.'  All films which though certainly diverse have at their center the spirit of Christmas along with family values and traditions and all told in a way that enables the viewer to readily identify with the characters and the story which is exactly what this film does.Eric Lloyd turns in a good performance as Charlie making his character believable while keeping him positive despite the conflicts which surround him and Crewson and Reinhold are solid in their respective roles as well. But in supporting roles the standout performances come from David Krumholtz as Bernard Santa's Head Elf and Paige Tamada who is endearing as Judy the Little Elf.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Peter Boyle Mr. Whittle Mary Gross Miss Daniels Larry Brandenburg Detective Nunzio Judith Scott Susan Jayne Eastwood Judy the Waitress and Joyce Guy Principal Compton.  An entertaining and ultimately uplifting movie The Santa Clause' is funny and enjoyable and has a lot to offer in the way of family entertainment the kind of film adults and kids alike are going to appreciate.  And it may even make you believe in some things you hadn't even considered before but that's for you to figure out as you watch the movie.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 810.".

Tim Allen was perfect to play the dad who becomes Santa and I love when he burned the roast! I also thought the actor who played Bernard the elf was very funny and stole every scene he was in.

The plot is original the script is fun and the pace is surprisingly even. Don't expect a classic like Scrooge1951 the first 2 Home Alone movies or It's a Wonderful Life just expect a pleasant family Christmas film that way the whole family is in for a good time. The film is directed with careful precision and the characters are likable though I did find the parents a tad too clichd and the film a tad too overly sentimental in places. If I had a favourite character I think it was Judy there was something about her truly infectious smile that made me warm to her. All in all well above average and highly recommended. 810 Bethany Cox".

Scott thinks he's dreaming but over the next several months he gains weight and grows an inexplicably white beard.

Something akin to A Christmas Story one of my alltime favorites but one I've seen too many times. I needed a new Christmas movie and The Santa Claus seemed like a promising candidate. Wrong.Tim Allen plays Scott Calvin a workaholic divorced parent who cannot connect with his young son. And he desperately wants to both for his son and to offset the influence of Mom's new boyfriend. But Scott can't do anything right. Then on Christmas Eve Scott accidentally kills Santa Clause. Funny huh? The clause in the title is not a misspelling but refers to the legal clause that requires anyone who offs Santa to take his place. This is cleverly done although it is a bit maudlin. Well guess what happens? Scott learns the nonreligious meaning of Christmas bonds with his son discovers himselfmake that a lot maudlin. In 1994 Tim Allen was riding high with his hit TV show Home Improvement and in The Santa Clause he plays Tim Allen playing Tim Allen playing Santa Clause. No stretch here. And the rest of the cast is just there as a foil for Tim. And the plot however clever just wasn't very entertaining to this reviewer. Actually this minority commentator didn't like The Santa Clause very much at all and certainly can't recommend it to anyone.".

So ensues a calamitous misadventurous night for Scott Calvin and his innocuous son Charlie of delivering presents all around the world with exhaustion only to conclude the evening at the North Pole full of curious and inquisitive little elves who serve Scott and Charlie chocolate milk dress them in royal pajamas and stress that if Scott does not assume the role of Santa then children throughout the world will be devastated. It can't be easy being the man in the red suit especially when your personality doesn't satisfy the duties required. From Christmas Eve on Scott Calvin experiences a marvelous transformation from his appearance and appetite to his tendencies and even language to become a suitable Santa Claus by the following Thanksgiving while being scoffed and threatened by the outside party e.g. his former wife's fiance a psychiatrist frequently offers him therapy. For the most part The Santa Clause is an endearing delightful and fruitful family comedy. There are some significant flaws however such as the tone frequently going from jolly and refreshing to depressing and melancholy from the realms of the North Pole to the doldrums of the adulterated society. This kind of deviation is perhaps too serious and even discouraging for an innocuous Christmas comedy and why would everyone who disbelieved in Santa Claus be so inclined to destroy Scott Calvin for his harmless spirit and whim? Fortunately by the end it seems everyone has developed a newfound spirit towards Christmas and Santa Claus through the convenience of witnessing Santa riding to the North Pole and all is ended well A merry Christmas to all and to all a great night! This is a mostly enjoyable Christmas comedy that is heartwarming funny and endearing and definitely worth catching around the holidays.

Basically Scott Calvin Tim Allen has been divorced from exwife Laura Wendy Crewson for some time now and though she is married to a slightly annoying Dr. Neil Miller Beverly Hills Cop's Judge Reinhold he still has access to his six year old son Charlie Eric Lloyd. Still a big believer of Santa Claus Scott doesn't want to upset Charlie and on Christmas Eve there is an unexpected visitor and shouting up to the man in the red suit Scott unintentionally causes him to fall off. Charlie comes outside and sees that his Dad has seemingly killed Santa Claus a supposed identity card confirms who he is and there is a note saying that he should put on the coat and take over the sleigh and reindeer. So with Charlie urging him on Scott does indeed put on the red coat and is taken from house to drop off the hundreds of presents to houses far and wide. Eventually the delivering is over and they are taken to the North Pole and the workshop of many elves who admittedly look like children but are working very hard for next year. Lead elf Bernard David Krumholtz tells him that because he put on the red coat he is now taking over all responsibilities this is the Santa Clause a law contract or regulation you would get one with a divorce and he is now the new Santa Claus. So not long after returning home for the remaining year before December approaches Charlie is still insisting to everyone that his father is Santa Claus while Scott develops the big guy attributes such as the white hair a beard that won't go away and a big gut that won't be slimmed. Eventually he has truly become Santa Claus and there is nothing he can do about it so he accepts his responsibility and returns to the North Pole ready to steer the sleigh and reindeer. There is a point when Laura and Neil tried to stop Scott seeing Charlie and the police get involved with finding Santa Clais but in the end everything settles. Also starring Larry Brandenburg as Det. Nunzio Mary Gross as Miss Daniels Paige Tamada as Judy the Elf Peter Boyle as Mr. Whittle and Judith Scott as Susan Perry. I didn't realise this was the first feature film Allen starred in a good debut as a Scrooge like working father with quite a few sarcastic comments and it of course led him to become the voice of Toy Story's Buzz Lightyear. The story is filled with some clever Christmassy reference many funny slapstick and sentimental moments you've come to expect from Disney all in all a fun for all the family seasonal fantasy comedy.

There just kids let them believe there is a Santa clause It gives them something to look forward to. Everyone is always trying to get kids to grow up faster. Let them enjoy there childhood they only get one. I personally though the movie was awesome and I know my kids really enjoyed it. I thought Tim Allen did a horrendous job in play jolly ol' saint nick. The effects were awesomeconsidering time movie was madewith getting the reindeer and the chimney effects etc...It was a great movie and everyone needs to quit crushing children's dreams. Thats why there's violence in schools.";

Tim Allen is a horrible actor who only knows one speed he's definitely not versatile and every sentimental scene in the movie seems false and forced.

	schema:reviewBody "I know what you're thinking. What?! You're giving The Santa Clause a bad review? How could you?! My question to you is have you actually seen this movie and thought about what it really is? Because if you did you'd agree with me that this is a shallow not particularly imaginative Christmas film with some bad child actors and the only reason people have some affection for it is because Tim Allen makes for a pretty good Santa Claus. The premise of the film is that Scott Calvin Tim Allen is a divorced father who is taking care of his son Charlie Eric Lloyd on Christmas Eve. When they hear a noise on the roof of their house they discover that Santa Claus is real... but he has disappeared leaving only his clothes behind. Charlie convinces his father to put on the red suit hop in the flying sleigh and finish delivering the presents not knowing that this means that by doing this his father has agreed to become the new Santa Claus.My biggest problem with this movie is that the story's message is a really shallow one. If you look at the character of Charlie at the beginning of the movie he doesn't like his father doesn't want to be anywhere near him and is overall being a pain in the neck. Numerous times he reiterates that he wants to spend as little time with his dad as possible during the holidays. When his father starts turning into Santa Claus though all of a sudden these feelings change. This kid only begins loving his father because he is magically turned into a man that gives toys away for free. Let's look at some of the lessons or messages that we get from some of the classic holiday stories. Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas teaches even cynics that Christmas is not about presents food or decorations but about being together with the people you love and making the best of the holiday season. A Christmas Carol proclaims that the true spirit of Christmas is having good will towards your fellow man and extending a helpful hand out of generosity and then goes on further to show that this spirit of Christmas should not be limited to only the 25th of December but to every day of the year. It's a Wonderful Life shows that kindness and generosity are their own reward and that even when things seem to be dire and inescapably bad the people that love you can gather and make it all OK that one life even if you don't think much of it impacts countless others in a way that you can't fathom. What is the message of The Santa Clause? If your kid doesn't warm up to you during the holiday magically transform yourself into Saint Nicholas and he'll change his mind. Thanks for that! Maybe I'm looking too much into this movie. I bet you're just saying that this is a light family comedy that's it. It doesn't mean to have any kind of message or deep meaning it's just a Christmasthemed movie. I'll admit that it's not all bad. Tim Allen as Scott Calvin is actually really good. He has the best lines throws himself fully in both the role of the frustrated father and Santa Claus and he not only looks the part he feels right. Tim Allen more than everything else in the movie combined made me laugh. I attribute the fact that people have affection for this movie solely on his performance and you can tell that he's having a good time. Considering he's the main character that goes a long way.Even with Tim Allen doing what he does this movie is still wrought with problems. This film feels like it was written not around a legitimate idea but around the pun in the title. There are so many things that are unexplained or that flatout make no sense. If Santa is running around giving people presents why do the adults not connect two and two together when they see all of those gifts come Christmas morning? Why is it that only children believe in Saint Nick? Does no one spot him and his flying sleigh going around? Is there some kind of evil cabal that conspires against everyone in the world to oppress the belief of Santa Claus? Why is Santa kept a secret anyway? Maybe we'll get the answers in the sequels. Even if you dismiss these questions there are some facts about this movie that are undeniable. First the child actors are not very good. It's bad enough that Charlie Scott's son is as wooden as a rocking horse but every elf in this movie is played by a child Well one or two of them might be teenagers and none of them are particularly convincing in their roles. I also really didn't care for the inconsistencies in the elf's magical powers and the numerous scenes where they feel the need to insert technology into Santa's Sleigh. He's been using magic for like a thousand years and all of a sudden it's no longer good enough so they have to gives the elves jet packs which leads to some big eyerolls for me and put all of these electronic gadgets in the sleigh. It just rubbed me the wrong way.I know a lot of people think of The Santa Clause as a holiday classic but it's just alright. It's just one of the endless Christmasthemed family movies that are just churned out annually that hit that soft spot for a lot of people and families have associated it with quality and the holiday ever since. The message is shallow the acting not particularly that good and the entire plot is based off a pun. Watch it for Tim Allen but don't forsake one of the better Christmas films in order to watch The Santa Clause. On VHS December 19 2014".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this movie very late the other night and I must say WOW! Like the rest of you I saw A Face In the Crowd on a regular VHS edition but it wouldn't matter which edition I saw it in because this was one of the few movies recently that made the jaw of this movie snob literally DROP with amazement over how daring how edgy and how much mastery this movie had over the filmmaking craft. I'm beginning to realize that in the 1950's there was a short period of time 19551960 say where the world of Broadway and the theater Television and Hollywood came together and the careers of people like Rod Serling Sidney Lumet and A Face In the Crowd's own Budd Schulberg were started. The best screenwriters in the movie business became innately aware of the increasing importance and influence of the new media form Television while the best directors like Elia Kazan many of whom had directed numerous plays knew how to cull the talents of Broadways hottest and most gifted performers and at least for a couple of years managed to get some awesome performances out of them. That's why I view this movie in the same sort of category as The Sweet Smell of Success that ever so sour and bitingly satiric parable on the corruption of American glamour and fame and how publicity is just as much of a curse as a blessing. The performances in that film are like few others in the same era and I think its no coincidence that A Face In the Crowd came out the same year as the other film. The main scribes of both those films Clifford Odets and Budd Schulberg were experienced with TV work by the time they penned their masterpieces though Schulberg could also claim as his masterpiece 'On the Waterfront'. So anyway I suggest to all who can hear me and have a love enough for this film to want to see it given the presentation it deserves that we all write to the Criterion Collection and other DVD distributing companies and ask no DEMAND that a restored cleaned up version of A Face In the Crowd with as many special features as can be rustled up be released as soon as possible. It's like writing your congressman except instead of asking for a new factory of national park we're asking for the wider availability of a piece of art that has gone with far too little acclaim for far too long. Who's with me?!?".

In fact Lonesome Rhodes is a slimy greedy egotistical manipulative womanizer with underhanded political aspirations and nothing but contempt for his gullible audience. The film was far ahead of its time in its theme and telling and Andy Griffith gives a blazing performance that rivals Burt Lancaster's in Elmer Gantry for which Lancaster won an Oscar. That this film wasn't even nominated for any awards is very surprising.I also am saddened that it's never been released on DVD it's one of the best of its kind I have ever seen and was certainly Griffith's plum role and best performance. With a stellar supporting cast including Patricia Neal Walter Matthau Tony Franciosa and a beautiful Lee Remick in her first film role A Face in the Crowd is a mustsee film and should eradicate any opinion you may have that Griffith was only capable of his wholesome TV roles of Sheriff Taylor and Ben Matlock.".

	schema:reviewBody "If ever there was a film that spoke to the ill advised road toward fame and fortune  paved with its good but unfortunately corrupting intentions  Elia Kazan's A Face In The Crowd 1957 is that film. It's a sort of perverse Picture of Dorian Gray brought up to then contemporary standards and ramped with all the slick split and polish of the emerging media age. The film stars the usually wholesome and congenial Andy Griffith as Larry 'Lonesome' Rhodes  an impoverished hobo whose saving grace is that he's got something to say and is certain people are willing to listen. One such interested party is promoter Marcia Jeffries Patricia Neal. With her connections and Larry's mouth the two embark upon a media blitz that transforms Larry from a good time guy into a perverse and power mad media sensation. With the swell of his ego comes the bitter and reclusive understanding that Larry has been forever changed  and not for the better. It is Larry's own realization and self discovery that he's become the man he was always destined to be  an unflattering uncaring and dangerous individual  that tops out this highly strung gruesome portrait of life without soul or redemption.Screenwriter Budd Schulberg on whose story The Arkansas Traveler this film is based keeps the pace of this manic and often oppressive tale up in a way that derives empathy and pity for the character of Larry while sitting in paralyzed and frightful awe of both Griffith's performance and the prospect that what we are seeing might be true for a good many more Hollywood celebs  both then and now  than we'd care to imagine. Kazan always the purveyor of 'message pictures' on this occasion is recanting what Shakespeare might have coined 'a tale told by an idiot. Full of sound and fury  signifying nothing'  nothing that is except one of the most exceptional entertainments you are likely to see in your lifetime.Warner's DVD is very nicely put together. The BW anamorphically enhanced picture exhibits solid blacks very clean whites and an impeccably balanced gray scale. Contrast levels are bang on. Fine details are nicely rendered throughout. The audio has been nicely cleaned up. A documentary Facing The Past takes the place on an audio commentary on this disc. It's short  at 30 min.  but nevertheless provides for a slew of succinct sound bytes from members of the principle cast.".

It is Larry's own realization and self discovery that he's become the man he was always destined to be  an unflattering uncaring and dangerous individual  that tops out this highly strung gruesome portrait of life without soul or redemption.Screenwriter Budd Schulberg on whose story The Arkansas Traveler this film is based keeps the pace of this manic and often oppressive tale up in a way that derives empathy and pity for the character of Larry while sitting in paralyzed and frightful awe of both Griffith's performance and the prospect that what we are seeing might be true for a good many more Hollywood celebs  both then and now  than we'd care to imagine. Kazan always the purveyor of 'message pictures' on this occasion is recanting what Shakespeare might have coined 'a tale told by an idiot. Full of sound and fury  signifying nothing'  nothing that is except one of the most exceptional entertainments you are likely to see in your lifetime.Warner's DVD is very nicely put together. The BW anamorphically enhanced picture exhibits solid blacks very clean whites and an impeccably balanced gray scale. Contrast levels are bang on. Fine details are nicely rendered throughout. The audio has been nicely cleaned up. A documentary Facing The Past takes the place on an audio commentary on this disc. It's short  at 30 min.  but nevertheless provides for a slew of succinct sound bytes from members of the principle cast.";

	schema:headline " Skewering Indictment of Television Comes Blazing Thanks to Peak Work from Kazan Schulberg Neal and Griffith";
	schema:reviewBody "There are two major things that I find quite fascinating as I watch this 1957 classic. The first is the prophetic hyperrealistic portrayal of television as a pervasive medium encroaching upon people's lives in ways unheard of back in the 1950's. The second is Andy Griffith's pullallthestops performance as drunken hoboturnedmedia sensation Lonesome Rhodes. For those who know Griffith only for his homespun TV portrayals you will be surprised how remarkably he shows the venal underbelly and highoctane charisma of a character miles away from kindly softspoken Sheriff Andy Taylor.Master filmmaker Elia Kazan and writer Budd Schulberg collaborating for the second and last time after their brilliant On the Waterfront three years earlier tell the story of Rhodes a burgeoning popculture phenomenon thanks primarily to the efforts of Marcia Jeffries a young radio program host who discovers him sprawled in a hangover on the floor of a rural Arkansas jail. He mesmerizes the local radio audience with an improvised country song about his predicament Free Man in the Morning and this marks the beginning of his meteoric rise all the way to his own weekly national TV program. As he capitalizes on his folksy charm and empathetic manner he becomes a powercrazed tyrant behind the scenes. A corporate tycoon wants to use Rhodes' influence to sway a Presidential campaign in his favor and Rhodes' megalomania moves him lockstep into a Citizen Kanelike form of paranoia.It all seems exaggerated but it's brilliantly observed much like a film that covered the same themes twenty years later Sidney Lumet and Paddy Chayefsky's Network. However even with strong doses of black comedy sprinkled throughout Kazan and Schulberg use more melodramatic elements in their skewering until the nearShakespearian climax when Rhodes' comeuppance takes on a grandly theatrical fervor. In a way it seems a shame that Griffith never got another chance to bring out his dark side on the big screen. While sometimes wildly undisciplined in his film debut he dexterously shows the cunning and charisma of his character to a level that makes his national celebrity utterly credible.Showing his amazing facility to elicit stellar work from a wide variety of actors Kazan assembled a strong cast to back him up starting with Patricia Neal who is just as devastating as Marcia a woman torn between ambition decency and her fateful attraction to Rhodes. An impossibly young Walter Matthau shows the beginnings of his cynical screen persona as Mel a crafty television writer who de facto becomes Marcia's conscience. In their film debuts and making indelible impressions Anthony Franciosa and Lee Remick play Joey an office lackey who turns into Rhodes' immoral agent and Betty Lou a teenaged baton twirler seduced easily by Rhodes' power respectively.If the film has one flaw it's that it runs on a bit long for the parable it tells especially since Rhodes' moral ambiguity is pretty much settled in the first half of the story. Nevertheless this movie is essential viewing as it not only shows a powerful early indictment of television and supports Marshall McLuhan's mantra The medium is the message but provides another example of the underappreciated artistry of Kazan and Schulberg. The 2005 DVD has unfortunately no commentary track but one strong extra a halfhour 2005 featurette Facing the Past which spotlights Kazan's polarizing testimony in front of the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities and the threatening role of television in the 1950's both major factors in making the film. Griffith Neal Schulberg are interviewed. There is also a widescreen version of the original film trailer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having read others' comments here and having just watched its new DVD I'll add my two cents. This has been one of my faves since first seeing it too long ago. Well it is more relevant than ever and should be seen be everyone literally!! I notice some likely younger folks mentioned comparisons to some contemporary politicians but indeed Lonesome Rhodes was based on the phenomenally successful and notoriously haughty radio  early TV host Arthur Godfrey. Yes Godfrey discovered Julius La Rosa but La Rosa probably got fired for asking for a raise after becoming very popular both on the show and solo records. Apparently Arthur like Lawrence Welk was a cheap prick skinflint who only paid scale  no matter what their tenure or how successful were his performers. A Face In the Crowd was most definitely social commentary NOT satire although as one from that era I can understand why it seemed so to many at the time. And also why it inspired so many talents! That this film was not nominated on its own merits due to political differencesgrudges is a GD crime! Can't say why Andy wasn't but he sure deserved it... Awesome!! So awesomeit actually effected his personal life. Anyway re politicians A face In the Crowd was a prescient warning of the dangers of that new media thus akin to those who subsequently capitalized on its propaganda value and the science of people's weakness of mistaking image for truth!But Kazan was not simply a great director he was perhaps the most socially conscious of all Hollywood directors!! And he was one of the great actors' directors hence why you never saw an Andy Griffith act like in this film again! The DVD also has an excellent uptodate documentary about the making of AFITC and its genesis with many pertinent historical tidbits re Kazan. In just 21 films Kazan directed at least 10 GREAT films America America 1963 Wild River 1960 Baby Doll 1956 East of Eden 1955 On the Waterfront 1954 Viva Zapata! 1952 A Streetcar Named Desire 1951 Panic in the Streets 1950 Gentleman's Agreement 1947 and A Tree Grows in Brooklyn 1945. In his films 21 different actors had Oscarnominated performances James Dunn Celeste Holm Gregory Peck Dorothy McGuire Anne Revere Jeanne Crain Ethel Barrymore Ethel Waters Karl Malden Vivien Leigh Kim Hunter Marlon Brando Anthony Quinn Eva Marie Saint Lee J. Cobb Rod Steiger Jo Van Fleet James Dean Carroll Baker Mildred Dunnock and Natalie Wood  of which Dunn Holm Malden Leigh Hunter Quinn Brando Saint and Van Fleet ALL won Oscars for their performances in one of Kazan's movies.Not too shabby eh!?".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know if TCM intentionally counterprogrammed the Trump inauguration by scheduling Elia Kazan's film about a fauxpopulist demagogue on the same day as the ceremony but it sure looks like it and I approve. Like Trump A Face in the Crowd's Larry Lonesome Rhodes Andy Griffith is a product of the media's amoral pursuit of the colorful character a man lifted to uncommon power by those entertained by the flamboyance and vulgarity. Rhodes perhaps like Trump isn't so much the villain of Budd Schulberg's story and screenplay as are his enablers Marcia Jeffries Patricia Neal and Mel Miller Walter Matthau and his exploiters like Joey DePalma Anthony Franciosa who enrich themselves while discovering the previously untapped potential of mass media. In 1957 this potential was just beginning to be realized but 60 years later it had taken a dangerous man to the White House. I don't think Kazan and Schulberg fully realized that possibility just as Sidney Lumet and Paddy Chayefsky didn't fully realize the prescience of Network Lumet 1976. Both films should serve as a permanent warning that today's satire is tomorrow's nightmare. A Face in the Crowd is an important film without being a great one. Schulberg's screenplay falls apart in the middle and the denouement in which Marcia somehow comes to her senses and exposes Rhodes as a fraud is awkward and mechanical largely because Marcia herself is something of a mechanical character. An actress of considerable skill Neal does what she can to make the character live but the words aren't there in the script to explain why she tolerates Rhodes's fraudulence as long as she does. Matthau and Franciosa come off a little better because their roles are written as stereotypes Cynical Writer and Gogetting Hot Shot. So the film really belongs to Griffith who parlays his deadeyed shark's grin into something that should have been the foundation of a career with more highlights than a folksy sitcom and an oldfart detective show. It's a charismatic but ragged performance that needed a little more shaping from writer and director something that Kazan admitted to himself in his diaries when he wrote about Rhodes and the film The complexity ... was left out. Rather than having Rhodes revealed as a fraud to his followers Kazan said Rhodes should have been allowed to recognize that he had been trapped his own fraudulence. Deprived of anagnorisis a moment of tragic selfrecognition Rhodes becomes a figure of melodrama bellowing Marcia! from the balcony at the end but probably fated to make what Miller suggests to him the comeback of a hasbeen. Fortunately Kazan and Schulberg were wise enough to change their original ending in which Rhodes commits suicide  there's not enough tragedy in their conception of the character for that. charlesmatthews.blogspot.com".

The list of various people Rhodes is compared to includes Bill Clinton Ronald Reagan Howard Stern Rush Limbaugh Michael Moore or George W.

I did a doubletake on watching this film when the reactionary rightwing presidential candidate that Rhodes promotes begins to pontificate about how unAmerican the notion of social security is and how it's high time it was dismantled. That was 1957 and that cause is being worked harder than ever today. I was not aware until reading some of the other comments here how central a target Arthur Godfrey was in this story. In fact I believe Godfrey is actually mentioned by name in the film when Rhodes says something like Have Arthur Godfrey fill in for me and tell him I'll return the favor some time.Anyway while this film hardly needs yet another accolade I'll add mine to the list and say that it's one of the great underappreciated films of its time and only grows with stature as the years go on.

What this film REALLY is is a condemnation of mass media and how the media builds up people to images they can't possibly fulfill. Take Griffith small town drunk in jail with a story to tell and a woman to record it. His story goes over with the public and the woman decides to make Rhodes a media darling. On the other side of the screen is the smoke filled room political machine out to publicize a washed up yokel as politician that they put up for election. Sound familiar? See the film NETWORK and compare Rhodes to the Peter Finch character Howard Beale.This film is a scathing indictment of misuse of media pseudo stardom and all that goes with it. It is allegory to be sure but then everything old is new again. Take a look at the so called celebrities of today and how they got that way and what makes them tick... then watch A Face In The Crowd!!!!!".

What this film REALLY is is a condemnation of mass media and how the media builds up people to images they can't possibly fulfill. Take Griffith small town drunk in jail with a story to tell and a woman to record it. His story goes over with the public and the woman decides to make Rhodes a media darling. On the other side of the screen is the smoke filled room political machine out to publicize a washed up yokel as politician that they put up for election. Sound familiar? See the film NETWORK and compare Rhodes to the Peter Finch character Howard Beale.This film is a scathing indictment of misuse of media pseudo stardom and all that goes with it. It is allegory to be sure but then everything old is new again. Take a look at the so called celebrities of today and how they got that way and what makes them tick... then watch A Face In The Crowd!!!!!";

	schema:reviewBody "Budd Schulberg wrote this and the story it was based on. He doesn't get the kind of credit he deserves. He did some hard research for On the Waterfront in order to dig up lines like You take away dem pistoleros you got in there and you're nothing'. You hear me? You're NUTHIN'. Compared to On the Waterfront though this politically tinged drama is overwritten and its dialog lacks the same ineluctable force. It's still pretty good no mistake about that but it seems to depict a time when we were an awful lot more naive about TV and politics than we are now.Or does it? The first major political advertisement back in the early 50s was so monumentally harmless. A cute smiling little cartoon figure on the order of Elmer Fudd marches across the screen holding a sign which a lilting chorus reads out for the audience in case they can't read. I like Ike. I like Ike. Everybody likes Ike. Those were the good old days.This story involves Andy Griffith who begins as an absolutely guileless exjailbird whose only talent is his appeal to the common man by playing it as the dumb flaneur he actually is. Recruited for a TV commercial by a reporter Patricia Neal he makes fun of the product and the audience loves it. By leaps and bounds he climbs the ladder to TV stardom as a seller of products like Vitajex and the bald Senator Curly Fuller. And then Schulberg the writer has him go apparently maniacal overnight. Shouting bullying pompous and ultimately destroyed by Pat Neal the woman he's used and abused from the beginning.One of the reasons the film is so important is that it tagged the period when politics was switching from innocent cartoons to the kind of suppurating mindless smears we're witnessing today. A character points out that nobody wants to listen to longwinded debates anymore. They want slogans now called sound bites like The Family That Prays Together Stays Together More Bang for the Buck The Mess in Washington Mission Accomplished. Oops. Maybe a misquote in there but it illustrates the point. The talking points and sound bites are still hard at work and we're still swallowing without chewing not that much more sophisticated than we were in 1957.If the film seems a little dated today it's only because the future it shows us has now arrived. And worse because now we have the internet where a whisper can become a roar overnight. The issues are amazingly resilient. Griffith promotes a presidential candidate and they sit around the Old Cracker Barrel on his TV show dissing Social Security because everybody wants coddling. Did Daniel Boone have Social Security? No. All he needed was a gun and his freedom. Andy Griffith is a nice guy. He was my supporting player in an episode of Matlock. Good sense of humor as unpretentious as his screen persona but no dummy a showbiz pro. He didn't make that many films but this one is quite good and No Time for Sergeants was a generally successful comedy. He's way over the top in some scenes but is able to modulate his performance to accommodate moments in which his character is more thoughtful.This was his film debut also Anthony Franciosa edgy as always a bottle of ambitious champagne about to pop its cork and Lee Remick who was 22 when this was shot but looks a convincing 17 years old. Man can she swing a baton. Patricia Neal turns in her usual quietly effective performance. She was never a glamor puss and she's perfect for the part of the loyal friend and sometimelover of the hero Lonesome Rhodes. It's believable that he should throw her over for Lee Remick's airhead because Rhodes himself sees nothing in anyone except the extent of their value to him kind of like the way humans look at the Earth. What a splendid place the Grand Canyon is. Let's build a row of motels and Burger Queens along the rims! It isn't that Neal's steadfastness and genuine love for him doesn't mean anything to Rhodes. It's just that he doesn't see it. Walter Matthau is a college graduate whom Rhodes sneers at as an elitist calling him Vanderbilt '44 and Frontal Lobe.Okay the movie's overwrought at times but it really ought to be seen for its aesthetic as well as its didactic value. I ought to add that it stands up well on reviewings despite the occasional overstatement and clumsiness. The performances are nearly flawless and the direction is more than competent. Keep an eye on Griffith's sidekick Beanie to see what I mean.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a maddening movie. On one hand the story deals with a substantive topicTV's capacity for exploitation by demagogues of ordinary folks on the other the movie's too long too loud and dominated by a tiresome onenote performance.Back in '57 Kazan's cynical production was much discussed by pundits and media types. Dealing with the new medium of television was also of general interest as audiences became aware of its impact. The fact that huge numbers tuned in weekly to shows like Ed Sullivan or I Love Lucy bespoke TV's power to influence national audiences. Now of course that mass audience has splintered with the advent of cable and computers. Nonetheless topics dealt with in the movie such as the role of advertising and personality promotion remain relevant even in today's more diversified media.To me the movie's main message would have been more effective had Rhodes been made more likable or at least more subtle. Then I could see why his TV persona was so seductive to so many. The trouble is that Rhodes is obnoxious from jailhouse beginning to penthouse close. His alligator grin is anything but friendly. The claim in '57 was that the expose was aimed at TV impresario Arthur Godfrey host of a number of popular programs of the day. But Rhodes' blustery onscreen demeanor is totally unlike the laidback Godfrey whose ukulele strumming easygoing manner could easily be seen as attracting a mass audience.Likability or subtlety aside one way of taking Rhodes' early appeal is suggested by two things he's both authentic and unpredictable. He's a proud hayseed unashamed of the corn pone he projects to his likeminded rural audience. Plus he's really unpredictable on camera. You never know what he's going to do or say as his mattress company sponsor finds out. It's refreshing to hear him level with the audience on the sponsor's unexceptional product. And it's no particular stretch to see people responding by buying the product. In that sense Rhodes stands as a marketing innovator one who would naturally attract wider industry interest as he does.But his corn pone manner becomes a stretch once he hits the big time. To that point his appeal comes from shared Southern folkways. But once he goes national we have to assume those regionalisms apply nationally even into coveted big city markets. Couple that stretch with his loud buffoonish manner and the believability factor snaps apart. Whatever else Lonesome Rhodes is certainly no Arthur Godfrey.I expect other reviewers are right. Rhodes' obnoxious character is the creation of big city boys Schulberg and Kazan who take a dim stereotypical view of the rural South. In fact Rhodes amounts to what a city sophisticate's view of a cunning hayseed might be like. Then too it's city boy Miller's Matthau voice of reason that's counterposed to the powerhungry media star. Of course some regional balance is achieved when the slippery talent agent Franciosa joins the money train. But the impression of a bias nonetheless remains.A less noticed aspect of the screenplay is the potential for political exploitation of the medium. In 1957 the political potential of TV had yet to be broadly felt. It wasn't until 1960 that the new medium's impact was experienced presidentially as Nixon learned in his debates with the more telegenic Kennedy. Still the film brought a timely matter before the public even though it's treated as secondary to Rhodes' public meltdown. In the movie the general Waram is a rather sinister power broker looking to use Rhodes' populist appeal to promote his handpicked candidate for president Neilan. Thus Rhodes is ultimately connected to the highest levels of political power and his dreams run rampant. It also proves enough to push him over the edge into raving megalomania. In the end then the power of TV has helped turn an unassuming country boy into a raving monster the shot of him in distorted silhouette. All in all the movie was an important one for its time and still resonates on a human level. The trouble lies with Griffith's unsubtle onenote performance. In that regard I'm not sure whether the fault lies with the actor the director the screenwriter or some combination thereof. But one thing for sure at least in my little book too many wellmeaning folks confuse bluster with good acting. Plus the overacting is deadly for the movie's underlying plausibility. Nonetheless the lessons of power and corruption in the media world remain as relevant now as it was then.".

	schema:reviewBody "Elia Kazan will always be remembered as one of the most important directors of his era. With great movies like A Streetcar Named Desire and On The Waterfront he forever established his position in cinema history. A Face in the Crowd is one of his lesser known movies that flopped at the box office when it was initially released and was completely ignored by the Academy. It only got some following much later when it was released on DVD which is a shame since A Face in the Crowd doesn't greatly differ from Kazan's more popular movies. To correct this historical injustice I decided to review this movie and spread the word about it as much as I can.The movie opens with a young woman named Marcia Jeffries Patricia Neal visiting the prison in her small town. She is doing a radio show called 'A Face in the Crowd' during which she talks with everyday people transmitting their stories. In the prison she meets a man who calls himself 'Lonesome' Rhodes Andy Griffith  a hobo arrested for drunk and disorderly behavior. She tapes him for her show and the episode becomes a huge hit. Marcia and her uncle who is the owner of the local radio station on which 'A Face in the Crowd' airs offer 'Lonesome' a job on the radio station. He accepts and soon becomes a sensation with the local populace  and eventually with the whole country.A Face in the crowd is what you may call a movie ahead of its time and that's maybe why it wasn't recognized when it was initially released. It deals with topics like the media celebrities propaganda and politics. And in this day and age when we are surrounded by the internet and the mass media A Face in the Crowd may seem more actual than ever. A Face in the Crowd is essentially about a corrupted man who has a gift for public relations and uses this gift as means to an end  the end being his own benefit. I think every last one of us knows at least one politician public personality or celebrity who is just like that. A Face in the Crowd is a dark frighteningly realistic movie which is brilliantly directed and masterfully paced. It runs for over 2 hours but never feels dull or boring.In a character study movie like this one the actor portraying the character plays a very important part in the quality of the movie. 'Lonesome' Rhodes is portrayed by Andy Griffith in his first movie performance ever. He did an astonishingly great job and like I said before it's a shame that the Academy overlooked this movie especially his performance. Andy Griffith later went to start in the very popular sitcom 'The Andy Griffith Show' and since his character in the sitcom was much different from his 'Lonesome' Rhodes character he managed to show his amazing acting range  which makes makes his performance in A Face in the Crowd even more astonishing. Patricia Neal also did a very good job in portraying the character of Marcia Jeffries. Overall A Face in the Crowd is an amazing movie made by talented people which doesn't deserve to be just another face in the crowd  it deserves to be more popular.Rating 810 Read more at httppasspopcorn.com".

Marcia and her uncle who is the owner of the local radio station on which 'A Face in the Crowd' airs offer 'Lonesome' a job on the radio station. He accepts and soon becomes a sensation with the local populace  and eventually with the whole country.A Face in the crowd is what you may call a movie ahead of its time and that's maybe why it wasn't recognized when it was initially released. It deals with topics like the media celebrities propaganda and politics. And in this day and age when we are surrounded by the internet and the mass media A Face in the Crowd may seem more actual than ever. A Face in the Crowd is essentially about a corrupted man who has a gift for public relations and uses this gift as means to an end  the end being his own benefit. I think every last one of us knows at least one politician public personality or celebrity who is just like that. A Face in the Crowd is a dark frighteningly realistic movie which is brilliantly directed and masterfully paced. It runs for over 2 hours but never feels dull or boring.In a character study movie like this one the actor portraying the character plays a very important part in the quality of the movie. 'Lonesome' Rhodes is portrayed by Andy Griffith in his first movie performance ever. He did an astonishingly great job and like I said before it's a shame that the Academy overlooked this movie especially his performance. Andy Griffith later went to start in the very popular sitcom 'The Andy Griffith Show' and since his character in the sitcom was much different from his 'Lonesome' Rhodes character he managed to show his amazing acting range  which makes makes his performance in A Face in the Crowd even more astonishing. Patricia Neal also did a very good job in portraying the character of Marcia Jeffries. Overall A Face in the Crowd is an amazing movie made by talented people which doesn't deserve to be just another face in the crowd  it deserves to be more popular.Rating 810 Read more at httppasspopcorn.com";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a motion picture with a very powerful storyline which has the coveted accolade of being directed by world renowned director Elia Kazan! In this film A Face In The Crowd Kazan works very closely with Bud Schulberg he was the writer of this movie. This procedure is indicative of Elia Kazan's modus operandi with previous pictures he has directed. As was the case with Streetcar Named Desire On The Waterfront as well as A Face In The Crowd Kazan works in tandem with the writers of his movies as a measure of purporting an authentic impact of the actual screenplay. Such a necessary commiseration between writers and directors is a cunningly successful technique which I wholeheartedly concur with! Elia Kazan was a director who was very controversial. Kazan became a political scapegoat who was scrutinized by the American Ethics Subcommittee for subversive behavior back sometime in the late 1940's. As a result of being an artifact for McCarthyist phobia professional complications began to surface ultimately Elia Kazan eschewed this notion altogether and from that point on he began to incorporate an intrepid and noncommittal ambiguity to every film in which he subsequently directed since Gentleman's Agreement in 1947. The film A Face In The Crowd is an acrimonious depiction of the television industry being every bit as much of an ethically defunct corporate nightmare as any existing Fortune 500 company in the United States. Andy Griffith starts out as an unassuming and innocuous boll weevil bumpkin who has garnered a quaint charisma with the Arkansas media. Once he is elevated into the limelight of prime time television he thus became a neon accented spawn of Madison Avenue flow charts. He and his agent Tony Franciosa became infected with megalomania and avariciousness to the point where they perceived the American television market to be mere chattel for their slightest caprice. The paradox between egomaniacal obsession and homespun entertainment became ruthlessly dichotomized by all of the powerful New York television executives involved with making programming decisions! Patricia Neal always typecast as the character of hard bitten reality played Andy Griffith's succor for perpetual amelioration. Ultimately she became crestfallen by his egregious human pitfalls! She was instrumental for giving Lonesome Rhodes Andy Griffith his start in show business. Realizing that he now wanted to establish with her an edict to justify his vehement disdain for the general public! His excessive drinking lead to his overall liquor laden line of logic being one which was tantamount to petty pontification from the bottle! Lonesome Rhodes became a cult figure who used his clout to cultivate a state of virulent insanity for the television industry! The entire film illustrates some very genuine human reactions and becomes sarcastically sanguine about the cause and effect traumas which afflict the unsuspecting television audience. The film A Face In The Crowd is likened to the movie Network. While I thought that Network was far more compelling especially with regards to it's dialog I felt both films accomplished a stellar feat that was pertinent to the portrayal of some very visceral and individualistic interactions! Both of these movies effectuate a very somber reality about how television programming is reduced to the sorry element of a marketable commodity. Network and A Face In The Crowd were very avant garde films which had the auspicious recognition for purveying the concept that the informative value to television shows was nothing more than a sensationalistic by product that took second fiddle importance to more pressing factors such as Ratings share and dollar demand per commercial minute potential!! Other films that were compared to A Face In The Crowd were Giant and Thank You For Smoking. I can most assuredly envision such an analogy all of these movies possess a very intense behavioral rancor! Every one of these three films spreads out the welcome mat for an incongruous volatility to habitually surface! The film A Face In The Crowd evokes a very definite subornation of an abhorrently despicable deception with the small screen viewers! These precarious ideologies are relegated to nothing more than a corrupt candor which harbors a distasteful set of priorities that many people would perceive to be overtly destructive! Andy Griffin's dipsomania and boorishness severely distorts his ability to think rationally and that becomes the insidious culprit for everything that relates to his ultimate calamities! The film A Face In The Crowd is a spectacular movie the acting is superb the performers include Andy Griffith Patricia Neal Tony Franciosa Lee Remickand Walter Mathiau Mathiau's diatribe about the ratings gambit at the end of the film was philosophically gripping. The writing in this movie is absolutely compelling! Finally the director Elia Kazan is a master at articulating pejorative human emotions. The film A Face In The Crowd is one of the best films ever to be produced in the American cinema world. A Face In The Crowd did not win the Academy Award for best picture in 1957 this is probably due to the fact that it had the heinous misfortune of being produced during the same year as Bridge On The River Kwai. Bridge On The River Kwai won for best picture in 1957 and also Bridge on the River Kwai has been rated the 12th best American film ever made by the critics of A.F.I. Nevertheless A Face In The Crowd was a fabulous picture and I strongly recommend to anyone that this movie should be put in the category of a must see!! FIVE STARS!! NO QUESTION ABOUT IT!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Who said that they don't make films like they used to? A couple of weeks ago I declared that The Departed was the best film of 2006. Last week I replaced the Scorsese epic with Sofia Coppola's luscious biopic of Marie Antoinette. I never would have guessed that Paul Verhoeven Yes the Paul Verhoeven who directed Total Recall Basic Instinct  Showgirls!!! would challenge them both with a gripping edgeofyourseat World War II yarn.I use the oldfashioned term yarn because Black Book is very much a film that feels like it was made decades ago. The lush visuals orchestral music European styling wartime romanticism and cliffhanging chapters all add a certain 1950's charm to the whiteknuckle plot. One gets the feeling that the ghosts of Gregory Peck Hedy Lamarr Ava Gardner Spencer Tracy  Jean Harlow are embodying the cast of this classic espionage drama.The film begins in 1956 with Rachel Steinn a school teacher at an Israeli kibbutz being accidentally found by an old acquaintance who is on vacation with her husband. The meeting brings back painful wartime memories and Rachel heads to a quiet place by the river to recollect our central story.So back we travel to occupied Holland circa 1944 and we see a more youthful Rachel diligently practicing a bible passage in order to earn a meal from the family who is hiding her from the Germans. She like many Jews at that time were surviving by any means necessary in order to outlast the Nazi tyranny. However one day while flirting with a young man sailing on the nearby lake her safe zone is destroyed in one fell swoop by a low flying bomber. Rachel is immediately on the run aided by her new sailor friend.So much of this film relies on surprises and shocking twists that it would be unfair of me to detail too many plot threads. And my goodness there are a tons of them. This is truly a definitive epic in every cinematic sense of the word. Rachel is crossed and doubledcrossed and triplecrossed eventually winding up as a member of the famed Resistance.

Black Book satisfies everything that I truly want from a film. It is the reason I go to the movies. I was utterly swept away by the intrigue drama romance and tragedy. This emotionally weighty film even manages to deliver a few wonderfully witty moments to break the supreme tension of it all.The cast is immense. Every one of them exudes authenticity. It is one of the best ensembles of the year. However I struggle to call it an ensemble because it would be ignoring one of the singular performances in recent memory. Carice Van Houten is not a household name to most. She is a Dutch beauty who if this role is anything to go by is on the verge of a magnificent career. Her grasp on the emotional turmoil of RachelEllis is of profound proportions. It is a stunning turn that flatly demands award consideration. The range on display in this movie is astonishing. Rarely have I ever been as moved by a character's heroism and charm and guile and wits. She is able to create a sympathetic creature... one that we will root for until the end... one that we trust and believe in.I cannot leave this review without admitting to my utter admiration for Paul Verhoeven a director whose films I have often enjoyed and panned in equal measures. This is the work of his lifetime. It is the film he should list above all others on his rsum. This is a thoughtful poignant and tremendously thrilling adventure. For attentive viewers the final scenes of the film act as a provocative meditation on the relationships between war and justice peace and insularity the actions of the past and the promises of the future.

	onyx:emotionText "Who said that they don't make films like they used to? A couple of weeks ago I declared that The Departed was the best film of 2006. Last week I replaced the Scorsese epic with Sofia Coppola's luscious biopic of Marie Antoinette. I never would have guessed that Paul Verhoeven Yes the Paul Verhoeven who directed Total Recall Basic Instinct  Showgirls!!! would challenge them both with a gripping edgeofyourseat World War II yarn.I use the oldfashioned term yarn because Black Book is very much a film that feels like it was made decades ago. The lush visuals orchestral music European styling wartime romanticism and cliffhanging chapters all add a certain 1950's charm to the whiteknuckle plot. One gets the feeling that the ghosts of Gregory Peck Hedy Lamarr Ava Gardner Spencer Tracy  Jean Harlow are embodying the cast of this classic espionage drama.The film begins in 1956 with Rachel Steinn a school teacher at an Israeli kibbutz being accidentally found by an old acquaintance who is on vacation with her husband. The meeting brings back painful wartime memories and Rachel heads to a quiet place by the river to recollect our central story.So back we travel to occupied Holland circa 1944 and we see a more youthful Rachel diligently practicing a bible passage in order to earn a meal from the family who is hiding her from the Germans. She like many Jews at that time were surviving by any means necessary in order to outlast the Nazi tyranny. However one day while flirting with a young man sailing on the nearby lake her safe zone is destroyed in one fell swoop by a low flying bomber. Rachel is immediately on the run aided by her new sailor friend.So much of this film relies on surprises and shocking twists that it would be unfair of me to detail too many plot threads. And my goodness there are a tons of them. This is truly a definitive epic in every cinematic sense of the word. Rachel is crossed and doubledcrossed and triplecrossed eventually winding up as a member of the famed Resistance. Via cunning and fortunate circumstance she manages to transform herself into Ellis de Vries a blond bombshell who infiltrates the German command in the area. She uses a quick wit a gorgeous voice some feminine charms and a collection of Queen Wilhelmina stamps to crawl her way into the arms of Herr Mntze Sebastian Koch.From deep within the Nazi camp she is able to strategically plant a microphone and to use tidbits of acquired knowledge in order to provide the Resistance with vital information and plans.

Although my main interest lies in independent film and I did see many indies as well as foreign films and documentaries in Toronto I also saw a few of the Gala selections. Of those big movies on my list the one which impressed me the most was this Dutch production from Paul Verhoeven. Set in Nazioccupied Holland during World War II the film centers around a young Jewish woman named Rachel who changes her name and hair and personality and more to Ellis and enters an odyssey of determination and sheer luck in an effort to survive what would otherwise be certain death.Make no mistake about it this is an epic in the true sense of the word. The visuals are stunning. Everything about the production from the sound to the effects to the score says big budget. The story is chock full of more twists and turns than just about any film I've seen in this genre. And just when you think that perhaps Verhoeven is beginning to stretch the bounds of credulity you realize at the end credits if not before that Black Book is based on fact.Most of all the film's power is due to the magnificent acting of Carice van Houten. Her RachelEllis is a character so unique so original that it holds up against the great heroines of contemporary cinema. Combine her marvelous performance with a wonderful story and superb production values and you end up with a thrill ride from start to finish. Black Book left me breathless.".

It's evident this film was a more personal project for him. Non stop action and good acting especially from the lead actress Carice van Houten. I've seen other films American and French about Resistance fighters during WWII but non of them gripped me by the throat like this one. I admit Verhoeven is at times a bit heavyhanded especially the sound effects of German machine guns but the story never sags. It's a By the seat of your pants type of movie. After you leave the theater the impact of the story stays with you for days. Go and see it when it comes to your local cinema in North America. I highly recommend it.".

What strikes me most is that some people expect to get a movie in which everything is clear. I think this is a movie which should set us to thinking what would I do if I were in the same situation. Paul Verhoeven made clear with this movie that in the end lots of people act for their own prosperity. It's just what you make people around you believe... I think in lots of countries people acted like this none of the countries however dared to make a movie out of it. To me this movie is again as Soldaat van Oranje and for instance De Tweelinga beautiful one about WWII without getting boring. A smart story with two faces. Although some of the actors don't really fit into a masterpiece like this I give it a great compliment.

The fame of films like Basic Instinct and Total Recall is lasting yet they court criticism with their use of sexuality or by playing to the easily dismissible scifi genre. Graphic sex and violence are common in his movies and when you add the occasional major flop such as Showgirls the work of Verhoeven often fails to be taken seriously. Yet Black Book deserves respect. It is a wartime resistance movie on an epic scale freed of the conventions of British and American war movies yet bringing their typically high production values to a uniquely Dutch film.Israel 1956. A Holy Land Tours bus stops off at a Kibbutz. One of the passengers recognises a teacher there Rachel from times they had shared during the war. As her friend leaves Rachel thinks back to Holland in 1944. She was an accomplished cabaret singer but also Jewish. She was in hiding waiting for the war to end. But chance misfortune means she has to try to make a getaway with some other Jewish people. They are ambushed and she is almost shot. A little later she starts working for the resistance 'terrorists' as the Nazis call them and infiltrates the Gestapo seducing a high ranking officer called Muntze.What follows is a frantic game of cat and mouse espionage and counterespionage. Rachel now called Ellis is torn between the horrors inflicted on her friends closeby and the elaborate deceits she tries to play to save them. Gradually it becomes clear that Muntze anticipating the end of the war is risking his neck to try to minimize death and suffering on both sides and one or more of the resistance fighters is selling out to the Nazis to reap rich profits. Muntze like Rachel has had to overcome great losses. Their humanity is a bridge that brings them closer.RachelEllis is played by Carice van Houten a leading actress of the Dutch screen. Her presence is luminous and charismatic for BritishAmerican audiences there is the curious sensation of watching someone unknown who radiates star quality with every breath. Her character has to adapt to many contrasting situations yet there is an underlying determination and fast thinking that shines through and makes such changes seem in character and unscripted. We share her emotional struggle and watch her pit her wits against the Gestapo who are not exactly stupid. The movie is worth seeing for her performance alone.On the one hand the film has been minutely researched based on actual events and characters on the other it still has the slightly larger than life gloss we might associate say with a James Bond film. The escapes are in the nick of time the sex scenes are steamy and the plot twists increase exponentially as we get closer to the end.Not content to portray the unique conditions of Holland during the occupation Black Book goes on to catalogue post war atrocities and Rachel's eventual journey to Israel. The style and delivery will not appeal to everyone but Black Book is Verhoeven on top form delivering grand entertainment that shows his talents and those of the remarkable Carice van Houten at their finest.".

Without losing sight of the importance of the resistance against the foreign repression Paul Verhoeven confuses his audience by visualizing how ones own wellbeing seems to go at the cost of the wellbeing of another. No black and white no bad or good but only the individual choice that is tormented by the will to survive and a feeling for morality.The film is daring for showing the dark side of the Dutch national history.

	schema:headline " The best dutch production in 2030 years";
	schema:reviewBody "I have been eagerly waiting to see 'Zwartboek' the past months. Finally it premiered in Holland today and i immediately rushed to cinema to be one of the first to see it. Beforehand i didn't watch any trailer nor read any review so i went in completely not knowing what to expect.The movie starts a bit messy. Not knowing what it wants and where it wants to go. But as soon as things are set the rollercoaster ride begins. Carice and Sebastian are simply outstanding. Together they really carry the movie. The story however is predictable at times but the awesome production quality for dutch standards and fast paced action really make up for it.The overall message which i will not give away is something to think about. See the movie and judge for yourself.I have heard this will be sent in for the Oscars. As much as i would want Paul to win i don't think it will happen. There will be other movies with a story less predictable and more surprising. However my heart would want him to win this and walk out with a big figurative finger pointed at all them critics.Zwartboek is in my opinion the best dutch production in 2030 years maybe even the best dutch movie since Soldier of Orange. It doesn't disappoint it doesn't bore and it will give you a ride which you won't forget. It is also the breakthrough of Carice van Houten. Rave reviews from Venice compare her to Scarlett Johansson but even better. Future will tell...For now go see this! And for Paul please stay in Holland and make dutch cinema proud again.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have been eagerly waiting to see 'Zwartboek' the past months. Finally it premiered in Holland today and i immediately rushed to cinema to be one of the first to see it. Beforehand i didn't watch any trailer nor read any review so i went in completely not knowing what to expect.The movie starts a bit messy. Not knowing what it wants and where it wants to go. But as soon as things are set the rollercoaster ride begins. Carice and Sebastian are simply outstanding. Together they really carry the movie. The story however is predictable at times but the awesome production quality for dutch standards and fast paced action really make up for it.The overall message which i will not give away is something to think about. See the movie and judge for yourself.I have heard this will be sent in for the Oscars. As much as i would want Paul to win i don't think it will happen.

And the general view of the Alliance is good and the Germans are bad isn't presented. The movie shows both sides the good the bad and the ugly behaviors of the people during the war.Although he didn't have a very big budget to make this movie between 1620 million dollars which is nothing for Hollywood matters he'd made quite a good movie from it.If you want to watch a movie about WWII that isn't like most of the movies made about this war go and watch this one.

	schema:reviewBody "I seem to be the first in the US to comment on this film after having seen it at a regular theater.There's no sense in talking about the movie's plot as so many others have already done so.My fiance is German and tends to be interested in those artsy foreign films. Tonight she decided we should go see this one. I'm glad we did.I've seen a number of Paul Verhoeven's films and have found some of them quite entertaining if a bit tacky and unrealistic. I wasn't expecting much from a Dutch film by a guy known for making big budget tacky films.I was pleasantly surprised by this film.Yes it most certainly IS a Paul Verhoeven film. Gratuitous nudity and violence seem to be his hallmarks and they're certainly not lacking. Do they detract from the movie? A little but not enough to lose sight of the message of the film  or to make it any less enjoyable.We had recently seen The Lives of Others which starred Sebastian Koch. It made his character oddly familiar. I'm certainly a fan of his after seeing his performance in both of these movies.As for Carice van Houten... well one of the marks of a true STAR is that you just can't take your eyes off of him or her. It isn't just beauty there are plenty of beautiful women in the world who don't possess that same star quality. It isn't just talent either there are many very talented actresses out there who just don't draw you in in the same way. Carice van Houten has it all she's beautiful in a very real way and an amazing talent  and has that something special that makes you look at her every second she's on screen. I hope the directors of the world take note of her because she deserves the stardom she has exhibited in this film.It is good to see a film that depicts how the hunted can easily turn into the hunter. My fiance's mother was a young girl during WWII who's family lived in Poland near Gdansk aka Danzig. Towards the end of the war they were forced to leave their home in fear for their lives  both from the advancing Russians and the local Poles exacting revenge for what other Germans had done. The film said it in a slightly different sentence but it is right in bringing across the message that people seem to never learn that it is NEVER right to hurt others no matter what they might have done in the past.I wonder if Paul Verhoeven's family is Jewish because he really seems to identify with the never ending succession of attacks against the Jewish people. It saddens me that only ONE other review even mentioned the scene at the end where Rachel's community in Israel was being attacked. Part of the film's message is that we seemed doomed to repeat our inhumanity to our fellow man.Was this a perfect movie? Certainly not. Is it a masterpiece ala Schindler's List or Full Metal Jacket or Saving Private Ryan? Probably not. But I'll say that in the several hours since I've seen it I can't stop thinking about it. And I certainly enjoyed every minute of that 212 hour film while watching it. I'd watch it again if I had it on DVD.".

After being blown away by Black Book it was easy to persuade my wife to see it a week later  and she too was blown away. You're best off not knowing much of the plot  this film takes twists and turns that amaze and astound. The less you know about it the better. Let's just say that the writing plotting direction and acting are all top notch  better than any other film I've seen all year. No scene is wasted. Black Book is one of those films where something that happens early on comes back as an important plot point later in the film. So while you're enjoying this wild rollercoaster emotional ride pay attention to the details and what people say  because not a word is wasted.Black Book is simply film making at its best. There are some darn good reasons that Black Book is still playing in several Chicago theaters nearly 4 months after its release.".

It is a very impressive and exciting and dramatic story of a Jewish girl that gets involved in the Resistancemovement in World War 2. When she wants to escape the Germans she finds her family killed in front of her eyes. She is rescued and becomes an important member of the Dutch Resistance. She has to act like a spy at the headquarters of the SD and even has to sleep with the head of the SD who happens to turn out to be the only good German in the movie. I won't tell you what happens but the movie gives a very good impression of the terrors of war what people do in these circumstances the thin line between good and bad and betrayal. The movie was beautifully shot and Carice van Houten is incredible in this movie. Zwartboek is a typical Paul Verhoevenmovie with some nudity and heavy in your facescenes and provocative and unexpected things that happen. Zwartboek could be the winner of the Oscars for foreign movies next year as far as I am concerned. Also a special credit for the German actor who plays general Franken.

	schema:reviewBody "Paul Verhoven isn't ever known so much for subtlety as a director and Black Book doesn't really make any big steps to change that. It is unlike his films from the past dozen or so years not intentionally sleazy or overridden with lots of gruesome carnage. There's even a sense that he's probably quite passionate about making a film loaded with gripping history and lots of 'cinematic' characters not totally real not totally fake either. But it's also one where melodrama reigns over real incisive dramatic skills and unlike the recently rereleased Army of Shadows there's almost an exhausting quality to the twists and turns the core being more about direct audience manipulation as opposed to more subdued theatrics. Not that this is the worst thing a director like Verhoven can do and Black Book is loaded with the kind of entertaining goodies that other directors would shy away from. That it's not a great film like it might think it is is hard to ignore.Carice Van Houten puts in a breakthrough performance breakthrough in that it calls for some greater things for her in Hollywood as a Jewish woman who loses her family during a shooting via the Nazis. She joins up with the resistance and her part in it will be primarily to sleep with enemy to get information. A little implausible? Not quite as it's supposedly based on true events whether it was a Jewish woman sleeping with the enemy or just in the little details of the Dutch resistance is up for argument and soon the story unfolds in doublecrosses and crisscrosses where you're never too sure after a while and after the war ends who's really a good guy or not as for the most part few are. In general Verhoven puts these double crosses which end up making the film slightly bulkier than it needs to be as a cynical but poignant point about loss of trust and all morals in times of war coming to a head. Rachel Ellis Stein Van Houten also falls into what the script entails of her falling in love with the main commanding officer she has to sleep with which is rather circumspect in logical terms.But then again after a while looking at Black Book ironically for it's veneer being that of an oldfashioned good versus evil story things become subversive for a reason. The resistance itself for example is quite corruptible even with its higher ideals of eradicating all of the Nazis the ugly side of which personified in the character of the portly Franken who originally killed Rachel's family and even have a double side to dealing with the Jewish people does one value a Dutchman over a Jew becomes one of the central questions for the resistance fighters. And throughout Verhoven is on top of his game directing scenes strongly with just what is needed for each scene however convoluted and the performances usually right on the money The Lives of Others' Sebastian Koch is a believable Nazi turncoat. It is more often than not a satisfying entry in the filmmaker's career and even a return to form after running out of steam with his big Hollywood scifi productions. That it's also quite shallow and with more than one or two really ridiculous scenes one scenes subtext might be 'is that a gun popping under the bed or are you just happy to see me?' is maybe to be expected considering the track record of the filmmaker.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film last night at the Toronto International Film Festival and enjoyed it quite a bit. I wouldn't describe it as excellent but it's definitely entertaining and my interest never waned despite the nearly 2.5 hour length.The film concerns one young Jewish woman's attempt to stay alive during WWII by any means necessary. Through a series of allegiances which shift with dizzying speed she does whatever she has to do to survive.Without giving away any plot details I'll briefly describe my impressions of the film. The lead actress was great  not only is she stunningly beautiful but she completely made the movie for me. She's very easy on the eyes and proves to be a remarkable actress completely believable and sympathetic.The plot moved along swiftly and never lost momentum although the evershifting loyalties and allegiances became overwhelming after a while. Having said that however the plot did seem a bit predictable and obvious to me a sort of paintbynumbers approach to script writing. I didn't find it very suspenseful although our heroine is such a sympathetic character that I found myself rooting for her throughout wondering how she'd make it through since the film is one long flashback one already knows she'll make it.For a European film it was surprisingly Hollywoodesque with lots of gratuitous violence and nudity  although I didn't mind the nudity. There were a few scenes which seemed particularly gratuitous and unnecessary two words  shit bucket. But luckily these didn't distract too much from the plot.All in all it was an above average movie and well worth seeing if you're a fan of WWII films and don't mind watching a beautiful young woman light up the screen for two hours or so.".

	schema:reviewBody "Black Book may be based on a true story but it often plays more like a corny wartime melodrama than a serious film about war. Suffice it to say it has a lot of beautiful and glamorous people running around doing a lot of cloakanddagger espionage stuff  all while changing the course of history. That's not to say it isn't an enjoyable and entertaining picture just that it doesn't rank up there in artistry and truth with the great European films about the Fascist era classics like Open City Forbidden Games The Shop on Main Street Das Boot etc. When you boil it down to the bare essentials the theme of Black Book seems to be that there's nothing like a little hair coloring and a bar of chocolate to help an attractive young girl survive the horrors of war.Rachel Stein is a beautiful Jewish singer whose entire family is mowed down by the Nazis as they are fleeing occupied Holland Rachel and her family are Germans currently hiding out in the Netherlands. As the sole survivor of the attack Rachel quickly becomes active in the Dutch resistance her assignment being to cozy up to a highranking Gestapo officer who has taken a liking to her. Soon she finds herself not only in bed with the Nazi but quite possibly in love with him as well.Paul Verhoeven has directed the film much in the style of his bigscale Hollywood productions Robocop Total Recall  that is to say with a great deal of energy but not a lot of emotion. The convoluted storyline often becomes muddled and difficult to follow but Verhoeven compensates for this weakness by keeping the proceedings moving at a breakneck pace which is a good thing since the film takes an exhausting two hours and twentyfive minutes to tell its story. Unfortunately the movie has been fitted with a musical score that sounds as if it has been lifted from some thirdrate espionage thriller from the 1960's. Carice van Houten has brio and spunk as the movie's heroine running around from one dire predicament and hairbreadth escape to another  she's almost like a Dutch version of the perpetually imperiled Pauline  but most of the other actors simply get lost in the shuffle. And if you've ever doubted that chocolate is indeed the answer to all of life's problems you will never do so again after seeing this movie.I must say that even though I enjoyed the film immensely Black Book is probably the first serious film about Nazis that actually had me chuckling at wholly inappropriate places some of the actors even hold their guns in a funny way. Black Book may be a Dutch film by rights but it's strictly from Hollywood in its silliness and corn.".

	schema:reviewBody "Paul Verhoeven is a strange breed. He's responsible for three of the most gleefully violent fascist and wildly imaginative scifi thrillers of a now bygone era Robocop Total Recall and Starship Troopers. He's also directed the only commercially successful erotic thriller of the past twenty years Basic Instinct and what is arguably one of the worst films ever made the highly unerotic and campy Showgirls. With Black Book he digs back into his Dutch roots and delivers a thrilling though flawed WWII flick anchored by an amazing lead performance from Carice Van Houten.The first thirty minutes play like a crackerjack version of a surviving the Holocaust epic. Imagine what Hitchcock might have done had he ever tackled the genre and you'll get an idea of just how splendidly Verhoeven starts the film. He begins with the plucky and beguiling Jewish singer Rachel Stein Carice Van Houten hiding out in the Netherlands from the Nazis traversing tragedy after tragedy and escaping by the skin of her teeth due to her own innate will to survive until she becomes embroiled with a terrorist Dutch resistance group plotting against the German occupation. The first third of the film is full of suggestive dark humor crisply shot action set pieces and a luminous Van Houten who throws her whole body into her acting and could melt or kill a man with her smile.The middle portion where Rachel Stein becomes Ellis de Vries and infiltrates the Nazi regime is a stark contrast to its excellent build up. All suggestion is thrown out the door for a crass misogynistic take on the spy genre. It's fun to watch but leaves a bad taste in your mouth. It's also the type of crude sadism that is likely to offend the typical audience for this type of historical drama. Van Houten once again throws her whole body into the role and it's often naked and glowing in this portion of the film. She's immensely watchable as she becomes a pawn in the games of these fascist men hell bent on mutual annihilation. Once driven by her own wits she now must be rescued time and again by the amoral men who have fallen under her spell.All changes when the Allied Forces march into the Netherlands triumphant returning sovereign rule to the bitter Dutch and striking up deals with the crumbling Nazi infrastructure. The fall out from the multiple doublecrossings in the middle portion of the film turn the last third into a pulsating and memorable revenge saga.Ultimately justice is in the eye of the beholder and Verhoeven seems to be saying that all men are capable of evil deeds when their freedom has been taken away and their lives threatened. In his view of war there are no heroes. The only character with any virtue and good sense is a woman and her inherent weakness often leads to pain tragedy and humiliation. It's a troublesome and often fractured view of the world which leads to the film's fracturing into three distinct parts but it's miraculously held together by Carice Van Houten's galvanizing performance that emotionally and physically upstages the worst of what Verhoeven can deliver thematically and visually on any given day.".

	schema:headline " Paul Verhoeven back to his roots.";
	schema:reviewBody "More than 20 years after his last Dutch movie Verhoeven returns to his native country with the movie Zwartboek. Of course expectations were high and people from both the Netherlands and those outside of it who are familiar with his earlier Dutch movies eagerly awaited this movie probably expecting a new Soldaat van Oranje. With all those high anticipations which also must have putted lots of pressure on Verhoeven's shoulders the movie could only disappoint like unfortunately too often is the case by 'hyped' and highly anticipated movies. To most professional Dutch movie critics this movie was a slight disappointment probably expecting way too much of it. Granted that Zwartboek does have its flaws but overall this movie surpassed my expectations mainly since the movie is a well balanced mix of Verhoeven's earlier Dutch work and his later Hollywood works. It provides the movie with an unique and straightforward as ever style with lots of spectacular and entertaining moments and some fine acting. Make sure not to expect a new Soldaat van Oranje like movie and you'll be able to enjoy and be impressed by the movie for what it is.To be honest the movie didn't started off well. The beginning is messy with way too much happening on screen in a too short amount of time. It's unclear were the movie is heading to and what for a kind of movie it is going to be. There isn't a main plot line which doesn't help to make the movie interesting or easy to watch. Luckily the second halve is much better and completely blew me away. I really didn't expected to see so much action and tense and spectacular moments. The movie starts of as a typical Dutch WW II drama but quickly turns into a spectacular actionthriller with moments that really impress.I like Paul Verhoeven movies both his Dutch as his Hollywood movies for several reasons. One of them is that he can always tell a dramatic and powerful story in a heavy impressive but yet also always entertaining way. His movies always have one or multiple messages in it but they are disguised so well into the story also kudos to Gerard Soeteman for that of course that is doesn't ever get distracting or feels overdone and preachy but still it works unconsciously effective and powerful nevertheless. Another reason why I love Verhoeven movies is that he's never afraid to show the dark side of people. Zwartboek teaches us that nothing in this world is completely black and white and not everything and everyone is completely right or wrong good or bad.Despite the movie its beginning the movie is well written with some good and interesting characters in it. The story takes some great thriller kind of twists and turns which also both helps the drama and action moments work out. It has some misses but overall it has way more hits which makes Zwartboek probably not the best Dutch movie since years but certainly the most interesting and surprising one. The fact that the story is completely told from a woman's point of view makes the movie all the more powerful and believable as well as unique and interesting.Had Verhoeven not worked in America for several years this movie would had had a completely different look and style. Verhoeven his 'Hollywood' style can be found back in this movie. Mainly of course in its action but also mostly in its professionalism in terms of directing style camerawork and pacing. Zwarttboek probably is more 'Hollywood' than 'European' in terms of style and storytelling which should mean that persons who aren't familiar with European movies should be able to enjoy this movie as well. Also still Verhoeven's own unique distinctive style in this movie is notable meaning lots of nudity sex and graphic violence but it all serves a purpose and therefor doesn't feel overdone or unneeded.The acting in this movie is topclass from both the Dutch actors as well as the Germans. Every well known and respected Dutch actor stood in line to work with Verhoeven on his first Dutch movie since several decades. Verhoeven gratefully took advantage of this and the movie is filled with some of the best Dutch actors around at the moment. People from the Netherlands already knew it but now the rest of the world also knows that Carice van Houten is one great actress with a great charisma and look. She carries the movie for most of its time and does this in an highly convincing and impressive way. This movie surely means her internationally breakthrough at least if she is up for that. She further more has a great chemistry with basically every of her fellow actors in this movie especially with Sebastian Koch and Halina Reijn. Actors in this movie who were also really good were Thom Hoffman and Derek de Lint and German actors Waldemar Kobus and Christian Berkel. Johnny de Mol however feels out of place and he plays an highly unconvincing character that only works distracting.The movie is really professional and good looking despite its very lowbudget even though its the most expensive Dutch movie ever made. The great cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub gives the movie its own identity and great look. The movie looks especially professional with its action. For some reason action and shoot sequences never look convincing in Dutch movies but this movie is a glorious exception.Will Zwartboek win an Oscar for best foreign film? As much as I want to see Verhoeven finally win an Oscar and get some recognition I don't think it will win. Zwartboek is probably too spectacular and 'Hollywood' for that. I think that the academy would prefer a more heavy drama with a more serious told story that is more powerful than entertaining.More entertaining and impressive than powerful but a fine sweet surprise nevertheless that honestly surpassed my expectations.810".

As seen for one Jewish woman's point of view and what she must do to resist the German occupation. Its a boy's own adventure story and soon we are on an adventure at a fast pace on who is good and who is a traitor. With no Americans in the cast and not an American uniform in sight it allows people to know that others were involved in the war long before help arrived. I hope this movie does well in the USA because it deserves to be. Young men and women will enjoy the chase and love angle with fight scenes throughout the film. So you have to read subtitles well they never spoke English to each other get over it. This war movie should not escape you its fun. Its shot like a Hollywood film like days long gone don't miss it!".

The topic has been treated many times but never I think to such effect.  The last days in the bunker are entirely through the wondering subjective eyes of Werner as Captain Wuest a rather unimportant guardsman.  Hitler and his henchmen are always kept at a distance the way Wuest views them from his station and what stands out in my memory is the finale of a drunken champagne party as though in celebration of something but in reality as their means to forget the impending doom looming ahead as the Russians can be heard closing in.  The problem with films portraying famous or infamous people is that they are almost always unbelievable because we are unwilling to suspend our disbelief aware that they are actors up there trying to imitate the unknowable.  Here at least for the English speaking audience the problem does not arise we understand only through subtitles and we hear the characters speaking in their own language.  And thank God it is in black and white.  The impact of the film stays with me still and of course Werner was a major revelation.".

The American knockoff was a little flat.Few figures have attracted as much attention from the cinema as Adolph.

	schema:reviewBody "Der letzte Akt also known as The Last Act and there are many more titles under which this film can be found is a West German  Austrian coproduction that resulted in a Germanlanguage blackandwhite film from 1955. The director is Georg Wilhelm Pabst one of Germany's most known silent film directors and here we have one of his rare Germanlanguage sound films. The year is 1955 so this one had its 60th anniversary last year. The most famous cast member is probably Oscar nominee Oskar Werner and Albin Skoda plays Adolf Hitler. This also shows you what the movie is about. It should not be a surprise to anybody as so so many Germanlanguage films in the 1950s dealt with coming to terms with what happened in the country one decade earlier. And one decade is very accurate in this case as the film is about the finals days of Hitler's live. It was obvious the war was lost and Hitler came to terms with his own fate and decided to take his own life with everything crumbling around him. In general this is a historic context that I am fairly interested in but I still must say the film did very little for me and it dragged on several occasions. Maybe the novelbased script simply wasn't good enough for a runtime over 90 minutes. That's also why I cannot say I enjoyed the watch very much and give it a thumbs down. I recommend you to watch something else instead unless you really really care for the subject.".

Klaus Kinski plays his henchman a creepy zoo worker and the obvious but more minor villain. The Snake himself however could be any number of people from the colorful cast including a classical musician and society matron who drinks straight whisky for tea time her lovely young niece the niece's fiance the owner of the zoo or perhaps even one of several police officers investigating the bizarre murders.This movie has a few effectively creepy scenes some good comic relief and an effective ending. Still it doesn't compare in my mind to the classics of the krimi genre like Dead Eyes of London nor even to slightly less wellregarded entries like The Mad Executioners The Strangler of Blackmoor Castle and The College Girl Murders. It was directed by Alfred Vohrer who also directed Dead Eyes and two of the three films just mentioned but I wouldn't rank it among his best work. It does feature an early appearance by the late enfante terrible German actor Klaus Kinski who would no doubt dismiss it as another piece of sht but of course he said that about ALL his films. Strangely it doesn't feature Joachim Fuchsberger who was in even in more of these films than Kinski. It does have the goto comic relief actor Eddie Arentt but frankly Inge Langen is a lot more funny as the elderly whiskyswigging society matron.This movie is somewhat overrated in my opinion but definitely worth seeing if you like the krimi genre.".

A criminal known as The Snake is killing witnesses with a gun that shoots snake venom into the victims. The identity of the killer is fairly easy to determine but that is not really the problem. The Squeaker feels talkier than usual and less interesting than some of the best entries in the series. It is however a reasonably entertaining watch though. Fans of the series will appreciate the actors changing up their roles. Series regular Siegfried Schurenberg takes a break from Sir John the Scotland Yard Chief to play a newspaper publisher baffled by his paper always missing the big scoop. This might have something to do with having Eddi Arent take that autocorrect! as a reporter. As good as these actors are the film belongs to Klaus Kinski. The actor appeared in many of these adaptations but he often had a superficial role. Kinski's physical demeanor did not lend itself to casting him as the main villain because the audience would easily guess he was the villain just by looking at him. Thus often Kinski played a sleazy witness that would be bumped off or the villain's henchman which technically he plays in The Squeaker as well. The difference is that in The Squeaker Kinski is given more chance to shine. Almost all of the film's best scenes belong to Kinski from the opening heist of the black mamba to playing with a pet boa constrictor to disposing of an unwanted body to silencing a witness in a clever way to the ending shootout Klaus Kinski owns this film. Fans of the actor should definitely take note.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Sinister Cinema DVD merits a few remarks. Sinister Cinema uses the same template for it's budget packaging the only items that change are the film title and a small frame from the film. The film is transferred to DVDR and usually contains a trailer as one extra bonus. Based on this I was not expecting much regarding the quality of the film transfer. Was I surprised! The transfer is struck from a beautiful widescreen black and white print. It keeps the German language titles and credits which is a nice touch. The audio is up to par with the print quality. The English language dub is also done quite well and does not detract from the original intent of the film. I say that Sinister Cinema's release is miles above the Edgar Wallace films that Something Weird Video is currently releasing. I have several and while the quality is good it pales in comparison to SC's release. Many years ago I was a customer of Sinister Cinema when all they offered were VHS dubs. I remembered getting a copy of Spider Baby from them that also was excellent quality. Glad they haven't changed. Based upon this experience I have ordered 6 more Edgar Wallace films and can't wait to see them. Check out their website for some incredible catalog titles. I plan on backfilling my collection with more of these hard to find items.".

	schema:reviewBody "Der Zinker or The Squeaker is a coproduction between West Germany and France that resulted in a Germanlanguage movie from 1963 which means this one is already more than half a century old. As such it is of course a blackandwhite film but it has sound. The director is Alfred Vohrer and just like his writer Harald G. Petersson he was among the best and most successful of his profession here in Germany back in the day. There were two big film series in West Germany and the duo worked on both of them. One would be western movies WinnetouOS the other would be Edgar Wallace adaptations and while I personally do not really see much appeal or quality in either I can somehow see why people lied these back then. In my opinion both have not aged well at all. Now here we have a Wallace adaptation of course at slightly over minutes one of the shorter but still one of the most known. Nonetheless I found the watch pretty weak. It's the same problem as always with these. The comedy keeps while occasionally not bad keeps the drama and thriller and most of all crime aspects from getting you to the edge of your seat as it kinda hurts the atmosphere. And the actual writing of the crime story is also weak as usual. Plot twists and occurrences come out of nowhere so we can suspect everybody at least once until the final revelation happens. I like Heinz Drache and I think he is very charismatic and has decent range but he is clearly limited by the writing here. Same goes for Klaus Kinski who once again plays something similar to a scapegoat even if his character is probably more sinister in this film than he usually is. Still he feels almost always the same in these Wallace films. Overall it just isn't a good crime movie. I must say I had little to no interest in finding out the identity of the killer at the end and this is of course a negative dealbreaker. Watch something else instead.".

They are reluctant to tell anyone not only of their want to get married but of their relationship. Genevive believes her mother will think her too young and would want her to marry someone with better prospects especially considering her own tenuous financial situation. And Guy is more concerned now about not abandoning his ailing godmother Aunt lise who raised him and who he looks after along with a young woman named Madeleine. Act 2 told largely from Genevive's perspective begins in February 1958. Guy drafted to fight for the French in Algeria has been gone for two months and is expected to be gone for two years.

But the film knows this  in the very first scene the men in the washroom joke about Carmen another example of the same style and one of them sings something like I'm going to see a film I don't like Opera I can't stand all the singing. Its a film that knows mechanics don't usually sing arias while they check the oil and makes a joke about it. Buffy fans will have got the same point from Once more with feeling  the Fundamental Problem of the Musical is why is everybody singing?But there is something unrealistic about it the beauty. Everyone and everything is goodlooking. The people are beautiful. The dirty old town is beautiful. Cheap bars are beautiful. Squalid damp flats are beautiful. Abandoned hulk ships are beautiful. A garage forecourt with petrol pumps and a canopy is beautiful. All the men are goodlooking. And as for the women  someone asked why more men than women like this weepy film. The obvious answer is Catherine Deneuve. But Anne Vernon playing her mother is cuter than anyone her age has a right to be. And as for Ellen Farner... Guy has not one but two stupendously attractive women after him which is about 1.99 more than the average member of the audience.The costumes match the background far too often for it to be anything but deliberate.

Genevieve stands in front of a window while a truck that's exactly the same shade as her cardigan pulls up behind her.

We are in fantasy land here even if it looks a little like Cherbourg. but this is all the same as the singing. To ask how does a poor family afford such clothes? or why is the delivery van exactly that shade of yellow? is to miss the point as much as to ask why does a shopkeeper sing to his customers? or why does it always rain when we say goodbye?. In this movie in this fantasy land the world is turned upside down the meek can inherit the earth or at least look as if they might smalltown Cherbourg is as romantic as Paris sailors and truckdrivers sing while they work the poor wear clothes that money can't buy the scenery changes colour to match your wardrobe every man looks like a leading man and every shopgirl truly is as beautiful as any duchess. This is Singing in the Rain set in the backroom of a shop instead of the back lot of a Hollywood studio this is West Side Story without the violence this is a smalltown Moulin Rouge this is Brief Encounter on acid.It's not a tragic ending any more than the endings of Casablanca or Brief Encounter are tragic. It's the right ending. We're not so much sad for Genevieve  even though we are crying  as we are happy for Roland who deserves a break. Even though we know he's probably a crook If we are crying its because Guy needs to hug Francoise. We expect that the marriages will work out in the end  maybe they have worked out already. If these people are not going to be happy its not because they married the wrong partners. and what other film has had hundreds of thousands of viewers in floods of tears watching an aerial shot of an Esso service station?".

	schema:reviewBody "Maybe not. Les Parapluies de Cherbourg is one of the most beautiful movies ever made with an enchanting and haunting score by Michel Le Grande and totally focused sharp and creative direction by Jacques Demy. Catherine Deneuve gives a fine performance in pinkish white makeup with her blonde hair pulled away from her famous face at twenty playing a seventeenyearold shopkeeper's daughter who falls in love with a garage mechanic. He is called away to the war in Algeria after making her pregnant. Will she wait for him as the awardwinning song proclaims? Will their love endure the long separation?All the dialogue is sung. The script is terse with nothing extraneous to the bittersweet story. Because the dialogue is stripped to the barest essentials the singing seems natural and enhances the dreamlike quality established early with the rain falling on the umbrellas and the cobblestone streets of the seacoast town. The sets are splashed in vivid color. Everything is superficially romantic but the events are the starkest realism.When a young girl if forced to choose between love and security which does she choose? It depends on the circumstances and sometimes circumstances and the passage of time can change her heart.I was a teenager in France when this was made in the sixties. The backdrops of the white Esso gas station the red and yellow passenger train cars the bouffant hair styles on the girls their eyes heavily made up with mascara and black eyeliner the ubiquitous bicycles and the little French cigarette roller cars all brought back vivid memories of youth as did the musical score. A question what ever happened to the other girl Ellen Farner who played Madeleine? To be honest I found her more attractive than Deneuve who of course went on to become a great star and an acclaimed international beauty.Farner was never heard from again.Some scenes made more effective by their simplicity When Genevire Deneuve returns home after a late evening with Guy her mother Anne Vernon surveys her daughter and exclaims What have you done? Genevire retorts sharply Mama! and it is clear what she has done. Also as Guy is going off to the army Madeleine arrives upon the scene as he is saying goodbye to his stepmother who is ill. They exchange glances that reveal Madeleine's love for him. And then she sings out softly in the heartfelt regret of parting Adieu Guy. We know these are not the last words that will pass between them. Additionally the brief beautifully structured final scene at the shiny new Esso gas station is not to be forgotten.The scenes with Roland Cassard Marc Michel the suave traveling man of means who sells Madame Emery's jewelry so she can pay the taxes on her umbrella shop are nicely staged so that we can see at a glance that he is enormously taken with Genevire and that the mother will do everything possible to further his case. It is agreeable for those identifying with Genevire that Roland is not only well off financially but is as handsome as the garage mechanic. But will he still want her when he learns that she is pregnant with another man's child?Jacques Demy who also wrote the script is to be commended for the effortless pace and tight focus of this romantic tale of star crossed lovers. I wish every director had such an ability to cut the extraneous and concentrate on the essentials without intrusion. The tale is an atmospheric tour de force of love lost and gained of bourgeois values triumphant.This might be a bit precious for some but upon seeing this for the third time I can tell you I was enchanted anew.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

Catherine Deneuve gives a fine performance in pinkish white makeup with her blonde hair pulled away from her famous face at twenty playing a seventeenyearold shopkeeper's daughter who falls in love with a garage mechanic. He is called away to the war in Algeria after making her pregnant. Will she wait for him as the awardwinning song proclaims? Will their love endure the long separation?All the dialogue is sung. The script is terse with nothing extraneous to the bittersweet story. Because the dialogue is stripped to the barest essentials the singing seems natural and enhances the dreamlike quality established early with the rain falling on the umbrellas and the cobblestone streets of the seacoast town. The sets are splashed in vivid color. Everything is superficially romantic but the events are the starkest realism.When a young girl if forced to choose between love and security which does she choose? It depends on the circumstances and sometimes circumstances and the passage of time can change her heart.I was a teenager in France when this was made in the sixties. The backdrops of the white Esso gas station the red and yellow passenger train cars the bouffant hair styles on the girls their eyes heavily made up with mascara and black eyeliner the ubiquitous bicycles and the little French cigarette roller cars all brought back vivid memories of youth as did the musical score. A question what ever happened to the other girl Ellen Farner who played Madeleine? To be honest I found her more attractive than Deneuve who of course went on to become a great star and an acclaimed international beauty.Farner was never heard from again.Some scenes made more effective by their simplicity When Genevire Deneuve returns home after a late evening with Guy her mother Anne Vernon surveys her daughter and exclaims What have you done? Genevire retorts sharply Mama! and it is clear what she has done. Also as Guy is going off to the army Madeleine arrives upon the scene as he is saying goodbye to his stepmother who is ill. They exchange glances that reveal Madeleine's love for him. And then she sings out softly in the heartfelt regret of parting Adieu Guy. We know these are not the last words that will pass between them. Additionally the brief beautifully structured final scene at the shiny new Esso gas station is not to be forgotten.The scenes with Roland Cassard Marc Michel the suave traveling man of means who sells Madame Emery's jewelry so she can pay the taxes on her umbrella shop are nicely staged so that we can see at a glance that he is enormously taken with Genevire and that the mother will do everything possible to further his case. It is agreeable for those identifying with Genevire that Roland is not only well off financially but is as handsome as the garage mechanic. But will he still want her when he learns that she is pregnant with another man's child?Jacques Demy who also wrote the script is to be commended for the effortless pace and tight focus of this romantic tale of star crossed lovers. I wish every director had such an ability to cut the extraneous and concentrate on the essentials without intrusion. The tale is an atmospheric tour de force of love lost and gained of bourgeois values triumphant.This might be a bit precious for some but upon seeing this for the third time I can tell you I was enchanted anew.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!";

I loved the fact that every word was sung but it was not like opera at all.  After a few minutes it was as if every word is always sung and talking doesn't exist.

The film is quite heartbreaking because Genevieve Catherine Deneuve did not persevere in her love for Guy. I can only imagine what pain Guy had to bear facing war in Algeria knowing his fiance back home was pregnant with his child and he couldn't do anything about it. The blaze of colors in the movie was a contrast to the somber atmosphere of infidelity and lost love. I suppose they both had fairly good marriages but we can gleam that they did not reach the pinnacle of joy and had to settle for second best in the end. It sort of reminded me of Elia Kazan's Splendor in the GrassWarren Beatty's character and Natalie Wood's characterthey did not live happily ever afterthey just settled for second best. It is very clear that Genevieve continued to carry the memory of her lost loveotherwise she would not have made the detour to Cherbourg and meet Guy accidentally...It was such a heartbreaking scenethey meet each other after many many years and they have named their children with the same namethe name they planned to give their firstborn as they made their future plans together before he leaves for his army stint.

The versechorus format of popular music and the musical genre is eschewed for an approach more resembling a modern opera as the characters croon their lines to each other over a continuous score. This gives the most banal of lines a rhythm and cadence of their own. Because of this I found the French a lot easier to understand than with more naturalistic films which was fairly handy for me as the print I was watching was with Dutch subtitles! I must confess I did find that the music written by Michel Legrand began to grate towards the end of the 87 minute running time but even so there is still much to admire here. Visually it's stunning with a bold and vibrant colour palette of almost hallucinogenic intensity and sumptuous costume and set design that wallpaper!. The opening credit sequence sets the mood perfectly a birds eye view of the inhabitants of Cherbourg in the rain beneath their umbrellas as they walk across the frame is reduced to a colourful abstraction. Catherine Deneuve is predictably gorgeous and the first act of the young couples courtship is one of the most beautifully pure pieces of cinema I can think of. It reminded me a bit of 'Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris' a film which I saw in television a long time ago and would do absolutely anything to get hold of a copy. 'Les Parapluies de Cherbourg' is a wonderful sincere and uplifting film that everyone should go and see at least once and preferably on a big screen. Once seen never forgotten.".

	schema:headline " Bold Series of Uninterrupted Recitatives Constitute Demy's Brightly Colored But Sad Love Story";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1964 filmmaker Jacques Demy made an audacious move by directing a deceptively simple love story completely in song. I would be hard pressed to call this movie a musical opera or even an operetta since there are neither showstopping production numbers nor soulbearing arias on the soundtrack. Instead we are presented everyday dialogue in a series of recitatives that bring a dramatic urgency to the most mundane of events. Why it works is that the story is not the happygolucky romance one would suspect it will be from the bright colors of the production but rather a melancholy tale of love unfulfilled and the tenuousness of longing in the face of harsh realities. It is a Gallic version of Romeo and Juliet by way of William Inge's tale of teenage lust Splendor in the Grass in fact Demy's ending bears a striking resemblance to the last scenes of Elia Kazan's film three years earlier.The plot focuses on teenaged starcrossed lovers Genevieve and Guy who develop a relationship through clandestine meetings despite the disapproval of Genevieve's mother who thinks a gas station mechanic is beneath her daughter. The lovers eventually consummate their relationship once Guy finds he has been drafted to serve for France during the Algerian conflict. With Guy away Genevieve discovers she is pregnant and must decide whether to wait for Guy's uncertain return or marry the rich diamond dealer Roland Cassard her mother's preference given the failing business of her umbrella shop. The story develops in subtle strokes almost like a Yasujiro Ozu film in that there aren't really any melodramatic confrontation scenes but instead moments of revelation. The wondrous Catherine Deneuve all of twenty had her first important role as Genevieve and it's no wonder her career seems assured from her ethereal performance. With his earthy good looks and openhearted manner Nino Castelnuovo complements Deneuve as Guy and their romance is palpable even in an amusingly contrived shot where they are obviously on a conveyor belt moving down the street. Anne Vernon lends a robust presence as Genevieve's mother as she plots her daughter's fate and Marc Michel is appropriately bland as Roland.Along with the vibrant colors faithfully recaptured in a 1996 restoration such artifices really add to the film's charm. However just as essential is Michel Legrand's score with his swooning romanticism at its most cinematic and a precursor to the music he composed for Barbra Streisand's 1983 Yentl as it fills the dramatic arcs from start to finish. You will likely recognize the lounge standard melodies for the Americanized translations I Will Wait for You and Watch What Happens as they are pervasive through the recitatives. I enjoyed the movie very much but realize this will not be everyone's cup of tea especially those already alienated by the musical genre. One can see this as an even more exaggerated form but you can probably tell by the first two minutes whether you will be enraptured by it. The DVD also includes an excerpt from Demy's widow Agnes Varda's illuminating 1995 documentary The World of Jacques Demy.".

	onyx:emotionText "In 1964 filmmaker Jacques Demy made an audacious move by directing a deceptively simple love story completely in song. I would be hard pressed to call this movie a musical opera or even an operetta since there are neither showstopping production numbers nor soulbearing arias on the soundtrack. Instead we are presented everyday dialogue in a series of recitatives that bring a dramatic urgency to the most mundane of events. Why it works is that the story is not the happygolucky romance one would suspect it will be from the bright colors of the production but rather a melancholy tale of love unfulfilled and the tenuousness of longing in the face of harsh realities. It is a Gallic version of Romeo and Juliet by way of William Inge's tale of teenage lust Splendor in the Grass in fact Demy's ending bears a striking resemblance to the last scenes of Elia Kazan's film three years earlier.The plot focuses on teenaged starcrossed lovers Genevieve and Guy who develop a relationship through clandestine meetings despite the disapproval of Genevieve's mother who thinks a gas station mechanic is beneath her daughter.

The one thing I picked up from that partial viewing was that this movie was unique.Years later I gave Umbrellas a second chance...knowing what I was in store for. Once I got past that 'god this is silly' feeling the movie started to grow on me. The movie kind of meanders with trite situations almost setting the story up for three peak moments SPOILERS The first masterpiece scene is of course I Will Wait For You. The song is beautiful and by this time in the movie you're perfectly willing to accept the fact that the couple can 'glide' down the street...they don't need to walk they're in love.The second great scene is the closing of Act One at the Train Station. I love the fact that it's short and without the overkill Shakespearian dialog. My Love and I love you...simple and painful.The ending of this movie may very well be the best ending to a movie ever. Part of it's brilliance is that it just comes out from nowhere...December 1963 is the only warning. It looks like another random scene at the gas station then a car rolls up and that familiar music begins to play it's like the music to Jaws...you just know something is about to happen. The tension is as thick as any war or action movie...I mean just the guy asking what type of gas she wanted was stressful. It's perfect probably because it seems so real and they're still singing that crazy dialog. This movie is not for all taste. But if you can get into it it's magic. I've seen the movie now over 10 times...it's sickening how it grows on you.".

	schema:reviewBody "The umbrellas of Cheurborg is an very unusual musical. They're is no dancing or talking. I enjoyed the singing and melody.I think it's interesting that they never stop singing because it probably is fairly difficult and needs a lot of talent. And that's what they indeed have! The singing becomes so natural that you even stop thinking about it! I was surprised to hear someone talk after the movie. Also the colors are extremely bright. Especially the pink wallpapers in the heroines house and her green dress she wears in the beginning. It's also interesting how it starts with the hero then switches to the heroine and ends with the hero. Catherine Deneuve has a charming charisma and is a real treasure. She and Nino Castelnuovo have a nice chemistry which makes the film successful in the romantic elements. The heroine's mother is a typical way of portraying parents in films but Anne Vernon pulls it of so well that it didn't bother me at all. All characters are believable and even the end is realistic. I won't tell you how it ends but believe me it ain't no stupid Hollywood ending! Everyone I know have dedated whether the endings sad or not personally I don't think so. I have to also say the translation is perfect! I have come across a few fairly awful ones so it was a pleasant surprise to see that they had really tried with this one. The directer Jacques Demy impressed me with his brilliant superb moving writings and directions. He has created one of the most beautiful love stories. And I just don't like any romance stories so believe me this one works perfectly! It's also one of the most spectacular musicals. It a movie everyone should see from youngsters to adults.".

I went with my best friend the film was recommended to us by my friends mother. She talked about how the dialogue was all singing. We thought that sounded weird but we went anyway. I remember that I was truly moved by this movie. I remember that I thought the singing dialogue was weird at first but after a very short while it appeared natural and I didn't think about it anymore. I remember that I was truly in love with the lovely Catherine Deneuve. I remember that her choices and her fate was not wrong. It was only sad. I remember how the wonderful tune of the main character touched my heart and stayed with me ever since.I only saw the movie again a few days ago. So many films from the 50's and 60's loose their magic when you see them again after many years. Not so with Les Parapluies de Cherbourg! The dialogue is not quaint like so often felt. Perhaps the singing dialogue keeps it forever young. The words ring true and fresh like ever. The dilemma of love and life is present as a real and forever relevant question. The acting is subtle and discrete underplayed almost free of theatrical overacting and dramatization. The music is amazing. Les Parapluis de Cherbourg is a truly timeless moving and worthwhile masterpiece. A true gem. Watch this movie with someone you love.".

	schema:reviewBody "What can I say this is one of the most magical and beautiful films I've ever seen. It does sound a bit silly at the beginning with all that singing in the garage but then it just takes over you entirely. A word of warning though don't watch it with your girlfriend. Because sorry but it is not about her it is about the past. About things that were happening once that were so great while they lasted but that did not last long. That you want to forget and yet don't want to forget. If you were ever young and full of love and then the world collapsed and yet you now feel masochistic enough to actually want to relive every single moment of it then this film is for you.What amazes me most is that this film is actually so incredibly simple. Despite all the singing there is no high poetry dying of love pompous gestures and all that stuff. But that's precisely what gets you what makes it so true and so how it actually happens. You just come and she is gone and then nothing makes sense any more. End of the world is actually amazingly simple the world just ends.And about what happened to the Guy next. One might say that he moved on too soon. But I can tell you that the most unbearable thing at this stage is not having someone next to you. When it used to fill all your life and now there is just void it is simply beyond what you can comprehend or live with.And the finale! Wow. And again there are hardly a few words there How are you  fine. Yet that's exactly how it happens. You want to say so much you want to bring it back all over again. And yet you don't want it you know that it won't do anybody any good and it won't really happen. You cannot walk into the same river twice. The river is not the same and you are not the same.And I haven't even mentioned the music. Which is absolutely magical. And again did I mention it it is so simple yet it completely blows you away. It pours with rain with snow with sunshine. It promises it worries it straggles it swipes with all the rain and sadness it brings the past back. Every time you hear those accords it just brings the tears to your eyes.It is so sad and yet so beautiful.".

It does sound a bit silly at the beginning with all that singing in the garage but then it just takes over you entirely. A word of warning though don't watch it with your girlfriend. Because sorry but it is not about her it is about the past. About things that were happening once that were so great while they lasted but that did not last long. That you want to forget and yet don't want to forget. If you were ever young and full of love and then the world collapsed and yet you now feel masochistic enough to actually want to relive every single moment of it then this film is for you.What amazes me most is that this film is actually so incredibly simple. Despite all the singing there is no high poetry dying of love pompous gestures and all that stuff. But that's precisely what gets you what makes it so true and so how it actually happens. You just come and she is gone and then nothing makes sense any more. End of the world is actually amazingly simple the world just ends.And about what happened to the Guy next. One might say that he moved on too soon. But I can tell you that the most unbearable thing at this stage is not having someone next to you. When it used to fill all your life and now there is just void it is simply beyond what you can comprehend or live with.And the finale! Wow. And again there are hardly a few words there How are you  fine. Yet that's exactly how it happens. You want to say so much you want to bring it back all over again. And yet you don't want it you know that it won't do anybody any good and it won't really happen. You cannot walk into the same river twice. The river is not the same and you are not the same.And I haven't even mentioned the music. Which is absolutely magical. And again did I mention it it is so simple yet it completely blows you away. It pours with rain with snow with sunshine. It promises it worries it straggles it swipes with all the rain and sadness it brings the past back. Every time you hear those accords it just brings the tears to your eyes.It is so sad and yet so beautiful.";

Seldom do I find myself actually holding my breath at such beauty but that's what happened. The restoration was astonishing and the years slipped away and the audience was there in 1964.  The accolades awarded this remarkable achievement have been duly expressed. I can only concur and sing this film's praises too.  It is a oneofakind work with all elements of the production uniting into a masterpiece.Legrand's score weaves its throughcomposed themes utilizing leitmotifs recurring patterns Faurelike harmonic designs and structural forms into a hypnotic flow.  His recitatives are perfectly blended into the rich texture and move naturally and beautifully recalling such ingenious French opera realizations as Bizet.  Yet Legrand's main songs are likewise woven into the score like ariashaunting in their simplicity and sweetness.  The singers on the soundtrack are excellent and the choice of actors to match the vocal work is done to perfection.  Nowhere in the annals of cinema can one find a work like this lovely creation.  Thanks to the painstaking task of restoration all can once again thrill to the original French version of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.".

At several points in the film he reminded me of a young Christian Slater the Slater who used to pour everything he had into a role.Kudos also to Shaun Sipos who oddly enough reminded me of a young Brad Pitt from Twelve Monkeys especially in the chicken restaurant scene with Fletcher. I hope both these guys get much more acting work as a result of what they accomplished in Rampage.My only question is how on earth did Uwe Boll pull this brilliant movie out of his ass after a career full of crap I wouldn't want my worst enemy to have to watch? In any event this film as shocking as it is is a warning that the worst is yet to come.

Granted there were some problems but most films have problems and compared to the complete trash he's produced in years past this was his Shawshank Redemption. Brendan Fletcher really keeps this movie up and his eerily dopey presence adds all the more to the ensuing violence. Smart but not too smart somewhat believable. One scene however stands heads and shoulders above the rest and it involves old people and bingo. enough said. Thoroughly enjoyable not too much film school editing and slick over all.

It's basically just a frustrated young guy who's kind of a loser in the eyes of his small town who straps on a suit of full body armor grabs some serious firepower and mows down everyone he sees mostly. I'd love to tell you that it's a serious look at the troubled mind of a small town guy who's pushed over the edge but it's really not. It is however still quite good. Some people will probably get tired of a guy walking through town shooting random people but I think it serves it's purpose to further the story and isn't completely mindless killing.

Uwe Boll played his cards well in this movie and delivered somewhat of a social and political heavy set movie here.The acting was sparse and wasn't really needed in a movie of this type. But the lead role played by Brendan Fletcher was remarkable. He put on a stunning performance with his psycho role.Now the only thing that kind of irritated me in this movie was the handheld camera stuff. That was horrible. Had Uwe Boll decided to go with a steady cam instead the movie would have been just that much more cool. Sure handheld cams are nice as well but it was just a tad too much in this movie. Every single shot was shaking back and forth often to a degree where you started to pull your hair and scream keep it still for the love of Hollywood gods! But looking past the camera issue then this movie rocked phenomenally.This is most definitely a movie to check out. It is packed with action and at the same time taking on the gloves to punch our sick society in the face.".

However Boll managed to minimize his annoying directorial habits to an acceptable level and create a good movie with its own style. The movie shocks with its nihilistic sensibility and I think it is a biggest sign of the theme being treated in a nonstereotypical way. This movie has a very nonpretentious style but actually I think it treats the subject matter of mass murder more nonstereotypically then a more highbrow movie like Elephant.The actors are good especially Brendan Fletcher who plays the everyman psycho protagonists reminds me of young Christian Slater.

	schema:reviewBody "This film will appeal to those looking for wanton violence presented in a stylish and arresting though slightly repetitive manner. It will not appeal to those who want their entertainment to have socially redeeming value. It will make physically ill those who suffer from motion sickness when they see too much jerky handheld video. In all honesty I lean more toward the first group than the second but am a card carrying member of the third. Which means I would have liked Rampage if it hadn't left me with a headache and lowgrade nausea.Bill Brendan Fletcher is a rather diminutive 20something loser who still lives at home with his mom and dad Lynda Boyd and Matt Frewer. He has one anticorporate hipster friend Shaun Sipos no girlfriend no prospects and a single ambition. Bill wants to don a homemade suit of combat armor and go on a killing spree. And that's exactly what he does. The bulk of Rampage consists of Bill shooting stabbing and blowing up enough people to make a 1980s action movie green with envy.Now if you're unfamiliar with Uwe Boll he has a reputation as an infamously terrible filmmaker. I mean we're talking torturously bad cinema that people with any sense turn off before it's even halfway over. However while you might consider Boll a moral degenerate after watching this movie there's little here that would make you question his talent or skill. The way Rampage has been shot and edited is powerfully evocative as Boll puts you side by side with a small man on his journey into great evil. Boll doesn't do much to explain who Bill is but impressively envelops the viewer with the malignant thoughts and feelings running through him. One of the best ways Boll does that is during scenes where Bill is alone and while the audience is looking at him what they hear is a rushing stream of voices that sound like snippets of talk shows and news reports. The torrent of soundbites cover the gamut of social political and economic dysfunction and the dark disjointed atmosphere they create is an unpleasant place to be but that's what it must be like to be inside the head of one of these mass murderers.Visually Boll builds up to Bill's killing frenzy with flashes of random chaos that are a bit confusing until you realize that Bill is imaging what he's going to be doing. And after Bill blows up a police station Boll keeps the camera almost relentlessly focused on Bill and his perspective as he murders person after person after person. Neither the police nor any of his innocent victims are allowed to be more than meat sacks waiting for Bill to perforate them. That simultaneously plunges you into the violence in a very vicarious way while denying most of its emotional impact. When Bill machine guns a hair salon full of women as they all huddle together what's most striking about it is not the horror of the act. It's the disgusting banality of it.Now Rampage is less than an hour and a half long but the near constant camera movement made me start to feel ill before it was half over and an awful lot of the dialog sounds like it was the result of poor improvisation. But the faux documentary style actually helped counteract such fumbling interaction with the illusion of verisimilitude. When a film looks like this you don't expect the people to sound all that clever or intelligent. Given Boll's track record that's more likely a happy accident than a deliberate design.It must be admitted that completely reasonable people could look at Rampage and consider it nihilistic garbage. For all its flair The movie isn't much more than See Bill. See Bill slaughter. See Bill get away with it. There's a definite pornographic vibe to it as though the violence were the equivalent of softcore erotica. Imagine one of those late night Skinemax flicks but better made and instead of people taking off their clothes and having sex a maniac guns people down in the street. Even when it's done well there's something a little skeevy about admitting you enjoyed watching it.Boll's use of shakycam did make me queasy but I don't think the film would have worked without it so I can't hold that against him. If you couldn't take The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield you won't be able to stand Rampage. With a stronger stomach and flexible moral standards you might be rather impressed with it. Even if you are though you probably shouldn't take it as a sign to seek more of Boll's work.Just trust me on that.".

There's a definite pornographic vibe to it as though the violence were the equivalent of softcore erotica. Imagine one of those late night Skinemax flicks but better made and instead of people taking off their clothes and having sex a maniac guns people down in the street. Even when it's done well there's something a little skeevy about admitting you enjoyed watching it.Boll's use of shakycam did make me queasy but I don't think the film would have worked without it so I can't hold that against him. If you couldn't take The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield you won't be able to stand Rampage. With a stronger stomach and flexible moral standards you might be rather impressed with it. Even if you are though you probably shouldn't take it as a sign to seek more of Boll's work.Just trust me on that.";

	schema:headline " Uwe Boll's best film by a LONG shot.";
	schema:reviewBody "If it wasn't for IMDb I wouldn't have heard or seen this movie in the first place.Uwe Boll has already made a name for himself as the Ed Wood Of The New Millennium. I agree with that statement for I had to endure House Of The Dead Alone In The Dark Bloodrayne even being a fan of Jason Statham won't save you from In The Name Of The King. Those were just jawdropping shockingly awful films. And the more famous stars Uwe gets the more crappier his movie becomes. Then came along this gem.At which point I urge you to forget not forgive everything you know about Uwe Boll and watch this film with an open mind. This disturbing thriller packed with social commentary is not only Uwe Boll's best film but also one of the best films of the year. I can't believe that I'm saying Uwe Boll and best of the year in the same sentence. But hear me out before you start flaming.First we have a simple story. Just a young kid who gets frustrated and decides to mow down half of his town. Falling Down perhaps? Not exactly. For we get a very interesting main character who spites the condition of the world today and decides to clean up the planet one small step at a time beginning with massacring the town where he lives. This character Bill is played to perfection by relatively fresh Canadian face Brendan Fletcher whom deserved an Oscar nomination in my opinion. However it sadly didn't and wouldn't happen since Uwe Boll's name and reputation destroyed any chances of this film getting an Oscar nomination.While Fletcher acts his role with ease and focus Boll directs the film especially the action sequences with his usual frenetic directing style seen in his previous movies. Back then those were just merely miserable attempts to pull the audience into the action. Now it works with brutal and unflinching force. The cinematography and music have also improved considering these are some of the same crew that worked with Boll in some of his debacles and the production design is somewhat slick a feat if you take the film's low budget into account.Yes the film has it's flaws   some repetitive editing some dodgy and obvious CGI in one scene and the actress playing Bill's mom giving a mediocre performance but the film has a message to tell us and with that purpose alone Boll has succeeded brilliantly. It's as if Boll was reflecting upon gamers' affection towards video games and violent ones to boot. Remember video game fans are the ones who especially hate Boll's guts. Boll shoots the violent scenes where people mostly innocents get shot down mercilessly something commonly seen in games like GTA Hitman and Call of Duty. I couldn't play Hitman for two weeks after watching this film for it made me think whether we are like Bill or Bill is like us. Boll also puts in some neat drifts of social commentary within the movie making us think about those other reallife massacres.So in short well done Boll. I'm amazed that he can pull off a magic trick after so much crap from him... I won't forgive him yet for those four video game atrocities of films but it's interesting to see where he goes to from here... that Darfur movie looks intriguing...Goodness... I'm awaiting Uwe Boll's next movie... isn't that insane?Overall value 7410".

The story is that of a disillusioned 23 yearold old that decides to kill everyone he can. The first 20 minutes are burdened by obvious topical writing a sad attempt at having the audience understand the killer's motives. The weird thing about the beginning is it flashforwards to the rest of the film as we get to know the lead. This completely ruins any sense of mystery or surprise and renders our hero entirely one dimensional from the first frame. The film grows more video gamelike as it goes with people continuously running in front the gunman even though his gunshots can be heard blocks away. The scenes get more and more contrived as the movie progresses. I made it all the way to the bank scene before the gratuitous garbage became so unbearable I had to stop. The only good thing about this movie is the main actor the guy is good. I'd seen him before in a film a 1000 times better Terry Gilliams Tideland. Do yourself a massive favor and watch that and not this offensive bad excuse for entertainment. Unless of course you are a dumb teenager that plays video games hates the world and jerks off a lot.".

But you're not you are as a matter of fact also a slightly evil man too. This in all complete honesty is a true contender for one of the worst films of all time. The plot follows a pastyfaced Brendan Fletcher annoyed with the ENTIRE population of the world because he gets a subpar coffee poor little lamb his boss is unappreciative of his labour as opposed to what exactly? and his parents want him to go back to college the bastards!. I just don't get it what is his problem? Whatever it is I very much doubt idiot Boll is the man to explain it. So what follows is a combination of implausibility his purposebuilt homemade bulletproof suit more or less appears out of thin air. Which begs the question Why didn't he go the whole hog and build a jetpack to go with it or a jettank? awful super shaky cam direction and a morally repugnant concept that if anything is even more awful and nasty than it first sounds. Who the hell is this movie for? Not action fans as the action parts are just plain horrible to watch and utterly tasteless in the worst possible sense. Not horror fans either as this has zero tension throughout as you know exactly what's coming through Mr Boll himself ruining the ending only about 5 mins in. Above all though it's just such a joyless flat nasty piece of work that doesn't even pass as a failed satire on messed up American kids with guns as it's not even remotely trying to be a satire it's nothing besides Boll's own personal fetishisation of a taboo and sensitive subject. There's movies I love movies I think are badgood and then there are movies I actually hate. This is one of them. A terrible terrible example of lowend attention hungry crap cinema.".

I live next to Finland so I thought I could get an adrenalin rush from this film. I was disappointed.The biggest letdown was the camera. The movie is shot in super deluxe shaky cam mode as if Uwe decided to cut as much expenses as possible on the camera crew. Not once did I see an active scene with a clear use of a tripod. This degraded a pro directed movie to a cinema graduate amateur film. It would get more points for being low budget if it didn't have the shakes. Also replacing some of the more intense street shootings with closeups of the guys face wile he breathes heavily was just engagingly pathetic directing. So this kid assembles a reinforced riot suit builds a remote controlled car bomb and gets some guns all through his friends postbox. Later he frames his friend for all his doings and gets out of town. In between we get a rampage complete with one mega cgi explosion. Unfortunately that simplicity is only half the movie.The other half is useless attachment attempts to characters and expanding motivations stretched out with pointless scenes hurtful stupidity and annoying dialogs. No one in this movie was likable or real won't blame them for not trying. When the slaughter began I couldn't care less what happened to anybody. People ran out in front of the maniac instead of hiding in an alley or something. Some didn't even care that a murderer was on a killing spree right next to them. The cops were THE worst portrayal of law enforcers I had ever seen. And in the end the kid got lucky far too many times. Not one camera caught his face when he took off the helmet.The completely unnecessary beginning was jumpy poor slow and ruined the mood for the rest of the movie. The riot suit was just some thin black plate mail not fit to stop a real life bullet. And in the end the father of the framed friend for some reason knew exactly who did it when he was dragged away. Also the kids parents acted like morons when they found out that their kids friend slaughtered half the town. With parents like that I wondered how he even got his lazy head to do all the stuff he did.So in the end I was bored out of my scull on how implausible this low grade rampage was even though it had a low budget and almost no cgi. If you think this film is good than you are desperate.".

It's a far cry from a movie I'd want to watch.Uwe has taken the art out of film making and is obviously trying to make something sensationalistic just to make a quick profit. Instead of Uwe Boll suing spamigation people for downloading his movies maybe he should make one that people would pay for at the box office. Lets all sue for our ticket price.";

The film follows Bill Williamson Brendan Fletcher an isolated 23 year old still living with his parents. Bill has extreme views on how to control the world's population which he believes is at it's capacity. These extreme views lead Bill to construct a bulletproof armour suit purchase automatic weapons and arm a van with explosives. Bill uses the van to blow up the towns police department. With law enforcement temporarily out of the picture Bill casually walks down the street killing everyone in his sights including women and the elderly. Bill seems to be exacting out his own form of population controlnot caring about anything other than getting the job done which he proves by robbing a bank and than burning the money. The film ends with an unexpected twist which makes you realize how clever and intelligent Bill really is and how much of his actions were on purpose and planned.The acting in Rampage is great Brendan Fletcher does an amazing job as the lead most of the dialogue was improvised giving it a natural feel. Rampage is obviously a brutal film and there aren't many directors who have the for lack of a better word balls to do a film like this. Uwe Boll pulls it off with style and at points you even sympathize for Bill even though what he's doing is so wrong. For me this really shows how great of a director Uwe Boll really is.Uwe Boll is constantly improving and I'll definitely be checking out his future work.

Planted into his mind a seed if you will by his best friend EvanShaun Sipos who has a cynical unfavorable view of mankind is kind of the one responsiblehe couldn't possibly know his pal's true intentions or how far he would go for encouraging BillFletcherto go on the eventual rampage.This notion that the world is overpopulated and the only way to solve the problem is to kill many of the people behind the earth's plight that's enoughalong with the viewpoint that we live these meaningless lives and how greed has corrupted the earthto move Bill into action.So he goes on a murderous rampage having purchased machine guns and put together his own makeshift suit of armor to counter gunfire. His targets are anybody and everybody and Bill goes down city blocksafter exploding a police station and shooting the officers who weren't blown to smithereens with the use of C4 inside a vanfiring on frightened shouting innocent bystanders. Whether it be girls in a beauty salon or employees at a savings and loan bank anyone is fair game for this twisted psychopath.I think this was Uwe Boll's way of exploring how America is a breeding ground for terrorism and at any moment someone with enough determination and motivation could march down public places gunning down those who get in his way or seem meaningless to him. It's a disturbing odyssey as we follow Bill during his massacre. Boll shows us a scene where Bill'smother calls him up warning him of the crazy lunatic on the rampage so unaware that it's her own son behind the slaughter. This cleverly planned massacre will have specifically chosen victims such as Evan a coffee shop serverwho doesn't adhere to Bill's desire for a certain latte he wanted with extra foam and chicken fast food restaurant employee who Bill had come across before his rampage. This movie is a punch in the face and the rampage itself is gratuitous with Boll shooting his subject in Cinma vrit stylein other words the camera shakes and jerks with Boll opting for the steadicam method and the director also juxtaposes images of the upcoming events in the opening 30 minutes as a preludepreparation for what will happen at Bill's hands. We watch in horror as Fletcher's cold blooded shooter just annihilates all in his trajectory bodies falling as Bill fires in all directions. Matt Frewer and Lynda Boyd are Bill's clueless parents consumed with their jobs not a clue that their obedient son is psychotic. Particularly haunting is the ending as Bill announces to the world that he's willing to cleanse the earth for you. Boll in my opinion has finally risen out of the critical abyss tackling some pretty potent controversial subject matter. RAMPAGE is certain to have people talkingin a different way besides bashing Boll's inabilities to direct and this is definitely a step in the right direction for Boll.".

But the thing that gets me is the accusations that this movie is ruining youth or making people snap and go on rampages. Really can someone be that ignorant? This movie shows a little bit into the lives some people face and the solutions they create to better their position in the world no matter how extreme. It shocks me that people would go so far as to say things such asThis will only be lapped up by people with a lesser IQ than a box of matches.To be that closed minded to a film such as this is truly sad. It makes me wonder..But With a solid story line like it was hot off the front page of some foreign newspaper and a relatively strong cast I'd give it a 8 to 9 out of 10. Not because of the mass killings or the first person shooter thrill but because it is a truly entangling brilliant non run of the mill film that makes one think about war and the views of the world. The use of the build up scenes to the rampage in which all is calm shouldn't be taken as a slowness in the film but as what it really is the premeditation of an act in which change would be brought about.And truthfully the acts displayed in the movie and acts such as these have been discussed among people I know and myself and this movie is a display of what would happen if those discussions were put into action. Not that they would be. But there is a point and its not shallow or paper thin its just pushed to the back of the mind. Well I'd love to keep ranting but I'll leave it up to you to decide.

	schema:headline " The Batman of our dreams! So much more than a comic book movie";
	schema:reviewBody "I got to see The Dark Knight on Wednesday night the reason though why I'm writing this movie comment this late is because I didn't wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome I wanted to think it through still today I can't stop thinking about this movie! The Dark Knight lives up to it's hype and goes beyond it this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story we are finally told why the villains are the way they are how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batman's skin how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger I absolutely loved Jack Nicolson's performance in the 1989 film when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight I was like What are they kidding? once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible! I'm not going to compare Jack and Heath's performance because they were two different versions of the Joker but Heath's Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didn't know what he was going to do next he was so crazy he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character and the worst part is not only that he's crazy he's driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control and guess what he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. This was so much more than a Batman film this was so much more than a comic book film The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama action romance horror dark humor the study of a psychopathic killer a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan who's previous film Batman Begins didn't really thrill me but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie you know it's not real people don't dress up in costumes and save the day villains don't name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real like it could happen.Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney Harvey Dent he's inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town and he's going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gotham's mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the Classy Villain that Gotham needs he also has brought a new thought into Batman's head of them actually being more alike than different that Batman completes him the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent who is Gotham's White Knight trying to put all of Gotham's scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.All the performances are dead on in this movie now everyone's going crazy over Heath Ledger's performance but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey DentTwo Face his performance was just as great as Heath's and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special but I don't wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie I can't come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I could this is the Batman film that we have been waiting for. I've seen it twice in one weekend I'm going to see it three times this upcoming week I don't mind one bit. I can't wait for the sequel and I would just like to say RIP to Heath wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as The Joker.1010".

	schema:headline " Surpasses Begins in every aspect!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy The Dark Knight EXCEEDED all  of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman  franchise they took what was already established and expanded it  amped it up and gave a deeper darker and brooding story that is more  gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times  throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman sworn to  fight evil and injustice though also quite reluctant and uncertain if  his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his  fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the  help of his trusted butlerally Alfred played superbly by Michael  Cane grounds him gives him moral support and keeps him in check. But  the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly  enemy The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that as good as Jack  Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker.  He is sadistic psychotic and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY  disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime  and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original  cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart Maggie Gyllenhaal  and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes Gyllenhaal gives a  much better performance and is a far cry from the damselindistress  stereotype though there's a little of it THANKFULLY that's common in  films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around  more so than Holmes. Even better the fight sequences are vastly  improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than Begins  in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.  Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan who gives the  film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than Begins. The  action is great and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud  Christopher Nolan Christian Bale and especially Heath Ledger who  sadly passed away earlier this year and all those aboard for believing  in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may  feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death but as a final note I  will say this sincerely from my heart Remember Heath Ledger and honor  him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances but as a  human being and father to his daughter Matilda  Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his  daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this  role and past roles but as an incredible individual and talented  actor.  Rest in peace. Heath Ledger 4419791222008.".

I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. The Dark Knight is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself in screen time is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret I believe is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!".

	schema:reviewBody "I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie specifically a sequel and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel Star Wars films I rated that one the best as good as any of the originals...for a time until my opinion balanced out and I had a more wellrounded take. For that reason I steer away from that mindset and did for Dark Knight.Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night Dark Knight ably stands on its own with or without Batman Begins. At a two and a half hour runtime it's definitely an epic of a movie but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal and gruesome tour of Gotham City.Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that to be a good guy and think like the Joker it really takes a toll and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages explosives or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind there was really only one faithful portrayal of him and that could be found in the Batman animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in Batman Forever he certainly did not though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here delivering a performance out of this world easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent the good that has no jurisdiction no procedures...and no rules save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.The Dark Knight gets a solid 10 of 10 stars.".

I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.The Dark Knight gets a solid 10 of 10 stars.";

	schema:reviewBody "I must say I was excited for this movie since the instant BATMAN BEGINS appeared on screen at the end of the first film. It was always going to be good and sadly it was always going to be overhyped by the advertising warhorses.It is rare though that a movie can surpass all the hype and pass all expectations on the film. Nolan The Prestige Begins delivers on more than the Joker we remember from the 'Old Days' of Burton and Nicholson. Instead we're given a psychopathic sadist who pleasures from sheer anarchy.All the hailing of Ledger's performance are grounded. Watching it will make you feel a different chill down your spine than you'd remember from any other film. It's impossible quite literally to relate to The Joker. He gets inside your head with his stories of how he got his scars makes you laugh at his sick jokes then makes you instantly wonder why you're laughing.If Ledger wasn't enough to horrify you  wait for Harvey Dent. Brilliantly portrayed by Aaron Eckhart as Gotham's 'fallen White Knight' and Batman's direct counterpart. His transformation will put Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal look like children's breakfast cartoons. Gyllenhaal had perfect chemistry with both Bale and Eckhart Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both work well as Batman's 'conscience' and of course Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon were all solid.There are some major differences between The Dark Knight and Begins. Firstly the music is extremely disconcerted compared with the 'majestic but unfinished' tones of Begins  but it suits the film's tone Anarchy in every sense. There was a more solid singular villain compared with the many in Begins  but there was also a lot more henchmen in TDK. The martial art direction was faster and more efficient  as mentioned in the film learning through experience.I was disappointed at the role of Scarecrow in this film it just felt like a loose thread and wasn't quite closed up or explained and the ending while it wasn't what I expected others have said that it was predictable but for me it wasn't was solid and suited the film well.All in all this is a film that is quite close if it isn't already a masterpiece. Nolan has a great thing going and unlike previous 'Superhero' adaptations Spiderman and Fantastic Four for example there isn't campiness creeping in. In face if Batman Begins was 1010 The Dark Knight deserves a 12. Quite simply the best possible sequel that could've been given.If you watch this which I implore that you do you certainly won't regret it. One of the best movies of 2008 I'll wait till Quantum of Solace comes out before I pass judgement  but certainly a film worth getting excited for. If you don't like it then that's also fine  but keep in mind that you probably thought Meet The Spartans was a good movie so the rest of us won't take it to heart.Stunning in every aspect and exceeds all hype and expectation... Can't wait to watch it again or for the BluRay!".

	schema:reviewBody "I thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together  movie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new  insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in  his role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an  honesttogoodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting  perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet.  But after seeing The Dark Knight Batman Begins will forevermore be  viewed by me at least as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN'  MASTERPIECE of a superhero film.  To say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would  be akin to calling the NolanLedger Joker 'a bit eccentric'.  While watching it I found myself thinking it was very long which is  usually a sign that it's TOO long and therefore boring. But that's not  actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas philosophical  musings THEMES which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over  in favour of cool setpieces as many comic adaptations are but wants  to explore wants to allow the characters to explore at a logical  pace. So what I guess I'm saying is considering what it sets out to  do the movie is long ENOUGH while still constantly holding the  viewer's interest.  And that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of  big action either. On the contrary there is some truly awesome stuff  going on here. The chase with the truck for example is fantastic and  there's some great handtohand stuff too.  But what engages us most is the characters and while the script is  brilliant the dialogue is sharp and quite funny for the first  twothirds before the drama really kicks in this mainly comes down  to the cast.  Christian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val  Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and  committed as always. He gives the character LIFE and actually makes us  feel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose  it's pretty appropriate.  Heath Ledger. Y'know I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination and  thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar?  Is that what it's come to? Then I thought is it because he didn't get  one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died?  But...well...how can I put it...?   It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero  but after seeing Heath at work...Jack who once seemed so awesome just  looks...well...lame.  If you've seen it you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you  need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment.  Maggie Gyllenhaal. I didn't have any problem with Katie in the first  one at the time but I doubt she could have pulled off the more  emotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was  necessary does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with  Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such  garbage here? they could have done a buttload worse than Maggie. She  rocks.  As does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to  say my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you  get the idea.  Michael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz.  Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK.  Gary Oldman. As in BB no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics.  Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian Heath  and Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular  talent. Go Gaz.  Eric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister!  The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful wellexecuted  entertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and  action.  I've liked every Batman movie so far okay besides Batman  Robin  but this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this Is Christopher Nolan's follow up to the critically acclaimed 2005 film Batman Begins The Dark Knight as good as everyone is saying? Quite simply yes yes it is. There is no doubt about it one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. This is no ordinary superhero movie this is a character and dialogue driven piece not as action orientated as you might expect.I will not go into plot details because there is a lot of it. However a basic one sentence summary is Batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy someone with no real motives...The Joker. Now that that is out of the way I will start off with the actors and boy is there a lot to talk about. Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved Caped Crusader with him already blowing everyone else out of water with Batman Begins. Bruce Wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and criminal. His perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadgetriddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in Gotham City and decides to give the lawbreakers a dose of their own medicine. Because of this and Bale's tremendous acting Bruce Wayne is justified and we emphasise with Bale's flawed hero more than any of the other actors. If there ever was an excellent Batman this is it. The theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here.Of course I am sure you all want know if Heath Ledger was that good. And I can safely say that he most definitely was. Ledger's Joker is not only the best but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. His performance is truly terrifying chilling brilliant any synonyms of the previous adjectives. Every scene he is in is stolen. The Joker truly is Batman's worst villain cunning and psychotic nothing quite matches his laugh and sinister makeup. If Ledger nabs the Oscar for Best Actor I honestly will not be surprised. It is a true tragedy to see such a talented actor fall at such a young age...All the other actors cannot be forgotten though. Aaron Eckhart has definitely proved himself previously Thankyou for Smoking as someone to watch out for. Here as Harvey Dent and later Two Face he is very powerful. All he wants is justice to bring down every single criminal. Eckhart is the definitive Two Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Wayne and Dent's love interest Rachel Dawes is much better than Katie Holmes. Gyllenhaal's performance has substance I really cared for her and her future and she was terrific in every scene. Michael Caine can do no wrong and as Alfred Pennyworth he provides some comical and emotional scenes. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox although a limited role does inject some sly humour and much needed morals into the story. Finally Gary Oldman's Lt. James Gordon is riveting. He at least needs a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as another crimefighting hero who faces some challenging situations.Wally Pfister's cinematography is simply stunning. Gotham has never looked so good so big and deep. His wide shots purvey a dirty aura and contribute to the feel of the film. Without it it may not have been the same. Another Oscar worthy portion THE MUSIC! With Hans Zimmer AND James Newton Howard at the helm how could it go wrong? The score sets the mood in every scene giving an epic and thrilling tone. During the action sequences it really ups the adrenaline. And on the topic of action The Dark Knight succeeds in having the best fight sequences and car chases in a comic book adaptation yet. With no obvious or overuse of CGI the explosions and accidents are the real deal. Thrilling edge of your seat and violent this is brutally awesome stuff.Nevertheless none of this would be possible without Christopher Nolan the man behind it all. Pairing up with the writer and brother Jonathon Nolan the darkest Batman movie yet is the best and the best so far this year. This does not feel like a comic book film the dialogue and situations feel so realistic. And it IS the script that drives this film. The dialogue is very very well written and is the centre of the conflict and the movie.It may be bold to say this but this is the best superhero film of all time. There are others that are magnificent Superman and XMen are two examples but this is the most complex the most dark and the most spectacular and epic of them all. See it for Bale for Ledger for the music the action and for Nolan's flawless direction.55 and the best film of 2008 so far!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Synopsis Bruce WayneBatman Christian Bale continues to eliminate crime in Gotham City with the help of Lt. Jim Gordon Gary Oldman and the new District Attorney Harvey Dent Aaron Eckhart. The Dark Knight wants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. Batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind known as the Joker Heath Ledger has taken over organized crime. The Joker's plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos and kill Batman. Batman takes the fight with the Joker personal which makes him confront his own beliefs. The Joker is the most dangerous criminal that Batman has encountered and he will need all his strength and vigilance to defeat him.My Comment This film just blew me away. Christian Bale is a natural as Bruce WayneBatman and Michael Caine fits the part of Alfred the trusted butler. Heath Ledger's performance as the sadistic Joker was absolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. I would not want to meet the Joker in a dark alley and whatever you do don't ask him how he got his smile especially when he has a knife in his hand. Ledger's performance has turned the Joker into a new iconic movie villain image. Between all the punches mayhem and explosions there is some good sinister dialog. The movie not only has a lot of action it also tells the story of the internal struggle that Bruce Wayne is having with being the Batman hero. Bruce Wayne wants to be himself and maintain the difference between himself and Batman. Bruce must decide to follow the code or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. The movie explores the literary themes of Hero verses Villain as well as Order verses Anarchy and the Joker explains to Batman that to have one you must have the other and because of that they will always be connected. The movie is long but it went by so fast. You will love the last 45 minutes because of the nonstop action with Batman in his new sonic suit and his BatPod. With all the explosions body count and the dark mood of the movie I don't think parents should take young children. Warner Bros. Pictures Run Time 232 Rated PG131010".

	schema:headline " Batman at his best and beyond";
	schema:reviewBody "Batman has always been my favourite superhero ever since the first time I heard about him because he his human with no powers also he is much more questionable than any other superhero. The story of the film is about Batman Lieutenant James Gordon and new district attorney Harvey Dent beginning to succeed in rounding up the criminals that plague Gotham City. They are unexpectedly challenged when a mysterious criminal mastermind known as the Joker appears in Gotham. Batman's struggle against the Joker becomes deeply personal forcing him to confront everything he believes and to improve his technology which introduces the recreation of the Batcycle known as the Batpod and the Batsuit was redesigned to stop the madman's campaign of destruction. During the course of the film a love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne Dent and Rachel Dawes.There are now six Batman films and I must say that The Dark Knight is the best out of all of them. The title is good because that is what Batman actually is. It has been 3 years for the adventure to continue from Batman Begins but that entire wait was worth it. Gotham city is very Gothic looking and is very haunting and visionary. The whole movie is charged with pulsepounding suspense ingenious special effects and riveting performances from a firstrate cast especially from Heath Ledger who gave an Oscar nomination performance for best supportingactor. It is a shame that he can't see his terrific work onscreen. The cinematography is excellent which is made so dark  sinister that really did suit the mood for the film. Usually sequels don't turn out to be better than the original but The Dark Knight is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original like The Godfather 2. I also really liked the poster where the building is on fire in a Bat symbol  Batman is standing in front of it. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and his film Memento is one of my most favourite films. He hasn't made 10 movies yet and 3 of them are already on the IMDb top 250. Overall The Dark Knight is the kind of movie that will make the audience cheer in the end instead of throwing fruit  vegetables on the screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Dark Knight maintained the intensity and overall gunmetal grayish feel that sets this Batman apart. The film takes us to a Gotham City that has grown accustomed to the big bat's crimefighting crusades and the last remaining big time criminals have actually grown fearful of his wrath. They form an alliance to attempt to keep their illicit business activities alive but are feeling even more pressure from yet a different angle the passionate and fearless new district attorney Harvey Dent. Recognizing the crime group's looming extinction a stranger enters their circle and offers what he thinks is the only solution kill Batman.The bad guys don't know if they can trust this seemingly demented madman and they later learn the hard way that they don't really have a choice for the most disturbing part of the Joker's personality is his motive. He doesn't care about money or power. He just enjoys causing trouble and watching with pleasure from the sidelines as the terrorized city scrambles in mayhem...which leads me to the real star of this film Heath Ledger.Ledger's performance as the Joker is astounding and consuming. We come facetoface with a villain bearing the coldness of a psychopath and a personality that remains as mysterious and inexplicable as the real reason for the scars on his face. He develops the air of the lone offender quite early on as he nonchalantly kills those who help him commit his crimes. Yet he has no problem building an army of followers and the viewers easily find that believable. As insane as he is he's focused and quite determined. Ledger also brings the Joker's humor to the role but he does it in a way that is unique to this interpretation...with subtlety and honesty. The very words and mannerisms that made me laugh also evoked feelings of sadness in its clarity. The evil is incredibly convincing.Although Batman is a character that is often marketed towards kids this film is definitely not appropriate for young children. In addition to the dark images the violence both seen and implied is sometimes unsettling and Ledger's Joker is chilling even for adult viewers. Having said that this is by far one of the best films I've ever seen and it will easily find a place in my personal top ten. I am only disappointed that this Joker the best villain in a film since Hannibal Lecter will never be revealed to us again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's open this review with the fact that Batman is THE BEST superhero ever with no other even coming close to his levels. So when a sequel is made for an unforgettable movie like Batman Begins expectations are EXTREMELY high. I think that if you could describe this movie in a few words it would be 152 minutes of pure awesomeness. Christopher Nolan probably created the best ever comic book adaptation of a movie. The movie itself has been adapted in a much more realistic fashion than the comic book series. First of all this movie is PERFECT for people who like punches drama shooting and explosions. The movie has a complicated plot that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. It's anything BUT corny since a few important characters die and the ending isn't happy but it's flawless. Christian Bale has proved himself one again as an amazing actor. Michael Cane portrays Alfred Pennyworth makes you fall in love with Batman's loyal butler. Now anyone that has seen the movie and is reading this review is probably wondering why I haven't mentioned the main reason why this movie is flawless. And yes there is ONE main reason Heath Ledger. Heath Ledger portrayed Batman's arch nemesis in this movie the Joker. Now anyone who has a clue in comic books knows that the Joker is INCREDIBLE. Heath Ledger's acting in this movie has turned the Joker into a LEGEND. I have never seen such perfect and realistic acting than the portrayal of the Joker in this movie. The Joker is portrayed in a much more mature fashion than the comic books and that's why it was so good. It's simply impossible to describe him he's bold insane smart twisted and he's so awesome in this film that at some points you love him even more than Batman. If I haven't mentioned it by now this is without a doubt the best movie I have seen.Those who come with high expectations after seeing Batman Begins will not be disappointed. I advise that no one under the age of 11 watches this movie as TwoFace's appearance is rather frightening and the film contains intense action.".

By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act doesn't matter what character he could do it.The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding the story is developed constantly after each scene making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No it kept going which was awesome the story kept getting darker and darker I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman good performance Heath Ledger played extremely well Maggie was annoying at times but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.Great directing made the movie enjoyable they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful lighting was done well especially showing Harvey Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.This movie deserves a 1010 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. May he R.I.P His performance made what this film is right now.I recommend this film for any action fan especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!".

So I finally paid my ticket and watched the movie.The movie starts off really strong the opening scene was an absolute blast literally. From that point on though I didn't feel the same action. The rest of the movie just seemed drawn out and completely over the top. Honestly where did the joker find a rocket launcher in Gotham City? This movie was just too long and much of the dialogue was something that a kid writes in senior creative writing and thinks it's brilliant. Also the director did an excellent job of warping the joker from one place to the next the joker must have had a helicopter or a really loyal taxi driver. One second he's here and the next he's on top of that building. Probably the last straw was when Morgan Freeman showed up. He turns around and the camera is at a low angle as if to show the arrival of Morgan Freeman the ultimate modern narrator who is now in every movie an older version of Samuel L Jackson who is soft spoken. They kind of made up for it when Debo from Friday showed up as the scary convict on the boat.After sitting in my seat for two and half hours as characters appeared and disappeared the movie finally ended and it ended in a very clich way. Way to say the title of the movie as the last word in the film thats never been done ever?and The Dark Knight had to include the bain of every modern movie being able to track people's cell phone calls. This little gimmick is in way too many movie these days.so ya I sat there for two and a half house and my butt really hurt I wasted ten dollars on a cool movie but one that wasn't as good as people claimed. Maybe next time Christian Bale will take some cough drops before showing up on set.".

Uneven scripting there.But that's nitpicking in comparison to the film's greater faults. The ultimate reason why The Dark Knight falls short of the masterpiece label is because there is absolutely no way under any circumstances at any time on any planet or in any solar system that The Joker could execute so many complex plans in such a short period of time.OK here is where people start saying But it's a movie! It doesn't have to be possible. I know thanks. I agree it doesn't have to be possible. But and this is a huge BUT a film as ambitious and lengthy as The Dark Knight wants to be taken seriously. Not only does it want to be taken seriously I think director Christopher Nolan wants Oscar consideration for the work he has put in here and cast members have been saying regularly that they don't want this to be considered as a mere superhero movie or action movie. Well if you want to elevate to the level of serious drama then you have to explain a few things to me.1 How does The Joker continue to find willing participants in his escapades when all of his previous crew members end up dead or in jail? The guys he's finding to work for him have to be true idiots. Totally brainless. And that doesn't work because The Joker's plans are meticulous and require precise timing and execution. If these goons are dumb enough to work for him they aren't smart enough to be effective as help. It's a perpetual contradiction throughout the film particularly the second act.2 Sure The Joker is swift and tricky but c'mon he doesn't exactly look like a normal citizen. If citywide security has been heightened to a level never before seen how the hell is this maniac with a painted face and wacky hair not being spotted? Does he have an invisible transportation machine or something? He doesn't have supernatural powers so he shouldn't have a supernatural aura.3 When did he have the time to wire the hospital with bombs? Even if one of his goons did it how did no one in the hospital notice suspicious activity? What about the assassination attempt on the Mayor? The other cops on the firing line didn't notice the most infamous villain in the city standing right next to them? Why? Because he crouched over a little and tried not to make eye contact with them? Please. I could go on for days too many plot liberties were taken.I'd actually like to discuss the performances a bit. I think the separation between the strongest part and the rest of the cast is the largest ever with an ensemble of this size and magnitude. Meaning Heath Ledger's performance was far and away the best in this film better to the point where it bothered me that no one else was in his realm. The scenes where Ledger was off screen lacked the magnetism and intrigue of the ones in which he appeared. Although appeared is probably not the best word more like dominated. Christian Bale was OK as Batman but he's almost too stoic for a character with such strong morals and opinions. He's also a little bit stiff when he's in playboy mode as Bruce Wayne. I think his performance in The Prestige was more emotional effective and polished.Aaron Eckhart was all right as Harvey DentTwoFace but the problem was that the vast majority of the time I was seeing Eckhart on screen not Dent. The same Eckhart we saw in Thank You For Smoking. Also a man with a finely tuned social philosophy like Dent would not totally flip his ideology after the loss of a close loved one. Hopefully the angle is that the toxin causing the disfigurement messed more with his brain than we were led on to believe.Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman were believable as always but of course they are underused as Alfred and Lucius Fox. Gary Oldman probably contributed the second strongest performance in the film as Commissioner Gordon and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes was a step up from Katie Holmes as far as execution and timing  but that's not saying much. I really could go on for days about the unacceptable plot liberties but I'll spare you. All in all I liked the film because it had some thoughtprovoking sequences involving moral dilemmas and intriguing societal questions and in having such The Dark Knight succeeded in escaping the superhero movie label. But it's not a masterpiece.Plain and simply it has too many holes.".

I was sceptical about him because people tend to exaggerate performances of popular dead actors but i must honestly admit he blew me away. He also blew every actor away he shared screen time with i liked gary oldman best together with him in a scene. I am still wowed by Hedgers performance and i must admit i really feel frustrated that he is gone this performance MUST get an Oscar.Caine was very good Bale was OK although i don't like him as batman he is a good Bruce Wayne but not a good batman and i really enjoyed Aaron Eckart as Harvey Dent.But i thought the movie also had quite a few flaws.Without giving away too much i really though most of the combat action scenes were not easily watchable because they were to fast to follow I really didn't like the way they went with two face and the ending sequence with the bat and the joker to me was a let down. Also i don't like the way Nolan tells the story but i must admit thats a personal opinion.There were 2 surprising moments that i really loved one containing a pencil which got me laughing very hard and the other the choice sequence which ended in a way i didn't see coming but loved it.All in all an OK superhero movie 7 stars but 9? come on people that's crazy.It's unbelievable that movies like the matrix 1  gladiator as good as it gets l.a. confidential eternal sunshine and the spotless mind don't rank as high as this movie i cant understand it although i respect it.Happy to share my feel about this movieRealkane".

	schema:reviewBody "Many commenters said they were blown away so it probably has succeeded in blowing away the box office. I waited until the second week and had high expectations from the 9 and 10 ratings it was receiving. But fellow moviefilm viewers and especially great film lovers ... really!? There's no doubt about the action and action and action in this one and thus the special effects. That's the main reason I enjoy such fantasy flicks  the comic book genre. So this one does more of it and perhaps better than the last Batman and the last Spiderman and the last super heroes but I would not rank it up with Iron Man. So special effects and makeup may earn it awards.Maybe I'm beginning to burn out on all the action and special effects of movies though. Or perhaps I need more from a movie. With 45 minutes to go I was ready for it to end. It was way too long. Some reviewers thought the acting was superb. What acting  do they mean the one or twominute interludes between the fast and furious segments of action and destruction? I'm not down on any of the actors for their roles or parts  but where were there any parts of substance in acting? True Heath Ledger does a very good Joker. But then who hasn't Nicholson et al who have ever played those roles in Batman Superman etc? As for plot  well anyone who knows the genre and a story that combines Batman with the Joker knows to expect the unexpected with the Joker. So the plot goes from one unexpected to another  as though the variety and mixture and change in unexpecteds is trying to outdo the action mayhem.When I saw that this stands as 1 in the top 250 right now I clicked on the list. But how this movie for acting and plot and yes even action in many cases could rank up there with the likes of the Lord of the Rings the Star Wars films and many great classics with real suspense I have to mention Casablanca Vertigo North by Northwest is beyond me. I'm not that far off with the overall trends in the IMDb reviews but can't agree with so many who rate this film at the top.It's good and entertaining  but too long. It's not great by any means. I love the youth of today I have a few grandchildren and I don't mean to disparage them by this observation  but I think this high acclaim by many for this film may reflect a very large very young audience most members of whom don't have a great deal of quality and varied films in their viewing history. To all of those young people I urge a look at the top 250 list or other major review ratings  and then that you rent borrow or otherwise watch some of the other great films. I promise you won't be disappointed or bored and you may get an understanding maybe appreciation for of some past customs life styles dress behaviors etc. To be sure you will have great entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whatever else it may be The Dark Knight Christopher Nolan's follow up to his Batman Begins the film that resurrected the Batman franchise is the most ambitious superhero film ever made. It's full of brooding ruminations about the inherent nature of humanity obviously fueled by the troubled state of a post911 world and it packs an awful lot of plot into its twoandahalfhour running time. However be cautioned and don't let its 1 rating at IMDb set up expectations that the film can't possibly meet. I doubt any experienced film goer is truly going to think that this is the best film ever made.The praise heaped on Heath Ledger for his performance as the Joker is well deserved. Indeed the Joker becomes the focus of this movie which may not be such a desirable thing given that this is...you know....a Batman movie. The caped crusader fades into the background in this installment to the point where you might leave the movie and forget that he was in it. Ditto Maggie Gyllenhaal who plays the love interest and who true to the superhero movie formula gets practically nothing to do. But Ledger you WILL remember. He creates a fascinating character in the Joker and it's through him that the movie poses all of its major moral questions. Is it human nature as the Joker suggests to devolve into chaos when the illusion of order is taken away or do humans have an inherent kindness that will cause them to look out for one another even when circumstances seem to call for self preservation? One of the most fascinating things about Ledger's creation is that the Joker has no more motive as a criminal than to pose questions like this. He's not out for money or even power  he just wants to create anarchy and see what happens.I was not prepared for the other villain the screenplay throws into the mix Two Face played well by Aaron Eckhart. The film is too long and it's this storyline that makes it so. Chrisotpher Nolan and his brother Jonathan the cowriters of the film would have done well to leave this plot line out. By the end of the film there are too many characters doing too many things independently of one another so that the film loses focus slightly.The movie looks fantastic though and the production team does wonders with Chicago where I live by the way. In fact the look of the film is one of its major selling points and I was pleased to finally see a superhero film that looks cinematic rather than cartoonish.So...an excellent addition to the superhero genre and a completely entertaining experience....but it's still after all a Batman movie and it's not the best film since Citizen Kane.

	schema:headline " The film that seems to have fooled everyone!";
	schema:reviewBody "OK lets get it out of the way I'm a massive Batman fan. I loved the TV show when I was a kid really enjoyed the early Tim Burton films and have even worn the costume on a few occasions. I've even taken the time to read Batman comics and graphic novels. I thought Christian Bale was an excellent choice of the lead role for the new films and thought the first one was a great start and I was really looking forward to this one. So how come I've just walked out of the cinema feeling very disappointed? Why? Because this film just wasn't that good. It's far too long has very little fun in it and takes itself so seriously it's painful. The makers have thrown the kitchen sink at it with very little thought. The whole thing was one great big dreadful noisy mess. The only good thing in it is Heath Ledger's performance. I had my doubts when I first heard who'd they'd cast but I gotta hand it to Heath he pulled it off. No thanks to the film however which is so over cooked it's burnt. Sure there's loads of action cool bat gadgets and lots of running about and shouting but absolutely no soul. It was great looking but has no personality. I felt neither happy scared or even mildly concerned let alone entertained. I really didn't give a damn. So next time people slim it down less is more. It's not Apocalypse Now put some fun into it.....Why so serious?".

I loved the TV show when I was a kid really enjoyed the early Tim Burton films and have even worn the costume on a few occasions. I've even taken the time to read Batman comics and graphic novels. I thought Christian Bale was an excellent choice of the lead role for the new films and thought the first one was a great start and I was really looking forward to this one.

	schema:reviewBody "A sentence with the words David Cronenberg and car racing movie isn't exactly something you hear every day but yes Cronenberg did in fact make one in the late 70s in between his horror classics 'Rabid' and 'The Brood'. Very few people outside of Canada have seen 'Fast Company' and as Cronenberg is my favourite contemporary director I've been intrigued about it for years. Now that Blue Underground have released a restored version on DVD we can all finally get to see it. Now I'd love to be able to say that's it's some kind of lost masterpiece and essential viewing for Cronenberg buffs but to be honest it's just an enjoyable bgrade racing movie the kind of flick AIP would have released without a blink of an eye. I seriously doubt that anyone who watched it not knowing who directed it would be able to guess that Cronenberg was involved. He himself regards it as an important movie in his career as it was another step in his learning how to make real movies and because he also met several key future collaborators. That historical interest aside it's by far the most normal and therefore least interesting movie he's made to date. The movie is helped immeasurably by having bgrade legends William Smith 'Run Angel Run' 'Invasion Of The Bee Girls' 'Boss Ngger' 'The Ultimate Warrior' and John Saxon 'Planet Of Blood' 'Enter The Dragon' 'Black Christmas' 'Cannibal Apocalypse' as leads. Smith  plays Lonnie Johnson a racer under pressure from his sponsors who are represented by the back stabbing Saxon. The two work well together and by the looks of the short interview included on the DVD seem like great buddies. The late Claudia Jennings her final role plays Smith's love interest Sammy and Nicholas Campbell who subsequently acted in Cronenberg's 'The Brood' 'The Dead Zone' and 'Naked Lunch' plays his cocky protege Billy The Kid Brocker. The main problem with the movie apart from the awful subSpringsteen rawk score is a dull script. With a bit more work the movie really could have been something special  but as it stands 'Fast Company' is little more than an interesting curio for fans of Cronenberg andor 70s exploitation movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fast Company 1979 is an interesting film by David Cronenberg. He took a departure from his clinical horror films and made a quasi mainstream film dealing with hot rods and the sleazy sideshow aspect of them. Unlike most films of this genre Cronenberg takes a look at the shady business that the promoters of the drivers do to try a make a buck whenever they can. Most times at the expense of the driver's safety and welfare. I wasn't expecting much from this movie but I was quite surprised at the results. AllAmerican tough guy William Smith plays the lead whilst John Saxon costars as his shady promoter manager.In the hands of any other director this movie wouldn't have been that watchable. But Cronenberg works with what he has and creates a visually appealing movie. The inside shots of the driver was very well done. In some scenes the driver looks as if he's part of the machine! The camera catches the action and you can feel yourself being dragged along at 200 plus miles an hour. The film follows these drivers as the go from one small town to another performing in front of small crowds. This movie neither glamorizes or denegrate the sport. It just documents it.Like I said in the beginning I wasn't expecting much maybe because this movie wasn't widely released if at all in the U.S.A. but I was surprisingly pleased with the end results. I would have to recommend this film for Cronenberg and William Smith fans.B".

I am not going to add any more film criticism here but wanted to make the point that it is rare movie because of the age of this famous film maker because few VHS copies were ever released and because it is a Northernmade drive in movie made by a young Canadian film maker. Yes Canadian. LOL And oh yes a certain November 1969 Playboy model named Claudia Jennings was featured in this movie and tragically and perhaps ironically lost her life in a car accident shortly after. So yes I think Fatss Company is a collector's movie.Canada had just started offering incentives to U.S. film makers to come up north so David was in the right place at the right time. A long string of very famous movies have been shot here in Alberta and Brad Pitt is getting ready to star in a movie about Jesse Jamesright here as I am typing this.One last thing If you look VERY carefully in the stands near the crash scene you may be able to see me in my Mopar ball capyes I was there.

As for the cast it's impeccable. Smith known mostly for playing mean dudes like Falconetti in Rich Man Poor Man is terrific here as the good guy and John Saxon is simply superb as the slimy rep.

	schema:reviewBody "Lonnie Lucky Man Johnson is an veteran drag racer and head honcho of his race team that's sponsored by FastCo Oil. Their business man Phil Adamson thinks only of the sponsorships than winning and when Lonnie's hotrod explodes Phil isn't too happy. Seeing that Lonnie is the one who draws the crowds Phil gets Lonnie to take over Bill The Kid Broker's car which doesn't go down to well with Bill. Their rival team led by Gary  The Blacksmith Black would like the chance to beat Lonnie and things do heat up when Adamson decides he wants to make some changes.When you think of the name David Cronenberg does drag racing come straight to mind? Most definitely not but on this occasion he has churned out a rather normal exploitation flick on the sport. You don't always associated the word normal to his name but even though its an entertaining piece it's really nothing much out of the ordinary. That's probably the best reason why it flies under radar well it won't escape the fans' of the director's work though. Cronenberg's excursion into Fast Company is pretty much a lowbudgeted film that's marketed for a more mainstream audience. I didn't really know about this film that pretty much came out of the blue when I found out it was directed by Cronenberg. So I've been itching to get my hands on it and I gladly came across the 2 disc special edition release at my local library. I'm no revhead fan but I couldn't help but get drawn into the thick of the action thanks largely to Mark Irwin's cinematography. I actually didn't mind this little picture but you still call it a rather a hot and cold detour. The film looked great with it's semidocumentary style where there were a lot of creative angel shots that caught the action superbly and the beautiful Canadian landscape that fills the frame also leaves a mark in your mind. Cronenberg manages to stage the setpieces involving the dragsters quite well as you watch some burning rubber along with the crowd. It's just like the real deal! But when it wasn't focusing on the racing it becomes the usual the good guys v bad guys theme where it becomes morally hounded and predictable. You feel the tension between the teams and the plot shows the manipulative nature of sponsorship deals taking over the show. But the drama element runs low on fuel. It just feels leaden with a simple script that doesn't really seem to go anywhere with some underwritten plot details but still there's a nice amount of sharp humour evident. The film's conclusion might be exciting but still it's rather illogical you could say. The howling rock soundtrack that surrounds the film felt overly tacky and got a bit repetitious. The performances from the main two leads lifts most of the acting out of the standard mould. William Smith and John Saxon make the most out of their character's material. Saxon is a great character actor and he steals the film as the slimly sponsor adviser Phil Adamson. Smith adds a steady head to the veteran driver Lonnie Johnson. Also in the supporting roles is the gorgeous Claudia Jennings as Lonnie's love interest Sammy Nicholas Campbell plays the up and coming youngster Bill Broker and Cedric Smith plays the competition Gary 'The Blacksmith' Black. There's definitely a lot of stunning gals in this picture. Well cars and girls go down rather nicely don't they.Rather a middling affair that has it's perks. When it's close to the action that's when it hits it's strides by making you feel like you're there. It's nothing overly showy but it's a mildly entertaining romp for the undemanding.".

Lonnie takes new racer Billy Brocker Nicholas Campbell under his wing and soon the two are into a deadly game with the owner.FAST COMPANY is a pretty strange movie from David Cronenberg. Usually when you think of Cronenberg and strange you think of the countless bizarre horror films that he made during this era but what makes this film strange is the fact that there's no gore no bloody murders or anything to that nature. Inf act FAST COMPANY is a pretty laid back picture that almost feels like a madefortelevision flick and it probably could have been if it wasn't for the nudity that is thrown in.I'm not going to say FAST COMPANY is a bad movie because it certainly isn't but at the same time there's nothing great here either. I think the film's strongest stuff are the actors who all turn in fine performances and at least make their characters fun. Smith is extremely good in his role and he's very believable in the part and helps carry the picture. Campbell is good in his supporting role and it was nice seeing Claudia Jennings in her final film. Cedric Smith is also good in his role of the rival and Saxon is perfect playing the creep owner.The melodrama is okay but there's just not really anything here that keeps you glued to what's going on. There's some nice race car footage as well as some nice action at times but none of them really makes for a very entertaining movie. FAST COMPANY is mildly entertaining but it's easy to see why not too many people know of the film.".

I think its low rating is due to the fact that people only watch because Cronenberg did it but are disappointed that it doesn't resemble anything else he's done. And don'tjudge on that. I mean the performances are good William Smith Saxon and Claudia Jennings are all great. And there's a bunch of cool racing scenes so just enjoy. I think more people should see this but just understand its Cronenberg without exploding heads and fleshy TVs. Its just a fun movie that people should have fun with. Recommended.".

In the hands of David Cronenberg at his most lowkey and the wonderful performances of William Smith John Saxon and Claudia Jennings this is by far one of the best exploitationstyle drivein films I've seen. And it's great to see Mr. Smith being utilized in such a substantial leading role. I'm glad this film was made when it was made and with the people involved for the benefit of all the William Smith fans like myself who always wanted to see him in roles with more screen time and more dimension. And a tremendous nod to John Saxon for playing such a consummate slime ball. I believe that this film is an anthropological treasure. It's a film that must perfectly reflect the time period in which it was made and the enthusiasm of the people involved in the sport it showcased in much the same way George Lucas wanted to showcase the lost ritual of cruising in American Graffiti. Psychological and cultural aspects of the American and Canadian landscape that are disappearing. So we are fortunate to have an exploitation film which has the quality of something more artistic and thoughtful. There is some beautiful cinematography fields desolate roads tapering to vanishing points just beneath chains of snowcapped mountains dilapidated drag strips and sundry colorful seventies characters. It all seemed pretty real and more involved emotionally than many of Cronenberg's films which often have the feeling of such acute objectivity and emotional distance that you feel you're watching something closer to life evolving in a Petri dish instead of live human beings. I love Cronenberg's work by the way and that is not intended as a detraction. I think it's part of the essential weirdness of his thematic preoccupations. I give it 8 out of 10 because no film is perfect and a 910 may seem that I'm padding the score. Even if you don't enjoy drag racing or sports films check this out. It's probably the only one like it you'll ever see and by that I mean it's exceptional in the best way possible.".

	schema:reviewBody "What I found interesting about FAST COMPANY is how it doesn't fit so neatly within Cronenberg's resume and is more similar to something Roger Corman might produce. The film is essentially an insider look at dragfunny car racing although it seems that some experts consider it inaccurate regarding the sponsorship side or at least that's what actor John Saxon says in an interview for the movie of things. William Smith known primarily for his memorable heavies plays against type as a racing legend whose crew is managed by a vindictive sonofabitch John Saxon out to make money not to win. Saxon wants Smith not known to race funny cars to take over for Billy a young buck with a ton of potential because of his name recognition which might lead to more sales of his Fastco motor oil. Saxon who isn't amused with Smith's stubbornness regarding racing Billy's car decides to seek another race car driver to take the over the hill racer's place on the Fastco team. It's a battle of wills but Saxon is willing to cheat at all costs to see his business enterprise in the sport succeed no matter if it even leads to serious injury or death as a result. Nicholas Campbell is the spunky Billy The Kid Brocker who when not driving the funny car helps on the crew for Smith's Lonnie Lucky Man Johnson. Cedric Smith has a nice part as a rival of both Lonnie and Billy's Gary The Blacksmith Black not the typical scoundrel one might be accustomed to. Gary's sacrifice at the end and his general competitive swagger not to mention his dead serious attitude about winning not by nefarious means unlike his sneaky mechanic Meatball George Buza who becomes Saxon's Phil Adamson's goto guy for tampering with the Fastco car or the racetrack if necessary set him apart from what is considered the usual nemesis the viewer is supposed to root against. Judy Foster is adorable as Billy's lover Candy quite a knockout with a wattage smile. Claudia Jennings also leaves an impression as Sammy Lonnie's devoted girlfriend who would prefer him to settle down with her in Seattle Washington but is content to spend time with her man when he isn't on the road. Cronenberg allows the film to meander to tell you the truth and doesn't particularly let the story get in any hurry. The movie is ultimately a feud between owner and driver the illegal tactics of one to derail the future of the other. Saxon's Adamson is a real piece of work a backstabber and a liar with a serious superiority complex. Some nudity and fast carsCronenberg genuinely shows an interest in the inner workings of the drag racing industry especially in the auto body shop where the likes of Don Francks and Robert Haley work on the car preparing it for the big race but finds time to let two hitckhiking bimbos screw around with Billy prior to his blossoming romance with Candy. We see how Lonnie's crew suffer due to their owner's lack of initiative regarding winning and how their unwillingness to let him get the better of them results in tragic consequences when Adamson and Meatball attempt to help Gary gain an edge over the competition. Cronenberg's rabid fanbase might find this movie interesting but I felt that most of them will consider this a minor diversion not part and parcel with his horror classicks. While I admit that FAST COMPANY shows a different side to William Smith a perennial villain he seems to struggle a bit the sweet and principled character with a moral code is a role he doesn't look comfortable in. I liked his character though and was happy to see him in a changeofpace part even if he prefers to play bad guys.".

This movie is quite obviously inspired by Django although it's not an official sequel.

After Django catches up with Manuel a respect develops between the two men and Django agrees to aid the bandit in the robbery of a gold shipment. However after Manuel betrays Django and murders his girlfriend during the robbery the guilt ridden bounty hunter swears retribution...As you can tell from the synopsis this is another unofficial Django spinoff churned out in the wake of Corbucci's masterpiece. This time it is Romolo Guerrieri who tries his hand at the revenge filled saga. An overall satisfying but lesser spaghetti western with one hell of a titletranslating in English as 10000 Dollars For A Massacre. Gianni Garkobilled here as Gary Hudsonis rather compelling in his portray of Django just over a year before he would fill the boots of the enigmatic Sartana. Claudio Camaso made for a competent adversary in Manuel Vasquez but it was Fernando Sancho doing his thing as the bandit leader who really made the movie watchable. His fiery overacting and stratospheric charisma always makes me laugh. Nora Orlandi's moody score is probably the best nonMorricone composition I've ever heard and adds a pinch of Gothic to the already dramatic imagery. The action sequences lacked the necessary suspense that one expects from a spaghetti western. They were sparse and abrupt in execution but still entertaining at the very least. However the climatic showdown in the windy streets of a ghost town at twilight saved the film from a dour fate. It was in this scene that I could finally experience the blistering force of Django's angst. I concede that this sequence was a little drawn out but it was definitely among the most memorable spaghetti western faceoffs complete with the textbook OTT deaths. The dim lighting is what makes this sequence beautiful and the rest of the movie is full of interesting camera techniques. The aforementioned showdown builds to a fine ending as the soundtrack's chilling vocals roar in the background. The script was okay. The romantic subplot involving Django and his girlfriend didn't really make me feel any stronger about the characters instead it became mushy. Flashbacks would have been a better approach.An atmospheric but tepid affair Guerrieri's pastafest will never make my top 20. However it is gorgeously melodramatic and dreamlike which both work in the film's favour. 610.".

The story is also unusual while it more or less starts off with a standard spaghetti western premise it eventually goes off in some unexpected directions. Nothing immediately wrong with that but the story eventually gets to be a little boring  and you'll wonder why the hero doesn't just get down to business. The hero himself isn't totally likable by the way though he looks good compared to the villain played by Claudio Camaso who is good. While I wouldn't call this a GREAT spaghetti western it may be of interest to spaghetti western fans who want to see something that somewhat different.

That's all it aspired to be it works for the film and it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone thinking of sitting through it.On a side note I hope the same people slamming this film for its historical inaccuracies use of English and similarity to other works go slam Shakespeare next because these terms describe his most famous plays. As far as I am aware they weren't speaking Shakespearean English in 13th century Verona Italy. Anyone hear of The Tragicall History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke? Published before Shakespeare was even alive I wonder if he based Romeo and Juliet off it? Point is 10000 BC should be taken for what it is. It is two hours of Hollywood entertainment. No surprises.".

They seemed to have forgotten that prehistoric hunter gatherers generally wandered around and fill instead their days by waiting all year in their village for mammoths to meander by and kill one for food which luckily lasts all year. Their 'noble' existence is shattered by some Arab horsemen looking for slaves. They leave the Alps into the jungles ! of Italy? where they are attacked by birds which once lived in South America.

They meet some Zulu tribes who happened to have bumped into the Swiss hunter's father and who somehow managed to teach the Zulu tribe the one language that seems to exist in Europe. The Arab desert slavers have attacked the zulus too so the Swiss and the zulus combine forces to attack the slavers. Rather than follow the river the Nile? to the slave town they decide to cross the Sahara after all there's no food or water by a river so this would seem a sensible option!.After wandering around for weeks they look to the stars and decide to follow the North Star the slave city in common with Santa's hideaway is under it apparently. Hey ho after a few days they find slave city and it turns out to be a pyramid construction site led by an alien. Luckily the crafty alien god has lots of slaves and a ready source of desert living woolly mammoths to help build his pyramid. Swiss hunter cries 'operation desert freedom' and the slaves rebel. The alien god's Indian eunuchs fresh out of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doomand some albino africans flee to a giant ship stored in a pyramid but the rebelling slaves catch them up and kill the giant alien who turns out to be 'Lurch' from the Adams family. Eskimo woman then dies back in the Alps to bring Swiss hunters girlfriend back to life in the Sahara she's prophetic as shes got blue eyes  apparently rare we're led to believe in Switzerland. The film ends with the desert dwelling Zulus giving the Swiss crops which somehow grew in the Sahara. The Swiss then set off home surely cursing that they set Lurch's giant boat alight as it surely would have speeded up their journey across the Mediterranean. They have a group hug back in the Alps when their desert crops begin to grow at the foot of a glacier...Needless to say I won't be buying the DVD".

	schema:headline " Not fun not even in a cheesy sense";
	schema:reviewBody "Some critics have moaned that as film technology grows the storytelling ability of the movies shrinks. I have never quite agreed with this assessment as I believe there is a place for spectacle of any variety even the mindless kind. However to those who share the view of those critics 10000 B.C. will most likely be the most convincing piece of evidence to their argument. Here is a movie that looks like it cost millions to make but is saddled with a screenplay that looks like it came from the Dollar Store.Director and cowriter Roland Emmerich is no stranger to brainless spectacles. This is the guy who brought us Independence Day and 1998's Hollywood take on Godzilla after all. There's a very fine line between brainless and just plain brain dead unfortunately. 10000 B.C. is short on spectacle short on plot and short on just about anything that people go to the movies for. There are characters and a love story to drive the bare bones plot but this seems to be added in as an afterthought. I got the impression that Emmerich and fellow screenwriter Harald Kloser a film score composer making his first screenplay credit had the idea for a couple cool scenes then tried to add a bunch of filler material between them. They threw in some sketchy characters that hardly reach two dimensions to inhabit this filler and called it a screenplay. In order for spectacle to work even the cheesefilled variety such as this there has to be something for the audience to get excited about. This movie is just one big tease.The plot if it can even be called that is set in the days of early man. The heroes are an unnamed tribal people who speak perfect English all have the bodies of supermodels and hunt mammoths for food. The two characters we're supposed to be focused on are a pair of young lovers named D'Leh Steven Strait and Evolet Camilla Belle. Why they are in love and why we should care about them the movie never goes out of its way to explain. The rest of the villagers do not really matter. They exist simply to be captured when a group of foreign invaders come riding into their peaceful tribe and kidnap most of them to work as slaves back in their own home colony. Evolet is one of the captured so D'Leh and a small handful of others set out to find where they've been taken to and to seek the aid of other tribes that have also been invaded by this enemy. There's a mammoth herd here a saber tooth tiger there but they have nothing to do with anything. They're just computer generated special effects who are there simply because the filmmakers felt the current scene needed a special effect shot. I'd be more impressed if the effects didn't look so out of place with the actors most of the time.10000 B.C. probably would have worked better as a silent movie or a subtitled one as most of the dialogue that comes out of the mouths of these people are as wooden as the spears they carry. The good tribes are the only people in this movie who have mastered the Queen's English naturally. The evil invading tribe speak in subtitles and sometimes have their voices mechanically altered and lowered so that they sound more threatening and demonic. No one in this movie is allowed to have a personality or act differently from one another. Everybody in each tribe talks thinks and behaves exactly the same with facial hair and differing body types being the main way to tell them apart. This would make it hard to get involved in the story but the movie dodges this tricky issue by not even having a story in the first place. Once the film's main tribe is attacked the movie turns into an endless string of filler material and padding to drag the whole thing out to feature length. Aside from a brief encounter with some birdlike prehistoric creatures there are no moments of action or danger until D'Leh and his followers reach the land of the invading army. The movie throws a saber tooth tiger encounter to fool us into thinking something's gonna happen but the tiger winds up being just as boring as the human characters inhabiting the movie and is just millions in special effects budget wasted on something that didn't need to be there in the first place other than to move the shaky plot along.There is a key ingredient missing in 10000 B.C. and that is fun. This movie is not fun to watch at all. I kept on waiting for something anything to happen. When something eventually did happen it was usually underwhelming. I know of people who are interested in seeing this movie because of the special effects or because they think it looks enjoyably cheesy. To those people I say please do not be drawn in by curiosity. This isn't even enjoyable in a bad sense. Your precious time is worth more than what any theater may be charging to see this movie. For anyone wondering yes that includes the budget cinema and the price of a rental.".

	schema:headline " A visual spectacle with an unfortunate rating....another big disagreement on my part to the critics of the world";
	schema:reviewBody "I must be easily impressed. I am convinced of it or maybe I just love movies too much although there are plenty that I hate. This movie is getting skewered by professional critics and IMDb critics alike and it really does make me second guess my judgment but I've never let the crowd tell me which way to go and I'm not going to start now. I had meager expectations of 10'000 BC not really sure what to expect and I'm also a HUGE History buff and studied Sumerian religion and culture a lot in High School yes Sumerian NOT Egyptians like everyone is calling them on here. More than anything else 10'000 BC is a stunning jaw dropping spectacle from the hunting of the Mammoths to the incredible pyramid building and battles. If there was ONE thing wrong with this film it was it's rating. I am all for a family film and I'm not some nasty dude who wants blood guts and gore in everything I see but this film needed adult content. You needed to see the battle the ruggedness of their lives and the violence much like Apocalypto but I do understand wanting to keep options open to make more money. I do believe that 10'000 BC was made not as a historical grand epic that would take home awards but to make money period and it will do that I believe. There is also some common place plot holes and weird little things that could be picked apart but just sit back and watch this spectacle and just enjoy it because I think it's a masterpiece in it's own right.The cast is adequate I don't think anyone person really stuns or amazes but they are good in their respective roles. Relative newcomer Steven Strait plays the lead hero. A man who grew up believing his father abandoned his people but discovers he is destined to lead his own. He's good and watchable but doesn't light up the screen or anything and doesn't really command and huge presence on screen. Camilla Belle plays his love interest and she is stunning she really is beautiful especially with those eyes which are fake but she really is nothing more than eye candy and a damsel in distress and I think she is or could be better than that. Character actor Cliff Curtis is the elder who longs to teach Strait's character and befriends him. His character could be a lot more important and in the forefront but he's kind of quiet and foreboding and loses a lot because of it. Same goes for Affif Ben Badra who plays a villain that is taken by the lovely Belle. I almost expected some sort of redemption for his character but it never happens quite the opposite in fact. Oscar nominated veteran actor Omar Sharif is the narrator and they don't use him very much which is unfortunate.It seems like when it comes to the cast they underused a lot of potential exchanging it for visual effects but that works because the CGI is incredible. The sabertooth tiger the stunning Mammoths the pyramids the main villain or god at the Pyramids was as disturbing as ever. As for historical inaccuracy...I really don't think the film was trying for that BUT it's not as inaccurate as everyone is crying about. The villains in the film are NOT Egyptians they are Sumerians which a lot of history is mostly legend and lore and I think they do an incredible job at covering that. They even make mention of the possibility of them being from Atlantis and give a whole actual visual on them putting together the pyramids and the original face of the Sphinx which looked awful and cartoony but still... The film is about as PG as you can get never showing any skin using foul language or any brutal violence. The battle scenes are still very cool but you'll never see a close up of anyone dying so you can bring your tweens and up to see it which is good. A different spin on historical epic for everyone. Director Roland Emmerich who has done some really incredible stuff Independence Day and some very disappointing average stuff Godzilla has a real desire to do monstrous things with a budget and sometimes it will work and sometimes it won't. Don't chastise him for wanting to entertain us. He's a good director and you can see it in his style and desire to entertain. I say fight against the harsh critics because if this is the beginning of a summer blockbuster it's pretty incredible!! I loved it!! 910".

There is also some common place plot holes and weird little things that could be picked apart but just sit back and watch this spectacle and just enjoy it because I think it's a masterpiece in it's own right.The cast is adequate I don't think anyone person really stuns or amazes but they are good in their respective roles. Relative newcomer Steven Strait plays the lead hero. A man who grew up believing his father abandoned his people but discovers he is destined to lead his own. He's good and watchable but doesn't light up the screen or anything and doesn't really command and huge presence on screen. Camilla Belle plays his love interest and she is stunning she really is beautiful especially with those eyes which are fake but she really is nothing more than eye candy and a damsel in distress and I think she is or could be better than that. Character actor Cliff Curtis is the elder who longs to teach Strait's character and befriends him. His character could be a lot more important and in the forefront but he's kind of quiet and foreboding and loses a lot because of it. Same goes for Affif Ben Badra who plays a villain that is taken by the lovely Belle. I almost expected some sort of redemption for his character but it never happens quite the opposite in fact. Oscar nominated veteran actor Omar Sharif is the narrator and they don't use him very much which is unfortunate.It seems like when it comes to the cast they underused a lot of potential exchanging it for visual effects but that works because the CGI is incredible. The sabertooth tiger the stunning Mammoths the pyramids the main villain or god at the Pyramids was as disturbing as ever. As for historical inaccuracy...I really don't think the film was trying for that BUT it's not as inaccurate as everyone is crying about. The villains in the film are NOT Egyptians they are Sumerians which a lot of history is mostly legend and lore and I think they do an incredible job at covering that. They even make mention of the possibility of them being from Atlantis and give a whole actual visual on them putting together the pyramids and the original face of the Sphinx which looked awful and cartoony but still... The film is about as PG as you can get never showing any skin using foul language or any brutal violence. The battle scenes are still very cool but you'll never see a close up of anyone dying so you can bring your tweens and up to see it which is good. A different spin on historical epic for everyone. Director Roland Emmerich who has done some really incredible stuff Independence Day and some very disappointing average stuff Godzilla has a real desire to do monstrous things with a budget and sometimes it will work and sometimes it won't. Don't chastise him for wanting to entertain us. He's a good director and you can see it in his style and desire to entertain. I say fight against the harsh critics because if this is the beginning of a summer blockbuster it's pretty incredible!! I loved it!! 910";

With 40 minutes to go in the twohour film you're ready to walk out but since you've invested 80 minutes you figure I might as well see it through the end. The last half hour then becomes like a session at the dentist's office in which you can't wait for the experience to be over.Credibility is probably the worst aspect of this film. Seeing people 10000 years ago in buildings that look pretty wellmade and would do an architect proud today and hearing people speak with British and other assorted accents  in the same tribe  for the time and place Mideast or Northern Africa in 10000 B.C. almost makes one laugh out loud in spots.....yet this is supposed to be a serious movie. The specialeffects were weak especially with the sabertoothed tiger which not only looks very fake but is proportionally ludicrous. The mammoths didn't look at hokey but they moved very woodenly computerlike. This was mainly the reason I watched. I knew it might be stupid but I thought it might at least be fun with eyepopping effects. No nothing was eyepopping here.It was just dumb....and I didn't even get to the story part if you want to call it that. Actually that was the worst part of this film. The screenplay was embarrassingly bad. If you want details on the holes in this story and all the things that were impossible but shown here check out the other reviews.Folks you can believe all the negative reviews here on IMDb.

It is pelted with comments and reviews about how it is poorly written edited and played out though I am here to counter those three accusations because I like a few numbers of people thought it was enjoyable.The movie could upset many scientists or people who love and or respect history. Having mammoths in what looks like the Ice Age large Velociraptorlike birds in an immense jungle and Egyptians all in the same time era it seems like the movie just threw a whole bunch of material together. However I am always willing to accept that even with information and proof on past time eras we can never be 100 certain on anything and I judged this film not on it's historical accuracy but it's entertainment and enjoyment levels. The characters while a lot are a bit unbelievable or onedimensional all pass the time effectively and fill in for what is needed in the story. The storyline itself is probably my favorite aspect having some wonderful material to work with and really nice effects and performances from the lead man and Camilla Belle who is regarded as a horrid actress but I very well liked in this and her other work.It is nicely done in the sense that I am interested and entertained with how everything moves along and even though it seems like it is unsure on which direction it should go at some points it never jumps subject even if it does jump scenes. I do not understand Roland Emmerich though. It seems at times that he just did not want to concentrate on or deal with this film having some very poorly played out scenes. Even if I liked the way it moved along he was not as dedicated as he could have been on this movie like he was Godzilla and even The Day After Tomorrow. The movie also has some poor dialogue and some material just does not make sense but I still however stand by my approval of it. It is not as bad as many claim even if it is not amazing. It is worth the watch if you want to watch it.".

The trailer for this movie led me to expect something like Walking With Cavemen that excellent BBC documentary of 2003 except with more drama  violence or Quest for Fire a still more excellent feature film of 1981 except with better mammoths.But despite a title that recalls two previous caveman attempts  the rather laughable One Million B.C. from 1940 and the still more laughable One Million Years B.C. from 1966 that one starred Raquel Welch and her two most marketable assets  10000 B.C. is actually straightup science fiction. And that's not a bad thing at all.This movie has plenty of action plenty of CGI gorgeous location photography from Africa and New Zealand a durable quest narrative and a hunky leading man in the form of Steven Strait selfdoubting mammoth hunter. The producers make some nice gestures toward Ice Age realism with their portrayal of the encampment of the mammoth hunters who have cool dreadlocks like most folks in prehistoric movies nowadays cool face paint fancy bone weapons  jewelry and appropriately furry garments.There's a lot that the producers get wrong periodwise. Ice Age hunters didn't live in large groups they didn't live in permanent villages and they certainly didn't spend the winter up in the mountains duh. The mammothhunting techniques that we see seem highly dubious also. Still worse the scenario is geographically challenged  there's no way anyone could walk from alpine mountains to East Asian bamboo jungles to subSaharan Africa over the course of a few weeks.Most annoying to Anglophone viewers will probably be the funny accents. I mean we all know that nobody spoke English ten thousand years ago and we're all very comfortable with the convention of portraying cinematic Romans and Spartans not to mention hobbits and elves! as speaking English instead of their true languages. So what not have Delay  his people just talk like ordinary Americans? Instead they're given this silly Middle EasternMiddle European accent that sounds like bad Middle1960s dubbing.But that's a small quibble. The most important point here is that 10000 B.C. is really a homage to the pulp adventures published in Weird Tales during the 1920s and 1930s. In this film we're very much in the territory of Robert E. Howard author of the Conan stories and Edgar Rice Burroughs creator of Tarzan Barsoom and the lost world of the cavemen At the Earth's Core. Because once the story gets rolling we discover that the mammoth hunters have predatory neighbors whose technology horseback riding bows and arrows sailing ships woven cloth monumental architecture in dressed stone is thousands of years ahead of theirs.Some say they came from the stars or from a land that sank beneath the sea. Aha! What we have here is a lost colony from Atlantis. Exactly the kind that Howard and Burroughs and their many Depressionera imitators loved to write about. Once the Atlantis thing kicks in you know that evil priests false gods ancient prophecies human sacrifice and a slave rebellion are all in store. See Atlantis the Lost Continent 1961 for more of what I'm talking about. And in this regard 10000 B.C. does not disappoint.In the end this film resembles nothing so much as an unauthorized prequel to Stargate. It's a great Saturday matine.".

Without a lot talent good actors suspense drama. Actually I'm not completely honest. There was a part of the movie when the audience got tense. You could feel a sort of tension in the air. People on the edge of their seats. Something was going to happen on the screen... all of a sudden... the end of the movie yes. The flow of people rushing out happy to be delivered happy to go back to their lives.The highlight of the evening the previews. It looks like some pretty funny stuff is coming out soon.".

I feel like I understand my role in the great destiny of mankind to warm people not to watch this piece of garbage.It is true that this movie is somewhat the same than Apocalypto. Without a lot talent good actors suspense drama. Actually I'm not completely honest. There was a part of the movie when the audience got tense. You could feel a sort of tension in the air. People on the edge of their seats. Something was going to happen on the screen... all of a sudden... the end of the movie yes. The flow of people rushing out happy to be delivered happy to go back to their lives.The highlight of the evening the previews. It looks like some pretty funny stuff is coming out soon.";

	schema:reviewBody "Although well shot in front of gorgeous vistas on location in New Zealand Namibia and South Africa 10000 BC is just another loud dumb and eminently pointless CGI adventure from the tactless talentless hacky direction of Roland Emmerich.Theres a plot believe it or not something about the true love between some tribesman and a hot chick set in the very distant past and these rampaging marauders attack their peaceful prehistoricera tribe and carry off the womenfolk so our hero spends the next two hours of movie time trying to get her back.But who cares right? No one in his right mind would watch a Roland Emmerich movie for the plot. The man brought us Godzilla Independence Day and The Day after Tomorrow after all. No your focus here is supposed to be on the prehistoricness of the thing like the wild carnivorous birds or the mastodons or the sabretooth tigers. Oh and the smoldering hotness of lurve that Our Hero and His Love can barely contain.Your first clue that this wont be much more than a silly bore is the simple fact that our noble hunters speak perfect inflectionless English. No idea why. Im not the biggest fan of subtitles granted but I think here they at least would have made sense. Instead we have these perfectly coiffed young people with gleaming white teeth  as any prehistoric hunter would have  speaking the Queens English to each other. Its bizarre and offputting. These cool kids look like they fell out of a Gap commercial theyd be dead in minutes if they actually had to fend for themselves on a tundra or in the jungle. Theyre as believable as Ed Begley Jr. at a biker rally. Which is not very believable.And its not as if they get clever intelligent dialog to mouth. DLeh heh sounds like Delay tells a vicious trapped sabretooth tiger Do not eat me when I set you free! See because he doesnt want to be eaten and he figures that reasoning with the beast will do the trick. DLeh played by newcomer Steven Strait is sort of a poor mans Colin Farrell complete with otherworldly eyebrows. He wants you to think hes earnest and sincere but instead you think hes vapid and vain. Crazy! Do not eat me when I set you free! Thats hilarious right there. Why its right up there with Throw me the whip and Ill throw you the idol! Besides this whole pursuingthesavageswhostoleourpeople thing was done much better only a few years ago in Mel Gibsons Apocalpyto. Now you might not buy into the notion of using an ancient Mayan dialect in a movie but at least it made some sense. Using that dialect with subtitles there was a real sense of adventure and tragedy here the fluid English feels woefully inept and completely anachronistic.Unlike Apocalypto theres scant fighting and mayhem here. The tribe like that in Apocalypto is a hunting tribe so that explains why for much of the movie they run and hide and duck and cover. I will find you! Whats his name cries. And then he finds her and then loses her again and he says Ill come back! And then he spends the next hour or so trying to find her. His One True Love is like a set of pretty car keys.Back to that tiger which makes a couple of appearances. Now I like CGI as much as the next guy. It can very easily enhance a scene make the unrealistic seem obvious and believable. But this tiger reminded me of the cyclops and other fantastical creatures youd see in those old fifties Greekepic movies the ones featuring the work of the great Ray Harryhausen  basically essentially stopmotion animation. And that looks crappy here in good ol 2008.10000 BC isnt meant to be a historical epic  the year 10000 BC is used here merely to connote a Long Time Ago  which is fine in and of itself but really isnt anything compelling about it other than its setting. Its predictable pap without much of a heart instilling no compassion or feeling from its audience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Coming off some rather poor reviews I expected failure from this movie and the first ten minutes delivered all the fail I anticipated. After that it drastically improved and while it didn't succeed as an epic it was very lively and highly imaginative.Starting with the bad most of the dialogue just plain sucks. It's great that they tried to make the people sound simple being this is 10000 BC but the kids D'leh and Evolet had these really painfully Arabesquire accents and awkward dialogue reminiscent of Attack of the Clones Padme and Anakin. The dumb little kid who follows the hunters also is an embarrassing addition but thankfully his dialogue is limited.The minor characters such as the Englishspeaking African chief are the only characters who really shine with their simplistic dialogue and even D'leh sometimes narrowly misses having his lines crumble to sheer stupidity.Also a major detractment is the narrator who is mostly completely unneeded save to further some events. Other times we really don't need to hear him such as the very end when the Old Mother supposedly 'breathes life' into Evolet. The images showed this clearly enough without needless narration.In the beginning the special effects are rather poor as you can very clearly see that a character doesn't fit in the background environment as if they were filmed in front of a green screen and then attempts at digitally removing the green glare only smeared the picture.Also it was clearly not necessary to have the ice people of D'leh speak English as they are the only Englishspeaking tribe in the movie and it would have far better served the atmosphere to have them speaking a more primitive language with more hand and facial gestures than verbosity.The action sequences costumes cinematography and sets were spectacular and managed to tell the greater story oppressed tribes banding together to overthrow a tyrant in a way that far supersedes the main individual story of D'leh trying to save Evolet though from the prophetic viewpoint it was interesting how they twisted the two together having it be that only D'leh's desire to save Evolet could make him lead the tribes to freedom. To sum the movie succeeds in macrostorytelling but fails in microstorytelling.As for the historical accuracy... it's very imaginative. And it requires you to use your imagination to explain certain things.For one the pyramids in what is clearly Egypt. I thought it was a great explanation to show them using Mammoths to pull their limestone since even today historians are marveled at how they could have pulled such stones with manpower alone and though the first pyramids were built some 7000 years after this movie takes place the movie makes sure that it is left open to interpretation.What? The pyramids are barely halfway completed in the movie and the slaves and tribes revolt against their ruler a tall godlike figure who must maintain his illusion of divinity to a point of never being seen his personal slaves are all blind leaving the pyramids incomplete. You could easily imagine that the pyramids could left incomplete for thousands of years before a civilization known to us as the Egyptians of hieroglyphs and mummies worked to complete them. Sands could have eroded the pyramids covering them up completely or who knows? The movie doesn't definitively say the pyramids were built in 10000 BC only that they were begun and presumably not completed by the original builders.In all it's a beautifully done movie which suffers from poor microstorytelling. If the total story were in the forefront and the love story reduced to a subplot I think it would have been a far better movie.".

But with 10000 BC...I'm torn.....because the sheer amount of garbage in this film leaves me at a lose as to where to begin....I guess it's best to start out with the film's biggest flaw it fails to do ANYTHING a movie should do. It fails to excite it fails to intrigue it fails to stimulate in any way. I actually fell asleep for a few minutes in the theater which I have NEVER done before. The story is so awful it's embarrassing. The guys that do Scary Movie can and actually have made better scripts. It's clich and recycled to the point that other movies could win a copyright suit. Some guy if there were names to any of these characters I couldn't tell you what any of them are falls in love with a girl that shows up in his village. Then a bunch of guys come kidnap her and a bunch of other cutout nameless characters which we were apparently supposed to remember cause they have lines later on and I think one of them gets killed. So the guy gets his best friend and some other dude to come with him to get the girl back. Essentially it's just an old overdone journey across the world story that you know is just gonna end in some big climactic battle and a passionate kiss.Sure enough this is what the story is. However it actually takes that paper thin concept and makes it WORSE. Character development is nonexistent as well as all logic. Apparently preventing a sabertooth tiger from drowning will make it not kill you because that's how nature works. The movie starts off slightly foolish but as it moves on it gets increasingly ridiculous and by the time we reach the final fight all sense of realism has been tossed out the window. Original concepts seemed to be unavailable to these writers. The way in which the good guy kills the almighty bad guy is such a deliberate ripoff of 300 myself and others actually cried out in the theater with disgust. The whole fiasco is wrapped up with one of the most blatant unbelievable uses of deus ex machina I've ever witnessed.Let's take a look at history according to this movie. In the year 10000 BC they were capable of working metal to make things such as daggers jail cells and a giant gold pyramids. Everyone was fully clothed nothing dangles or hangs out in the prehistoric world. Also absolutely everyone is ripped. Not like in 300 were all the warriors are muscle bound and fit while old people and normal people look like old people and normal people in 10000 BC absolutely everyone is ripped and thin and tan. People also looked exactly the same as they do today evolution was already done. Facial hair apparently does not grow and getting a full body wax was typical of everyone. Bad guys had such wonderful tools at their hands such as full maps compasses and metal telescopes. Among dozens of different indigenous tribes and millions of different people there were two languages everyone shared and one black guy with sabertooth tiger ear rings is capable of translating everyone's speech. Need I go on?Let's talk action. It's rated PG13 that should say everything you need to know about the gore of the fights. There's an action sequence with a mammoth one with a tiger one with giant killer birds and then a fight at the end. All are bland all are weak and so the movie fails on all levels. I'd also like to point out that the sabertooth tiger looked like something out of World of Warcraft.Yes I'm ranting now but it's all I can do. The sheer awfulness of this movie is difficult to restrain there's just so much to be upset with. But the only thing that really needs to be said is that this is should be considered the worst movie of 2008 thus far and stay far faaaaaaaaar away from it in theaters. I would recommend seeing it once it's on DVD get it from your library don't rent it if not simply so you can bear witness to this legendary piece of garbage and see for yourself what I'm talking about.".

However as a big fan of Camille Belle I fortunately decided to see this underrated adventure. The entertaining story is a combination of Apocalypto Quest for Fire and Stargate with a romantic situation supported by magnificent CGI and action scenes.

I just don't see why people complain about this being historically inaccurate. There is one thing i would say if someone said that to me IT'S a MOVIE it's fake it's made up it is not real! I also like how they insinuated that the almighty and his people were possibly from the city of Atlantis.Also the action scenes with the creatures like the giant birds were very well done. As said before AMAZING CGI.One thing i didn't like were the white teeth other that it's a very cool epic action flick.Most of the audience gave an applaus at theend of the movie too.Great epic film 1010".

It takes elements from all other fantasyscifiepics and is so clich'd its an absolute train wreck. Is it an epic? NO. A monster  dinosaur movie? No. Is it a thinly veiled romanctic film akin to Braveheart? NO Is it a gore fest? No. The CGI is NOT that good and rather uninspired. I'd rewatch Jurassic Park and still be in awe compared to this. This movie never made up what it wanted to be. Not that it ever got that far. The climax which is perhaps the only redeeming factor ends so horrifically stupid. It has terrific production values and costume design. Kudos for those...everything else is unremarkable what a waste.".

Want more ripoffs...how about King Leonidas spear throw on Xeres? Seen it seen it seen it!!!Maybe Roland was paying tribute to the genre but I seriously doubt it. Makes us miss Astronaut Taylor  Nova heck even Beastmaster Dar  Kiri all did it so much better.Anyway the 1 star is for Evolet for teasing us throughout.After 2 hours the audience was groaning having endured 10000 clichs.And if you're thinking about waiting for the DVD save your hard earned money because nothing can save this Mammoth Razzie!".

	schema:reviewBody "Guys I'm not trying to sound cheese but i'm sick and tired of the negative reviews for this great film. Every scene had a meaning in it and i was definitely mesmerized by the entire story and the way the characters are played. It is 10000 BC therefore it is not an evolution of characters. that's the beauty of it. the tribe is there and the people hunt. the main point is that they stick to gather and hunt together. Now to convey this point does not require one to write a Kafkaesque type story.The entire story is about sacrifice friendship loyalty and love.Next the simplicity of the life is shown so well wait for the mammoths to come have fun and fear in the hunt and then get the bride. In our present culture of nth degree hectic life this is very pleasantly disarmingly simple and sublime.Next the traitor is considered a traitor. When one leaves a tribe it is dishonorable. DLeh's dad left and that alienated others to DLeh. That is loyalty. Now tell me in this culture of changing jobs at the drop of a hat this concept is alien. But DLeh dad left because he wanted to save the tribe and he does not want others to die off by following him in his quest for nowhere. That is sacrifice.The helpless before people with superior weapons is shown in a poignant manner. When the four legged beasts attack the tribe people get killed and the survivors cry but faces and not forgotten baku the child does not forget his mom's killer there is vengeance and anger in his heart but he is helpless being a child and his good friend later in the movie who was also abducted for slavery. His dad helps him find justice. Slavery. Yes the movie is about it. Its about powerful gods and their four legged beasts who want to build monuments. Does it sound familiar?The movie is about powerful stimuli signals. There are thousands and thousands of slaves building the tower and a few overlords. But once the horn is given they all bow. Just think of it no savior no helper in chains and fearing the god who could destroy them. Powerful powerful portrayal. No one was able to stand up. Then Dleh for Love's sake want to pursue the four legged beasts. And others join. Why do they join?? Because of the thing called Loyalty. Does anyone know anything about it To go and pursue more powerful beings then ourselves and supporting a friend that is what the movie is about.Dleh does not want to keep the white spear is because he felt a Man's shame. A good man does not ride on false glory he is Honorable and does not take false glory though all the tribe believes that he single handedly killed the mammoth. Even if it means to lose Evolet. Foreign foreign concept now and days.But he still loves her. So they trek out. They cross the lands. And the sabertooth oh how great was that scene. The myth says no one can talk to a saber tooth because it is the biggest beast. If one talks then he is the one to lead them Given it is impossible and myth of the centuries so it is just told as a folk lore. But now they see Dleh talk and Lo and Behold this legend spreads and everyone is strengthed to join and fight the godsDleh was not brave but he was willing to die for his love. He was just like us weak having misgivings about many things want to turn back. But that's the beauty of the movie. It reminded me of Harry Potter.And they were great coincidences. It is as if Alternate history could be written. If Dleh did not help the saber tooth. The tribe would have killed him.If evolet did not leave the clues for Dleh in hope and nothing but hope. She would not have been hit so badly on her hands. And then the priest of the gods would not have measured the wounds and then there is no Hunter.It was all well woven simply superb. What a great movie. I could go on and onperhaps I will later..".

Who would of thought the prehistoric era can be thrilling and exciting also films about it. I also love the ethnic drums and vocalizations in the soundtrack.The film starts in a remote central Eurasian mountain range home to a tribe of huntergatherers called the Yaghal who survive by trapping and killing mammoths. Here the young hunter D'Leh who had found his heart's desire in the beautiful named Evolet....I like the sound of that name. When another band of mysterious horseriding warlords raid the Yaghal camp and kidnapped Evolet along with many others from the village D'Leh is forced to lead a small group of hunters south to pursue the warlords to the end of their known world to save her. Driven by destiny the unlikely band of rescuing warriors must battle terror birds in the Levant and D'Leh saved a sabertoothed cat from a hunter's pit. Along their journey they meet other tribes of warriors who have also had loved ones kidnapped by the marauding horsemen. Together they form a coalition and march in pursuit of the captors. At their heroic journey's end through a vast desert they discover a mysterious civilization ruled by a enigmatic godlike figure known as the Almighty who is said to be the last survivor of his kind. Their ultimate fate lies in a city of slaves who toil to serve a being regarded as a living god the Almighty who has ordered the construction of three colossal pyramids. D'Leh manages to rally them together and the slaves join him and his army who have infiltrated the city in a revolt against the Almighty.Overall I love this film. My dad loves it too.".

The boat sailing down the nile was wonderful. The special effects were good. The story although simple was logical. I liked the Atlantis theme and I would have liked to see more of their backstory.

	schema:reviewBody "What we have here is a fantastic classic horror film which benefits from great performances from all concerned and a plot not typical of serial killer films. The film doesn't adhere to convention and builds its story around an idea that was frightening for the time  and still is to this day. The murderer in this film is as evil as any other the only difference being that here the killings are committed by a decidedly amoral child. The film presents a good portrait of its star as it presents its ideas very much from a child's point of view. The young girl doesn't see what she's doing as wrong as she is always given a reason to pass on the blame for wrongdoings and this always comes across in a plausible way. The plot surrounding the atrocities is even more interesting than the central idea as we follow the torment inflicted on the girl's mother. The situation that Christine Penmark finds herself in is the stuff of nightmares just what can you do if you find that your eight year old child has committed murder? The Bad Seed makes excellent use of this dilemma and the fact that it's incredibly easy to buy into the plot ensures that The Bad Seed prevails as an potently chilling film.The film is based on a stage play by Maxwell Anderson and this comes across often as the film takes place in just a few settings and the whole thing is very stagy. This is however to its benefit as the locations make the whole piece more claustrophobic and the fact that we don't see the murders themselves benefits the film immensely as it allows the audience to spend more time considering the implications which are what the film is actually about. The main reason why this film works so well is down to a great performance by talented child actor Patricia McCormack. McCormack presents a portrayal that finds exactly the right pitch between the sweet and innocent youngster that she appears and the dark persona that lies just beneath her exterior. Nancy Kelly similarly gives a defining performance as her tortured mother and excellently puts across a torrent of emotion. The acting is typically melodramatic but all the cast somehow manage to keep their acting down to earth. Every scene in the movie is perfectly pitched and nothing is wasted as we are continually taught more about the characters and their situations. The climax to the film is fabulously poetic despite being implemented on the producer's orders and overall I really don't see much wrong with this film. Highly recommended!".

	schema:headline " Staginess is not a flaw here";
	schema:reviewBody "Christine Penmark Nancy Kelly is the daughter of a famous writer Richard Bravo Paul Fix. She's married to Kenneth William Hopper a military Colonel who seems to spend most of his time away from home usually on shortterm call in some other city. The landlady of their apartment building Monica Breedlove Evelyn Varden is obsessed with psychology having even been analyzed by Freud. Because of this she courts friendships with other intellectuals including a criminology author Reginald Tasker Gage Clarke. But by far the most important character is Christine's young daughter Rhoda Patricia McCormick.Rhoda is oddly adult in her behavior. She goes out of her way to excel at everything she does to be prim and proper to seem amicable and innocent. However in the wake of one of Rhoda's classmates falling victim to a drowning accident while on a school picnic suspicion falls on Rhoda. As more facts come out Christine realizes with horror that her child just might be a bad seed.A tightly focused ensemble piece heavy on dialogue and taking place primarily in one interior location The Bad Seed is one of the better but more understated horror films from the 1950s. Because of its ideas its unusual portrayal of a manipulatively evil child and a weirdly cute young girl at that and its nihilistic and abruptly mindblowing ending The Bad Seed was quite a shocking film in 1956. In my book it still is. That's not to say that the film is graphic. Much more so than say The Haunting 1963 The Bad Seed is the classic example of how something implied and not shown can be just as effective and disturbing as something shown.Still not everyone loves it of course. Staginess is often cited with either a direct claim or an implication that that quality is necessarily a flaw. The Bad Seed's staginess is easily explicable. It is a film adaptation of a play by Maxwell Anderson which was itself adapted from William March's last novel published in 1954. It's easy to see how only minor changes would allow the film to be performed on a stage. However I don't see The Bad Seed's staginess as a flaw. It's not as if plays are bad merely for the fact that they're plays right? There seems to be some unspoken or unanalyzed attendant assumption that cinema shouldn't bear strong similarities to other artistic media andor a belief that cinema should always be naturalistic. I don't agree with either of those assumptions. Cinema can do many different things. It shouldn't all just be one way or another.Rather than being a flaw the staginess of The Bad Seed is an asset. It catalyzed the effective tell don't show attitude towards the film's violence. It allows all attention to be placed on the fantastic ensemble performances and especially on McCormack who turns in the best young female performance this side of Dakota Fanning. And it helps make the film feel like the parable that it is.Under director Mervyn LeRoy's hand The Bad Seed is an extended meditation on two philosophical ideastwisted psychologies and the nature versus nurture debate.

Characters debate this to an extent but most take the nurture side. However the film itself makes more of an argument for the nature side and Christine despite being in denial comes to believe the nature side as does Reginald the evenkeeled character. In fact William March the author of the novel believed more in the nature side and said as much to colleagues while he was working on the book including doing research into psychotic killers.What helps to amp up the disturbing qualities of the film is that Rhoda is manipulating the audience as well as she is manipulating other characters. Only very seldom does LeRoy have her true nature come through and it's a shock to us in the same way that it's a shock to the other characters. The ending of the book was changed to be in line with the moral code for Hollywood films at the time but the resultant somewhat bizarre ending is probably more shocking in retrospect than March's original ending would have been. There have been many horror films over the years with endings somewhat similar to March's. There haven't been many that end in quite the same way that The Bad Seed does.While the film would certainly require a bit of adjustment for many younger modern horror fans it is well worth watching especially if you've become acclimated to slowerpaced dramatic understated horror.".

	onyx:emotionText "Christine Penmark Nancy Kelly is the daughter of a famous writer Richard Bravo Paul Fix. She's married to Kenneth William Hopper a military Colonel who seems to spend most of his time away from home usually on shortterm call in some other city. The landlady of their apartment building Monica Breedlove Evelyn Varden is obsessed with psychology having even been analyzed by Freud. Because of this she courts friendships with other intellectuals including a criminology author Reginald Tasker Gage Clarke. But by far the most important character is Christine's young daughter Rhoda Patricia McCormick.Rhoda is oddly adult in her behavior. She goes out of her way to excel at everything she does to be prim and proper to seem amicable and innocent. However in the wake of one of Rhoda's classmates falling victim to a drowning accident while on a school picnic suspicion falls on Rhoda. As more facts come out Christine realizes with horror that her child just might be a bad seed.A tightly focused ensemble piece heavy on dialogue and taking place primarily in one interior location The Bad Seed is one of the better but more understated horror films from the 1950s. Because of its ideas its unusual portrayal of a manipulatively evil child and a weirdly cute young girl at that and its nihilistic and abruptly mindblowing ending The Bad Seed was quite a shocking film in 1956. In my book it still is. That's not to say that the film is graphic. Much more so than say The Haunting 1963 The Bad Seed is the classic example of how something implied and not shown can be just as effective and disturbing as something shown.Still not everyone loves it of course. Staginess is often cited with either a direct claim or an implication that that quality is necessarily a flaw. The Bad Seed's staginess is easily explicable. It is a film adaptation of a play by Maxwell Anderson which was itself adapted from William March's last novel published in 1954. It's easy to see how only minor changes would allow the film to be performed on a stage. However I don't see The Bad Seed's staginess as a flaw. It's not as if plays are bad merely for the fact that they're plays right? There seems to be some unspoken or unanalyzed attendant assumption that cinema shouldn't bear strong similarities to other artistic media andor a belief that cinema should always be naturalistic. I don't agree with either of those assumptions. Cinema can do many different things. It shouldn't all just be one way or another.Rather than being a flaw the staginess of The Bad Seed is an asset. It catalyzed the effective tell don't show attitude towards the film's violence. It allows all attention to be placed on the fantastic ensemble performances and especially on McCormack who turns in the best young female performance this side of Dakota Fanning. And it helps make the film feel like the parable that it is.Under director Mervyn LeRoy's hand The Bad Seed is an extended meditation on two philosophical ideastwisted psychologies and the nature versus nurture debate. It's not just Rhoda who has psychologicallyrooted problems and dysfunctions but everyone in the film. Christine is in denial and shows that she has long been in denial about her happiness her life and her daughter. She continually tries to act as if everything is kosher and normal but as the film progresses she has periodic cracks in the armor until the breakdown at the endand even in the midst of that she tries to act as if everything is okay and mundane. Monica who keeps trying to psychoanalyze everyone except the one person she most needs to psychoanalyze tends to also intellectually browbeat or overpower them. Kenneth is an absentee husband.

	schema:headline " Though Flawed and Stagy Still Chilling After all These Years  Part One";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw The Bad Seed years ago circa 1970 for the first time and have seen it periodically over the years. When I first saw the film as a child I found the film expectedly quite chilling. I saw it again this afternoon after not having seen it for about three years and still find it quite disturbing. Now that we have IMDb I decided to offer my thoughts. And so I was shocked to find SO MANY comments about it...more than for any other film that I've reviewed on IMDb to date. If I add anything of unique value great. If not I'm happy to share my review anyway.Certainly there are flaws or perhaps only unique differences in this film. Primarily it can very easily be considered a filmed play as the staging the dialog and the entrances and exits of the characters throughout the film seem to be lifted directly from the stage version. Therefore some may find the film a bit too sterile or unnatural in many ways. However I think it is this very sterile staged starkfromaproductionstandpoint quality that gives the film an even eerier and in some ways far more realistic edge than might be found were it to be produced today for film with far more slick and sophisticated sets dialog camera work etc. The realism and pronounced disturbing quality of this version stems from the simple story itself the psychological horror of which could be in some ways obfuscated from a much more sophisticated bigstudio modernday production. As for the subject matter itself I know that the number of cases historically involving child murderers is actually low. Therefore some critics have argued that to take a relatively rare phenomenon such as the child murderer and build a motion picture around it portraying it in the vein of plausibility can be misleading and dangerous giving the impression especially to younger viewers that child criminals are more commonplace than you may think. I wholeheartedly reject this notion. The whole purpose of acting is to portray the entire range of the human condition with as much truth as possible no matter how rare or commonplace certain aspects of human behavior might be. Though child murderers may be few in number it's an area worthy of as much exploration in film as is an ugly unrealistic alien telling us to phone home or the sinking of the Titanic. Even though this film possesses a definite campy staged and perhaps even cult quality it is chillingly effective. One reason for which this film works is due to the character of Rhoda herself played by Patty McCormack. The smiling blond blueeyed veneer of the child juxtaposed with the idea of her criminal potential and actions is just plain creepy. Moreover the less you see in terms of the actual crimes she commits the more you conjure. And you continually wonder who her next victim will be. Furthermore you wonder how many people will eventually come on to her and become aware of whom she is and how that knowledge will affect their fate.Another reason for which this film works is because of the mother Christine played by Nancy Kelly. As we slowly watch her become aware of what has become of her daughter we can't help but empathize with her predicament and her decision in handling it. The first few times I saw the film just as I felt that Patty McCormack's portrayal and dialog delivery were probably mere replicas of what she offered on stage I felt that Nancy Kelly's performance was affected and probably lifted directly from her work on the stage I've never seen a stage version nor have I read the book yet. But in the case of Ms. Kelly watching her realize what she has ultimately given birth to and raised is very heart wrenching. Moreover I have always wondered if the use of her right hand was a direction given to her by either of her directors for play or film or if it was something she came up with herself. Two instances come to mind. In the first one the manner in which she hits the table with her right hand as she listens to what is happening outside near her shed while Rhoda plays Au Claire de la Lune on her piano is very pronounced appears somewhat odd and is perhaps symbolic. She seemed to be pounding her hand not only in outward denial and anger at the realization she now has of what her child is capable of committing but as a means to torture and punish herself for having given birth to her in the first place. In the second instance Nancy Kelly used her right hand again in a very pronounced manner when she offers Rhoda her vitamins that night. Again I couldn't help but wonder what symbolism she wanted us to draw from her gesture. It might be said that this very hand which once comforted and fed her child all her life has now become the tool that feeds the ultimate fate of her child toward the end of the film. Again not having read it I have a fairly good idea how the book ends.As for how the endingepilogue in the film was handled practically everyone on this site who has offered a review knows that the use of the casting call was basically dictated by the mandates of the Hays Code. I'll just add that I find that the chilling effect of the story carries over to this bizarre epilogue. I still find it a bit unsettling to see each of these actors take their bows especially considering that some of the characters they portrayed would in my estimation appear stranger to a child than does Rhoda....particularly Leroy when he bows to the viewing audience carrying his large pitchfork.".

	schema:headline " What Rhoda Wants Rhoda Gets";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a movie that stands the test of time because of the period in which it was filmed its methods of filming and acting and the level of knowledge of the subject matter at that time. It is truly a period piece and as such it is a powerful chillerthriller.A hit on Broadway 'The Bad Seed' was translated into film as though it were a play hence various commentators speak of its staginess and sometimes overwrought acting as if they were serious objections to the enjoyability of the movie. But does anyone complain that 'Dracula' was stagy and overwrought? No because the movie is classic in and of itself and so is 'The Bad Seed'.Translate your mind back to the early nineteenfifties and 'The Bad Seed' takes on new levels of meaning and challenge. Christine Penrose whose military husband is called away from home is raising her darling daughter Rhoda on her own when things start slowly coming apart. Rhoda is the perfect eightyearold a pretty intelligent and very affectionate child in crinoline dresses and blonde braids to whom everyone around gives praise and often gifts. She is always grateful and loving in her delight with what she gets. What is wrong with this picture? Rhoda wants something very badly something she feels she won and has been unjustly denied something that disappeared when its owner died a sudden tragic death. So why does it turn up in Rhoda's possessions? Christine Penmark has no idea what is going on. Children were not believed to have mature personalities according to the psychology of the day and the case of Leopold and Loeb was brutal and startling and apparently a singular aberration just a few years before the play debuted. There was then no way to explain what Christine begins to perceive that Rhoda takes what she wants if she can't charm her way to it and anyone who gets in her way she simply 'removes'. This wasn't supposed to happen in the 1950's. Today we may be more reliably informed especially to the statistics that point clearly to the 'nurture rather than nature' explanation but Christine is alone with her manipulative little murderess with no worldview to encompass what she faces. Her confusion and denial aren't weaknesses of character but the product of the general understanding of the day.It is not until she has a chance encounter with a criminal psychologist who posits the 'nature not nurture' theory of criminality and then digs more deeply into the dark secret of her own childhood that things begin to add up and Christine Penmark herself unravels in as ghastly a manner as her life has done.The play is in black and white and so are the performances and the ethics and morality of its message. Rhoda has only two sides to her the apparently good affectionate perfect angel and the manifestly evil selfish deadly crocodilebrained killer. Patty MacCormack is excellent in the dual portrayal and her performance as a child actress is an achievement seldom rivaled and never bettered.Nancy Kelly's utter devastation step by step is carefully crafted and touched with a dread terror that recognizes though never states that Christine knows that she herself is not safe around Rhoda let alone anyone else.

	onyx:emotionText "This is a movie that stands the test of time because of the period in which it was filmed its methods of filming and acting and the level of knowledge of the subject matter at that time. It is truly a period piece and as such it is a powerful chillerthriller.A hit on Broadway 'The Bad Seed' was translated into film as though it were a play hence various commentators speak of its staginess and sometimes overwrought acting as if they were serious objections to the enjoyability of the movie. But does anyone complain that 'Dracula' was stagy and overwrought? No because the movie is classic in and of itself and so is 'The Bad Seed'.Translate your mind back to the early nineteenfifties and 'The Bad Seed' takes on new levels of meaning and challenge. Christine Penrose whose military husband is called away from home is raising her darling daughter Rhoda on her own when things start slowly coming apart. Rhoda is the perfect eightyearold a pretty intelligent and very affectionate child in crinoline dresses and blonde braids to whom everyone around gives praise and often gifts. She is always grateful and loving in her delight with what she gets. What is wrong with this picture? Rhoda wants something very badly something she feels she won and has been unjustly denied something that disappeared when its owner died a sudden tragic death. So why does it turn up in Rhoda's possessions? Christine Penmark has no idea what is going on. Children were not believed to have mature personalities according to the psychology of the day and the case of Leopold and Loeb was brutal and startling and apparently a singular aberration just a few years before the play debuted. There was then no way to explain what Christine begins to perceive that Rhoda takes what she wants if she can't charm her way to it and anyone who gets in her way she simply 'removes'. This wasn't supposed to happen in the 1950's. Today we may be more reliably informed especially to the statistics that point clearly to the 'nurture rather than nature' explanation but Christine is alone with her manipulative little murderess with no worldview to encompass what she faces. Her confusion and denial aren't weaknesses of character but the product of the general understanding of the day.It is not until she has a chance encounter with a criminal psychologist who posits the 'nature not nurture' theory of criminality and then digs more deeply into the dark secret of her own childhood that things begin to add up and Christine Penmark herself unravels in as ghastly a manner as her life has done.The play is in black and white and so are the performances and the ethics and morality of its message. Rhoda has only two sides to her the apparently good affectionate perfect angel and the manifestly evil selfish deadly crocodilebrained killer. Patty MacCormack is excellent in the dual portrayal and her performance as a child actress is an achievement seldom rivaled and never bettered.Nancy Kelly's utter devastation step by step is carefully crafted and touched with a dread terror that recognizes though never states that Christine knows that she herself is not safe around Rhoda let alone anyone else. Her response to that knowledge is telling she is the mother of a murderess after all.The performances of Henry Jones as the unsavory handyman the audience ends up wanting Rhoda to put out of our misery and Eileen Heckart as the bereft and alcoholic mother of Rhoda's dead schoolmate are both standouts.

Heckart repeated her stage role in the 1956 film with Nancy Kelly and Patty McCormack as the mother and daughter. Henry Jones also in the stage production and excellent Evelyn Varden Gage Clarke Paul Fix Joan Croyden and Jesse White are good in support. Jones and Varden are especially good. William Hopper is and always was BLAH. But Eileen Heckart is superb as the drunken crushed woman who knows there is something more to her son's death than she is being told. Her two scenes are riveting as she lurches across the room begging for information yet totally in control of the situation. Kelly McCormack Jones and Varden are also good if stagy in their roles. Kelly seems hopelessly hammy but grows on you even though she seems to be imitating Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard most of the time. Great film literate interesting riveting..... a must!".

	schema:reviewBody "THERE ARE SPOILERS HERE What a flock of moral conundrums this little movie throws at us. Rhoda is every bit a little girl. She is not evil. Basically no one has to fear turning hisher back on the child. Well almost no one the point being she was never out looking for a victim. SPOILER This is the key point that LeRoy Henry Jones misunderstood about her which proved to be a fatal mistake. He thought he could see right through her because he thought she was just plain bad like him. She wasn't bad in the normal way of things. She loved her dolls and toys. She loved to read fantasies and have her mother read to her at bedtime. She loved to play imaginary hostess with her new tea set. She loved for adults to make over her. BIG SPOILERS AHEAD In this story there are three people we know she has killed. The little boy who won the penmanship medal she felt she was more deserving of. Old Mrs. Post in Baltimore who promised the girl her fish bowl when she died. And of course Leroy who threatened her. She was capable of great lies when pressed for motivations but was unafraid and even forthcoming if her cover collapsed. To her there were very logical reasons for her acts. SPOILER That's what LeRoy missed. Had he realized that when she had reason she would stop at nothing to achieve her purpose he would never have turned his back on her after he threatened her security. The conundrum here is that she is only different by degree than many typical everyday people who dodge thoughts of right and wrong when it suits their purposes. SPOILERS When her mother realized Rhoda had committed murder she told the girl to go ahead and burn the incriminating evidence. Her grandfather had let his daughter grow into adulthood without letting her know about her shocking roots. Her teacher perhaps the only one who really understood what was going on just asked the mother to move Rhoda out of the school rather than going to the authorities with her suspicions.Then there was the bigger conundrum of our own attitudes about children. Rhoda gave out exactly what she thought the adults wanted from her  and she did it very well. She was the unreal dream storybook Shirley Templelike nonsexual pretty little girl people love. When things heated up she bypassed the subject by turning on the little girl language the adults would eagerly eat up. Her selfishness was considered cute and natural. SPOILER Even at the end most of the adults in her life looked on her as that wonderful storybook little girl. We do that a lot in this world assessing one another by predetermined stereotypes. Had Rhoda been publicly exposed there would have been a clamor to analyze her behavior for the warnings we could look for in other children so this kind of thing can never happen again. Many normal innocent sweet pretty little girls would soon find themselves subjected to cruel psychological behavior mod preventive therapies. Sound familiar?Patty McCormack was phenomenal as Rhoda. You could see her reading adult faces for reactions to her words. You could watch the evolution of decision cross her face at key moments. Hers was never the face of sinister evil. But she portrayed real childhood and she portrayed determination and she portrayed hate and she portrayed jealousy anger and rage and she portrayed happiness and glee. Patty McCormack did not portray Rhoda as any onedimensional troubled child. There was a depth to her performance that was every bit equal that of any adult legend or not in any movie before or since.".

	schema:reviewBody "Once again I found myself watching this film on TCM despite the fact I have seen it numerous times. There are many issues mentioned by other commentatorsthat make this film hard to take given today's aesthetic. Yes it is stagy yes the acting is mannered yes the main idea of the film is no longer shocking. Despite all of this you simply can't help but watch.The performances are truly wonderful. Kelly McCormack Jones and Heckart are all exceptional and the fact they and others played this on the stage shines through. They work as a welloiled machine. Nancy Kelly is very overthetop in parts but this must be viewed in the context of the style of acting at the time. Further watch her performance multiple times and pay close attention and I think you will find her reactions are not so farfetched in the context of the story as she gradually realizes what her daughter is capable of. I used to think McCormack was too arch but on further viewings it is clear this is a well thought out performance and very effective one of the best children's performances I have seen.Beyond the acting the film places a question that is very relevant today  what drives children to commit unspeakable acts  in a very simplistic setting. The frame work forces the viewer to consider the basic question of why and more importantly how would you react if you came to understand your offspring were evil.Don't be afraid of the things that make this film outdated and stylized instead give it a try and you won't be able to resist watching it again and again.".

	onyx:emotionText "Once again I found myself watching this film on TCM despite the fact I have seen it numerous times. There are many issues mentioned by other commentatorsthat make this film hard to take given today's aesthetic. Yes it is stagy yes the acting is mannered yes the main idea of the film is no longer shocking. Despite all of this you simply can't help but watch.The performances are truly wonderful. Kelly McCormack Jones and Heckart are all exceptional and the fact they and others played this on the stage shines through. They work as a welloiled machine. Nancy Kelly is very overthetop in parts but this must be viewed in the context of the style of acting at the time. Further watch her performance multiple times and pay close attention and I think you will find her reactions are not so farfetched in the context of the story as she gradually realizes what her daughter is capable of.

McCormack's mother Nancy Kelly begins to suspect that her daughter may have played a part in it. This subject must have been exceptionally shocking back in 1956. It had to have been really hard to accept. I'm guessing this because the writers overexplain every detail down to the bone. It drags the film out interminably. McCormack is actually excellent. Yeah she overacts a little but compared to most child actors of the era she's very good. The only other performance in the film I really liked was Henry Jones who plays the Cajun maintenance man who is at first the only one smart enough to see that McCormack is evil. Everyone else in the film overacts so badly that the film often becomes hard to sit through. Of course based on a play the film is overly stagey it even ends with a curtain call. The final scene in the movie is also pretty unintentionally hilarious. The film was hugely popular in its time and was nominated for four Oscars three for acting. The McCormack nomination is understandable. Kelly's nomination is sort of embarrassing but Eileen Heckart who plays the constantly drunken mother of the murder victim is one of the truly unbelievable nominations in the history of the Academy.".

The juxtaposition is startling and freakish. Eileen Heckart is a drunken force to be reckoned with voicing everything it's forbidden to say in the fifties. She's like Grace Zabriskie going to pieces in Twin Peaks. It also revisits the main plot point of Great Expectations with the shuttling of a pivotal little girl away from low origins.It's also a very funny artifact of the era. Christine learns her kid is essentially Satan and her neighbor thinks the solution is more vitamins! I cannot have a conversation with my mother at her prime in this era without her pestering me about vitamins. I kept wanting the movie to be brave enough to kill this kid so the divine judgment at the end is a hoot.The idea that badness emerges genetically after skipping a generation like hemophilia is pretty goofy. More likely children are born with distinct temperaments.

The acting among the adult principals is pretty stagy as though they're trying to reach the balcony. While the otherwise excellent Henry Jones LeRoy camps it up as if he'll be otherwise overlooked. Little Rhoda McCormack certainly looks the part especially in that white froufrou. Plus she sounds appropriately heartless when her sweet Snow White turns into the Wicked Witch. On the whole however the movie doesn't wear well. It's too much like a stage play lengthy talky and static. No doubt the theme was daring for its time though the notion of a bad seed strikes me as not only dubious but pernicious as well. As a result I'm not sure whether to commend Warners or not.

	schema:reviewBody "For some reason I managed to miss the reviews for Jared Hess' Gentlemen Broncos when it first opened in limited release. I saw the trailer for it some time ago and was excited for it Napoleon Dynamite and even Hess' followup Nacho Libre were two of the most offkilter refreshing comedies I've seen in the past decade. Broncos is absolutely no exception expanding on and arguably perfecting the geekverse that Hess started with Napoleon. This third film in the Crayola Trilogy may be so well designed for scifi geeks and lovers of Hess' first two movies that it simply had no way to possibly survive in the mainstream market. Me? I loved it. Not seeing any reviews beforehand I was expecting a film that hit the same high notes of Napoleon and for me I got them. I am also a scifi nut and I like my comedies full of bizarre and strangely real people this Hess excels in as well. I went to bed last night rating it a 10 on IMDb I was shocked to see the rating at a mere 5.5 10. Flip over to Rotten Tomatoes it's a Rotten at 16. I also find it worth noting that neither of Hess' previous releases have been treated on IMDb much better I seem to remember a time when ND was in the Top 250 or at the very least had a much higher rating than it does today 6.9. I recall ND being hailed as a cult classic only to see its popularity seemingly cripple later opinions of the film regardless of the fact it started very small.Anyway. I'm just saying I think Jared Hess' work has been roundly ignored for being truly great cinema. I can see why Gentlemen Broncos has not enjoyed the success of ND it is a truly farout film that only nuts such as myself are likely to enjoy I spent my youth much like the lead character writing short stories and dreaming up faroff worlds for kids like that and their adult counterparts I can only say See This Film. You won't regret it.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I see a film like this receiving such an average rating on IMDb it really makes me wonder why certain people feel the need to rate a film that they must know is just not aimed at them. Just leave it alone and go rent some formulaic pseudoquirky comedy like the Hangover or something. But for those of you who believe humor is something that needs constant reinventing then look no further than Jared Hess' films. Gentlemen Broncos is quite simply one of the freshest funniest well acted from a comedic standpoint and sharply written comedies I've had the privilege of seeing.The film tells a small but endearing tale which is playfully examined on a number of skilfully interwoven levels. Like Hess's earlier film Napoleon Dynamite Broncos is populated by an array of quirky characters each with hidden depths. The setting is another small town in 'Nowheresville USA' and the context is the wonderfully brought to life world of trashy science fiction writing. Again as he did in ND Hess manages to create a world so utterly bizarre from a visual and aesthetic point of view but so familiar from an emotional point of view that the emotional tribulations of the characters become the dominant focus of the film. And this of course is the point. The emotions that the film both explores and manages to stir within the audience are the truest feature of the conceptual landscape. So as the film progresses the realness of the characters increasingly stands out against the more surreal elements of the film and with that the audience becomes increasingly enamoured of each and every one of them.The story itself centres on an insecure adolescent Benjamin Angarano who writes science fiction novellas. Hess succeeds wonderfully in giving us yet another central character who we immediately root for and admire despite and perhaps because of his obvious lack of typical mainstream lead character traits. Angarano is as usual excellent in the lead role in that he manages to play a shy character with little to say while simultaneously holding the viewers' attention throughout. The supporting roles are all manned ably with Coolidge White and Clement scoring particularly well. However as is the case with every film he stars in Sam Rockwell steals the show from his very first scene to the very end of the closing credits. Choosing yet another quirky secondary character Rockwell again shows that he's not just the most talented character actor of his generation but one of the most instinctively and originally funny as well. Being a good actor and being funny in a film are not necessarily mutually compatible skills but Rockwell does it with ease and as the fictional heroes of both Bronco and Brutus he gives us two entirely different and insanely original comedy SciFi characters that I will personally relish watching again and again.As a backdrop to the action Hess uses the world of pulp science fiction novels and as intimated above it is with this multilayered device that main thrust of the comedy is delivered. The fictional world of the Yeast Lords is so outrageously funny that I defy anyone to get through the four or five scenes starring Bronco or Brutus without cracking up at least once for those who have the DVD there's a particularly hilarious blooper where Rockwell can't bring himself to say the line were there pimps? without breaking into laughter at the sheer absurdity of his lines. All in all the film sends up this peculiar little genre of writing while clearly maintaining a strong affection for the potential imaginative freedom it sometimes manages to exploit.Gentlemen Broncos is the most original and authentically eccentric film I've seen well since Napoleon dynamite. This latter aspect to Hess' films is a true virtue given the plethora of 'whackybynumbers' films that Hollywood has been inflicting on us over the past decade. At no time watching Broncos did I feel like I'd seen any of it before and the freshness combined with the innate razorsharp wit of the writing and acting allowed me to laugh the most refreshing and honest laughs I had laughed in years. If you watched it and didn't like it but did like ND please go back and watch it again. This is a rare gem of a film and if you ultimately change your mind and come to agree with us small band of Hess devotees then do your best to get that ridiculously inappropriate rating up.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jared Hess and wifeproducer Jerusha are truly mad geniuses! Hess's third movie after Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre Gentlemen Broncos qualifies as insanely hilarious. The challenge of dramatizing the subject of plagiarism would be considerable for anybody but the Hess's have done an imaginative job of adapting it as an absurdist comedy of errors between two goofy scifi writers. Indeed this trim 90minute epic possesses an obvious high camp quality in its outlandish depiction of science fiction. Believe me the narrative in the crazy scifi scenes is abysmal so horribly bad that is emerges as funny. A popular scifi author of significant renown Ronald Chevalier Jemaine Clement of HBO's Flight of the Conchords has lost his touch. Chevalier's publisher threatens to stop publishing him. At the Cletus Writers Camp Chevalier plagiarizes a high school student's infantile but original manuscript that he got at a writers camp where he served as the chief spokesman. Gentlemen Broncos alternates the scenes of the conniving Chevalier touting his art and our high school protagonist Benjamin Michael Angarano of Empire State with their versions of Yeast Wars. These scenes are entertaining nonsense that resembles something out of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The scene when Chevalier tries to bribe Benjamin at a book signing convention is memorable. When Hess isn't pitting Chevalier against Benjamin he treats us to sensitive scenes of Benjamin and his deluded mother Judith Jennifer Coolidge of American Pie who has dreams of selling a line of women's night garments. A subplot involving a possible romance interest for Benjamin and a wacky filmmaker perhaps not unlike Hess is amusing too. Beware of the lowestcommon denominator bowel humor especially projectile vomiting. Gentleman Broncos is not for everybody.".

This film is so bad it's beyond fantastic! One can tell that people who worked on it had a lot of good times with it. Also being a graphic designer I fully appreciated simple yet awesome film titles.

At first viewing it did not seem like much. But that is the style of Jared and Jerusha Hess. One does not watch their movies once and love it. One watches their movies and finds something funny not noticed before every time. Then the love of their movie grows in the viewer's mind. And for Napoleon Dynamite the critics had to admit there was something more to it than a cheaply made movie.The Hess's style of writing does not focus on some crazy larger than life shot 'em up. They always focus on the boring and average people. They make us find what is great in most of us the commoners. I love them for that.To set the record straight Gentlemen Broncos was better written than Napoleon Dynamite. It had more of a plot and the characters were far more interesting. The topics covered were more far reaching. I won't spoil the movie but I will warn viewers against critics who allowed every Adam Sandler movie all Michael Myers movies American Pie movies and Meet the Spartans to make their way to theaters. Just because they left this one out doesn't mean that it was a bad movie. Give it a chance and you will see that this was a funny creative and heartwarming movie.PS the humor was not crude in my opinion. I think the PG13 rating was excessive.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie last night at a sneak preview in Jared Hess' home city. It totally ruled. It was full of laughoutloud scenes with comedy on every level excellent performances and a sneaky plot that Scorsese would have been proud of. Everyone in the audience seemed to love it lingering to cite scenes to each other long after the film was over. Even the press seemed genuinely giddy to be there.Everyone who follows comedy knows what a big hit Napoleon Dynamite was and although Nacho Libre was extremely funny it lacked some of the kitschy style that made Napoleon more than just a comedy. Gentlemen Broncos seems to be the calculated result of a wise decision to return to form. If Napoleon Dynamite has nerds Gentlemen Broncos has Supernerds if Napoleon Dynamite has touches of the 70's and 80's Gentlemen Broncos has dropped you off and left you there.Like the best Wes Anderson films Hess has the ability to identify and isolate a lovably weird segment of our society and walk right on that line for the duration of his films. In this case it's the souldrying bad scifi stories that I used to see when I was a kid but don't anymore. The lone lasergunwielding hero standing on a world with three moons and a tight litup grid pattern for ground the farming space station that's been overrun by cyborg apes the space worm etc. The kind of bad stories that couldn't even merit a hardback release let alone a movie and now can't even be found new. Capturing that odd energy and riffing a clear story on top of it earns Hess bonus points right off the bat.He also has a gift for making good actors great at being bad on purpose. Mike White has never been even nearly as hilarious as he was in this film watch out for snakes Jennifer Coolidge was in top form as usual and Sam Rockwell got all the way on board with a career burning phoenix of comedy that covered the polar ends of the spectrum. And because Hess pays special attention to each character Hector Jiminez and Halley Feiffer are given equal opportunity to steal the show and turn hilarious performances.Now let's start a new paragraph. Shame on whoever dissed this movie before I had a chance to get here you shall fall into the pit which you dig because you seem to have forgotten one important detail Jemaine Clement is in this movie. You can't give anything with Jemaine Clement in it one freakin' star. It's against the laws of physics. And when people see that you've done that they'll only question whether you really even saw this movie at all. One of the funniest people alive Jemaine Clement of Flight of the Conchords reproves his very real characteracting abilities swanning over the film in full form as a tightly wound badjeanswearing writerbearded egomaniac who is so cheesy that you can smell the leather conditioner coming out of the screen. He was the obvious heir to the throne for the whole show and turns in what I think is his best performance so far by far which is really far. He's a fullblown comedic genius and still seems to have been able to go even further under the direction of Jared Hess.But the real satisfaction ends up coming from Hess knowing to place Michael Angarano right up front to show everyone what he can do. Clement is no surprise when his greatness comes through that's just normal. But to watch Angarano hang ten on his own terms through his own scenes was magnificent.I caught Michael Angarano in several films starting with Seabiscuit. But it was in the family favorite Sky High that I noticed how well he was starting to do subtle comedy as a farce's underdog a'la Ben Stiller. Apparently Hess noticed him long before that and was able to capitalize on Angarano's rising talent to have it perfectly coincide with Gentlemen Broncos. He builds up the pain in Angarano's character so smoothly and steadily that when he finally explodes it's about as pressured as Travis the Taxi Driver. Except replace the mohawk with a woman's clownsuit dress and the gun with a bean pillow in the shape of a blonde mustached tranny. And throughout the windup Michael Angarano plays everything to a tee walking browfirst above bloodshot eyes seeming to be struggling to keep down his own intestines at the sight of the limitless tragedies that are happening to him throughout the bulk of the film. He's so likable and wellpaced that you just can't believe it either and can't imagine anything getting any better for him until he goes off in a blaze of glory.Now I realize that all of these descriptors may sound like Hess may have sacrificed the inspired randomness of Napoleon Dynamite in order to make a more structured film. But let me console you in saying that somehow surrounding this Coenworthy plot is so much perfect silliness that most people won't even see all of the true plot steps until they come together for a perfect showdown and a winning finale. In fact the movie is so wild that some will mistake it for trying relying on sophomoric humor which it sells fresh and hot throughout when the majority is more intelligent situational and quotable line humor with which Hess is a born natural. But analyze it honestly and you'll see that the emotionbased story is top rate in it's rawness and simplicity like all the best films.In short Gentlemen Broncos is just like it's name a sophisticated welldressed animal that kicks naysayers repeatedly in several places. I wish I had the connections to be able to see it again right now. Thank you comedy Gods for giving us Jared Hess.".

	schema:headline " Occasionally amusing quirky takeoff on the world of scifi fantasy writers";
	schema:reviewBody "Gentlemen Broncos is a quirky offbeat comedy from the same director who brought us 'Napolean Dynamite'. We first meet our protagonist 'Benjamin Purvis' with his ditsy mother Judith sending him off to a two day seminar for aspiring adolescent scifi fantasy writers entitled 'The Cletus Fest'. While on the bus going to the festival he befriends two attendees Lonnie a gay MexicanAmerican filmmaker responsible for a multitude of lowbudget films and his sidekick Tabatha an aspiring but hopelessly untalented screenwriter.Benjamin has written his own scifi fantasy opus entitled The Yeast Lords The Bronco Years. He hopes to get advice from Dr. Ronald Chevalier a once successful fantasy writer who now has writer's block and has been warned by his publisher to come up with something fresh. Chevalier reminds me of the character 'Roger De Bris' from the original Mel Brooks 1968 'Producers' moviea pretentious affected theater director Jermaine Clement is similarly a hoot as the crazy fantasy author.Chevalier is at the Cletus Fest because he needs the money and ends up teaching a workshop on how to create better character names for scifi fantasy novels when Benjamin tells Chevalier he's using 'Bronco' as his main character title Chevalier feels 'Broncanus' will work much better. Even more outrageous are Chevalier's original book cover illustrations for his 'Cyborg Harpie' series.Cheavlier is also one of the judges for a writing competition at the Cletus Fest. Benjamin hands his script in and Chevalier ends up stealing it simply changing the character names as he recommends during the earlier 'workshop'. Throughout the film we are treated to two different and equally outrageous film versions of Benjamin's novel. The first 'treatment' is the way Benjamin imagines it his hero 'Bronco' battles the 'Yeast Lords' who appear to be a bunch of Cyclops on a barren asteroid who have stolen Bronco's 'gonads'. After Lonnie offers Benjamin 500 with a postdated check one year from now Lonnie goes ahead and creates his own hack version of 'The Yeast Lords' casting himself along with Benjamin's 'Guardian Angel' who has a penchant for snakes that defecate the 'Angel' is hired at the behest of Benjamin's mother who feels her son is in need of more friends.Meanwhile Benjamin is trying to help his mother's fashion design business get off the ground. She hears that a wealthy investor Don Carlos might be interested in promoting her business but when she shows up at his mansion he cavalierly makes it known that if she expects to have him invest in the business she'll be required to have sex with him. After his advances are met with her screams the demented millionaire fires a gun at both Benjamin and his mother. They take off in their car and just escape being shot.Things go from bad to worse for Benjamin when Lonnie convinces him to star in Tabatha's new film. At the film's premiere Benjamin realizes that Lonnie has made him look like an idiot and that Tabatha's film is horrible he runs out of the theater and throws up. In an over the top scene Tabatha runs out of the theater too and expresses her love for Benjamin by kissing him even though his vomit still covers part of his face. Benjamin eventually discovers Cheavlier's plagiarized version of his book now entitled 'Brutus and Balzaak' on a display rack in a bookstore and later attacks the dastardly fantasy author at a book signing. All seems lost when Benjamin is arrested and thrown in jail. His Mom saves the day when she reveals that she's registered all of Benjamin's books with the Writer's Guild ever since he began writing. Now that Benjamin can prove he holds the copyright to his work all of Chevalier's books are destroyed and Benjamin becomes successful enough to finance his mother's first fashion show.On the plus side the film's creator Jared Hess has showed improvement in his screen writing abilities in that his current protagonist Benjamin is actually warm and likable as opposed to the unlikeable Napolean Dynamite. What's more Hess tells a story here that is not only imaginative but holds your interest from beginning to end. Jermaine Clement gives a strong satirical performance mocking the world of scifi fantasy writers and their misguided adolescent fans.On the down side those 'film versions' of the 'The Yeast Lords' get kind of repetitious and you could say that the joke wears thin. While Cheavlier and to a lesser extent Lonnie are amusing characters I found the two female principals Judith and Tabatha too clownish to be taken too seriously despite Judith coming through for Benjamin in the end. Hess seems conflicted as to his feelings toward women in generalwhile his portrayal of the two women can be viewed as an 'affectionate sendup' at the same time he ridicules them he wants us to laugh at both of them for their lack of talentin Judith's case it's her ridiculous fashion designs and in the case of Tabatha her incredible pretentiousness as a screenwriter.Gentlemen Broncos will not win any awards as the next Citizen Kane. But as an occasionally amusing offbeat satire of the little known world of scifi fantasy writing it's worth at least one look.".

Gentleman Broncos follows awkward scifi loving Benjamin as he tries to have his story Yeast Lords made into a movie. But after going to a scifi camp and meeting his favorite scifi author Chevalier played by Jemaine from Flight of the Concords he steals Benjamin's idea and makes the book himself.Now first things first unlike another That Was Junk writer I like Napoleon Dynamite and I don't think it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I love it in fact movies about awkward weird people out of place people make me smile. And that's what this movie felt like. It's basically Napoleon Dynamite 2. The main character Benjamin played by Micheal Angorano isn't necessarily as weird as Napoleon Dynamite but everyone else around him is such as his mother played by lovely Jennifer Coolidge who sells tacky clothing and giant balls of popcorn is.Everything and everyone is weird in this movie. And everyone is fitted in retroesque clothing and sporting bad haircuts. There is a lot of silly dialog and snappy oneliners that would make any teenager crackup. Watching at 5 in the morning had me laughing but honestly the lack of sleep could have been a factor. It's quite obvious Jared Hess has an odd and unique way of making movies. Even if one hates the dialog I don't think anyone could deny that he is a great director. And cinematographer Munn Powell also DP on Napoleon Dynamite has a way of making Hess' movies look dated. Hess loves awkward deformed and over the top character. Hctor Jimnez of Nacho Libre fame plays oversmiling and flamboyant Lonnie. Sam Rockwell plays the rough and tough Bronco and the flouncy Brutus. And Mike White plays the Jennifer Coolidge's slow husband. I loved all these characters because they were silly. I can most definitely guarantee that one of the big reasons this movie has a 5.4 on IMDb is because people hate the characters. They make you feel uncomfortable and have you asking why are they doing that? Their dialog movements and just everything about them is completely unnecessary. So why do I love them because everything about them is so unnecessary. It's like passing through a small town when you're coming from your big city home. Everything is surreal and you feel like you've stepped into another world. The Clothes are old fashion and the people are completely clueless. I love people and movies like that personally. I love movies that don't take their characters too seriously and can make them silly. It's the reason why I watch movies like GForce from time to time.If Napoleon Dynamite made you want to pull your eyeballs out then stay for from this movie you won't like it.

The main character Benjamin played by Micheal Angorano isn't necessarily as weird as Napoleon Dynamite but everyone else around him is such as his mother played by lovely Jennifer Coolidge who sells tacky clothing and giant balls of popcorn is.Everything and everyone is weird in this movie. And everyone is fitted in retroesque clothing and sporting bad haircuts. There is a lot of silly dialog and snappy oneliners that would make any teenager crackup. Watching at 5 in the morning had me laughing but honestly the lack of sleep could have been a factor. It's quite obvious Jared Hess has an odd and unique way of making movies. Even if one hates the dialog I don't think anyone could deny that he is a great director. And cinematographer Munn Powell also DP on Napoleon Dynamite has a way of making Hess' movies look dated. Hess loves awkward deformed and over the top character. Hctor Jimnez of Nacho Libre fame plays oversmiling and flamboyant Lonnie. Sam Rockwell plays the rough and tough Bronco and the flouncy Brutus. And Mike White plays the Jennifer Coolidge's slow husband. I loved all these characters because they were silly. I can most definitely guarantee that one of the big reasons this movie has a 5.4 on IMDb is because people hate the characters. They make you feel uncomfortable and have you asking why are they doing that? Their dialog movements and just everything about them is completely unnecessary. So why do I love them because everything about them is so unnecessary. It's like passing through a small town when you're coming from your big city home. Everything is surreal and you feel like you've stepped into another world. The Clothes are old fashion and the people are completely clueless. I love people and movies like that personally. I love movies that don't take their characters too seriously and can make them silly. It's the reason why I watch movies like GForce from time to time.If Napoleon Dynamite made you want to pull your eyeballs out then stay for from this movie you won't like it.

	schema:reviewBody "Gentlemen Broncos tells the story of Benjamin Michael Angarano a teenage homeschooled boy who aspires to become a published science fiction writer. He attends a writers camp where he meets Chevalier Clement Benjamin's favorite scifi writer. It is at this camp that Benjamin is given the opportunity to have his work finally published in a writer contest to be judged by Chevalier himself. Reluctant to have his work read at first Benjamin is convinced by others on the trip to do it.Meanwhile Chevalier is having trouble of his own. His latest work has been rejected by his publishers. He is on the brink of losing his publisher if he doesn't produce better material. Desperate to further his career Chevalier turns to one of the contest entries. After reading just a few pages of Benjamin's story he does the unthinkable and steals it and turns it into his own.Benjamin is unaware of the actions taken by his idol and after the camp he returns home to his mother Jennifer Coolidge who has signed up Benjamin in a sort of big brother program. Benjamin's guardian is Dusty Mike White a curly haired throwback to the 80s whose hobbies include snakes blow darts and checking out Benjamin's mother.I think I'm going to stop going into the later plot points of the film. Just a few quick notes Benjamin tries to get his book turned into a low budget movie by some of his writers camp buddies he tries to help out his mom a struggling a fashion designer and we see more of Chevalier and Benjamin going back and forth with the book after it is released. Oh and there are some reenactments from the book both from Benjamin's perspective and from Chevalier. Sam Rockwell plays the main character Bronco in both.This film just fell flat on its face in my opinion. There are several aspects that are just glaringly wrong. For instance the main character of Benjamin is so bland uninteresting and serves only one purpose of writing the story. He does virtually nothing through the entire film. He is shy introverted and just lets whatever happen. It is only when he finds out Chevalier has plagiarized his work that he shows some emotion. In both Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre the main character is quirky unique and entertaining. Here we do have a very interesting character in Chevalier but he plays a lesser character.Another flaw lies within the other secondary characters surrounding Benjamin. The two other teens that he hangs with are Tabatha and Lonnie. They are annoying mean and odd to the point of being uncomfortable. Lonnie's facial expressions are so bizarre unnecessary and plain hard to look at that I immediately disliked the character. Tabatha who looks more normal is unpleasant and has very little emotion and when she does it is very forced. These characters are so unlikable that is made me dislike Benjamin for putting up with them. It's okay for Chevalier to be mean because he is the villain if he can be called that. These two are just weird and not good for the film.The scenes from the science fiction story about Bronco start off strange but I didn't mind. Then things just go over the top and it's hard to stay focused. I thought they could have added so much more to the story but they didn't work for me. I love Sam Rockwell but these scenes were weak unorganized and too weird for my taste. I know the story is supposed to be weird but it was unnecessary.The story could be used for a much better film but the execution is horrendous. The writing is flat and isn't really funny. This movie is supposed to be a comedy. What we have here is a major flop. It doesn't succeed in the areas it needed to. What concerns me most is how much of a fall Hess has taken. His films are getting more and more out there. I am not opposed to strange cinema but it has to have a point. There is nothing learned here. Maybe that homeschooling produces strange kids science fiction writers are also strange and that the Midwest is well strange. Avoid this film if you can.".

Gentleman Broncos is a 90 minute march of superficial characters and endless sophomoric jokes that don't further the plot or serve any purpose. There is very little of merit in this film to hold on to. Much way way too much of the film is spent in the godawful storywithinastory fantasy world of Yeast Lords which is a barrage of sophomoric jokes and grossout humor. Attempting the whole it's so bad it's funny! thing but it's so over the top and charmless that it wears quickly and doesn't pull of the funny part. Snakes pooping on people and plots based on gonads being stolen is not an example of satirical comedic genius. It's the work of a lazy writer crossing their fingers hoping someone might laugh. I'll give this movie one star because it only had one Jemaine Clement was undoubedly the shining light of this film. Clement is undyingly charismatic on screen and turns even this weak script into something worth listening to. However with the serious and underlying issues that riddled the rest of this film there's no way Jemaine Clement could have saved the show on his own he's just what kept me from leaving the theater. The commenter below me compares this film to Wes Anderson Scorsese and the Coen Bros they must be a close personal friend of Jared Hess or a PR agent for Fox Searchlight or maybe we saw different movies. The film that I saw had very little in it to hold on to. As a whole Gentleman Broncos is charmless and unsatisfying. Avoid avoid avoid.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like a lot of folk I enjoyed Napoleon Dynamite. I found it funny charmingly quirky with a sense of heart. So I looked forward to Nacho Libre Hess' follow up which starred Jack Black as a priest moonlighting as a masked wrestler. From the guy that brought us Napoleon Dynamite how could he go wrong with that concept? Well if you saw Nacho Libre you know how he did. And it's the same with Gentlemen Broncos another good concept fledgling writer has his cheesy scifi novel stolen by a veteran writer that is totally fumbled by Hess. Methinks Napoleon worked more through the strength of the cast and Hess's own inexperience. But the more experienced he gets the worse his films get. GB doesn't have a bad cast all are talented performers but you might have to see them in other pictures to realize that. Hector Jimenez in particular is just too quirky for his own good. A lot of the characters are too the point that they're caricatures and it's hard to care about caricatures. Like Nacho Libre Hess likes parading unusual looking extras in front of the cameras but instead of us feeling for them it's like he's the barker at a freak show just pointing out Hey man lookit this one boy he's weiiiird! That sense of heart I enjoyed so much in Napoleon Dynamite is definitely missing. As a fan of those trashy scifi novels that made up the title sequence and obviously served as inspiration for this movie there are homages present in GB that I liked. Yeast Farms clone armies robostags not as unusual as you might think. Jemaine Clement and Sam Rockwell are both very funny in their roles but seeing as how Jemaine Clement IS the antagonist it's sort of a shame he isn't used more. There's a lot of stuff that should have been cut and in the hands of a better director a really cool concept wouldn't have gone to waste. Maybe someone can plagiarize it and realize the potential that Hess has wasted once again.".

Jared and Jerusha Hess are excellent writers and I love their quirky characters and the colorful worlds these characters live in.But this film just does NOT work! Any film that has gratuitous use of vomiting is destined for the trash heap and this film has so much of it that you are scratching your head about how on earth it was every approved for release. It makes sense it was pulled from the theaters after just a couple weeks.Here is a great example of the stuff that is so awful you can't even believe you're watching it Benjamin is in a movie theater an gets sick to his stomach seeing the trash on the screen that his book has become and goes to throw up in the lobby. Then Tabatha comes out into the lobby to profess her love for him and kisses him immediately after he vomits before he's had any chance to clean up or anything. DISGUSTING!!! Ronald Chevalier is hilarious. A completely arrogant buffoon that Jemaine Clement pulls off wonderfully. The bluetooth headset he always has on but never uses. The crazy Native American accents to all his outfits. Hilarious.".

	onyx:emotionText "I wanted SOO badly for this movie to succeed. I am a HUGE fan of Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre and will watch the films over and over again. Jared and Jerusha Hess are excellent writers and I love their quirky characters and the colorful worlds these characters live in.But this film just does NOT work! Any film that has gratuitous use of vomiting is destined for the trash heap and this film has so much of it that you are scratching your head about how on earth it was every approved for release. It makes sense it was pulled from the theaters after just a couple weeks.Here is a great example of the stuff that is so awful you can't even believe you're watching it Benjamin is in a movie theater an gets sick to his stomach seeing the trash on the screen that his book has become and goes to throw up in the lobby. Then Tabatha comes out into the lobby to profess her love for him and kisses him immediately after he vomits before he's had any chance to clean up or anything. DISGUSTING!!! Ronald Chevalier is hilarious. A completely arrogant buffoon that Jemaine Clement pulls off wonderfully. The bluetooth headset he always has on but never uses. The crazy Native American accents to all his outfits. Hilarious.";

Written and directed by Jared Hess also responsible for Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre this eccentric comedy lands somewhere in between the hypnotic success of the former and the disappointing shortfalls of the latter. The opening act is a real riot with quirky colorful characters stepping out of the wallpaper and amazing over thetop visualizations of Benjamin's work that treat his hokey material with unmasked deference.

That is what is so great about it! A movie that can actually show reality just like it is. A bunch of really awkward people behaving awkwardly showing over the top quirks and pretending to be someone they're not because who they are is just too depressing. Michael Angarano stars as Benjamin a kid from a small town in Utah who is an aspiring Science Fiction author. He has written a novella based on his father and well yeast. And flying cyborg deer with lasers and missiles. He attends a scifi aspiring author's convention where he meets his one of his heroes. Jemaine Clemens does an awesome job as the self centered extremely spacey science fiction writer Ronald Chevalier. On the trip he also meets some new friends. One a girl who quickly becomes infatuated with Benjamin and her friend who is a big time producer in his own garage studio. Intertwined into this story are live action scenes from Benjamin's prize novella Yeast Lords starring Sam Rockwell as Bronco who's gonads have been stolen from him for some reason I still don't quite understand. I won't give away much more of the movie. I'll just give you a list of a few of my favorite scenes.1 The hand massage on the bus NOBODY! needs that much lotion. 2 Chevalier giving his lecture on how to make better character names Broncanus 3 Chevalier revealing the never before seen 47 alternate book cover art from his original series The Cyborg Harpies especially the mammary cannons shooting laser rain 4 Chevalier revealing the never before heard lyrics to the Harpie Queen's lullaby 5 Movie trailer of the love story between Benjamin and the crazy girl Fatal Attraction anyone? 6 The vomit kiss... need I say more? 7 Benjamin's new guardian angel arrives with the pooping snake. 8 Ben's mother trying to cram his popcorn car through the jail bars. 9 The alternate ending Chavalier's version of Brutus and Balzaak. 10 The final battle scene of Yeast Lords!Finally I saved this one for last because it is my favorite part of the movie Ben fights back. Taking out the guy with the poop needle and punching Chevalier with the miniature souvenir pillow. It was nice to see the poor kid finally stand up for himself and those people important to him. Needless to say I highly recommend this film to anyone in the mood for a good lighthearted comedy with a fun story and likable characters. By the way I'll go ahead and throw this in because I was reminded of it by Lonnie's movies. There really are people out there that make movies that bad. Go here httpsutahwolfproductions.com. I personally recommend starting out with She Hulk. As for Gentleman Broncos I give a 10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Beautiful MindDirector Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience's heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13 when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? Ok so if you remember your recent history you knew.... but still! Or remember in Parenthood when Steve Martin's kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. And you know he'll never stop being called Opie even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run. And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all not when you can do it in such a sincere noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional rarely looking anyone in the eye but pours all of his energy  and soul  into producing one original idea an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.But John like most who have had movies made about them had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia Jennifer Connelly and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease folks  it's still not fully understood and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium as doctors struggle to find a cure.Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says Russell Crowe you'll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all he's playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role and he's unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors this is the kiss of death because then they're exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe if anything this proves once and for all that he's a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him but I think that when actors are labeled as a hunk  their skills as actors aren't seen as very substantial. Hey looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.And he ages well too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time ending with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy he looks completely genuine. And that's the essence of Crowe's performance. It's sincere never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise elegance and is utterly astounding in the role.His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be in most roles she's the eye candy. But this role had meat to it and she held her own. It wasn't an easy role to play and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies that one moment that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.And yes this does have some very very touching moments. The final scene while predictable even if you don't know the outcome in real life will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes I'll admit it it got me right here. But it's okay I did that old 'guycryinginmovietheater' trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly but at least they won't think you're a girly man.At any rate it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything's in place the direction the photography and especially the acting.".

But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease folks  it's still not fully understood and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium as doctors struggle to find a cure.Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says Russell Crowe you'll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all he's playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role and he's unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors this is the kiss of death because then they're exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe if anything this proves once and for all that he's a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him but I think that when actors are labeled as a hunk  their skills as actors aren't seen as very substantial. Hey looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.And he ages well too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time ending with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy he looks completely genuine. And that's the essence of Crowe's performance. It's sincere never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise elegance and is utterly astounding in the role.His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be in most roles she's the eye candy. But this role had meat to it and she held her own. It wasn't an easy role to play and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies that one moment that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.And yes this does have some very very touching moments. The final scene while predictable even if you don't know the outcome in real life will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes I'll admit it it got me right here. But it's okay I did that old 'guycryinginmovietheater' trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly but at least they won't think you're a girly man.At any rate it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything's in place the direction the photography and especially the acting.";

	schema:reviewBody "A BEAUTIFUL MIND 2001 Rating 1010A Beautiful Mind's greatest achievement in my humble opinion is the way it makes schizophrenia accessible to sane people. The general public knows schizophrenics tend to talk to themselves repeat certain actions and do things generally at odds with the norm. But why? It's nearly impossible for a sane individual to understand why this happens...and more importantly what that feels like. Without this essential empathy many people become frustrated with the mentally ill asking why patients can't pull themselves together and just bear up. We express this same impatience with the criminally insane who act upon delusions with disastrous results. It is incomprehensible.A Beautiful Mind does all it can to change that and it succeeds. Unless you are familiar with John Nash's story you probably won't guess he's schizophrenic until partway into the movie. He's eccentric abrupt and highly intelligent but doesn't seem crazy. His delusions are as real as reality to Nash and likewise they are real to the audience who cannot tell the difference between truth and delusion.Incidentally I came across a review from a professional critic who blasted A Beautiful Mind for including all that spying stuff that had nothing to do with Nash's work that was thrown in for Hollywood thrill. I feel bad for that chap since he missed the entire point of the film. But that just proves Ron Howard's genius in creating a picture of insanity indistinguishable from reality.There are some truly shocking moments in A Beautiful Mind. When Alicia finds her husband's secret cache of newspaper clippings behind their house I was eerily reminded of Jack Nicholson's wife in The Shining discovering his endless typewritten pages of the same phrase. The scene that follows culminating with Nash's realization that his delusions are indeed a false reality is brilliant. In a moment remembering Marcee Nash has a flash of insight and he finally accepts his illness  ironically through his intellect. When Nash imagines that someone is going to harm Alicia he lunges at her  and only through his eyes do we see how a seemingly senseless act of violence is a gesture of love filtered through the smog of delusion.Now my take on the acting Superb in every sense of the word. Russell Crowe is incredible. I can't stress that enough. There's never any question about the authenticity of his character. Crowe doesn't rely on his elaborate makeup to age Nash  his walk words and voice do that elegantly in the movie's end. Crowe will get at least another Oscar nomination out of this one. And he better win. Jennifer Connelly is amazing as well. And when Crowe and Connelly are put together extraordinary chemistry erupts they just gel together they really belong with one another. Some people have had problems with the romance part of the movie saying that the way John and Alicia even started seeing each other wasn't very realistic and why Alicia would stay with John after he becomes distant. But I think that maybe it started out as just a crush you know and the math question she showed him was just her excuse for going to his office and she already knew she was going to ask him out before hand. Maybe she's just attracted to the kind of person Nash is? Who knows? A lot of people are attracted to the weirdest things sometimes. The crush took over the fact that he sort of insulted her work and she still asked him anyway. When you're around someone you like so much you can't help but be fooled by them. I can't really explain it but I can understand why she still asked him to dinner. And I guess if you love someone as much as Alicia loved John then you would stick with them through anything. Even how distant he became she still stuck with him.Moving on I think Ed Harris is as always great. Harris continues to prove that simply because he's flawless. With delusions like these no wonder Nash was torn between treatment and spying.Simply put A Beautiful Mind is a film which extends far beyond the 2 hours and 15 minutes that you will spend viewing it in the theater. The characters continued to haunt me after the movie and still do thanks to the Oscarinducing performances by Russell Crowe Jennifer Connelly and all of the supporting players. They are not merely acting yet are transformed into the characters leaving no trace of a line between their part and reality.Of course a film is only as good as a screenplay would allow and the story contained within is written in a way that compliments everything that is truly great about A Beautiful Mind. Ron Howard contributes truly inspiring work to this film and I hope that the critics remember him when awards are being given out.All I can tell you now is that if you're looking for an emotionallycharged movie that will make you cry but still filters in some very funny moments as to lighten things up every now and then with near perfect acting cinematography directing editing and a screenplay which will cause the story of John Nash to inspire you then consider A Beautiful Mind.I hope a lot of people see this film. Not just because Russell Crowe is a hunk or because it's a Ron Howard piece but because you will learn something important. You will learn why compassion is an absolute must when dealing with the mentally ill. You won't glare at the next person you see muttering to themselves. And when someone you love is dealing with a disorder be it schizophrenia or depression you won't ask them to pull themselves together. You will understand why they need your love  because they are just as confused as you are.In closing if Russell Crowe isn't awarded the Best Actor Oscar this year then my faith in movies and its rewards system will be seriously tarnished.".

Its uniqueness ironically enough because it was based on a real life situation was a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood blockbuster. This movie provided a brilliant pardon the pun insight into many aspects of a genius at work. This movie touched me on many levels. The psychology of the movie was intriguing the mathematical philosophies was actually realistic from my own experience and the icing on the cake making the movie stand out was surprisingly the humanistic side of Love. While love is a common basis in most movies the interaction of this theme with other aspects of the plot was planned phenomenlly. As for the cast I have never noticed the actual difference in skill between many actorsactresses before. I like Mel Gibson Tom Cruise etc but I wouldn't be able to pinpoint a classic actor's performance. But Russell Crowe in this film showed me what it was like to act in a way where I was in awe of his skill in playing this character especially when considering the extreme difference from characters in his other movies such as the Gladiator and The Insider. Russell Crowe was one of the big reasons this movie was so brilliant. Added to that the stellar performances of Jennifer Connelly Ed Harris and Adam Goldberg and this made for the 'perfect' movie. A Beautiful Mind was by far the most original intelligent and entertaining movie I have ever seen. And this from a movie I didn't expect big things from. Kudos to Ron Howard the cast and the crew of this movie. It was truly worthy of the Oscar and Russell Crowe was definately the most deserving of this production team to miss out on the highest accolade.

This is another of those Ron Howard basedonatruestory films so don't take everything here as gospel truth....because it ain't so. One example in real life Nash's wife was anything but as supportive as Jennifer Connelly was portrayed here.The first time I saw this film I was disappointed. Maybe I expected more maybe I felt the story was unfair to the viewer and I felt like this was just one more attempt at Liberal Hollywood to make fun of those in the 1950s who were opposed to Communism. Well on the second viewing just a few weeks ago I didn't have a problem with any of those things just enjoying the performances and the classylooking cinematography thanks to one of the best cameramen in the business Roger Deakins. I'm not always a fan of director Ron Howard but his films are usually interesting and pleasing to the eye. He and Crowe seem to be a good pair too as witnessed by 2005's Cinderella Man.For those who enjoy a cerebral thriller this is a very intriguing film. Ed Harris Paul Bettany Adam Goldberg Judd Hirsch Josh Lucas and Anthony Rapp all deliver solid supporting help and if you haven't seen this this story will deliver a big surprise. If you know the ending a second viewing is even more interesting as you trace Nash's actions from the beginning.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't actually planning on going to see A Beautiful Mind in the first place but as it was I was convinced by the friend that accompanied me that it was truly something to see. And now after seeing it I thank her for that. Instead of spending two and a half hours watching George Clooney and Matt Damon rob casinos or Kevin Spacey and Julianne Moore dealing with their problems in New Foundland I found myself pulled into another kind of story a powerful emotional story of how one man learned to battle his own demons and dazzle the world.A Beautiful Mind based on the novel by Sylvia Nasar is the story of John Forbes Nash Jr. the genius mathematician whose life suddenly takes a turn for the worse when he is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. After fierce battles with his inner self he overcomes this and returns to win the Nobel Prize in 1994 for his brakethrough game theory in economics that he had been working on during his years in Princeton University in the 1950s.John Nash portrayed very well by the versatile and brilliant Russell Crowe is a partly shy yet ironic and sometimes even arrogant gifted young student studying in Princeton University in the late 1940s. He dedicates his time to numbers and equations set on to solving every problem at hand rather than mingling with costudents on the football field or in the pub.Nash is later on introduced to Sylvia played by the lovely Jennifer Connely a physics student attending his classes. She helps Nash to open up and eventually discover love.Enter William Parcher played by Ed Harris a shadowy and mysterious agent working for the Department of Defense. Parcher after realizing Nash's ability to see mathematical and geometrical patterns everywhere approaches Nash with a mission that involves national security.Now amidst his work and relationship Nash is suddenly thrown into a whirlwind of emotions and disbeliefs as he is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. And this is the part where A Beautiful Mind truly shines in portraying the disorder from Nash's own point of view. In a powerful and emotional way it shows the viewer how difficult an illness like this can be to not only face but overcome something that people today may not always realize.Before seeing this movie I must admit that I was a bit afraid that casting such a wellknown actor as Russell Crowe as the main character would ruin the image of John Nash forcing the viewer to see Crowe rather than Nash. This is a common problem when dealing with famous actors but to my surprise it didn't much bother me much. And the same goes for Ed Harris.As a movie A Beautiful Mind is absolutely great It is so much more but I cannot find the words to praise it enough so I will simply go with great . Not only does it have a strong point and an importaint message to the viewer but it delivers it in a touching and sensitive partly even humourous kind of way with the help of powerful actors a great screenplay and even a few special effects to boost it up. So for anyone whose grown tired of the consant pointless actionmovies out there and instead want to immerse themselves into a characterdriven story that might actually bring a tear to your eyes I sincerily recommend A Beautiful Mind.".

	onyx:emotionText "I wasn't actually planning on going to see A Beautiful Mind in the first place but as it was I was convinced by the friend that accompanied me that it was truly something to see. And now after seeing it I thank her for that. Instead of spending two and a half hours watching George Clooney and Matt Damon rob casinos or Kevin Spacey and Julianne Moore dealing with their problems in New Foundland I found myself pulled into another kind of story a powerful emotional story of how one man learned to battle his own demons and dazzle the world.A Beautiful Mind based on the novel by Sylvia Nasar is the story of John Forbes Nash Jr. the genius mathematician whose life suddenly takes a turn for the worse when he is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. After fierce battles with his inner self he overcomes this and returns to win the Nobel Prize in 1994 for his brakethrough game theory in economics that he had been working on during his years in Princeton University in the 1950s.John Nash portrayed very well by the versatile and brilliant Russell Crowe is a partly shy yet ironic and sometimes even arrogant gifted young student studying in Princeton University in the late 1940s. He dedicates his time to numbers and equations set on to solving every problem at hand rather than mingling with costudents on the football field or in the pub.Nash is later on introduced to Sylvia played by the lovely Jennifer Connely a physics student attending his classes. She helps Nash to open up and eventually discover love.Enter William Parcher played by Ed Harris a shadowy and mysterious agent working for the Department of Defense. Parcher after realizing Nash's ability to see mathematical and geometrical patterns everywhere approaches Nash with a mission that involves national security.Now amidst his work and relationship Nash is suddenly thrown into a whirlwind of emotions and disbeliefs as he is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. And this is the part where A Beautiful Mind truly shines in portraying the disorder from Nash's own point of view.

	schema:reviewBody "The story of John Forbes Nash doesn't seem like the subject matter anyone would want to make a film of but Ron Howard brings forth his lifestory in a way that makes one forget he was also the man behind 80s fluff such as SPLASH and WILLOW.A life destined to excel once he discovers and cracks his game theory John Forbes Nash is however a man disconnected with his surroundings and reality. He can't even approach a girl without fumbling his way through an especially creepy introduction and at the same time he can't stand losing a simple mindgame with his friend. At the same time four other people make their appearances in Nash's life and all three are destined to change his life forever.The first of them is a college friend Charlie Paul Bettany of GANGSTER NO. 1 who later introduces Nash to his young daughter Marcee Alicia Jennifer Connelly whom he marries and a sinister figure William Parcher Ed Harris. Parcher has special designs for Nash he wants him to use his keen codecracking skills for special topsecret assignments involving the Russians and other obscure elements and on one night Nash gets to see just how dangerous the enemy is as he and Parcher are shot at after Nash delivers some information to a strange mansion posing as an intelligence office.It's not long before Nash becomes consumed with finding the perfect code and aided by the omnipresent Parcher who supplies Nash with a security code embedded into his own skin he dives headlong into a nightmare of numbers and codes and soon enough collapses into fullfledged schizophrenia which will require shock treatment and an arduous recovery period. Alicia instead of moving on forcefully stays by his side even when he has a dangerous regression and almost kills their baby child.Stories like this require a tight script and thorough knowledge of the circumstance of mental illness as well as the person in question in this case Nash. Howard directs Nash's progressive descent into his mental breakdown with ease and in a way where we're not sure if anyone who surrounded Nash is real  the way he introduces Charlie Marcee and especially Parcher and the covert office is spectacular and shows just how strong schizophrenia can be in inducing its victims to completely believe what they are seeing and hearing.And then there are the performances. I don't think I need to say anything which hasn't been said of Russell Crowe. He is right now the only living actor who has the guts and balls to put his masculinity aside and dive headfirst into the roles he plays. His screen presence oozes a magnetic masculine power and in one scene it's clear the man is built but that doesn't overcome his characterization of Nash. If anything he uses his physicality as an asset to clumsily walk around and there is one scene later in the movie when he has returned to teach classes. He walks with the shuffle of someone who's lost in his own world. It would be hardpressed for anyone to see the staccato waddle and the glazed eyes that he wouldn't be talking to himself in fullfledged conversations and the hippie who mocks him unnoticed expresses Anyone's reaction. We know this is a genius but one who has become damaged goods.Then there's Jennifer Connelly. An actress who as of yet has avoided selling out to blatant commercialism her presence is as powerful as Crowe's. Quiet but intense she is the foundation of which Crowe's feet rest on and without her he might as well be dead. Just one scene when she is about to discover just how crazy her husband is and his colleagues are trying to stop her just watch her reel around and casually but with authority slap one of them squarely in the face and continue on undeterred. Marvelous acting. Her Oscar is justified.The entire supporting cast is uniformly brilliant. Ed Harris nails his creepy role as the imaginary Parcher. Paul Bettany gives off friendly dependency  the friend who won't go away even though he too isn't real. Judd Hirsch Adam Goldberg and Christopher Plummer provide solid support in small roles.A complex movie about mental illness as well as the power of love and the triumph of the soul even if love  the devotion between Alicia and John  is excruciatingly strained at times A BEAUTIFUL MIND is truly a beautiful experience and justly won the Oscar for Best Movie and Director and should have also won Best Actor but Russell Crowe will stick around for quite some time giving powerhouse performances. He is one strong actor to follow. I know I will.".

	schema:headline " Schizophrenia is ragged and dirty";
	schema:reviewBody "... and in no way as clean logical and understandable as in pictured in that pathetic sum of tired Hollywood cliches.I'm 27 and I've spent 16 years of my life struggling through delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations. Like the main character in the film I was successful mainly because of logic  because I kept thinking over and over to keep delusion away from reality and to know what was really going on and what wasn't. In the end I was really successful because of medication by the way but I certainly escaped madness because I knew before I took medication the difference between what was real and what wasn't.So I feel entitled to tell you that this movie is a total fraud. Not only does it cheat with the main character's story who wasn't faithful to his wife who was bisexual  something really important here but mostly it shows a comforting tamed view of schizophrenia  which is entirely missing the point.Schizophrenia is a mind structure not a disease. A schizophrenic isn't a normal man with a disease it's someone who from early on views and feels things differently from most people  for him things like time space and people's personalities aren't solid things. He feels it can be bent it can change it can mutate and maybe even disappear. To cope with this a schizophrenic has a rich very imaginative inner world which normal people don't expect  but he's trapped in it because he can't relate with most people and his world gets poorer and poorer until he finishes in a blank delusive dead end.This is very different to what's depicted in this ridiculous cure tearjerking movie. It should be violently frightening. People other than the main character should appear strange weird and absurd like in Lynch's Eraserhead for example. There should be really impressive weird gross hallucinations because that's what schizophrenia is all about. It's not about details.I mean watch Naked Lunch Lost Highway read P.K. Dick's Martian TimeSplit or Ubik DO watch The Cell Perfect Blue Dark City or play American McGee's Alice on PC and you may have a vague idea of what it's like. Don't watch the feel good movie of the month with banal situations cleaned characters and visuals and stupid plot tricks. The Cell is the most accurate movie about a schizophrenic's mind his visions and his inner consistency  it's violent weird confusing and very very scary.Once again Schizophrenia isn't about details it's not a neat tame trick played to you. It jumps in your face and won't let you go  walls fall apart people turn into strange hostile creatures you feel like you go backward in time you're not sure you're who you think you are everything feels... strange unnatural. Believe me this is much much more than what's depicted in this soaplike melodrama".

	onyx:emotionText "... and in no way as clean logical and understandable as in pictured in that pathetic sum of tired Hollywood cliches.I'm 27 and I've spent 16 years of my life struggling through delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations. Like the main character in the film I was successful mainly because of logic  because I kept thinking over and over to keep delusion away from reality and to know what was really going on and what wasn't. In the end I was really successful because of medication by the way but I certainly escaped madness because I knew before I took medication the difference between what was real and what wasn't.So I feel entitled to tell you that this movie is a total fraud. Not only does it cheat with the main character's story who wasn't faithful to his wife who was bisexual  something really important here but mostly it shows a comforting tamed view of schizophrenia  which is entirely missing the point.Schizophrenia is a mind structure not a disease. A schizophrenic isn't a normal man with a disease it's someone who from early on views and feels things differently from most people  for him things like time space and people's personalities aren't solid things. He feels it can be bent it can change it can mutate and maybe even disappear. To cope with this a schizophrenic has a rich very imaginative inner world which normal people don't expect  but he's trapped in it because he can't relate with most people and his world gets poorer and poorer until he finishes in a blank delusive dead end.This is very different to what's depicted in this ridiculous cure tearjerking movie. It should be violently frightening. People other than the main character should appear strange weird and absurd like in Lynch's Eraserhead for example. There should be really impressive weird gross hallucinations because that's what schizophrenia is all about. It's not about details.I mean watch Naked Lunch Lost Highway read P.K. Dick's Martian TimeSplit or Ubik DO watch The Cell Perfect Blue Dark City or play American McGee's Alice on PC and you may have a vague idea of what it's like. Don't watch the feel good movie of the month with banal situations cleaned characters and visuals and stupid plot tricks. The Cell is the most accurate movie about a schizophrenic's mind his visions and his inner consistency  it's violent weird confusing and very very scary.Once again Schizophrenia isn't about details it's not a neat tame trick played to you.

A Beautiful Mind is one such picture that divides opinions although exemplary made and well put together it doesn't adhere quite to the facts of Nash's lifeit's an interpretation that smooths out the drama by way of delivering a safe and watchable biography.

Yet as great as that roll call is the big surprise is the omission of a win for Russell Crowe in the Best Actor category. For as tidy and engrossing as the film is and it is folks it's because of the big Kiwi that the film breaks free of your standard emotional heart tugger. It's a superlative performance from Crowe and him not winning is probably more to do with his much publicised dust up at the BAFTAS a few weeks before the Oscar ceremony than his undoubted acting ability.The film as a whole should not be viewed as a representation of John Nash's life many important things from Sylvia Nash's book have been omitted. But crucially it's important to note that in making this film the makers have brought Nobel Prize winner Nash to the public's attention whilst simultaneously giving awareness to the sadness of those suffering with schizophrenia. OK so it's far from perfect in its portrayal of Nash the man but ultimately the cinematic world is a far better place when the likes of A Beautiful Mind are being made and the film lovers are flocking to see it.

The production has a look that tells us we are seeing the events in the life of this crazy mathematician as it really happened. Nothing seems to be out of place here with the right touch of atmospheric detail in showing the past when Mr. Nash went from being an up and coming star in Princeton to his being selected for the Nobel prize in 1994 with enough time going into the schizophrenia that almost ruined his academic life as well as his own marriage.Russell Crowe plays this tormented soul with utter understanding of the man he is portraying. At no time does he strike a false note or gets too carried away with his own acting. That shows a firm hand by Mr. Howard whose command seems to be behind every shot of this film. Ed Harris is one of the best actors around and let no one tell you otherwise. He expresses so much with the simplest gestures any actor can make. His kind of acting is seamless from film to film. Here he gives a great and understated performance as the man in John Nash's nightmares and makebelieve world.The biggest surprise though is Jennifer Connelly. She demonstrates here as well as in previous work mainly her previous work in Requiem of a Dream that she is in a league of her own.

But this film misses the opportunity of a lifetime to merge the images of math and film.There are three good opportunities here all missedThe Nash Story Part 1 Mathematics is a matter of invention more than discovery.

The unfamiliar made familiar which can be done through proofs' which is a way of presenting the new in such a way that everyone believes the world was made that way all along.Which means you have to be extraordinarily clever in approaching a problem from an odd angle and finding the linkage. Nash was the best mind of the century in this first challenging both Einstein and Von Neumann!. That's saying a whole lot. It means you have to have an intense focus that you maintain uninterrupted for months. The very idea exhausts. Nash had this in spades perhaps his most remarkable quality because it was something he taught himself to do. Finally mathematics is a verbal art constructed in narratives with colleagues not intrinsically in funny symbols as cartoons and movies would have it.So think of this you must talk with peers using a common vocabulary but you must not in order to stay important and novel. You must shape the new in small terms but have a global focus holding mental orgasms for months. The tension between reaching far into the cosmos and keeping it in a conversation must have been immense. The book on which this film is based focuses on the social devolution of Nash but the more interesting side is where his unanchored voyages took him. The film didn't mine this lode. In reality Nash was not incompetent with soliciting sex in fact he was very smooth and conducted multiple simultaneous bisexual affairs. That was part of the focused exercise to relate to the world asis.' Where he was incompetent was in mapping his visions to our lesser reality.The Nash Story 2 Nash's madness was almost certainly caused by his breaking' his mind by straying too far from reality to get outside this large problem he was working. The conspiracies came not from cold war silliness but something far deeper Phil Dick science fiction and Kabbalah. Not stupid numbers but topologies forms. Not codes but manifold patterns in higher spaces. Literally extraterrestrial voices. By the way Alicia was as crazy but I suppose since she had an uninteresting mind it is not worth watching.The most powerful scene in the book at least is when Nash and poet Robert Lowell were in the same hospital.' Lowell entered Nash's room and mind daily and held forth on both for visitors. Every word was his best friend.' Quite possibly the century's most imaginative and literate minds melded. I would have loved to have been there. In fact I was in a thin way. I took the class Nash taught right after he was first committed  his acolyte emulated his manner.The Nash Story 3 is the story about the Nobel. Uncle Alfie didn't like mathematicians read Jews' so refused to establish a prize in math. The economics' was an independent prize grafted onto the Nobels as an almost' Nobel. Most scientists are uncomfortable with economics being treated like physics because it is more obviously a constructed reality. Nash's prize prompted a debate within the Nobel community that destroyed the economics prize and is eating away at whether there is anything left but math when you skim more than superficially. It is one of the most profound institutional selfexaminations ever. The film didn't mine this lode either.All missed opportunities. Wouldn't you like to have been transported rather than merely made to cry?What we get instead is a powerful actor and a competent director. Crowe's trick is to project his character not only into the space around him but into the space of the following scene  largely by physical motion usually involving the forehead. Good. But the mannerisms are not those of a mathematician in the Wiener tradition. The accent is not accurate just an excuse to give new rhythms to the bland lines. The effect of the madness is not true reflecting prior movies more than reality.Howard's directing is completely without risk art interest. The one effect he tries is a bunch of fiddling with glass shots through windows often with irrelevant mathematical doodles. These are amateurish because the film has no inner cosmology within which one can register the metaphor. Compare this with the use of glass in Spy Game.' MIT has a specific abstract feel that is very easy to capture but it somehow eluded the location scout.See it. Enjoy it. But weep for the lesser mortals' who fabricated it and mind the opportunities they missed.".

	schema:headline " Beautifully done";
	schema:reviewBody "Now this is the Russell Crowe I know and love.  The Insider L.A. Confidential... and now chalk up another calculating masterful performance.A Beautiful Mind tells the autobiographical story of John Forbes Nash Jr. a distinguished professor from Princeton who went on to make some great theories and win the nobel prize.  The centerpiece of the story is the fact that John Nash suffers from schizophrenia a debilitating condition for most people which leaves them helpless.  Thus it is amazing that Nash has been able to achieve what he has.  For the most part of the story his hallucinations turn out to institutionalize him at one point when he thinks the Russians are trying to secretly send him coded messages through news publications.First off the main performance by Crowe as Nash is amazing.  This is the performance that I know he is capable of complicated passionate and serious none of this gutteral one line BS that he uttered in Gladiator. Here we have a marvelous performance that Crowe spins as we watch Nash fall into despair every twitch eyes darting and Nash's helplessness this is not an easy task for any actor.  Nash is a recluse almost an autistic savant we see how he trys out his theories by writing on glass windows and stuffing himself in a corner of the library.  He is seriously gifted but a social misfit.  Early on we hear how Nash describes how a grade school teacher mentioned that he was born with 2 heapings of brain but only 12 of heart.Ron Howard's direction is great in exposing Nash's life.  Probably the best scenes involve the use of how Nash comes up with his theories such as why the dynamics of a colleagues tie is so bad or how a plan to get all of his college buddies laid leads to a theory that makes him famous.Also what else can I say about Jeniffer Connely who plays his wife in the film.  She is passionate and gives a full perfect 10 performance as well as the wife who is trying to survive with a husband she can't help.  But the greatest achievement of this film is how it portrays mental illness from the perspective of the person suffering it.Most films that deal with someone with a mental condition always place the focus on the people who are outside the person suffering watching from a distance trying to understand.  Here we have a film that literaly puts us in the mind of the sufferer as to what it is to live with such a debilitating illness.  We get Nash's sense of accomplishment but also his demons and paranoia.  And probably the most important thing is that we understand that mental illness isn't something that gets cured the people have to live with it and it never goes away.Also Crowe and Connely age in this film wonderfuly so many films try to age actorsactresses in makeup and it doesn't work but here it is done flawlessly..Minor faults in the film deal with that some of the supporting characters are reduced to props and people we don't know and at one point the film bogs slightly when Nash is trying to return to Princeton to study.  But these points are minor since the performances of the main characters are so well done and the stories focus is on them to begin with.Crowe will probably get the best actor for this.  Great film.Rating 8 out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "Now this is the Russell Crowe I know and love.  The Insider L.A. Confidential... and now chalk up another calculating masterful performance.A Beautiful Mind tells the autobiographical story of John Forbes Nash Jr. a distinguished professor from Princeton who went on to make some great theories and win the nobel prize.  The centerpiece of the story is the fact that John Nash suffers from schizophrenia a debilitating condition for most people which leaves them helpless.  Thus it is amazing that Nash has been able to achieve what he has.  For the most part of the story his hallucinations turn out to institutionalize him at one point when he thinks the Russians are trying to secretly send him coded messages through news publications.First off the main performance by Crowe as Nash is amazing.  This is the performance that I know he is capable of complicated passionate and serious none of this gutteral one line BS that he uttered in Gladiator. Here we have a marvelous performance that Crowe spins as we watch Nash fall into despair every twitch eyes darting and Nash's helplessness this is not an easy task for any actor.  Nash is a recluse almost an autistic savant we see how he trys out his theories by writing on glass windows and stuffing himself in a corner of the library.  He is seriously gifted but a social misfit.  Early on we hear how Nash describes how a grade school teacher mentioned that he was born with 2 heapings of brain but only 12 of heart.Ron Howard's direction is great in exposing Nash's life.  Probably the best scenes involve the use of how Nash comes up with his theories such as why the dynamics of a colleagues tie is so bad or how a plan to get all of his college buddies laid leads to a theory that makes him famous.Also what else can I say about Jeniffer Connely who plays his wife in the film.  She is passionate and gives a full perfect 10 performance as well as the wife who is trying to survive with a husband she can't help.  But the greatest achievement of this film is how it portrays mental illness from the perspective of the person suffering it.Most films that deal with someone with a mental condition always place the focus on the people who are outside the person suffering watching from a distance trying to understand.

The movie's direction is manipulative and the screenplay is horrid.  I thought this was suppose to be based on the true life of John Nash.  Didn't his wife divorce him in real life? Yes she did.  Wasn't Nash a homosexual? Nash says no but. Yeah right Mr. Nash.  Let's not use truths here let's just make up some stuff that an audience will like.  Well Hollywood I might have liked the movie more if his wife had divorced him or if there was a homosexual tinge to the film.  I needed to feel for the character and all this character was is a jerk.  Hell he says it himself I have a chip on both shoulders.  The movie makes him come off as a womanizing jerk.  How can I care about him. Well because Hollywood says we should feel for him and the media says it is a great film.  That's why we like it.  Give me a break.  I know this day will never come but I sure wish it would when will people learn to make there own decisions about movies music and tv shows etc. instead of allowing themselves to be conned into liking something just because the media says it is good.  And don't get me started on the Academy Awards because all that is now is a popularity contest.  The best films or actors or screenplays whatever might get nominated but they don't have a chance in hell winning ie.  Memento Ghost World Mulholland Drive etc.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS AHEADI've heard it been said that this film is not your typical Hollywood movie in that Ron Howard stays away from overt sentimentality swelling violins and other devices used to club audiences over the head and send them home in a euphoric feelgood haze that doesn't dissipate until the last bought and paidfor Academy Award is handed out on Oscar night.Yes Ron Howard stays away from overt sentimentality.  And he stays away from everything else too.  Including moments that might reveal character facts that would tell an honest cohesive story and ANYTHING that would help make a captive audience believe in and care about what they're watching. Instead we're led along through a series of hokey scenes showing John Nash at school clearly AN OUTSIDER watch how he upends a chess board!  thrill as he tosses furniture out of a window!  cheer while he launches a textbook into a garbage can and teaches the class HIS way!. Every time a moment comes along that might actually reveal character...SMASH!...cut to two years later.  Then Nash meets a girl in his class whose only apparent attribute is that she has the balls to tell a bunch of construction workers to shut up.  Soon they're pointing at stars then they're on a picnic then...BANG!...suddenly they're married!  The entire flick has this rapid TV movielike pacing.  Nothing is ever earned.  All of the scenes are thrown at us in neat easytodigest simpleforabigdumbaudiencetounderstand fashion.  Yet despite this rapid vapid pacing the movie drags and sags.As for a lack of swelling violins ubercomposer James Horner  raising Titanic  reprises the syrupy flutes from that film to indicate to the audience of this film that THIS IS AN EMOTIONAL MOMENT.  And a good thing too because the routine acting and the banal dialogue sure doesn't.Russell Crowe's acting is uneven at best.  In one scene he comes off as a shy innocent dullard then he's an arrogant prick then back again.  I understand he's supposed to be schizophrenic but there's a certain measuredness  a balanced realness  that's required to make any performance credible  even a schizophrenic.  This is not displayed at all and the result is that he lost my believability for the character and my sympathy for his situation.  Top that off with an Aussie accent one minute then some fakeo West Virginia country boy twang the next then back again....there's a hundred other actors that despite the handicap of Ron Howard's direction could have brought this role to life.  Don't get me wrong.  Russell Crowe is a great actor.  From Romper Stomper to The Insider he has given some amazing performances but he was really the wrong choice here.Jennifer Connelly so great in Requiem for a Dream gives a throwaway performance here.  In her defense the role written for her is a WASTE. In scene after stilted scene she plays the dutiful suffering wife. Fine she stuck with her husband throughout his ordeal such as it was....this movie's idea of the torment of an unhinged mind boils down to a roomful of magazine clippings and yarn! scary! but WHY!?  Why not invite the audience into her mind as well show us her trials her demons her reasons for hanging on?  Certainly someone living with a schizophrenic 24 hours a day must have some story of her own to tell?  Where is the slow measured wearingdown of HER sanity?  Instead we get a marginal acting job of a woman staring out a window with tears running down her face.  POOF!  Suddenly they have a child!  WHY!? Was this planned?  What are the ramifications now? How does Nash perceive the child?  When the baby almost drowns a scene that could have been and should have been extremely harrowing and emotionally wrenching I DIDN'T EVEN CARE!!Finally it's unclear what this film is even ABOUT.  Schizophrenia? Sybil  a TV movie  was far more compelling believable and informative.  A mathematician?  What did he accomplish?  Aside from the windowpane scrawlings at the beginning of the movie I never saw him contribute anything mathematical.  A teacher?  There is about five minutes of film showing him teaching but fails to detail his accomplishments his inspiration to his students his relationships with his peers and other faculty  NOTHING.  A Nobel Prize winner?  For what?  Admittedly I fell asleep during the last five or ten minutes of the film just prior to him making his big acceptance speech.  Perhaps I missed some bit of information but what did he win a Nobel Prize for being a psychotic jerk?  The movie neither shows nor tells anything that might support otherwise.In short this movie is bythenumbers filmmaking and continues to add to the lessthanlackluster directing talents of Ron Howard.  From what I understand John Nash lived quite a colorful life that included womanizing a nasty divorce homosexual affairs violent outbursts and strokes of mathematical genius that apparently changed our economic system.  Was any of this portrayed in this piteous watereddown film? NO!!! Somewhere here there is a good compelling story that should have been told by a better director  and a better writer it's not solely Howard's fault.  Instead we get this manipulative claptrap crowd pleaser showered with Oscar nominations and rather appropriately destined to take its place alongside The English Patient.  It's unfortunate that John Nash's life was reduced to this treacle.  This Beautiful Mind was a terrible thing for Ron Howard  and Akiva Goldsman  to waste.".

Additionally I think the 2002 Oscars was a rather poor year as although the film did win the Best Picture award the competition wasn't particularly strong. As a result of all these factors I think the film is overrated. Does that mean you should not watch it? Certainly not. Just understand that Hollywood often gets it wrongand they did here.

The sound technicians needed to work on those certain echoes on those certain details in each scene and the car noises in the background suddenly changes in between takes. That got annoying but I had to suck it up and watch the rest of the movie with the volume turned down. Not much blood for this slasher film as implied on the cover. But that didn't really matter to me. The movies biggest strength was the dialog and it was rather witty and intriguing to hear what the characters would say next. Character development for the teens were actually pretty darn good. Especially for the character Michelle and the guy who gang banged her with his buddy. Revenge is always stimulating as in most revenge films. But it wasn't really worth watching again. Although original in storyline. I just felt some of the methods in Bad Reputation were a little too old school as if it wanted to answer back to the slasher films of the 80's. Nightmare on Elm Street parts 1 through infinity and Heather's for example.But it does tend to reflect on current events in American schools. Kids these days get killed for less in school than what was portrayed here. But I finished this film with a sense of emptiness. I thought it was fair to give this a 410".

	schema:reviewBody "High school can be really hard times because a lot of changes occur. It is the transformation from childhood to adulthood which is the biggest challenge of all. There are different groups that everyone hangs out with such as jocks skaters goth emo kids stoners nerds etc. Guys can be cruel during this period where sex is everything along with reputation. Teens usually begin drinkingsmokingdrugsand of course have more sexual intercourse. To have a bad reputation is worse than being sent to Hell because everyone wants to be accepted by people and when they aren't then they try to do whatever it takes to fit in. The film Bad Reputation took me back to those crazy four years of my life where I cared more about what other people thought about me rather than what I saw within myself.Bad Reputation tells the story of a high school outcast named Michelle Rosen who spends her lunch breaks under a tree reading than hanging out with her classmates. One day the captain of the football team starts talking to her and invites her to his house for a kick ass party since his family is going to be out of town. She decides to attend unaware that Aaron and his friends plan to gang rape her. They give her a lot of alcohol then slip a date rape drug into her drink. Aaron acts like he is going to take her to lay down but then begins to get very rough with her as his friends come in for some of the action. Afterwards Debbi and Heather girlfriends of Aaron  his buddy duct tape Michelle to a tree in the backyard with the word SLUT written on her forehead to publicly humiliate her. Michelle returns to school finding posters advertising her as the school slut.She tries to tell everyone the truth by nobody believes her including her alcoholic mother is sex crazed guidance counselor. Michelle then decides it's time to get even so she returns dressed as the school slut and luring the kids that branded her to a bloody end. This film reminded me of several movies basically Cruel Intentions meets She's All That meets I Spit on Your Grave but never ripping these films off. Debbi and Aaron remind me a lot of Katherine and Sabastian from Cruel Intentions the way they ruin Michelle's life. The rape scene was not very explicit but you knew what was going on which made it that more effective. The murders were insane such as a guy being stabbed and the word FAG written on his head guy getting chopped up and placed in a suit case girl getting decapitatedand Aaron's death was the best one yet. Jim Hemphill has written a fantastic story that really makes you feel for the characters and is more realistic than anything. The actors also did a incredible job at making these characters very believable as well.Michelle is the kinda girl that guys should watch out for because she may be sweet but she can be very deadly. I actually knew a girl who was gang raped by guys like this so it made it that much more effective to watch this film. I truly recommend this film to every horrorrevenger slasher fan. Also there were a lot of other great reviews for this film and believe them folks because they know what they are talking about. I'm so glad that I've added Bad Reputation to my DVD collection and you should too! Definitely looking forward to seeing what DirectorWriter Jim Hemphill comes up with next!".

This is a highschool revenge movie that more or less follows the template established by Carrie and Christine although without the supernatural business. Still the idea is the same a harmless nerdy wallflower gets used and abused by the popular kids turns the tables and wreaks vengeance on her persecutors and then becomes so powermad that she destroys herself. The idea has been used so many times that its become almost mythic and a number of movies know how to use it. In the first half of the movie writerdirector Hemphill despite the obvious limitations with acting talent gets it mostly right he makes you identify with sweet Michelle the Henry Millerreading outcast who gets raped and humiliated at a party and so badly slandered at school that even the guidance counselor hits her up. Hemphill doesn't exploit her rape the way a lot of movies in the 1970s and 1980s might have with a lot of boob and butt shots where the rape becomes a kind of vicarious thrill for the audience. Instead he makes it ugly and then further ratchets up the collective audience hatred for the perps by adding insult to injury as both the rapists and their snotty viciously cliquish girlfriends conspire to trash Michelle's rep at school. All fine and good because you know there is going to be a payoff that these jerks and bitches will pay for this sins. Unfortunately for the audience Michelle goes overnight from being sympathetic victim to inhuman monster. Sure you want the bad guys painfully punished but what we get is just prolonged torture  which is torture is sit through. It's unpleasant disgusting ugly and a lot less fun than it sounds. Although it was kinda funny to watch her bash one guy with a textbook so badly that blood spattered the walls. Was this one of those switchbladewielding history books? Heathers from which it borrows freely got away with a lot of the same material because it was more capably written and wickedly funny. Here you just have the increasingly unlikable Michelle wearily rampaging her bloody way through the student body all but leaving aside any question of how she manages to get away with it. I guess part of the reason is that her town has by my count only two police officers who only appear for a couple minutes and ask maybe one question. Also Michelle is apparently an expert at cutting up and disposing of the body of a guy she kills in her own bedroom. No I guess you shouldn't demand that much of movies as lowbudget as this one. Writerdirector Hemphill certainly didn't.".

It's weak and strong in many areas but it's better than most of the lame films that come out for teens for the 21st century. The acting reminds me of 80's type but more updated for the time frame it came out yet similar to I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE and other classic horror movies. Not saying the film is perfect or a copycat ... but it's not bad for some debut film for such a hot messy topic. Rape exists everywhere in high school and in college. The rape scene is very familiar to many girls who have undergone such traumatic experience in reality on or off campus. The cliques of these ugly groups fits the T of any American typical high school group. I watched this on Hulu for the first time and was laughing yet emotional at the same time for such bad ass kids who think they truly rule. Or the fact that this girl was screwed with in many tormenting ways that any teen can definitely relate to. Good anger and aggression! And I appreciate the fact that this film gets back at men   especially with the penis slashing. Women are always depicted as rape victims and never fight back. Well in this case she does. And it's great to see another cheap horror film do well in such arena with feelings  emotions. I watched the entire film and new it was cheesy. If you think back to old movies like bad acting in Halloween or any other cheeseball slasher flick bad acting will always exist to a degree but it wasn't all that bad in BAD REPUTATION. The characters were well developed and I could see the points in between where during takes laughter or humor slipped in   but all low budget films start out as such. Laugher is the best medicine. So thumbs up! I laughed. Better than watching THE RING or some other gay horror flick.If you want a cheesy film to watch with friends then this is it. Grab your popcorn and beer and laugh. But as you watch and are drawn into the film the topics are well picked and make you think in the end   AND during the movie. And this is obviously what the writer  director intended and managed to show on the silver screen. ".

They're neat ideas but everything is offcamera likely due to budget constraints. The acting is decent and the dialogue bounces between witty and eyerollworthy. Overall not a bad movie and it gets kudos for not going the glossy teengirlbentonrevenge horror route I'm lookin' at you Tamara and instead exploring sex doublestandards and how truly horrible teenagers can be to each other.";

It's more of a psychological drama a bit of a slow starter as well until all the pieces are put together and it starts making sense. To be honest the less you know about the story the better otherwise it will ruin your enjoyment The acting is excellent I would say it really is Eva Green's movie she shines throughout the movie with a rather difficult role and is absolutely beautiful. Sam Riley and Ryan Philippe are very good too although they have a little less material to play with.

Peter goes to visit his son that is wanted by the police and waits for him in the same restaurant that Milo will meet Sally. The worlds of these characters are entwined with revelations about painful truths.Franklyn is an intriguing and original movie about distorted minds protecting painful truths. The screenplay keeps the mystery until the very end and the visual concept of Meanwhile City is twisted like the mind of David Esser. Eva Green is impressively beautiful even performing a character without glamor. The beginning is hard to follow but if the viewer gives a chance he or she will will not be disappointed.

	schema:headline " Daringly unique and visionary British film with plenty to offer";
	schema:reviewBody "I have just got back from watching Franklyn at the London Film Festival and let me tell you this film is truly something special. A cleverly coordinated lesson in narrative structure the plot revolves around 4 different people delivered in 4 different strands of plot one of which exists in somewhere a little futuristic called Meanwhile City. Each of the four are all trying to fix something in their lives. DONT WORRY I SHALL NOT BE Writing ANY SPOILERS HERE At first my mind was drawn to the film V for Vendetta  the masked vigilante played very well by Ryan Phillipe holding his own in a predominantly British cast seemed to be a similar character complete with voiceover telling us the troubles of Meanwhile City. But soon the other plot strands filter in and it becomes far more than a Vendettalite imitation with a narrative structure very similar in delivery to Magnolia or Gomorrah. However the director here never makes it confusing as to who is who with a definite and focused script keeping the four strands together very well.All the other stories are set in contemporary London. My favourite was the story with Sam Riley's character. His bride to be has left him and he is finding ways of dealing with his grief. Elsewhere Bernard Hill plays a man searching for his son who has mysteriously gone missing. The other story strand involves Eva Green as a troubled artist with a penchant for frequently attempting suicide.Whilst the photography and direction in the film is brilliantly vivid and bold and the cast are wonderfully believable what really sold this film for me was the story itself. Intriguing exciting thoughtful often very moving and most of all constantly surprising Franklyn is by far the most fiercely intelligent and engaging film i have watched in a very long time. The final 10 minutes are simply amazing and very very clever dont read ANYTHING about it though! Make sure to watch Franklyn when it comes out the LFF was a lucky early screening I am told it could be out in January at the cinemas nationwide. BUT WHATEVER YOU DO MAKE SURE NO ONE TELLS YOU ANYMORE THAN THE SYNOPSIS TELLS YOU! else you will not experience the joy of watching the story unravel and reveal itself for its truths. Thank you to all involved in creating something so utterly unique in its execution.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's not fair to criticise just for the sake of it but it's not possible to state my criticisms without spoilering the movie bigtime. So if you don't want to read spoilers stop here.We have four seemingly unconnected story threads. One concerns a man called Preest Ryan Phillippe wearing a fullface hood in a dystopic alternative reality place called Meanwhile City where he expects to carry out an assassination. The second concerns Esser Bernard Hill travelling from Cambridge to London in search of his son. The third concerns Emilia Eva Green carrying out suicide attempts as a kind of performance art project. The fourth involves Milo Sam Riley moping around with all sorts of personal problems following his wedding not taking place. These threads limp slowly onwards with nothing much happening until the twothirds mark at which point we finally begin to find stuff out spoilers start here. We discover that Preest is actually Esser's son that he is a mentally disturbed serviceman who has escaped from a mental hospital killing someone as he did so and that Meanwhile City is nothing but a highly detailed delusion.

But I do like to be entertained and I don't like being bored. This film bored me and failed to entertain me and left me feeling distinctly unsatisfied. I got the impression that the film thought it was a great deal cleverer than I thought it was. I encourage potential viewers to read Will Wright's criticisms  a wellreasoned critique from someone who knows what he's talking about.Bernard Hill was excellent his character was boring. Eva Green was excellent her character Emilia wasn't boring Sally was though. She was sexy and deeply worrying  she can be very scary. She was much more scary than Ryan Phillippe who left no impression on me at all. Neither did Sam Riley.Oh and who or what is Franklyn? I know Bernard Hill queried seeing the name on some document or other with no explanation or clarification but did I miss it being mentioned elsewhere?".

	onyx:emotionText "It's not fair to criticise just for the sake of it but it's not possible to state my criticisms without spoilering the movie bigtime. So if you don't want to read spoilers stop here.We have four seemingly unconnected story threads. One concerns a man called Preest Ryan Phillippe wearing a fullface hood in a dystopic alternative reality place called Meanwhile City where he expects to carry out an assassination. The second concerns Esser Bernard Hill travelling from Cambridge to London in search of his son. The third concerns Emilia Eva Green carrying out suicide attempts as a kind of performance art project. The fourth involves Milo Sam Riley moping around with all sorts of personal problems following his wedding not taking place. These threads limp slowly onwards with nothing much happening until the twothirds mark at which point we finally begin to find stuff out spoilers start here. We discover that Preest is actually Esser's son that he is a mentally disturbed serviceman who has escaped from a mental hospital killing someone as he did so and that Meanwhile City is nothing but a highly detailed delusion. And we discover that Milo has had an imaginary friend Sally since childhood who helps him through bad times played by Eva Green in a bad red wig she has now put in a reappearance.

	schema:reviewBody "The best film I have seen this year so far its so brilliantly strange and such a brainteasingly satisfying film to watch.The film is a scifi thrillerdrama about four characters dealing with problems in their life from Eva Greens character who is a suicidal artist to Sam Riley's character whose bride ran away at the altar. These characters parts of the film are set in modern day London and their struggles may seem uninteresting at first but once the films pace sets in their stories take on as much importance as the real main character Preest. Jonathon Preest the mysterious loner of the films alternate reality Meanwhile City is the only atheist in a city gripped by Faith where every resident must have a religion which lends weight to the films plot and themes.All the cast were very good at their parts Phillippe does well as Preest without going into deep voiced batman territory and Eva Green portrays her very flawed character with enough humanity to keep you interested without becoming fed up with her characters behaviour.The film constantly switches between the two settings to both dramatic effect and to keep the film moving at a solid pace that should have you guessing at the link between all the characters and how the alternate reality of Meanwhile city ties in with them. Meanwhile City itself is a stunning and darkly captivating location for the other half of the film and provides the visual cement to the films concepts and makes for some of the most inventive design I've seen in sets and costumes for a long time. Its a Gothic vision of skyscrapers and futuristic landscapes with inspiration from cathedrals and ancient architecture. Its safe to say that you shouldn't let anyone spoil the films twists or plot for you because its twists often seem predictable before hand but upon their realisation they can be quite surprising reveals.For those familiar with films such as Donnie Darko the ideas driving the film may seem to be done and dusted but Franklyn's fresh approach to the concepts as well as its stunning execution make this film worthy of anyone looking to engage their thoughts in some very interesting concepts regarding reality and perception. Go out and watch this film it's conclusion will linger with you for days after wards.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are movies that despite their lack of budget and filmmakers' experience within the medium of filmdespite their failings in telling a coherent and entertaining story nevertheless excel in their ability to enthral through idea and theme alone. Franklyn which too often sets out in this manner in turn neglecting engaging narrative for contorted mysterytinged manipulation is not one of those select few features. Restricted by a small budget and the director and writers' inexperience with feature length productions the film is interesting to a certain degree but too often falls flat when trying to compel the viewer either through character or plot. Indeed the only sole reason to continue watching a film such as Franklyn is to find out what the hell is going on and then you get to that finish line only to realise that the payoff isn't quite what you expected. The result is a feature that feels halfbaked underdeveloped and frustratingly vague for its first two acts. So much so that by the time director Gerald McMorrow decides to show us his hand we've more or less left the table and cashed in our chips.The problem with Franklyn isn't that it is short on ideas but that it is short on ideas upon which to implement the themes and arcs to which McMorrow obviously wants to get across. For sure this is an original interesting and intriguing piece of work but it's also dreary and tiresome at the same time. First time viewers should not be alarmed if plot details go amiss or if the story seems overly convoluted disconnected and a little contrivedbecause this is exactly how McMorrow pens his tale. It's deliberately withholding for a reason and that is because without that sense of mysticism and deliberate manipulation Franklyn is a mirthless experience. Taken on face value in retrospect the ninety minutes doesn't feel completely wasted but there is a certain degree of fallacy involved here that comes off as cheap and overly ambitious. Indeed this is a bold effort from the firsttime filmmaker and one has to applaud such an audacious venturebut it's also very hard to be convinced by Franklyn either in its grandiose tale or its dubiously surreal and contorted narrative.For the majority of the feature we are treated to four stories revolving around four separate characters split over what appears to be two very different timelines of alternate dimensions this is of course merely a subjective speculation on the part of myself as the truth behind the events of the film are never truly explainedand fair enough I suppose. Each of the characters have their own little quirks Emilia Eva Green is an extremist artist driven to videotape serial suicide attempts made by herself Milo Sam Riley a romantic who has recently been left at the alter a masked vigilante named Preest Ryan Phillippe who occupies the alternate reality within a city named Meanwhile City ruled by religion and dogmatic oppression and a father in search of his son gone missing after a traumatic event involving his sister's death.At first all the characters within Franklyn's two worlds seem distinct from each other and without and form of linkso much so that much of the feature's initial hour is slow moving and irksomely disjointed from any sort of clear focus or direction to the first time viewer. Yet as the plot unravels and metaphysical realities are explored with death imaginary friends and delusional beliefs briefly analysed the seeds that are planted during the initial acts begin to blossom. It is disappointing then that by the time McMorrow pulls the proverbial rug on us we don't really care anymore. Confined also by the limitations of such vague narrative and an ending that brings everything together in a poetic but fruitless manner Franklyn eventually crumbles under its own weight and pretension. It's a movie that tries too hard to be larger than it really is on paper and the cracks are all too obvious.In the end I wanted to like McMorrow's work here a lot more than I actually didit's brave interesting and makes some intriguing statements on the nature of reality and our perceptions of such manifestations to ourselves as human beings but at the end of the day I couldn't bring myself to be convinced or won over by the implementation of such ideas. For sure there was potential here within the barebones skeleton of McMorrow's premise and themesbut burdened with obstructive restrictions both in a narrative sense and a production sense Franklyn simply never comes off the page like it should and the result is lukewarm in every regard sporadically intriguing but overly flawedI have to wonder why this made the big screen at all I got the feeling that it could have made an even better miniseries for TV.A review by Jamie Robert Ward httpwww.invocus.net".

	schema:headline " Oh my goth what a good movie";
	schema:reviewBody "If you like dark Gothic movies with both style  intelligence this one's for you. Firsttime directorwriter Gerald McMorrow makes a great debut with Franklyn a cryptic fantasythriller about 4 lost souls in different times  places bound together by a mystery that slowly unravels to a brilliant climax.The story is told in fragments and if you're not paying attention you might easily get lost. But that's what makes it so rewarding when you start to figure it out and you realize what these people have in common.Most of the action happens in a nightmarish dystopian world called Meanwhile City. These scenes are reminiscent of the haunting works of Alex Proyas The Crow Dark City with bits of Frank Miller's comic book style Sin City The Spirit. There are also some refreshing humorous nods toward Terry Gilliam Brazil 12 Monkeys. But what sets this apart from those dark shadowy films is the juxtaposition of contemporary London bright  crisp like something you'd see by the German master Tom Tykwer Run Lola Run Heaven Perfume.If you don't recognize all those names don't worry. The point I'm making is that McMorrow's directorial debut has elements of many great directors tied together in a fresh original way.There's not as much action in this film as in most fantasythrillers. Depending on how you like your movies that's either a good thing or a bad thing. I thought it was perfect because it lets the story breathe and it gives us the chance to digest the slowlyunravelling mystery. There are interwoven themes touching on religion individuality family fate love  hate. And psychosis which always makes things fun.And even though it may be light on action  explosions there's tons of nice eye candy to keep you riveted. Speaking as a hetero male by eye candy I mean Eva Green and her sexy goth wardrobe! If I weren't such a hetero guy I'd be tempted to become a cross dresser. The 2 leading men are quite the lookers too both suave  classy in their own way. And if that's not enough eye candy you can't miss the enormous sets  wide angle shots breathtaking.If you're a fan of any of the directorsfilms I mentioned above don't hesitate to check this out.".

These scenes are reminiscent of the haunting works of Alex Proyas The Crow Dark City with bits of Frank Miller's comic book style Sin City The Spirit. There are also some refreshing humorous nods toward Terry Gilliam Brazil 12 Monkeys. But what sets this apart from those dark shadowy films is the juxtaposition of contemporary London bright  crisp like something you'd see by the German master Tom Tykwer Run Lola Run Heaven Perfume.If you don't recognize all those names don't worry. The point I'm making is that McMorrow's directorial debut has elements of many great directors tied together in a fresh original way.There's not as much action in this film as in most fantasythrillers. Depending on how you like your movies that's either a good thing or a bad thing. I thought it was perfect because it lets the story breathe and it gives us the chance to digest the slowlyunravelling mystery. There are interwoven themes touching on religion individuality family fate love  hate. And psychosis which always makes things fun.And even though it may be light on action  explosions there's tons of nice eye candy to keep you riveted. Speaking as a hetero male by eye candy I mean Eva Green and her sexy goth wardrobe! If I weren't such a hetero guy I'd be tempted to become a cross dresser. The 2 leading men are quite the lookers too both suave  classy in their own way. And if that's not enough eye candy you can't miss the enormous sets  wide angle shots breathtaking.If you're a fan of any of the directorsfilms I mentioned above don't hesitate to check this out.";

	schema:headline " A thought provoking film but not in the way some people think";
	schema:reviewBody "I am frankly surprised almost to the point of shock that so many people have such a hard time following this movie. It is very straight forward in its story telling. The only reason i can imagine anyone not following it is either a confusion by the mislabeling of this film as a science fiction film its not its a psychodrama OR b geekish yearnings to make the sci fi setting 'real'. The ironic thing about b is that those people who do twist the world in such a way are in fact illustrating what this movie is all about which is the human ability to divorce ones perceptions from reality. The main characters exist in a spectrum of dissociation. 1 DavidJonathan Priest is a recently returned war veteran who is dealing with the trauma of the senseless death of his baby sister. Of all the characters he is the most disassociated from reality to the point where he has created an entirely divergent internallyconsistent reality for himself. We would call such a person dissociative or psychotic normally but this movie shows him not as unique but merely as an extreme in a continuum of human behavior. 2 Milo created a fantasy friend. Sally as a child to cope with the death of his father. To him Sally is part of his reality a part that again is only part of his own perceptions. When his life hits a crisis of loneliness in the loss of his fiance he brings Sally back into his world. Again we would view this as a lesser form of disassociationpsychotic break by our normal yardsticks. But there are even more shades here. 3 Emelia has also created a break with reality because of trauma in this case her childhood abuse sexual is suggested but never totally stated by her father. Choosing to forget that and remember it as stories not reality she has substituted a desperate longing for a father that she thinks she lost though chances are he never really existed as she remembers him. Rather then blame herself for the sexual abuse as victims commonly do she has substituted a blame of her mother for taking her father away. She acts out her inner turmoil and attacks her mother through staged art suicides. It could be argued that these are also her attempts on some level to punish herself but thats never developed in the movie. Nonetheless it generally takes either severe depression or severe guilt to bring one to the brink of suicide. 4 David's father has the same trauma that David has the traffic accident death of his daughter David's little sister In his case he is clinging to a hard line religious explanation. That it was God's will and God's actions. This gives a senseless and horrible death a little girl struck down by a car meaning and allows him to deal with it. It can be argued however that this TOO is a disassociation from the reality that random horrible things happen without purpose or reason. That is a reality that many people we would consider normal to flee from and make up stories to hide behind instead. And in the end thats what this movie is about as explained in the story that Sally tells Milo about the story teller who built a perfect world but in the end walked away from it because it wasn't real. And the real and only question this movie leaves is that what stories do WE live in rather then dealing with reality and which is really better? Is believing in a cold uncaring random world more healthy just because it is real? or do we as human beings by our very nature live in worlds of fantasy in order to function? As for the final shot of the bucket and mob without the janitor by it that is open for debate but I see it as a tease.. daring US to interpret the janitor's part in the film not as just one more random element in a random world but as something with deeper and perhaps mystical meaning. The author leaves that for us the viewers to weave fantasies about.".

A hybrid in terms of style Franklyn might best be described as Frank Miller the artist meets The Dark Knight Batman in Brazil the movie. I say this because none of these items alone help explain the convolutedness that is this story and none should. It goes beyond them. Way beyond them.Visually appealing on almost every level Franklyn has two divergent stories that seem to have nothing to do with each other. In one we're privy to a kind of superhero trying to avenge the death of a young girl whom we know nothing about. He chases after The Individual in a city known as Meanwhile. Looking as stated earlier somewhere along the lines of a Frank Miller graphic mixed with a kind of Dark Knight quality the story intrigues and makes us cheer on the main character Jonathan Preest Ryan Philleppe FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS. I mean trying to avenge the death of an innocent girl is noble right? Equally intriguing within the city of Meanwhile are the many religions that flourish including the Seventh Day Manicurists. Everyone is required to have a religious affiliation ...except our hero who is subsequently tracked by highly skilled fighting monks.In the second story a woman named Emilia Eva Green THE GOLDEN COMPASS tries to come to terms with her life and her art. She consistently tries to kill herself for the sake of it only to learn that her art just isn't inspiring enough. Also a man in search of his missing son comes to the psychiatrist who'd been treating him only to learn that his son escaped and is out in the world with a rifle slung over his shoulder.As the two story lines begin to mesh reality skews men and women we thought we knew either don't exist exist as something else or are strictly symbols including a janitor who plays a vital role. The fascination the viewer will feel at the realizations of what is coming will shock delight and sink their heart. Yes it's THAT good.The visuals are what will initially draw you in. You'll be asking yourself Why? many times Why is the city so muted? Why is he wearing a mask? Why are these religious fanatics chasing him? If you pay close attention everything is answered in one final scene which in itself reveals amazing storytelling.I can't stress enough how closely everything is linked in the film and how paying attention reaps great benefits in the end. Even the names of the characters Preest The Individual Wormsnakes Pastor Bone all have relevance.Made on a paltry 12 million budget the movie feels much more expensive and expansive. Sadly it did not get a wide release and suffered because of it. Not many people have ever heard of it. I know I never had until a friend I work with mentioned it. But I'm glad he pointed me in the right direction. This one's a hidden gem. And it's so original that you'll wonder which genre you're watching. I'm still wondering!".

	schema:headline " clever but not too much for its own good.";
	schema:reviewBody "I will not divulge any of the film plot as this will ruin the movie for prospective viewers. What i will say is that this film is an artistic creative and inward glance of the troubled human mind. Directionally it is smooth and intricately woven together along with fantastic casting. Stick with the storyline and you will be rewarded. For me the story borrows ideologically from movies such as 'a beautiful mind' and 'fight club'  with the dark fantasy sceneryfeel of 'Dark City' or 'equilibrium' and the mysterious links of 'the machinist' i feel there is a little Bladerunner tribute in 'meanwhile city' at the beginning of the movie when a camera shot of a busy metropolis at street level  in the rain pans up to the sky's to reveal dark  heavy  tall imperialistic buildings complete with oversized statues. The only two things missing were Deckard and the floating coca cola blimp.I'm guessing that this film is going to equal out here at IMDb ratings as between 5 and 7 stars. I firmly believe this because dare i say it  a LOT of people simply are not going to understand it. Its incredibly cleverbut... brilliantly NOT to much for its own good. It has a heavy artistic slant at the beginning that leads you to think that this movie is trying to be pompous and only to appeal to either students or the conceptual but the heavy art subsides gradually to a sense of normality and it is this that drives the story. Just as Kubrick's 'a clockwork orange' uses language heavily to start with to explain that gangs have a language alien to so called 'normal people' with the language narrative becoming more coherent as the the lead 'Alex' becomes 'Normalised'  the heavy artistic tones in Franklyn are there to describe the 'other world' and as you start to understand the movie  the director uses less. It works at all times and when the dust disappears from your eyes and you are left with clarity of what is going on  you will be rewarded for what is a very slow starting movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "I will not divulge any of the film plot as this will ruin the movie for prospective viewers. What i will say is that this film is an artistic creative and inward glance of the troubled human mind. Directionally it is smooth and intricately woven together along with fantastic casting. Stick with the storyline and you will be rewarded. For me the story borrows ideologically from movies such as 'a beautiful mind' and 'fight club'  with the dark fantasy sceneryfeel of 'Dark City' or 'equilibrium' and the mysterious links of 'the machinist' i feel there is a little Bladerunner tribute in 'meanwhile city' at the beginning of the movie when a camera shot of a busy metropolis at street level  in the rain pans up to the sky's to reveal dark  heavy  tall imperialistic buildings complete with oversized statues. The only two things missing were Deckard and the floating coca cola blimp.I'm guessing that this film is going to equal out here at IMDb ratings as between 5 and 7 stars.

This movie is not very highly rated but I feel that is because it isn't the usual Hollywood fare people are used to. This movie is not for everyone it is very dark and deals with disturbing subject matters. It can't quite be classified as Scifi but it contains strange fantasy elements within the movie. It is hard to describe without spoiling some of the uniqueness for the first time viewer. I am certain I will be watching this movie far more than once. It has a very convoluted plot that is not going to appeal to the actioncomedyromance or whatever else crowd. I found this one of the most compelling movies I have ever watched. I would rate it along the lines of Donnie Darko or Watchmen for dark yet thought provoking material. It will leave you feeling a little disturbed but in awe as the strange tale unfolds. This movie deserves to be seen by a far larger audience as it is an artistic masterpiece compared to the standard drivel Hollywood pumps out. Do your self a favour and set the time aside with no interruptions to really do this movie justice. You won't regret it.".

Most of the commentators here have identified the problems with this film but I still recommend Franklyn. Why? For most first time film makers Franklyn contains all the pitfalls that should be avoided. But the irony is Franklyn is a great idea that dies through amateur film making. Good movies are most of the time simple and quick. Even if the idea is sophisticated the rendering of it should not be. But Franklyn's script is the primary fault written by a first timer who's not noticed its errors. The author hasn't identified the important parts of his story. Preest his father and Emilia are the centre of the film but instead we get a massive wtf Milo subplot and trips to see a mystically pointless hospital janitor. Meanwhile City works and while we can always compare it to Bladerunner we shouldn't. Ridley Scott didn't invent the dystopian metropolis Fritz Lang did. And as a metropolis for characters to move through it function's superbly. We just never see them move through it enough!Preest's fantasy city is where the film should focus Emilia should feature here somehow yet Eva Green's too busy playing Milo's imaginary girlfriend instead of opposite Ryan Philippe. And then when you do get in the city it's too brief and becomes a dull soap opera moping around London. I've no problem with duel reality similar to Identity but like that film it became all too one sided.The trick to good screenplay is simple learn to spot the errors before you spend 10 million on them. Then as Hitchcock said directing a film is simple have a good script when you start. Of course we then realise it isn't that simple I've also experienced a small production where the first time writerproducer not me clung too much to their ideas and defended the mistakes rather that address them. A script can be about anything but it must not contain 'code' than makes the movie machine seize up. The character and events of Milo are a prime example. Suppose we dump this waste of space and just push Emilia and Preest closer together give them more to do in Meanwhile. I wanted Franklyn to work but it didn't. The script was rushed it was based on a short story by the director and was never good enough. But the fact it got made is a triumph albeit for all the wrong reasons. I will happily add Franklyn to the shelf with Dune Dark City etc despite its list of well meant errors.PS One commentator here suggested the music and photography were poor. This is hogwash. Both were impressive for a small budget film.".

The original was a wonderful novel. It has been done quite well at least three times before with Gregory Peck Patrick Stewart or Jack Aranson as Ahab. Orson Welles made a short of it. A new version is coming out with William Hurt as Ahab and I look forward to it. Even if the script had been decent I think Barry Bostwick would have been out of his league playing Ahab.The special effects aren't that bad but it takes so little to do that these days. What was AWFUL was how they used them. The whale looks to be the size of an island simply bigger than any animal has ever been found to be.I could go on and on and on.

	schema:reviewBody "When I first heard people criticizing this movie I wrote them off as the typical whiners that accompany the release of any outrageously farfetched monster movie. Of course whales can't grow to the size 2 football stadiums and of course they can't snatch helicopters out of the airthat's why it's fiction! It's precisely this outrageous scale and the novelty of seeing the impossible that makes these films so entertaining and thrilling. However this time the criticism proved to be 100 deserved.Scifi B movies have their place in my heart. And I actually quite enjoyed Peter Benchley's The Beast and its epic portrayal of a giant maneating squid. That was a madeforTV movie from 1996 fourteen years later we have 2010 Moby Dick. But although CGI has made huge leaps in the intervening years and no doubt costs far less these days Moby Dick's special effects are still laughably bad in comparison. They simply come off as cheap and very rushed.To be fair the whale itself although a bit too sharklike IMO as seen in the movie poster isn't all that bad. It's not the best CG ever but it's respectable for a lowbudget movie. However much of the supporting special effects used throughout the movie is very poorly done with no attention to detail.For example we've all seen underwater explosions on TV and in movies. When something blows up under water the explosion has a very distinct look there's cavitation a bright flash and lots of gas bubbles. Not in Moby Dick though... In Moby Dick the underwater explosions are simply dry explosions taken from stock footage sloppily overlaid on top of a poorly rendered underwater scene. The result is an entirely unrealistic effect that precludes audience engagement in the story. I mean there are Xbox games that have more convincing underwater action sequences.Another example of the sloppy effects in this movie involves a scene in which a dead school of squid are supposedly being shown floating to the ocean surfacethat's what is described in the dialog at least. But instead we're shown a shot of the ocean overlaid with blurry blownup photos of 2 enormoussized squids. And not only are the squids very poorly pasted into the scene imagine a really bad Photoshop job but as the camera pans being shot from a moving helicopter the squid cut outs move completely out of sync with the background the ocean surface. No attempt is made to synchronize the squid overlays with the camera movements or the corresponding perspective changes. And it's scenes like these that make the film look so amateurish and cheesy. You might expect this from a local cable access program or a Conan O'Brien skit but not a feature film.Sadly as the movie intensifies and the stunts get ever more outrageous the effort made by the filmmakers and special effects team seem to decrease. By the end of the movie when the audience ought to be sitting on the edge of their seats gripped by the explosive action as they approach the big finale they're instead completely detached from the onscreen action the sloppiness of the film having worn away any suspension of disbelief they had. So when the big finale does come they're no longer emotionally invested in the characters or plot enough to care.Although Barry Bostwick delivers an impassioned performance as Captain Ahab Renee O'Connor Gabrielle from TV's Xena the female lead is unconvincing in her role as a marine biologist. And for good measure a few peripheral military characters also deliver some spectacularly bad acting during their few seconds on screen.This is just a really shoddily made movie. There's no other way to put it. It would have been better had they cast Jack Black as Ahab and turned it into an intentionally cheesy comedyspoof. However this movie tries to take itself seriously and aims to be a big action monster movie but the production team clearly weren't willing to make the effort for it to work.I don't believe in such a thing as being untalented just laziness and sloppiness. And that's what killed this movie. The sad part is most of the problems don't seem to be budget related and the individuals involved are clearly capable of producing quality work if they simply paid more attention to detail and set higher standards.".

He has pics of movies execs in the hot tub with some underage action?? And they give Melville a nod as contributing writer. Btw he has returned from the dead and he looks mighty mad !!".

The whale is 500 feet long how can it hide on a beach that's roughly 12 feet deep? 2 Compared to an Ohio class submarine 560 feet long and a Virginia class submarine 377 feet long why are they severely dwarfed compared to a 500 foot whale? 3 Too liberal use of nukes... 4 How could anyone survive 3 nukes going into an island? I could go on but at that point I'd be rambling. This movie was bad to the point that it wasn't even enjoyable as a joke B movie.

This occurred while on some kind of intelligence gathering mission in Russian waters on a submarine where he was then a lowly sonar operator or something. The movie then jumps from there to the present where a much older captain Ahab has ditched the old ship of yore for a sleek black state of the art sub called the Pequod with all the bells and whistles which he designed himself. Apparently the navy knew nothing about his hidden agenda when they allowed him to do this and give him command of it.Later they become concerned when Ahab stops checking in and is spotted where he's not supposed to be based on the orders he was given. Coupled with this are reported incidents of ships being sunk and people killed. The navy conclude that Ahab has somehow flipped and gone rogue and is responsible for these incidents. Orders are issued to find him and stop him. In the mean time Ahab is underwater in the Pequod with a serious hardon for Moby Dick har har me mateys and oblivious for the time being that the navy is after him. Joining him and his crew aboard the sub are a female scientist specializing in whales and her assistant whom while out testing the effects of some recorded whale cries Ahab commandeered for the purpose of helping him track Moby.The movie is a middle budgettolow budget movie seems to me because the whale and the effects in general could have been better though it was passable. The continuity didn't seem too good near the end either. Seems like they were shortcutting. Observe also the classic use of one wellknown old time actor and a whole bunch you never heard of. But money by itself doesn't necessarily make a good movie and we've all seen examples of this truth. The script and the ability to creatively make the most of what you got is what counts. So what about the script? Not great slightly below average as well needed more imagination or innovation in it. Or at least more laughs intentional or unintentional. For instance Ahab did make me chuckle once or twice near the end where he came off as not only insane but ridiculously insane. Was this because of good acting or bad acting? You tell me. Finally nothing exceptional here wouldn't rush to see it. It would make a bigger splash har har on TV watching in your underwear with your favorite snacks on one side and your favorite person on the other. Love Boloxxxi.".

The CGI is one of the worst I have seen. The script is written in two lines line one we have to kill Moby dick line two he can't be killed. Some scene's did indeed remind me of Mega Piranha for example the helicopter scene but that must be the best part. On the DVD you have some gag reel and I enjoyed that part more than the flick itself. There are really some stupid things going on like the torpedo story at the end with two soldiers just waiting for impact and others trying to kill Moby with a shotgun. No I didn't enjoy it and I have seen creature features from all era's. Moby Dick was just a teaser to attract fans of the original one and the sleeve is influenced by Jaws but for the rest it was utterly a Moby Turkey what a Dick he is.".

There is one scene when the submarine has to do an emergency surface and shoots hundreds of feet out of the water totally believable!. Towards the end Moby Dick comes out of the water climbs the island then throws itself off the top of the island and lands on a poor seaman. Poor Poor Poor.

	schema:reviewBody "Easy Money or Snabba Cash to give it its original Swedish title was originally released in Sweden in 2010 a full three years before it reached the UK by which time the sequel snappily entitled Snabba Cash II had already been out for a year in Scandinavia. Perhaps that at least ensures we won't need to wait too long to find out what happens to the surviving characters.With three strands that entwine into a single story Easy Money is a violent at times bloody peek under the tarpaulin that covers the Serbian mafia and its nefarious dealings with drugs and murder. JW Joel Kinnaman is a cleancut law student with money issues until the opportunity to run drugs ends the former and resolves the latter. With a girlfriend Sophie Lisa Henni from the right side of town and employers from the wrong side his life becomes complicated and very tense. Caught between Jorge Mateas Varela a fugitive on the run from the cops and the Serbian mafia and Mrado Dragomir Mrsic a mafia hard man JW winds up in some very deep dodo indeed Easy Money carves up the screen in a similar vein to this year's Dead Man Down but lacks the panache. Where as Colin Farrell's film had a certain smoothness to the violence this is gritty and unfinished. It feels a little rushed at times but that's part of the attraction. You really don't want to mess with any of these characters. Ever.It's very easy to like JW even though everything screams that he's a fool who is willingly corrupting himself. It doesn't take a genius to work out there'll be serious consequences come the end of the film but for whom? Kinnaman who boosted his international profile with The Killing is on excellent form here. Think Jonathan Rhys Meyers in Match Point only better. Much much better.The characters are rounded well enough for us to step back from them but not so much that they appear sculpted film characters rather than raw unpleasant lowlifes who'll blow you away if it's ever a threat to their survival.Easy Money is always compelling and the twohour running time whizzes by in an instant. Alas by sheer dint of it being in foreign language it is unlikely to garner much of an audience in the UK and USA I was the sole occupant of the cinema last night and whilst it was a joy for me it doesn't bode well for the chances of the sequel hitting Bristol.For the philistines who are unable to watch and read the screen simultaneously Easy Money is good enough to have been awarded an unnecessary Hollywood remake staring Zac Effron. I have nothing against Effron on the contrary he impressed me in The Paperboy last year it's just that Hollywood does have a tendency to take excellent foreign language films and mutilate them. Disagree? Compare and contrast Let The Right One In with Let Me In or The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and its remake or the Hollywood adaptation of TV's The Killing or When will Hollywood learn? Stop remaking the great films and TV series and take a look at those that should have been good but bombed. I'm not judging the remake of Easy Money before the cameras even start rolling but take it from me it's unlikely to improve on the original. It's certainly no date movie but a gritty thriller that will happily consume any Friday night.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.".

Many times in Hollywood movies we see an Englishspeaking actor playing a foreign character and you can hear an accent. Hollywood thinks they can get away with it because the Americans won't notice. This may be true but this alone is worth 1 point out of 10. If I am watching some Serbians talking among themselves I want it to be as real as possible. Only a Serb knows how to talk like a Serb and only a German knows how to talk like a German. And the same goes vice versa only an American should play an American. And that's what this movie has. It has actors that play characters from their homeland. This film teaches you how quickly life can turn the other cheek especially in the crime world. The innocence portrayed by our lead character JW played by Joel Kinnaman takes you right into this. He gets himself involved in a world where he naturally doesn't belong by making an important decision at the beginning of the film. The movie takes you through all of his emotions as he learns more and more about this new world.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first time I saw this film I had just finished the book. Simply loved the book and I was really looking forward to the movie adaptation. At first I found myself disappointed. The problem according to me was how they had handled the material. The movie just felt like a too trimmed down and simplified adaptation. I understand that you can't bring the entire book to the big screen but this felt rushed and simple. Character that felt vastly different to their counterparts in the book. It took quite some time before I saw the film again. I decided to try being more objective not keep irritating myself over the changes. Take it for what it is and not what it could and maybe should have been. Ive seen it several times since often with long breaks between meaning years. It seems each time I see it I like it more. Now I think its one of the best Swedish thrillers at least of the ones I have seen. A really gripping movie about criminal underworld themes of social status gripping characters and thrilling events. This is a brutal film not just in the action but also the plot. It feels very realistic even if I dont really know anything about the stuff. The author of the book has personal experience of the world he writes about. The acting is very good. Excellent casting choices. Not only in their performances but they really feel believable in this world. Joel Kinnaman is pretty much as I imagined JW and Matias Varela it totally believable. The actor which makes the best performance is Dragomir Mrsic his performance is great and his is the most gripping character. The action is among the best in a Swedish movie. Visually great with suspense at the highest. Brutal and tense without overdoing it. Not wanting to bad mouth Swedish movies but the production is really on top. I think that even if you are not familiar with the book you will have little problem in following the plot. The pace is fast but not too much. It still gives time to give us understanding of the characters. Which is totally necessary as the characters are just as interesting as the events they are in maybe even more so.Snabba Cash is a brutal realistic tense and gripping. They have done a movie that I think does the book justice but also works very well as a movie on its own.".

Judging from the other reviews apparently some people like it.I however did not like this movie much at all.. Firstly the film makes the colossal mistake of trying to appear realistic whilst blatantly not being. Other reviewers have attacked the plot as being the main issue in terms of lack of realism or the stereotyped portrayal of the various ethnic groups that are shown in the film. These issues aren't really what make this film so wholly unbelievable though. University student gets involved with a bunch of drugrunning gangsters... Sure it is perhaps a bit improbable but stranger things have happened... And yes the stereotyping is irritating but there's nothing particularly implausible about it. No. The thing that makes this so flaming unrealistic is that there is barely a glimmer of humor. The characters are uniformly miserable. There's almost zero jesting. There's no monkeying around. It's just gloom gloom gloom all the way through. Okay guys we get it if you get involved with gangsters your life will become utterly miserable... The only thing I'm unsure about is whether the writer and director are actually living in such a wellinsulated middleclass bubble that in spite of having presumably done some research on the topic they still think that this is what life is like for those involved in the criminal underworld.Now don't get me wrong I'm not insistent on realism in my gangster flicks. I love Tarantino which has tendencies to be even more unrealistic though in a totally different manner... The problem here is that the film doesn't really have anything to make up for all this miserable sermonizing. I like the visual style... but none of the male characters really grab you. Actually by far my favorite character was the loveinterest Sophie... And I don't think this was entirely a question of her being far more enjoyable to look at... there was a sense of realism to her character and roundedness which the others lacked. Perhaps it's just that the director gave her the freedom to smile occasionally! However her role is pretty incidental to the plot and she doesn't get all that much screen time so in the end we're mainly just left with a bunch of miserable blokes for the two hour slog...".

The film rotates between the three characters but you can't help but feel cheated due to the incompleteness of their backstories. They do succeed in humanizing the three to some degree.

Likewise Jorge vows to care for his family once the big drug deal is completed.Espinosa directs a suspenseful film that doesn't solely depend on action sequences to entertain. Kinnaman gives a charming performance as JW. Varela and Mrsic both give noteworthy performances. By far JW is the most complex of the characters. At first glance it seems he is motivated by money but it becomes clear that a sense of belonging is also a factor. His growing friendship with Jorge begins to impact his decisions and his relationship with Sophie. In fact the bond of friendship plays a big part in the films questionable ending. However it again appears the character development between the two lacked the necessary foundation as the outcome attempts to support.

From outer side the movie may looks like an action bonanza but from inner side its emotionally connected thriller which takes us into the lives of criminals or just I say criminal minded. Based upon the bestselling book the movie is refreshing and amalgamation of emotional drama and thrilling violence is just perfect. On one side it shows how far a man can go to be rich so he can be part of the wealthy society of Stockholm and on the other side how far a man can go to protect his child from his criminal life. Joel Kinnaman has emerged as superstar he literally owns the movie. Stylish chic and poorrich seriously this man does everything greatly. Watching this after The Killing and cameo in Safe House makes me admire his potential and there is no doubt his future is bright. Lisa Henni is gorgeous. Dragomir Mrsic is great as protective father and the criminal. All the other supporting cast is fantastic. Overall Snabba Cash is really entertaining thriller and now I cannot wait to see Snabba Cash2.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Book of Timothy teaches us that money is the root of all evil. Easy Money tells the story of three men who do evil things in the pursuit of money. Two a Chilean prison escapee and a Serbian hitman have convinced themselves that it's all for the benefit of someone they love. The third a Swedish economics student posing as a rich playboy has no one to be selfless for and therefore doesn't delude himself into believing his is a noble cause. Although he understands the banking system and is a numbers whiz he isn't smart enough to consider the consequences of his actions which affect not only him but the people in his life. If only he had seen past his need to be someone he isn't perhaps then he wouldn't have been so easily lured into the dangerous world of organized crime.Adapted from the novel by Jens Lapidus the film was established as a critical and commercial success in its native Sweden back in January of 2010 and the first of two sequels is set to be released in that part of the world sometime this year. Will this first chapter fare as well here in the U.S. given the fact that importing Scandinavian crime thrillers has become fashionable? There's no way for me to answer that question. You should keep in mind though that Warner Bros. has already acquired the rights for an American remake and Zac Efron is set to star in and produce it clearly somebody out there thinks it's a pretty good film. All I know is that I found it to be quite engaging. I admit that it had more to do with the characters than with the plot which is not only convoluted but also has a tendency to meander.The central character is Johan Westlund who goes by the nickname JW Joel Kinnaman. He comes from the northern Norrland region of Sweden which has consistently been portrayed in a lessthanfavorable light in Scandinavian fiction most prominently in Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. He was raised by workingclass parents one of whom is an alcoholic. His sister has been missing for four years although he continues to hope that she's still alive. He currently attends the Stockholm School of Economics all the while keeping his past hidden and convincing his rich circle of friends that he's actually one of them. He funds his lifestyle as best he can by illegally taxiing the wealthy patrons that frequent the highend public square of Stureplan. After meeting an upperclass young woman named Sophie Lisa Henni he's enticed by his boss Abdulkarim Mahmut Suvakci to enter the drug trade and earn some serious money.As this is being established we meet Jorge Salinas Barrio Matias Padin Varela who opens the film by escaping from prison rather easily I thought but never mind. An expert in the drug trade his plan is twofold 1 To have his revenge on the man who turned him over to the police a Yugoslavian mob boss named Radovan Kranjic Dejan uki and 2 to make one final cocaine delivery before leaving the country for good. His alters his plans somewhat when he reunites with his sister Paola Annika Ryberg Whittembury and discovers that she's pregnant. We're tempted to believe that the unborn baby is his one shot at redemption especially when he states that he can help provide it with the kind of childhood he and Paola never had. Maybe he's being sincere and maybe he isn't. All that matters is that his promises are hopelessly entwined with a profession that's dangerous and immoral.We also meet Mrado Slovovic Dragomir Mrsic a hitman who works for Radovan and has been hired to take care of Jorge. Quite suddenly he gains custody of his eightyearold daughter Lovisa Lea Stojanov whose drugaddicted mother is no longer able to care for her. Although initially bothered by his new situation he quickly grows attached to Lovisa and promises to right by her  or at the very least do better than his father did for him which wasn't much. It's summed up with his account of a childhood beating so severe he peed blood for three days straight. As was the case with Jorge his good intentions are overshadowed by his unsavory affiliations. Giving his daughter a better life isn't simply a matter of earning money and somehow buying her protection he should never have gotten involved with the mafia in the first place.Abdulkarim needs JW's social connections and financial skills to purchase a floundering smallinvestment bank which can then be used to launder money for a cocaine syndicate. This is where Jorge comes in his knowledge of cocaine will be invaluable for expanding Abdulkarim's business. As for Mrado he eventually convinces JW that in this business friends are liable to stab you in the back. In other words JW shouldn't get his hopes up that he will get the money he was promised in a timely manner. All leads to a shootout in a conveniently deserted warehouse and in all honesty I expected nothing less. Although the plot and ultimate message of Easy Money aren't especially original I appreciated the character development the performances and the suspense. Here's hoping that at least that much is retained for the Englishlanguage reboot. Chris Pandolfi www.atatheaternearyou.net".

The plot was very good even though I struggled a bit with the foreign dialogue and who was who. They needed to give JW more depth with either a hell of a lot more lines or some monologue or narration since he was often just standing there with blank looks. I also wanted more of Sophie that interaction was pretty thin.".

Daniel Espinosa's film 'Easy Money' is a serviceable thriller welldone in itself but not especially original. A social climbing business student sees an opportunity to offer his services to a drug smuggling gang but soon finds that being a money launderer is not quite as simple as he'd hoped. Some details of the plot make less than perfect sense take over a private bank and gain access to equity worth 30 times what you pay for it is a plan that surely needs more explanation. What's good about the drama is that it shows the gang war from multiple sides the characters may be rotten but they're still all human and each with their own mixed motives for the bad things they do.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is the proof that in some though rare occasions the film adaptation of a book is better than the novel itself. ''Snabba Cash'' is based on the trilogy of crime novels written by one of the most successful criminal defense attorneys in today's Stockholm Jens Lapidus so there are two more films Snabba Cash 2''Hard To Kill'' and Snabba Cash 3''Life Deluxe''. The writer's invaluable professional experiences and communication with real criminals benefit the realism element in the book and is reflected both in the wonderful descriptions of Stockholm's ugly side as well as the ''natural'' dialogues. As far as the film is concerned I believe that the first one is the best of the three directed by Daniel Espinoza ''Den frdmde'' ''Child 44'' and starring a wonderful cast with Joel Kinnaman JW Dragomir ''Gago'' Mrsic Mrado and Cristian Varela Jorge as the three main protagonists. The movie is a penetrative look at Stockholm's underbelly nowadays following the lives of JW a young lad from Sweden's countryside who uses his bright mind in order to invade Stockholm's aristocrats' social circle Mrado who is a Serbian mafioso and enforcer with a little daughter and finally Jorge a Latin immigrant who manages to escape from prison and frantically search an effective way in order to make easy money. The lives of those three intersect and a wellcrafted plot which remains faithful to the book is beginning to unfold in front of the reader's eyes. This is a fastpaced film with some action and really great characters Mrado is more than convincing as the Yugoslavian thug causing pain and disaster as Dragomir Mrsic who was himself a bank robber arrested at 1990 and sentenced to three and a half years of incarceration in Hall prison delivers a totally brilliant performance which shows that the Bosnia and Herzegovina born actor has a lot of potentials. His acting is one of the many highlights of the film while both Kinnaman and Varela deliver more than satisfying performances of their roles. I would also like to mention Dejan Cukic who is terrific in a rather brief appearance incarnating the Serbian mob boss Radovan.''Snabba Cash'' is a fasttempo modernday film which proves that Europeans can produce great films of the crime genre. This is an absolute mustsee for all crime fiction addicts.".

	schema:reviewBody "Waste of time 110 Author Mats from United Kingdom 4 December 2012 This review may contain spoilers Film starts out pretty good. There is sharp tension between the ethnic Swedes and the immigrant communities. Interesting material I thought. The movie depict well how extended families are important for the southern European gangsters and how that safety is not available to the ethnic Swedes. After having started great after one hour the movie starts to sag. It turns into some kind of traditional politically correct production. It is as if the director had second thoughts. After having shown the immigrants to be pretty pathetic individuals the director feels an urge to show that they are human beings after all. This is done by having the foreign gangsters have little girls and buy dolls and baby clothing. So pathetic. By now the film is really not worth watching. The story of the ethnic Swede studying economics and then just going into heavy crime is just not believable. I started out out thinking that this is a 7 movie after 15 minutes but then my verdict gradually went down all the way to 1. This is just a waste of time.This movie has very little to do with ethnicity rather it has to do with class I'd say.

He strives and shares the same goals and beliefs with his gangster friends for a life in de luxe by making easy money  in despite of different ethnical backgrounds which the movie shows plays a very little role when money talks and when even the people within the Serbian mafia don't't trust each other and stab each other's backs. JW and his gangster friends have more in common in their respective working class backgrounds and that they want to change their lives and give it a meaning and to become something they're not than they have with their own people sharing their ethnical backrounds respectively. That's also what's so great about this movie! It makes you think about how similar class conditions and life backgrounds can have a larger impact on you than you could ever imagine.".

	onyx:emotionText "Waste of time 110 Author Mats from United Kingdom 4 December 2012 This review may contain spoilers Film starts out pretty good. There is sharp tension between the ethnic Swedes and the immigrant communities. Interesting material I thought. The movie depict well how extended families are important for the southern European gangsters and how that safety is not available to the ethnic Swedes. After having started great after one hour the movie starts to sag. It turns into some kind of traditional politically correct production. It is as if the director had second thoughts. After having shown the immigrants to be pretty pathetic individuals the director feels an urge to show that they are human beings after all. This is done by having the foreign gangsters have little girls and buy dolls and baby clothing. So pathetic. By now the film is really not worth watching. The story of the ethnic Swede studying economics and then just going into heavy crime is just not believable. I started out out thinking that this is a 7 movie after 15 minutes but then my verdict gradually went down all the way to 1. This is just a waste of time.This movie has very little to do with ethnicity rather it has to do with class I'd say. Every criminal extended family has a natural protective side against outsiders regardless of which ethnical group the outsiders belong to and regardless if the family consists of Arabs Swedes Serbs or is a mix of everything or is called Hells Angels or Bandidos. You don't even have to belong to a criminal family for that matter as even upper class people are very protective against outsiders that they don't consider worthy.

	schema:reviewBody "To those who can remember that far this movie has close kinship or is even a nonidentical twin to The Inn of six Happiness where Ingrid Bergman portrayed Gladys Aylward an English woman who escaped with 100 Chinese children from the invading Japanese. Escape from Huang Shi or The children of Huang Shi is almost identical in many ways the story of English reporter George Hogg who took 60 Chinese children on a mini long March along the Silk Road to safety before the Japaneses' onslaught hit the orphanage. There is a little more detail in this story prior to Hogg getting to the orphanage where he won the heart of the children embittered from witnessing atrocities unspeakable done to their loved ones. But the relationship between Hogg and these children is the heart of the story. Most remarkable is what we see during the end credit roll where some of these children now well advanced in age recounting how they remember him  the most touching part of the movie.This is not to say that the dramatization in the movie is not well done. Here the credit goes first and foremost to the cast. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Radha Mitchell are two of the most notable actors today not because of their looks which they certainly have but because they are good character actors. Meyers is great in his portrayal of Hogg as a mildtempered young man from a sworn Pacifist family finding himself challenged by the emotion of hate triggered by some of the things he witnessed. Mitchell is wonderful as nurse Lee Pearson who seems at first hardened and drained of any emotions after all the atrocities she has seen but later found to have a weak spot of her own.Chow Yunfat plays Jack Chen a seasoned military man who saves Hogg from decapitation under a Japanese sword and goes on to help him all along the way. This character is portrayed with a dry sense of humour uncharacteristic of the Chinese people at the time. This is a good approach as it balances somewhat the story that is essentially heavily tragic. Chow handles the role with customary ease making his character very likable. Michelle Yeoh plays Mrs Wang a successful pragmatic merchant who although taking pains to hide it also has a caring heart. Yeoh has everything it takes to bring out the dignity and charm that prompted Hogg to refer to her as a great lady when he said goodbye upon taking on the march.This AustraliaChinaGermany collaboration steers a careful course of political correctness in the sensitive issue of the delicate relationship between the Chinese Nationalist and Communists during the Japanese invasion. The depiction of Japanese atrocities of course need not be spared unless one wants to falsify history but even here there is only very brief mention of historical details. The main focus of this movie is a human story well worth telling as the interviews of the actual survivors shown with the end credits clearly underscore.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie last Saturday and here are some feelings of mine. The children of Huangshi brought me an vivid image of the reality during the preWW. George Hogg also known as Heke was a courageous insistent and responsible man. He treated the homeless orphans as ordinary innocent children while the Japanese enemy and the nationalists never showed any mercy to them. Children were victims of the wars. They lost their families their childhood and even their courage to live. Wars also raised the hatred in their mind changing them into devils. In the movie two echo scenes impressed me a lot One is the photo of Shikai' family the other is a photo of a Japanese soldier. Shikai saw his parents and his sister be killed atrociously by Japanese and since then he became dissociable and unreasonable and the only hope to him was the photo. When he got the chance to kill Japanese he did it decidedly only to find that a family photo holding in the soldier's hands. Heke tried to release the children's hatred and he wanted them to be normal children. At some aspect he succeeded because the children of Huangshi e.g. Laosi found his way back to be a happy child under Heke's education however the damage of the war was too huge to be cured. Most of the children were saved but not what they were used to be any more. Anyway Heke is a great man. Although he is a foreigner he is our national hero forever.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE CHILDREN OF HUANG SHI is a long greater than two hours epic tale that happens to be a true story of an extraordinary hero's life and gift to humanity during World War II. If as a film the telling of this story is a bit shaky in spots it is probably due to the episodic series of events that happened very quickly and under existing conditions of profound stress. Yet despite the occasional misfires in production this remains a bit of history we all should know. George Hogg Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a journalist assigned to Shanghai in 1937 and with his colleagues he plans to explore the extent of the invasion of China by the Japanese. Under the guise of Red Cross workers his small band manages to enter Nanjing where now alone due to the loss of his friends to battle he observes and photographs the atrocities of mass murders of the people of Nanjing. He is captured by the Japanese tortured when his confiscated camera reveals his terrifying photographs and it is only by acts of fortune and the aid of a Chinese Nationalist Chen Hansheng Chow YunFat that he escapes. Hogg probes the Chinese countryside for further evidences of the evil of the Japanese invasion and he finds a village of children adults are all absent and realizes that he is in an orphanage without a leader. At first reluctant to assume the role of guardian of these impoverished and filthy frightened children he soon accepts his responsibility and is challenged by an Australian nurse Lee Pearson Radha Mitchell to become not only the caretaker but also the fatherteacherproviderrole model these children so desperately need. Seeing the advancing of the Japanese Hogg decides to take his wards 700 mile away to a small village by the Gobi desert reachable only by the infamous Silk Road. It is this journey and the way both the children and Hogg are affected by the challenge that absorb the greater part of the film. Observing the transformation of George Hogg's view of the world is made credible by Jonathan Rhys Meyers' performance. The cast of children often steals the limelight but with supporting cast members such as Chow YunFat Radha Mitchell and Michelle Yeoh as an opium merchant the story never lacks color and character. The look of the film is dark but the message of this story is full of light. Here is a bit of Chinese history we should all know! Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "Gripping and intense film depicting terrible deeds during Japonese invasion in Shangai and Nanjing 1937 . After that at the city take place violations mutilations and massacres. Some prisoners are interred in a prison camp but later they are led to fire squad scaffold and alive burying. Later on  an orphaned children group escapes led by the journalist named George Hogg Jonathan Rhys Meyers a nurse Radha Mitchell and a communist Chinese Choe Yun Fat.Director deglamorizes war showing true horror and terrible events . It's a staggering evocation of the Chinese Holocausto in Nanjing  as the atrocities are depicted matter of factly as byproduct of sheer Japanese evil. The opening twenty minutes in which the reporter appears as hidden observer turns out to be a graphic depiction the facing off is  on its own and is magnificent . As the exciting beginning results to be pretty stirring  the developing of the movie regarding invasion China is partially similar to Empire of the sun and suffering of the children on the escape is really moving . The starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers and the rest of the cast are excellent  as the movie is powered by splendid performances in charge of American and Chinese actors who during filming suffered some inevitable pains for the hard environment . Filmed in perfect color by cameraman Zhao  reflecting appropriately the Chinese scenarios .

Some prisoners are interred in a prison camp but later they are led to fire squad scaffold and alive burying. Later on  an orphaned children group escapes led by the journalist named George Hogg Jonathan Rhys Meyers a nurse Radha Mitchell and a communist Chinese Choe Yun Fat.Director deglamorizes war showing true horror and terrible events . It's a staggering evocation of the Chinese Holocausto in Nanjing  as the atrocities are depicted matter of factly as byproduct of sheer Japanese evil. The opening twenty minutes in which the reporter appears as hidden observer turns out to be a graphic depiction the facing off is  on its own and is magnificent . As the exciting beginning results to be pretty stirring  the developing of the movie regarding invasion China is partially similar to Empire of the sun and suffering of the children on the escape is really moving . The starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers and the rest of the cast are excellent  as the movie is powered by splendid performances in charge of American and Chinese actors who during filming suffered some inevitable pains for the hard environment . Filmed in perfect color by cameraman Zhao  reflecting appropriately the Chinese scenarios . Spottiswoode makes a breathtaking work which directs spectacularly with groundbreaking scenes in a heartbreaking context .

I am used to see that kind of hypocrisy on Hollywood films an example which comes to my mind at the moment is The Last Samurai but it is obvious that also international productions like this one are not free of falling on that temptation.However in spite of not having left me very satisfied I think The Children of Huan Shi deserves a slight recommendation because it is not boring the performances are decent and the direction is good.If I had to summarize this film I would say it is not bad but it is mediocre and I feel it could have been better.".

Again the power of this story is unmistakable but it is certainly not given its due by this rendition.

	schema:reviewBody "Last year wifey won some tickets to see this at the cinema. We never got round to it but on the weekend it was wifey's choice of movie being her birthday and all and she picked this.Children Of The Silk Road is based upon the remarkable true story of journalist George Hogg played by the annoying Jonathan Rhys Meyers in his finest work since Bend It Like Beckham a Brit who during the 30's found himself in China looking for untold stories and ended up being the saviour to a heap of young orphan boys.Hogg bravely chose to go to China in the 30's to try to tell the world about the atrocities being committed by the Japanese soldiers on innocent civilians. He gets caught by the Japanese early on into his trip and is about to be murdered when he saved by a small band of Chinese fighters headed by Chen Chow YunFat in his finest work since Ban wo chuang tian ya. Chen helps him on his way where he eventually comes across an orphanage in an abandoned grand building. Here he meets up again with US nurse Lee played by Radha Mitchell in her best work since some guest appearances on Aussie sitcom favourite All Together Now. She challenges George to stay and help these abandoned boys rather than just run back home like a little nancy boy. George stays and ends up dramatically changing the boys lives. Word soon reaches him though that the Japanese will be coming so he must take them on a seemingly crazy 700mile journey through the rough Chinese winter to refuge. Will they survive and reach freedom? See it to find out.Not bad and certainly inspiring in pieces. Meyers pulled it off reasonably well considering how unappealing he is to men in general if not for a few scenes that were uncomfortably awkward. One of the better movies set in China I've seen perhaps even better than Rush Hour.".

However this is actually Jonathan Rhys Meyers' vehicle as he plays the central character of George Hogg an Associated Press reporter who smuggles himself into Nanjing preWWII and witnessed the atrocities of the invading Japanese army. Inspired by a true story this is about the life of Hogg as he takes it upon himself to do whatever he can to save a group of orphans he gets set up and acquainted with.What of Chow? His Chen Hansheng a communist fighting against the Japanese gets relegated to supporting appearances to give us some brief history lessons on the uneasy alliance between the communists and Chiang Kaishek's Nationalists as they only link up with each other to fight a common enemy when it conveniences both parties. You would come to think that from the trailers this is gonna be quite an action packed movie with Chow leading his group of merry men to do battle against the Japanese but the movie employs a fight another day stance and the central plot has nothing to do with that too.And pairing up in the same movie after their Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon stint is Michelle Yeoh only this time they don't get to share any scene together and worse Yeoh's role as a rich merchant Mrs Wang gets severely diminished. No doubt it is clear that the prospects of uniting Chow and Yeoh together would bring in curious crowds who can't wait to savour the opportune moment but alas they happen to be just the side dishes.Jonathan Rhys Meyers joined by Radha Mitchell fresh from her battle with a beastly crocodile takes on leading man status as the reporter who finds himself thrusts into Huang Shi and into the enclave of 60 male orphans living in filth and without hope. Strongly encouraged to stay behind and take care of them he becomes the reluctant and unwilling teacher but slowly wins over the hearts and trust of the children and hence begins a fairy tale like environment that seemingly is remotely away from the war in China except for the enemy planes flying overhead serving as a reminder.However it's soon that they find themselves between a rock and a hard place with the Japanese inching closer and the Nationalists wanting to possess their land for their use as well as to conscript those boys into warfare. Not wanting that to happen Hogg packs them all up and so begins the journey proper as per what the title says.The events that unfold are just plain sailing without any tension involved nor any excitement built up. It just flatlines its way through beautiful environments of mountains and plains coupled with treacherous snows and sandstorms but otherwise it seemed that their 1000km trek looked quite peanuts. What's more amusing here though is how the Chinese cast look so much more comfortable speaking English  I thought Chow has improved by leaps and bounds but Meyers and Mitchell really sounded very off in their Mandarin diction that you'll find it quite ridiculous that the parties they speak to can understand them totally. Brownie points have to be given for their courage to speak and give the language a go though again it could be playing to character as one cannot master the language in such a short period of time.At the end of the day this played out more like a simple account of an event that had happened of course again with artistic license taken and the documentarystyled interview segments at the end while the end credits play affirmed what happened and gave us some insights into Hogg's character much more that what the film had portrayed. While the alternate title might seem to involve the Children quite a bit only a few were given names and faces and even fewer given personalities. Similar to movies like Schindler's List and Hotel Rwanda where the ability of one man helped save many but this one lacked that crucial emotional punch.".

The story of George Hogg and Rewi Alley a communist from New Zealand who saved 60 orphans from the ravages of the Second World War by taking them on a 1100 km trek across mountainous terrain is truly inspirational. Why Alley the true leader of the expedition had to be replaced by an American nurse with a drug problem is anybody's guess. Probably to add romantic interest to the story because just about the only thing the film makers deem interesting enough during the epic journey across the mountains is the fact the leading man and lady finally hit the sack together. When will they ever learn? Trying to sell this as a 'true' should be punishable by a fine which matches the eventual profits DVD sales included. Other reviewers have remarked how little attention the actual children get in a movie that is called Children of Huang Shi so I won't go into that. All in all 3 stars for the often stunning photography.".

There also have been a few about a dedicated person helping children escaping from wars horrors. So what makes this film so much better.First this was made in China in actual locations. The scenery is breathtaking.It is based on a real person Charles Hogg a journalist in his 20'swho reluctantly became head of a school of orphanswho with the help of a young nurse leads these young children 700 miles across China to a safer area.There was a similar film many years ago with Ingrid Bergman Inn of the Sixth Happinness which in itself was an excellent movie.Jonathan RhyssMeyer who is under 30 is Hogg  fits the role perfectly. Radha Mitchell is the Aunstralian nurse she has a difficult role to play she does have personal problems.She too fits here role perfectly.Ynn Fat Chow AKA Chow Yun Fatis a soldier  Hogg's friend. This fine actor has yet to give a bad performance. Michelle Yeoh also has a major role  is greatIn fact all the acting  all the production values are first rate.This film is based on factI cannot  will not say how accurate it is. I only know I felt watching it I saw a wonderful well made film.As one would expect there are some clichs Very few if any films escape from having themIt was excellently directed by Roger Spottiswoode. It did have a theatrical run in the USA playing in small handful of theatres.WHY OH WHY do they do this is beyond me. Granted there are few exciting action packed scenes this is NOT that type of film.. Ratings  out of 4 98 points out of 100 IMDb 10 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "OK so this story is based on true events I can see why someone would like this story to be told. But why didn't they work with good writers this story is cut in little pieces clich upon clich and then tight together to make one piece out of it. The actors really don't know what to do with the lines they get and the director really didn't know what he wanted to tell. Is this a herostory? Is this a lovestory? Is this a historic adventure? Is this a warstory? I give one example in the beginning of the story the loveinterest Mitchell is talking to the hero Meyers about how important it is that she is around being a nurse and knows that one scratch can lead to an infection and to death. So she tells that she cleans the wounds and tells the patient how important it is to do this as quick as possible even if 'it's just a scratch'. Later on in the movie Meyers cuts himself when he's working on replacing a tire and tells Mitchell 'it's just a scratch'. And she SMILES at him.What the f?!! Wasn't she supposed to clean this wound as she told all those people she nursed in the war to do so they wouldn't die? Guess what happens to Meyers... And actually it's her fault I yelled at the screen annoyed.and please don't even mention the monologues the actors get to work with during the movie. Even a first year scriptwriters school student would do better in writing them. So clich and predictable. I pity the actors  they must have read the script before they said yes. Why did they accept such bad writing? They probably needed the money. The sceneries are beautiful Michelle Yeoh has the best part and is the only actor that I believed. maybe because she didn't have that many lines?. I'm afraid those are the only things that worked out well. The story is fabricated and doesn't have a nice flow the actors really have difficulties working the lines they get from the writers and clearly the director didn't know what he wanted to do with this story.If it wasn't for the beautiful settings and the fact that you could sense there was somewhere a story worth telling it would have been a total waste of time watching this movie. Well it definitely was a waste of money making it I would read the book if I were you.".

It is hard to feel the individual character changes because it all happens so fast. Of course I couldn't expect a two hour movie to slowly tell a story that spanned many months in real life but still. You can't show two friends entering China then one dying and completely omit him from the story from then on because you don't have time. On the other hand I hardly see the subject as appropriate for a mini series.Bottom line good story good acting watch it if you feel the need for a good war time drama that inspires.".

The Japanese took control of Shanghai and then went on to Nanjing all as part of a single campaign. Not many reporters tried to rush into Nanjing. In fact many could not get out which was why they could report what happened. Why was Meyers' acting in the initial scenes so bad? Why would someone Fisher I think his name was go boxing and let others punch him in the face repeatedly a few days before his own wedding? Why was the one scene of the massacre done so badly that it failed to evoke any emotion? Why was the beheading contest by the Japanese reported as The Hundred Beheadings in the Japanese newspapers in Nanjing not mentioned at all? Why were the Communists in Nanjing? The city was a Nationalist stronghold and the Communist had no military presence in town before during and after the massacre. Communist attacks on the Japanese army during WW2 few and far between as they were took place largely in the countryside. The Communists were busy expanding their bases of support with the farmers and peasants. They were conserving their strengths and letting the Nationalists i.e. someone else who happens to be their mortal enemies do most of the fighting. Why were they growing sunflowers when everyone was short of food? Why did they have fuel to run the generator? Why do the uniforms of the Nationalist army look exactly like those of the Japanese Imperial Army? The Nationalist army uniforms were gray. Why would the caravan encounter Japanese army personnel going the other way near Lanzhou? The Japanese only wished they got that far inland. Why would Chen Chow Yun Fat waste three bullets to salute Shi Kai and risk attracting attention? These are Chinese people not westerners. Why did the film title really mean Escape from Huangshi and from the Nationalist for fear of conscription? Why did the uniforms of the police in Lanzhou look just like those of the police in Shanghai? Shanghai police's uniforms were unique. The writers probably assumed police uniforms in China in the 1930's were like those in USAOz today the same across the country. Why would the officials in a poor town like Lanzhou just give away not lend but give away four trucks which must be valuable assets of the local government? Why did none of the livestock get eaten throughout the whole journey? As some guy near me commented out loud Why was Chow Yun Fat just walking around and dropping in on the children once in a while? Why was Chow Yun Fat free to roam all the way over in Lanzhou when all the fighting was in central and eastern China? Why did none of the kids have any personality? They might as well have been cut out of cardboards. But maybe the writers got it right by accidence since Chinese kids are mostly compliant like this. Why was this in the end just another film about two westerners with China largely the backdrop? Why was this film directed so badly that I felt nothing for any of the main characters at all? Why would anyone allow scriptwriters who don't really know Chinese history or the Chinese frame of mind to write a script and waste money like this?".

As it stands now its a good but rather standard film about a man who tried to do something in the face of war. The film stars Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Hogg. He's fine but I don't think he's given much to do since much of the action seems to be reduced to clich even the romance with the broken Australian nurse has the feeling of been there. Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yoeh have small but important roles respectively as a general who befriends Hogg and a black marketeer who helps him. I liked it but didn't love it its one of those films thats almost.. but isn't and falls between the cracks. Perhaps because of the possibly bad subtitles or more likely the clichd script the under appreciated Roger Spottiswoode used just isn't great. This isn't to say there aren't a couple of great set pieces there are the attack on the train in particular but its not enough to raise the film from the near great to the great or from nearly very good to very good. It just sort of misses. The just sort of misses feeling was reenforced after I read some pieces on line which gives more details on the real George Hogg He needs a miniseries about his life not two hour film 6ish out of 10".

Both men find themselves in this foreign land on a mission to substantiate reports about a massacre. When George finds himself separated from his colleague he witnesses a group of Chinese men and women being gunned down mass execution style. Although The Children of Huang Shi doesn't whitewash the violence that went down in Nanking the filmmaker does temper the killing to a degree in which ethnic cleansing never becomes the subject of the film. If you're expecting an adaptation of Iris Chang's The Rape of Nanking you'll be sorely disappointed. When our story begins the massacre is over and done with. Since The Children of Huang Shi withholds from its audience the number of Chinese people involved in the slaughter this enables the filmmaker to portray the Japanese as rational people.In one scene George convinces an army general to call off his troops from searching for weapons at a random checkpoint. The filmmaker wants us to believe that the Japanese official would care about his soldiers contaminating the sterilized medical supplies meant for the sick and injured Chinese people. This show of clemency is downright laughable. In The Rape of Nanking Chang details instances in which women's babies were ripped out of their wombs young girls being raped while the city was reduced to rubble and its people literally chopped into pieces. Later in the film a Japanese soldier discovers the hat of a comrade placed on the head of a Chinese boy. George explains that the orphan found the hat on the ground during their sojourn. Even worse one of the older boys points his gun at the Japanese contingent. Incredibly an exchange of gunfire is averted even though the historical record shows that the Japanese soldier had no qualms about aiming their guns at children.But let's be fair. Along with the HBO documentary Nanking the story of Japan's war crimes are finally being told to a western audience. It's about time. Although the orphans don't get enough credit for their own survival George Hogg is deserving of the accolades that his selfevident heroism brought him. But just in case the audience fails to recognize what this man accomplished Mrs. Wang an opium dealer tells George how wonderful he is. LeeRadha Mitchell seconds that emotion. She had her doubts when the nurse assigned George to the orphanage. And then there's the reallife survivors who offer their testimony about his greatness during the closing credits.The film never proves that the Japanese are savages but Lee was in Nanking during the siege. If the audience knew about the nature of the attack Lee's disproportionate anger over George's redecorating efforts on her living quarters which inspires the nurse to storm out of the orphanage would make this British woman completely insufferable.The less you know about The Rape of Nanking the better.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a good film struggling to get out of the heroic story of George Hogg. Unfortunately this isn't it. My son saw the words 'sweeping historical drama' on the DVD sleeve and headed for the door. It's the kiss of death for a film he said The word sweeping...... Out of the mouths of babes......I'm not sure what it is about these international productions financed by several countries but they never quite seem to work and they especially don't seem to work when the product is some kind of biopic. This seems to be a type of production much loved by the Australian film industry and as far as I can see The Children of Huang Shi was made with money from Germany China and Australia. Certainly this is a good story and when the movie gets away from the badly lit set and into the countryside it's photogenic and pretty to watch yet somehow it's all a bit dull. I strongly suspect that the need to keep several nations happy leads to a smoothing out of script disagreements which leaves a rather anodyne finished product.The story which is basically true  if tweaked a fair amount  concerns George Hogg a young English Oxford graduate who arrived in China in the years leading up to WW2 to work as a stringer for the Associated Press and landed himself in the middle of the Japanese occupation. He managed to get into Nanjing where after witnessing appalling atrocities he was captured by the Japanese narrowly avoided a beheading and after being injured traveled up country to Huang Shi to recuperate. There he found himself in charge of an orphanage for boys. The boys had been abandoned by adults and were living a Lord of the Flies type existence. Most had witnessed terrible scenes themselves with family killed in front of them bombings massacres and near starvation. Initially unwilling Hogg was persuaded by a Red Cross nurse Lee Pearson to stay and assist them. He built the orphanage into a strong community based on his pacifist principles but finding that they were stuck between the advancing Japanese and the Chinese Nationalist and Communist forces  who wanted to recruit his charges as soldiers  he took his boys on a long trek over the mountains to China's remote and harsh interior where they would be safe. It's an interesting story but the dialog is often leaden  even by the standards of the 1930s  and sometimes sounds as if it was written by a committee none of whose members had English as a first language. It's very hard to get away with lines like My mother had Ghandi to tea. Given the natural drama of the true story I'm not certain why it's quite so disappointing but one reason has to be the casting. Jonathan Rhys Meyers just doesn't have the gravitas to pull off the role of Hogg. I know it's not his fault but he reminds me too much of Rik Mayall in The Young Ones a British TV comedy series from the 1980s. I never believed in his Hogg never felt he was a strong enough or tough enough character to carry off the things that Hogg did. Rhys Meyers doesn't have the charisma to carry the movie but Hogg is the central character and if he is not convincing none of the rest can work either. I actually liked Rhys Meyers in Match Point a few years back but this is too much of a stretch for him he is wildly miscast here. He looks petulant and sulky and never fully rises to the occasion. Also rather miscast is Radha Mitchell as the American Nurse Pearson. And this is where I'm puzzled. Brief investigation of the actual facts reveals that the nurse who aided Hogg was a New Zealander not American. I assume her nationality has been changed to make the movie appeal to an American audience? So why cast an Australian in the role who is little known here in the USA? Mitchell was very effective in Finding Neverland where Johnny Depp carried the movie but her performance here is monotone. There is no real heat generated between Hogg and Pearson despite the attempt to inject a love story. It felt false and an appeasement to the audience.Also surprisingly bad is YunFat Chow as the communist leader. David Wenham puts in a brief appearance but is killed off early. I assume he's there to appeal to the Australian audience but he's around for far too short a time to be effective. However Michelle Yeoh is stand out as Mrs Wang a local trader who assists Hogg and I actually thought the kids all pretty good and rather appealing despite other IMDb reviewers thinking otherwise. They tackle their parts with honesty. It felt as if the casting had been done to appeal broadly to all the nationalities who put up the money but if the actors don't fit the parts that cannot work. The whole production has a stilted feel. It's not actively bad but it's nowhere near as good as the story demands. I'd like to see it remade with a really strong actor as Hogg and a more nuanced interpretation of Pearson and if the love story must be in there then some genuine passion between the two leads. Disappointing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Children of Hueng Shi 2008 12Quick ReviewCaught this one a little while ago. I was a bit disappointed though i wasn't really expecting too much I suppose to begin with. The story follows the true adventures of British journalist George Hogg during WWII in China who witnessed atrocities at the hands of Imperial Japan. Hogg eventually ends up at a school where he reluctantly of course becomes attached to the children. Hogg played by Jonathan RhysMeyers along with the help of an Austrailian Nurse Mitchell and a Chinese Communist YunFat leads sixty children on a thousand mile journey across China's mountains to safety away from invading Japanese forces. The technical quality of the filmmaking is solid  as is to be expected from Spottiswoode. However it also carries the usual Spottiswoode flaws  namely more expositional dialogue than you can shake a stick at and convenient contrivances throughout. I enjoyed Spottiswoode's previous film the far superior Shake Hands with the Devil which itself it not without his usual faults but I just couldn't get into this one. The dialogue is too heavy handed and half of it is dedicated to delivering a history lesson. Spottiswoode's desire to inform is certainly admirable and the story and the background history certainly are worthy of telling. Nevertheless attempting to deliver both in depth is a recipe for failure. The acting is for the most part fine YunFat delivers a fine performance as does RhysMeyers who I think someday will likely deliver an amazing rendering of a psychopath the eyes!. Overall I can't quite recommend it and my review may be slightly off as I don't remember it very well which may actually justify my review. I wouldn't however tell you to avoid it. I'll probably rewatch it someday myself just to see how this review stacks up.".

But what bothers me is that it's obvious this movie was made by some westerner or at least someone who doesn't actually know much about China and Chinese people. It's okay to be from a different culture but please do your research. Every time Chow Yunfat's character acted as if he stepped out of a Jackie Chan movie I winced with pain. Since this movie was partially made by a Chinese production company I'm even more disappointed.As for the acting good job Jonathan RhysMeyers. At least he's easy on the eyes. The other actors did an all right job as well. Nothing awful but nothing to write home about. However I and the movie could've done without the heavy dialogue. At points it sounded much too forced and unnatural not to mention incredibly cheesy.It also bothered me that by the end of the move the plot seems to revolve around the main character and his romance. Shouldn't it be less about snogging and more about Hogg's relationship with the children? I thought that was the point of the story and that's why he's famous helping kids in the face of war and cultural differences and not screwing some blonde chick. It doesn't take a hero to do the latter.Beautiful cinematography but poorly written and poorly executed.".

The script was very very weak and there were a couple of times when they had the Japanese fighter planes strafing the ground that you could DEFINITELY tell that they were squibs and did NOT come off as genuine bullets hitting the ground too much spark and flash.

This film is also lyrical deliberately paced and very romantic.Without giving too much away the film takes place in Hong Kong and Singapore in the 60's. The main character Chow is a writer and womanizer. Part of the story takes place in his work a science fiction tale called 2046. The story is told out of sequence with past and present jumbled. In a clever use of irony we gradually understand that the future is being used to tell the past. Some scenes are presented early in a way that is confusing until the context is presented later.There are 3 female characters who are in his life and the story is segmented accordingly.The cinematography is beautiful. Interestingly Wong uses 3 colors nearly exclusively Blood red sea green and yellow. Sometimes he will use light to make those colors stand out other times it is the objects themselves which are in that color.I would characterize the story as one of love and loss. There is one poignant scene where after he realizes what has been happening he states that timing is crucial in love.The film is well acted the characters are understandable if not necessarily ones we can identify with and the story gradually allows itself to be revealed a peek here and a peek there until all the pieces fall into place.Turn off the lights cuddle up with a glass of wine and see this one.

	schema:reviewBody "Review 2046 2004 By Ken LeeSeveral years in the making and highly anticipated 2046 2004 should pacify director Wong Kar Wai's fans at least for its endofanera feel and look. At its core this is a decidedly or deceptively simple movie in spite of its fractured and nonlinear narrative. It tells the tale of an emotionally wrecked man Chow Mo Wan played by Tony Leung a reprised character from Wong's critically acclaimed earlier oeuver In the Mood for Love 2000 and the many beautiful women he keeps and fails to keep in a timespace continuance that is laden with sepiatinted memories a monologue if you will of Chow's torrid love affairs love spats and the ensuing heartbreaks resulting no doubt from the pangs of a failed liaison Chow is trying to escape. It'd appear that the failed relation with Su Lizhen Maggie Cheung in In the Mood for Love who has a special appearance in this film has changed Chow irrevocably which is key to understanding Chow's troubled soul. But it is not a sequel necessarily per se to In the Mood for Love. This film can still be watched on its own though it'd certainly help if you could link moments in 2046 to the director's earlier works for it's laden with jumbled continuity take the character of Lulu for example first seen in Days of Being Wild 1991 hidden meanings read NeoGodardian and other fun stuff sorta an insider's joke if you dig such esoteric things. But I digress. And it's been said that this is a culmination of all the previous filmic experience of director Wong bordering on narcissism hence its endofanera feel and look is duly appreciated and a point well taken.In 2046 Chow's isn't an easily likable character owing to the frailty and the vagaries of his own personal emotions and peccadilloes but that makes him only human and real and his character believable. Take the following exchangeSu Lizhen Gong Li to Chow Mo Wan Tony Leung Do you know my past?Professional gambler Su she who is of the same name as that of Maggie's character in In the Mood for Love asked Chow dissonantly questioning the latter essentially whether there is a future for the both of them if he cannot forget his past. And it's for the same reason or so we're led to believe that Bai Ling Zhang Ziyi is left devastated as Chow cannot treat her any differently from the scores of other women he's seeing hence eliciting the following memorable line from Bai which I'm sure speaks to most of us one way or anotherBai Ling Zhang Ziyi to Chow Mo Wan Tony Leung You may not like me. But I'll like you all the same.What fools we are made by love. Contrasting Chow as a man who dwells in the past and in need of closure to move on Tak Kimura Takuya isn't ambiguous when it comes to matters of the heart. Tak Kimura Takuya to Wang Jingwen Faye Wong I do not know what your answer may be. I dread to know. But I need to know.Here is a man who is not afraid to love and says his love. And he needs to know if his love is unrequited. And in seeking happiness the message seems to be that there is no other way. Now why does this remind me of all the sorry tales with which we are alltoofamiliar with menwhocannotcommitordecide?  And so the film is thusly replete with impressions of repeated variations of the same theme the pointlessness of returning to the past. Which is why we have the following lineBai Ling Zhang Ziyi to Chow Mo Wan Tony Leung Why can't it be like before? The same reason why nobody returns on the 2046 train in Chow's scifi novel of the same name. Seen in this light it is also a doubleentendre for director Wong Why can't this film be like the one before in the form of In the Mood for Love? Where does he go from here?Those familiar with Wong's earlier works will notice his signatures throughout quick cutting slow motion fast motion freeze frames black and white tilt shots color filters neonsign lighting aided ably by three able cinematographers. Production value of 2046 is expectedly topnotch. Music by Shigeru Umebayashi is haunting and sets the right mood. Zhang Suping William Chang Suk Ping does a wonderful job in creating an enrapturing atmosphere set in the late '60s.How great it is in an otherwise desolate world of unease vulnerability hopelessness and pathos we have directors such as Wong to feast our senses. Highly recommended.".

There are few films like 2046 proposing radical new ways of vicariously experiencing time and place. Easily misunderstood or confusing it can be. Understanding and completing the 'story' in these kinds of films doesn't occur in the films themselves. We complete them in the realm of reflection experience and assumptions made in how to reflect collect categorize and morph them with our own life stories. Sometimes these films are just a call to empathize with the filmmaker.Wong Kar Kai is a filmmaker who calls for a personal empathy. He works to capture all the unique dynamics of romance and how they bend our sense of time and space.He turns his camera every which angle to try and find new vocabulary for telling a story. Well he doesn't tell stories he asks whether stories are found in relationships. We get pieces of stories on top of hidden stories our focus shifts from story to emergent feelings out of the glimpses. This is sophisticated and scary when unprepared for the exotic nature. We want the familiar but are given delicately meandering puzzles opaque hints at beginnings middles and endings. Just like we don't always know at what point our own stories are unfolding. But we know the emotional states as they are lived.Since 2046 lacks many standard cadences it is a struggle to follow the statement through the movements. These are not even vignettes these are a seamless series of leaps that push and pull like the emotions of day to day life. They have an indecisive flux we hope is asymptotically reaching a conclusion but they just keep coalescing and spilling over into the imagined future from where no one has yet returned. Once we think we have moved beyond the past do we then realize that we create an unknown future by attempting to reconstruct the past in the present.And so the main character is a writer of 'fiction' this very movie who through the process of embedding real life circumstances into his science fiction he also tries to determine if there is a destination this is all heading. 2046 is a place you visit to relive unchanging memories so that you will never change. Alternately 2046 is also a time existent only within a science fiction novel when people will access substitute lovers without the haunts of what broke them in the past. So they think.He has already been damaged by the loss of an impossible standard that cannot be met by another see In the Mood for Love first!. So in his novel lovers become characters. Feelings become fictional ornamentations in the future. In the present he cannot connect with the women who come and go. In the fiction the lack of connection is simply a matter of technological limitations.Think about what happens in the aftermath of a failed relationship or a missed opportunity. We may grieve but also sometimes we obsessively construct a future fantasy based on what should have happened if things had gone right if only some vital detail didn't change things how it did. We inhabit that imagined future and interact with our counterpart ghost making plans and times and places accordingly. We might use this process as a shield and a warning. Or it sabotages taking on a life of its own as a mental blueprint directing the actual present and perceptions of new companions.Lush poetic cinematography fills each second of this film to great mood inducing effects. In 1960's Hong Kong where the bulk of the events take place the dynamics of romantic encounters hide in unassuming corners of that society only brought to light by looking at the normal world in very abnormal ways. One almost gets the impression that set pieces and abstract designations were literally dreamed up. The camera often cramps our frame of vision. Various offcenter closeups which in a sense shut out the outside world but paradoxically bring it all in to bear. There are many places where the camera does not seem to have a good shot of a character or an event we the viewers were just unlucky to miss the opportunity of getting the full revelation of something.And it frustrates we want to know everything but get very little by way of visual exposition. We are forced to work on the clues the voice overs the symmetrical accidents in different centuries and different countries. This is not analogous to idly putting together a complex puzzle set this is reconstructing a mystery while at the same time being on the verge of shedding tears at the quiet understanding that it isn't a mystery it's life with a character who mediates between reality and fantasy to deal with it all. I know the kinds of things this film is about but I've never looked at them from this stance before. As is often the case the artist here the writerfilmmaker is just the one who experiences what the rest of us experience and talks about its secrets rather than conceals them.See this film if you want to know how it's possible to visually show the invisible inner turbulence and romantic visions that tend to hide from the outside world. On the whole 2046 weaves in the present a future fiction invaded by the past bred by the throes of confronting the human faces of opportunities that appear disappear reappear and fade and collapse into each other.".

	schema:headline " A piece of tragic mind in a sad moment";
	schema:reviewBody "There is a strong tragic feeling the film has given me. The destiny of Tony Leung is sad trapped in the past and the future trying to escape the present time. There are certain scenes and shots imposing this sad sentiment. The stillpicturelike shooting blended with heart striking music has created a space where audiences can go in and feel it. Coincidentally I have seen this kind of shots in Godard's 'Ten Minutes Order' short film  a sigh of life. I remember once in an interview Wong Kar Wai admitted he was much influenced by Godard. I really see it in this film.The interesting thing of this film is the director has gathered different elements from his previous films. Carina Lau is the same character she played in 'The Days being Wild' Faye Wong is from 'Chung King Express' Tony Leung has adopted some personalities of the character in 'Happy Together' and the futuristic story '2046' is same as 'Fallen Angels' particularly the absurdity. It's like a retrospect of the director's previous works viewed at another angle.The main part of the story where Tony Leung gets caught with Zhang Zi Yi is the negative contrast for Tony Leung's tragic destiny. His true love no matter Maggie Cheung Gong Li or Faye Wong is only in the past or future. What he has at present is something he doesn't like trying to escape. In 'In the Mood for Love' he doesn't have the courage to take the love with Maggie Cheung because they both are married. Now in 2046 both Zhang Zi Yi and he are singles but still he doesn't have courage to take it because he is not in the mood for love again instead he chooses to start an indecent relationship with her. The film carries the same symbol as 'In the Mood for Love'  limited space in reality. The love between Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung started in those two adjacent apartments now Zhang Zi Yi and Tony Leung live in the small hotel in two adjacent rooms start their relationship. Life repeats once again in the similar environment the only difference is the choice of Tony Leung. The symbol of 'limited space in reality' is interpreted as an element constituting the routine of life the attitude and choice of a person in this routine is the final ingredient making up the tragic ending. Apart from the tragic feeling the film imposes time and space metaphor. Tony Leung basically lives in the past and future with all his love and sentiment put in these two nonexistent timespace. He has no present life in this sense. The 2046 space though not realistically existing in the film is actually somewhere in the mind of people. Everyone in the film has such a space in hisher mind and so are we all. We don't recognize it only because we don't want to admit it.A film about the past future and present is certainly not easy to master. Although the futuristic part is too robotic the overall impact the film has is significant and remarkable. Not only Tony Leung chooses to escape the present time the film doesn't pass through the present age either. It's another metaphor that we all dwell on the past and future trying to escape the present age forget it as much as possible for it's too bitter to taste and think about.Someone chooses to dream about the future and remember the past so sweetly passing everyday. Someone does it in an opposite manner. It could be the piece of mind or it could be the moment that determines what it would be. What I see in 2046 is a piece of tragic mind in a sad moment.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to watch 2046 after reading millions and millions of interviews and reviews... seriously it was really difficult to keep an open mind about a movie as talked about as this... imagine 5 years of anticipation.I started watching trying my very best to keep an open mind but after a while... i realize i din have to gradually my mind just goes on this journey with the story gone were the reviews and interviews and comments. During the movie i did not think about anything else except wat was happening in the movie. There is so much in this movie that i think i could write a novel about it.This movie is about perceptions and memories. how a memory can dictate the way a person lives his or her life. The stories of the many girls are seen thru the eyes of the charismatic and talented Tony Leung. There are many girls in his life. All these girls have a story a story as seen and perceived by Zhou Mu Yun. The first story would definitely be the story of the first Su Li Zhen Maggie Cheung and Zhou Mu Yun this is the story that shaped Zhou's life even though in this movie Maggie only appears in a few shots. but the basis is all laid out in In the Mood for Love. The second story is lulu's Carina Lau story. The meeting described by Zhou took place in the time span after Days of Being Wild. I find it such a pity that Wong Kar Wai edited out so much of Lulu's story. I would really wish to have seen more of it.Then there is the story of the second Su Li Zhen in Singapore. The mysterious woman who wears one black glove. Zhou finds new solace in her. Using her to fill up the gap left by the first Su.The saddest story in in movie will have to be Bai Yun'sZHang ZiYi. She definite loves Zhou with all her heart but he treats her like a pro. At some point in the movie i wanted to slap both Bai and Zhou. Bai for being so lovelorn and Zhou for being so stupid the girls he love wouldn't leave with him now the girl that loves him so much he refused her over and over.The last and definitely my favourite story would definitely be Wong Jing Wen'sFaye Wong any mandarin speaking person would know that Wong Jing Wen is the moniker Faye Wong went with when she first started singing. Anyway... all these while i never thought Faye could act but i guess with no anticipation there wont be disappointment. And Faye proved that her portrayal of the hotel proprietor's daughter. Wong is the only woman in the movie that is not romantically linked to Zhou although it was hinted that he was in love with her. Wong and her Japanese boyfriendTakuya Kimura were in love but Proprietor Wong refused to even meet the boy. Undaunted Takuya asked Wong to leave with him but her refusal to give him an answer span the very basis of 2046 which Zhou aptly named 2047 in the movie. grinzSelfIndulgent Note I am the Biggest fan of the late Jeanette Lin Tsai from the 50's Cathay era. And i have always felt that Faye looks a whole lot like her. But i will be kissing the ground that Wong Kar Wai step on because he managed to capture Jeanette Lin's essence in Faye. Unwittingly no doubt but it helped me indulged in a memory that i wish to forever keep in 2046.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kar Wai Wong is more than a film director though he is one of the finest directors working today! he is a visual poetic creative and daring artist capable of more cinematic miracles in one isolated film than most directors achieve in a lifetime. '2046' is a visually stunning intellectually challenging emotionally charged view of love and lust in today's kinetically dysfunctional society.There is no one way to interpret this nonlinear film and therein lies much of its rewards. The main character Chow Tony Leung is a writer and a libertine who has pushed his vacuous life around with his hormones and though he has had many affairs he has failed to find the illusory 'love'. He has lived in Singapore and Hong Kong makes his living writing columns of newspapers while his novels formulate in his mind. One of his novels is called '2046' the title based on the room number in a hotel where he witnessed a bizarre incident involving a gorgeous woman and resulted in his moving into the adjoining room 2047 where is meets the hotel manager's daughter in love with a Filipino Japanese man her father loathes. He desires this unattainable woman and fuses her with a fictional 'android' in his novel which now uses '2046' as a year or time or place where people go to find memories. He continues to encounter women for whom he desires more than surface relationships there is a stunning lady gambler cameo who represents everything he lusts and longs for etc but he is never able to find his tenuous ideal his memory is his only source of consolation.The actors in every role include many of the finest actors available Li Gong Ziyi Zhang Carina Lau Maggie Cheung Takuya Kimura Chen Chang and of course Tony Leung. But it is Kar Wai Wong the writer director choreographer colorist visionary that makes this excursion into the interstices of the mindimagination so overwhelmingly satisfying. Whether the viewer elects to view the story as a continuation of the director's previous films or as reality vs memory fiction vs imagination scifi excursion or simply a plethora of vignettes about the challenges of finding love in a world geared toward instant gratification this is a magnificent achievement. In many ways the sound track could be turned off though the beautiful musical score by Peer Raben and Shigeru Umebayashi with a lot of help from Maria Callas! would be missed and the inventive cinematography and visual image manipulations by Christopher Doyle PungLeung Kwan and YiuFai Lai such as the constant dividing of the screen into triptychs and diptychs would remain some of the most beautiful photographic images on film.This is not an easy film to follow and it is most assuredly one that will grow in importance with repeated viewings. The comparison with Alain Resnais' 'Last Year at Marienbad' suggests its potency. But free the mind and enter into the world of '2046' for one of the most satisfying cinematic achievements of the recent past. Very highly recommended. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "2046 is more like the sequel to In The Mood for Love. In the latter mentioned movie Chow was an innocent young man caught up in a complicated affair with Maggie Cheung after both of them discovered that their respective spouses were cheating on them with each other.The movie ended with a desolate Chow trying to put his feet on the ground again after losing Su LizhenMaggie Cheung.I did not realize that 2046 was a sequel only until i was about 14 into the movie. His fate with women is not too good eh? Either he plays them around like some game or he falls in love with the women he cant have. Yet he's not out of league when he fell for Faye Wong's Gong Li's or Maggie's character. Perhaps that's because after losing Su Lizhen in the first movie 2046 only shows how despondent a man can be after being rejected in love. in the beginning of 2046 he said 'he started playing the game and had many one night stands after all how many 'onceinalifetime' can you get?' With every woman he got involved in from Bai Ling to Wang Jing Wen he was just attracted to the bits that resembled his Su Lizhen. I don't think he was actually in love with Wang Jing Wen just in love with the fact that she can conjure up the memories of him writing with Su Lizhen in the hotel in the first movie.His fiction of 2046 being played out directly in the movie was just a further metaphor that was necessary for a complicated man like him to find out what he was after. In the ending of 2046 we see him drunk and alone riding home in a taxi. Where are all the women in his life?Although the show tended towards dragginess at times the screenplay was well written the cast displayed impressive acting skills the lighting's stage settings and soundtrack were unique though not exempting In The Mood for Love. You can well say that Wong Kar Wai is a Tarantino in the Chinese Movies circle.My advice is to watch In the mood for love and 2046 back to back. Perhaps after that the mystic behind the latter will fade and the real plot comes out.".

	schema:headline " nearmasterpiece Wong Kar Wai's 8th film is sensual stylish and affecting";
	schema:reviewBody "I read different takes on 2046 and its connection to its predecessor by writerdirector Wong KarWai In the Mood for Love. Some said you had to see it before 2046 although the general consensus was that the unusual romanticism and little details in both films and actors like Tony Leung and Maggie Chung made the only real connections Wong himself has said ironically to see 2046 before In the Mood for Love. It seems after seeing the film that he was correct I had seen half of In the Mood for Love a while back and I did get an idea of what I might expect but the fact is is that 2046 really does work fine as a film on its own terms. It's a story that at first seems like it will be style over substance and at times it is but the substance is usually very intriguing and keeps attention. It isn't a perfect film and towards the end it starts to lag but such criticisms are made up for by the attributes.We learn from the narrator and lead character Chow Leung that there is a place if not a time called 2046 where people don't leave unless they fall in love. But for the bulk of the film the film is not set in any kind of futuristic setting that might be assumed on the outset of going into the film. It's set in late 60's Hong Kong where Chow writes lurid fantasy stories. He takes room 2046 after seeing a woman Su Li Gong in the room. He feels that this place is where he like others can go to lose memories All memories are traces of tears a titlecard reads which spurs him on the start writing a scifi novel with the room's title. During his stay he meets two women that effect him an abused girl at first acting aloof LuluMimi Carina Lau leaves and the later comes back in the film as a kind of writing assistant for Chow. The more significant woman however is in the form of callgirl Bai Ling Zhang Ziyi a woman so gorgeous it borders on the unreal who like the others takes room 2047 and becomes Chow's drinking buddy. But this soon turns to playfulness to a side affair. Although there is much else that goes on in the film this has some of the best material with wonderful dialog and style giving room for perhaps th best performance I've seen from Ziyi yet.This is not all to the film though it could've been and been as successful. The women in Wong's films like with Hitchcock or even Antonioni or Godard all directors he was obviously inspired by for his own original stance are crucial to how it turns out. These women express everything Wong desires abandons represses flirts and acts cool with. They spur on almost every one of his creative pieces he gives a short story of 2047 to one who wonders why the ending is so sad to which he cannot create a happy one and all of the things he'd rather not forget. Without the strong performances from them all in particular Ziyi Lau and Cheung the drama just wouldn't be there and certainly the style giving much weight to the film would become overcooked and pretentious.The style of which was something I took various notes of while I watched scribbling bits elements colors and shots that caught my eyes the greens in the halls the brightness of outside on the porch the black and white scene in the cab one of my favorites and of course the futuristic visualization scenes of Chow's own 2046. What's curious about the real scifi type scenes is that they make little sense aside from the central point finding real love and the exile following but the atmosphere use of different colors and shots and film speeds Christopher Doyle a DP on most of Wong's films does beautiful work all around is unique and basically saves a dramatically empty sequence.There is also the question of slowmotion which is used to much more effect than in the previous Wong films I've seen and if it is overused. It becomes a distraction only towards the end when one wishes things were not TOO romanticized but many times it is affecting and tries to past the melodrama in some of the above average writing. Overall Wong KarWai displays without a shadow of doubt with 2046 that he is a master of compositions of moods and of creating characters that are true to themselves who feel and love but can't seem to reach for it. But this doesn't make it an 'empty' film. If a scene missteps or something gets irksome with the style it comes back around at the next minutes.".

	schema:reviewBody "A journalist quits his job when his novels became topseller. To be able to finish his last novel he needed inspiration so he revisits a cheap motel which he has lived bittersweet memories with his exlove 2 years ago in 1967. The story takes place in 1969 in the same motel once the novelist decided to stay there.The novel he was writing has been a science fiction at first. Whereas he's driven by a serendipity that the name of this novel 2046 is also the room number in which he and his ex has shared a love. Into that room now a harlot settles in. He enriches his novel by putting himself as the true love of this harlot staying in room 2046. As destiny would have it when the harlot meets him she really falls in love with him. By courtesy of her swallowing his bait the novelist subjoins an erotic component into his novel. Let's gather together the first phase of the movie We have one man and two woman. First woman left him 2 years ago and he is still in love with her. Then at the present time the second woman falls in love with him.The second phase is the vengeance of the novelist from the woman he loved in 1967. This phase forms the essence of the novel The future in the year 2046. Future is under the control of dreamers. Everybody who can dream and who can love can travel into 2046 deep in their heart to recapture their lost memories. The novelist never goes there 'cause he knows that if he goes once he would never return to the present time and would stay stuck in the future living in the memories. Instead of making himself gone he sends her inconstant love into 2046 as an android woman. Living as an android the woman doesn't have a heart. But a young man falls in love with her. She yearns for him so much but she could never express her feelings nor the look in her eyes could ever change since she has no heart no more. She realizes that she deserves to be loved and denies herself. She begins suffering of the love she remained lighthearted to the novelist 79 years ago. Witnessing her repentance the novelist forgives her love and wants her back at the present time in 1969.At the last phase the novelist loses himself before his love finds him. Because his novel concludes to an ending which he doesn't have the love for her true love anymore he depletes his inspirations to finish his novel without the memories of his past love. When she returns to him he stands indifferent. An amazing story layering ahead including tons of short stories inside and the director Wong Kar Wai uses a giddy and ravishing cinematography for use of symbolism. It's the viewers' duty to solve the puzzles of the storyline to match the short stories with their attributions and to set in order of the straightgoing novel versus unsteadily progressing movie which altogether I shared with you above.Both director and the writer of 2046 Wong Kar Wai presents a novel adaptation in the movie and a movie adaptation in the novel in conclusion a mixture of two arts on silver screen.".

Then at the present time the second woman falls in love with him.The second phase is the vengeance of the novelist from the woman he loved in 1967. This phase forms the essence of the novel The future in the year 2046. Future is under the control of dreamers. Everybody who can dream and who can love can travel into 2046 deep in their heart to recapture their lost memories. The novelist never goes there 'cause he knows that if he goes once he would never return to the present time and would stay stuck in the future living in the memories. Instead of making himself gone he sends her inconstant love into 2046 as an android woman. Living as an android the woman doesn't have a heart. But a young man falls in love with her. She yearns for him so much but she could never express her feelings nor the look in her eyes could ever change since she has no heart no more. She realizes that she deserves to be loved and denies herself. She begins suffering of the love she remained lighthearted to the novelist 79 years ago. Witnessing her repentance the novelist forgives her love and wants her back at the present time in 1969.At the last phase the novelist loses himself before his love finds him. Because his novel concludes to an ending which he doesn't have the love for her true love anymore he depletes his inspirations to finish his novel without the memories of his past love. When she returns to him he stands indifferent. An amazing story layering ahead including tons of short stories inside and the director Wong Kar Wai uses a giddy and ravishing cinematography for use of symbolism. It's the viewers' duty to solve the puzzles of the storyline to match the short stories with their attributions and to set in order of the straightgoing novel versus unsteadily progressing movie which altogether I shared with you above.Both director and the writer of 2046 Wong Kar Wai presents a novel adaptation in the movie and a movie adaptation in the novel in conclusion a mixture of two arts on silver screen.";

I get the feeling this was a very hard script for Wong Kar Wai to write it seemed very personal at times. That said the script is absolutely brilliant. One moment in particular where Chow returns a line back at one of his many women is especially sad and poignant really adds a lot of depth to their relationship with a single sentence.The cinematography and special effects are also beautiful although I think the trailer plays up the scifi element a little too much. It does look great though and he mimics many shots and setups from IMFL to tie them closer together.Overall I gave this an 8 the only detractors being a bit of a boring pace at times and the ending seems to come out of nowhere. Just all the sudden boom the end. Still better than most other films made these days and a definite must see for fans of In the Mood For Love.".

The movie is also vaguely related to Days of Being Wild in 1990 costarred by Leslie Cheung and Maggie Cheng. All three films are about the mixture of hustlebustle and weariness of Hong Kong in 1960s.Tony's performance in this film was again brilliant. Faye Wong performed in WKW film for the first time in 10 years since Chung King Express in 1994 also costarred by Tony Leung and made this film one of a kind. Mysterious gambler Gong Li was also attractive. Zhang Ziyi gave me a positive surprise. The film's technical level costumes music photography etc. is also very high. Someone suggested 2004 Cannes Palm d'Or should have gone to this film instead of Fahrenheit 911 and now I can totally agree.The number 2046 is the metaphor of Hong Kong's destiny which implies the last year of statusquo for 50 years guaranteed by Chinese government.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kar Wai Wong is without a doubt one of the best directors today. That said with 2046 he achieves something of an impressive feat with this film that keeps reminding us of his previous In the Mood for Love which in comparison pales next to this new installment of Mr. Wong's take about the life of the character of the previous film. The gorgeous cinematography of Christopher Doyle Kwan Pun Leung and YiuFaiLai has a rich texture throughout the film and the haunting musical score by Peer Raben and Shiguru Umebayashi fits the movie like a glove.Some people commenting in this forum have expressed the view of Mr. Wong's film being futuristic because the way the film starts. But basically those futuristic sequences last so little on the screen that it might be a misnomer for 2046 to be deemed about the future when in reality we are taken back to the sixties when Mr. Chow is seen so much in love with Bai Ling.Mr. Wong gives us a vivid account of what the two lovers had together but he also takes us back when something is revealed about Mr. Chow we never knew about his involvement with SuLi Zheng the mysterious woman who is lucky in winning for him an enormous amount but while he falls in love with her she coolly lets him go.We are also shown Wong Jing Wen who Mr. Chow had a passionate love affair with in the previous film. It appears the involvement they both had is now clearly forgotten or maybe it wasn't as important as it once appeared to be.The director's technique calls for an infinite amount of medium shots usually over the shoulder of the person that listens. As a matter of fact there is hardly any scenery in the film since most of the action either takes place while the characters are seen in conversation or in bed where some of the torrid encounters take place. The futuristic scenes seem to be a sort of limbo where the characters like the beautiful Android seems to in in a world of her own.The best asset in the film is the music the director adds to the different scenes. Some of the music is nostalgic some operatic or depending on whatever is being emphasized at the moment. The music enhances the action in ways that make the film hard to forget.The best thing the director has in the film is the enormously talented Tony Leung. Mr. Leung is an actor that is always interesting to see in anything. In this film Mr. Wong and his main actor show how attuned they both are to their collaboration. Ziyi Zhang is tremendously appealing as Bai Ling the woman that loved intensely and suddenly finds herself on her own after the affair ended. Gong Li is seen briefly as SuLi Zheng the mysterious woman with the one black globe he meets in Singapore. Also Maggie Cheung and Carina Lau contributed to the film as the women in Mr. Chow's life.2046 is a hypnotic piece of film making because the magnificent style which Kar Wai Wong gives to everything in the film to achieve this moody piece that examines love relationships in ways that are seldom seen in the movies.".

	schema:headline " A masterpiece in so many ways and on so many levels";
	schema:reviewBody "Although ostensibly an extension of the story left off from In the Mood for Love in effect 2046 is a retrospective of WKW's past triumphs bringing associations from his most memorable films and in some way tying certain loose ends together. We now realise that Tony Leung's cameo appearance at the very end of Days of Being Wild was actually meant to be Chow Mo Wun postITMFL. We realise this from Chow's chance meeting in 2046 with the gorgeous but tragic Carina Lau who reprised the memorable character Lulu from DOBW. Their brief dialogue shows us that after all these years Lulu never really got over Leslie's character despite her name change LuluMimi in 2046 is but a female version of Leslie a woman with her heart hollowed out so much by tragedy that her bleak existence is only anaethesized by hooking up with toy boys precipitating her own untimely though hauntingly beautiful murder by a jealous lover.The DOBW reference also gave us hints about what Chow's character is like in 2046 unlike the restrained Chow in ITMFL whose true feelings for Su could only be told to a hollowed tree the Chow in 2046 took on Leslie's wild playboy persona because like Lulu the only one he ever truly loved is now forever out of reach.The central narrative then concerns how Chow having lost his one great love Maggie Cheung's Su LiZhen forever search for traces of her in all the women he had met since and that every woman he came across was weighted against her and found wanting with the exception of Faye Wong's hotelier daughter character. His infatuation with Faye stemmed from her love of kungfu novels which brought back tender memories of the times he once shared with Su.The innocence of Faye's character in 2046 is a throw back to her role in Chungking Express with the relationship reversed this time round Tony became the tender guardian. Even though he's quietly fallen for her Chow didn't want to see Faye's budding romance with Tak go the same way as his with Maggie his tender regretful smile when he watches Faye talked on the phone with Tak is one of the many touching moments in the film. Tak's straightforward approach to love also contrasts sharply with Chow's own dithering. When Tak took the guts to question Faye directly about her love and she poignantly couldn't bring herself to answer it seems to signify the end of their forbidden relationship. Yet Christmas' eve's phonecall finally brought the two back together thanks to Chow's direct intervention who managed to save another couple's fate if not his own.Meanwhile Chow had hardened to become a standard playboy bastard echoing Leslie's character in DOBW whose disregard for women feeds directly from his feelings of loss over Su as well as vengeance on his previous cuckoldry. His cruelheartedness is most apparent in his affair with Ziyi Zhang's Bai Ling. Ziyi's stunning performance here proves that she's far more an actress than my previous prejudice credited her for. Ironically it was Bai's wish to protect herself against heartbreak by agreeing to Chow's nostringsattached affair that results in her undoing love proves to be no respecter of human resolve and she fell for him in spite of herself. Chow's cavalier attitude towards her was blatant toying with her feelings just because he could. In Bai's lovelorn eyes Chow could only see a reflection of his previous impotence and his rejection of Bai is as much a rejection of his past romantic failures. He wants to prove he's no longer a love's fool and the price is paid for by Bai's heartrending devastation.Yet in spite of himself Chow could not escape his past even when he's writing a futuristic novel. The dreamlike futuristic sequences with rare glimpses of Maggie acting as an android alongside Carina and Faye show people as emotionallystunted automatons in a train to the future from which there is no escape reflecting Chow's own bleak emotional landscape. The immense beauty of these sequences is a credit to Cheung Suk Ping and Christopher Doyle. Like the rest of the film these scenes fuse flawlessly with the evocative scores offering a sumptuous feast for both eyes and ears. Even though these sequences are almost narratively unintelligible due to the illusive monologue the haunting music and the surrealistic beautiful imagery express Chow's emotional wasteland much more eloquently than any words could articulate.So we came to Gong Li's Black Spider the femme fatale in this tableau of broken women who captures Chow's attention not only by her mysteriousness but by the fact that her real name happened to be the same as his beloved. Her coolness and poise is reminiscent of the previous Su. While ambling down a dark alley similar to the one he walked so many times with Maggie's Su this time Chow eschews his hesitance and grabs Gong's Su for a fiery embrace. Yet despite her obvious affection for Chow Gong saw through him and could not allow herself to merely be another woman's shadow. Each knew they could only have a chance together if they both let bygones be bygones but they realised in each others' looks of regrettable yearning that neither is willing to forget the past no matter how painful and selfdestructive it is to hold on to them. So they parted in the dark alley echoing the previous partings that Chow had with Maggie. Years later when Chow tried to look up Gong again she was like the other Su never to be found again.So much love and loss have been portrayed here with sublime subtlety and verve I still cannot get enough of 2046 even though I've seen it in the cinema three times each time relishing the experience of being swept away in its claustrophobic yet radiant melancholic yet sensual world. This masterpiece deserves repeated viewing to fully appreciate its multilayered meanings and motifs.".

	schema:headline " Demystified";
	schema:reviewBody "SpoilersWith proliferation of mainstream Hollywood films like Pulp Fiction Memento 21 Grams and slightly offbeat flicks like Reservoir Dogs not to mention Mexican Amores perros the most brilliant of them all it would be terribly nave to assume that an average movie goer 'cannot handle anything but a linear narrative' particularly when Wong Karwai's temporal displacement in 2046 isn't that inspired.With five years' worth of films shot for it 2046 can probably have more lives than a cat. The Cannes entry is apparently a cut that was done in a hurry. What we see in town today seems decently put together and quite easy to follow particularly when the director spares no pain in having first person voice over narration bringing the whole affair literally close to 'telling a story' as opposed to letting the camera reveal the story to the audience. The hype about the science fiction element turns out to be just an advertising gimmick. The SF portion of the movie is merely a story within a story a book that the main character Chow Mowan Anthong Leung Chiuwai is writing something quite commonplace that you've already seen in too many movies. Stripped of it mystifying aura 2046 is simply an account of Chow's relationships some erotic some otherwise with a number of women. In the current cut the episode with Bai Ling nothing to do with the actress with the same name is by far most dominating making Zhang Ziyi the de facto lead actress. The relationship with Wang Jing Wen which was the name Faye Wong used during the earlier part of her singing career before she found fame and fortune played by Faye Wong is mentorprotegee rather than lovers as Wang is head over heels with a Japanese boyfriend. The episode with professional gambler Su Li Zhen played by Gong Li is the shortest with a brief mention at the beginning and some tenfifteen minute development towards the end. It may of course be quite different in an alternative cut. Carina Lau and Maggie Cheung have merely cameo appearances serving as links to the references mentioned below. There is a lot of selfreferencing to Wong's other movies in fact so much that it borders on Narcissism. The game of tracking down all the referencing can be endless. For the fun of it let me offer one that may not be that far fetched. The part about Wang Jingwen Faye Wong changing Chow's story at will is a subtle jab at what happened to Louis Cha dean of martial art stories similar to Isaac Asimov being dean of science fiction when he left the continuing of a story in a daily newspaper to a close friend for a couple of weeks while he himself was on vacation. He came back finding one of the main characters blinded quite against his original intention.The artwork both visual and audio are there as always. The music bears the mark of painstaking selection. Used most is 'Siboney' liberally used but not overused. It was also delightful to hear 'Sway'.Anyway this is the cut we have been presented with. Personally I wouldn't mind seeing another cut that has more of Gong Li and Faye Wong and less of Zhang Ziyi. We may well see that in a 'Director's cut' or a DVD version. To those who worship Wong Karwai like a demigod your thundering applause is duly noted. For the rest of us it's just another movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "SpoilersWith proliferation of mainstream Hollywood films like Pulp Fiction Memento 21 Grams and slightly offbeat flicks like Reservoir Dogs not to mention Mexican Amores perros the most brilliant of them all it would be terribly nave to assume that an average movie goer 'cannot handle anything but a linear narrative' particularly when Wong Karwai's temporal displacement in 2046 isn't that inspired.With five years' worth of films shot for it 2046 can probably have more lives than a cat. The Cannes entry is apparently a cut that was done in a hurry. What we see in town today seems decently put together and quite easy to follow particularly when the director spares no pain in having first person voice over narration bringing the whole affair literally close to 'telling a story' as opposed to letting the camera reveal the story to the audience. The hype about the science fiction element turns out to be just an advertising gimmick. The SF portion of the movie is merely a story within a story a book that the main character Chow Mowan Anthong Leung Chiuwai is writing something quite commonplace that you've already seen in too many movies. Stripped of it mystifying aura 2046 is simply an account of Chow's relationships some erotic some otherwise with a number of women. In the current cut the episode with Bai Ling nothing to do with the actress with the same name is by far most dominating making Zhang Ziyi the de facto lead actress.

	schema:reviewBody "I believe Kar Wai Wong is one of the greatest directors this planet has ever seen. His ability to bring images and characters together cannot be compared to any other living director. He is original energetic and all together poetic with his form and style. Wong's work is what those infamous directors of Hollywood dream about at night. I was impressed with his gripping tale of love in Happy Together and mesmerized by his emotionally draining film In the Mood for Love. Wong is brilliant behind the camera creating some of the most beautiful visuals ever to grace the silver screen. Alas I can spend all day here speaking about this master's work but it doesn't conceal the fact that 2046 was not his best work released. As a man who enjoyed Happy Together and In the Mood for Love I was expecting nothing short of perfection with this film yet somehow I did not get it. I believe I was duped by the marketing behind this film. I must warn others that if you are renting this film expecting a science fiction film you will be greatly disappointed. I even thought that it would follow a path similar to Blade Runner but again I was wrong. After watching 2046 all I could think about was Wong's refrigerator. This film reminded me of all the leftovers in Wong's fridge. If you took all the elements that made his prior films extraordinary and slopped them together on one plate threw it in the microwave and watched it cook than you would be experiencing 2046. This film was nothing more than Wong's leftovers handed to us in hopes we wouldn't see through the charade.Harsh words I agree but I didn't feel the emotional strain the power of the characters or the challenge of the story as I did with his prior two films that I experienced. Kar Wai Wong is a brilliant cinematographer capturing some of the most beautiful images in film I believe though that he didn't quite know what to do with them all in this film. In 2046 we are handed nearly pounded down with image after glorious image of characters attempting to build their lives together. With pastels blurred backgrounds and off centered camera angles Wong has created one of the most beautiful films of 2005! Yet no amount of beauty can honestly disguise leftovers. Everyone in the house knows what you are serving there is no need to literally colorcoat it. One of the images that annoyed me greatly was that centered around Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Ziyi Zhang in a taxicab after a night of drinking. We even revisit it later in the film but was annoyed me about this scene is that it is exactly the same scene from Happy Together nearly cut and pasted onto another film. The final conclusionary remarks of this film were completely reused from In the Mood for Love while breathtaking in its own sense it just didn't work for me to have all of these repetitive scenes. I wanted creative Kar Wai Wong but all I was handed was a poorly spliced reprint of his older films.Science fiction is a difficult genre to handle. A GOOD scifi film is a rarity. 2046 is not a science fiction film. For those considering this film due to the scifi press that it received you will be surely misguided. There are moments in the film that are supposed to be in our future but they are so poorly crafted that they distract from the already budding story. I believe it is these science fiction train elements were cheap dull and completely underdeveloped. In fact they stole from the rest of the film. In 2046 it is not uncommon for you to find yourself completely caught up in a character learning about their mannerisms and challenges only to be snapped into this random world which trains have apparently become the dominate species. While other praise Wong's work in these moments of the film I believe them to be very unlike Wong. These paper mache science fiction elements were not the reasons I first fell in love with Wong's work. While changing genres may work well for the likes of Spielberg and Ang Lee for Wong it doesn't. Wong does better with his character driven stories that are simple yet beautiful enough to keep your eyes on the screen. 2046 was so poorly developed that sleep seemed like a better option and I hate to say that about Wong's work.The characters were decent with the material they were given. Ziyi Zhang gives a Nicole Kidmanesquire performance that should open up more and more doors for her. Her range is amazing and I think that Wong captured it extremely well. This was less of a characterdeveloped story and more of an actual plot which is where I believe Wong theoretically shot himself in the foot. Wong need to keep with characters and beautiful scenery and his stories will then just fall into place. I must admit this was a confusing tale. I was intrigued one minute and befuddled the next. 2046 is not a film for the light of film watchers. It is not your date night film but instead one that needs to be watched with microscopes attached to your eyes to ensure that you do not miss any elements. I a novice film watcher had trouble following this film. Wong didn't fully have his direction tied on tightly enough with this film.Overall I wasn't impressed. I could not watch this film again. I saw what Wong wanted to accomplish with this film I do not think that he had enough control over the finished product. 2046 reminded me of my first thesis paper. I knew what my thesis wanted to be but it was buried so deep within my paper that it ultimately ruined the entire body of work.Grade  out of ".

Calling Wong Kar Wai a hack is an insult to all of the real hacks who are churning out garbage and making a mint from dumb audiences  the real difference is here that Wong Kar Wai fans actually believe they're watching something amazing smart and groundbreaking.A film for emotionally stunted 15 year olds the story involves a complete moron whose inability to deal with the women in his life or treat them as actual humans leads him back to a hotel room of emotional significance in which he proceeds to write a horrible scifi story courtesy of LG! in attempt to deal with the fact that he's so immature and so pathetic that he can't have any real relationships only hollow shells because he is human waste.The film which drags on for at least 2 12 years chronicles his pitiful communication and 'relationships' in a way so stupid I can't believe that people didn't walk out of the cinema. Take special note of the fact that the Japanese woman living at the same location has a boyfriend  he himself notes this at the beginning  then later he can't figure out why she doesn't love him. For almost half an hour he writes his bizarre rubbish about how she's a robot and how robots cannot love until shock horror! He realises that she has a boyfriend and actually loves him. It's so completely ridiculous it makes me want to jump in front of a train and yet romanticised to the extent that people actually buy it as some kind of fantastic artdrama.This film is made for idiots. Little boys posing as men who fail in relationships just like the protagonist  they're the idiots flocking to this crap. Oh as well as all of the other Wong Kar Wai fans who are really beyond hope.

	schema:reviewBody "I am a great fan of not only Hong Kong cinema but Wong Karwai in particular. And since this was a followup to his marvellous film In the Mood for Love which ties into the world founded in his elliptical perplexing 1990 masterpiece Days of Being Wild the anticipation was high...Unfortunately 2046 represents a kind of selfimplosion for Wong whose films have always been stubborn in cutting their own path in the face of audience needs and expectations. Now when he was making films like Chungking Express which is a film purely for film lovers he alienated the mainstream while hitting chords with the cineliterate folk who had not had their pretentiousness fed in such ways since the heights of Godard. But 2046 sees the man who was once the most exciting filmmaker in the world stray into David Lynch territory  not in terms of style but the fact that he has finally fallen into making a pretentious film for pretentious people.2046 carries the familiar meditations on lost love and emotional masochism and detachment that are the staples of all of Wong's previous films but the deliberately confusing structure make this blend of period drama and surreal scifi more frustrating than the joyous puzzles he usually presents. In distancing the audience so profoundly Wong draws attention to the fact that his film is glorifying in its own triumph and importance.It not only leaves you cold but furthermore it results in a film that fades from the memory extremely quickly  not a charge to be aimed at any previous Wong Karwai film.Visually stunning as always with scenes of real power and poetic insight 2046 is well worth seeing but does not compare to the other films this director has made.".

And since this was a followup to his marvellous film In the Mood for Love which ties into the world founded in his elliptical perplexing 1990 masterpiece Days of Being Wild the anticipation was high...Unfortunately 2046 represents a kind of selfimplosion for Wong whose films have always been stubborn in cutting their own path in the face of audience needs and expectations. Now when he was making films like Chungking Express which is a film purely for film lovers he alienated the mainstream while hitting chords with the cineliterate folk who had not had their pretentiousness fed in such ways since the heights of Godard. But 2046 sees the man who was once the most exciting filmmaker in the world stray into David Lynch territory  not in terms of style but the fact that he has finally fallen into making a pretentious film for pretentious people.2046 carries the familiar meditations on lost love and emotional masochism and detachment that are the staples of all of Wong's previous films but the deliberately confusing structure make this blend of period drama and surreal scifi more frustrating than the joyous puzzles he usually presents. In distancing the audience so profoundly Wong draws attention to the fact that his film is glorifying in its own triumph and importance.It not only leaves you cold but furthermore it results in a film that fades from the memory extremely quickly  not a charge to be aimed at any previous Wong Karwai film.Visually stunning as always with scenes of real power and poetic insight 2046 is well worth seeing but does not compare to the other films this director has made.";

It invites the viewer to a world of time year 2046 when Hong Kong truly integrates with mainland China the past the present and the future of the storyteller and space the hotel rooms 2046 and 2047. The film urges the viewer to look at the future with nostalgia for the past not its achievements rather its missed opportunities. On the face of it all it appears the battleground of the four dimensions revolve around manwoman relationships. But the director teases the viewer is that all that is presented? 2046 probably eclipses Hollywood's Matrix and Minority Report in its elliptical storytelling. 2046 is a heady mix of fine screenplay alluring cinematography and clever choice of music. Not having seen the prequel to this film I might be at a disadvantage at appreciating several nuances.I saw the film during the recent Dubai Film Festival within 24 hours of two other engaging films Kong Kue Peacock a brilliant Chinese film and the Italian film Consequences of Love and I cannot but help compare the three. Kong Kue leaves you satisfied of having seen a great film Consequences of Love makes you marvel at how Buster Keaton and Tati can be creatively adapted to contemporary tastes with similar symbolic hotel rooms as in 2046 and 2046 enthralls the intelligent viewer without satiating his intellect. 2046 unlike the other two does require more than one viewing.While all three are major films one fact is quite evidentthe current decade seems to belong to serious Chinese cinema just as the previous decade belonged to Iranian cinema.".

Mood was for the most part coherent and achingly lovely in its looks and sounds. 2046 is also visually enchanting and the soundtrack again includes pop hits from the period as a nostalgic touch but the visuals and sounds are less impressive than in its predecessor and in every other sense 2046 isn't as good a film as Mood.Most of the earlier film was set in Hong Kong in 1962. Two neighbors Chow Mu Wan Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Zhen Su Li Maggie Cheung found themselves sadly adrift after their spouses had jilted them and gone off together. Chow and Mrs. Zhen slowly developed an oblique reticent formalized and chaste relationship but it was nonetheless comforting.Chow we were given reason to believe came to care more deeply for Zhen perhaps than she was able to requite. Near the end Mood became fragmented and difficult to follow as the years slipped by to 1966 and Chow a newspaper correspondent was assigned abroad first to Japan later to Singapore. Once he returned to the old apartment house in Hong Kong searching in vain for Mrs. Zhen.2046 picks up the story in 1967. The narrative seems confused and muddled by design perhaps because it is meant to represents Chow's memories and dreams rather than a real sequence of events. Mr. Leung's character Mr. Chow seems transformed in personality and not for the better when compared to his conduct in Mood. Rather than the wistful subdued formal and tactful man he used to be he has become hedonistic unctuous predatory toward women a drinker and gambler sort of a nasty fellow.The new film moreorless traces his encounters with three women in the late 1960s in Hong Kong Wang Jing Wen Faye Wong Chow's landlord's daughter who is in love with a Japanese man Chow's relationship with Ms. Wang is platonic though in a futuristic fantasy sequence he has an amorous encounter with a robotic woman identical in facial features to Wang Bai Ling Ziyi Zhang a prostitute bunking in the room next to Chow's  they share sex and drink a lot together and Zhen Su Li Gong Li a black clad femme fatale gambler with the same name as Chow's love interest in Mood. Maggie Cheung also puts in a minor appearance as the original Zhen Su Li.It's hard to know exactly what's going on much of the time. As Roger Ebert notes so eloquently the film exists primarily as a visual style imposed upon beautiful faces. Just for the record the number 2046 stands for 1 the room next door to Chow's at the Oriental Hotel 2 a room with the same number in the earlier film Mood 3 the title of a science fiction novel Chow is writing 4 a mythical place that may or may not be identical to what's in the novel a place we can all go to in order to embrace all of our memories though no one who goes there ever escapes except for the Japanese man who may be Wang Jing Wen's sweetie and 5 the future date in fact when Hong Kong's quasiindependence from mainland China ceases.If there's an overarching theme that spans Wong's two films and there may not be one except in the imagination of the viewer it might be that life is plagued by discontinuities ruptures even that can be ruinous the only hope of pulling things together lies in accessing our memories and dreams but alas they are discontinuous as well. If we give in to the dream world totally we are lost to this world we never come back. The only other option available is not to care to inure oneself to live for today and shunt all genuine feelings aside.If you endorse any of the following three criteria I think you'll like this film 1 If you liked Alain Resnais' Last Year at Marienbad 2 If you enjoy songs by Nat King Cole or 3 If you love to gaze at gorgeous oriental women. I preferred the more tightly woven storyline in In the Mood for Love. Oh and also the rain...I missed Mood's rain in 2046. In Cantonese Mandarin  Japanese. My rating 610 B. Film seen on 103005.

I was riveted to the images  he is truly a modern painter. This is not to be underestimated. This is enough to get you through the whole movie despite its crawling pace. Simply for the images I can understand that many viewers would love this movie.But it takes more then that to make the ultimate love movie as it was advertised here in Germany. I found many parts in the movie confusing and mixed up I got the impression towards the end that the movie might not be in chronological order. If it isn't then there is much more to investigate for me if it is then I have to say that the movie isn't that clear and that the characters motives and feelings are not always properly portrayed.If this was a book I would love to read it. Simply to get into the heads of the characters and find out what they were thinking what was driving them and how they were feeling. Perhaps that is what is left out perhaps that is why we find it so odd here in the West. We are used to romances being opened and voiced and usually simple. We are not used to people feeling emotions but hiding their motives behind those emotions which might be more understood in a conservative society such as China.This is a movie I would love to own and watch over and over again just to try to understand if there is any magic hidden that cannot be seen at the first watching. I would not be surprised if that is how it is but the long dragging scenes might hinder me from sitting though it more then 2 more times because it drags. Perhaps next time Kar Wai Wong should hire a brutal editor and good writer to get his ideas out because this movie had greater potential then what it became. Still for me it gets 710  its far from BAD.".

He has many little flings with the women in the story sexual or not and he doesn't bother to learn a thing about them. Personally I'm sick of seeing supposedcharacters in cinema and overall mediums who don't give a damn about exploring and experiencing themselves and others mainly because those kind of people DON'T EXIST.Zhang Ziyi plays the role of a spunky snappy and playful glossygirl who's actually just quite lonely.

Wong Kar Wai shows this in every single character and situation in his movie by denying any kind of drop of realness to grow or exist in their beings.The main metaphor of the story in a story in this film was how all the women Cho Wo Man encountered are essentially androids with a delayed response time. Wow. Just wow it's hard for me to believe that there are people who just shove others into a big boxes and shut it labeling it JUST ABOUT NO POTENTIAL.I've tried to at least give benefit of the doubt and say there was something positive in this movie but I've failed.

I feel like if you have seen depth in people around you which I assume most of you have as living and breathing people it's unfair to yourself and others to utterly deny it.Referring back to my review's title please go watch a Federico Fellini film. At the very very least he uses the archetypal characters in a more interesting and productive way in 8 12 and La Dolce Vita. And hey. He did it in black gray and white! Thank you for your time.".

I appreciate quality in cinema no matter what the genre or the origin country is. I enjoy mainstream flicks like XMen slow paced foreign movies like Raise The Red Lantern dramas like Remains Of The Day brainy ruminations like Dead Ringers indie films like Happiness and plain fun like Top Secret. To put it short I tend to like quality. No prejudices.There's however one unwritten universal filmmaking law that has been dramatically overlooked during the production of this movie don't ever bore the audience. Do whatever you like. Do you wish to make a very slow movie? OK right there are a lot of beautiful and interesting slow movies. Do you like long dialogues? OK perfect just remember to keep them meaningful and relevant. The list of movie attributes that can be adjusted to avoid yawning in the audience while being true to your work is almost endless isn't it? Well 2046 managed to bore the hell out of me and forced me to take a look at my watch many more times than it is desirable. In fact the movie felt like it was endless. 129 minutes? God it felt like 229.There are a lot of problems with 2046. The first of all is that this is supposed to be a film about love somebody please correct me if I'm wrong. I don't know if I'm getting soppy with age but 2046 was cold as ice. The direction is distant. The main character is an irritant tiny man that we're supposed to buy for some kind of heartbreaker dandy. I can't empathize with him. Furthermore of all relationships ? presented in the movie the only one appealing hotels owner's daughter is criminally underdeveloped. The story focuses on relations devoid of feeling. But don't think this is a beautiful look on the decadent side of relations between men and women. It isn't either. It's an unsatisfying middle ground where characters you don't care about just come and go.So you'll imagine how surprised was I after realizing how many people were praising this movie. Well not so surprised but I don't want to be pricky.People are eulogizing the direction the lightning and the poetic of the film. Excuse me? 1 With regard to direction camera angles and rhythm are nothing I haven't seen before there are occasional beautiful camera settings but not much more on the other hand there is a cumbersome story development in the most turgid way. 2 With regard to lightning there is some remarkable use of shadows here and there and the darkness of the film is nothing magical it's just darkness the most effective use of lightning appears inside the futurisitc train and my jaw didn't drop. 3 With regard to the poetic the android ministory does it for me and the hotel owner's daughter which I mentioned before is the real deal in the movie. What a pity it didn't last even 15 minutes.I really wanted to like this movie in the beginning. Later I only wanted it to end.As a last comment I've been shocked to hear some people say that 2046 is the Asian equivalent to Lost In Translation. I see what they mean but there is an ocean between both movies. An ocean full of true emotion sense of humor likable characters non pretentious style varied music and endearing happenings.If you are planning to watch this movie because of the hype be warned although you could love it it might be a long long boring trip.RATING 2.3".

The main character is an irritant tiny man that we're supposed to buy for some kind of heartbreaker dandy. I can't empathize with him. Furthermore of all relationships ? presented in the movie the only one appealing hotels owner's daughter is criminally underdeveloped. The story focuses on relations devoid of feeling. But don't think this is a beautiful look on the decadent side of relations between men and women. It isn't either. It's an unsatisfying middle ground where characters you don't care about just come and go.So you'll imagine how surprised was I after realizing how many people were praising this movie. Well not so surprised but I don't want to be pricky.People are eulogizing the direction the lightning and the poetic of the film. Excuse me? 1 With regard to direction camera angles and rhythm are nothing I haven't seen before there are occasional beautiful camera settings but not much more on the other hand there is a cumbersome story development in the most turgid way. 2 With regard to lightning there is some remarkable use of shadows here and there and the darkness of the film is nothing magical it's just darkness the most effective use of lightning appears inside the futurisitc train and my jaw didn't drop. 3 With regard to the poetic the android ministory does it for me and the hotel owner's daughter which I mentioned before is the real deal in the movie. What a pity it didn't last even 15 minutes.I really wanted to like this movie in the beginning. Later I only wanted it to end.As a last comment I've been shocked to hear some people say that 2046 is the Asian equivalent to Lost In Translation. I see what they mean but there is an ocean between both movies. An ocean full of true emotion sense of humor likable characters non pretentious style varied music and endearing happenings.If you are planning to watch this movie because of the hype be warned although you could love it it might be a long long boring trip.RATING 2.3";

Curiously though Harrison was one of those muscular physiquemodels who went to Europe in the wake of Steve Reeves' success as Hercules he plays this whipping scene with his shirt on and that shirt must be made of a super fabric before it never shows so much as a rip!The action soon becomes wearying however because the muddled plot never generates much interest and the characters' motives and allegiances are confusingly presented. Even fans of spaghetti westerns may want to skip this one.Note though the song heard at the beginning and end of the movie refers to Ringo that name is never used in dialog in connection with the Richard Harrison character who instead goes by the names Lee Barton and Ward Cluster. Also the 100000 referred to in the movie's American title seems inaccurate since the trove of lost money proves to be 200000.As for Harrison's flogging scene it would probably have been included in the book Lash! The Hundred Great Scenes of Men Being Whipped in the Movies had Harrison played it with his shirt off. This attempt to flog information from Harrison does provide the movie with its best dialog.

	schema:headline " Decent SpaghettiPaella Western shot in Spain with two ordinary genre stars  Richard Harrison and Fernando Sancho";
	schema:reviewBody "This Italian  Spanish coproduction qualifies as an enoughbudget midbrow western  a soso level before the great Spaghetti westerns . 100000 for Ringo has a thrilling start when a woman is relentlessly pursued by Indians  a bit later on  she is murdered by a mysterious killer . The murderer will blame the innocent Indians about the crime . Then  a white men posse attack an Indian tribe  carrying out a brutal slaughter . Meanwhile  a wandering drifter called Ringo Richard Harrison arrives in a ranch where he's mistaken for a former resident named Ward Cluster who was believed dead in the Civil War . Cluster's spouse is now dead but his young son  Sean Loris Loddi raised by Indian chief  Gray Bear Rafael Albaicn  also believes Ringo to be his daddy and the kid plans a future with him .

Ringo joins forces with a bounty hunter Fernando Sancho and a sheriff Luis Induni attempt to restore peace and order . Cherry seeks to find 200000 stashed away by a Mexican general Tomas Torres and during the course of his chase captures and flogs Ringo .This stirring tortillaRavioli Western packs thrills  shootouts  noisy action  and riding pursuits . ItalianSpanish coproduction filmed in Catalunya  full of familiar faces  assaults  exaggerated characters  crossfire  lots of shots and fights . Starring Richard Harrison as a stranger rider  he is pretty nice  he ravages the screen  he jumps leaps and bounds  hits and runs  besides  receiving violent punches  whipping and wounds . Worthwhile watching for a demonstration of the confrontation between Richard Harrison and Gerard Tichy with some looks that say it all  including an exciting ending . Strong and robust Richard Harrison was a magnificent muscleman . Harrison played in Hollywood some minor roles as Kronos South Pacific and Master of world . Then  Harrison jumped at the chance when offered the first character in 1961 The Invincible Gladiator  which was filming in Europe . He wound up settling in Italy for the next two decades . To avoid being penned in too much as a muscle man  he sought characters in routine spaghetti westerns as Texas the Red Gringo Reverendo Colt  Joe Dakota  even the main role from For a fistful of dollars was offered to Richard Harrison  but he turned down and explaining  Maybe my greatest contribution to cinema was not doing Fistful of Dollars and recommending Clint Eastwood for the part . Support cast is frankly good  thanks to the boastful Fernando Sancho  playing a likable bounty hunter . He played a Mexican outlaw lots of times  as he starred multitude Chorizo or Pipperone Westerns  as the quarrelsome  swanky Mexican bandit  such as  A pistol for Ringo Return of Ringo Requiem for a Gringo  Dakota Joe  Winchester Bill  The Man Who Came to Kill and several others . Other important secondaries are the followings  Gerard Tichy as Tom Cherry who used local Indians to drive off settlers  subsequently turned against the Indians  Eleonora Bianchi as Deborah  a blonde townswoman who loves a drunken man played by Massimo Serato or John Barracuda  Mnica Randall as a beautiful Indian  Francisco Sanz as Jos  Toms Torres as Mexican General  Luis Induni as Sheriff  Frank Oliveiras  Cesar Ojinaga . Being decently photographed by Federico G. Larraya in Eastmancolor  Techniscope  though is necessary a fine remastering because of the filmcopy is washedout . Mostly filmed in atmospheric scenarios on location in Fraga  Huesca  similar to Almeria  and a Western village located in Spugles De Llobregat built by producersdirectors brothers  Alfonso Balczar  Francisco Balczar  Juan Jose Balcazar though this Balcazar family went to bankrupt and had to sell the terrains . It resulted to be the locations where were shot lots of Westerns produced and directed by Catalan people  because Almeria was too far and the Fraga landscapes bear remarkable resemblance . There are many fine technicians  film editing by Teresa Alcocer  nice assistant direction and adequate production design by the usual Juan Albert Soler  the latter creates an acceptable scenario . Climatic and enjoyable musical score  including catching leitmotif  by Bruno Nicolai  usual collaborator to Ennio Morricone  adding a wonderful song  Ringo . One Hundred Thousand Dollars for Ringo was well produced by Alfonso Balcazar productions that financed lots of Westerns . Most of them starred by Richard Harrison  Jorge Martin or George Martin  Luis Davila  Daniel Martin or Robert Woods . The motion picture was regularly directed by Alberto De Martino . He managed to make a fluid and filled with thrills  duels  attacks  and shots  though average . He was an Italian craftsman  working from the 60s in all kind of genres and B movies .

	schema:reviewBody "Well I never thought I'd slag off ANY spaghetti western director's entire body of work but I think in A De Martino's case I'll make an exception. There are VERY few of the genre that I don't enjoy watching even when not very good. I've watched all of this director's SW's now including the rare Gli Eroi di Fort Worth and I have to say that if all SW's were like this I would not own even one and I've over 200.It's hard to put your finger on what's so...boring and irritating...about his movies yeah Banditi a Roma is just as bad. I mean there are LOTS of plot inconsistencies and anachronisms and poorly constructed sets on MOST SW's and that never irritates me. It does with this guy though. His errors err on the side of Hollywood. The screen writing is something I'd expect from a primary school production. You never care about his characters even that they get what they've got coming. HORRID special effects and like I said that usually doesn't bother me much. ALWAYS messes actual history up in a way that makes no artistic statement. Fixated on Apaches they were only in West Texas. Really poorly done Apaches. There's a girl with really really thin dyed black hair...but her braids are as thick as my first.His stuff must be hell for method actors. There's never a rhyme or a reason for the characters' behavior. The kid in this one has two faces he can pull cheering someone on and being upset. So he randomly chooses between the two. Constantly. Every 3 seconds. No reason. No reason he'd change so quickly then back then change. That's acting right? We never have a clue in this why the protagonist is interested in Cherry or how he knows what he does. Was this supposed to be like the Return of Martin Guerre??? I kept expecting we'd hear that he knew the character they all keep mistaking him for but no. That would be a coherent plot and this bloke's screen plays NEVER have that.I guess the only use for his work is to see if a SW fan is of the kneejerk ego identity variety or if they still retain some discrimination. If they like this one they're definitely in the first basket.Bottom line this one is the visual equivalent of the soundtrack to Keoma. Yeah.".
