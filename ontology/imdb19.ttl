During his quest he survives the horrors of the battle in which he actively participate.The film is full of scenes of war desperate efforts of the Russian soldiers who defended the fort during the most certainly futile struggle. While it is a fortress under siege the German army has penetrated far beyond the fortress that is doomed to fail but even when they find out Russian soldiers decided to fight to the end. Excellent film directed complemented by the strong acting and perfect music. Scenes of war are almost epic presented with the harsh reality.Brest Fortress is something similar like the American fort Alamo just became much larger and more powerful symbol of the perseverance of Russian troops tragedies and ultimate victory.The film certainly has to be seen and the quality of acting directing and scenes of war beyond almost all the western movies so far recorded.The film shows the people and the destiny woven through this historical epic about the Brest fortress. Avoided and quite nice skilled and successful politics and ideology and instead of great political speeches film shows pure heroism struggle and an iron will not only from the military fortress of the crew but also the entire Soviet people to defend the country from the fascist hordes .Ordinary people cooks musicians soldiers doctors civilians become suddenly on that fateful morning of the 22nd June 1941 heroes they want it or not they like it or not. The film shows the harsh reality. Absolute lack of preparation and complete negligence of the Soviet army before the dawn of war a total neglect of the defense of the nation from German aggression.

Then the fighting begins and it truly doesn't let up from there. There are several scenes of intense violence it's a war movie what do you expect? but overall they were very tastefully done this isn't SAW VI after all.Now I did have a few complaints such as extremely poorly designed replica MG34's they look like a hybrid between a '34 and an MG42 but overall this movie is the best war movie I've seen in recent years and it's definitely a nice change of pace from watching Jude Law acting like a cardboard standee of himself in Enemy at the Gates.".

	schema:reviewBody "A convincing and brutal drama about the war's ugly and scary face which is as much poignant as it is riveting and engrossing from start to finish.The doomed fortress of the border town of Brest was built a hundred years before the first onset of German deceitful invasion into the Soviet land at early dawn of June 22 1941. It had been changing hands several times before notably in 1918 when it was surrendered to the Germans under notorious Brest Peace Treaty. It was released thereafter to the Poles then liberated by the Red Army then transferred to Poland again. Under the Polish administration the fortress was first affected by German air raid in 1939 and significantly damaged under the massive onslaught of the German troops.Before the end of 1939 the city of Brest and its fortress was finally incorporated into the Soviet Union. By the commencement of war the Brest fortress was a home to a number of Soviet military units  infantry battalions reconnaissance and artillery regiments miscellaneous attached units and troops allinall up to 8000 servicemen and several hundreds of their families wives and children were stationed therein.The film starts unfolding peacefully on the eve of the war  a regular day in the lives of ordinary people in a military compound  orchestra rehearsals dancing shopping kisses Saturday evening film screening  the late peaceful everyday routine...Persistent rumors that the Germans were cranking up preparations for a breakthrough on the border were considered as sabotage and eventually suppressed. But anticipation of imminent disaster was intensified by a particularly creepy late night scene of the special vanguard troops disguised in Soviet military uniform disembarking from a train following subdued German language orders.Heavy artillery fire that all of a sudden pierced silence at the daybreak of June 22 instantly inflicted heavy human and material losses disrupted communication cut off power supply and destroyed military munitions. Followed by meticulously coordinated combat assault immediately afterward it took the inhabitants by surprise and split the garrison into several relatively small and isolated pockets of nevertheless pretty fierce resistance.Under massive German attacks the city was defeated fairly early whereas the small number of the besieged Brest fortress survivors with scarce resources deprived of food water and medicine and with narrowing hope for reinforcement or backing from the retreating regular forces kept on defending the small plot of Soviet land against the invaders for many days.Though the essence of the story is certainly a portrayal of the valor of Soviet soldiers that lost their lives defending the first citadel and symbol of Russian resistance the film manages to avoid as much as possible wornout heroic clichs and propagandistic pathos that were often compulsory elements even in the best examples of Soviet war movies of the past. Yet unlike many politically engaged modern movies it resists the temptation to deride the peculiarities of Soviet lifestyle of that time and to speculate on the popular issues of Stalinist regime's atrocities.Instead the film focuses on accurate capturing of a full range of authentic human emotions from joy love and devotion at the early beginning of the film through angst fear and pain as it progresses to hopelessness and despair. It tells the frightening story of regular people which lives were turned upside down overnight when they end up face to face with unstoppable deadly force menacing their families their loved ones their own lives and their country.It pulls no punches when it comes to depiction of enormous destructions and horrors of war with first rate set designs and visually arresting special effects but the main asset of the film is of course excellent nuanced performances from the entire cast especially the leads  Korshunov Merzlikin and Derevyanko.The story is told as if from the perspective of a teenage boy witnessing the outbreak of war and providing narration already as a war veteran that has survived the worst war in modern history. It may be emotionally draining cinematic experience for many viewers but I believe it could be especially conducive for the younger generation to acquire better understanding of the actual tremendous price the nation has paid for the great Victory.".

It may be emotionally draining cinematic experience for many viewers but I believe it could be especially conducive for the younger generation to acquire better understanding of the actual tremendous price the nation has paid for the great Victory.";

There is so much for the eye here I'm very impressed at the amount of work which must have gone into making every shot look so real. Also the soundtrack was not overwhelming for the most part what we see is what carries the emotion and that is a testament to the power of the events and the quality of the reconstruction of them for this movie.There's a lot of violence shooting dying etc. here but not a lot of really nasty gore which is something I appreciate. I'm sure the reality may have been even uglier than what is shown in this movie but I don't need to see every last ounce of gore to know that war sucks and people get horribly maimed and killed.

The small amount of propaganda blown into some gunfight scenes are minimal but never the less distracting at times because of its godlike fighting capabilities given to the Red army who seem to be invincible in hand to hand combat with the Nazis!!!

	schema:reviewBody "If you read my title you might consider the comparison perhaps the most famous American world war epic odd but I'll explain that shortly.To get the necessities out of the waythe film describes the fall of the Brest Fotress in far western Belarus or Byelorussian SSR in this case. The film does not elaborate on the history as already pointed out it does not point out that Brest was captured from Poland just two years earlier courtesy of the BrestLitovsk Treaty. Nor does it mention the Polish population of Brest forced west or deported to the east by the government after that fact. And finally it does not mention that Brest like the rest of Western Belarus was subject to a Polish colonization effort after Poland annexed it during the first PolishSoviet War which they won and under military rule due to conflicts between Poles and Belarusians. All of this is as it happens not relevant to the movie makers and given how few people have heard of the first PolishSoviet War the Polonization of West Belarus or the deportation of Brest's Polish residents it's not surprising. Outside of the CIS countries and eastern Poland you'll be surprised to find anyone know knows Belarus is its own country. Brest is a rough rural but otherwise idyllic countryside townunbelievable from a western perspective perhaps but not in conflict with survivor narratives we have today and intended to set up the disaster that follows.The movie DOES offer some historic context howeverit begins with Major Gavrilov's warning of an impending disaster for Brest and the Brest Fortress in the event of a German invasion though he is dismissed by skeptical comrades more trusting of their country's ally. When the war begins in earnest Gavrilov Commissar Fomin and Lieutenant Kizhevatov rally a bloody nearly fanatical defense of their country and for many their home against the German invasion. This makes up the meat of the movie with the narrative of a foster student Sashka attached to a military band caught in the middle. The war cinematography is thrilling and exciting comparable to the aforementioned Saving... albeit with an emphasis on brutal closequarters fightingexaggerated potentially for the necessity of emphasizing the difference between mechanized warfare in the field and indoor fighting in somewhere like Brest or Stalingrad. Seeing the Soviet defendersmostly Red Army men joined by diehard Frontier troops and a few NKVD Rifle Battalion NCOs from what I seecounterattack German positions with shovels and chairs as well as rifles and machineguns seems unbelievable at first but it doesn't clash with the western narrative of a primitive Red Army or accounts of handtohand fighting from both world wars. The disastrous results that usually follow serve as a reminder that this isn't something fantastical like Enemy at the Gates or an optimistic adventure like Inglorious Bastards. Thhe defenders themselves are portrayed as human and vulnerable capable of tears despair and emotion at inopportune timesthough it suffers from a blink and you'll miss it situation the scant nonSlavs shown in the Red Army. As a war movie it's portrayal of the German enemy is naturally important. The Germans are portrayed as usual as organized very competent and extremely cleveran infiltration scene early on wherein German commandos impersonate NKVD NCOs to enter the fortress highlights this. However there's hardly any more demonization of them then in Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers in part because they're also portrayed distantly and hidden in contrast with the very human Soviet defenderswith a few exceptions. In one some Germans are shown about to assault a captured woman who is ultimately gunned downthis is hardly unbelievable and it serves more to show the guilt felt by a civilian Byelorussian at having used the distraction she provided to escape his own fate than the Germans being ravenous monsters. In another the advancing Germans gun down fleeing civilians from a machinegun position. Damning certainly but consider during the German occupation between 2 and 2.5 million people in Byelorussia of nine million perish. The scene if fictionalized is likely intended to demonstrate the particular callousness the Germans as a whole displayed towards Reichskommissariat Ostland. Aside from this Germans usually seem distant and on occasion just as desperate as their Soviet enemies.Fortress stands well with its American counterparts and even decently with epics like Come and See ending with a sobering tribute to the film's historical personalitiesthe vindicated Pyotr Gavrilov is explained as having survived German captivity only to be imprisoned for the act of surrender though the movie inaccurately suggests such a fate befell most POWs when it was primarily inflicted on officers and others who carried more blame only to be rehabilitated and made Hero of the USSR in 1957 in a damning critique of the country and Stalin's complacency towards Germany. The Jewish Commissar Fomin being twice a target of the German Commissar Order is executed immediately. The movie goes out of its way to defend those who did surrender suggested they only did so at the behest of the defenders after army men begged their families to take the German offers for leniency. Soldiers who surrender are shown as only having been human witnesses to extraordinary violence and are understandably broken and even have a degree of sympathy from those who fight on. All and all this is a welldone particularly sympathetic and highly enjoyable war epic that maintains the tradition of sobering portrayals we've expected from CIS cinematography on the Second World war.".

Sure it totally ignores the fact that just a few months before the soviets invaded Poland and probably murdered most polish officers in Brest. Sure it portrays all Soviets  even the NKVD officers  as nice and funny people which probably wasn't the case. And of course all German soldiers are some kind of werewolves.Still it's a great movie. You'll get to know and love most of the characters you'll suffer with them you'll grieve with them.Yes it is a very Russian movie. Russian propaganda if you so will from a Polish perspective. Still one of the best ww2 movies ever and a lot more realistic than certain American movies about American conscripts shooting down elite German SS soldiers as if it was a video game.".

Boy was I wrong...Say what you want about the Eastern front in WWII but if there has ever been a battle for survival that was it in spite of their government and in spite of having contributed themselves to starting the war there is another excellent film Katy about that issue Soviet citizens really did fight heroically for their land against an enemy who wanted them wiped off the face of the earth.

Yes the Soviet government was just as responsible for the colossal defeat in the Summer of '41 than the Germans perhaps more since they were supposed to defend their people. Yes that land used to be until 1939 Polish but the film blissfully leaves those issues which are hinted if briefly clearly enough at the beginning aside and rather concentrates on the facts of that summer.The men and women who were abandoned to their doom took their fate with admirable conscience and great courage and this thankfully enough is represented by the filmmakers with great respect and honesty while a lesser director might have butchered the project with cheap sentimentality or a that's what we'd all do message or with grotesque sanitizing and sanctification director Aleksandr Kott chose to let the facts speak for themselves and let people's decisions describe them.An important note on Brest Fortress and a sign of great rigour and mastery is that we as audience are not moved to say Yeah that's what I would do if I were him. It is a quite relevant feature of modern war films but think about it do you really know what to do? What would you do if you had absolutely no hope of either you or your loved ones getting out of here alive? It really takes nerve to answer honestly to that question and the film both in its clear and profound screenplay and in its powerful images the dirt the violence and the hunger are portrayed as realistically and skillfully as ever does make you say I don't know if I could muster such courage myself. It's quite an achievement for an artist.And it's quite a tribute to the dead.".

Set in the Soviet outpost in Brest Belarus it's an exhilarating film that takes place during the Nazi invasion in June of 1941. Vastly outnumbered the Soviets bravely repel wave after wave of invading Nazi soldiers. The film primarily follows Sasha Akimov who at only 15 years of age was able to move around the fortress assisting many separated pockets of Soviet soldiers. While many believe the United States is responsible for defeating Hitler and the Nazis in reality it was the Soviets who played the biggest role and Fortress of War provides an excellent history lesson in that regard as well as being an exquisitely made film".

His narration ties together three main defensive stages led by real life Soviet war heroes centered on the resistance zones holding out against the protracted German siege. One location is headed by regiment commander Pyotr Gavrilov Aleksandr Koshunov another by the political commissar Yefim Fomin Pavel Derevyanko and lastly the head of the 9th frontier outpost Andrey Mitrofanovich Kizhevatov Andrey Merzlikin. All three have a different story to tell. The film begins in an archetypal peaceful though nervous perwar Belorussia in the summer of 1941. The heavy military presence contained in Brest notably its historic 19th century fortress explains the current political situation in the country following the Nazi conquest of Western Europe and the Politburo's rightful suspicions of Hitler next intended target. The focal characters are simultaneously introduced intermediately around Sasha's observational narration. The ensuing bombardment by Wehrmacht artillery and brutal assault comes without warning and is unleashed with fuming panic. The film thus continues along a direction of separate combat charges and defensive manoeuvres. These numerous skirmishes and scuffles between the two opposing armies are effective edgy and wellstaged. All the combat scenes are extremely effective and mastered by the production team using special effects and pyrotechnics to their full advantage. Because the film was produced by the Belarusfilm Company and in truth many of the cast and crew either lived or parents lived through the nightmare of the Wehrmacht invasion and resultant onslaught of the population the accuracy to detail is visually authentic and at no point attempts to introvert away from the brutality faced by their ancestral soldiers or civilians during these troubled times. Yet it does not go unnoticeable that this film contains blotches of patriotism and benevolence. The narration shifts between characters and their dilemmas in the three separate defensive locations at the beginning may appear to be unclear and confusing. Nevertheless through skillful editing and directing as the film moves along at a steady peace the separate stories begin to coalesce into one and by no means are a distraction.In summary Fortress of War is a firstrate factual dramatised war movie which subjects its audience to the brave climatic struggle for survival and once again is another example of the evolving historical films from the Counties brutalised by ideology fuelled hatred and genocide that was the Second World War.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fortress of War eloquently and with painful honesty captures the true face of war.This film like other Russian productions understands and conveys wars reality without judgment or pretension. For the entirety of this film you gain an insight into the human condition when faced with the cruel horrors of war. You get to know characters to empathize with them and then watch what war does to them. Its not an easy experience but its not mean't to be. Fortress of War ticks all the boxes on the artistic and technical front. The acting in this film is excellent. So much so I quickly became engrossed and forgot I was reading subtitles all the way through. Its sets are fantastic too as are the costumes the action and the special effects. Indeed I can not find a single thing to say about this film that's not positive. Its a remarkable piece of cinema in any language that ranks up there with other Russian classic's like Come and See. Ten out of ten from me.".

I'm immune to some propaganda and onesided view of history that can typically be expected from Russian war films.All in all Brestskaya krepost does a good job showing us the dramatic and heroic struggle of Red Army soldiers. The problem is that the Germans would never do a movie glorifying the bravery of Wehrmacht without showing their cruelty and war crimes for balance. The Russians have no such dilemmas. What am I talking about? The Soviets invaded Poland in 1939 alongside Germans and the city of Brest became part of their loot. Actually it was captured by the Germans back then and handed over to Soviets. The Polish general who was in charge of the Polish defence of Brest fortress was taken captive by the Soviets and murdered by them as part of the Katyn massacre in 1940. In general during those 2 years of reign over formerly Polish territory the Soviets did very nasty things to the people living there so nasty that those who somehow managed to evade prisons and gulags welcomed the Wehrmacht with some hope. But the film shows none of that. Watching the movie I constantly asked myself why are they behaving like they were living in that area since generations? like they were defending Moscow? why are they so faithful to a criminal totalitarian system run by a madman? Red Army soldiers couldn't know in June 1941 that surrendering to Germans meant likely death. Yes you can see some Soviet soldiers surrendering in the movie but still the message seems to scream those were cowards the real heroes fought to the last bullet  totally wrong!".

	schema:reviewBody "There can be no doubt that The Fortress is a cinematic masterpiece with grade one photography acting special effects screenplay pace and emotional depth. None of this is questioned and all readers are recommended to view it. Basing the story from the viewpoint of a child trainee soldier was particularly effective and the film effortlessly holds viewer attention throughout the generous 138 minutes.Moreover the film was well researched in many aspects. Not only were the sets extremely accurate in their portrayal of the fortress but even the ruins were perfectly reconstructed from post war photographs. The officers really existed and their heroism was deservedly depicted.But it is without question a work of huge political propaganda. And it completely failed to illustrate the true horror of war as it really happened.In every battle the wounded always outnumber the dead. Indeed many die subsequent to the injuries of combat and the percentage of soldiers killed outright is normally rather low. War is not a computer game in which the fallen just drop dead on the spot with a little groan. It is a sea of suffering and screaming and agony in which the able are caught in a quandary whether to aid the victims or run for safety.But this was not at all captured in the film. The victims just die instantly and lie there in huge peaceful heaps. Even their faces appear as if they just went to sleep. Of course this is rubbish.The film depicts those Russians that fought on as heroes whilst any soldiers that left are slurred with the implication of cowardice. The Germans are portrayed as inhuman killing machines without compassion and slurred with the entirely untrue concoction of using civilians as human shields in their attack. Russian attacks are shown as courageous head on charges across open ground as if they were led by 19th.century heroes whilst in fact the leadership was inept and too inexperienced to coordinate effective counter attacks. The film did not portray the brutal use of boy soldiers by the Russians as ammunition feeders to machine gun posts and ID tag collectors from the fallen. And Commissar Fomin is shown to have given himself up for execution as a Jew whilst in fact he was betrayed by his own men as a hated Bolshevic. Such details suggest a very different reality inside the stubborn pockets of resistance than the film portrays. And it takes little imagination to understand the motive.'Stalingrad' the notable 1993 epic of that engagement remains supreme in the honest depiction of war and this film cannot reach it. Ultimately heroism and barbarism are individual aspects of battle and not national psychologies. But this film attempts to show good and evil as if there can be a good side to war. And it never suggests that Russian preparations to attack Germany in 1942 were well under way in 1941 and that Hitler only attacked first before Stalin did the same to him.Sorry readers but this film must be taken with a large pinch of salt. Nevertheless I did shed a tear with the old man at the end and my heart went out to the young musician boy as it was meant to.".

Thanks to the rating I was looking forward to experience a different Russian view on Eastern front and was awaiting accuracy on battlefield which I am pretty sensitive about. Everything went good till German attack.POSITIVES first All visuals are good and so are the uniforms vehicles etc. Film managed really good to build calm before the storm atmosphere. I could feel the tension in the air and it made me to continue watching. The film covers everything important in my opinion. Some reviewers have written about a feeling that Russians act in Brestskay krepost like it is theirs for ages and that Russians have committed many crimes in Poland which should have been shown in the movie too. I had this feeling also but I disagree with these reviewers about a matter of showing the background of Russian occupation in 19391941. I don't think it would add anything important to the story. NEGATIVESOverall battle performance and tactics of both sides were at least strange. As the Germans were advancing in extended order towards the Russians first time the Russians have counterattacked into the close combat instead of ambush and relatively safe shooting from the building. There was absolutely no reason to do that. This scene would be much more typical for Napoleonic wars than for 1941. Furthermore attacking in urban areas in extended orders is nonsense. In reality it was about quick moves searching for cover covering comrades etc. German infantry could have used some armored vehicles and move with them while hiding themselves behind them.Waves of Germans trying to get closer to the Russians who were defending buildings and fortress while running without cover or covering fire and therefore dying instantly. Although close quarter combat was not yet developed in these days since 19th century there was a common practice in military of dividing infantrymen into at least two units or platoons where one covers the second during its advance and then they change roles. It would be more believable if one German unit would provide massive fire on Russian positions and the second unit would quickly advance and take some good positions ready to cover the others. One of the German objectives was saving lives of their soldiers which makes the scene with captives quite unbelievable. I don't think they could have exposed their soldiers to potential fire because of some doubtful intent probably to make Russians negotiate or what.Many times Germans shout without a reason just ... to make them look more German? This is at least the Hollywood's idea of Germans but I didn't expect this in a Russian film. For example they shout at each other Be aware of windows fire at will fire... which are pretty empty useless phrases while they are already fighting. When they are yelling this during taking a building it becomes a problem because they tend to reveal their position to the enemy.In spite of the negatives it was a solid movie. If you are not as sensitive about the battles as I am you will definitely enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow! The usually frumpy Costello looks positively dapper in his snazzy salesman's suit at movie's start. Superior AC comedy with good routines productive premise and unusual cast. The boys get to chase around the wilds of a Hollywood sound stage pretending not very hard to be adventuring in darkest Africa. Of course Lou gets to do his slowtocatch on routine as crocodiles gorillas and other assorted maneating critters nuzzle up in humorously menacing fashion. I love it though when that savagelooking kitten scares the beJesus out of him in a downtown department store no less.And whose great idea was it to load up the cast with some real characters. Take the giant Baer brothers Max and Buddy for example. Together they look like they could tear down the Empire State building without a wreaking ball. Not exactly your usual movie types and when they start scuffling you can almost feel the ground shake. Then too what an inspiration to stick cokebottle glasses on Shemp Howard of Three Stooges fame and turn him into a nearly blind biggame hunter! So better hide the house pets. But I really am curious how little fat comedian Joe Besser snuck on set when the movie already had a little fat comedian who's a lot funnier. Add real life adventurers Clyde Beatty and Frank Buck along with the always regal Hillary Brooke who glitters as usual but never gets in on the fun and it all adds up to a lively and entertaining bunch of characters. Perhaps best of all AC are still looking fresh in their roles and if some of the routines wheeze a bit the boys are still able to give them the needed lift something they did not do in the last few years before the final 1956 breakup. Sure this kind of nonsense is not everyone's cup of tea. But I defy even the sourest sourpuss not to surrender a few chuckles as the boys bumble along Africastyle.".

	onyx:emotionText "Wow! The usually frumpy Costello looks positively dapper in his snazzy salesman's suit at movie's start. Superior AC comedy with good routines productive premise and unusual cast. The boys get to chase around the wilds of a Hollywood sound stage pretending not very hard to be adventuring in darkest Africa. Of course Lou gets to do his slowtocatch on routine as crocodiles gorillas and other assorted maneating critters nuzzle up in humorously menacing fashion. I love it though when that savagelooking kitten scares the beJesus out of him in a downtown department store no less.And whose great idea was it to load up the cast with some real characters. Take the giant Baer brothers Max and Buddy for example. Together they look like they could tear down the Empire State building without a wreaking ball. Not exactly your usual movie types and when they start scuffling you can almost feel the ground shake.

Watch for yourself and see.What prevents me from giving this film a higher rating than 6 are the lowbudget sets at Nassour.  Bud and Lou never had a bigbudget film at Universal but this film looks paltry by comparison. What also hampers the enjoyment of the film is the fact that it appears to still be in public domain lowgrade scratchy prints are usually what can be found in the bargain section of the video store.

Most people do not know what a Crosley is. The Crosley was a small somewhat popular car that was built shortly after World War 2 by a refrigerator manufacturer. If you watch this movie until the end you will see Lou getting out of a Crosley station wagon.This is also a pleasant romp through the wild jungle with Bud and Lou and some ex champion boxers famous wild animal tamers one pretty girl and a couple of stooges. The scenes with Clyde Beatty and his lions are obviously real. He was an actual lion tamer. The scene with Lou in the cage with the lion looks very real even though it had to be a blue screen or matte job.One oddity I noticed here was that Lou Costello is playing the part of Stanley Livington no s. First name Stan and last initial L. I wonder if that was a tribute to Stan Laurel? The gorilla is very well played. The gorilla suits used in many of the movies of the 1940s and 50s looked much better than the Chew Baca and other more modern gorillas.Worth a look.Tom Willett".

It's difficult not to laugh at anything Lou Costello does he's just such a superb natural clown you can't help yourself. Bud Abbott has always had the reputation for being the best straight man in the business and it was one he well deserved. While his skill is still evident both he and Lou had gone through some tough times in the previous few years watch The Time of Their Lives one of their better pictures filmed in 1946 only three years elapsed between that film and this one but they unfortunately appear to have aged WAY more than that and Bud was starting to show some signs of the health problems that eventually forced his retirement. The combination of his ongoing health issues he was an epileptic and it got worse as he got older and a severe drinking problem brought on by his condition had slowed him down considerably. He does show signs of his old spark but at other times he seems somewhat sluggish as does Lou. Don't get me wrong there are still some very funny moments in this picture. The routine in the lion's cage still works well and the way Abbott lets his greed overtake him when he thinks he can swindle everyone out of the diamonds is reminiscent of Humphrey Bogart in Treasure of the Sierra Madre and shows what a good actor he could be even without Lou. Although other posters have praised the supporting cast personally I think it's somewhat weak. Shemp Howard is an asset and is quite good even though he doesn't have as much screen time as he should he still manages to make his part memorable. Joe Besser isn't as annoying as he was during his turn in the Three Stooges shorts but that's really not saying much he was TERRIBLE in the Stooges shorts although he was terrific as Stinky in Bud  Lou's TV series. Hillary Brooke while as coolly and regally beautiful as ever is frankly not up to the part. Her character is the villain of the picture and calls for the kind of edge and nastiness that you just don't associate with her and she couldn't overcome that. Frank Buck is Frank Buck and Clyde Beatty is Clyde Beatty and neither were ever particularly good actors as is more than evident but they were never supposed to be they do what they do best and acting isn't it. Max and Buddy Baer are a little more interesting as Hillary's henchmen. They have a nice bit where they're tricked into fighting each other by chimpanzees no less! and it's actually quite funny. The main problem with this film I think is the one that others here have mentionedthe combination of the very low budget and its cheap and rushed look really detracts from its good points. Director Charles Barton was responsible for many of the team's best films but even he couldn't do much with this one.Overall it's one of Bud and Lou's minor works. If you haven't seen it it's worth watching once or twice maybe but that's about it.".

It's not Abbott and Costello's best film but it is one of their better later ones with Lou contributing a very energetic performance which can't always be said of postAC Meet Frankenstein films from the team. There isn't really a story here just a premise in which Abbott and Costello are drawn into a shady African expedition because the person in charge played by Hillary Brooke thinks Costello has memorized a map from a book that will lead her to a diamond mine. The transition from New York to Africa and back again is done in the finest Well here we are on the moon! style employed in radio comedy shows and of course the jungle sets are patently phony but it hardly matters. This is really a burlesque show without the strippers careening from one barelyrelated but often very funny routine to another. The Baer brothers Max and Buddy are the heavies Lon Chaney Jr. must have been busy that month and Stooges Shemp Howard and Joe Besser act as something of a secondary team with Shemp playing a visuallyimpaired thug while Joe doing his usual sissy routine is forced to act as his guidedog. Animal trainers Clyde Beatty and Frank Buck are there too because...well because they could be. There is one funny scene of Beatty doing his lion taming act while Costello who is also trapped in the cage desperately crawls around underneath a wicker stand trying to escape. There are also people in gorilla suits rubber crocodiles and those unfortunate boneinthenose cannibals one of whom oddly sports a skipper's hat. AC's best director Charles Barton keeps everything moving to an absurd end but the point is not to take any of this seriously.".

The Baer brothers Max and Buddy are the heavies Lon Chaney Jr. must have been busy that month and Stooges Shemp Howard and Joe Besser act as something of a secondary team with Shemp playing a visuallyimpaired thug while Joe doing his usual sissy routine is forced to act as his guidedog. Animal trainers Clyde Beatty and Frank Buck are there too because...well because they could be. There is one funny scene of Beatty doing his lion taming act while Costello who is also trapped in the cage desperately crawls around underneath a wicker stand trying to escape. There are also people in gorilla suits rubber crocodiles and those unfortunate boneinthenose cannibals one of whom oddly sports a skipper's hat. AC's best director Charles Barton keeps everything moving to an absurd end but the point is not to take any of this seriously.";

The whole of this film seems to me just a bunch of their old routines and gags run together in order to fill up the running time of a feature film. This is why it's so very difficult even for veterans like AC to keep a film moving especially at feature length. Difficult for the writers first of all to keep a story together and include comedic bits without it all seeming to be just a patch quilt of nonrelated ideas. They all went through this at one time or another i.e. Chaplin Keaton Laurel  Hardy etc. That isn't to say that this is a totally bad film just parts of it. The giant kong like ape that's being searched for for instance is just too much. Good comedy exaggerates the realistic but never should it traverse into the Twilight Zone just for effect. Something that's interesting about this film is that there appears a current Stooge with a future stooge namely Shemp Howard and Joe Besser. Joe Besser was not in my opinion stooge material but here with AC and Shemp he's an actual riot. Ironic. This is certainly not one of the better AC films but worth watching maybe as a double feature with AC Meet Frankenstein.".

There are some items of interest to movie buffs today such as the casting of two of the Three Stooges Shemp Howard and Joe Besser in secondary roles this was seven years before Besser replaced Shemp as the 'third Stooge.' 'Africa Screams' was a rare independent production for AC. It was filmed by Nassour Studios though the team was still under contract to Universal. The previous year had seen Bud and Lou reach the top of the box office after a slump in the midforties with 'Abbott  Costello Meet Frankenstein' arguably their best film ever. Whether 'Africa Screams' was planned prior to that success or was a result of it I don't know. In any event it was a 'oneoff' as AC immediately returned to Universal afterward and stayed there until 1955 when they were dropped. They made one more independent film in 1956 'Dance With Me Henry' before calling it quits for good. 'Africa Screams' is a hodgepodge of old routines a few new ones and an 'African safari' plot that pops up occasionally mainly to justify the presence of animal trainers Clyde Beatty and Frank Buck. The pro boxing brothers Max Baer and Buddy Baer are along for the ride too as a couple of tough henchmen. So we get the obligatory 'liontaming' sequence from Mr. Beatty and a punchout scene with the two Baer brothers. Frank Buck fortunately has virtually nothing to do. Joe Besser has one funny moment when he hears one of the others reveal a secret he punches the guy on the arm and in his best spoiledbrat voice says Ooo you're such a snitch! Shemp Howard like Frank Buck is nowhere to be seen during most of the action and when he is has nothing amusing to do. As for Abbott  Costello themselves they resurrect any number of old routines most of which are not related to the plot at all. It's almost like watching an early television variety show where they come on at intervals do a sketch then depart. Abbott does the familiar bit where he thinks Lou has been killed and delivers a long mournful monologue about what a great guy Lou was and how he Abbott is to blame... even though Lou's standing right there. How many times did AC AND the Three Stooges use that routine? My favorite is Lou reprising the 'whispering threat' business from 'Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap' where he challenges the bad guys to a noholdsbarred fight but from a distance where they can't see him and in a voice so slight they can't hear him. For about three minutes it's a very funny film. The casting of Besser and Hillary Brooke as the female lead foreshadows in fact the Abbott  Costello TV show of the early fifties as both would be regulars. Production values of 'Africa Screams' are bottomofthebarrel making any of the team's Universal flicks look like 'Gone With The Wind' by comparison. Well the good news is there are about 35 other Abbott  Costello films to watch instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "And they did make an awful lot of films starting with their debut in Universal's ONE NIGHT IN THE TROPICS 1940. And they did stay busy at Universal where along with Miss Deanna Durbin they managed to keep the Studio's doors open. But they did not go exclusive with Universal opting for some simultaneous work to be done for MetroGoldwynMayer Samuel Goldwyn StudiosUnited Artists as well as some independents.Of all their films we liked ABBOTT  COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN UniversalIntermnational 1948 the best but that my dear Schultz is another story and review. Following this would be both more simplified yet more complicated simplified because it provided a road map of where to start with an AC vehicle and where to go with it. As for the more complicated aspect of the equation it becomes a matter of how do we top this? With the release of Africa SCREAMS HuntingtonHartfordNassour PicturesUnited Artists 1949 it is obvious that all of this business learned on the AC Frankenstein Project was applied to the jungle project.First of all they started with a simple enough premise and storyline to boot. Bud  Lou work in a big Downtown Bookstore being kind of like a B. Dalton Bookseller or Kroch's  Brentano's here in Chicago. Lou entertains dreams of being a big time Jungle Guy sort of like costars Frank Buck and Clyde Beatty. In true comedy movie fashion the pair get tangled up with Treasure Hunter s Diana Emerson Hillary Brooke and her Henchmen Boots Wilson Buddy Baer  Grappler McCoy Max Baer.They wind up at her house having plenty of interplay with her Butler Harry Joe Besser and Safari Guide Gunner a Cokebottle spectacled Shemp Howard. They eventually get to be part of Miss Brooke's expedition by lying about knowledge of the map needed to find a treasure trove of diamonds worth a King's Ransom. They get into trouble with the local natives Bring 'Em Back Alive Mr. Frank Buck Himself and the World's Greatest Animal Trainer Mr. Clyde Beatty Himself.Lou also runs into a Gorilla who has apparent crush on him in an emotional lovelorn way not being a sort of Wrasslin' maneuver. And the censors objected to a female Gorilla feeling amorous about Costello so the production team made the Gorilla a Male! So our would be 'G' Rated today Saturday Afternoon Kids Matine special now has a Homosexual Bestiality relationship right out there in front of God and Everybody! Isn't it great to see how lucky we are in having an Arbiter of Public Taste and Morals looking out for us in the Movie Business! So in no surprise to anyone after all of the above has transpired and a Giant King KongMighty Joe Young knockoff Gorilla brings the action on the Dark Continent to a climactic crescendo the Comical Pair returns to New York where Lou has become some sort of Tycoon and Abbott some kind of blue collar worker in Costello's employ! THE END! A film of only about 80 minutes in length Africa SCREAMS is obviously a project conceived as an Abbott  Costello movie from the most embryonic of stages. While it is no masterpiece it is a top flight laugh maker which is what it is all about after all is said and done! The film is a crazyquilt of the most unusual collection of personalities involved in the production at all levels. First of all we have the cast which we have already acknowledged in previous paragraphs but here we go again. Other than Bud  Lou we have a relatively small not in size for the Baers cast. The just mentioned brothers Heavtyweights in the Prize Ring both provided the brawn heavies in the gang the muscle. The Livermore Larruper former Heavyweight Champion of The World Max Baer and his little brother the near giant Buddy Baer did just fine in performing their shtick with Bud  Lou. Both Hillary Brooke and Joe Besser were later regulars on THE ABBOTT AND COSTELLO SHOW CBS TV NBC TV 195253 with Hillary providing the glamour and Joe playing the ManBoy Stinky in the Buster Brown suit! And let's not forget the oldpro the comedians' comedian the maverick Stooge himself Shemp Howard as the blindasabat with or without the Harry Caraystyle glasses.In going beyond the cast we find a really strange conglomeration of people in different roles. Take for example Musical Director Walter Schumannhe of the DRAGNET theme and music for NIGHT OF THE HUNTER! We have Donald Crispi as Executive Producer! William Nassour Producer of SHEENA QUEEN OF THE JUNGLE TV Series 1956 was Ececutive in Charge. Norman Abbott Bud's nephew worked as dialogue coach. Perhaps the most unusual member to be involved is Huntington Hartford whose name is the same as his Production Company. Mr. Hartford whose family owned the Great Atlantic  Pacific Tea Company better known as the AP Food Stores once totaling about 15000 Supermarkets nationwide.Now in Public Domain Africa SCREAMS is easy to find being all over the place much like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE Liberty PicturesRKO Radio 1946 used to be.NOTE  These 2 guys were real life Jungle Bwanas Mr. Buck having been known as Bring 'Em Back Alive for some 25 years before this picture. Clyde Beatty had his own Circus was known as the World's Greatest Animal Trainer and had made many films before including 2 Serials portraying Himself.NOTE  This begs the question Who's pitchin' and who's catchin'?".

As for the more complicated aspect of the equation it becomes a matter of how do we top this? With the release of Africa SCREAMS HuntingtonHartfordNassour PicturesUnited Artists 1949 it is obvious that all of this business learned on the AC Frankenstein Project was applied to the jungle project.First of all they started with a simple enough premise and storyline to boot. Bud  Lou work in a big Downtown Bookstore being kind of like a B. Dalton Bookseller or Kroch's  Brentano's here in Chicago. Lou entertains dreams of being a big time Jungle Guy sort of like costars Frank Buck and Clyde Beatty. In true comedy movie fashion the pair get tangled up with Treasure Hunter s Diana Emerson Hillary Brooke and her Henchmen Boots Wilson Buddy Baer  Grappler McCoy Max Baer.They wind up at her house having plenty of interplay with her Butler Harry Joe Besser and Safari Guide Gunner a Cokebottle spectacled Shemp Howard. They eventually get to be part of Miss Brooke's expedition by lying about knowledge of the map needed to find a treasure trove of diamonds worth a King's Ransom. They get into trouble with the local natives Bring 'Em Back Alive Mr. Frank Buck Himself and the World's Greatest Animal Trainer Mr. Clyde Beatty Himself.Lou also runs into a Gorilla who has apparent crush on him in an emotional lovelorn way not being a sort of Wrasslin' maneuver. And the censors objected to a female Gorilla feeling amorous about Costello so the production team made the Gorilla a Male! So our would be 'G' Rated today Saturday Afternoon Kids Matine special now has a Homosexual Bestiality relationship right out there in front of God and Everybody! Isn't it great to see how lucky we are in having an Arbiter of Public Taste and Morals looking out for us in the Movie Business! So in no surprise to anyone after all of the above has transpired and a Giant King KongMighty Joe Young knockoff Gorilla brings the action on the Dark Continent to a climactic crescendo the Comical Pair returns to New York where Lou has become some sort of Tycoon and Abbott some kind of blue collar worker in Costello's employ! THE END! A film of only about 80 minutes in length Africa SCREAMS is obviously a project conceived as an Abbott  Costello movie from the most embryonic of stages. While it is no masterpiece it is a top flight laugh maker which is what it is all about after all is said and done! The film is a crazyquilt of the most unusual collection of personalities involved in the production at all levels. First of all we have the cast which we have already acknowledged in previous paragraphs but here we go again. Other than Bud  Lou we have a relatively small not in size for the Baers cast. The just mentioned brothers Heavtyweights in the Prize Ring both provided the brawn heavies in the gang the muscle. The Livermore Larruper former Heavyweight Champion of The World Max Baer and his little brother the near giant Buddy Baer did just fine in performing their shtick with Bud  Lou. Both Hillary Brooke and Joe Besser were later regulars on THE ABBOTT AND COSTELLO SHOW CBS TV NBC TV 195253 with Hillary providing the glamour and Joe playing the ManBoy Stinky in the Buster Brown suit! And let's not forget the oldpro the comedians' comedian the maverick Stooge himself Shemp Howard as the blindasabat with or without the Harry Caraystyle glasses.In going beyond the cast we find a really strange conglomeration of people in different roles. Take for example Musical Director Walter Schumannhe of the DRAGNET theme and music for NIGHT OF THE HUNTER! We have Donald Crispi as Executive Producer! William Nassour Producer of SHEENA QUEEN OF THE JUNGLE TV Series 1956 was Ececutive in Charge. Norman Abbott Bud's nephew worked as dialogue coach. Perhaps the most unusual member to be involved is Huntington Hartford whose name is the same as his Production Company. Mr. Hartford whose family owned the Great Atlantic  Pacific Tea Company better known as the AP Food Stores once totaling about 15000 Supermarkets nationwide.Now in Public Domain Africa SCREAMS is easy to find being all over the place much like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE Liberty PicturesRKO Radio 1946 used to be.NOTE  These 2 guys were real life Jungle Bwanas Mr. Buck having been known as Bring 'Em Back Alive for some 25 years before this picture. Clyde Beatty had his own Circus was known as the World's Greatest Animal Trainer and had made many films before including 2 Serials portraying Himself.NOTE  This begs the question Who's pitchin' and who's catchin'?";

Shemp despite sometimes being compared unfavorably with his brother Curly was a solid member of the trio for 10 years while his career apart from the Stooges never really amounted to much.In this movie we see both of those realities at work. Joe is in a word hilarious and steals virtually every scene he is in. It's not much of a stretch to say that this is as much his movie as Bud's and Lou's. Shemp on the other hand plays a nearsighted buffoon and his performance is nothing more than a running gag that involves him repeatedly running into things which quickly grows tiresome.Seeing Joe Besser's comedic talents on display here as well as in other settings like the postStooges Joey Bishop Show leaves one marveling at how one so hilariously funny could have flopped so completely as a Stooge.

	schema:reviewBody "This Abbott and Costello film has fallen into the public domain and I can see why. It's not just because it was made by a tiny studio but I just can't see why anyone would worry about renewing the copyright on this thing! It's a cheesy and silly mess...although I was surprised that in spite of many shortcomings it still managed to be entertaining...especially if you just turn off your brain and enjoy it for what it is and nothing more.As far as what is to like the most interesting thing about this film is the casting. I love odd and obscure film facts and this one sure offers some unusual casting. First it's the only pairing of Joe Besser who I hate and Shemp Howardboth of which were the 3rd Stooge. Following Curly Howard's stroke his oldest brother Shemp rejoined the Stooges he'd been with them on stage in their preHollywood days. After Shemp's death the Stooges had Besser take his rolenot realizing that he unfortunately is about as funny as cancer. How Besser and his very loud and effeminate shtick ever became a Stooge or regular on The Abbott and Costello Show has always amazed me. Second Max and Buddy Baer both were cast as thugs working for the evil woman Hillary Brooke. Max had been heavyweight boxing champion of the world and his son played Jethro on Green Acres. Buddy the larger of the two was a pro wrestler. Third the film features Frank Buck and Clyde Beatty as themselves. Both men were marketing geniuses. Buck was an adventurer and hunter who traveled the jungles making documentaries and fighting lions and the like before opening up his own zoo. Beatty was a big game hunter lion tamer and circus owner. This certainly is an unusual group of fellas! Another thing I liked is the evolution of Bud Abbott. In almost all the films he was a bit of a selfish jerk who used Lou whenever he could. However here he is way off the deep end with greedso much so that for once he got a lot of the laughs himself. His greedy disregard for others was very much like Daffy Duck's in ALI BABA BUNNY. In fact he is the best thing about this otherwise dreary film.The final plus is that the film ended well. The ending was very unusual and offered a nice change of pace for the team.What was not to like? Well where can I start? However instead of focusing on everything I'll just mention a few of the major problems. The biggest one is the use of a guy in a gorilla costumea very common and stupid convention of the 1940s and 50s. None of these looked the least bit convincing and this clich really sucks as it NEVER was funny...not even once. Even most 5 yearolds would immediately recognize the ruse so you can't be afraid or laugh when it appearsjust annoyed. I noticed that one reviewer gave this film a 9 or 10how can you do that when some guy in a motheaten gorilla costume plays a prominent place in this film?! The other main problem was that at times the film was well done but others it was annoyingly unfunny because the writing was at best inconsistent and the production looked like it was made for 582.34. One example of bad were having Besser say or do anythingplus his part was illdefined and unnecessary. This is somewhat the same with Brooke as she could have been interesting but her part was both illdefined and she just disappeared from the film. Another was how the plot seemed to morph into a remake of ROAD TO ZANZIBARcopying so much of this film yet giving it no credit whatsoever.Overall a very mixed bag that is mostly of value to film historians and film nuts like me though others might be entertained by the film despite its high amount of cheese. Still you can do better with almost any other Abbott and Costello film so I recommend you see them first.".

Be it on film or their Abbott and Costello Show on TV repeats of this 1952'54 program ran in NYC throughout the '60s for we baby boomers the team could do no wrong for me. Forty years later however I find that AC have lost much of their sparkle and charm although the best of the filmssuch as Buck Privates Keep 'Em Flying Pardon My Sarong and of course AC Meet Frankensteinremain wonderful entertainments for me. The team does not seem to have aged as well as some others I find the silent clowns Chaplin Keaton Lloyd and the Marx Brothers Laurel  Hardy W.C. Fields and the Stooges far funnier somehow today. A recent first viewing of the AC film Africa Screams released in 1949 has only served to bolster my opinion here. This is a remarkably stoopid film made on the supercheap that is fairly consistently UNfunny despite a terrific cast. In this one Lou plays a salesman of safari books and his character goes by the name of Stanley Livington oy. His buddy Buzz Johnson Abbott convinces pretty Diana Emerson Hillary Brooke that Stanley is a biggame hunter and safari guide even though Stanley had previously confessed that as a child he was scared by his piggy bank and that he was 15 before he ate his first animal cracker...double oy! and so off go the three along with Diana's thuggish accomplices played by reallife boxing brothers Max and Buddy Baer to hunt for the Orangutan gargantua in the African jungle. But wait...what the boys don't know is that Diana is actually an unscrupulous diamond hunter! This last is not really a spoiler this movie was BORN spoiled!Anyway baby boomers who grew up loving the sweet and lovely Hillary Brooke on The AC Show may be surprised to see her portray a bad girl here but actually Hillary had been known for playing bad girls for many years check her out in 1944's Ministry of Fear or 1946's Strange Impersonation for proof. She manages to escape from this wholly unfunny wreck with her dignity fairly intact. Reallife lion tamer Clyde Beatty is in the film his scenes with the big cats ARE pretty darn impressive as is reallife biggame hunter Frank Bring 'Em Back Alive Buck and they too emerge likable and unscathed. Not so for thencurrent Stooge Shemp Howard playing a Mr. Magoo type or for future Stooge Joe Besser playing Diana's butler and doing essentially a warmup performance for his Stinky Davis character on The AC Show a few years later. Africa Screams incidentally marked the first time that AC Brooke and Besser worked as a team and is the only time that Shemp and Besser appeared together.As may be expected the film dishes out all kinds of shenanigans with lions crocodiles zany monkeys Umgawaspouting cannibals and the seemingly inevitable man in a gorilla suit you can doubtless imagine. Instances of extreme stoopidity include that ridiculous native chant Stanley's use of an egg beater as a ship propeller and the film's protracted ending during which AC Diana and her thugs cannibals monkeys and that darn gorilla chase each other through the jungle. Homages to thenrecent films Mighty Joe Young and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre fail to engender any laffs either. Actually I only chuckled three or four times during the course of this 79minute film but they were more chuckles of disbelief at the inanity on screen than chuckles of actual mirth. AND strange to say Bud struck me as more amusing than Lou in this outing. Go figure. Truly Africa Screams is a movie for hardcore AC historians only and possibly kids up to age 6 and even THEY might be rolling their eyes. The lousy print quality of this Westlake Video DVD doesn't help matters either. Y'know it just struck me that this film makes the 1963 Bob Hope vehicle Call Me Bwana look like high art! To quote Buzz as he watches Stanley jump into a crocodileinfested river What a belly flop!".

She manages to escape from this wholly unfunny wreck with her dignity fairly intact. Reallife lion tamer Clyde Beatty is in the film his scenes with the big cats ARE pretty darn impressive as is reallife biggame hunter Frank Bring 'Em Back Alive Buck and they too emerge likable and unscathed. Not so for thencurrent Stooge Shemp Howard playing a Mr. Magoo type or for future Stooge Joe Besser playing Diana's butler and doing essentially a warmup performance for his Stinky Davis character on The AC Show a few years later. Africa Screams incidentally marked the first time that AC Brooke and Besser worked as a team and is the only time that Shemp and Besser appeared together.As may be expected the film dishes out all kinds of shenanigans with lions crocodiles zany monkeys Umgawaspouting cannibals and the seemingly inevitable man in a gorilla suit you can doubtless imagine. Instances of extreme stoopidity include that ridiculous native chant Stanley's use of an egg beater as a ship propeller and the film's protracted ending during which AC Diana and her thugs cannibals monkeys and that darn gorilla chase each other through the jungle. Homages to thenrecent films Mighty Joe Young and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre fail to engender any laffs either. Actually I only chuckled three or four times during the course of this 79minute film but they were more chuckles of disbelief at the inanity on screen than chuckles of actual mirth. AND strange to say Bud struck me as more amusing than Lou in this outing. Go figure. Truly Africa Screams is a movie for hardcore AC historians only and possibly kids up to age 6 and even THEY might be rolling their eyes. The lousy print quality of this Westlake Video DVD doesn't help matters either. Y'know it just struck me that this film makes the 1963 Bob Hope vehicle Call Me Bwana look like high art! To quote Buzz as he watches Stanley jump into a crocodileinfested river What a belly flop!";

	schema:reviewBody "Some of Abbott and Costello's later films sure seemed like they were aimed more at kids than a wider audience. Some were obvious kids films JACK AND THE BEANSTALK and some merely featured rather juvenile humor that most adults would find less entertaining. While I enjoyed watching ABBOTT AND COSTELLO IN THE FOREIGN LEGION a few minutes ago I sure enjoyed it much more when I was a little kidafter all this was the target audience. Let me give you a few examples. First the fish with the dentures a gag by the way that the Three Stooges also used. I just can't imagine an adult laughing at the plastic catfish in this gag. Second while they were a bit funny the mirage scenes were also pretty lowbroweven by Abbott and Costello standards. Yet despite all this the film manages to do a decent job of entertainingeven with its rather modest pretensions.The film begins with Bud and Lou as wrestling promoters. When their star stomps off to return to his home in the North African desert the boys follow to try to convince him to return. Unfortunately they walk right into the middle of a plot by the Sheik Douglass Dambrille to kill them. The boys take refuge in a foreign legion recruiting station and the rest is history.As legionnaires the two are pretty sad. Bud's in his mid50s and Lou is....Lou. Although they are awful in their new jobs they accidentally bump into adventure after adventure. First they discover who the traitor is within the regiment. Next they get lost in the desert and almost die. Next there is a wild and crazy ending where they foil the plot to destroy the legion. And finally they get to go home and live happily ever after especially Lou.None of this is terrible though not much is especially great or inspired either. Overall it's a bit of a time passeralbeit a very good one. A couple of the highlights of the film include seeing Tor Johnson in a role many years before he shot to fame for his magnetic performance in PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. Another is a cheap but funny line by Lou She's either a very ugly woman or a very pretty monster.Inoffensive and I'm sure the kids will love it. And if you've ever seen Abbott and Costello's LOST IN A HAREM then you have a general idea what this film is about as they both star Dambrille in very similar roles and the laughs are sometimes very similarand both were clearly shot on sound stages and not on location giving them both an echo that is noticeable from time to time.".

Some were obvious kids films JACK AND THE BEANSTALK and some merely featured rather juvenile humor that most adults would find less entertaining. While I enjoyed watching ABBOTT AND COSTELLO IN THE FOREIGN LEGION a few minutes ago I sure enjoyed it much more when I was a little kidafter all this was the target audience. Let me give you a few examples. First the fish with the dentures a gag by the way that the Three Stooges also used. I just can't imagine an adult laughing at the plastic catfish in this gag.

The intro is great especially Bud Abbott who shows passion that he would only show periodically in the team's later years.  The chemistry is good in the scenes in Africa until the boys join the legion when the movie stalls slightly.  There is a funny bit with Costello manning a machine gun and a hilarious miscounting scene that is the best bit in the film.  Some great pro wrestling nonsense and a chaotic ending finish the film.

	schema:reviewBody "I liked it. If you never saw another AC film I'll bet you would like it's craziness. This was the first film the boys did after Lou's relapse of relapsing fever and gall bladder surgery. The story begins in a Brooklyn wrestling rehearsal between the giant AbdullahWee Willie Davis and another. Abbott decides they should also wrestle a bit with Lou who gets slammed around and pounced upon for an extending period. The repeated pounding of his head into the canvas was particularly brutal. Apparently it was really Lou taking this punishment not his brother who was often a stunt double for him. Lou must have had a thick skull with all the head hits over the years. Abdullah is unhappy that he is scripted to lose this fight as he has never lost a professional fight. Thus he's going back to his tribe in Algeria leaving the boys holding the bag for his 5000. long term contract.Why didn't they just change the script for him to win?? AC board a ship for Algiers and ask around if anyone knows an Abdullah. This disturbs some of the residents who are members of his tribe.AxmannWalter Slezak a traitorous Legionnaire sergeant is talking to bad man Sheik HamudDouglass Dumbrille and others about a plan to kill construction workers building a railroad. Next some menacinglooking Arabs with knives are intimidating Lou. AC try to evade them by entering a room full of slave girls. Later they encounter a slave girl market where Lou unknowingly buys 6 girls for an exorbitant price. The boys skedaddle to the end of a line of marching Legionnaires who take them to headquarters where Sgt. Axmann tricks them into signing up for a 5 year tour of duty in the Legion. As in Buck Privates Lou is extremely inept in basic training yet is not dismissed even when he accidentally turns a nonstop machine gun on the compound with no idea how to stop it. Some bullets knock a bunch of coconuts down which knock out a bunch of Legionaries. This whole segment is hilarious. At a desert camp Lou's camel gets loose and runs away at night. Incidentally as usual Hollywood used 2 hump Camels instead of the proper one hump variety appropriate for North Africa and the Middle East. Meanwhile Sheik Hamud's Arabs attack and kill all the legionnaires save for the absent AC who are starving and in serious need of water. They see several enticing mirages before finding an actual oasis where they refresh and take a nap. Soon a party of Arabs come along but does not see them. One loses his false teeth when he takes a drink. They leave and the boys decide to fish to satisfy their hunger. Abbott catches a few small ones but when Costello washes them off a big fish with the Arab's false teeth snaps them up then squirts him in the face. Hilarious! This would seem an adaptation of the squirting oyster in Lou's oyster soup in Abbott and Costello Meet the Coeds.The Arabs return capture the boys and take them to the encampment of Sheik Hamud where it's pronounced they must die. How? By being beat to death by Abdallah and another bruiser. Abdallah whispers that he won't harm them as he needs them to get back to Brooklyn to escape having to marry the Sheik's obese daughter. During their fight a general freeforall erupts and the boys run out of the tent. They return in Arab garb while 2 Arabs are wearing their clothes. Axmann has arrived in a jeep with Nicole DuprePatricia Medina whom the boys have met several times as an Arab woman. Axmann says she is actually a French intelligence spyand thus must die?. They plus Abdullah drive away in Axmann's jeep with Arabs on horses pursuing them. They come upon a deserted Legion compound and open the gate. The Legion arrives and fires at them thinking they are Arabs. Then the Arabs arrive and gallop into the compound. The boys close the gate so they are trapped inside. I will stop here and let you see the conclusion for yourselves.".

A great gag occurs when he hallucinates that a newsboy is selling newspapers in the desert. When Lou asks him how he got there the newsboy answers that he got stuck with a bad corner. The rest of the film has the usual slapstick nonsense and tired old gags about oil Sheiks and harems. On the whole only worth seeing if your brain is stuck in idle or stupid.".

When it's suspected that radiation from nuclear weapons testing in French Polynesia may have instead produced the monster biological radiation specialist Dr. Nick Tatopoulos Matthew Broderick is called to the scene. While investigating the monster's path of destruction a new sighting arrivesjust off the coast of New York City! It's no secret that Godzilla has been much maligned. Even Fangoria editor Tony Timpone stated in an editorial that he thought it sucked and he's usually willing to give movies the benefit of the doubt. The reasons why director Roland Emmerich's version of Godzilla is hated are as varied as people stating opinions. But I tend to think that there is also a strong bandwagon effect with this film that will be tempered by time. There are already signs of a number of people giving it a second look and lessening the severity of their criticism.The chief complaint seems to come from a very vocal but relatively small crowd of fanboy puriststhey dislike that Godzilla is different here. In the Japanese films made by the Toho production company Godzilla is a guy in a rubber suit who stomps on models of buildings and such. He tends to lumber as irrelevant military attacks on him provide pretty fireworks. Most Godzilla films feature him fighting some other monster professional wrestling style and Godzilla arbitrarily falls down and gets back up as he is attacked and attacks with various death rays from his mouth eyes etc. Now that might sound like I don't like the typical Godzilla film but that's not true. I like them quite a bit but a big part of the reason why is that most of them are very cheesy. I'm a fan of bizarre cheesecamp and you get tons of that in Godzilla films.But I'm not a purist. To me there's no good reason why Emmerich's Godzilla needs to be similar to the Toho incarnations which in fact are often quite different from and inconsistent with each other too. At this point I see Godzilla more as a recurring character typethink of the various instantiations of Dracula or Frankenstein throughout the 20th Century. The Toho films can't really be seen as chapters in a single long story. But whether their arguments are wrong or not the fanboy purists are at least noisy and prolific and too many people are followers.If Emmerich would have given us a guy in a rubber suit acting just like the Toho Godzillas not Godzilla with the typical gobbledygook of a Toho script this film would have bombed even worse if we can call a 100 million dollar film that made a profit a bomb and the fanboys would have still found something to complain about. Even though I love the Toho Godzilla films too we can't deny that they do not tend to be bestsellers on video in the U.S. despite the fact that they're readily available for purchase.So what Emmerich gives us instead is an epic expensivelooking film that spans a number of genres features more coherent dialogue and subplots than a typical Toho Godzilla film and showcases a redesigned mostly cgi cast of monsters where Godzilla looks and behaves much more like a real giant mutant lizard. For those of us who are not purists who do not care if our opinions match the majority and who evaluate films on all or their technical and artistic levels it's difficult to deny that Godzilla has many merits.For example the cinematography in this film is gorgeous. The sound design is superb and the soundtrack score and songs works well with the film. All of the action sequences and they comprise a large percentage of the film are expertly stagedEmmerich doesn't resort to darkness blurcams and overly quick cuts like many other directors. It's always easy to follow the narrative during action scenes it's always easy to see what's going on and it's always coherent. That goes for the nonaction scenes toothe entire film is ingeniously designed in terms of the progression from one sequence to another. Also the cgi is amazingit's often difficult to tell where it stops and mechanicalsmodels begin.But the story is great too. Broderick's Tatopoulos is an attractive antihero a nerdish scientist who solve dilemmas with his professional knowledge. The other hero is Jean Reno as Philippe Roache a humorously enigmatic French insurance agent. The obligatory romantic subplot involving Tatopoulos and Audrey Timmonds Maria Pitillo surprisingly avoids clichs and Timmonds provides a launching pad for an alltoohonest satire of the media.Satire is high up on Emmerich's agenda. Godzilla not only satirizes the media but the military New YorkNew Yorkers film critics and even monster movies. While the film is simultaneously giving us a lot of genresscifi horror adventure war film drama etc. the most unexpected motif is the almost cartoonish spooflike humor. Godzilla is more frequently laughoutloud funny that anyone expected it to be. It's not just oneliners and overt jokes although those are certainly present but the amped up intentional absurdity of situations such as the final taxi cab chase.Even if you think that Godzilla has some internal problems as an artwork and I agree that there is a slight clunkiness in parts of the narrative flowit caused me to subtract a point there's no way it deserves the trashing it's received so far. This is at least a wellmade film on a technical level and if you have any taste for slightly campy scifimonster flicks you should find much to enjoy here.".

This film was exactly what I was hoping it would be at the time. Sure it certainly wasn't as charming or as funny as the films I loved as a kid but it was a lot of fun. I loved the action scenes the look of the monster was crazy to me and the plot was simple enough for a first time viewer to get right into. Seeing it again 10 years later I had the same reaction. My opinion of this film hasn't changed one bit. I guess everybody's complaints stem from how this has no charm or any kind of attempt at being cute or original. I guess that's understandable but I still don't see what everybody's problem is. This was supposed to be a fun exciting and action packed thrill ride. That's all it is no more no less. I personally think that it succeeds at what it achieved to be perfectly. Matthew Broderick may not exactly be an action hero but his character sure was quirky and funny. Jean Reno was as good as usual.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been almost five years since this film came out back in 1998. I can remember the very first TV Spot on television around New Years. As a HUGE Godzilla fan I was excited to say the least. And I must tell you when I saw it when it finally came out I wasn't dissapointed and to this day I still feel the same way.It's a darn shame that this film gets blasted like it does. It shows me that the majority of the people and Godzilla fans that take the time to write reviews for films probably don't know what they are talking about when they talk of America's Godzilla.There are a couple of main issues critics and Godzilla fans have with the film. The story and the monster itself 'Godzilla'.If you look back at all of the original Japanese Godzilla flicks you aren't going to find a great not to mention BELIEVABLE story or plot. I realize this even being a fan of all things Godzilla. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's 'Godzilla' atleast in my opinion had the audience believing what was going on up on the screen. And if the story was slightly dull to some of you you should let it pass. Remember what 'Godzilla' is about afterall.And what was wrong with the monster itself Godzilla? Nothing. If you get two action figures one being a model of the original Godzilla from the Japanese series and a model of the new American Godzilla you will find differences but both are remarkably alike in alot of ways. They both have the spikes gigantic size and famous roar. The major differences being the skin color face and longer legs. I loath it when people bring up how they shouldn't have changed Godzilla's looks. I mean I love the old Godzilla look it may be silly to some but to me it's still cool. But it would NOT have worked for this film at ALL. If they had made the American version with a creature that had big 'googily' eyes and flying around on his tail kicking monsters it would have ended up being a laughfest at the theaters.What the American 'Godzilla' brings us is a believable monster that has the spirit and characteristics of the original that satisfies the audience. It was just more realistic. Shouldn't we have expected that? Devlin and Emmerich came up with a monster that was realistic. Something the creators of the original attempted at doing but were limited to rubber suits. Something the Japanese audience accepts but the American audience will not. It's sad that most Godzilla fans and critics do not understand this.I personally believe that the majority of the general audience ENJOYED this film. It's just the critical blasting from G Fans and Critics that got alot of attention unfortunately and therefore this gets labeled as a 'bad' film. It's sad really that people can't enjoy this film.This is one of my favorite DVD's to plug in. It's Big Loud and Fun. And although we've had lots of great films with tons of Special Effects there's nothing quite like it.So take a look at it be open and I'm sure you will enjoy the fantastic popcorn entertainment known as GODZILLA.".

I went to this movie to be entertained and I wasn't disappointed. It's loud it's quasiscary it had explosions and giant lizards it had cheesy characters with cheesy names and all sorts of good stuff you expect from a fun nobrainer movie. C'mon were its predecessors any better? No sex no graphic violence unless you count the poor thing's demise at the end minimal profanityI was able to take my daughter to see it and not be embarrassed! Today you can pop it in your DVD player or VCR on a rainy Saturday make some microwave popcorn just keep your pet lizard away from it! and kill about 90 minutes with the family. The only part I had a problem with was they made the beasty so personable so NICE it never INTENTIONALLY kills anyone y'know I couldn't help but feel sorry for it when it died at the end. They even gave it KIDS for Pete's sake! As a fellow parent I actually sympathized when it found out they trashed the Garden. I was hoping for a sequel with the hatching egg at the end but sad to say that got scrapped. Anyway my final word is Get over it folks! It wasn't MEANT to be taken seriously! Once you get past that you can enjoy it for the cheap themeparkride it was meant to be. I love it!".

Now as I watch this movie again at about the first time Godzilla takes the large batch of fish I find that the movie is a very good attempt at story telling.However after watching it with a friend in college a friend who lived in New York for much of his earlier life I learned a few things about the movie that makes me think that it's one very well written continuity error.It seems to me that the writers tried to make New York a very fictional place either that or perhaps some of them had never even been to the City that Never Sleeps. One example of this would be the layout of the city itself like when the helicopters are chasing the big guy between the buildings. The city looked more like a maze rather than the grid of buildings that it really is. Perhaps the writers and miniature set designers did this on purpose to give the helicopters a sense of dread should they get lost. New York after all is a very big place where anyone can lose their way if they're not careful.Another part would be when Godzilla jumps into the Hudson river and encounters the two or three nuclear submarines ready to blast it with torpedoes. It depicts the river as being as deep as parts of the Atlantic when in reality it's actually only about 15 feet deep. Don't get me wrong it's a cool idea especially since the Japanese Godzilla always emerged from the depths of the ocean. Perhaps it was to make him feel more at home or to show his true amphibious nature by swimming through the river like an eel.Then there's the final scene where Godzilla's chasing our heroes over the Brooklyn Bridge. I'm not sure whether the big guy actually weighs less than he looks or not but anything that big would have done more damage to the bridge than just shaking it around a bit. One step on the Brooklyn Bridge by that thing would have torn it apart. I can understand though that it would be the only thing that could tangle it up for the F18's to shoot it dead but a more realistic method of entanglement would be for it to run down the river and slam into it like a tennis court net. But then again just the fact that they maid the river about a league deep would make it hard for it to run along it.Godzilla's size comes into perspective once again when our heroes find the nest in Madison Square Garden where the big guy's laid his eggs. I know the place is big but there is no way he could fit perfectly into the basket ball arena without doing anything more than ripping the floor out. The ceiling and roof would have been completely demolished and the halls would have been smashed through.Keep in mind folks that this is the point of view of someone who's only seen New York through one form of media or the other so if there's anything anyone wants to add to the list of errors than just submit them to my account.In all fairness I still find this to be a good attempt at story telling. I hold to my rating of 810 for writing and production but only a 210 for continuity.".

As badly made those films were they were still incredibly fun because of all the camp. It was just a good time to watch those movies and Godzilla was just freaky looking and scared the heck out of you. So naturally the men who created the big time special effects movies like Independence Day and Stargate would naturally try and recreate the gigantic lizard and you guessed it put him in today's New York City. Now who are we going to rely on to save us? Arnold Schwartzenegger Syvester Stallone Bruce Willis Jackie Chan? Nope Ferris Bueller er I mean Matthew Broderick. He plays a nerd in this movie so who better to save us? Godzilla is barely recongnizable as he is just a CGI love fest where it seems that the creators were not even close to what Godzilla really looked like in the old films. Oh this was a bad movie.A Japanese fishing ship is attacked by an unseen giant monster that attacks from below the water only one sailor survives. Traumatized he is questioned in a hospital by a French scientist as to what he saw. His only reply is Godzilla. Dr. Nick Tatopoulos an NRC scientist researching the effects of radiation on earth worms is interrupted by the arrival of an agent of the U.S. State Department. He is sent to Panama escorted by the military to observe the wreckage of the recovered Japanese fishing ship and a set of massive dinosaurlike footprints in the grassy soil. The Frenchman is also there observing the scene and introduces himself as an insurance agent. Aboard a military aircraft Tatopolous identifies skin samples he recovered as belonging to an animal unknown to science. He dismisses the military's theory that the creature is a reawakened dinosaur theorising that its origins in French Polynesia make it a mutant created by nuclear testing. An old man is seen fishing on the dock. He takes a bite from his fishing rod and a big wave comes toward him after a few minutes of trying to pull in his line. The big wave happens to be Godzilla and he emerges from the dock. Godzilla then travels to Manhattan and creates havoc in the city killing dozens of people. Godzilla is revealed to be a gigantic bipedal lizard that towers over much of the New York skyline. The city is evacuated and the military attempt to kill Godzilla first luring it out with a huge pile of fish the creature's staple diet. It takes the bait but is scared off by small arms fire but oddly enough it's just not working on the giant lizard.That's pretty much a good enough summary of the movie there's more in the movie than that but it's kind of pointless to mention as this movie was just pointless to make. It's just badly written the special effects are way over the top and obvious to anyone and the actors are just so out of place it's insane. Now is this the worst movie of all time? I wouldn't say so but it is just a bad movie over all I wouldn't really recommend it. Godzilla just doesn't belong in America especially since our government is stupid enough to constantly loose a gigantic lizard in NEW YORK CITY! So I wouldn't recommend this film it's just a stupid way of killing time you could be doing more useful things like the dishes.210".

	schema:headline " Godzilla in New York";
	schema:reviewBody "Many Godzilla purists rejected this CGIbased reinterpretation of the story 23 in the series but it is not a bad kaiju outing in its own right. The Toho release Godzilla vs. Destoroyah 1995 preceding Emmerich's version continued the trend toward improbable monsters newage subplots and selfrighteous greenery and I found the US version to be a refreshing return to the original concept humanity vs. a single destructive monster born of radiation. Typical of Emmerich's unsubtle style everything is very big Godzilla or very numerous e.g. helicopters and the human drama of the 1954 original which treats the monster's destructive rampage more as a tragedy than an adventure is replaced by lightweight shtick primarily revolving around the Roger Ebertlookalike mayor apparently an Emmerich injoke. Godzilla itself is IMO quite well done with a very different look from the original reflecting 'iguana' rather than 'dinosaur' origins and the production has fun with the sheer scale of the monster. The opening credit scenes which establish Godzilla's genesis are extremely good and the film builds well from there to the arrival of the monster on the shores of Manhattan Island. The cast is fine Mathew Broderick's playing the scientist who seems to always guess correctly and Maria Pitillo and Hank Azaria as intrepid reporters both tropes familiar to anyone who has watched the Japanese films. Jean Reno is great as the French secretservice agent trying to ensure that the role France's nuclear tests in creating the current disaster remains unknown and he and his team have best lines in the film riffing on both Gallic unflappability and the challenges of running a clandestine operation in America. Within the context of the film a general plausibility is maintained other than reconciling Godzilla's size and its ability to fit in the New York subway system until the 'third act' an overdone and ridiculous chase scene that is by far the weakest part of the film. Future Japanese entries in the Godzilla franchise make the occasional amusing dig at Emmerich's fisheating version of the iconic kaiju but overall I thought that the film was a worthy effort at 'Americanising' Toho's famous monster and liked the film more than most viewers based on IMDB and certainly more than most Godzillaphiles.".

	onyx:emotionText "Many Godzilla purists rejected this CGIbased reinterpretation of the story 23 in the series but it is not a bad kaiju outing in its own right. The Toho release Godzilla vs. Destoroyah 1995 preceding Emmerich's version continued the trend toward improbable monsters newage subplots and selfrighteous greenery and I found the US version to be a refreshing return to the original concept humanity vs. a single destructive monster born of radiation. Typical of Emmerich's unsubtle style everything is very big Godzilla or very numerous e.g. helicopters and the human drama of the 1954 original which treats the monster's destructive rampage more as a tragedy than an adventure is replaced by lightweight shtick primarily revolving around the Roger Ebertlookalike mayor apparently an Emmerich injoke. Godzilla itself is IMO quite well done with a very different look from the original reflecting 'iguana' rather than 'dinosaur' origins and the production has fun with the sheer scale of the monster.

It's better despite its rainy flaws. The effects are worth watching the monster behaves in the way you would expect Godzilla to behave. There wasn't enough mention of its nuclear origins and warnings but the destruction is what you probably expected to see in at least one of the Toho films and did not get to see.

I haven't seen that many crocodile or in this case alligator attack movies but even I could see that it wasn't a real gator. No CGI either. In the first movie it was somewhat menacing and threatening but in this sequel it just doesn't scare enough.The attack scenes are still predictable. They removed the jawslike tune from the prequel making it even more dull.The acting is not bad nor good. It works for this type of film.What I don't understand is how the sewers sometimes look like a swamp. Lots of reed and stuff. It's confusing to say the least.Watch this only if you have got nothing better to do.

I actually found this a fun tongueincheek little monster movie that works around the low budget to deliver a pacy entertaining film with a strong script to recommend it. It's closer to PIRANHA than JAWS in tone with the usual stock characters showing up the rookie cop the greedy property developer the ignorant mayor and the dedicated law enforcer on the tail of the beast literally in this case.The worst thing about the film is the alligator itself. It's a combination of stock footage from the original film and an absolutely rubbishy pair of rubber jaws pushed at the intended victims. The poor FX and distant lack of bloodshed make the various attack sequences a real letdown but that's okay because what happens when the alligator isn't onscreen is more interesting than it is.The clichd characters are brought to life by a wonderful ensemble cast of familiar faces. Joseph Bologna is well cast as the likable cop doing his best to catch the best I also liked Woody Brown as the young inexperienced squarejawed hero. Dee Wallace Stone THE HOWLING finds herself wasted as the cop's wife with nothing to do but the stunning Holly Gagnier has more fun playing the mayor's daughter. The scene chewing is left to a pair of dedicated Bmovie veterans.First up is Steve Railsback TURKEY SHOOT excellent as the utterly repulsive villain of the piece second we have Richard Lynch playing one of those halfcrazed redneck hunter types. Other familiar faces include Brock Peters as the black chief of police Jason Voorhees himself Kane Hodder as an alligator hunter and Voyo Goric a Russian villain in RAMBO FIRST BLOOD PART 2 as a henchman. This isn't a great film by any means but I found it a more than entertaining effort considering the budget.".

His wife Christine DeeWallace Stone a chemist tells him that one of the most recent clues to the case is involved with an animal of some sort but she can't solve it herself. More investigated finds that Brown is trying to scare away the residents for the real estate he is building and he formulates a theory that a crocodile or alligator is behind the attacks. No one believes him and the mayor Bill Daily places him under house arrest. After escaping he seeks out the residents around the lake who are concerned that Vincent Brown is a cancer on the area. Another attack brings Hodges after it more determined than before especially since Brown brought in a special team led by Hawk Hawkins Richard Lynch and his partners Billy Boy Kane Hodder and Paul Jon Paul Jones to catch the alligator and have failed. Finally teaming up together everyone works to get the alligator out of the sewers and are able to kill it.The Good News What can I say I really like this movie. There were several things that I liked about it. First of all the action in the film is actually exciting. The first confrontation with the gator in the swamps is a great scene that I love to watch over and over again. The fake gator may have killed it a bit but it is still a very enjoyable scene. What helps is that the film plays with the fact that it is a campy movie and never tries to overplay that. What really helps the film is that the campiness plays into scenes that it allows the action to be overthetop. With all the scenes that feature the alligator we do get to see a few great scenes. Every single scene in the sewer chasing the gator is a pretty cool scene. The gator's assault at the end of the film is pretty cool to watch as well. It does have a lot of vicious looking attacks as well. The first time we see the gator swimming in the lake and it's landing on the beach are all pretty chilling. The film even has some good suspense scenes written in as well. When the gator first appears in the sewers stalking the two cops it is a pretty chilling moment. The attack on the winos in the middle of a darkened alley lit only by torchlight is the film's most chilling moment and is definitely it's high point. The final scene in the lake is also pretty terrifying but it could've been handled a lot differently than it was.The Bad News The many scenes set in the nightclub with the wrestlers were a total waste of time. It did nothing to the plot of the film and the moves were so relatively standard that it didn't impress me that much. The only thing it did was provide the film with some much needed length and even still it doesn't stretch the film that much. What really hurt this film the most is that the alligator itself isn't very menacing. The change between the real one and the fake one is so obvious that only a real unintelligent person would recognize it as a real monster. The change between them is so great that not being able to tell them apart is unfathomable. The real one is naturally a real one but the fake one doesn't even move a single iota. The tail doesn't even move when it swims in the lake at the end a real letdown considering how other films have gone to such great lengths to correct that small flaw. The film would also be a lot better without the really tacked on ending. The real ending isn't really all that spectacular and it left completely dissatisfied.The Final Verdict Ignoring the fact that the killer monster who does have a lot of screen time is very fake and a rushed ending that never really matches what the rest of film sets up this is a pretty good film considering the first one is a bona fide classic. Good for chasing away rainy days with your drunken buddies or for those like to watch a movie and ridicule it at the same time.Rating PG13 Graphic Violence Adult Language and children and animals in jeopardy of the alligator".

The ending sequence with the heroes trapped in the water with the gator is rather exciting but there is not much else.

I mean the first one is just so much fun  and really one of the few older killercroc type of films done right  and this sequel carrying the MUTATION subtitle plus starring both Steve Railsback and Richard Lynch I mean... Can it honestly be that bad?Straight up I can't really call it a bad movie. It's not badly put together and further more it has all the necessary elements to even make it a Bmovie in the tradition of JAWS type of flick. We got a killer alligator loose in some city pond eating people left and right who are unknowingly invading its territory which extends to the sewers again. There's the protagonist detective Joseph Bologna a rather forgettable actor running around aware of the problem but believed by noone. Dee Wallace yipii! plays his wife and even with her supporting role she proves again that she's the best actress in the whole film. We have Railsback playing a greedy corrupt man with power who plans a carnival near the pond which he refuses to cancel. And when he's informed of the alligator problem he tries to deal with it in a hushhush way calling in Richard Lynch as a bounty hunter together with Kane Hodder as his brother no less. And finally our killer alligator who sadly enough doesn't look mutated at all but at least it kind of looks the same as the one in the first film.So what went wrong with this film? All the ingredients really are present. The script even tries to inject some of the same type of black humor the first one had so at least the filmmakers tried to make a sequel in the same spirit. It even has something that looks like a decent climax involving the pond and a helicopter and all. But the problem is None of it works. This film supposedly has everything and even tries pretty hard but it all just doesn't feel right. It just doesn't come together and click like the first film did. Hard to explain it really. Plus the alligator gets a fair amount of screen time but it never does anything you want to see it do. People should be getting munched or at least ripped to shreds but I can't recall any memorable death scenes. I remember Kane Hodder getting stuck in its mouth but that's about it.When compared to the first ALLIGATOR from 1980 this sequel really is subpar for reasons I can't even pinpoint exactly. But as a standalone as it has little ties with the first one aside some minor bits of alligator footage being reused killeralligator flick from the 90's  and we all know what that means it's just about moderately entertaining. Watch it if you can't resist it just like I did. Otherwise skip it and save yourself the inevitable disappointment.".

And to think its rumored that this goes all the way to Alligator 9oh boy this just puts the first to shame.Well anyway nice try but I will stick to Alligator thank you.  Long live Sayle.";

	schema:headline " The sequel to the original Alligator is actually not as bad I thought it was going to be.....IT'S MUCH WORSE!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "The film begins with the local villain Vincent 'Vinnie' Brown Steve Railsback personally overseeing the illegal dumping of toxic waste into the city sewers that is produced by his company 'Future Chemicals'. The same night two men named Pedro Ramon Estevez and Victor Thomas Rosales Jr. are fishing in a river next to a sewer outlet. Something watches them from afar hidden among the reeds. They are attacked and pulled underwater a severed leg slowly sinks to the bottom. The next morning the two men are reported missing Detective David Hodges Joseph Bologna takes a special interest as he personally knows the family. Also that morning the severed leg is found where Pedro and Victor were last seen. Hodges thinks the two incidents may be connected. The local pathologist Buckley Norris suggests that the mans leg was severed by a large animal and that traces of saliva were found on the bite marks on the leg. He says he has sent it over to the university so Christine Hodges Dee WallaceStone who just happens to be Hodges wife by a complete coincidence of course you understand. While discussing the case over dinner that night Mr. and Mrs. Hodges jump to various implausible conclusions and decide that a giant alligator is running around the sewers. Chief Clarence Speed Brock Peters doesn't believe him but says he can continue investigating the case and let him know what he comes up with. Inconviently Brown is planning a carnival to promote his crooked beachside property dealings that are currently in the balance. Hodges tries to talk with Brown and get him to cancel the carnival Brown refuses and leans on the city's mayor Anderson Bill Daily to have Hodges arrested and taken off the case. The alligator kills an old wino called Oatis and his friend Henry Carmen Filpi barely manages to escape. But Henry does escape and reports it to the authorities Hodges now has proof. Brown then calls in Hawk Hawkins Richard Lynch and his posse of men to track down the alligator and kill it. Meanwhile Hodges isn't going to give up that easily and along with a rookie cop named Rich Harmon Woody brown the mayor's rather attractive daughter Sheri Anderson Holly Gagnier and just so it's a family affair his wife Christine sets about killing the mutated alligator themselves and try to prevent a bloodbath at the carnival which just happens to be right next to a large lake.Directed by Jon Hess I absolutely hated this film. I challenge anyone to name anything good about this film. Hess fails to inject any humour pace momentum or excitement into the film. He directs it like a lowbudget T.V. film everything about this film says the filmmakers just didn't care about the finished product. The ending is awful the alligator just walks through the carnival and people run away and that's it until Hodges arrives. The script by Curt Allen is boring slow predictable and is full of padding that really didn't need to be there. It does however have a couple of mildly amusing lines of dialogue in it like when the slimy Brown is talking to the mayor's pretty young daughter and says your a child stick with me and I'll make you a woman he knows how to charm the ladies! Henry lovingly reflects on his mates death by the alligator and says Oatis was my friend he didn't deserve to be a tooth pick!. Those are two of the better written scenes as well. I thought Micheal Douglas lookalike Bologna made for a reasonably likable hero even if he was to old to be running around with a rocket launcher! Railsback reaches a career low here and is criminally underused throughout. The special effects are awful the alligator itself isn't in the film that much and when you see how bad and unconvincing the puppet effects are you'll understand why there's no blood gore violence nudity or bad language either. Can someone tell me what the point of this film existing is? Words can barely describe how much I hate this film Jon Hess and Curt Allen if your reading this you owe me 90 minutes of my life back! Avoid at all costs and if you do decide to watch it just don't say you weren't warned!".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me state right off the bat to all fans out there that I did not like the original 1980 film Alligator. As a matter of fact I did not like it at all. I rarely use this word beginning with an H but I hated the first Alligator. To some it's a funny creature feature satire. To me it was a total bore and that's too bad for me because I love the creature feature genre and was really looking forward to that film which has gone on to become sort of a cult classic.Anyway enough about the first movie. If you want to know why I detested it see my review for it. We're here to talk about its 1991 sequel unimaginatively titled Alligator II The Mutation. And it's even more unimaginative than its already unimaginative predecessor. It's an even more typical sewer alligator picture. Now keep in mind I have not seen this movie in ages and I have no desire to see it again. What I do remember of Alligator II was that it was a complete bore with special effects that were barely more competent than the movie that preceded it by eleven years.The plot was something like Jaws set on a lakeside. There's a carnival going on by the shores of some urban body of water. A detective Joseph Bologna becomes convinced there's a killer alligator loose in the water but a greedy businessman is determined to keep the attractions open nonetheless. Anyway boaters and swimmers decide to go for a dip or ride in the water and are never seen again and then finally...I must stress the word finally because Alligator II is a really tough film to sit through. It's not particularly gruesome it's just a complete bore partially because it's so predictable. What also gets a kick out of me is how people panic at this gator because it's moving so slowly through the water when pursuing them. When out of the water and lumbering around it is more agile and quick. And to conclude just how tasteless and dull this movie is I reflect upon its ending which is just another ripoff of the hairraising climax of Jaws and just proves just how great that Steven Spielberg picture was.I thought the first Alligator was a very bad movie but it does outshine its sequel.".

As soon as the movie begins you are hit by jawdropping cinematography that definitely takes you in this very different place and time. Silences and sounds are used to good effect and the minimalist score is wonderful yet bleak. The movie does not rely on much dialogue and at times suffers a little from thisThe characters are very lifelike even if they aren't sketched very clearly to start. You learn who these men are and what each is capable of over the course of the movie which becomes increasingly bleak and permeated with a strange sense of evil. Not a cartoonish Hollywoodlike evil but rather the terrible things men can do and the group dynamics displayed when acts of cruelty are done. The narration by the character Pearce did not work all that well for me and the movie felt a tad long to me due to its slow pace but this was an uneasy viewing. The genre listed on IMDb is thriller but this felt much more like a very very gruesome drama. This is a film bordering on horror themes. Do not expect flashy scenes of action and clear cut good guys against bad guys.Worthwhile even if somewhat depressing".

A dreaded penal colony with a fearsome reputation Van Diemen's Land saw more than its share of horror and barbarism meted out to the convicts unlucky enough to end up there.This film set in 1882 tells the 'true' story of eight convicts who escape from a working party and head out across the Tasmanian wilderness in search of Macquarie Harbour the Hell's Gates in the title of the original short where they believe a ship will be waiting to carry them away from the island.One of the escapees is Alexander Pearce a Gaelic speaking Irishman. Pearce was in fact the only convict to survive the harrowing trek across Tasmania's wild mountainous peaks and valleys and following his recapture told a horrifying tale of murder and cannibalism that still echoes and shocks more than a hundred years after the original events took place.Filmed entirely on location in Tasmania and Victoria's Otway Ranges the film has a dark foreboding quality about it that doesn't let up across its entire 100 minute length. Almost all of the colour has been leached out of the film leaving almost nothing else but drab olive greens and grays. We never get a glimpse of clear blue open sky. The air is constantly heavy with rain and damp and one can only imagine what these convicts from England Scotland and Ireland must have thought as they set out on foot to cross one of the harshest and most forbidding environments on earth.The film is hauntingly narrated by Pearce who peppers his comments with poetical insights into the human psyche that are often as shocking as they are profound.I've looked up at God looking down intones Pearce in his native Gaelic He dances with an axe in his hand. Or this Let God have his Heaven. I am blood. Van Diemen's Land is a stunning debut feature from one of Australia's newest and youngest directors. If this film is any indication of the quality of writing and directing coming out of our film schools today it augers very well for the future of the Australian film industry as a whole.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although it felt like a rewarding experience Van Diemen's Land is not what you would call an easy watch. The viewer is transported back a couple of centuries and plunged into the harsh and untamed Tasmanian landscape for a fairly straightforward tale of man v man v the environment.Despite its' simplicity it's an affecting tale helped by the sparse evocative and apologetic I'm a quiet man voiceover that threads its way through the narrative holding together the otherwise unholdable. It's very much 'inyourface' as there's little historical explanation and only the vaguest sense of any future ahead which compels you to focus on the hereandnow. The score is haunting and the film is beautifully shot with bleachedout greens emphasizing the unforgiving nature of their surroundings and predicament.The trailer gives a good indication of what to expect including two of the more iconic sequences that stayed with me long afterwards  one scene where the group are running timelapsed and ghostlike through the forest trying to escape their pursuers the other the shockingly swift brutality with which the second inmate on the menu meets his maker. Elsewhere we experience the messy and protracted depiction of how hard it is to kill a man and as the numbers dwindle whilst the tension and paranoia mounts individual camp fires become the order of the night as the lengths men would go to survive become increasingly desperate.On the downside I struggled to hear some of the heavilyaccented dialogue especially when the speaker was off screen and it was hard to believe that there were no other nutritious animals in a rainforest bar a solitary snake. Given their limited resources quite how they would have caught them is another matter but they'd have sure as hell tried to save from eating each other.I came out feeling like I'd been badly mauled after 12 rounds in a ring with an enormous and unbeatable foe. It's a real powerhouse of a film that I would most certainly recommend even though one viewing is quite sufficient for me in this lifetime. 710.".

Elsewhere we experience the messy and protracted depiction of how hard it is to kill a man and as the numbers dwindle whilst the tension and paranoia mounts individual camp fires become the order of the night as the lengths men would go to survive become increasingly desperate.On the downside I struggled to hear some of the heavilyaccented dialogue especially when the speaker was off screen and it was hard to believe that there were no other nutritious animals in a rainforest bar a solitary snake. Given their limited resources quite how they would have caught them is another matter but they'd have sure as hell tried to save from eating each other.I came out feeling like I'd been badly mauled after 12 rounds in a ring with an enormous and unbeatable foe. It's a real powerhouse of a film that I would most certainly recommend even though one viewing is quite sufficient for me in this lifetime. 710.";

	schema:headline " Van Diemen's Land is a beautiful film to behold but a lot more work was needed on the screenplay.";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1882 several convicts escaped custody to brave the harsh conditions of Van Diemen's Land in Tasmania. One of the escapees throughout the film is based on the real life convict Alexander Pearce Oscar Redding. Journeying into the wilderness Pearce and seven others were faced with the sheer ruggedness of the landscape and limited resources. As some of the men succumbed to injury the others had no choice but to slaughter their fellow man and then devour them so they would be able to continue on and not starve to death. Much of the tension throughout the film is derived from each man knowing that he is at risk of being the next person to be killed.The first feature film from director Jonathan Auf Der Heide is a great technical achievement. The cinematography throughout Van Diemen's Land contains some of the most beautiful shots you are likely to see this year. Many of the films images have a painterlylike quality to them and the use of the saturated colour scheme ensures a highly unique and textured depiction of the outback. One of the most haunting images is also its ugliest though as a closeup shot captures a British guard munching down on something. It is as though this is foreshadowing the evil we are bound to see throughout the film.Although one can admire the quality of these aesthetics the films decision to be as objective as possible works to its detriment. Heide previously made the short film Hell's Gate which shared the same story about Pearce and his escape and also starred Oscar Redding. It would seem that Heide has not expanded the story from this short film. This is not a full length biopic about Alexander Pearce nor is there any intention to detail the lives of the other convicts either. Their psychological wellbeing is rarely explored with any personal insights. It is disappointing that despite the verisimilitude and authenticity towards the look of the film the characterisation and narrative remain utterly minimal. There is no time dedicated towards any of the characters leaving the film as a passive experience rather than an emotional one. The performances throughout the film are solid with sporadic dialogue but we needed to get to know these characters well so that we could care about their struggle more.Perhaps one of the most fascinating elements that can be taken indirectly from the cannibalism is the subversion of the Australian archetype of mateship. The mythology of the Aussie battler looking after his mates evaporates rapidly as men are slaughtered like cattle in their sleep to ensure the survival of others. The murder scenes are intensely staged throughout the film and feel fitting with the films grittiness. Much of the violence is shown offscreen but the audible screams and slaps of the axe ensure that these moments are gruesomely rather than emotionally affecting. The film's most damning death occurs before a blow is landed as a convict is bitten by a snake inevitably suggesting that he will not be able to continue and will have to be slaughtered.Van Diemen's Land is a beautiful film to behold but a lot more work was needed on the screenplay. The lack of depth development and characterisation certainly diminishes much of the films power and its emotion while the lack of narrative drive will have many questioning the actual point of the film. Despite this the intense moments of violence and the lack of morality may still provoke some to question what they would have done under the same strenuous conditions and circumstances.".

When I heard a film was in production I was interested to see how it would be translated into a motion picture. This should by no means considered a film that delivers on the potential of this story. I suspect budgetary restraints ruled out the possibility of opening scenes such as the prisoner's arrival at Hell's Gates as the prisoners rowed for their lives through the stormy sea. Scenes in the courtroom where Pearce is confronted with the horror of his deeds were similarly ruled out. I also believe budgetary restraints were at the root of so much of the landscape views of Tasmania we were 'treated' to a previous comment said the film works as an ad for the area I didn't rent the film to see an ad for the landscape of Tasmania! In one scene the director focuses on a mountain top for longer than five seconds It was long enough for the thought to enter my mind did he hike up here with a camera and say well I made it up here so this shot is taking up at least six seconds of this movie!Budgetary constraints doesn't mean the film couldn't have been successful engrossing and in some ways this gave it an advantage over any bigbudget films that may succeed it. Whereas they would spend time on backstory by cutting straight to the shock value of the cannibalistic 'middle part of a possible trilogy' as suggested by an earlier comment Auf Der Heide could have given a definitive interpretation of it. Time saved on earlier scenes could have been used to give more depth to the intergroup dynamics leaving the viewer wondering 'who would be voted off next' in a Survivorlike scenario. If you're making a film like this with a low budget the focus has to be more on the human aspects of the group. For this to work a strong narrative voice explaining the group dynamics was needed. Pearce would have been ideal for this but instead we were presented with 'the quiet man' which proved disastrous. Where could the film have succeeded in the context of it having a relatively low budget? How could it have better elicited tension and emotions?

	schema:headline " A Welcome Attempt But Lacking In Depth";
	schema:reviewBody "Wasn't the devil in you when you brought me here?'Van Diemen's Land' opens up a window into the darker chapters of Australia's convict settlement past when the British penal colony was a harsh unforgiving wilderness populated by struggling pioneers and convicts sent to the other side of the earth for stealing so much as a loaf of bread. Once there repeat offenders might be confined to Sarah Island a hellish prison camp in Macquarie Harbour in western Van Diemen's Land now Tasmania. Conditions there were so extreme that in 1822 Irishborn malcontent Alexander Pearce and seven others tasked with felling the surrounding forests to provide shipbuilders with highquality wood attempted to escape their exile. When plans to steal a moored whaling vessel fell through the escapees without much aforethought plunged into the harsh Tasmanian wilderness intending to travel east to Hobart some 225km away. Although Robert Greenhill one of the convicts could draw upon his many years as a sailor to provide navigational expertise none present knew how to survive in bushland so inhospitable even the indigenous Australians largely avoided it and when food supplies ran out they turned to cannibalism. Few of the illfated expedition would survive to tell the tale. In 'Van Diemen's Land' we join the convicts on the day of their escape attempt and follow the grizzly events that ensue.The story of Alexander Pearce is perhaps not unsurprisingly missing from the school curriculum in Australia and it was only through this film that I myself became familiar with this dark chapter of White Australia. 'Van Diemen's Land' inspired me to fire up my browser and learn more with the realisation that in movie terms I was watching the middle part of a trilogy. Part 1 would have dealt with Pearce's repeated offences condemning him to slave labour on Sarah Island. There he would continue to prove unruly for the authorities practicing his talent for theft and disruption ultimately finding himself on work detail felling trees in Macquarie Harbour and seeing an opportunity for escape. Part 3 would have dealt with the consequences of his actions including one final adventure which the last sequence of 'Van Diemen's Land' briefly covers. Director and cowriter Jonathan auf der Heide however appears to be fixated upon the middle part of the story and while the moment when Pearce acquired a taste for human flesh strikes an undeniable discord with all but perhaps the Korowai tribe of Papua New Guinea I can't help feeling that it's a little like telling the tale of Ned Kelly focusing only on the killings at Stringybark Creek. Only a few captions either side of the film quickly fill in the blanks hinting that there is more to the story. Nonetheless 'Part 2' is wellcrafted for what it is and sheds a memorable yet gloomy light on this hitherto forgotten saga.auf der Heide wisely chooses a cast of unknowns to inhabit the fateful eight which ensures the audience will accept their alter egos at face value. Oscar Redding perhaps the bestknown creates an Alexander Pearce just possibly capable of redemption up until the moment he agrees to sacrifice a member of the party for food while Arthur Angel portrays a Robert Greenhill you wouldn't want to be within twenty miles of when it came time to sleep. The rest of the cast fill out the remainder of the illfated group with similarly creditable performances with the Scottish characters delivering their lines in Gallic alongside the 18th Century English dialect to underscore Australia's role as a dumping ground for convicts all across the British Isles. The stringpowered score often more sound than symphony meshes well with the bleak washedout picture to strongly evoke the dark mood of the piece. There are no archetypal heroes only desperate human animals hastening the decay of civilisation's thin veneer. Filmed on location in southcentral Tasmania the authentic natural backdrop does much on its own to sell the concept that the escapees are not only at the end of the earth as they themselves suggest but that the land is cold and unforgiving  just as much today as it was in 1822. If I have issues with the film therefore it's the storyline.By focusing purely upon the escape attempt and the descent into cannibalism the tale feels reduced somewhat into a Bgrade exploitation horror. It doesn't provide suitable buildup to properly explore the choices certain characters make throughout though the documentation for this does exist. In consequence I felt the leap to 'the other meat' was a little rushed reminding me of an early South Park episode where cannibalism is the first rather than last resort. In addition the full story would be more satisfying than some of the edited highlights 'cannibalised' for the purposes of a thriller. There is far more to the Alexander Drake story than we are witness to in 'Van Diemen's Land'. Undeniably the issue of runtime comes into play here however as I suggested earlier there is enough scope for more than one feature. However auf der Heide is the first to explore it cinematically and perhaps this will spark interest in genuine Australian Gothic from here on.

	onyx:emotionText "Wasn't the devil in you when you brought me here?'Van Diemen's Land' opens up a window into the darker chapters of Australia's convict settlement past when the British penal colony was a harsh unforgiving wilderness populated by struggling pioneers and convicts sent to the other side of the earth for stealing so much as a loaf of bread. Once there repeat offenders might be confined to Sarah Island a hellish prison camp in Macquarie Harbour in western Van Diemen's Land now Tasmania. Conditions there were so extreme that in 1822 Irishborn malcontent Alexander Pearce and seven others tasked with felling the surrounding forests to provide shipbuilders with highquality wood attempted to escape their exile. When plans to steal a moored whaling vessel fell through the escapees without much aforethought plunged into the harsh Tasmanian wilderness intending to travel east to Hobart some 225km away. Although Robert Greenhill one of the convicts could draw upon his many years as a sailor to provide navigational expertise none present knew how to survive in bushland so inhospitable even the indigenous Australians largely avoided it and when food supplies ran out they turned to cannibalism. Few of the illfated expedition would survive to tell the tale. In 'Van Diemen's Land' we join the convicts on the day of their escape attempt and follow the grizzly events that ensue.The story of Alexander Pearce is perhaps not unsurprisingly missing from the school curriculum in Australia and it was only through this film that I myself became familiar with this dark chapter of White Australia. 'Van Diemen's Land' inspired me to fire up my browser and learn more with the realisation that in movie terms I was watching the middle part of a trilogy. Part 1 would have dealt with Pearce's repeated offences condemning him to slave labour on Sarah Island. There he would continue to prove unruly for the authorities practicing his talent for theft and disruption ultimately finding himself on work detail felling trees in Macquarie Harbour and seeing an opportunity for escape. Part 3 would have dealt with the consequences of his actions including one final adventure which the last sequence of 'Van Diemen's Land' briefly covers. Director and cowriter Jonathan auf der Heide however appears to be fixated upon the middle part of the story and while the moment when Pearce acquired a taste for human flesh strikes an undeniable discord with all but perhaps the Korowai tribe of Papua New Guinea I can't help feeling that it's a little like telling the tale of Ned Kelly focusing only on the killings at Stringybark Creek. Only a few captions either side of the film quickly fill in the blanks hinting that there is more to the story. Nonetheless 'Part 2' is wellcrafted for what it is and sheds a memorable yet gloomy light on this hitherto forgotten saga.auf der Heide wisely chooses a cast of unknowns to inhabit the fateful eight which ensures the audience will accept their alter egos at face value. Oscar Redding perhaps the bestknown creates an Alexander Pearce just possibly capable of redemption up until the moment he agrees to sacrifice a member of the party for food while Arthur Angel portrays a Robert Greenhill you wouldn't want to be within twenty miles of when it came time to sleep. The rest of the cast fill out the remainder of the illfated group with similarly creditable performances with the Scottish characters delivering their lines in Gallic alongside the 18th Century English dialect to underscore Australia's role as a dumping ground for convicts all across the British Isles. The stringpowered score often more sound than symphony meshes well with the bleak washedout picture to strongly evoke the dark mood of the piece. There are no archetypal heroes only desperate human animals hastening the decay of civilisation's thin veneer. Filmed on location in southcentral Tasmania the authentic natural backdrop does much on its own to sell the concept that the escapees are not only at the end of the earth as they themselves suggest but that the land is cold and unforgiving  just as much today as it was in 1822. If I have issues with the film therefore it's the storyline.By focusing purely upon the escape attempt and the descent into cannibalism the tale feels reduced somewhat into a Bgrade exploitation horror. It doesn't provide suitable buildup to properly explore the choices certain characters make throughout though the documentation for this does exist. In consequence I felt the leap to 'the other meat' was a little rushed reminding me of an early South Park episode where cannibalism is the first rather than last resort. In addition the full story would be more satisfying than some of the edited highlights 'cannibalised' for the purposes of a thriller. There is far more to the Alexander Drake story than we are witness to in 'Van Diemen's Land'. Undeniably the issue of runtime comes into play here however as I suggested earlier there is enough scope for more than one feature. However auf der Heide is the first to explore it cinematically and perhaps this will spark interest in genuine Australian Gothic from here on. It certainly captures the tone and feel of that bleak world taking strides towards tapping into a rarely explored period of Australian history that perhaps may now be brought to light free of the nationalist veil. Certainly any proud Australian and film fan should see 'Van Diemen's Land' for this purpose and genre fans everywhere will appreciate what it does achieve. Let's hope it's a taster of things to come.";

There is not one single female in this movie as it's about a place where none were. Almost like a dream of life lost for the souls there the feminine warmth is a lost memory and song. Seen perhaps a cautionary tale of a hard and man made time it depicts shows how this may have transpired how it may have come to pass with a stand out line for me being six pairs of shoes. This is no movie for the faint hearted and the acting is absolutely top notch. Be warned however this is not a study of human spirit over coming anything but rather about the dark slide into the worst aspects of a hopeless humanity.

That this film succeeds to the degree it does is a testament to the people behind it.There must have been a lot of time spent by the writers and director trying to work out the right approach for Alexander Pearce. Depicting him as a psychopathic cannibal from the outset as per 'For the Term of His Natural Life' would have been wrong he was surely more nuanced than that. This was a man transported to the colonies for the theft of six pairs of shoes not any type of violent act.The need to eat your fellow escapees would have been a slow dawn of horror and that is captured quite nicely here as these uneducated men stumble off into a world they knew nothing about. It's instructive to remember that most of us would be scared if dropped into this remote wilderness to find our own way out even if equipped with provisions warm clothing and a working knowledge of the geography and local florafauna. To imagine traversing what was completely unknown to any of them and literally a world away from their birthplaces dressed only in old prison rags and with food limited to some flour is very frightening indeed.The cinematography is great with the washedout colours emphasising the alien nature of this wilderness. The acting is good as well and the use of Gaelic for the occasional introspection of Pearce helps to prompt the viewer to think of just how someone can end up so far from home and in such a horrific situation.Unfortunately there are a few stumbles as well forgivable as this is the director's first feature. Some of the imagery is overdone  I'm thinking of the guard chewing at the beginning yes we know what's coming ...  and the characters could probably be better distinguished through a little more talking than they actually do. As there is no back story or wider explanation of their predicament the film does feel slightly repetitious in the middle section. There was also no attempt to show the men hunting for food even though there would have been native wildlife all around them. To be fair though the depiction of cannibalism as the inevitable outcome of tackling this terrain with limited supplies is the main story and given the limited budget of the film they were probably wise to focus on that aspect exclusively.All up congratulations to the filmmakers for tackling such a tough subject and making it watchable. This is a very grim part of our history but it needs to be known and discussed more than it is. The film is not easy to stomach pun intended! but you cannot watch it and not be affected and is that not the aim of any movie? Pearce was not a wronged hero he was a person who twice turned to cannibalism. But this film makes you think about your own response to landing in such an awful situation as these men. If the difference between civilisation and barbarism is three square meals then these escaped convicts were in a place none of us would want to go.".

	schema:headline " Fascinating insight into desperation";
	schema:reviewBody "I've been wanting to watch this for a few years and finally got around to it last night on Stan. I didn't know much about the story apart from the setting and that there was some cannibalism involved.Contrary to what IMDb says about Australia's most notorious convict I have lived in Australia for 20 years and had never heard of the main protagonist. That was just as well since I didn't know how the story was going unfold. That I had never seen any of the actors before also contributed to the realism.While there are plenty of films about the dark ages of Europe and the pioneering days of North America there are not enough films about the Australia's murky past. It's generally wellknown that Irish lads might be sent here for petty crimes but it's not well understood nowadays  when Australia is one of the most desirable places to live in the world  how inhospitable it was when white men first arrived. That the film depicts this was in itself sufficient reason for me to watch it in its entirety. There are plenty more thoughtful stories that could be told about this era.I enjoyed the slow burning pace of the plot and the fact that it was based on a real story but what impressed me the most was the cinematography. Scene after scene is beautifully framed and coloured and often depicts the insignificance of man in the vast wilderness. I'd watch it again just for the scenery.The acting and story itself were enthralling. I don't envy the cast for filming in such conditions! I only wish that I had had the opportunity to display subtitles for the English as well as the Gaelic as some of the phraseology and accents were hard to catch.There was a scene in the second half where the picture quality deteriorated for a minute or two but that may have been down to a bottleneck in the bandwidth.I was in two minds as the credits rolled about the beginning and end of the film. It would have been more Hollywood to set up the characters a bit early on so that we could understand their motivations.

	onyx:emotionText "I've been wanting to watch this for a few years and finally got around to it last night on Stan. I didn't know much about the story apart from the setting and that there was some cannibalism involved.Contrary to what IMDb says about Australia's most notorious convict I have lived in Australia for 20 years and had never heard of the main protagonist. That was just as well since I didn't know how the story was going unfold. That I had never seen any of the actors before also contributed to the realism.While there are plenty of films about the dark ages of Europe and the pioneering days of North America there are not enough films about the Australia's murky past. It's generally wellknown that Irish lads might be sent here for petty crimes but it's not well understood nowadays  when Australia is one of the most desirable places to live in the world  how inhospitable it was when white men first arrived. That the film depicts this was in itself sufficient reason for me to watch it in its entirety. There are plenty more thoughtful stories that could be told about this era.I enjoyed the slow burning pace of the plot and the fact that it was based on a real story but what impressed me the most was the cinematography. Scene after scene is beautifully framed and coloured and often depicts the insignificance of man in the vast wilderness. I'd watch it again just for the scenery.The acting and story itself were enthralling. I don't envy the cast for filming in such conditions! I only wish that I had had the opportunity to display subtitles for the English as well as the Gaelic as some of the phraseology and accents were hard to catch.There was a scene in the second half where the picture quality deteriorated for a minute or two but that may have been down to a bottleneck in the bandwidth.I was in two minds as the credits rolled about the beginning and end of the film. It would have been more Hollywood to set up the characters a bit early on so that we could understand their motivations. Similarly it would have been very Hollywood to show how the main protagonist ultimately came out of the wilderness and made his tale public. Having slept on it  short of creating a film twice as long  I'm glad at the choices made by the director. The focus is purely on the survival story.

The usual criticism was voiced with Martin being 15 years older than Leigh but in this case it works because part of the plot is fresh faced Ms. Leigh avoiding being taken in by older Broadway sharpies.No memorable songs were written by composers Jule Styne and Leo Robin for this film and that's a pity because if a hit had come out of it the film would be better remembered. Martin I'm sure realized no hits were coming out of this and he probably had two of his own songs put in there. He had hit records around this time of the Prologue from Pagliacci and There's No Tomorrow O Sole Mio. He performs them well. I would love to know if Janet Leigh was dubbed and by who. I don't believe she ever sang in any other film. For that reason I suspect a dubbing if for no other reason that she wouldn't want to be going up against a singer with as powerful a voice as Tony Martin.Ironic that two of the players in this Ann Miller and Janet Leigh died this year. Nobody had to worry about dubbing Ann Miller in any department. She performs her big number Let the Worry Bird Worry for You in classic style.Bob Crosby who by that time was known as the afternoon Crosby because his radio and later TV show came on in the afternoon unlike his legendary brother. Being the Bing Crosby fan that I am I have a soft spot in my heart for his Let's Make Comparison where he's comparing himself to brother Bing. Bob led a pretty good jazz band at that time and had a modest career in B films.Eddie Bracken who was so good in his Paramount films was cloying and annoying in this one. His machinations trying to get his clients on the Bob Crosby show were downright stupid here and not terribly funny.The ending though was an unintentional hoot. Janet Leigh comes from Pelican Falls Vermont and early in the film she's given a send off by the high school band performing their alma mater song. I thought the ending with the high school band interrupting Bob Crosby's broadcast to reprise their high school song was ridiculous. Was that Howard Hughes's idea? Well he didn't do as much damage here as he did on The Outlaw.The film had a lot of potential and it could have been done better even at RKO but I suspect Howard Hughes meddled a bit too much here.".

	schema:reviewBody "Designed partially as a showcase for RKO owner Howard Hughes girlfriend Janet Leigh. Hughes could afford to import quite a lot of first rate talent in the effort mostly from best in the musical business MGM. Current or former MGM talent included Leigh Ann Miller Gloria DeHaven and Tony Martin along with musical number director Busby Berkeley. Leigh proved herself competent as a singer and dancer and is certainly pleasant in personality and a pleasure to look at.In the musical numbers featuring the four girls Gloria DeHaven is the standout sorry Ann Miller fans. DeHaven sings superbly handles the dancing with aplomb has just the right mix of charisma humor sincerity and takes a back seat to no one in the beauty department.I thought the musical numbers well staged and mostly very pleasant exception the very banal Pellican Falls school song. The comedy of Smith and Dale I could live without if you'll excuse the expression. And Eddie Bracken is too frenetic and broad in his comedy for my taste.Though none of the songs became a standard a couple are excellent I especially enjoyed The Worry Bird and The Closer You Are has a gorgeous melody.All in all the film is the equal of many of the lower budget MGM musicals and that ain't bad at all.".

	onyx:emotionText "Designed partially as a showcase for RKO owner Howard Hughes girlfriend Janet Leigh. Hughes could afford to import quite a lot of first rate talent in the effort mostly from best in the musical business MGM. Current or former MGM talent included Leigh Ann Miller Gloria DeHaven and Tony Martin along with musical number director Busby Berkeley. Leigh proved herself competent as a singer and dancer and is certainly pleasant in personality and a pleasure to look at.In the musical numbers featuring the four girls Gloria DeHaven is the standout sorry Ann Miller fans. DeHaven sings superbly handles the dancing with aplomb has just the right mix of charisma humor sincerity and takes a back seat to no one in the beauty department.I thought the musical numbers well staged and mostly very pleasant exception the very banal Pellican Falls school song. The comedy of Smith and Dale I could live without if you'll excuse the expression. And Eddie Bracken is too frenetic and broad in his comedy for my taste.Though none of the songs became a standard a couple are excellent I especially enjoyed The Worry Bird and The Closer You Are has a gorgeous melody.All in all the film is the equal of many of the lower budget MGM musicals and that ain't bad at all.";

As to the film he did not look as good as I remember in publicity pictures there was not the extent of distribution back then so I do not remember ever seeing him in film. I agree that his acting was not superb but not much worse than Gene Kelly tho' the dancing could be better. In those days the studios tried to make their people as versatile as possible. I think I'll save this one on DVD just for old times sake of my old crush because with that Big Chief Hole in the Ground musical number it will probably not get much exposure in the future. It is not at all PC it's almost offensive even to me. It is surely offensive to native Americans.".

There are echoes of the GarlandRooney cycle of musicals from MGM with a spice of Fox glitz and the good ol' feelin' of wellbeing from Warners' Doris Day vehicles of a similar period.The only snag is that Hughes did really have any big stars on his payroll. What TWO TICKETS TO Broadway presents is a panoply of wouldbe leading lights youngsters on their way to stardom and imitations of more famous originals such as Bob Crosby who does a specialty number with a cardboard cutout of his more illustrious sibling Bing.Having said that some of the cast give winning turns. The triumvirate of Janet Leigh Ann Miller and Gloria DeHaven adumbrate a similar conception in Fox's GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES 1953 and they acquit themselves thoroughly well in the song and dance sequences with Miller getting the chance to show off her famed legs. Tony Martin croons his way through one or two numbers to the delights of hordes of adoring bobbysoxers. Eddie Bracken camps it up in a largely extraneous comedy role.Yet perhaps the most interesting aspect of James V. Kern's allstar lineup is its inherent structural contradiction that tells us a lot about the contradictions of movie capitalism at the time. The film begins in Garland Rooney fashion by suggesting that given time and talent anyone can make it big so long as they have the drive and energy to do so even if they originate from smalltown and America and have to travel to New York by Greyhound bus. This is precisely what Leigh DeHaven and Miller try to do.Yet once they get there they find that they are very much at the agents' and radio programmakers' mercy. They have to alter their work to suit specific formats and compromise at every opportunity in line with their employers' requirements. We wonder at this point whether Broadway  like Hollywood  actually values originality or whether or not both institutions would be much happier with carbon copies of tried and tested formulas.The film does not attempt to answer the question of course why should it when it was planned as a joyful musical but it reveals an undercurrent of cynicism about the potentially adverse effects of moneymaking and success.".

In summary it was quite enjoyable on its own merits though it seemed a bit long during the last 30 minutes when a bit too many numbers were being performed. Still I liked Tony Martin's singing at least when he went for more pop tunes though I was amused when he performed There's No Tomorrow which would later become Elvis Presley's It's Now or Never! Also pretty entertained by Janet Leigh's singing and dancing. Interesting fact One of Ms. Leigh's early films was a straight part in Words and Music which was supposed to be a bio of Rodgers  Hart where Mickey Rooney performed Manhatten. Here it's performed by her and Martin with some added lyrics mentioning South Pacific which was a current musical by Rodgers  HAMMERSTEIN! She's not bad doing either singing or dancing which was choreographed by the legendary Busby Berkeley. The best dancing is by Ann Miller of course every time she spins and taps up a storm! Eddie Bracken and Gloria DeHaven are the comic couple and they're quite funny throughout. I also liked a funny number concerning Bob Crosby and his famous brother who appears as a mannequin but then comes to life at the end though we don't see if that actually was Bing by that point though it certainly looked like him from behind! As for Smith  Dale well I thought they were funny enough though part of me can understand why they didn't make too many movies during their lifetime. In summary I mostly enjoyed Two Tickets to Broadway. P.S. That Indian number at the end is definitely not politically correct today!".

Leigh was the freshfaced pretty vivacious discovery of Norma Shearer. She was a natural.The film also features Eddie Bracken Bob Crosby plus Charles Dale and Joe Smith in roles intended for Laurel and Hardy.Despite this cast and some humorous and romantic moments this isn't a great musical. The songs are very uninspired. Tony Martin is described in this film as a baritone. You classify singers by sound and not range and he sounds for all the world like a tenor to me. In fact the Prologue from Pagliacci sung by Tonio a baritone was low for him and demonstrates that the beauty of his voice was in the upper range. Compare his voice to Nelson Eddy's a true baritone.Leigh plays Nancy Peterson the star of her home town who leaves to become a Broadway star. She meets three hungry out of work showgirls Hannah Foxy and Joyce DeHaven Lawrence and Miller whose show just closed and whose agent did not send them money to return to New York.The agent is Lew Bracken who is as low level in the agency world as you can get. He lies like a rug and has been promising his great talent Dan Carter Martin a big job. His last lie gets him into big trouble. He has a supposed rep from Crosby tell Dan that he needs to put together an act and then Crosby will feature him on his television show.Lew convinces the deli owners Dale and Smith to finance this big act. Of course rehearsals are interminable Lew has no place to put it.Everyone is good. Barbara Lawrence was a highly touted actress who never achieved stardom she's mentioned throughout the film The Star but no matter what they put her in or how often they mentioned her the public never was attached to her.Miller of course was a tremendous tapper and featured in some great films. She almost seems to be slumming here.DeHaven who used to live where I'm from with her thenhusband car dealer Richard Fincher she married him twice was beautiful and a good performer. She did everything  Broadway theater movies TV hosting game shows. Today she is 90 and one of the last living actresses from the golden age. There must be something in the water here because the city's men attract film stars. Ingrid Bergman lived here also with her husband Dr. Lindstrom.Martin sang beautifully as he always did but I could have used better music.Leigh was very vibrant and if her dancing wasn't perfect she was a delight and sang well. A perfect ingnue.The color in this film is so garish it's not funny. Someone said Howard Hughes knew what he was doing  I frankly don't think he knew much about making movies. He knew a goodlooking woman when he saw one and he had knowledge of airplanes. Irving Thalberg he wasn't.".

But occasionally Ginger drops a pithy one liner or a curse word which seems completely out of place.The supporting cast was filled with stereotypes. The harsh minister and the sage native American hunter were especially flat.Ginger Snaps Back gives you two things. An entertaining werewolf movie.

	schema:reviewBody "This prequel concerns the sisters Ginger and Brigitte making their way through 19th century Canada in what one can assume to be a previous incarnation. Having lost their parents the orphaned girls trek alone through the wilderness during a cold harsh winter. They stumble upon the remains of an Indian village which looks to have been ripped apart by some great beast. One of the few survivors an old wise woman warns them that they must kill the boy or one sister will kill the other. When Brigitte accidentally steps into a bear trap a short time later the two girls are rescued and assisted by a handsome Indian man known only as The Hunter who leads the girls to nearby Bailey Fort...perhaps the very fort around which the future suburban community of Bailey Downs will spring. The fort is in poor shape. The men are suspicious the atmosphere is bleak and the supplies are running low. It seems that the men who were sent for winter provisions several months before never returned...at least not in human form. Indeed several strange and vicious beasts seem to be stalking the woods just beyond the fort...and there may be one within as well!This 3rd installment in the imaginative and intelligent Ginger Snaps series lacks the black humor and witty script of the previous two. The girls are lovely and convincing the setting of a snowbound fort is both creepy and beautiful and the new character of The Hunter is intriguing and nice to look at but this film takes itself far too seriously. I also had a hard time accepting the fact that a young girl in the 19th century would utter a phrase like These people are fcked. Such instances of modern dialogue inserted into a setting of 100 years past is disconcerting at best...but maybe I'm the only one it would bother. The beasts are highly visible in the final scenes of the film and are pretty impressive looking. Other than that the films gets a little weighted down by the gloomy atmosphere with nary a joke to be found. The religious metaphors and Native American mysticism seem to have been pulled right out of The Crucible The Scarlet Letter and Thunderheart and seem to have been used for set dressing rather than as crucial plot devices. Still there's a good amount of blood and gore to please most splatter enthusiasts and an open ending which seems both to resolve the second film and bring us right back around to the first. It's not a terrible movie by any means but since I'd come to expect a certain amount of smart black comedy and found none here it was just a little disappointing. The girls do a great job with their characters as they always do but they had far less to work with this time around. I give this a 6 on a scale of 10 whereas the first two each get a 9.".

	schema:headline " A great movie in its own right";
	schema:reviewBody "Neither sequel has been nearly as good as the original but considering how brilliant Ginger Snaps was no one could reasonably expect that. Actually my main disappointment with both sequels is that I wanted what GS hadhorror humor hipness irony. But anytime there's a sequel that tries to be the original it fails because it tried to emulate the first installment. Both sequels have completely different story lines and character. The only real continuity is in the characterization and the themes. And that's a brilliant decision. I probably liked The Beginning better than Unleashed but I just finished watching the former so I can't be objective. It is in its own right a really terrific film. All of the films have had their fair share of visual panache but this one is so beautiful it reminded me of Sleepy Hollow at times. I almost wish they'd been released under completely different titlesI can't help but compare the sequels to the original and they're not really sequels. They all feature the same two leading actress they're all about werewolves Unleashed even picks up after the first left off. But you could watch Unleashed without having seen Ginger Snaps and still know what's going on and since the third starts close to 200 years before the first you obviously don't have to see the others. They're separate films connected by actresses and themes as I see it. Speaking of the actressesEmily Perkins and Isabelle Katherine are of course beyond reproach. Their direction is wrong they don't fit in to the milieu they're put in but I think that's a director error. Or the director's way of maintaining the integrity of the characters we know from the first two movies. Ginger and Bridget can't exactly be Puritans can they? Next to the dropdead brilliant score Mike Shields composed for the original this soundtrack doesn't stand a chance. But it works very very well with the setting and the action.

	onyx:emotionText "Neither sequel has been nearly as good as the original but considering how brilliant Ginger Snaps was no one could reasonably expect that. Actually my main disappointment with both sequels is that I wanted what GS hadhorror humor hipness irony. But anytime there's a sequel that tries to be the original it fails because it tried to emulate the first installment. Both sequels have completely different story lines and character. The only real continuity is in the characterization and the themes. And that's a brilliant decision. I probably liked The Beginning better than Unleashed but I just finished watching the former so I can't be objective. It is in its own right a really terrific film. All of the films have had their fair share of visual panache but this one is so beautiful it reminded me of Sleepy Hollow at times. I almost wish they'd been released under completely different titlesI can't help but compare the sequels to the original and they're not really sequels. They all feature the same two leading actress they're all about werewolves Unleashed even picks up after the first left off. But you could watch Unleashed without having seen Ginger Snaps and still know what's going on and since the third starts close to 200 years before the first you obviously don't have to see the others. They're separate films connected by actresses and themes as I see it. Speaking of the actressesEmily Perkins and Isabelle Katherine are of course beyond reproach. Their direction is wrong they don't fit in to the milieu they're put in but I think that's a director error. Or the director's way of maintaining the integrity of the characters we know from the first two movies. Ginger and Bridget can't exactly be Puritans can they? Next to the dropdead brilliant score Mike Shields composed for the original this soundtrack doesn't stand a chance. But it works very very well with the setting and the action. I had to watch one scene towards the end the fire twice only because of the music.

It uses only the characters of Ginger and Brigitte and werewolves of course taking place in different time and situations. The costumes of the sisters specially the dark Little Red Riding Hood clothes of Ginger are scary and complete the atmosphere imposing a sort of fear. The makeup of the werewolves is excellent.

I first saw the original Ginger Snaps back about 5 years ago on HBO. and the thing that got me to look away from my computer and watch the movie that was playing on the TV was the Slide Show in the beginning. The music by Michael Sheilds got me to look over and the slide show play to my morbid humor. after that it was the awesome script and oddly humorous situations. The Second one in which i finally watched last year  proverbially knocked me off my feet. That movie not only followed the sad tragic truth of the downward spiral of infected Brigette after Ginger Fitzgerald but had twisted that messed with you. I loved the Second one Just as much as the first. The Third is an awesome film  i just recently watched that for the first time about 4 days ago but with both of the Fitz's before the curse.. in the 19th century is out of place and doesn't really tie in with the other two. Now depending on how creative you are you can look at this two different ways. 1 that its just a different way so telling the Ginger Snaps story... or 2  this is how i look at it  Since it is suppose to be the beginning of their curse I feel that this movie is trying to portray the fact that Ginger and Bridgette were actually Cursed in or before the 19th century and then Their Damnation is that they relive life over and over again only to be infected and die once more. This may be because  this is my reasoning from the prequel there was a set destiny for the girls and their pact and love for one another  To be together no matter what  disrupted the flow of destiny that was suppose to set everything right.. and now they are damned.. and they will never change their way .. Their pact is their curse. If the third movie portrayed this .. These movies would be very very deep and imaginative.. and i throughly believe they are leaning toward this Story line... And if thats the case .. their could be a fourth...fifth .. This could be the equal to The Lord of the Rings .. The Dark Tower... In its own respected Field mind you . I'm partial to these movies to start with tho. Watch them all at least once.. you wont be disappointed".

The first is classic wonderful acting very clever story realisticlooking werewolves the humor in it was great and the scenery and style was just terrific. It was also very believable for a horror movie. The viewers especially female could relate to the characters. I felt like you couldn't get any better than the original. Then came along number two and to my surprise I really enjoyed it as well. The continuity and great acting was there. I'm with the smaller group of GS fans who actually liked the ending and thought it was pretty cool. I wasn't expecting that twist  an ending that had great potential for a number three well it would be number four now.Now comes this rather eh different prequel. There are different theories as to why this movie was made. Whatever the real reason there are problems with this film that make it below the others... I felt like I was seeing the first GS all over again just poorly done. Kind of like a bad remake. The writing wasn't very good the humor was missing and it wasn't nearly as suspenseful as the first two. It was pretty boring and predictable to tell you the truth. A big problem to me is the way they spoke in this movie. If they are supposed to be in 1812 then they should be speaking like it and not acting so modern. Ginger acted much like she did in the original very tough and cursing a lot which didn't fit the period it was supposed to take place in...That made it seem silly to me. Also the storyline just wasn't that great. I didn't feel for any of the characters  I didn't connect to them like I did in GS1. The scenery was cool but that's about it. Everything else well it was disappointing. Great to see Katharine and Emily again though. Just wish it were better either made more sense and connected with numbers one and two or stood out alone as a terrific alternate story  to me it sadly did neither.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm saddened. I really wanted to like this movie as I am the biggest fan of the original Ginger Snaps and its leads Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins for their work in the original and Perkins even more so for almost singlehandedly saving Ginger Snaps Unleashed. Alas I am afraid that this series is like the original Highlander There can only be one.You know you're in for a long ride from the very beginning. It breaks a rule of cinema narration that no scriptwriter was dumb enough to break prior a rule so dumb to break nobody thought previously to make it a rule it has two introductions. The first introduction is in screen text about a hunting party never returning in 1816. Stark dark and ominous. Except then they followed it with a narrated introduction by Isabelle. The latter I am afraid is an incoherent trainwreck about the curse of the red and black checkers? having a chance to be stopped . . . blighting the land . . . the white man bringing diseases . . . oaths higher than God or fate . . . or something. Even Ed Wood Jr. would have been embarrassed enough to rewrite it. Unfortunately Isabelle drew the short straw on reading the mess and I felt sorry for her. This hasitbegunyet effect starts the movie out at a leaden pace from which it never recovers and creates a halfassed horrormyth for the story to depend which insults the audience not to mention perhaps Native Americans.The story starts in 1816 as two orphaned teenage girls Ginger Katharine Isabelle and Brigitte Emily Perkins come to a fort in the wilderness that has been under siege for months by some kind of diabolical creatures I think they might be werewolves. The remaining men in the fort are just a little suspicious since the sisters were able to reach it untouched when nobody else could reach it or set foot outside it without getting ripped to shreds. Except an Indian called Hunter.It is apparent that the entire production was in over its head at attempting a period piece like this from the producer the scriptwriter to the director and crew to the actors. The dialog sounds anachronistic and isn't very good anyway. The characters do not act 21st century but neither do they act in a way that's believably 19th century. Isabelle and Perkins and the other actors are given no historical point of reference and no dialog coaching to be able to pull this off. I could forgive the dialects being inconsistent if anything I think dialects were far more diverse in that area then but they sounded too commonplace. At this budget they could have aimed for a squalid scaled down timeless feeling but they did not. I could not believe that Isabelle and Perkins' characters fit into the early 19th century at all. The movie tries to joke about this. Ginger Isabelle occasionally pipes in with modern swear words that so lilted her dialog in GS1 but given that this movie never sounded 19th century anyway the comical contrast never works. Music was a plus in both the original and Unleashed. In this movie it is just awful. It sounds like they hired a single cellist to play four notes and then looped them repeatedly. Then there was Ginger's transformation at least they should have made it somewhat consistent with what occurred in GS1 instead of making her feverish and dizzy. Please. To see a young woman in that time period misbehaving Ginger did. THAT would have been exciting. What we got was boring. The rest of the cast tries with varying degrees of success. J. R. Bourne does well as the secondincommand but his character is just twodimensional the ahole dimension and the dchebag dimension. Hugh Dillon as the Reverend also a villain is allowed to overplay his part and his accent sounds jarringly anachronistic. In writing his role however it's apparent that the screenwriter took care to consult neither the Bible nor sermons written at the time. The Reverend's preaching sounds almost as nonsensical as the werewolf myth given at the beginning and I don't think it was deliberate. Matthew Walker as the doctor and Brendan Fletcher as Finn give very good performances and Fletcher's was so good I was surprised and saddened he did not have a larger part. Tom McCamus does a fair job as the fort commander or would have done one had the makeup department not given him such a silly wig. He almost makes it look dignified but his gravitas was one false move away from sidesplitting comedy. I think I'm the wrong gender and sexual orientation to judge Nathanial Arcand playing hunter. Moreover he reminded me too much of David Carradine in Kung Fu and that probably means I'm the wrong generation too. It makes me want to recuse myself from reviewing him. The movie never rises above its leaden pace and never becomes actually scary. Then there are the little things like the aforementioned music or that a werewolf makeup was an immobile mask that was a throwback to the 60s. The werewolves looked like neither wolves nor men nor anything like the werewolf in GS1.The only good thing the ending. No I'm not being the droll critic talking about what a relief it was that the movie was over. It did have a good ending. You should decide fifteen minutes in if you think it's worth waiting for. Unfortunately I think this was a desperate endeavor to try to cash in on a great movie's name while putting forward as little money and effort in as possible.Upgraded one star from my original review. It is very good to see Perkins and Isabelle work together and sisters' bond was still evocative and interesting.".

	onyx:emotionText "I'm saddened. I really wanted to like this movie as I am the biggest fan of the original Ginger Snaps and its leads Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins for their work in the original and Perkins even more so for almost singlehandedly saving Ginger Snaps Unleashed. Alas I am afraid that this series is like the original Highlander There can only be one.You know you're in for a long ride from the very beginning. It breaks a rule of cinema narration that no scriptwriter was dumb enough to break prior a rule so dumb to break nobody thought previously to make it a rule it has two introductions. The first introduction is in screen text about a hunting party never returning in 1816. Stark dark and ominous. Except then they followed it with a narrated introduction by Isabelle. The latter I am afraid is an incoherent trainwreck about the curse of the red and black checkers? having a chance to be stopped . . . blighting the land . . . the white man bringing diseases . . . oaths higher than God or fate . . . or something. Even Ed Wood Jr. would have been embarrassed enough to rewrite it. Unfortunately Isabelle drew the short straw on reading the mess and I felt sorry for her. This hasitbegunyet effect starts the movie out at a leaden pace from which it never recovers and creates a halfassed horrormyth for the story to depend which insults the audience not to mention perhaps Native Americans.The story starts in 1816 as two orphaned teenage girls Ginger Katharine Isabelle and Brigitte Emily Perkins come to a fort in the wilderness that has been under siege for months by some kind of diabolical creatures I think they might be werewolves. The remaining men in the fort are just a little suspicious since the sisters were able to reach it untouched when nobody else could reach it or set foot outside it without getting ripped to shreds. Except an Indian called Hunter.It is apparent that the entire production was in over its head at attempting a period piece like this from the producer the scriptwriter to the director and crew to the actors. The dialog sounds anachronistic and isn't very good anyway. The characters do not act 21st century but neither do they act in a way that's believably 19th century. Isabelle and Perkins and the other actors are given no historical point of reference and no dialog coaching to be able to pull this off. I could forgive the dialects being inconsistent if anything I think dialects were far more diverse in that area then but they sounded too commonplace. At this budget they could have aimed for a squalid scaled down timeless feeling but they did not. I could not believe that Isabelle and Perkins' characters fit into the early 19th century at all. The movie tries to joke about this. Ginger Isabelle occasionally pipes in with modern swear words that so lilted her dialog in GS1 but given that this movie never sounded 19th century anyway the comical contrast never works. Music was a plus in both the original and Unleashed. In this movie it is just awful. It sounds like they hired a single cellist to play four notes and then looped them repeatedly. Then there was Ginger's transformation at least they should have made it somewhat consistent with what occurred in GS1 instead of making her feverish and dizzy. Please. To see a young woman in that time period misbehaving Ginger did. THAT would have been exciting. What we got was boring. The rest of the cast tries with varying degrees of success. J. R. Bourne does well as the secondincommand but his character is just twodimensional the ahole dimension and the dchebag dimension. Hugh Dillon as the Reverend also a villain is allowed to overplay his part and his accent sounds jarringly anachronistic. In writing his role however it's apparent that the screenwriter took care to consult neither the Bible nor sermons written at the time. The Reverend's preaching sounds almost as nonsensical as the werewolf myth given at the beginning and I don't think it was deliberate. Matthew Walker as the doctor and Brendan Fletcher as Finn give very good performances and Fletcher's was so good I was surprised and saddened he did not have a larger part. Tom McCamus does a fair job as the fort commander or would have done one had the makeup department not given him such a silly wig. He almost makes it look dignified but his gravitas was one false move away from sidesplitting comedy. I think I'm the wrong gender and sexual orientation to judge Nathanial Arcand playing hunter.

	schema:headline " Atmospheric Romantic Dark Underrated";
	schema:reviewBody "After watching the first Ginger Snaps movie when I was baked out of my tree really made me LOVE the film because the tongue and cheek aspect of it totally made it so worth while. In my eyes it's an instant classic of it's own. By far the best damn Tongueincheek horror movie I have EVER seen. The second film? definitely not as good but I loved how it focused on Bridgette. Though in my eyes I really don't see why it should have had a sequel to it and most likely should have just been left alone. Though the sequel was good in it's own intentions it's feelingmood and total derangement of it made it seem so interesting.As for the prequel? well it's really no different not MEANT to be made if you look at it in the view of the first but it's cool that they did. Now if I were to pick a favorite of them I wouldn't know what to chose. Most likely the first movie because it's the movie that started the birth of the sequel and this movie too. However the first IS without a doubt THE BEST but just because it's the best does not mean I favor it. Personally I think I might just go with THIS movie because this is the only Ginger Snaps movie that I have any intention on reviewing. Exactly how often do I review movies? Not very often. Could it be that I don't have the time? no I have all the time in the world it's just that I never choose to do such a thing. As for this since I was SO intrigued by it I figure I might as well.Now all these movies have different't feels to them the first being a real tongueincheek horror movie with cheap gore aimed at horror fans and teens. The second movie? much more dark extremely serious aimed at teens and most probable fans of the first movie. The third taking a much more Gothic atmospheric romantic direction. That's why it's hard to pick but I LOVE Gothic atmospheric and romance anyways which is probably why I loved this one so much. Also because I had a much more lower expectation since what I heard nor did I realize it at the time.Personally something that I absolutely came to love was how in my perspective the star of the movie was NOT Ginger but Bridgette. The camera just seemed so drawn to her. Possibly could be because she's such a beautiful person and a favorite actress of my own thanks to IT. Don't get me wrong though Katharine is ALSO a very beautiful actress but she seems more like eye candy. There's something about Emily that I find totally beautiful could be the life and the spirit she brings to the film.There also was a little something about the movie I absolutely loved and that was the romance in it. Lots may not notice it and I believe that the romance in the film was NOT to be directly shown but to be more pointed out by the viewers. Yes I know that Bridgette and Ginger are sisters in the movie now not to sound like a pig because it's not about that but in it's own way they seemed to have a love for each other and NOT just in a sister way. It was more like romance and because of that the way it's portrayed was BEAUTIFULLY done if you appreciate it's much more subtle objective if that was the intention. There is something I would love to know why I loved this movie so much and to this day I cannot figure it out. All I am going to say is that I am more than glad that this movie got negative feedback from viewers and more than proud to say that I love this movie. Better than the first? NO WAY! totally different territories totally different meanings and just different movies in general. I loved that all of them were different from each other. Ginger Snaps Back has Dark atmosphere Beauty Romance and in it's own spirit love. Perhaps it's message is Love Is Thicker Than Blood.".

	onyx:emotionText "After watching the first Ginger Snaps movie when I was baked out of my tree really made me LOVE the film because the tongue and cheek aspect of it totally made it so worth while. In my eyes it's an instant classic of it's own. By far the best damn Tongueincheek horror movie I have EVER seen. The second film? definitely not as good but I loved how it focused on Bridgette. Though in my eyes I really don't see why it should have had a sequel to it and most likely should have just been left alone. Though the sequel was good in it's own intentions it's feelingmood and total derangement of it made it seem so interesting.As for the prequel? well it's really no different not MEANT to be made if you look at it in the view of the first but it's cool that they did. Now if I were to pick a favorite of them I wouldn't know what to chose. Most likely the first movie because it's the movie that started the birth of the sequel and this movie too. However the first IS without a doubt THE BEST but just because it's the best does not mean I favor it. Personally I think I might just go with THIS movie because this is the only Ginger Snaps movie that I have any intention on reviewing. Exactly how often do I review movies? Not very often. Could it be that I don't have the time? no I have all the time in the world it's just that I never choose to do such a thing. As for this since I was SO intrigued by it I figure I might as well.Now all these movies have different't feels to them the first being a real tongueincheek horror movie with cheap gore aimed at horror fans and teens. The second movie? much more dark extremely serious aimed at teens and most probable fans of the first movie. The third taking a much more Gothic atmospheric romantic direction. That's why it's hard to pick but I LOVE Gothic atmospheric and romance anyways which is probably why I loved this one so much. Also because I had a much more lower expectation since what I heard nor did I realize it at the time.Personally something that I absolutely came to love was how in my perspective the star of the movie was NOT Ginger but Bridgette. The camera just seemed so drawn to her. Possibly could be because she's such a beautiful person and a favorite actress of my own thanks to IT. Don't get me wrong though Katharine is ALSO a very beautiful actress but she seems more like eye candy. There's something about Emily that I find totally beautiful could be the life and the spirit she brings to the film.There also was a little something about the movie I absolutely loved and that was the romance in it. Lots may not notice it and I believe that the romance in the film was NOT to be directly shown but to be more pointed out by the viewers. Yes I know that Bridgette and Ginger are sisters in the movie now not to sound like a pig because it's not about that but in it's own way they seemed to have a love for each other and NOT just in a sister way. It was more like romance and because of that the way it's portrayed was BEAUTIFULLY done if you appreciate it's much more subtle objective if that was the intention.

The second sequel transports both characters to the 19th century Canadian wilderness. The good news is that the girls and their relationship is exactly the same as the first film. The bad news is that the first film took place in modern suburbia and the girls' characterization simply couldn't feel more out of place. It's like coming across a valley girl in a WWI Drama.Anachronisms aside what they really don't have from the first film is the witty banter and subtext of the story. The script is a true bare bones affair with that old Assault on Precinct 13 Rio Bravo plot. But instead of gang members our antagonists are werewolves. Now this plot can work mind you See Dog Soldiers for a perfect werewolves trapping people movie but with the first two Snaps films about puberty and addiction a trapped with crazy people plot line is quite a let down.The script is lazy in other ways as well. We have a ridiculous preacher character that would have been thrown out of 17th century Salem for being too fundamentalist and we also have endless Native American okay Native Canadian mumbo jumbo.There are very very few things that grate on my nerves faster in a movie than the wise Indian character with the endless intelligible incantations and feathered dream catchers. And of course they predict the future and give warnings of bad tidings and initially scare our girls but turn out to be the real good guys that everyone treats badly. Pretty generic and lazy screen writing.Needless to say the movie is all over the map. The end is good the werewolves look good and honestly I can watch Katharine Isabelle all day long. The plot however is a really a mess and Snaps really doesn't make much sense if you haven't seen the other two Ginger Snaps films and even less sense if you have.".

This is an enjoyable change from the mold the viewer gets to enjoy the continued adventures of characters sher enjoys with the benefit of experiencing something new.Ginger Snaps Back GSB was not only a clever way to keep the series going it also gave the cast and crew the opportunity to combine the best elements of the two previous films. Personally I liked Ginger Snaps Unleashed better than the first film because of the underdog character of Brigitte drove the action of the film I have a soft spot for second bananas. Brigitte also drives the main plot points of GSB but we still see Ginger leading the action as the brash and sassy red sister who eventually comes to embrace her lycanthropy. This combination of dualantagonists works well. Combine that with multiple references to the first two films and the introduction of a mythic component to the series and GSB is a winner.Some fans were disappointed about the fact that there were some mythic components to GSB. The first two films portray lycanthropy as a scientificmedical condition. What fans don't seem to realize is that GSB does this as well the Hunter and the Seer merely speak of the legend of the wendigo that the white man brought with him from oversees. The added aspect of the legend of the two sisters one black and one red is more of a meta component of the film  that is not an attempt to explain lycanthropy it's an attempt to explain the series  a post modern move on the part of the writer.Fans also complain that the sisters do not share the dark death obsessed bond they have in the first film. Again I disagree. Both sisters have secrets about their parents death and an extremely close bond. There darkness was accentuated in different ways from the first film after all there were no disposable cameras and slide shows in the 19th century.My only complaint about GSB is that at times the dialog is rather anachronistic. Yet for the most part the cast does a believable job. Also it was wise that the director chose not to go the route of 19th centuryspeaking that would cut off the audience's main point of entry to the film.Overall GSB is a great ending to a great trilogy. For successful conclusions rarely wrap up a series they often make you rethink the previous films and the canon or continuity of the characters.".

The question of their immortal soul can be resolved later.Also I guess this relates to the rest of the trilogy these girls are supposed to be the protagonists?

Brigitte  ginger's sister try's everything to find a cure for hear sister. Its  isn't a success.   Now onto Ginger snaps back.. This film is a very odd Idea. It has  Brigitte and Ginger in it but it is a prequel that takes place in 19th  century canada. Brigitte and Ginger are out in the cold woods and  stumble into an Indian who takes them to a trading village to get out  of the cold. Brigitte and Ginger are not welcomed with open arms at the  village. The village is nearly empty and low on food due to the fact  that all the men who went for supplies never came back.  Everyone thinks they never came back because they were all killed by  the werewolves. This movie starts off really well. I really enjoy  period piece films and this film succeeds at that The sets in the film  were amazing and all the actors were very good. I thought the film was  kinda similar to Ravenous. The film starts to weaken once Ginger is  bitten by the generals son who was bitten by a wolf and is turning.  After Ginger is bitten she starts changing it gets boring. The first  30min of this film was great but the last hour was poor. I would  recommend seeing it but it is in no way a 4 star film. 24".

A cannonball tears through it making her head a gaping hole. Now Bosko is angry.

It's definitely the funniest Bosko cartoon I've seen and although I doubt I'm in the same critical league as my fellow reviewers here I've seen enough Bosko to know what the usual humor level in one is. So what were my favorite parts? The violence for sure that slaps you in the face like a very early Popeye fight only in this the cartoon characters croak! The part with the flea caught me totally unprepared and actually made me laugh out loud very loudly! The animation is really good much better then I was expecting. It's on par with stuff Warner was doing in the 40's maybe even better there are a lot of details going on and movement. Highly recommend it for adult viewer's for kids too if they are at least preteen. As far as one reviewers question about what war it was Doughboy is a nickname for American soldiers in World War One so there you go. It is not going to demonize an enemy since it was made in 1931 and Germany was at peace with the world. The same things would happen after World War Two where cartoon characters may be in the war but the enemy is unseen. You don't want to ruin a countries market not only for that cartoon but also all the movies you are making with bad press. You also see that happening in TV series where although you see the enemy most times they are not demonized unless SS or Gestapo and their abilities are made more respectful so as not to offend that countries market from selling your TV shows and movies in it. For Bosko The Doughboy I rank it a 10 of 10 on the scale of all the Bosko episodes and a 9 of 10 for cartoons I really liked it.".

One thing that we learned in Catch22 is that ...anyone with a gun is the enemy. Of course I'm sure that the people behind the cartoon never intended for the cartoon to merit such a complex interpretation. I have no doubt that they envisioned it as pure entertainment. Not that it contains much in the way of entertainment. I believe that I speak for most Looney Tunes fans when I say that the Looney Tunes' golden age began with Porky Pig's debut in Friz Freleng's I Haven't Got a Hat in 1935.".

Overall it's animated well but also a bit unsavory. Plus some might raise an eyebrow at the ending with its cheap attempt at humor Bosko is burnt to a crisp and does an Al Jolson imitation.

Or the one where after a friend of Bosko's gets a cannonball stuck in his stomach Bosko gets it out by simply zipping down his front part and taking the ball out of there! Or the one where the dog soldier has fleas so Bosko solves the problem by getting his metal hat riddled with bullets so with the holes filled in the dog uses it to scratch his back!

Or the one where after a friend of Bosko's gets a cannonball stuck in his stomach Bosko gets it out by simply zipping down his front part and taking the ball out of there! Or the one where the dog soldier has fleas so Bosko solves the problem by getting his metal hat riddled with bullets so with the holes filled in the dog uses it to scratch his back! Like I said pretty grim with gallows humor abound. Still worth a look for any early Warner Bros. animation enthusiast.";

	schema:reviewBody "In 1931 Roy Del Ruth became the first director to bring Dashiell Hammett's THE MALTESE FALCON to the screen. Although it received favorable reviews and did a brisk business at the box office like many early talkies it was soon eclipsed by everadvancing technology and forgottenuntil television with its endless demands for latelate show material knocked on Hollywood's door. Retitled DANGEROUS FEMALE in order to avoid confusion with the highly celebrated 1941 version it has haunted the airwaves ever since.DANGEROUS FEMALE is interesting in several ways and perhaps most deeply so as an example of the struggle that ensued when sound first roared. What had proved effective on the silent screen suddenly seemed highly mannered when voices were added and both directors and stars struggled to find new techniquesand DANGEROUS FEMALE offers a very vision of the issues involved.It is a myth that the advent of sound forced directors to lock down the camera but it is true that many directors preferred simple camera setups in early sound films it gave them one less thing to worry about. And with this film Roy Del Ruth is no exception in a visual sense DANGEROUS FEMALE is fairly static. The performing decisions made by the various actors are also illustrative and informative particularly re leads Ricardo Cortez and Bebe Daniels. Cortez is still clearly performing in the silent mode and he reads as visually loud Daniels however has elected to underplay and while she is stiff by current standards her performance must have seemed startlingly innovative at the time. And then there are two performers who are very much of the technology Una Merkle as Spade's secretary and Thelma Todd as Iva Archer both of whom seem considerably more comfortable with the new style than either Cortez or Daniels.The film is also interesting as a PreCode picture for it is sexually explicit in ways most viewers will not expect from a 1930s film and indeed it is surprisingly explicit even in comparison to other precode films. Hero Sam Spade is a womanizer who seduces every attractive female who crosses his pathand the film opens with a shot of just such a woman pausing to straighten her stockings before leaving his office. Still later the dubious Miss Wonderly tempts Spade with her cleavage lolls in his bed after a thick night splashes in his bathtub and finally winds up stripped naked in his kitchen! It is also interesting of course to compare DANGEROUS FEMALE to its two remakes. Directed by William Dieterle and starring Warren William and Bette Davis the 1936 Satan MET A LADY would put Hammett's plot through the wringerand prove a critical disaster and a box office thud. But then there is the justly celebrated 1941 version starring Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor under the direction of John Huston.Both the 1931 and 1941 films lifted great chunks of dialogue from Hammett's novel and very often the dialogue is lineforline the same. But two more completely different films could scarcely be imagined. Where the 1931 film strives for an urbane quality the 1941 film is memorably grittyand in spite of being hampered by the production considerably more sexually suggestive as well implying the homosexuality of several characters much more effectively than the 1931 version dared.In the final analysis the 1931 THE MALTESE FALCON aka DANGEROUS FEMALE will appeal most to those interested in films that illustrate the transition between silent film and sound to collectors of precode movies and to hardcore FALCON fans who want everything associated with Hammett his novel and the various film versions. But I hesitate to recommend it generally if you don't fall into one of those categories you're likely to be unimpressed.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon reviewer".

But it was the third crack that Warner Brothers took at Dashiell Hammett's breakthrough novel.  Probably best forgotten is the 1936 Satan Met A Lady where a bejewelled ram's horn subbed for the black bird even Bette Davis couldn't salvage the movie.  But this first filming later retitled Dangerous Female made the year after the novel's release  in the technical infancy of the sound era  retains enough punch and flavor to give the formidable forties version a run for its money.Starring as Sam Spade and Miss Wonderly who never becomes Brigid O'Shaughnessey are Ricardo Cortez and Bebe Daniels the talkies' first immortal guygal team.  And joining them is the familiar ensemble of grotesques As Dr.' Joel Cairo Otto Mathiessen as Casper Gutman Dudley Digges who lacking Sidney Greenstreet's girth is never called The Fat Man and as Wilmer the gunsel gimleteyed Dwight Frye familiar from the Dracula and Frankenstein franchises.  And while Huston's cast in each instance has the edge it's not by much  these pioneering hams have a field day.Huston trusted Hammett enough to preserve more of his astringent dialogue intact but Dangerous Woman shows surprising fidelity to the book.  The subplot about Spade's affair with his slain partner's wife Iva Archer stays prominent and the merry widow is played by Thelma Todd herself later to fall victim in one of Hollywood's most notorious unsolved murders. Owing to less prudish times before the Hayes Office tried to make sex unAmerican the scene is kept where Spade in his quest for a palmed 1000 bill makes Wonderly strip naked though left largely offscreen.  And in calling Wilmer Gutman's boyfriend' Spade makes a mite more explicit their oldqueenroughtrade dynamic.Roy del Ruth who directed was an old newspaper man who came to Hollywood in the silent era racking up a workmanlike list of credits in 1949 he would return to San Francisco locales for the unusual noir Red Light.   He adds some deft touches as when after Spade departs with her bankroll Wonderly blithely extracts a fat wad of bills from her stocking. Much of what he might be credited for however may be inadvertent.  Since the novel was published and the movie made on that critical cusp between the Roaring Twenties and Old Man Depression an authentic period tang asserts itself  Daniels' marcelled hair for instance not to mention the Viennaborn Cortez' being palmed off as a Latin lover.  The movie deviates from the novel in ending with a scene in the women's house of detention that manages to be simultaneously sassy and poignant. Dangerous Female offers an instructive lesson in how the various versions with their differing tones and emphases shed their own light and shadow on a classic American crime novel.".

	schema:reviewBody "I got such a kick out of this filmed version of Dashiell Hammett's detective novel that I think I was grinning from ear to ear throughout the movie. Because it was a precode film it was much more open to the sexiness of the original novel for instance here we have Miss Wonderly Bebe Daniels in the role played by Mary Astor in the 1941 version actually undressing in the kitchen scene. In another scene when she claims someone is following her and she is frightened to be alone Sam Spade Ricardo Cortez who is much more handsome than Bogart offers her his bedroom for the night. You can have my bed I'll sleep out here. She turns to him coyly from the sofa and says Aw don't let me keep you out. I burst out laughing. Couldn't imagine this repartee between Bogie and Astor! Una Merkel was superb as the devoted secretary of Sam Spade. She constantly gives off the aura that she has had a physical relationship with him in the past and that some of it still hangs around even though it is essentially over note their sitting real closely on a chair in one scene lingeringly holding hands. Thelma Todd plays Archer's wife who has also had an affair with Sam in the past and she adds some more spice to the film which is already loaded with it compared to the 1941 version which was made under the control of the Hollywood Production Code. The other cast members are wonderful including Dudley Digges as Casper Gutman Otto Matieson as Joel Cairo and Dwight Frye as the psychotic Wilma Cook. They completely hold your attention and are just as interesting perhaps even more so than the 1941 version actors. I am a Bogie fan but Ricardo Cortez steals the picture with this performance. He is a much more selfish less noble character than Bogie's Sam Spade and that makes him more interesting to watch on screen. For instance in the 1941 version Bogie's Sam Spade reluctantly gives over the girl to the police because when your partner is murdered you are supposed to do something about it. In the 1931 version Ricardo's Sam Spade hands her over simply because he himself doesn't want to be charged with murder. He's saving his own neck not acting out of some false loyalty to a partner he didn't even like. In fact in this version Ricardo as Sam states firmly I couldn't shed a tear for Archer dead OR alive. This is a lot more honest and realistic.Don't miss your chance to see this early talkie gem. It is fascinating to watch on its own merits and also to compare with the later more famous Bogart version.".

	schema:reviewBody "As everyone knows by now at least if they're on this IMDb page! this was the original film version of The Maltese Falcon. And of course it being precode is a lot sexier than the Bogart version which is to say comparable to a racy 1970s TV movie. We see Miss Wonderley sleeping in Spade's bed and actually see her naked in the bathtub from the shoulders up at one point. As in Satan Met a Lady the detective is made out to be a sleazy ladies' man in this movie. When we first see him he's kissing a woman goodbye we never actually see her face but we see her adjusting her stocking and when Sam returns to his office the pillows from his couch are in disarray. He seems to be getting some from Effie as well and I must point out that Una Merkel as Effie is hot hot hot in this movie quite a contrast to the matronly Lee Patrick in the 1941 version.Overall though this movie is still somewhat unsatisfying. I suppose if we had never seen the BogartHuston version this would stand as an acceptable adaptation of Hammett's novel by the standards of the time. It follows the novel fairly closely but skimps on the plot somewhat. The subplot where Wonderley disappears and then reappears as O'Shaughnessy because she realizes Gutman is in town is missing as is all the great interplay between Spade and Wilmer Just keep riding me buster This'll put you in solid with your boss etc. that was such a treat in the later version. True this movie is a little more explicit about the relationship between Gutman and Wilmer but Wilmer is such a minor character with literally only a few minutes of screen time that their relationship still seems more fullydeveloped in the 1941 movie. There's also a very odd change at the end just before the prison scene that seems like something of a copout.And finally it must be pointed out that Ricardo Cortez really stinks in this movie. He spends most of the movie with a smirk plastered on his face and his performance in general is extremely stiff. I suppose that's to be expected in such an early talkie but combined with the general aura of sleaziness that his character exudes it makes it impossible to really care what happens to him. In the end this is an enjoyable movie but mainly for reasons of historical curiosity and it never comes anywhere near the classic status that the later remake has achieved.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen this version of Maltese Falcon three times from offtheair taping. Of course it follows the same basic plot line of the 1941 film but that early film noir classic becomes more like a morality play with relatively little emotion. From the start Sam Spade is portrayed as a ladies man an approach validated by the smooth good looks of Ricardo Cortez and his urbane manner. It is difficult to imagine a first shot of a woman's legs coming out of Sam's office as the first shot of the 1941 film in light of Bogart's understated performance. Moreover one gets a strong impression that there is a real attraction between Cortez and Daniels conveyed not so much by the scene in Sam's apartment with its bathtub scene and her stripping in his bedroom where she has spent the night rather in the last scene where Sam is visiting her in her prison cell instead of turning her over to the police with no regrets as in 1941 and tells the matron to provide her with every luxury she wants and we see her alone in the cell weeping and bitterly commenting on their? love. There are other interesting features. Whereas in 1941 a homosexual relationship between Greenstreet and Lorre lay beneath the surface in this film Gutman strokes Wilmer as my own son and seems truly troubled at the thought of giving him up as the fall guy. Dwight Frye as Wilmer has only a few lines but gives his usual expressive performance of mental unbalance without the hardness of Elisha Cook Jr. in 1941. It's interesting for me to speculate how I would have evaluated the 1941 film if I had seen this one first and used it as the basis for comparison.".

Since it's 1931 and therefore precode the emphasis is on sex and Sam's libidinous nature. In the first scene a woman leaves his office straightening the seams in her stockings. Bebe Daniels as Ms. Wonderly takes a bath in Sam's tub strips in the kitchen  you name it. Thelma Todd is on hand as the wife of Spade's partner Miles Archer who if you know the story gets it in the first reel. Sam's had a thing with her too. He keeps them all on the hook.I found this version slow going mainly because it's an early talkie  the dialogue pacing isn't quite right. You can drive a truck through the pauses. The only one with a more modern feel for the dialogue is the handsome smiling Cortez and he's absolutely marvelous as Spade. His Spade is more relaxed than Bogie's less sardonic more delightfully crooked  in short he has a lot more fun. He fits just as well into this version as worldweary Bogie does into the 1941 version.Bebe Daniels is attractive and alluring as the greedy and totally ruthless Miss Wonderly. The gay subplot between Greenstreet and Lorre everyone assumes isn't as apparent in this film between Wilmer Dwight Frye and Caspar Guttman Dudley Digges.I found the comments in the first post on the actors' approaches to their roles very interesting I'm not sure I totally agree but for sure Cortez spoke louder and Daniels did underplay which she did not do in 42nd Street  at all. However as far as the pace I still Cortez did better in keeping the dialogue going than anyone else.This is a fascinating film  so different from the 1941 version which I hope to see this evening  it's definitely worth catching.".

	schema:reviewBody "It might have been wise to watch the two earlier versions of Dashiell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon before I rewatched the 1941 classic. It would have reminded me just how great Huston's film is. The '31 version isn't bad per se. It has the same major flaw that most films of this early talkie era had leaden dialogue delivery. It's also a bit stagy though by no means the worst I've seen from the time. None of the actors are as good as their '41 counterparts with the possible exception of Bebe Daniels most famous for her role in 42nd Street. She's a bit sexier than Mary Astor and it's more believable that she could hold sway over men. I also thought Otto Matieson was pretty good as Joel Cairo. Una Merkel is very cute as Effie Spade's secretary. Thelma Todd of Marx Brothers' movies fame also costars as Iva Archer. Ricardo Cortez plays Sam. He's a bit too nice for the part like he should rather be starring in musicals Daniels doesn't suffer this way  she's appropriately ruthless. The film only runs 78 minutes but it feels a lot longer. It excises even more of the novel than Huston's version but the pacing is really slow the '41 movie runs 100 minutes. It seems the major success in Huston's movie  well besides the awesome cast  was its lightning pacing. It also changes some things around at the end if I remember right. I actually really liked the final sequence not in the '41 version and if memory serves me correctly not in the novel either where Spade visits Ms. Wonderly which isn't a pseudonym in this movie in prison. I wouldn't say it surpasses the '41 version in any way but then again I've never quite been satisfied with Spade's final exchanges with Brigid O'Shaughnessy either.".

It seemed to me that the later used the same script and set the action in the same or very nearly the same scene.I also found Ricardo Cortez and Bebe Daniels more convincing in the leading roles.  For instance in both versions there is an exchange between Sam Spade and his police buddy where Sam says something like ...what do I know about women ! and his police buddy replies since when.  These lines are just throwaway in the later version as this aspect of Sam's character has not been defined properly for the viewer.  However in the earlier version the viewer already has some idea that Sam is a ladies' man and can turn on the charm.Likewise the Miss O'Shaughnessy character is obviously meant to be a femme fatale for whom men fall and gladly sacrifice themselves for her.  Bebe Daniels plays this role to perfection and fits the bill far more satisfyingly and believably than does Mary Astor in the later version.The earlier version is more convincing in portraying the charged atmosphere and obvious attraction that Sam Spade and Miss O'Shaughnessy have towards one another.  Consequently it makes the scene between the two of them later and the dilemma Sam faces between handing her over to the police to face the music Don't be silly you'll take the fall and like it ! and ...sure I'll have some sleepless nights... and not implicating her to the police more poignant.Having said that no one could better Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre in their respective roles.  Majestic magnificent and they never stop playing their roles even when they are in the background of a scene e.g. Peter Lorre when Sidney is whispering a warning to Humphrey in his Sam Spade's flat and Peter Joel Cairo interrupts the putting into his mouth and lighting of a cigarette to focus his attention on Sam Spade and 'Fatman' Gutman.".

	schema:headline " Practically the 1941 version throughout much of the film!";
	schema:reviewBody "This film like the 1941 version of the same movie is about a group of rogues searching for a famed gold and jewel encrusted statue. Along the way greed resulted in the murders of several people and the police suspect Sam Spade Ricardo Cortez for the murdersor at least thinking he knows far more than he's admitting.While the 1941 version of THE MALTESE FALCON has become a classic this original version from 1931 is oddly forgotten. While I could understand a little of this after all Bogart was better as Sam Spade it's not fair that the 1931 be given its just due. That's because much of this 1931 film is copied wordforword in 1941making the 1941 a rather by the numbers remake. Sure there are improvements here and there but nothing essentially groundbreaking or significantly different.So how is the original better and worse than the 1941 film? Well it's better because Spade is grittier and more amoralmuch more like you'd think a real private eye might be. Plus since it is original I usually feel that original's are best and deserve to be seen. On the negative side the 1931 film is lacking much of the wonderful incidental music. This was common for films in 1931 but the 1941 movie sounds better and this makes the film come alive. The pace is also much better in 1941as the film is less rushed and hence unfolds better. Also Bogart was a bit better in the leada bit more rugged and bigger than life. Finally the tacked on ending in the 1931 film was unnecessary and actually blunted the impact on the final confrontation scene.Now one way they are VERY different but which is neither better nor worse is that the 1931 film was made before the strengthened Production Code was enforced. This allowed Spade to be much more of a sexual Lothario and there was a scene where it strongly implied that he'd had sex with Bebe Daniels' charactersomething that did NOT happen in the later film.Overall this is a terrific filmespecially since it was so much better than the average fare of the day. While not quite as good as the 1941 version it's so close that frankly it's almost a toss up as to which is best. Despite all the hype the 1931 FALCON is a great film and one not to be missed by film historians and lovers of PreCode cinema.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film like the 1941 version of the same movie is about a group of rogues searching for a famed gold and jewel encrusted statue. Along the way greed resulted in the murders of several people and the police suspect Sam Spade Ricardo Cortez for the murdersor at least thinking he knows far more than he's admitting.While the 1941 version of THE MALTESE FALCON has become a classic this original version from 1931 is oddly forgotten. While I could understand a little of this after all Bogart was better as Sam Spade it's not fair that the 1931 be given its just due. That's because much of this 1931 film is copied wordforword in 1941making the 1941 a rather by the numbers remake. Sure there are improvements here and there but nothing essentially groundbreaking or significantly different.So how is the original better and worse than the 1941 film? Well it's better because Spade is grittier and more amoralmuch more like you'd think a real private eye might be. Plus since it is original I usually feel that original's are best and deserve to be seen. On the negative side the 1931 film is lacking much of the wonderful incidental music.

Not that this isn't a serviceable story it is but if you've seen the Bogey crew in action there's no comparison at least for this viewer.I never read the Dashiell Hammett novel so I don't know which Sam Spade more closely resembles the literary version. I can say though that I didn't care for the Ricardo Cortez portrayal here all that much. Perhaps it's because he was a flagrant womanizer or because he didn't trade barbs with Polhaus J. Farrel MacDonald and Dundy Robert Elliott with the sardonic wit of Bogart's Spade. On the flip side though the fact that Spade understood Chinese was an interesting idea it's not till late in the story that we learn that Lee Fu Gow told Spade who killed his partner. So he knew all along and kept it close to the vest to see how things played out.Character for character matchups between the two pictures makes it a hands down proposition for the later film. How can you top Greenstreet Lorre and Elisha Cook Jr. as the heavies compared to the statue hunters here? As Ruth Wonderly Bebe Daniels uses only one name in the story compared to Mary Astor's character and Sam's secretary in this version portrayed by Una Merkel gave every indication that she had a past present or future in the romance department with her boss. Bogart's Spade wisely kept his hands to himself around his secretary maintaining a professional relationship instead of a lecherous one.I guess there are those who'll see things just the other way around with this precode version of The Falcon. There's something to be said for the free wheeling attitude displayed toward sexual innuendo in the story. It helps explain how Miss Wonderly wound up with a woman's kimono in Sam's apartment  it belonged to partner Archer's wife!! I did get a big kick out of one thing that blows by pretty quickly if one is not attentive to it. Listen carefully when Sam Spade makes a call to Effie's home phone  her number is Berkeley Double O7! It would be a couple decades before writer Ian Fleming came up with that designation for his secret agent James Bond! I wonder if he saw this picture.".

She had made the transition with ease apart from being dropped by Paramount because they didn't think she could talk but she soon put them wise. Apart from a few early musicals the roles she was given were shady ladies dutiful secretaries or mistresses. The vivacity and impish appeal that had made her silents such fun was gone.The Maltese Falcon also went under the title Dangerous Female when it was released to TV so it wouldn't be confused with the later Humphrey Bogart classic. It was also identified as The Woman in the Floral Pyjamas and has some of the raciest sexiest scenes I have ever seen in a precode movie and along with Baby Face it was one of the films that hastened the dreaded Breen Code of 1934.The movie positively oozed sex  from the opening shot of a woman client adjusting her stockings as she kisses Sam a fond farewell. Is there something going on between Sam and Ettie Una Merkel?? I don't think so  Ettie seems too smart for that and she is the one constant in his life besides he simply doesn't have the time!!! He has just met Mrs. Wonderly Bebe Daniels when who should phone up but Iva Archer Thelma Todd upset because he has been ignoring her. Another person who overhears the conversation is Miles Archer Walter Long but before he has time to teach his two timing wife a lesson he is shot in an alley.Ricardo Cortez is no Humphrey Bogart  I don't mean that in a putting down way. Cortez plays Sam Spade as a flinty smart alecky womaniser with a sprinkling of humour also a sprinkling of good taste as well  I am sure that was a photo of Louise Brooks in his apartment. Bogart played him as world weary but someone you could sympathise with. Of the three villains  no one could put more menace into the phrase I'm a man who likes to talk to a man who likes to talk than Sidney Greenstreet but Dudley Digges was excellent in the role. He certainly didn't have the domineering presence of Greenstreet who did? but he specialised in roles of quiet evil The Mayor of Hell Massacre. I thought Dwight Frye was more than a match for Elisha Cook Jnr  he didn't have as much to do and he only uttered a few lines but he bought a vulnerability to his role. The person I thought let the team down was Bebe Daniels. Don't get me wrong I really love Bebe in the silents and in some of her talkies Silver Dollar Counsellor at Law she matched John Barrymore in sincerity and 42nd Street she played her role with a lot of feeling. I just think Mary Astor played the role with more warmth and sincerity so you really cared about what happened to her at the end. Bebe just didn't seem to have the emotional depth.The two people I really loved in this movie were Walter Long so fantastic as the hardened criminal who takes an intense dislike to Laurel and Hardy in Pardon Us and Thelma Todd. There is another sexy scene in this movie where Iva bursts into Sam's apartment sees Bebe and shouts What is she doing in my dressing gown!!! The way Bebe takes it off  like it is poison!!! Anyway Thelma Todd and Walter Long play Mr. and Mrs. Archer. Walter Long married to Thelma Todd  that is surely the stuff that dreams are made of  his dreams!!!Highly Highly Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this original precode 1931 version of The Maltese Falcon titled Dangerous Female on the big screen in 1994  I was shocked  impressed by just how good it was  it gives the classic 1941 version a run for it's money. For it's an interesting historical curiosity. I can see why this version was very successful  well received in 1931 but I can also see why it was soon forgotten.Having read the novel by Dashiell Hammett detective Sam Spade was a ladies man but not to the extent to where Ricardo Cortez took him. Cortez went too far  was a bit excessive  extreme even for a precode movie. Spade was also a hard boiled cynical private eye with a code of ethics. Cortez did capture this to a certain point when he wasn't womanizing.Because of it's suggestive sexual explicitness this version was not rereleased when the strict censorship code was enforced in 1934 governing morality  decency. This original version deviates from the book considerably  only touched on the original story  the cast is not that memorable for the most part with the exception of Dwight Frye we all know him from Dracula  Frankenstein.Ricardo Cortez Otto Matiesen  Dudley Digges pales in comparison to their 1941 counterparts more stronger screen presence of Humphrey Bogart Peter Lorre  Sydney Greenstreet in their respective roles as Sam Spade Joel Cairo  Kasper Gutman the fatman. I will say that it's a toss up with Dwight Frye  Elisha Cook Jr. as Wilmer the gunsel. Both were equally good  right for the part.As for the females Bebe Daniels Thelma Todd  Una Merkel are very sexually seductive exciting women more so than Mary Astor Gladys George  Lee Patrick respectively as Brigid Wonderly Iva Archer  Spades secretary Effie. Even though the women in the 1941 version were less appealing for some reason they were more memorable than the more sizzling hot women in the 1931 version. Although I don't think Mary Astor was a great Brigid I think Bette Davis or Barbara Stanwyck would've been better.It was these factors in addition to the definitive indelible 1941 version that contributed to why this precode version was reduced to a dim memory. Did people even remember this version by 1941 ?? Of the 3 versions of The Maltese Falcon it was the John Huston directed film that was the most faithful  closest adaptation that stayed true to Dashiell Hammett's book.It was John Huston's direction giving the film a dark cynical gloomy  atmospheric quality that permeates through the entire story. And the dramatic use of lighting  shadows  the expressive camerawork of Arthur Edeson bringing us into the world of film noir. This is why the 1941 version became the enduring classic cinematic quintessential prototype private detective thriller. Something that the 1931 version lacks to some extent.But this original version should be seen  enjoyed in it's own right as a forerunner to the later classic  also as a historical reference point as to what these early talkies were like before 1934. I would like to see this version again  obtain a copy on DVD  watch it back to back with the '41 classic. If you're into precode cinema by all means see this original version.".

For it's an interesting historical curiosity. I can see why this version was very successful  well received in 1931 but I can also see why it was soon forgotten.Having read the novel by Dashiell Hammett detective Sam Spade was a ladies man but not to the extent to where Ricardo Cortez took him.

The just finished screening of this 1931 original screen version THE MALTESE FALCON has brought us just about directly to the old keyboard. While we saw many differences the end result was that of great satisfaction.BEING DONE A full decade before the John Huston directedwritten screenplay had by virtue of its belonging to a new era of film a very different mood feel and appearance. Although there are so many of the typically Warner Brothers' elements in both the earlier one bore a rather intimate relationship to the Silents which had of course just recently rode off into the sunset. Its Humphrey Bogart vehicle remake had the advantage of all of the elements of the highly developed and polished Warner product of the 1940's war years. In essence it was the Warner Brothers movie being at the very zenith of their power.BEING THAT THIS production is one of the precode era there is a lot of material that is while not necessarily explicit very highly implied. We are referring mainly to the sublet of SEX. We see ladies' man now called a womanizer in today's vernacular in several highly 'adult' situations always in the company of females. The opening scene has Sam revealed to be in a 'private' conference with a briefly shown 'flapper' who has to adjust her stockings before departing his office. Mr. Spade then tidies up his couch having to pick up the multitude of throw pillows that are scattered about the floor.HID LATER MEETING with Miss Wonderly include their sharing his apartment for the night. Although any even partial nudity and simulated sex is never shown there's no doubt in our minds. The nudity and intercourse were about 40 years ahead in the Hollywood of the '70's IN DEFENSE OF this original version of the FALCON in many respects the plot seems to be somewhat clearer to we the audience. This applies mainly to understanding the relationships between those contesting for possession of the Black Bird. HAVING VIEWED THIS '31 version for the first time today after years of familiarity with the latter provided us with a sort of scrambling of our TimeSpace continuum. The only previous similar experiences were in viewing some other previously made movies after the later more familiar. They are THE SPIRIT OF NOTER DAME Universal 1931 which in many ways laid the foundation for Warner Brothers KNUTE ROCKNE ALLAmerican 1940 RIO BRAVO Warners 1959remade as EL DORADO and especially ZERO HOUR Paramount 1957 which was fractured and remade into AIRPLANE 1980.ANY REVIEW OF this film must refer to the casting that was done. Of course we had Bogart in for Ricardo Cortez Spade and Bebe Daniels giving away to Mary Astor's Miss Wunderly. Others who were very different than the later cast members are Walter LongJerome Cowan Miles Archer J. Farrell McDonaldWard Bond Det. Sgt. Tom Pohlhaus0 Una MerkelLee Patrick EssieThelma ToddGladys George Iva Archer.BUT FOR OUR money the two roles that are so different in casting are that of Dudley Diggs to Sydney Greenstreet's Casper Gutman as the mannerisms were similar but where's the bulk Diggs ? The other is Dwight Frye to Elisha Cook Jr. as Wilmer. Dwight had a lot less to do and only a few lines. He was also the king of the creepy characters in the 1930's Universal horror epics. Elisha's characterization was able to fully develop that of a psychotic killer. Oddly enough or maybe because of this fact Wilmer's surname is given in the '31 version but not in the latter. It is Cook! WE GIVE THIS on many thumbs up and recommend it to any and all !".

	schema:headline " A more primitive but sexier version of the Dashiell Hammett novel";
	schema:reviewBody "Roy Del Ruth directed the original adaptation of the Dashiell Hammett novel in 1931 which starred Ricardo Cortez. In a nutshell THE MALTESE FALCON told the story about a San Francisco private detective named Sam Spade who finds himself drawn into a search for a valuable falcon statuette first created during the Crusades while investigating three murders.The story began with a Miss Ruth Wonderly hiring Spade and his partner Miles Archer to find her missing sister and a man named Floyd Thursby. When Thursby and Archer end up murdered Spade discovered that Miss Wonderly is one of three people searching for a statuette called the Maltese Falcon. A mortally wounded ship's captain delivered the statuette to Spade's office before dropping dead making him the case's third murder victim. The entire case spiraled into a game of catandmouse between Spade Miss Wonderly a wealthy fat Englishman named Caspar Gutman and an effeminate continental European named Dr. Joel Cairo. Spade also had to deal with the police who are determined to pin the three deaths on him. In the end this version turned out better than I had expected. However the movie is not without its faults. There were times when I felt I was watching a filmed play very common with early talking movies. But the film's main problem seemed to be its pacing. It seemed too slow for what was supposed to be a witty murder mystery. Especially during the first half hour. By the time Joel Cairo was introduced into the story the pacing finally began to pick up. The dialogue provided by screenwriters Maude Fulton Brown Holmes and an unaccredited Lucien Hubbard failed to improve over the course of the movie. Not only did the screenplay allow the dialogue to drag throughout the entire film the latter was not that memorable.Considering that this is the only precode version of the film it is not surprising that this version is considered the sexiest of the three filmed versions of the novel. Del Ruth along with Fulton Holmes and Hubbard did an excellent job of conveying the womanizing aspect of Spade's character by revealing his affairs with Archer's wife Iva his casual flirtation with his secretary Effie and visual hints of his relationship with Ruth Wonderly like a small indent in the pillow next to the client's head which hinted that Spade had spent the night with her. Other signs of precode sexuality included Spade bidding a female client goodbye at the beginning of the movie a nude Miss Wonderly in a bathtub and a hint of a homosexual relationship between Caspar Gutman and his young enforcer Wilmer Cook.This version lacked the sharp wit of the 1941 adaptation. Considering that I have never read the novel the screenplay did allow me to completely understand the story in full detail for the first time without leaving me in a slight haze of fog. I found nothing memorable about William Rees' photography or Robert M. Haas' art direction except in one scene. The scene in question featured an exterior setting namely a street in San Francisco's Chinatown where Miles Archer's body was discovered. I suspect that this particular scene gave both Rees and Haas an opportunity to display their artistry beyond the movie's usual interior settings.There is also a solid cast here. Ricardo Cortez led the cast as detective Sam Spade. Cortez gave a very sexy interpretation of Spade in his performance. His constant smirks and grins in the film's first ten to fifteen minutes seemed annoying. But in the end Cortez grew on me. I can honestly say that not only did I find him very effective in portraying a sexy Sam Spade he also managed to superbly capture the character's cynical humor toughness and deep contempt toward the police.Bebe Daniels another survivor from the silent era portrayed Ruth Wonderly and this role has to be considered as one of her best. She managed to give an excellent performance as the ladylike yet manipulative woman who drew Spade into the labyrinth search for the Maltese Falcon. Mind you she lacked Mary Astor's throbbing voice and nervous manner. But that is merely a minor hitch. Daniels still managed to portray a very convincing elegant temptress. Irishborn Dudley Digges portrayed the wealthy and obsessive Caspar Gutman who is not above murder bribery and a score of other crimes to acquire the falcon statuette. Digges lacked the style to believably portray a man wealthy enough to conduct a twentyyear search for a valuable artifact. Instead Digges reminded me of a corrupt minor official at a British post in the tropics. He seemed to lack talent and subtlety for infusing menace into his character. Whenever he tried to menacing he only ended up giving a hammy performance. On the other hand Otto Matieson gave a more believable performance as Dr. Joel Cairo Gutman's Continental accomplice. Matieson portrayed Cairo as a nononsense and practical man who is careful with his money and with whom to trust it.Una Merkel gave a humorous performance as Spade's Girl Friday Effie. Her Effie is not hesitant about expressing her attraction to Spade yet at the same time she seemed to find the detective's other amorous activities rather amusing. Todd seemed to be trying too hard as a scorned lover without any subtlety. At least Dwight Frye fared better as Gutman's young enforcer Wilmer Cook. He did a solid job in conveying the portrait of a babyfaced killer.I'd suggest watching the 1931 version and the 1941 versions back to back to get an idea of how Warner Brothers grew up during the 1930s. Remember they were just a poverty row studio mainly known for their Rin Tin Tin silent until The Jazz Singer made them rich.".

Bogart was scowling and all business but here he is genial and smiling.Ricardo Cortez plays Spade but was not nearly the actor Bogart was. There are similarities between the two versions but are not exact copies of one another. This earlier one is easier to follow but the crucial role of the femme fatale suffers with Bebe Daniels in the part. She was no match for Mary Astor. Dudley Digges plays Casper Gutman almost as well as Sidney Greenstreet who must have patterned his part after Digges's. But Greenstreet's was a more idiosyncratic portrayal and not nearly as eccentric. And Peter Lorre was a more fascinating Cairo and combined with Greenstreet they made a more explosive team. Left out for obvious reasons was a scene in which Spade is looking for a missing 1000 bill and makes Bebe Daniels strip offscreen to prove she didn't steal it. This is a scene from the book which was omitted in the later version.Most reviewers know the story but it's always interesting to compare different versions of the same film. The later film is a wellknown favorite to most of us but there is a lot to recommend this earlier picture. If you get a chance check it out. It's good but suffers by comparison.".

	schema:headline " Plenty to like in this original version of Dashiell Hammett's story.";
	schema:reviewBody "While the fun toughtalking dialog of the much more famous 1941 version isn't as prevalent here there is much to admire in the forgotten original film which has a much more lighthearted atmosphere slightly comic but not as farcial or offputting as the 1936 disastrous remake Satan Met a Lady. The 1941 version follows closely to this adding more detail to stretch out the running time somewhat but never adding material which is unnecessary to that version's overall plot. The grinning Ricardo Cortez is playboy detective Sam Spade seen in the very beginning saying goodbye to a female conquest presumably his partner's wife then flirts openly with his officious secretary Una Merkel. In comes femme fatal Bebe Daniels a bit younger looking than her replacement Mary Astor but still quite deadly. In fact to escape confusion with the remake the title was changed to Dangerous Female for television but fortunately changed back with its original titles for the DVD release.Then there are the other villains. Dudley Digges takes sleaziness to a new level in the future Sydney Greenstreet role of Casper Gutman. There is nothing to trust in this man In fact the character oozes with creepiness and at times you can't watch him without thinking eeew! to yourself. The same can be said of the film's Joel Cairo here played by Otto Matieson with a different effemininity style than Peter Lorre's. He seems like the type of creep that would shoot or stab someone then comb and restyle their hair so at least they'd be found properly coiffed rather than a corpse with hair out of place. And who better in the early 30's to play the dumb Wilmer than Dwight Frye the flyeating psycho from Dracula? So the detail for character is dead on here if not a bit frightening.As a precode film this outdoes its superior remake perfect as a film yet missing the fun of the innuendos of this version. Once it was revamped in the 1940's it took on a different quality which makes the same story seem quite different. So feel free to watch both versions back to back I suggest skipping Satan Met a Lady other than to see a young Bette Davis in a film she detested because they are different enough even with all of their similarities to be judged on completely different merits.".

There is a sense of realism especially with the interactions between the characters who react in line with their own backstories characters who are simultaneously heroic antiheroic brilliant and ridiculously self absorbed and stupid.Additionally Dark Tide perfectly captured the sense of sheer peace and quiet that consumes you once your head is below the waves in the open ocean. I've been scuba diving all over the world and driven a boat like in this movie. The movie captured the sense of reverence in the water and for the water and took me far away to reefs of my own past.Is it thrilling? Absolutely the action scenes were tense and you felt the weight of the sharks gliding silently just inches away. Is it slower? I was never bored. I enjoyed the characters flaws and all. In the end if anything I wanted more closure and final introspection. But that is the only thing I found lacking. If you remotely like the ocean and treat it as a thriller with a slower burn you will enjoy the movie.6 12 stars.".

What can we say about the cast? It would perhaps be more accurate to describe them as the miscast. Halle Berry looks great. If I went through what she went through in this movie I'd look like something the cat brought in. But even at her most artistically bedraggled Berry looks as if she could just slip into a DG dress and sashay down the catwalk in Paris or Milan. Boat skippers have windwashed complexions. Throughout this movie Berry always looks as if she could have just stepped out of the beauty parlor with her perfect eyeliner her manicured nails and her perfect tan. Her hair gets tousled every now and then but that's about the extent of her dishevelment. If they wanted me to believe that she was the head of a model agency or the editor of a woman's magazine I might have bought it. But a shark expert who spends half her life on a boat? No way Jose. And the rest of the miscast were no more believable. In fairness the cinematography was excellent. The sharks were great too. But they arrived about an hour and twenty minutes too late for which they will not be lightly forgiven by anyone who got suckered into wasting 94 minutes of their life watching this god awful movie.".

So what kind of movie is it then?Dark Tide would have to qualify as an adventure drama or rather an anti adventure drama. It seems that each time director John Stockwell goes seaward with a production the movies get progressively worse. Into the Blue was entertaining but certainly dumb. Blue Crush was dumb and unentertaining. This latest movie is just confused and almost devoid of any reason to watch it.I return to my point about Dark Tide not being a horror film. So why then are the characters deliberately as uninteresting and obnoxious as the cast of any Friday the 13th sequel. Halle Berry is playing the kind of halfassed adolescent role that I'm used to seeing Jennifer Lopez play. Dark Tide gives you an idea of how far she has fallen in the last ten years. She is sleeping with the fishes.The movie lumbers along for a good hour with nothing except the quality of its underwater photography getting you nose to nose with twenty foot sharks to keep you in your seat. The characters exchange lines of sloppy dialogue and do silly things until it's time for distaster to strike in the last half hour. It's fair to say that Stockwell manages to generate some suspense in the climax but he stretches it out too long and the camera work is disorienting.The whole thing doesn't work. It lacks direction intelligence and professional acting. For all I know Dark Tide may just have been an excuse for Stockwell to go diving in South Africa with the sharks and leave the storyline behind.".

The film isn't terrible but it fails to bring much new new to the table.Unlike Deep Blue Sea a good shark movie since Jaws this one ends leaving you almost frustrated.

I am sure she could have found the money another way. While the story isn't exactly predictable you still don't know why they are even in the water in the first place dealing with this stubborn man whom they know nothing about amidst the sharks mating season. Then after an argument breaks out they decide to go to the most shark infested area of all. Stupid! By this point you really don't care that much about its characters since there development is only paperthin.I like the fact that Dark Tide takes place in South Africa instead of the typical US beach locations. Unknown to me it has the largest shark population in the world. There are times during the film where you are not sure what kind of film you are watching  a drama? a thriller? a love story? If it was supposed to be a thriller it had some shocking moments but not scary enough to really break new ground. Nothing in regards to shark attacks we haven't already seen before.

If you fear the idea of swimming with Great White Sharks out in the open ocean of South Africa you will be biting your nails and holding your seat. The night shots are especially scary and all done by situational context not CGI or gross exaggerations. I almost had to Fast Forward through the night scenes because I was so on edge. The character drama and the relationships between the characters was well developed. Acting was excellent. What else would you expect from Holly Berry and Oliver Martinez? I am literally 1 Hour and 28 Minutes into the movie where the final climax is about to start when it hit me that this movie deserves a GOOD review. No way its a 4.3 rating. If you like Ocean thrillers based on realistic plot then check this one out you wont be disappointed.".

This film was incredibly boring for the majority of it's 110 minutes. The parts played by the father and son became ridiculously overbearing and unbelievable. The relationship between Halles' character and her estranged husband also had many holes. The thing that sticks out to me the most is why they thought using a piece of shark footage that was so well known and seen by so many before would be good for this movie. The way it was incorporated into the film was juvenile. The clip is obviously that of the shark leaping clear out of the water with baby seal in mouth. There are very little if any good things to say about this film. My rating of 3.5 is incredibly generous. Overall not very good.".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't know much about the plot before I saw this movie. I figured that it probably wouldn't be to bad and since it has some known faces I expected at least a decent story. I was wrong. The story and the movie are bad and the acting is nothing special. The one redeeming feature is the beautiful scenery of Cape Town and it's surrounding areas. Having been in that part of South Africa it was nice to see them again. The story could have made sense but by the end there are too many plot holes and things that don't make sense. A marine biologist played by Halle Berry who has spent 10 years studying sharks and swimming with them is involved in a shark attack at the start of the movie. Her friend is killed and as a result she has withdrawn from the shark diving world and and takes tourists on boat rides and shows them seals and penguins. She is in financial dire straits and her estranged husband Oliver Martinez proposes a deal for them to take out a rich tourist and his son to swim with sharks. He offers them 100 000 euros in local currency over 1 Million Rand for this. Berry's character reluctantly accepts the offer since she is tricked into believing that someone paying that kind of money will be happy with the promise of being taken out to sea and maybe seeing sharks. She promises she will show them seals and if sharks happen to be present then great. The tourist promises to stay in the shark diving cage until Berry calls him out when it is safe if they do dive with sharks.When they are out in the ocean they go near Seal Island which is world renowned for having an area around the island known as the kill zone where most shark attacks on seals happen. To make matters worse it is the middle of mating season. So yes they are taking tourists out to swim in the kill zone in the middle of shark mating season. At first the rich tourist is told to stay in the shark diving cage but he disregards the instructions and goes out within a few minutes of the dive. This annoys Berry' and she wants to call the whole thing off. Instead she gets into an argument with her husband and changes her mind and decides to take them further out to sea in storm like weather where they can see some really big sharks of up to 20 feet. I am not making this up she literally changes her mind after a shouting argument with her husband and makes a great decision of taking out a small ship into the middle if the ocean in rough conditions with relatively inexperienced and annoying divers. On top of this they had steering problems with the boat but the assistant fixed it so they go on anyway. When they get there she goads the tourist into diving without the cage even though he changed his mind by then. So all of a sudden from being indecisive Berry is almost pushing the man to go into the open water without the protection of a cage. At one point I literally expected them to start riding the sharks rodeo style or jump down their throats which in fact would have been more preferable. As is to be expected the storm tips the boat over and some of the characters are attacked and killed by sharks. There are also minor annoyances in the movie that make it even worse. The tourist lights up a cigarette when he gets on the boat but Berry tells him there is no smoking on her boat. She however doesn't have a problem with him drinking beer even though he is going to go diving with sharks. I guess tipsy or drunk tourists are better for shark diving than those nasty smokers. She also does nothing when her husband light up. She also doesn't take any air cylinders on board because sharks don't like bubbles apparently. They don't much like idiotic plot lines either and in that aspect they are very similar to us movie watchers. The acting Berry tries to carry off a look of indecisiveness and vulnerability but she looks prissy and as if she stepped off of a modeling catwalk. Her husband tries to be caring and helpful but looks dodgy with ulterior motives. Their assistant is supposed to be the comic relief but he is more or less annoying especially when playing a game on his iPad in the game he is the shark getting points for eating surfers. The rich tourist is a just annoying and not likable at all and his son is irrelevant and there to fill the boat and some screen time. I lived in Cape Town and know people who dived with sharks and who are certified divers and they would never go out in middle of shark mating season in bad weather with inexperienced divers and then almost force them out of the cage. They especially wouldn't do that when the Great White Shark is the shark they are after. So it is just nonsense because no one in their right mind would behave the way they do. There is also a scene at the beginning where poachers are shown diving for abalone near the kill zone of seal island in the dark. I mean are they insane why not attach some nice juicy steaks to their dive suits whilst they are at it. Overall this movie attempts to be a character driven movie with subplots and stories. It fails abysmally in this since by the end of the movie you care more about the sharks then the people. Give this a miss you might as well watch the discovery channel for shots of beautiful scenery and sharks.".

It is a very confusing movie. Halle Berry starts the movie as the level headed shark expert but by the end she has completely lost it and is now the moron who costs two people their lives. The deaths in this were completely avoidable and had it been real life Halle would be in prison for manslaughter and reckless endangerment. This movie makes no sense and can't even be classed as B grade. Give this movie a miss. Not even the stunning visuals make this movie worth watching at all.".

During a dive she gets someone killed and refuses to have anything to do with sharks thereafter. Until she needs money and a rich guy offers her 100 000 Euro to take him out and let him swim with great whites.The Good The sharks they are so beautiful. And the filming is just exquisite.The Bad Someone seems to have filmed the first draft of a soso script. The dialogue is cringeworthy. The characters are woefully underdeveloped. The background conflicts are tired and predicable. There are logic fallacies at every turn. This is where a set of good actors could make all the difference. But they don't. With the exception of Luke the characters were was so thoroughly unpleasant I honestly didn't care if they got eaten.The House Blend Sharks are not portrayed just as mindless eating machines. But what are they portrayed as? Inanimate objects really. They swim around in circles not even acknowledging Kate who is touching them tugging their tail fins grabbing hold of their dorsal fins and going for a ride etc.All in all I was disappointed. I wish someone had taken the time to finish the script before turning into a film. A little better dialogue a little tightening up of the plot make the characters a little more believable and sympathetic. It could have made a world of difference.".

Now a word about the criticism of the lovely Halle Berry. These idiots saying she can't act looks to glamorous etc are way off the mark in my opinion. In truth she would still look gorgeous if she had been dragged through a bush but I don't think there was any attempt by her to look overly glam. She had me convinced and looked exactly the way I would expect her too. In the water she was amazing unless that was a stunt double swimming? OK the story had holes but so did Jaws and many other films like this but it was tense and had me on the edge of my seat at times. The only downside was the rather abrupt ending.".

If there was any CGI it wasn't apparent which should be the idea instead the makers have used footage of real white sharks in the wild and integrated these seamlessly with the actors.The Capetown Fish Hoek setting adds realism and whilst the plot is heavily contrived the shark footage more than compensates. It's not in the league of Jaws though imo it does narrowly outperform The Reef which was a pretty decent exponent of the genre itself. Berry and Martinez are merely scenery but director Stockwell's Cougar from Top Gun timing builds suspense nicely despite the clichs.Multiple maulings will keep traditional shark audiences engaged whilst the discerning viewer might be sustained by a more ethical depiction of White sharks. Humans are the antagonists here the men in grey suits simply behaving as any reluctant host would tolerate such an irritating cast of prima donnas. Sharks  6 humans  0.".

Alright now that's out of the way lets focus on what's so terribly wrong with this movie.To be frank I don't really know where to begin. I don't even necessarily think this movie had a bad story in it but it's more the way it's getting handled and executed all that makes this such a poor film to watch.You would think that a movie involving sharks would at least be something tense. But no let me tell you that this movie is an absolutely boring one. It's slow moving though it strangely enough still sees itself as a tense actionthriller. Literly every scene in this movie is at least 10 seconds too long as if the director was afraid to yell out 'cut!'. It not only makes the movie unnecessarily slow but also stretched out overlong and just plain boring. Another thing that heavily annoyed me about this movie were its characters. They are far from likable enough and their motivations are just plain weird and even constantly keep changing throughout this movie which makes it all far from a credible one.Of course the movie does still feature some shark action in but I actually remember very little about them even though I just finished watching this movie a couple of minutes ago. The shark scene's are mostly being very dark and I had no idea what was happening at times because. But it's also because this movie made me zone out a lot because it was being such an uninteresting that was hard to feel involved with in any way or form.The movie also constantly uses the same type of music throughout its entire running time. Also during its action sequences which definitely sounded completely out of place and made all of its action and tense moments work out all the more ineffective.This movie is mostly being an excuse for Halle Berry to show off her body again but really is that all you can do now days in movies Miss Berry?

	schema:reviewBody "Shark Whisperer Kate Halle Berry needs to go back into the water to pay bills. She lost a crewman years ago and blames herself. She takes on Brady Ralph Brown a millionaire who wants to swim with the great whites but outside the cage. This can't be good. This is very disappointing. The story line is simple but where it all goes bad is in the ending and in many dark underwater scenes near the end where all you can see are flashlight beams the water turning red and you hear cries for help but you cannot see exactly what is happening and to whom. Not that we need to see any gore but we may as well be watching a black screen and hearing cries for help. Not good. The ending screamed that we needed some kind of closure. Didn't get it. Much of the acting and dialogues felt contrived forced and pointless. We should have felt some compassion for Kate and we didn't. We didn't care. The first three quarters of the movie are okay due mostly to the photography which is outstanding both above and below the water. The editing also was very good and seamless like you were eavesdropping on the people on the boat. Because of the music and ocean sounds hearing what was being said by the characters was difficult at times. The sightings of sharks alongside the boat are simply scary real and fantastic. And yes the movie JAWS did come to mind. Can't be helped. In most movies about animals fish or birds we learn something most of us didn't know about them. Here we learned almost nothing we didn't already know. Some dialogue tidbits about sharks would have gone a long way to a better appreciation of them and the socalled Shark Whisperers who risk their lives trying to understand them. But to be honest the closest to a shark I would want to be is right here on film. Understanding them is not something I care about. Confusing scenes Three men in diving suits park their pickup and go into the water. They are looking for something but I couldn't hear what it was. You see one of the submerged men find something and scoops it up. You can hear someone saying to hurry up. Next scene is a policeman calling in to his office that he sees the truck and will look around. That's all that was seen. Nothing more was made of this in the story. Seems like someone forgot to edit something out or maybe it was part of another movie. Who knows? Hey we suffer in silence. 210 Memo to Ms. Berry Go back to the Bond movies. Stay out of the water. Violence Yes. Sex No. Nudity No. Language Only a few Swords were heard.".

It's admittedly cool to see people swimming so close to such massive predators but the movie itself is as rote and conventional as can be.

	schema:reviewBody "Great and realistic shots of sharks but the movie is amiss because it fails to create the suspense it should have. I don't think the script was strong enough or was it the direction that failed to capture the thrill it should have hard to pick. The cast was certainly good enough and the shooting of the sharks was so good I doubt anyone can complain about that. We can see how fake the famous 'Jaws' sharks were when we see this movie however the suspense of the Spielberg flick was unmistakable whereas there is virtually no suspense here. The musical score of Jaws played a big part in the suspense building while the score of this movies just does not work for me and I mean not one bit.I was impressed with the camera work underwater it is as close to documentary movies on the subject of swimming with great white sharks as I've seen. However it is not a documentary and as a thriller action movie it deserves the poor all around ratings I've noted at the various sources I usually check. To make my point There is a scene almost midway perhaps a little earlier when a trio of young guys go diving at night and appear to be killed one by one by what we can only presume are sharks that scene is completely unrelated to the rest of the movie it comes out of nowhere and leads to the same place. We never see the sharks. This was amateurish stuff and is a clue to what the rest of the movie had in store. I was disappointed that the movie wasted talent like Halle Bery Olivier Martinez and Ralph Brown they deserved better and I'll do my best to forget they were in this movie.".

Lowkey writing unobtrusive and clearly inexpensive camera work with little camera movement seemingly little use of additional lighting long takes sparing use of close ups  all contribute to the disarmingly intimate experience of the family. This film reminded me of the work of Ozu Yasujiro. All the characters are fresh and unpredictable and there are many moments of humour and pathos with some chickens in the yard playing an important role.

It was during WWII times were tough everyone wanted to survive. Plus better strange them than familiar us.A myriad excuses boiled down to one act of violence after which the town went back to postwar normalcy. People were born as usual grew food all working week went to church on Sundays died. The cycle of life seemed unbroken save for that nuisance from as the movie's events take place around the year 2000 over 50 years ago. And no good can come from pondering about it.The film's two protagonists learn about it the hard way. They are two brothers one of whom has just come back after living for 20 years in the USA. Surprisingly his mentality remained unchanged there. Contrary to that his younger brother who stayed in their backwater little town had undergone a curious transformation he started asking questions about mysterious stone tablets lying in the mud here and there.To say that the acting is solid is an understatement. While perhaps not topnotch effort from all of the cast overall it's nearly as good as it gets. You can expect stellar performances from a handful of elderly actors playing tertiary characters as well as from Ireneusz Czop one of the two main characters. The writing is fine conversations seem natural and there are a few very powerful monologues.So if Poklosie is such a wellacted and written movie with good cinematography music and editing  if there is nothing wrong with it why not more than 710 from me? My only real problem with it is that when it comes to symbolism the director hammed it up. I mean the burning building the dark forest the good priest's heart attack at that particular moment the rain the way a person dies in the movie  come on. Way too dramatic I say. Fear not though as most of my uneasiness comes from the fact that I seriously can't stand overly symbolic images. If you're not particular about them think moderated Independence Day  forget what I said. Just find and watch this film I highly recommend it.Two more things. First the movie's title means The Reaping as in Harvest but also Consequences. My suggestion for the English title would be What You Sow.Second Poklosie is based on true events. Not and I mean it NOT like some cheap horror story. Something very similar to what is unveiled in this film really happened in at least one place in Poland during World War II. Hard to imagine hard to stomach. Hard to remember.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is said that history cannot be buried under the ground. It always comes out of its own accord in the future to talk about the past. This is something which viewers witness in Aftermath which has been set as a fast paced thriller. The story is told through the turbulent lives of two brothers Franek and Jozek who experience how their peaceful life in a small polish village is completely transformed once they come across some horrible secrets involving murders of their Jewish neighbors during second world war. Pasikowski's film succeeds from the beginning as it fights against a lot of clichs. Firstly it is absolutely harsh against the belief that let the secrets remained buried as it would be in the interest of everybody if their currently status quo is maintained and not disturbed in future. This is not something which Kalina brothers are willing to accept readily as it was not on their minds to let the secrets be buried. They were fully aware of consequences they would have to face if they went ahead with their scheme of unearthing secrets. In this manner Kalina brothersFranek and Jozef make it explicitly clear that truth must come out regardless of the anguish and pain it might cause to anybody who is not able to digest it. Although the villagers are not shown in a negative light but director Pasikowski is upright when he shows that there is a lot of resentment in the minds of local people about its inhabitants who have left for USA. The role of church as depicted in this film is rather ambiguous as the local priest chose to remain neutral at a time when a lot could have been done by him to assuage sufferings. The religious angle gets prominence when the younger brother sacrifices himself in the same manner as Jesus Christ to atone for sins committed by his father. It is rather unfortunate that upon its release in Poland Aftermath was embroiled into unnecessary controversy. One fail to understand what led some Polish people to accuse this film of being an anti Polish propaganda. Lastly as freedom of expression is needed to understand the greatness of all works of art it is hoped that the ban on Aftermath in some Polish cinemas would soon be lifted.".

Deeply tragic terribly honest unbearably truthful impossibly merciless. he very topic of Holocaust has been closely watched studied and discussed but here we do not have the scale of Spielberg's Schindler's List or bare wound of Polanski's Pianist. Here we see a minor case nevertheless not a bit less painful or decent. The story of two Kalina brothers in a small Polish village which is shown so vividly and so exact seems to be a bit slow at first but then the tempo of the film gets faster the events get more and more tragic and people become more and more horrible. This is a fictitious village but the story itself is of Jedwabne origin with local population taking part in killing all local Jews just to be commended by Nazis. The very fact that the movie was prohibited in some Polish Gminy regions and harshly attacked by nationalists shows how very true it is and how precisely it hit the tee. Ireneusz Czop as Franciszek Kalina Maciej Stuhr as Jzef Kalina brother of Franciszek Jerzy Radziwiowicz as the rector Zuzana Fialov as Justyna granddaughter of Sudecki Andrzej Mastalerz as Janusz Pawlak Zbigniew Zamachowski as police Sgt. Wodzimierz Nowak Danuta Szaflarska as the elderly herbalistall these actors did a marvelous and very deep performance and the very core of the problem is shown extremely well. Thye final discovery is so tragic for Kalina Brothers so bad so terrible to know that one of them cannot bear the truth anymore and the other does what he really has to. The final scene with Jewsish relatives of murdered locals is deeply sad touching and really great. I highly recommend this excellent film and commend it 10 out of 10. This is a superb work of Wladyslaw Pasikowski  he did his real best.".

My uncle died in Auschwitz for being family of important man before 1939. He was 16 years old boy. Pole not Jew. Whole my family was destined to die in Auschwitz but managed to avoid it except my young uncle... Back to movie. My family was in Warsaw was in underground and... was helping Jews in Ghetto and I also have Jew family and proud of it. It was very hard to believe that Jedwabne and similar facts happened especially for my grand dad but... Even thought he was victim of denunciation he was also victim of small peasant communities like Jedwabne. He had to pay to not be arrested by Gestapo and he had to pay with family precious relics and everything he had. Just because peasants knew who he was. And he had to eat. Probably we will never know how many people died because of mentality of people like in Poklosie... Creators of Poklosie including actors are enemy of the state but many people still remember who made money for deaths. Yes I know it's short and not important comment but if you know how less popular version of polish history looked like  watch the movie. No it was not always like this  this is why most Israelis has polish roots but we should remember of German French Dutch French Russian and other people who helped Nazis just for money.No comment. you just have to see this movie no matter what you think.

	schema:reviewBody "I have become increasingly interested in films and books that address the topic of Polish antiSemitism. Initially I approached the topic defensively. How I wondered did France and Italy get so conveniently off the hook in the post war years when the capitulation and collaboration with the Nazis that occurred in those countries is indisputable? Poland's government was the only one that did not capitulate to the Nazis during World War II and that is part of the reason Warsaw was reduced to rubble. Nazi punishment for Poles during the war was exceptionally harsh whole families were put to death for harboring Jews.Aftermath directed by Wladyslaw Pasikowski is another example of a new generation of Polish writers and artists coming to terms with a dark past. The film begins with the return of a man to his hometown after 20 years of living in Chicago. Something is clearly amiss. His brother has inexplicably begun unearthing Jewish gravestones that were used as paving blocks after the war. The neighbors are unaccountably hostile. The buried secrets concern the wartime fate of the local Jews who contrary to official history were not deported by the Nazi occupiers but massacred in a single day by their Gentile neighbors. Released in Poland in 2012 Aftermath has reignited the controversy that surrounded the publication in 2000 of the book Neighbors by the historian Jan T. Gross a searing account of the coveredup slaughter in Jedwabne a once halfJewish village in northeastern Poland where hundreds of Jews including children were murdered in a savage pogrom in 1941.In Afternmath Poles accustomed to seeing themselves as victims during World War II are confronted with an incident in which their countrymen had been victimizers. Nationalists are incensed. Others have found this revelation evidence of a nation coming to terms with its disturbing past. Pasikowski saw the subject as material for a movie. The film isn't an adaptation of the book which is documented and factual but the film did grow out of it since it was the source of my knowledge and shame he has said. Aftermath which is set around 2001 at the time of the Jedwabne debate to which the film never explicitly refers in the same rural region of northeast Poland and draws not only on the book Neighbors but also the 1996 documentary Shtetl made by Marian Marzynski. Obsessed with the idea of rescuing the remnants of Jewish life Pasikowski's protagonist Jozef Kalina Maciej Stuhr is subjected to intense hostility. Jozef is ostracized by his neighbors. His wife unable to withstand the pressure has left for Chicago. His older brother Franciszek Ireneusz Czop who departed Poland on the eve of the 1981 declaration of martial law returns to investigate and finds himself unwillingly drawn into his brother's mission excavating the past with increasingly violent and ultimately devastating results. As a naive outsider learning about World War II from people who survived it and their children I was obsessed during the seven months in 2000 that I lived in Poland with the enormity of Poland's loss during World War II. I visited cemetery after cemetery. In Biala Podlaska the headstones in the Jewish cemetery had all been taken for building material the cemetery itself was there a large green lawn that somebody kept mowed. In Wyszkow the stones had been recovered and built into a monument that reminded me of the Vietnam Memorial in Washington only without visitors. In Nowe Miasto Lubawskie where I lived we found a stash of Jewish headstones in storage in the sanitation services yard set aside after they had been unearthed during road construction. I shocked at how Jewish tombstones had been treated after the war but no more or less shocked after asking a priest to help me find my grandfather's grave in the Catholic cemetery He is buried there for sure but in those days people did not buy these big gravestones like today. A wooden cross. It lasted maybe ten twenty years and that's it. Then as years passed new graves were dug on top of the old.Watching Aftermath with my knowledge and experience of Poland I wondered what it would be like to see this film without understanding that 6 million Poles were murdered during the war half of them Jews and half of them ethnic Poles without understanding that prewar antiSemitism was probably less threatening in Poland than in any other European country without knowing that there are more Poles 6394 named on Yad Vashem than any other nationality and that one of Yad Vashem's principal duties is to convey the gratitude of the State of Israel and the Jewish people to nonJews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust. This is the danger of learning history through movies which must simultaneously serve as entertainment.".

They are both experiencing some kind of aftermath  Franek fled Poland years before and is teased for coming back home while Jozek's wife and kids have inexplicably left him and he's the most hated man in town. When Franek finds out Jozek Maciej Stuhr has inexplicably ripped up a thoroughfare road surface nearby he must unravel the mystery  leading to a discovery that breaks open all they know about their family and the town around them.The film has a strong storyline related to World War II and the slaughter of Polish Jews which has been controversial in its home country.This unique gritty thriller is bound to truelife events and so emotive that it's easy to see why the reaction might have been so strong from a country where religion still plays such a huge part in all aspects of life.Performances are tight measured and wellrounded. Actors breathe life into the script in every corner with even cameo players adding to a dark and lustrous community of characters within the film's grim premise  The human drive for survival in exceptional circumstances as violent greedy and barbaric fuels performances with meaty and violent lines in even the oldest actors here.Wladyslaw Pasikowski the director stuns from the first minute narrating with simple and blunt motif from the off We see Franek Ireneusz Czop arriving in Warsaw at the start of the film his eye twitches just once as he irritatedly hands over his passport. It's lean storytelling that keeps you guessing to a sad and horrifying end.Exquisitely shot and colored with images of Polish landscape like paintings that wash you in the atmosphere of 80's Eastern Europe  maybe Franek feels nothing has changed since he left thirty years ago  Hasn't changed a bit. he says entering Jozek's house. It's no surprise that Polanski's cinematographer on The Pianist Pawel Edelman is at work as the DoP here.Something about this movie reminded me of Almodovar's The Skin I Live in or Arcel's Dragon Tattoo or maybe Music Box. The way the characters build and the tension in silence and also the absolutely native way the tradition political situation and historical culture of Poland is presented. The back story is crafted brilliantly  Poland becomes a whole character in itself with a personality mood and motivation  and not always in a good way. Poland has its dark underbelly.This is where the genius of this script lies. To someone who knows nothing of Poland's rich interior tapestry and relationships with the outside world this film enlightens and interests succinctly without a history lesson with an engrossing soundtrack from Jan Duszynski reminiscent of another Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner with his work on Three Colors.In fact the criticism lies only in the way the subtitles have been produced. They are one beat behind all the time  I would like to see the subtitle when the character speaks not half a second after and there are some spelling mistakes in them herehear dromfrom youryou're maybemebbe for example and odd words like  vacationers and a 100 years used in a sort of nonnative way. Some sentences are not proof read and are missing words your brother didn't back..? This did spoil my enjoyment of the film occasionally.This script is ripe for an American remake but it's pretty likely this Polish original will remain superior. A tense and intelligent haunting of a film absolutely recommended  an outstanding European seatsticker.".

	schema:headline " Truly depressing. Twisted bunch of half truths and lies presented as historical events.";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a very primitive piece of propaganda. Presents a very one   dimensional and biased picture of Jewish  Polish relationship which  in reality was extremely complex. My review is NOT an attempt to say  that there are no dark pages in Polish history in regards to this  matter. I would just like to state that it presents a most extreme  exaggeration of known facts presented by Jewish side. This version  began to fall apart the moment the official investigation into the  matter was launched. Jewish rabies started to protest and oppose the  exhumations the very moment German shells were dug out from the barn  realise  owning a firearm by a Polish peasant at that time equals  death on the spot.  The movie presents Polish antisemitism as purely fueled by ignorance  and intolerance while totally omitting how significant percent of  Jewish minority in Poland were actively involved in dismantling an  independent Polish state and trying to submit it to the power of an  aggressive and expansionist neighbor Soviet Union. Simply look into  Jewish role in communist movement and particularly NKWD responsible  for death torture and sending to Siberia estimated 250 thousands of  Polish patriots who kept fighting against Soviet domination. This piece  of history is not even mentioned in our own schools until this day.  The attempts by Jewish Zionist movement to use straight lies and half  truths to hurt Polish national interest date back to beginning of the  XX century and continue until today in a similar fashion. Back then  they presented Poland as unworthy of independence because they're  bigot and intolerant. These arguments were then backed in US political  circles by photos of bestial massacres of Jewish people committed in  Russia in late XIX century by Tatars.  It's very sad that this movie in reality addressed to the Western  World Americans Britons and Germans in particular to plant an idea  that this really happened the way it's pictured was funded by Polish  government money.  I repeat I'm not writing this to pretend that Polish nation has  nothing to be ashamed of. There's plenty. But attempts to clean our  closets by people who have their own full of skeletons using lies and  cheap propaganda are more hypocrisy than I and many of us can take.  Let's just ponder for a moment  where did all the Polish Jews come  from??? Maybe from all of the Europe where they were banned and chased  away from by acts of antisemitism dating back to middle ages and  continuing into modern era. The very same countries that are now trying  to sound morally superior giving us lessons in tolerance. Disgusting.  Edit And this is precisely why I call this movie a piece of  propaganda. Known facts state that a relatively small group of Polish  inhabitants of Jedwabne around 40 took took part in bestial massacre  of Jewish people around 340. There are strong indications that this  act was inspired overseen by Germans German troops and police present  in the village on that day. It was undeniably fueled by ulterior  motives but revenge for recent Jewish collaboration with Soviets in  this area was very likely a major factor of course it doesn't excuse  this bestiality in any way but it does put it in some perspective. Man  who tried to save the memory about these events by collecting  tombstones is one of the most respected people and became a mere of a  nearby town. What film says it that most Poles in Jedwabne slaughtered  all Jews out of sheer organic badness jealousy and greed. The man who  poked into these matters got crucified on the barn door in 21st  century!. The acting is wooden dialogues are unnatural. There is no  life in this piece of cinema it feels like reading 8 years' old  homework. Means of expression are like taken from Leni Riefenstahl's  movies playing football with a head? crucifixion on barn door with  police watching and doing nothing? WTF?. The film was made to plant an  idea that of course this is dramatized but basically that's how it was  and that is what Poles are. People like BigScreenDom switch their  thinking off and yell antisemitism without even bothering to check if  the facts I mentioned are historically accurate. This is exactly how  propaganda works.".

The movie presents Polish antisemitism as purely fueled by ignorance  and intolerance while totally omitting how significant percent of  Jewish minority in Poland were actively involved in dismantling an  independent Polish state and trying to submit it to the power of an  aggressive and expansionist neighbor Soviet Union. Simply look into  Jewish role in communist movement and particularly NKWD responsible  for death torture and sending to Siberia estimated 250 thousands of  Polish patriots who kept fighting against Soviet domination. This piece  of history is not even mentioned in our own schools until this day.  The attempts by Jewish Zionist movement to use straight lies and half  truths to hurt Polish national interest date back to beginning of the  XX century and continue until today in a similar fashion. Back then  they presented Poland as unworthy of independence because they're  bigot and intolerant. These arguments were then backed in US political  circles by photos of bestial massacres of Jewish people committed in  Russia in late XIX century by Tatars.  It's very sad that this movie in reality addressed to the Western  World Americans Britons and Germans in particular to plant an idea  that this really happened the way it's pictured was funded by Polish  government money.  I repeat I'm not writing this to pretend that Polish nation has  nothing to be ashamed of. There's plenty. But attempts to clean our  closets by people who have their own full of skeletons using lies and  cheap propaganda are more hypocrisy than I and many of us can take.  Let's just ponder for a moment  where did all the Polish Jews come  from??? Maybe from all of the Europe where they were banned and chased  away from by acts of antisemitism dating back to middle ages and  continuing into modern era. The very same countries that are now trying  to sound morally superior giving us lessons in tolerance. Disgusting.  Edit And this is precisely why I call this movie a piece of  propaganda. Known facts state that a relatively small group of Polish  inhabitants of Jedwabne around 40 took took part in bestial massacre  of Jewish people around 340. There are strong indications that this  act was inspired overseen by Germans German troops and police present  in the village on that day. It was undeniably fueled by ulterior  motives but revenge for recent Jewish collaboration with Soviets in  this area was very likely a major factor of course it doesn't excuse  this bestiality in any way but it does put it in some perspective. Man  who tried to save the memory about these events by collecting  tombstones is one of the most respected people and became a mere of a  nearby town. What film says it that most Poles in Jedwabne slaughtered  all Jews out of sheer organic badness jealousy and greed. The man who  poked into these matters got crucified on the barn door in 21st  century!. The acting is wooden dialogues are unnatural. There is no  life in this piece of cinema it feels like reading 8 years' old  homework. Means of expression are like taken from Leni Riefenstahl's  movies playing football with a head? crucifixion on barn door with  police watching and doing nothing? WTF?. The film was made to plant an  idea that of course this is dramatized but basically that's how it was  and that is what Poles are. People like BigScreenDom switch their  thinking off and yell antisemitism without even bothering to check if  the facts I mentioned are historically accurate. This is exactly how  propaganda works.";

	schema:headline " High quality film showing a dark side of Poland during WWII towards its Jews";
	schema:reviewBody "Besides West Germany under Konrad Adenauer and later governments no other European country did any serious effort to admit their role in Jewish deportation and final annihilation during the Nazi era of WWII. East Germany persistently denied having had anything to do with it and Austria still considers itself as having being occupied by the Nazis instead of the truth which is having joyful joined Hitler's Germany as seen in old news reels with hundreds of thousands enthusiastic people in the street parades welcoming the Germans troops at the Anschluss.Poland as France Switzerland and other countries preferred to ignore any kind of collaboration or sympathy for the Nazi regime.Switzerland closed his frontiers to countless Jews which was tantamount to sent them back to a clear death.The Vatican accepted a very small number of Jews in the Vatican State as alibi but did not intervene at Hitler as it should morally have done. Pope Pius XII is supposed to have believed that the Jews historically deserved in a certain way that punishment but of course the Vatican denies it.France had to wait very long time until President Chirac was the first who had the courage to recognize the French active collaboration in the deportation of French Jews including hundreds of very small children! to the German death camps. He apologized in the name of the French nation. A noble gesture!His predecessor President Mitterand who had a dubious role during the occupation although supposedly having been a socialist had before Chirac strongly denied any guilt of his country and had found no reason to apologize. He even protected during his presidency some old friends who were directly responsible for having organized those deportations people who had made even more efforts to carry out their sinister task than what the Nazis requested from them!At the time of the hopeless desperate and heroic revolt at the Jewish Getto of Warsaw the Polish underground partisans refused to supply the Jewish fighters with weapons or help them in any way... unless they paid for it which was not possible since within the Getto they were starving to death!If the Germans undertook to get rid of the Polish Jews well it was not such a bad idea after all. In any case not a Polish problem at all!. The less Jews in Poland the better was the general feeling in Poland during the Nazi occupation with some noble exceptions of very courageous Poles who risked their own life to hide Jews. Besides as shown in the film it allowed many Poles to get hold of the houses land properties and other possessions of all the disappeared Jews something which of course also took place in other European countries.This film made by a non Jewish! very courageous film maker created unsurprisingly a great turmoil in Poland. Wladyslaw Pasikowski was even accused to be a a polish hater. However the facts it tells are entirely true although the names for obvious reasons were changed and some details added or modified for cinematographic reasons.This film together with Schindler's List is a MILLESTONE in the films describing WWII and the Holocaust. No doubt it is very difficult to accept for Polish citizens. They will willingly see the film about the Katyn massacre organized by Stalin a film in which Wladyslaw Pasikowski collaborated as well since it concerned Polish victims. However most of them do not want to know anything about the sad role that Poland played towards their Jews during the German occupation and long before with Numerus Clausus for Jews in educational institutes restriction where Jews were allowed to live countless Pogroms etc..Whoever wants to have a comprehensive view of the Nazi era in Europe SHOULD see this film.The arguments others brought here against this film are in my opinion fallacious. No film is perfect and no historical film is 100 identical to the facts it tells. However even if some events might be slightly changed the true point of the film is to reveal the attitude of most Poles during the Nazi occupation towards their Jewish fellow citizens. Unfortunately although the number of Jews presently living in Poland can easily be neglected strangely enough Antisemitism is still very strong in present day Poland. Antisemitism without Jews!!!! An interesting example is for instance Lech Walesa. He is no doubt a hero from the Polish point of view but that does not change his negative feelings towards Jews. Antisemitism and his present forms of Antiisraelism Antizionism and so on are still a sad reality with different degrees of violence in most countries in the world in the 21th century.Antisemitism in Poland is a many hundred years phenomenon with a special additional fact non present in other European countries in which Pogroms against Jews also took place the strong Polish catholicism and the old catholic accusation Jews killed Jesus taken seriously by the illiterate people ignoring that actually the Romans crucified Jesus and that Jesus was himself a Jew!.How many people know for instance that at his time Chopin refused to play in a concert hall... if he learned that Jews were among the public? That does not diminish at all of course the great musical value of Chopin's music but just shows that he also was a true Pole from this dark point of view as well. To sum up this is an astounding film and well worth to see!!! Whoever sees it without being in advance biased against it will not forget it!".

But once you get to know what really happened and then watch the movie you're only left with bewilderment or disgust.While in the movie the whole village and all of its ancestors have dirt on their hands and desperately try to shut down the inconvenient truth from coming out in reality the excavations in Jedwabne were stopped by the Jews. As more and more proof came out clearly proving that Germans orchestrated that bestial crime interest in continuing the search was substituted with demands to stop it basing it on not wanting to further profanate the dead bodies. And it came from those same Jewish organizations that pushed hard for excavating. The truth turned out to be less spicy than people thought  if we can even sum up like that such a tragedy.The film made quite a storm in Poland and for good reason. AntiPolish movies that show us in the worst possible light are getting financed easily from public money while the ones that try to be as faithful to the real history and patriotic movies in general are regularly denied funding. For Polish people aided by our own government to produce a movie that blatantly lies about history to put us in the worst possible light while claiming to do the opposite supposedly coming to terms with dark past sounds like a cruel joke but that's our reality and people grow more conscious and angered with it every year.If you want to watch it as a nonfactual movie for its story and are not interested in historical realism it's probably worth it it's decent. Still a movie that not only addressed history but a highly sensitive and painful subject must be judged by how close it sticks to what we really know about the topic. After all people treat movies that refer to history as a source of information about the world that we live in. So when such drastic deviation is being made even if it would be an Oscarworthy material which it's far from its core is still rotten and that has to reflect on rating. As a fictional movie 6.510. With historical lesson included 210.".

	schema:reviewBody "Aftermath 2012 release from Poland 2014 DVD release in the US 107 min. brings the fictional story of the aftermath of WWII in a rural village in Poland. As the movie opens we see Francis Kalina landing at Warsaw's airport. We later learn that he basically leftfled Poland for the US when General Jaruzelski declared martial law in 1981 and that this is his first time back in 20 years thus setting the movie in the early '00s. Francis comes to visit his younger brother Jozef who runs a small farm. It's not long before we notice that the villagers seem to despise Jozef. We then learn that Jozef has taken a personal interest in restoring tomb stones of local Jews who were murdered by the Germans in WWII and Jozef is recreating a cemetery on his farm one by one with the tomb stones he recovers. Meanwhile in a parallel story things seem askew with the property title of Jozef's farm. To tell you more about this plotheavy movie would spoil your viewing experience you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments I saw this movie recently at a film festival more on that later. I had never heard of the movie and didn't know anything about it or the plot going in. I was surprised how long it took for the true story lines to emerge. When Jozef the younger brother is assaulted in a caf a good 3040 min. into the movie for no apparent reason I made the mental note... why?. The story line involving the property titles is developed even later about an hour into the movie. Frankly by then I was about to give up on the movie. I decided to hang in there and yes the last 3040 min. redeem the movie to a degree. Perhaps one of the reasons that I had trouble connecting is that I was not all that impressed with the acting performances I mean you truly watch them act when in a film you shouldn't feel as if you are watching acting you know what I mean? All that aside the historic background and ulterior intentions of the movie can never be in doubt and just from that angle this is something people should watch.I recently saw Aftermath at the 2015 Jewish  Israeli Film Festival here in Cincinnati. The screening was sold out but more importantly the organizers have assembled a topnotch quality lineup of movies such as The Green Prince Dancing in Jaffa and The Third Half just to name those. As a movie buff and a support of the Israeli cause I absolutely love this festival. As to Aftermath the movie is wellintended but takes forever to establish so I'm giving it a mixed 3.5 stars not bad but not great either.".

The result can be devastating if you've already seen the original Sadko 1952.There are good and bad comments about this film thanks to the redubbed version. I'm sure everyone that has seen the original version sadko will give it at least an 8 out of 10.Someone made a comment that the film is goofy because Sinbad wasn't wet when he visited the great kingdom at the bottom of the sea and how did he manage to hold his breath that long. Well... the film is a fairy tale not a documentary or reality show...nothing is real and it would have looked goofy if they were wet. As a matter of fact the underwater scenes are a feast for the eyes and a big step in special effects during its time 1952. This film should be treated with more respect. I'm sure if these critics see the originalsadko 1952 their views will be totally different. And I think ''the magic voyage of sinbad'' should not be credited with ''SADKO''. Little is known about sadko while magic voyage of sinbad was well advertised 10 years later.

I applaud the restorers for doing this timely work and the translators for the subtitles!. I pray that they endeavor with more restorations of many Russian classics that we American's have not had opportunity to view. I have not watched the other version with the English language dubbing The Magic Voyage of Sinbad but I can gather from another user's comments that it had to have been pretty bad. I prefer original language in such films anyway and don't mind reading the movie.Considering the film was done in 1953 without our cgi stuff and other advanced technology of today the visuals are absolute gems well done. I had a flash forward of a Finding Nemo type fish in one of the scenes which was about the only part that was more of a hokey cheaply done prop filler which could and perhaps should have been edited out. However due to the nature of that fishy prop it was rather unique and funny and added more to the fantasy theme of the movie.Even though the acting was somewhat stiffly hokey by mollywood viewers of the Americas Russians have a certain flair akin only to their culture. It was refreshing to listen to the Russian men's deep voices that we usually associate with ruffians in many movies. And the Russian dancing! Loved it! So to comments about the acting? Well methinks ya need to know a few Russians and their flair and to turn back the clock in remembering when this movie was made ... without this acting this movie would have been the Pitts ... it gave the film that certain further flair of saying This is a fantasy flick so don't take anything too seriously. Excellent family film as long as the kids can read!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an update to my comment which I wrote on April 28 2005 This film the original Russian film has been completely restored by Mosfilm and is available on DVD in NorthAmerica from the Ruscico label in most major outlets. The film restoration is incredible the colours are vibrant and not a single frame is missing from the original elements. Furthermore the RimskyKorsakoff music has been rerecorded in stereo and the sound is in 5.1 Dolby with lots of atmospheric surround effects. It comes with many extras including two interviews with Stolyarov's son who is not too kind to Francis Ford Coppola. I knew there was a masterpiece under all that grime and that bad sound. It just needed a lot of work. It's just too bad the release of the original did not receive one fifth the publicity of the Coppola atrocity The Magic Voyage of Sinbad. By the way the illustration on the IMDb Sadko page is not of this Russian film but of the opera version of the same name.This is my original comment of a year ago I first saw 'Sadko' on television in Frenchspeaking Quebec barely four years after it had been honoured at the Venice Film Festival. I was six years old at the time and the film was in French and in black and white. In those days of the Cold War the French had no compunction about distributing Russian films and translating them into French and Canadian television had no compunction about showing this one to the very impressionable children it was meant to be shown to. This film was Russia's attempt to create a children's colour classic that would be on a par with 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'The Thief of Bagdad'. I think they succeeded admirably even though there is no denying its profound 'russianness'. 'Sadko' is based on a Russian fairytale that also inspired the opera of the same name by RimskyKorsakoff and it incorporates the opera's ballets and melodies in its action. The acting is exemplary of the Romantic operatic tradition somewhat tempered by the more realistic method acting of Stanislavsky. The hero is the very prototype of the rugged yet sensitive and extremelyhandsome peasantpoet who wants to bring happiness to the people of his city despite the active opposition greed and selfishness of the fat rich merchant capitalists who run the city of Novgorod. To achieve this he goes searching for the legendary 'bird of happiness' but only finds after many adventures an Indian 'bird of forgetfulness' religion being the opium of the people as Marx would have commented. He eventually comes to the same conclusion Dorothy comes to 'There's no place like home'. The only way Americans have ever seen this film for the most part is through the emasculated version called 'The Magic Voyage of Sinbad' which for purely exploitative reasons turned this art film intended as a goodwill gesture for the world's children into a commercial adventure film by robbing it of its context Sinbad was substituted for Sadko and Arabia for Russia of its moral all political speeches were mollified of its characters the love story was truncated of its poetry through a very bad translation and of most of its glorious establishing shots. The original runs for 85 minutes and the Russian songs music and acting make even the 'octopus's garden' scene palatable for adults. I thought I would have to spend a lifetime retracing this film in order to relive a very precious childhood memory. It took me months just to find out what the film's Russian title was and years to get my hands on two very bad VHS copies of 'The Magic Voyage of Sinbad' which have been bootlegged from television and which are offered by quite a few American distributors of offbeat cinema. I would recommend to anybody who is seriously interested in getting to know this film to do what I did. I made inquiries in the Russian gift shops of my city Toronto and eventually found a Mosfilmapproved PALtoVHS transfer of the original in Russian only without subtitles. This is no great loss in itself as the images and the music speak for themselves and the Russian speeches have a charm all their own. The strangeness of watching a Russian film without subtitles is also very liable to recreate in the viewer the very sense of wonder which children were supposed to experience when they first see this film. Unfortunately even this 'official' video version is a poor transfer although infinitely better than the American bootlegs especially lacking in definition and solid colour and its hifi soundtrack suffers from a continual hiss. It suggests that the original could probably use a major and costly restoration. But it also shows that this film can boast great direction magnificent composition photography and lighting elaborate art direction impressive handling of crowd scenes great costumes evocative special effects the bird of forgetfulness is a particularly powerful and memorable image and a general poetic tone that is its reason for being and the first casualty of its American 'adaptation'. Here's hoping that it makes its way to a decent DVD transfer one of these days and why not even a Criterion edition.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a visually splendid film version of an old Russian legend  which was the basis of an opera by RimskyKorsakov.  The plot has been altered somewhat to enhance its appeal as a film   and   in the English version the names of the characters and even locations have been completely changed giving a most bizarre effect!   The eponymous hero is now  Sinbad  and he is now a citizen of  Kobasan  instead of Novgorod.  Some of the special effects are a little crude   but the art direction is often stunning.  The acting style and even the makeup reflect Russian films of the fifties  and show an affinity to operatic style.  Even the score borrows liberally from RimskyKorsakov. My advice to the viewer of the English version is to turn the sound so low as to be inaudible  and enjoy the visuals !".

He's got two girls in love with him one is a nice village girl with a weird pigeon habit and the other is the Princess of the Sea.... Clearly the thing to do is get out of town quick so Sadko trades 3 goldfish for 3 boats they were magic goldfish and sets sail to find the Bird of Happiness. Along with a small army are Uncle Klepto Big John and Timmy the brash young mascot of the group  these are not their actual names but they might as well be. The heroes are so clich they're almost iconic.Sadko and Co. spend the rest of the movie traveling to exotic places and getting into trouble with the locals. They battle Vikings and play chess with the King of India. They bet a laughing horse for the Bird of Happiness and discover her true nature is not what they thought. They fight and are heroic and on the return trip a storm threatens to sink the ships so Sadko goes to the bottom of the sea to soothe an argument between King Neptune and his wife by entertaining them with his harp. Although the Princess loves Sadko she knows he prefers the pigeon girl. She helps him get home again on a speedy seahorse.This is a very nice looking film. The story is fantastical without being too familiar. There is plenty of Russian flavor to make it semiexotic to American tastes and the Russian folk dancing is amazing. The special fx are charming and obvious like stage tricks. When Sadko lifts a magic fish the light rays emitting from it are actually hundreds of metal wires sticking out of the fish! Most of the exotic locations are drawings but the India sequence is full of elephants and dancing girls and over the top temples. The Bird of Paradise is satisfyingly surreal in a way that just wouldn't happen now with CGI. The final act in Neptune's Kingdom is a campy delight.I rate it 8 out of 10. I'd originally seen the Sinbad version and I had to turn the sound down. It was that bad and obvious the visuals were from a better movie. I'm glad I saw the restored Russian version because the visuals are much clearer and the original soundtrack is pleasant with strong music and the deep serious voices of the men. The story also made a lot more sense. Highly recommend! Would love to see more of this kind of film.".

Besides anything I could write about the plot would hardly matter as the American bastardization of Sadko that I watched appears to bear only a passing resemblance to either the original Russian movie or the classic Russian folktale on which it was based. First off I wonder whose bright idea it was to turn the character named Sadko into Sinbad. Let's see Sadko is a poor Russian musician  Sinbad is an adventurous MiddleEastern sailor. A lot of similarity there huh? Secondly I really have to wonder if the Russian version of the movie included anything about a quest for a bird of happiness. I say this because in the end the bird hardly seems to matter at all. It's almost as if the idea of the bird was added to the American version to give some sort of justification for Sinbad going to sea.Beyond the problems of Americanizing this Russian movie I have problems with the bits of the original Sadko that seep through. As I stated in my recent review of The Sword and the Dragon aka Ilya Muromets I'm not a fan of this style of Russian movie or acting. The Sword and the Dragon seemed to be filled with such broad overacting that it became absurd. I realize that the movie was made over 50 years ago in the Soviet Union. I understand that the movie is filled with messages and other proworker propaganda. And I appreciate the importance of the film as a relic of the communist system. But none of that means I have to actually like the movie. If you change the title of the movie this quote accurately reflects my feelings on The Magic Voyage of Sinbad. And even though I realize that my appreciation of the movie might be improved if I were to have the opportunity to see the original film I doubt the change would be drastic.Like many others I saw The Magic Voyage of Sinbad through Mystery Science Theater 3000. I enjoyed this episode much more than the previously mentioned The Sword and the Dragon episode. Overall some very funny riffs. I'll give episode 505 a 45 on my MST3K rating scale.".

	schema:reviewBody "For the past month or so Russian fantasy films have really captivated me. Sadko certainly did that with me. Sadly the dubbed versionnamed The Magic Voyage of Sinbad is one that should never have happened it is absurdest rather than magical and replaces any thrills or wonder with unintentional humour and dullness. The Russian originalSadko has that sense of fun and magic there is a little too much talk and the acting did seem a little stiff at times. However it looks wonderful the sets and costumes are eyecatching the special effects have a sweep and charm to them and the colour just leaps out at you in a thrilling dazzle. The music is similarly beautiful very like RimskyKorsakov and the Russian Folk Dancing is both energetic and magnetic in how it is performed and choreographed. The story has the fun thrill and wonder you'd hope for in a fantasy film and done in a way to captivate children and adults alike. The characters are like out of a fairytale but not done in a bland way. There is some stiffness in the acting sure but there is also a certain nobility too especially in the titular role that matches the characters very well. In conclusion I liked it very much but I do absolutely agree with those who say the original Russian version is the one to see. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " Sinbad it is not Sadko is the name.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a Russian film that is titled Sadko and was repackaged as a Sinbad film for its release in the United States. Which means a whole lot of people are going to profess their love for it despite the fact the film is not really all that good. The lead in this film is a blond dude who likes to play his harp and give speeches. He also looks nothing like Sinbad the sailor as the only thing the two heroes have in common is their beards. I guess their was no other hero the United States distributor could think of when they were translating this from Russian to English. It is kind of like how they repackaged a few of the Italian hero Maciste as Hercules but those two had way more in common than this guy and Sinbad. As I stated I do not find this film all that good but as with many Russian films from the communist era people are going to claim it is golden and rave about it. It is no better than films made here from this era and at times it is much worse but hey it's Russian it has to be good! To be fair once they finally go sailing the film picks up a bit but to get to that point is torture as one must endure speech after speech from our hero! Seems they spent the entire budget on the India scene too as it is the best looking and done part in the film. After that you get to watch the men 'sail' in front of an obvious screen a storm batter an obvious model ship and a strange puppet show underwater! The story has Sadko returning to his native home where the merchants are apparently not sharing their wealth. So Sadko does this and that to try and get the merchants to finance his trip to find the bird of happiness which they scoff at. He plays his harp at a lake which gets the attention of Neptune's daughter and she tells him she will give him golden fish. He makes a deal with the merchants if he catches said fish they will give him their wares and if he fails they can behead him. After more stuff like this they finally launch they expedition and the movie finally takes off as they battle vikings and then make their way to India all to find the bird of happiness. Sadko even ends up in Neptune's crazy undersea kingdom.This film was featured on the riff show Mystery Science Theater 3000 and it made for a funny episode. Once again though the laughs did not come at a good pace until the trip was finally in full swing. It just takes so long for Sadko to get ready to go anywhere! However once they do get a move on it is a much more enjoyable film and episode. The highlight being the undersea kingdom as it is full of a lot of wacky stuff though that one creepy bird was pretty wacky too. My favorite part though was when the pigeon somehow made it to Sadko while he was underwater and Joel asked How does that happen? So no this film is not really all that good. Perhaps it is better in its native language but I do not think restoring the original Russian version is going to make those speeches any more exciting or make the effects during some of those later scenes any better. Seriously if it is Russian it does not mean the film is automatically good. I think the film they riffed The Magic Sword which was American was a better film than this one was and it had better effects too.".

But even if Stalin saw fit to award the poopy film and to foist it on the Capitalist West as a piece of bloated propaganda the film fails as a useful tool against Capitalism and is simply the perfect cure for insomnia. It's rather funny in fact that the bird of happiness puts people to sleep considering that most of the audience was probably asleep before she even made her brief cameo. If anything she probably caused a few people to stir considering she was the prettiest face in the tired and dreadful film.

He gives guys free drinks and then proceeds to smash their chests in!  Sinbad enjoys spending leisure time playing harp at local coffee shops. Don't miss his encore performance by the lake in one of the goofiest dub songs ever.  Definitely lost in translation.Confused yet?  You will be.  You've also got maniacal laughing horse chess duel jester party those nuts! a bear in Hammer pants plywood surfing and so much more.  By the way were vikings ever enemies of Sinbad?  It's also not good to have sleep inducing magic in your movie because it may tend to affect even the audience!  This film's chock full of schlock including an underwater rave in Neptune's kingdom and a whole lot of wackiness.  Oh and some hokey moral about how money can't bring happiness and that girls really dig guys with golden fish.  I know this is a dubbed movie version but the bad voice acting and hilarious Sinbad solo to Neptune's daughter really up the kampiness factor!Watch this one MST style.  It's a keeper!";

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes I will buy a DVD on a whim if it is cheap enough. This is one of those cases. I paid about 14 bucks including shipping. I am a fan of Sinbad films but the ones I like are Ray Harryhausen made. I never even heard of this movie before. But I saw the cool cover and the bird with the chicks head on it. It also came with another movie so I went for it figuring it couldn't be all that bad. It wasn't till after I watched it and researched it that I discovered it was actually the subject of an MST3K episode. I can only imagine the job that Joel and The Bots did on this barely watchable film. In fact I only learned afterward that it was originally a Russian film called 'Sadko' and had no connection to Sinbad. Now that makes perfect sense after watching it. 'Sadko' was made in 1953 and actually an award. But the dubbed version is what I am reviewing here. I can forgive it just for the simple fact it was made in 1953. The American distributors obviously tried to cash in on The Sinbad films. The movies even starts out with a reference to The Cyclops and The Roc. And that's where it ends any similar connection to the character of Sinbad. This 'Sinbad' is a bearded singing and harp playing guy who is totally disrespected by the rich merchants of his home village. He has the best intentions of ending the poverty starvation and overall plight of the people. He sets off of with several ships to find this bird of happiness that he has no clue where it lives to save his village. Great idea genius. He gets help from Neptune's daughter to finance the trip via some golden fish. His crewmen must past an important test to be admitted they must chug a couple pints of wine and get punched without falling! They encounter some Vikings who don't seem all that formidable and then travel to India where cock fighting is a popular sport. In India they learn about a magic bird that sings of happiness. Sinbad wins a chess match to get the bird. And to be honest the bird is the only cool effect in the whole film. A relatively hot chick who looks like EvilLyn from Heman with a bird's body. She is not the bird they are looking for but use her sleep inducing song to escape India. During a storm Sinbad jumps overboard as a sacrifice to Neptune and visits the non impressive undersea kingdom of Neptune which includes a dopey fish puppet and a cool octopus prop. Sinbad decides to give up the search for this bird and return to his true love. Upon his return he is welcomed back to the cheers of the villagers despite his failure to bring that bird home. He tells the people that happiness is here at home or something like that. And somehow the people accept this statement. What a load of BS. The guy fails and returns to the village under the same condition. What is so happy about that ?! I found this ending so contrived. I would definitely not recommend this movie. I only give 2 stars of 10 and that is because it was made in 1953.".

This looks and feels like a 1930sera film with mannered performances and oldfashioned scenery and shooting styles. The film is certainly larger than life in respect of the heroic deeds that the main character performs some of which are reminiscent of the later sword and sandal films to come out of Italy. My favourite part involves a visit to an undersea kingdom achieved by putting an aquarium in front of the screen. Fun stuff!".

Originally slated for release in February 2013 its visual effects house went bankrupt and its studio Legendary Pictures parted ways with distributor Warner Bros. The film that's finally stumbling into cinemas almost two full years later courtesy of Universal Pictures should be an unmitigated disaster. Surprisingly it's not. The film isn't exactly great but it's a largely entertaining romp that's more inspired by than strictly faithful to Joseph Delaney's series of bestselling books.Tom Ward Ben Barnes is the seventh son of a seventh son a rare genetic lineage that sets him on the path to becoming a Spook a.k.a. a slayer of the myriad evil creatures that haunt the land. He becomes the apprentice of grizzled alcoholaddled John Gregory Jeff Bridges shortly after Mother Malkin Julianne Moore an evil witch escapes her earthly prison to claim the world as her own. With only a week to go before the blood moon rises Tom trains with Gregory but finds himself distracted by the charms of Alice Alicia Vikander  a mysterious young lady with a few secrets of her own.While hardly groundbreaking in any way the story unfolds with unexpected punch. Tom's story  one in which he comes of age and comes into his own  is accompanied by plenty of action sequences courtesy of bonecrunching battles between men and other men and women who turn into soaring swooping firebreathing dragons. Tom tumbles over a cliff to avoid a pursuing monster Gregory battles a gigantic bear and wraiths of smoke and despair trail after the Spook and his apprentice as they make their way through a dark brooding forest.It helps too that the film is leavened by a welcome bite of humour. Seventh Son doesn't take itself as deadly seriously as some of its brethren in the fantasy genre do. That's why Gregory plunges into a bar brawl armed with nothing more than his flagon of beer and Tom is allowed to make quite a few cutting remarks about his purported mentor that are heartily returned with interest.Ardent fans of Delaney's books should be warned Seventh Son riffs on elements of the novels rather than staying strictly true to them. For one thing Tom is considerably older in the film. Most noticeably Malkin is a very different character than she is on the page. She's given more depth and complexity here her vile behaviour explained if not strictly justified by her past entanglements with Gregory. It's actually quite nice to see a fantasy world that doesn't simply perpetuate the trope of the wicked witch but instead dreams up characters that fall along a broad spectrum of morality.Barnes is wellcast as Tom holding his own as both a hero and quasiromantic lead. He shares a sweet though not particularly electric chemistry with Vikander who is thankfully called upon to do more than simper and flirt. But there are considerably more thrills to be had with Bridges who manages to fold charm menace and darkness into Gregory and Moore who's clearly having plenty of fun cutting her way through scenes as a whirlwind of madness and malevolence.By all accounts Seventh Son should really have been an outright flop. It may still play as such to any fantasy aficionados who are demanding greatness on the level of The Lord Of The Rings. But for pretty much everyone else Seventh Son is an entertaining undemanding film with some good ideas and a lot of fun moments. It's not a particularly great example of its genre but given its troubled production history that it's not completely execrable is probably nothing short of a miracle.".

At least never a film with a budget of 95 million dollars. The film is 102 minutes long. Had it been longer I think many more things could have been better explained. It just seemed some of the scenes were out of sequence or didn't have enough detail. Had this film had Peter Jackson or Guillermo del Toro at the helm it would have been an entirely different film. Considering the LOTR series each had about the same budget this film could have been so much more.The film seemed fragmented. It reminded me of the failed film Eragon where you suddenly go from farm boy to instantly learning Elvish knowing how to fight and just knowing everything. We need to see the characters develop.Now I'm a hard core fan of this genre. I'll be the first to admit that pairing Jeff Bridges with Julianne Moore was a great idea. While we get more background on Bridge's character than we do with other characters in the film their performances while quite acceptable could have been much better. Personally I thought Bridges portrayal of Master Gregory was well executed. Again I think the director was perhaps the main problem reigning in their performances.I keep seeing articles and reviews from people who've read the book then bash the film because the film itself is so far separated from the text. I don't like to compare books to film simply because you can go into so much more detail in a book. I have to say it. I still enjoyed the film even though it left a lot of unanswered questions for me. If you like the fantasy series as I do then go into the film without preconceptions and enjoy it for what it is entertainment. While it's not the best film to ever hit the big screen it's still fun.".

	schema:headline " Not even Alisters like Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore can save this underdeveloped and underdirected fantasy epic wannabe from its own tedium and mediocrity";
	schema:reviewBody "Hollywood has of late had a lousy track record of fantasy action epics and 'Seventh Son' which arrives just in time to close off the year is yet another blemish to add to that list. Delayed nearly a year while its production company Legendary switched studios this Universal release assembles Alisters Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore with 'The Chronicles of Narnia' star Ben Barnes for an expensive big screen adaptation of the first book of Joseph Delaney's 'The Wardstone Chronicles' against tawdry sets and secondrate visual effects.We aren't usually that critical of a film's production design but there is just something awfully dreary about the widescreen world of Russian director Sergei Bodrov's debut Englishlanguage feature. Indeed the only human city where any of the action takes place looks like it was rented right after the cast and crew of 'Game of Thrones' abandoned it while the mountain fortress which principal villain Mother Malkin makes her notsohumble abode seems like it was designed for some 1960s Bgrade sciencefiction movie. The ugliness of these greenscreened sets is even more obvious against the occasional picturesque Canadian backdrops which cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel ably captures to evoke a majestic 'Lord of the Rings' feel.Alas the unattractive visuals are just one of the litany of complaints that you are likely to have. What production designer Dante Ferretti fails to accomplish in sets visual effects designer John Dykstra also fails to make up for in postproduction. Whether the oversized orcs or shapeshifting witches Moore and her fellow consort Djimon Hounsou transform into dragons while others transform into creatures with reptilianlike tongues or Hindu deitylike arms the CG effects for what was once intended to be a franchise tentpole are both unimaginatively conceived and poorly executed even more appalling when viewed in postconversion 3D or worse on an IMAX screen.And yet to fault its technical shortcomings seems at least a tad unfair in particular because the movie's problems are much more fundamental. For one despite boasting an impressive team of screenwriters including Matt Greenberg Charles Leavitt and Steven Knight there is hardly a story here. Without any context we start with a younger Jeff Bridges imprisoning the Queen Witch Mother Malkin Moore up in the mountains. The impending dawn of the onceacentury blood moon lends her strength to break out of her metal confines and in an early sequence confront her jailer Master Gregory Bridges and his notsolucky apprentice Billy Game of Thrones' Kit Harington. When that reunion ends with Billy dead Gregory sets out recruiting a new seventh son of a seventh son Thomas Barnes who so happens to be suffering from elliptic visions of Gregory and Malkin.In narrative jargon Thomas is The Chosen One the anointed protg who under the tutelage of Master Gregory will become his very equal and take his place among the elite group of knights who call themselves the Falcon. There is no doubt during the movie even when his life seems to be in mortal danger that Thomas will live to see the death of Mother Malkin and perhaps even the light of another sequel. There is also no doubt despite Gregory's initial reservations that Thomas will be ready within the span of just seven days to defeat the evil that Malkin possesses within her gothlike getup. And for that matter there is no doubt that Thomas will find true love in Alice Swedish actress Alicia Vikander a witch whom he rescues from the town mob and who turns out to be the daughter of Malkin's younger sister.The plotting is as straightforward as it gets and functions no more than to connect the numerous noisy action sequences together. There is also hardly any character to speak of each one of them leading or supporting mere stock types that you would be familiar with from countless other such fantasy flicks. The latter is also why we feel sorry for Bridges a fine actor who's played the grizzled veteran one too many times of late in 'R.I.P.D.' and 'The Giver' and is here trying not to sound condescending while delivering lame oneliners with a distinct twang. Moore too is an equally fine actress in her own right utterly wasted in a thankless role and together what chemistry the pair had in 'The Big Lebowski' is sorely missing in their first reunion since.If the decision to cast two acclaimed actors to lend legitimacy to the project does nothing to help the film the casting of its younger actors also fails to do it any favours. Barnes tries his best to project fresheyed enthusiasm but the late decision to cast the 31 yearold actor in the role of a 17yearold  instead of 'The Hunger Games'' Sam Claflin is ultimately a misguided one. He also shares too little chemistry with Vikander who looks appropriately beguiling but is little much else. Barnes and Vikander are also stuck in an awkward romance which is bound to inspire some unintended giggles especially for a sequence where the two supposedly exchange loving glances while lying together in bed. There is hardly anything fascinating about 'Seventh Son' whose title belongs better in a tongue twister than in an expensive and extravagant swordsanddragons epic. Yes there is good reason indeed why former studio Warner Bros had dragged its feet in releasing this and what a relief it must have felt that it need not try to justify why it decided to do so when it already has an entire trilogy in 'The Hobbit'. No matter that the director is a twotime Academy Award nominee for his Russian films 'Prisoner of the Mountains' and 'Mongol' his Hollywood foray is an embarrassing misstep that he would no doubt want to be forgotten as soon as possible. He needn't worry to spare yourself the agony of sitting through yet another disappointing fantasy wannabe epic go find any one of the other sons and just avoid the Seventh.".

Thomas Ward Ben Barnes is chosen to be Gregory's new apprentice. And there you go an actionpacked adventure with perilous monsters and witches lurking. Nothing in the movie surprises even the twists have been seen before. There are a few set pieces including a fullblown climax that use extensive CGI. Although entertaining to watch they are lacking in the creativity department. Acting wise is alright. Music is generic but does elevate a sense of peril during the action.3D It is surprisingly decent. I thought it would be another sloppy postconverted 3D movie that barely has depth. The 3D effects work the most during the CGI set pieces with monsters chomping right at your face. It has a reasonable amount of depth between characters and the background. Overall Is it worth to watch it in cinema? Only if you are interested in young adult adaptations. If you don't you are not missing much. It has all the clichs what a fantasy period movie has and does not break any new ground. Is it worth the wait? Probably not.

It was not bad but not good or anything new.The story is clich and predictable as pretty much anything. I knew exactly how it would go down throughout the entire film.The pace is somewhat inconsistent with a few parts that rush and a few parts that drag.The acting is fine. Jeff Bridges did his best imitation of himself from True Grit which was only soso believable. Ben Barnes did his best impression of himself as Prince Caspian minus the accent. So he was convincing at least. Julianna Moore is the villain and she was the best one in it.The characters are all clich and offered nothing new.The music. I'm going to go back to this one.The CGI was not as bad as the trailer but not great. The originality the film offered in the villains was not terrible either. They just played Dark Souls and said Hey! Let's use all of the villains! There are some scenes that are pretty witty and some others that are pretty entertaining. So it was enjoyable to an extent.So my least favorite thing about the film was the music. Right off the bat I noticed. Here is what happened They were done with the editing and somebody said Oh guys! We forgot music! and another guy answered Oh crap! It's okay just use music from Game of Thrones Clash of the Titans Wrath of the Titans and Robin Hood! Problem solved! Oh my gosh I knew every song that played. And they picked two of my favorite soundtracks to use! So totally took me out of the moment. All of the moments. All of them.Anyway Seventh Son is nothing new and has some elements like the freaking music that make it not good. However it has some entertainment value to it so really if you don't care about predictability and music Seventh Son would actually be worth watching on Nexflix.It is PG13 for some light violence scaryish images dealings with things like sorcery and a random Fword. Because that existed?".

	schema:reviewBody "Set in medieval times in Europe somewhere Seventh Son brings us back to a time when supernatural beings like witches ghosts ghasts and the like wreak terror on the countryside. The people depend on a special knight called the Spook to fight these creatures and restore peace. Master Gregory is the last spook and he is getting on in age. In his last big fight with the grand witch Mother Malkin he lost his latest apprentice Billy. Gregory searches for another seventh son of a seventh son to take his place. His quest leads him to the farm of the Wards. As the young impulsive Tom heeds the Spook's call will he be up to the task of becoming the new Spook before Mother Malkin fully regains her powers by the night of the blood moon? Or will Tom's falling for the charms of pretty Alice distract him from his destiny?Cut down to its basic storyline you would see a very common basic plot in many an adventure film an old master training an heirapparent to his position. This film takes that plot and brings into it fantastic monsters in action and teenage romance in bloom.Ben Barnes plays Tom Ward. Barnes first gained attention as Prince Caspian in the Narnia films though his career did not really fly too much. He takes another stab at stardom with yet another action fantasy with this one. Already a adult man Barnes seemed too old for the character he is supposed to play. Anyhow he still has a youthful mien to pull it off. I think he was cast so that a romance angle can be developed as well.Jeff Bridges plays Master Gregory. He is at his hammy best here and he looks like he had a good time filming this. In fact Bridges felt like he just reprised his role in last year's RIPD where he was a senior ghost policeman training a new recruit. Bridges had some witty ripostes which added the requisite humor to the proceedings.Julianne Moore goes all campy playing Mother Malkin with evil relish and glee. She gets to wear more witchychic than Maleficent and she seemed to be having a field day with this overthetop character much unlike the more serious and quiet ones she is more known for. In addition she and her coven of powerful witches played by Antje Traue Djimon Hounsou Jason Scott Lee among others get to transform into dragons and similarly fantastic beasts thanks to neat and nifty computer generated special effects. This film is based on the young adult novel The Spook's Apprentice written by Joseph Delaney. Unlike the atmospheric creepy book it was based on the film is makes it more of an action fantasy for cinematic verve. Tom and Alice in the book are both preteens. The witch characters did not fit their descriptions in the book as well. They did not turn into animals for one. In fact one of the side characters the deformed humanoid Tusk even shifts over from evil in the book to good in the film.The visual effects were hit and miss some like the creature transformations were impressive and seamless but some like the conflagrations looked oldfashioned and garishly fake. Book fans may be disappointed by the major deviations from the original tale. Those who are unfamiliar with the book though will be entertained but will definitely feel that the story being told by director Sergey Bodrov follows a tired and very familiar formula. 610.".

Best comparison i can give is the Witcher universe you honestly change the names and the plot and you can step in Geralt's world. And also there is a little bit of Dark Souls in there. I liked some of the cgi but there is also some really bad for a 2014 film. People will call me crazy but i think its better than the 2nd and 3rd Hobbit movies which were full of unnecessary cgi and it's really bloated.

But what is the true intention of Alice? Will they succeed in destroying the powerful Mother Malkin?Seventh Son is a fantasy film indicated for fans of the genre. The story is full of action with romance funny situations and great CGI. There is a cameo of Kit Jon Snow Harington in the role of Master Gregory's apprentice the gorgeous Julianne Moore does not seem to age and performs the evil Mother Malkin Olivia Williams has a minor but important role of the mother and good witch the Swedish actress Antje Traue the Ava of ExMachina is very beautiful and talented.

	schema:reviewBody "Seventh Son exceeded my expeditions by a great deal. I had no high hopes for this movie in the first place but I thought it would at least be a cheesy clichd fantasy movie that just might be good. Well it definitely was clichd and slightly cheesy but I enjoyed it way more than I thought I would. First off the story and plot were pretty basic. The movie certainly had its cheesy oneliners and the plot definitely was very clichd with the typical good vs. evil and a nobody boy needs to fulfill his destiny. But other than that the story and plot were pretty basic and didn't require much thinking. I for one understood what was happening for most of the time. There were moments in the movie that just happened and then weren't explained at all. Those were the moments where I was like So why did that happen? The acting... was not that bad actually. I was particularly impressed with Ben Barnes in the lead role. Julianne Moore was a pretty good evil witch and all the other supporting actors and actresses fit surprisingly well in their roles. The real downfall though is Jeff Bridges. His acting was just kind of terrible I have to admit. His voice was the main problem it being almost inaudible. I suppose he wanted to embrace Master Gregory's scruffy manner but it did not really work out. Now about the actual seeing and hearing. The music was kind of that usual epic fantasy music but none the less it fit well with the movie. Before I start on visual effects I want to say that the color correction on this movie in the trailers looked quite ugly but it turns out that the actual movie is just fine especially on a big screen. Anyway the visual effects were generally pretty good. Judging by the trailers and my own instincts I thought they were going to be at best mediocre. But it turns out they were quite good. There were some moments where I thought Yup they definitely used green screen for that shot or there were moments were the VFX themselves were just not quite finished or not good in general. But all in all they were actually pretty good.In the end Seventh Son is an extremely fun cheesy adventure movie that is worth seeing in theaters. If you go in with low expectations or an open mind you will enjoy it immensely.".

	onyx:emotionText "Seventh Son exceeded my expeditions by a great deal. I had no high hopes for this movie in the first place but I thought it would at least be a cheesy clichd fantasy movie that just might be good. Well it definitely was clichd and slightly cheesy but I enjoyed it way more than I thought I would. First off the story and plot were pretty basic. The movie certainly had its cheesy oneliners and the plot definitely was very clichd with the typical good vs. evil and a nobody boy needs to fulfill his destiny. But other than that the story and plot were pretty basic and didn't require much thinking. I for one understood what was happening for most of the time. There were moments in the movie that just happened and then weren't explained at all. Those were the moments where I was like So why did that happen? The acting... was not that bad actually. I was particularly impressed with Ben Barnes in the lead role. Julianne Moore was a pretty good evil witch and all the other supporting actors and actresses fit surprisingly well in their roles.

	schema:reviewBody "A List of 31 Reasons Why Any Human Should Avoid This Film At ALL Costs.1. It obliterated a unique series of novels 2. Abysmal casting choices 3. It is an English story yet it's set in the USA 4. The writing is equivalent to that of fan fiction 5. One dimensional characters that you're supposed to care about 6. Terrible acting 7. Why is the main character British when everyone else is American? 8. Jeff Bridges does his best attempt at Gandalf's voice and fails 9. Generic storylines 10. Characters have under developed and ever changing backstories 11. The Spook has a code of honor... when he feels like it. 12. Writers can't decide whether they're ripping off Jackie Chan's 'Drunken Master' or every other stereotypical fantasy film in history. 13. The characters are disagreeable and are not developed from start to finish. 14. The fact that Disney decided that the titanic needed a sequel is the one thing more ridiculous than the claim that anyone involved in the creation this film actually read the source material. 15. How is Tom the Seventh Son when he has at least one sister rendering him at best the sixth son. 16. Is the only person who cares that Tom's mum died Tom? I mean we only see her three times in the film and in one of those scenes she's already carked it. 17. Tom and Alice's love 'story' is less of a story and only slightly less shallow than 50SOG. 18. Everyone is useless at fighting until the last scene... convenient. 19. Instead of employing people who appreciate the source material they seemingly employed a 13 year old boy as casting director who promptly cast the first two women who looked good in a low cut neckline into the roles of two witches who in the books are vile complex creatures hundred of years old in the form of haggard old women. 20. I'm surprised that the creators of Alien haven't sued for a rather 'unique' looking tail that Mother Malkin has. 21. The hero of this film would be better if he was the dragonborn not a Spook because dragons should NOT be in this movie. 22. The special effects are the 2014 equivalent of Eragon's and are overused. 23. This is supposed to be a dark fantasy epic not the middle ages version of Michael Bay's Transformers with characters making as many outofcharacter quips and jokes as possible. 24. The USA was not settled in with advanced citadels and cities within the time period of this film and would have been a very basic civilization at the time. 25. They decided to eradicate the individuality of the original story and replace it with a good old 'we have until insert natural phenomenon here to defeat insert name of villains here story line 26. I would have snapped the disc of this movie if it hadn't cost me 7. 27. The blurb of this film is so generic reading it made me want to sit and watch Not Another Teen Movie 28. Watching this movie was more disappointing than Assassins Creed 3... yet another thing set in America with generic dull and one dimensional characters. 29. The magical light bulb in Jeff Bridges' staff is the least lore friendly thing I've seen since Thomas the Tank Engine in Skyrim. 30. Spooks are against all witches because they use magic ... both Tom and Gregory use magic. 31. This is the least faithful piece of filth to it's source material since Doom the 2004 movie and it is appalling that the author of the books Joseph Delaney allowed this butchery of something with so much potential.N.B This is probably a highly bias review due to the fact that I grew up reading these books and was so disappointed with this movie. So whilst I still would actively discourage anybody who has read the books from watching this film I would say that it is suitable for any younger viewers who have not watched many films of this genre.".

	schema:headline " An unfortunate failure that was actually very very entertaining";
	schema:reviewBody "After seeing a trailer or two I was actually quite excited about seeing Seventh Son. Its been awhile since I've seen a good fantasy medieval film and I was looking forward to it. I am very pleased to say that this was nearly a perfect and fun popcorn flick and well worth my time. I'm actually very disappointed that it isn't doing better because I think they could certainly have turned this into a franchise and I couldn't help but think that the film leads into what could be a really terrific TV Series as well. The film however tanked and that won't be happening but please don't let that deter you from checking this out especially if you enjoy the genre. The story is terrific the cinematography is great and the story is decent. It has a good cast and terrific action scenes. It has an old school fantasy vibe to it but everything works quite well. It isn't brilliant and it would never take home any awards but I was completely entertained and I would watch it again and that marks a good film in my book. The pacing is good and it has plenty of action to keep you hooked. The romantic storyline is also surprisingly good as well.Ben Barnes leads the cast very well as the latest apprentice to a monster hunter. Barnes has a lot of charisma on screen and he pulls off the role well. I think that at the very least he should get noticed for his part in the film. The always amazing Jeff Bridges plays the haggard and grizzled hunter. He steals every scene he is in although I'm getting a little tired of his grumbling and muffled growl lately and he and Barnes are terrific together. Bridges wins you over quickly and is a great character. Julianne Moore who I have decided to now become a fan of after years of being annoyed by her because of her literally brilliant performance in Still Alice is pretty good as the evil villainess and witch. She is a little campy and over the top but it works in the context of the film and the story between her and Bridges is quite good. Alicia Vikander is beautiful first of all but she does well as the romantic lead for Barnes. They have really good chemistry and some great scenes together. The various cameos of villains and heroes along the way are familiar and all quite good.The story is that this film went through some very hard times during production including switching directors and casting issues and all kinds of things. Usually a film that has that many issues ends up not doing well and this was no exception. Director Sergey Bodrov has a fair bit of experience in the genre and behind the camera but I'm not sure he knew what to do with this sort of budget and that might be his biggest problem. Still he does some amazing things with the scenery and the special effects are excellent. There really is truly nothing wrong with this film. I don't understand all the backlash against it. Its not Lord of The Rings but it is very entertaining and that for me is good enough! I do absolutely recommend giving it a chance. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Seventh Son is a classic struggle between knights and witches with a young love story and a tragic longago love story. It is a typical fantasy told with bits of heart and bits of drama. You will enjoy the morphing of animals into humans and the abundant battles with beasts and monsters. Perhaps there are too many repetitive yawninducing CG battles. Although the storyline is somewhat predictable it has enough twists and revelations to keep the audience somewhat excited. The opening scene is fascinating the witch being locked away by a mysterious man and then fastforward passingoftime in what it looks like is a Grand CanyonHighlands hybrid landscape. During the whole movie the scenery is very enjoyable including the medieval villages and castles. Certainly Julianne Moore impersonation as the evil shapeshifter witch is spellbinding! And then there are the dragonsloved that too! The chosen boy to become apprentice has all these visions that foreshadow what's coming next. Along the entire movie the visuals are dulled by a certain haze or fogI guess that's the mood the director wants to convey for the film.The centerpiece of the story is the witch and revolving around that is the training of the seventh son. After the introduction we then meet Gregory Jeff Bridges. and we learn what he wants to kill all witches. Jeff Bridges is sort of a humorous medieval BuffaloBilllooking knight determined to destroy the witchMother Malkin Julianne Moore and to accomplish that he recruits the Seventh Son the country boy Tom Ben Barnes. We also learn that the witch wants revenge and she'll organize her forces to take power. When we meet Tom the tobeapprentice we learn that he wants a different life and that he has a strong bond with his mother who gives him a special pendant before he goes with the teacher Jeff Bridges. We later discover some truths about Tom and about Gregory that give us a new insight into these characters. This pendant and the emphasis on the mother have a reason to bethese two elements become relevant later in the story. Next appears a young witch who will captivate Tom's heart. Overall the performances are passionless except for the witch herself. Perhaps the story spends more time in battles than in character exploration. My favorite part of the movie is the third act suddenly there's drama! In the end we learn that there are good witches and bad witches and that a change of heart is possible. This is no Lord of the Rings and is not much of a memorable movie but it is entertaining. It's based on a fantasy novelThe Last Apprenticethe Revenge of the Witch. Actually Seventh Son reminds me of that Michelle Pfeiffer witch film Stardust and also of the Chronicles of Narnia. Certainly this is a film worth watching. I thought I wouldn't but I'm planning to watch this movie a second time. There's something compelling about it and I want to find out what it is...Enjoy.Thanks for reading! Cheers.".

I love the desolate setting of an science facility in the cold lifeless continent of Antartica. There is always something creepy and thrilling about being so far from civilization and life sustaining climate the movie had a similar creepiness to some other thrillers that take place in deep space. The plot and setting were original and keep you guessing throughout the movie. The suspense and thrills were more likened to a horror movie or a slasher film but I say that in a good way. My 17 year old daughter and wife had to turn their eyes away for many scenes in fear and anticipation.I like to judge movies by what their intent is. I try and compare Old School to Gone with the Wind for example... 2 completely different audiences and intents but both great movies that deliver what they try to deliver. In my opinion Whiteout delivered what it tried to deliver a scary interesting beautiful thrilling escape. Exactly what I wanted to see on a cold Friday night in front of the fire!".

But in a world where old Charlie Chan potboilers have a cult following and boneheaded Spielberg spectaculars are considered works of genius I'd say that Whiteout definitely has a place.What did I like about Whiteout? I loved the setting. ANY movie set in the confines of an Antarctic research station is okay with me. There aren't nearly enough of them! I loved the characters. Kate Beckinsale isn't in the front ranks of thespians but she's a solid leading lady and brings a good mix of likability vulnerability and toughness to this part. The supporting characters are just fine as well. I loved the idea of setting an actionmystery in this odd locale and I greatly enjoyed the way the mystery unraveled  predictable though it may have been. And I loved the various ways that the frozen environment is brought in as an element in the story.What did I hate? Not a thing. True the cold is not treated realistically. Too many people walking around bareheaded and such. Yes it's a dopey Hollywood convention. But in a little action flick like this one I wasn't bothered  at all. Did I hate the acting? No. It was just right for this kind of film. Did I have problems with the writing? Okay... there were a few bits of logic that could have been tighter. But again no worse than in many movies that get a 1010 from every blockhead on Earth. I won't itemize... this review is going to get enough downchecks as it is.Bottom line Whiteout is a pile of fun. It's a 'genre' film with few if any artistic pretensions. But it delivers the goods where it counts. I've watched it several times on DVD and expect to enjoy it quite a few more. If you don't get it go watch some MerchantIvory drawing room masterpiece and we'll all be happy.".

A hostile environment provides a great backdrop for an ActionCrimeDramaThrillerIMDb genres such as WHITEOUT. And Antarctica is just about as hostile as it gets! The film does get off to a really GREAT start. While in the theater my enjoyment was genuine during 80 to 90 of the movie...Just after viewing 7.5 was my rating...But after a few hours of cerebral ricocheting I realized that perhaps I'd allowed my emotions a little too much free reign permitting myself to be a partial victim of WHITEOUT's cinematic snow job!...YES.. I was SnowBlinded by the light! Therefore my revised rating is 6! I'll explain WHITEOUT does have a few topnotch scenes where director Dominic Sena SwordfishGONE in 60 Seconds really manages to work the Hostile Environment angle I mentioned at the beginning to its fullest! However this very unique initial strength proves eventually to be a tremendous constraint on the overall film. During the first half of WHITEOUT there are several scenes where the safe haven homebase compound is left behind and helicopter trips are taken as part of an ongoing murder investigation. But the allwhite outdoors soon gets a little drab and painfully bright on the eyes.During most of the last half of the film weather conditions force everyone to pretty much stay inside the compound which also provides rather austere viewer surroundings. This movie suffered from insufficient character development and overreliance on several actionthrillerslasher scenes which although exciting and wellexecuted were not enough to sustain WHITEOUT at a solid 8 for its duration! In any case 6.....ENJOYDISFRUTELA! Any comments questions or observations in English or Espaol are most welcome!".

I give big props to the film cast for having to go through such a rigorous weather treatment but it made for a fairly effective movie. The negative thing about Whiteout though is I didn't think it took advantage of its immense potential. It's definitely watchable and fairly entertaining but it could have been a film to remember with that type of setting and the plot and unfortunately I guessed the twist at the end halfway through the movie. Kate Beckinsale makes for a very good lead while being believable at the same time and that's very important for a film like this. Whiteout has it's fair share of spooky moments the atmosphere is great and in the end I was entertained for the most part but it could have been so much more.Performances. Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous to look at but also a pretty good actress too. She's likable and her Feistyness but also vulnerability worked well for her. Gabriel Macht does well as Pryce he was pretty charismatic. Tom Skerritt is OK as the Doctor I suppose he had a presence. Columbus Short is likable as Delfy. Alex O'Loughlin is quite intense in his role.Bottom line. It's worth a watch on Telly or DVD that's for sure it passes the time well.610".

I think Gabriel Macht is an extremely good looking guy but based on this film he is a horrendous actor. Kate Beckinsale was okay as the lead... She had her moments. The dialogue was so cheesy though. And the film was just also very predictable and tedious. The flashback scenes in particular got pretty annoying as pretty much the same exact scene was repeated at least 3 or 4 times throughout the movie.But perhaps the best aspect of the film is the scenery. The outside shots were beautiful. The whole idea of being on Antarctica was fascinating and is perhaps the main reason why I was able to put up with many of its flaws.

Of course The Matrix had justification but we've seen the same superhuman gravity defying toocoolforschool characteristics attach themselves to even ordinary people in ordinary circumstances and maybe it's gone a little too far. In WHITEOUT our heroine is not a 10th degree black belt not armed with 200 lbs of ammo not able to do backflips over exploding grenades  such things as we've come to expect in movies. Instead WHITEOUT gives us a somewhat sober  realistic portrayal of what action is like in the real world. It's almost like a throwback to the 70s when special effects played a minor role in films and the human themes were forefront.I'm not saying either type of film is inherently better than the other all I'm saying is if you go into this film expecting Ultraviolet or Resident Evil you will most certainly be put to sleep within the first half hour. If instead you go into it expecting something more like the 70s classics Coma or Stepford Wives where the heroine is human and fallible I think you'll really enjoy this.A lot of the film's power centers around the heroine's human side and accordingly she reacts in human ways. When seriously injured she doesn't brush it off with an I ain't got time to bleed macho attitude. She doesn't just take a swig of whiskey and calmly perform surgery on herself like we've come to expect from our action heroes. No she cries like a baby which is what you or I would do if we just got sliced admit it tough guys! She's not some soulless robot who can kill dozens of people without flinching. She like a real human carefully considers the repercussions each time she has to pull the trigger. Granted this slows the pacing of the action considerably but hey welcome to the real world.With all that in mind the story is pretty basic as far as murdermysteriesintheAntarctic go. But if you focus on the underlying human story instead of the thrills  chills it's a refreshing change from the cartoony action flicks of recent years. For similar reality checks I highly recommend The Merry Gentleman crime drama Moon scifi and Exorcist 3 horror.".

For similar reality checks I highly recommend The Merry Gentleman crime drama Moon scifi and Exorcist 3 horror.";

Her agent should be shot for getting her involved in the films she has been associated with lately.Whiteout has it all  Starts with a long unnecessarily drawn out shower scene with a preshower shot focused on KB bending over in her underwear right into the camera. Not that I mind but a total Bmovie skinamax move. It is followed up with a pointless story that lacked any originality except I guess the location that included routine plot points and every EXPECTED twist!! We even get an uninspired contrived history for KB's character. Add some REAL BAD dialogue at times you know the kind  the writers are not sure the audience will get the absolute obvious so they have a character actually say the obvious out loud. They have to spell it out for all the morons they must be pandering and you got a BMovie with what I assume is still an Alist star??? The directing does not help nor does the editing whom I'll give a pass since the director handed the editor Bmovie scenes. In all the film is uninspired routine and mostly flawed with an inconsistent feel on every level.At some points I would have given this film a 3 mostly when that awful dialogue would proceed a moment here and there a 5. But luckily the best performance came from Tom Skerritt who managed to maintain a level of quality the rest involved could not and his presence near the end saved a lower rating yes its true parts of this film deserve lower than the overall 4.No need to spend you hard earned money on this at the box office mess. Rent it on DVD if your REALLY bored or have an unlimited plan.or wait till skinamax shows it!! It may be worth the 1 Red Box rental.".

I remember there being lots and lots of snow loose plot points and bad Austrailan accents blowing around. Oh and there was Kate Beckinsale in there  somewhere  too I believe. I can't really recall too much else mainly because in only a short running time it lapped itself with a blizzard of boredom.The movie opens with a Russian transport plane hosting a bewildering gun battle at 10000 feet in 1957. No one knows what's happening  on the aircraft or in the audience. Soon though the scene shifts to the present where U.S. Marshal Carrie Stetko Beckinsale Van Helsing The Aviator the Underground Evolution franchise is hold up on a South Pole government outpost after shooting someone in a series of flashbacks.Her and a friend Dr. John Fury Tom Skerrit MASH Alien Top Gun discover a frozen body near the plane crash site and the investigation begins. Basically the picture then becomes a bit of Alien and John Carpenter's The Thing with a side order of CSI Antartica with a mysterious United Nations agent Robert Pryce Gabriel Macht The Good Shepherd The Spirit joining in on the fun.While trying to unravel the secret of just what was aboard that Russian airplane an annoying Aussie also tries to nose in on the action while a subtropical hurricane comes blowing in just for laughs. All in all like the location it takes place in this film is a frozen bleak lonely dark desolate enterprise with little warmth or chemistry between the characters.Not to mention the terrible dialogue the confusing final fight sequences everyone's in heavy parkas so no one knows WHAT'S going on and flashbacks that flash back to scenes which took place 10 seconds before! Movie has more than an appropriate title as well as someone should have used some white out to cull this silly script into the onehour Fox TV series it should have been all along.".

The snowbased setting including vicious blizzards give it a reasonably intriguing and scenic feel so much that the setting is in itself a bit of a character.I do recall in my review of Vacancy also starring Beckinsale that her visual appeal was ridiculously underused and she looked almost grubby. I couldn't understand why she'd be cast in that role  well the guys behind Whiteout seem to have taken that criticism quite seriously. While she is covered head to toe in winter clothes for 99 of the movie there is one gratuitous semifully nude scene which is completely unnecessary and is purely there because she's hot enough to carry it off. I'm not really objecting! Getting back on track Whiteout is a decent enough thriller pretty well made and well directed that it feels fairly short and fast moving while being pretty entertaining. It's not going to win any awards but don't take it too seriously and you'll get a kick out of it.Pretty good.".

When a pilot reports that he might have seen a copse in the snow U.S. Marshall Carrie Stetko Kate Beckinsale flies to the location with the pilot Delfy Columbus Short and Dr. John Fury Tom Skerritt to investigate. Carrie has a traumatic experience in Miami and has already sent her resignation letter. They discover that the dead man is the geologist Weiss Marc James Beauchamp that is missing with two other scientists further Carrie finds evidences that he was murdered. When Carrie returns to the station she receives a call from the abandoned Russian Vostok Station from one of the missing technicians and when she arrives in the station she finds him dead. The killer tries to kill her and Carrie succeeds to escape but freezes her hand without gloves. When she returns to the base Dr. Fury has to amputate two fingers from her hand due to the injuries and the UN agent Robert Pryce Gabriel Macht is assigned to investigate the first murder case in Antarctica. Carrie teams up with Robert and together with Delfy they discover a Russian airplane that crashed after a shootout in 1957. They find the frozen corpses of the crew and that six mysterious cylinders have vanished from the cargo compartment. Carrie and Robert have to disclose the identity of the killer and the cargo before the arrival of the storm. Without is an effective thriller with a good story but a disappointing conclusion. The load of the mysterious cylinders and the identity of the partner of the killer are unexpected but I was expecting a better ending specially considering that the Russian plane crashed in the Cold War period. Kate Beckinsale has a great performance in the role of a frail agent that requested the post in Antarctica as a kind of self punishment for a traumatic experience in the past caused by a betrayal. The locations and special effects are convincing. My vote is six.Title Brazil Terror na Antrtida Terror in the Antarctica".

One of the most boring suspense films in recent memory and Dominic Sena's leaden direction particularly in the titular climax should have him hand in his DGA card.";

	schema:reviewBody "Killer Joe is a rollercoaster of a movie. At first it seems like a dark comedy then a crime drama plot starts to uncover and by the end it becomes downright terrifying. I'm a sucker for these kinds of movies and Killer Joe absolutely nails everything it goes for. This kind of story couldn't be pulled off without the right director. Thankfully William Friedkin knocks it out of the park. You can smell the white trash emanating from the screen. Every detail of every action is given the right amount of attention every shot has purpose. Not one second is gone to waste. And in order for a story like this to truly resonate you'd need competent actors and I don't think you could find a more perfect cast for Killer Joe if you tried. McConaughey is absolutely mesmerizing as this badass detective who's a hitman on the side. The story revolves around a trailer trash family and their plan to exploit an insurance policy on the husband's exwife because the son got wrapped up in a bad drug deal so they hire Killer Joe to do the job. Little do they know Killer Joe does not fck around. It's a graphic movie but it's not gratuitous. There's a reason for everything that is shown. And the narrative slowly builds to an explosive climax that leaves you flabbergasted. Seriously the final scene in this movie which is about 10 minutes long is absolutely phenomenal. Shocking riveting unsettling. Matthew McConaughey is downright villainous in this role. It's hard to call him a villain because he's straightforward in his motivations much like it's hard to call the family the heroes because they're a bunch of moronic assholes except the daughter who just doesn't know any better. The line between good and evil is blurred to the point of nonexistence with Joe epitomizing this duality being the half detective half gunforhire hardass that he is. It's quite poetic really. The characters in this movie are scum and they all get what's coming to them.Killer Joe is a lot of things but one thing it's not is scatterbrained. It's entirely focused and cohesive. All the genres it glosses over fit right into this depraved story arc and it grips you to the screen from beginning to end. This movie certainly isn't for everyone but if you can stomach Killer Joe you won't soon forget it.".

It's always refreshing when your first though when this ends is  where did THAT come from? By far this is Matthew McConaughey's most WTFbadass performance with touches of Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet and even Anton Chigurh. He's such a fantastic seductive snakelike villain here because after the first couple of times you see him you're not quite sure where he'll go. Friedkin takes this material into some VERY dark places I imagine based off of the play once again like 'Bug' from Tracy Letts and if you aren't offended after the first ten minutes you just gotta hang on for the rest of the ride. It's a twistedfk filmnoir comedy of horrors where morality is so screwed that you have to laugh to not recoil from where it goes ultimately. The ending had me howling with laughter recoiling in pain and just stunned by McConaughey suddenly shattering an image he's built up for himself over the past fifteen years as a romcom hack. It's his film along with the unlikelyattractive actress Juno Temple who has a seduction scene with 'Killer Joe' that is edgeofyourseat.

Plot finds Hirsch as Chris Smith who because he is in severe debt to local thugs hatches a plan to bump off his waster of a mother and claim the life insurance. Roping in the rest of his trailer dwelling family he hires Killer Joe McConaughey a cop with a sideline in murder but the Smith's have no idea just what price they will have to pay for his services.So pulpy so amusingly dark Killer Joe is one of those films that will sit at the top of many film fan's best of lists for 2012. Yet if someone came up to me and declared it one of the worst then I certainly will understand. Undeniably it has no widespread appeal you either get it or you don't you will either laugh along with Friedkin and his dark observations or you will feel the whole thing is just too ugly to be entertainment. Man it's good to have Friedkin back pushing peoples buttons!Filmed in Texas in under three weeks Killer Joe is a film that walks the fine line of misogyny and perversity for perversity's sake. But it never falls over that mark even though these are scummy characters living in a scummy world where there's sex and violence and violent simulated sex and nudity all of which is cloaked by a sweaty crime gone wrong caper. Much of the film is dialogue driven rest assured this is very talky but the director wrings out much tension and salaciousness from every character interaction the slowburn approach only heightening the sense of dread. When the finale comes and it's a crackerjack ending there's an almost merciful release that it's all over. These are people you wouldn't want to hang out with ever only there's Friedkin chuckling away to himself having made us spend an hour and forty minutes with this grime laden crew. If you feel like you need a bath afterwards that's perfectly natural.Friedkin has garnered terrific performances from a top line cast. Hirsch powderkeg Church naievity extraordinaire Temple virginal piggy in the middle and Gershon bold and suspicious are all giving disturbing credibility to the material but as good as they are they are trumped considerably by McConaughey. One of the most frustrating actors working today much like Cage a ream of poor movies adorn his CV but once in a while he throws in a performance of such genuine quality that it begs to be acknowledged by his peers. Here as Killer Joe he lays on a Faust like menace delivering his lines with clinically calm precision yet still there's a glint in his eye we know a black heart beats there but he can charm a snake out of its basket a girl out of her underwear...Unflinching direction bravura performances and neonoir at its near best one of the best films of 2012 so far.

	schema:reviewBody "Famed director William Friedkin The Exorcist returns to fine form. Killer Joe directed by Friedlkin and based on a Tracy Letts storyscreenplay is a fine rendition of the old player getting played murder plot. A vignette of white trash playing out some worst case scenarios with thankfully much more photogenic roleplayers.The film hangs on the roles of three central characters. The protagonist is a twentyish down and out loser named Chris played by Emile Hirsch. Hirsch brings a much grittier less Bohemian Johnny Depp to the table and it works here. His character is smart enough to know he's in deep and empty enough to unwittingly dig his hole ever deeper. His younger sister Dottie played by Juno Temple is an extremely unique character. She's both high functioning and almost mentally deficient in her total naivet' which we are led to think is a mental quirk. She exudes a kind a helplessness with natural beauty that can draw one in. Juno Temple a relatively new face to American audiences is quite effective in her portrayal of this integral character. Finally Matthew McConaughey is perfect in what is actually a supporting role in spite of being the the title character Killer Joe. McConaughey is in his best element where he is reined in from Hollywood bombast instead dripping with a sleazy lawmankiller persona. These three characters are this movie aptly supported by Gershon's conniving Sharla and Thomas Hayden Church's witless Ansel.Killer Joe has a down and dirty indie feel which is totally right. The cinematography is immediate and not artsy in any way as if you are clearly seeing something you wish wasn't happening. The final quarter ramps up with a tour 'de force of the macabre supplied by McConaughey's character and taken home with a kind of surprise looseend whambam finale. All in all this really works and separates itself from more typical murder stories recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "William Friedkin's Killer Joe proclaims itself as a totally twisted deepfried Texas redneck trailer park murder story but to be fair I'm not sure that is even an accurate summation. Prior to viewing the film I saw it called everything from sick to wild to weird to creepy to subversive to crazy to just plain awful and the only one I can marginally agree with is weird. This is one of the strangest releases of the year but I believe sick is a huge exaggeration.I too feel the NC17 rating this film proudly bears is a bit much. If the film lacked a full frontal Gina Gershon and Matthew McConaughey I'm sure it would've easily obtained a strong Rrating. The MPAA's bias for sexual content over violent content is wildly known and just the fact that they oversimplify the violence in this film to a scene of brutality had me laughing. The film includes some of the most hardhitting scenes of combat that I've seen in any other film this year and I'd absolutely love to know just what scene the MPAA was referring to in the first place.The film centers around the family of twentysomething Chris Smith played fantastically by Emile Hirsch assuming the type of role he should continue to seek out a lowlife drug dealer residing in a Texas trailer park with his dimwitted father Ansel Thomas Haden Church his annoying stepmother Sharla Gina Gershon and mentally disabled sister Dottie Juno Temple. Chris has plunged himself into debt with another local dealer and consults his father about his biological mother and her 50000 insurance payoff that would be collected by Dottie if she were to die. Chris proposes the idea to hire Killer Joe Cooper Matthew McConaughey a sleazy cop who also works as an assassin to kill his mother and receive a cut of the insurance money with him Ansel and Sharla getting a good chunk of the profits. However things become incredibly twisted when Killer Joe begins to fall in love with Dottie and how the whole family begins on an even steeper downward spiral due to a colossal misunderstanding thanks to Chris.Every character in the film is despicable in their own way either by the shameful atrocities they commit or just because of the fact that their motivation is hopelessly selfcentered and shockingly shallow and inept. Thankfully all these subhuman characters are played efficiently by firstrate performers. Emile Hirsch gives a convincing dignified performance in possibly one of the most confident screen roles in his adult life. Juno Temple comes off of Dirty Girl a wonderful coming of age drama to embody a wildly different yet extremely interesting character seemingly taken advantage of due to her intelligence or lack thereof. And Thomas Haden Church and Gina Gershon are consistently wonderful in their roles especially during the climatic half when they appear to be tested as actors all together. But the awardwinning performance here goes to McConaughey who is three for three this year with roles in Bernie another film looking to brew the idea of Texas noir and Magic Mike buoying him to an actor of near firstrate level. McConaughey's early career was plagued by a number of questionable romantic comedies and the occasional goofy action picture or two but this year we've seen nothing but him assuming roles of great confidence always possessing a firmly dignified slickness and swagger that sets him apart from other actors who have just started recognizing their potential. It would appear that McConaughey just woke up one day and realized that time was fleeting and his real acting career could begin. I never thought I'd say this but I couldn't see the role of Killer Joe being inhabited by anyone more quirky unsettling or thrilling as McConaughey.There's also something seriously notable about the tension director Friedkin whose most known work would be the iconic gamechanger The Exorcist erects during the entire course of Killer Joe. I began to notice it around twenty minutes in when I felt that I never officially held a comfortable position in my seat rearranging myself every few minutes. Then during the scene where Chris is desperately trying to outrun two goons on choppers taking backroads alleyways and literally anything that will get him off the track of the two bikers I became restless and enthralled. Killer Joe provides us with warm Texas sun and blends it elegantly with the raw thriller aspects found in a typical film noir picture. The entire climax taking place in the trailer of the Smith family is tense and unnerving. This is when I began to realize that this story had been a play prior to a film and that screenwriter Tracy Letts had adapted it so quaintly to film that the transformation was almost not noticeable even if it would've been it still wouldn't have been a thing to discourage. This is one of the first if not the first time I've watched a film that I didn't know was a play until later in the picture. The fact that this film confidently branches out so far past the idea of a stageplay to the point of being unrecognizable from its roots is a huge accomplishment all on its own.I close with a forewarning that while I feel that the NC17 rating Killer Joe received is somewhat questionable I state with caution that this is a very violent picture with several sequences of brutality that nearly channel the lines of sadistic depravity. Friedkin however is sure to capture it through a lens of style similar to how Rob Zombie beautifully captured the horrifying deeds of the three despicable murderers in The Devil's Rejects. The film's charm is indescribable and its execution fearless and zealous making this one of the most surprising and impressive motion pictures of this year.Starring Emile Hirsch Matthew McConaughey Thomas Haden Church Gina Gershon and Juno Temple.

After being refused money by his father Ansel Thomas Haden Church Chris comes up with a plot to have his mother murdered collecting the life insurance money that he believes will pass to his sister Dottie Juno Temple. To do the deed they hire police detective and parttime contract killer 'Killer' Joe Matthew McConaughey. Unable to pay his fees up front Joe decides to take Dottie as collateral who he asks to spend the night with until the debt is paid.Killer Joe's poster tagline reads 'A totally twisted deepfried Texas redneck trailer park murder story' and really that's precisely what it is. The central families sheer utter repulsiveness becomes the comedy vein that prevails throughout the plot as we are greeted by Sharla Gina Gershon Ansel's second wife opening her trailer door to reveal her hairy bush to a disgusted Chris. But Chris's loudmouthed ineptness Ansel's zombielike idiocy and Sharla's blatant maneating are neutralised by Juno Temple's strange quirky presence and her submissive relationship with Killer Joe that is as unsettling as it is oddly sweet. It's a quite amazing performance and her scenes with an almost equally impressive McConaughey provide the film's highlights.If the film has a definite strong point it is in the performances. While the aforementioned Temple and McConaughey will steal the plaudits Haden Church's dumb lurchlike performance reminds us why he was Oscar nominated for the sublime Sideways 2004 providing a sympathetic character amongst Chris's waster and Sharla's trailer trash whore. It's a shame that the plot can't match the performances and although the story takes a backseat to the mishmash of human monsters this really could have been a whole lot more. This is Coen Brothers territory taking place in that sweaty world of the Deep South full of smoky bars rusty trailers cowboy hats motorbikes and overweight middleaged men in vests a modernday noir world ripe with possibilities one that I feel has been slightly wasted here.But if you've ever wondered if a film's climatic scene would ever involved a woman performing fellatio on a chicken drumstick then here is your answer. Killer Joe's final frames will undoubtedly divide audiences between those who get director William Friedkin's intentions to take things to Jacobian absurdity to those who will feel it as a silly contradiction to the film early more subtle black humour. It's a splurge of extreme uncomfortable violence with a sprinkling of farce as the true psychological unbalance of Killer Joe becomes evident.

	schema:reviewBody "William Friedkin's career has been up and down most of his career I guess it's because he refuses to sellout and go commercial. His most 'Hollywood' film to date has been The Hunted from 2003 but even that was unusually muted for a film of that type.His latest effort is yet another adaptation of a Tracy Lett's play that's a male Tracy after Bug in 2006 and is choc full of warped inyourface sexuality bloody violence and humor so dark only the most depraved viewers will find funny. In fact it's more like a David Cronenberg film than Friedkin.If you've seen movies like The Acid House or the 1998 Todd Solondz facepunch Happiness and find them amusing through the gaps in your fingers then you'll be sick enough to fully enjoy Killer Joe.Matthew McConaughey plays Joe Cooper an unorthodox Dallas police detective who is 'hired' by petty drug dealer Emile Hirsch to whack his old lady and thus benefit from an insurance policy with his deadbeat dad Thomas Haden Church in a wonderful performance and virginal oddball sister Dottie Juno Temple. Only they cannot raise the money to pay Joe so he agrees to spend some quality time with Dottie until the policy pays off in waiver of his upfront fee.It reminded me a lot of an Oliver Stone film called UTurn another Texasbased psychosexual murder plot filled with heatwaves and perpetual distrust but was much more enjoyable. The perverse sexuality and dark humor really appeal to a mind like mine and McConaughey's performance atones for his crimes in various awful romcoms. Joe is a supremely weird but mesmerising character. You never really know what he's going to do next but you can still see the cogs turning as he evaluates every new plot twist. Plus it has fullfrontal nudity from Gina Gershon and Juno Temple which I absolutely do not disagree with.The film has been slapped with the dreaded NC17 in the US which massively limits the amount of theatres that will be showing it. But indirectly it will only turn it into a cult film and thus a bigger success with its intended audience than it otherwise might have been.I highly recommend that you a part of that audience it's as far from Hollywood as Friedkin has gotten since Cruising in 1980. Even at the age of 76 he's still on top form.Edit I just remembered that UTurn is actually set in Arizona.".

I won't give you any details on those activities because the less you know the better for everyone involved. Chris Hirsch is in debt bad. He owes the wrong people a ton of money and thinks the only way out is to kill his mother and collect the insurance money. He hires a man named Killer Joe McConaughey to take care of the job. When Chris can't come up with the money needed to hire him they work out a deal. Chris soon changes his mind. I am a McConaughey fan...yeah I said it. I'll deal with a shirt off scene in every movie because I like his style and his movies are entertaining. This one is no exception and may be my favorite role of his yet. He is so sadistic and evil in this but also keeps his charm so you don't fully hate him. He is both over the top and laid back. The movie itself is very very violent and bloody but I have to admit that I loved it. There is some humor in this and you laugh when you know you shouldn't but thats the sign of good humor. This is a movie that could have been one dimensional but with the cast and writing it really goes deeper and while not a movie that makes you think the whole time it does keep you guessing what will happen next. If you can handle this movie then I say watch it. I really liked it. Overall a very entertaining dark movie that I really liked but it not for everyone. I say A.".

He owes the wrong people a ton of money and thinks the only way out is to kill his mother and collect the insurance money. He hires a man named Killer Joe McConaughey to take care of the job. When Chris can't come up with the money needed to hire him they work out a deal. Chris soon changes his mind. I am a McConaughey fan...yeah I said it. I'll deal with a shirt off scene in every movie because I like his style and his movies are entertaining. This one is no exception and may be my favorite role of his yet. He is so sadistic and evil in this but also keeps his charm so you don't fully hate him. He is both over the top and laid back. The movie itself is very very violent and bloody but I have to admit that I loved it. There is some humor in this and you laugh when you know you shouldn't but thats the sign of good humor. This is a movie that could have been one dimensional but with the cast and writing it really goes deeper and while not a movie that makes you think the whole time it does keep you guessing what will happen next. If you can handle this movie then I say watch it. I really liked it. Overall a very entertaining dark movie that I really liked but it not for everyone. I say A.";

The movie itself has been said to be akin to Friedkin aping a Cohen crime caper and that description works. We have a crime masterminded by selfish unintelligent and or quirky characters we have the midwest as our backdrop and we have the metaphysical shadow of karma hovering over their every move throughout the film. Call it Cohen Brothers on whiskey. The characters themselves are all very stereotyped but I think Friedkin left that transparent enough. In other words the stereotype was part of the wardrobe itself. The reason being is this is not about these characters in particular...this is about choices and consequences and Killer Joe is simply a vehicle of karmic arithmetic. All that aside on any day or in any movie McConaughey's performance as Killer Joe is mesmerizing. He is the serpent...cold and dangerous but charming and in control constantly. He weaves his restrained psychotic energy through the movie as if he was born to play this role. For as silly as this movie can be this is a brutally adult movie. It is graphic and there is a barrel of bush in it. There is also an almost misogynistic undertone that I don't wish to defend one way or the other but I will say that for the scenes to not play out as they did would be an injustice to the character that McConaughey plays. The cast all around is very solid. Thomas Haden Church is pretty terrific Gershon is on point and I've never been happier to see her answer a door. Juno Temple is a lolitaish young vixen who seems to be almost in a different plane of existence throughout the movie. This is a movie that will stick with you after it's over the mark of a truly good movie. There's mechanics below the surface that have to be thought about and you have to discipline yourself for the eventual knee jerking that is bound to happen. Adults only. Would go well sandwiched between Blood Simple and No Country for Old Men.".

No character does what you think they will do no character really inspires you. The story made me feel disgusted and it left me with a little less hope in mankind The acting was decent.

I like violent movies. At some point I felt this movie tries to be like a Quentin Tarantino movie but still it's far from it. These characters are random. The atmosphere is easygoing and at times funny but compared to a Tarantino flick the dialog is that of stupid uninteresting people. You could argue that the point is to show how scared and not too bright people could react in a pressed situation. But is that really interesting enough to make into a film? Who would enjoy that? If you want to see senseless violence watch a horroraction movie and get your bloodlust satisfied. Watch a movie that does not try to be everything all at once but that fails to deliver anything worthwhile. Unless you are a psychopath then you will love this movie.".

	schema:headline " A pitchperfect black comedy and an ingenious social commentary. Everybody pays...";
	schema:reviewBody "Killer Joe by William Friedkin adapted almost slavishly from the play of the same name by Tracy Letts tells the story of the Smith family who pay a hitman to kill their matriarch for her life insurance policy. Matthew McConaughey is outstanding as the title character but the real star of this film... well I'll get to that shortly because it's not immediately apparent. This seems like just another genre film on the surface. Sunbleached buildings. Eyes hidden behind sunglasses and a cowboy hat. The confined space within a trailer. A murder plot gone awry doublecrossings twists all served up with fried chicken and potato salad. Stylistically this film is very good and it's got a great dark sense of humor throughout. But to see the real genius of this film you have to look a bit closer at the characters and the actions they make throughout the film. I see more layers every time I watch it and here are just a few of them.Killer Joe is a statement about American culture about the slow decay and splitting of the family unit the normalization of sex violence and apathy and the bastardization of traditions and values into something quite sinister. A can of pumpkin pie filling and a chicken leg are used as weapons at one point. Need I say more? This film literally takes the illusions of American life and smashes you in the face with them. Very modern art.SPOILERS The characters live in a world which is a bit exaggerated for effect but not unlike our own. They live in a society that forces every man to fend for himself. A dog eat dog world. Joe's rules cement this idea in their heads because if they don't do as he says and follow his rules he'll kill them. Or as he so impersonally tells them You will be killed. This is an important detail because it informs on the father and son psychologically that these rules are bigger than him and are therefore absolute. But not only do Ansel and Sharleen never try to stand up to Joe they treat him better than they do Chris Ansel's actual son. Why? Because he got involved with drugs and ended up owing money to drug dealers. So he gets what he deserves. That's the subliminal message that Joe's presence conveys. He is the law and the law punishes all for their transgressions. Everyone in this film gets exactly what they deserve in the end with no room for forgiveness or compassion. Chris's attempt to rescue Dottie is the closest they ever come to breaking the rules and acting out of love instead of logic. But it's also hinted at that his love for Dottie is impure and driven by incest.My favorite character in this film by far is Ansel portrayed perfectly and hilariously by Thomas Haden Church. He's like a shaved ape a deevolution of 20th century man. He's always apathetic watching TV and drinking beer. He lives in his own little world and lets things deteriorate around him. The play features a fallen tree crushing part of that trailer's roof that he does nothing about. When his wife Sharleen is being degraded horribly he never stands up for her because she cheated on him she broke the rules of their relationship so she deserves what happens to her in his eyes. Even when Joe gives them a moment by themselves he simply stands behind her and asks her with tears in his eyes Are you okay? Okay. He's always impotent despite his large stature and in my mind Ansel is the real main character of this film because at any point he could have stopped Joe and accepted the consequences but he didn't and in the end becomes so tamed and docile that he begs Joe to kill his son. An analogy of sending young men to die in wars? That moment is so crazy that it really shows that the whole theme of the movie really revolves around him. Like a trained dog he's brainwashed into believing he has no choice in the awful decisions he makes throughout the film. Joe represents the culture of fear that pushes rational people to make irrational choices and Ansel is a perfect pawn for his system of intimidation and control. For more on Ansel search up a good essay by Ronald William Smith who portrayed him on stage.There's two interesting monologues in this film that give additional thematic clues. Chris's story about the rabbits that went rabid and Joe's story about the river slowly being lost to Oklahoma. Both reflect Joe's changing presence throughout the film from a stranger to being welcomed into the trailer like a family member. He's in his room says Ansel at one point. He also just walks around naked without anyone saying a word about it. He's like a charming cancer cell he infects and then he spreads deeper and deeper creating chaos like the rabies did to the rabbits until they tore each other apart. Joe's character is a symbol of corruption sex and violence under a guise of order. Letts is trying to say that American households literally invite this sex and violence in and make it a normal part of their lives. Whether or not you agree with his point of view this is a scathing whitehot indictment of modern day American family life that pulls absolutely no punches and tears back the curtain of Western culture in a way not seen since David Lynch's Blue Velvet.In the end Dottie has the gun on Joe. Does she pull the trigger? Is their love really pure? What fate does Joe deserve? Is he truly a monster or is he just a mirror reflecting the chaos of the family back at them? Maybe the cancer of their lives was always there and Joe is simply the catalyst that sets it loose. I also wonder if she planned all along for Chris and Ansel to screw up their plot and remove themselves from her life. Maybe that's why she encouraged them. This is definitely one of my favorite films of 2012.".

	schema:headline " Did that just happen???";
	schema:reviewBody "Welcome back William Friedkin of The Exorcist French Connection and To Live and Die in LA... where the hell have you been? It's no secret I suppose that Friedkin as great as he always was is one of the laziest directors of all time. Not that he makes bad films. Clearly I'm not saying that at all. I really appreciated his older brutal gritty crime dramas and such. But he never made anywhere near as many films as he should have and that man could have belted out as many classics as Kubrick had he cared! Killer Joe marks his return to the director's chair and it's one of the few returns I've anticipated the most in recent times along with the return of Walter Hill.Killer Joe was a hell of a gamble for Friedkin for a number of reasons besides the fact that it was a film he knew the mainstream would absolutely not be interested in.For a start the movie is white trash Texas AND based on a theatre play. That spells arthouse something Friedkin fans might never associate him with. But even stranger it spells very offensive arthouse that isn't looking to make friends with Texas.Secondly the majority of the cast are either taken with a pinch of salt or settled into character roles that their fans would't feel comfortable seeing them in. Let's get that particular ball rolling shall we? Emile Hirsch who I don't like plays Chris Smith an annoying horrid trailer trash drug abusing dead end kid who wants to have his own mother murdered so he can inherit her will. He's in trouble and owes money. Not having the money could mean paralysis or death in the near future.Getting his dad and stepmother involved in a plot to have a hitman murder his mother also the mother of Dottie Chris's braindamaged younger sister who has been wrong ever since their mother tried to smother her and played to alarming accuracy by Juno Temple.In comes cold and somewhat calmly deranged 'Killer' Joe Cooper a cop that murders people on the side as a second job. He will take the job and wait for Mrs Smith's will to be cashed so long as he can have Dottie as a retainer meaning that he will do with her whatever he damn well pleases.As events unfold everything goes to plan but Chris becomes increasingly irrational and untrustworthy as does his stepmother the awesome Gina Gershon. Sensing everything falling down around him Killer Joe remains in cop mode and finds himself at the centre of a bigger conspiracy.It's not so much the plot that's different here it's McConnaughey as Killer Joe. I've not found him in many enjoyable roles since Dazed and Confused or Reign of Fire but here he delivers one of the most extremely charismatic yet psychopathic roles I have ever witnessed and this film is disturbing to its very core.The odd thing is that as disturbing as it is you're either going to switch off out of disgust for what happens or the things your eyes will catch  as Friedkin is not one to hold back or be told he's out of order  and if you keep watching you may very well laugh and find yourself extremely satisfied with the outcome.Killer Joe is about despicable people and not one of the characters are likable but saying that you do often pity Chris's honest but simple and burdened father Ansel Thomas Hayden Church in possibly his best to date and Dottie who can't help but be Dottie whatever the situation.This could very well have been a Gary Oldman film were it British which is also why I appreciate it so much. It has no shortage of guts and is so willing to offend the narrow minded that it pleases me to no end.I dare to suggest boyfriend and girlfriend watch this on a cosy night in. If not it's one for the boys to watch with a beer!".

It's no secret I suppose that Friedkin as great as he always was is one of the laziest directors of all time. Not that he makes bad films. Clearly I'm not saying that at all. I really appreciated his older brutal gritty crime dramas and such. But he never made anywhere near as many films as he should have and that man could have belted out as many classics as Kubrick had he cared! Killer Joe marks his return to the director's chair and it's one of the few returns I've anticipated the most in recent times along with the return of Walter Hill.Killer Joe was a hell of a gamble for Friedkin for a number of reasons besides the fact that it was a film he knew the mainstream would absolutely not be interested in.For a start the movie is white trash Texas AND based on a theatre play. That spells arthouse something Friedkin fans might never associate him with. But even stranger it spells very offensive arthouse that isn't looking to make friends with Texas.Secondly the majority of the cast are either taken with a pinch of salt or settled into character roles that their fans would't feel comfortable seeing them in. Let's get that particular ball rolling shall we? Emile Hirsch who I don't like plays Chris Smith an annoying horrid trailer trash drug abusing dead end kid who wants to have his own mother murdered so he can inherit her will. He's in trouble and owes money. Not having the money could mean paralysis or death in the near future.Getting his dad and stepmother involved in a plot to have a hitman murder his mother also the mother of Dottie Chris's braindamaged younger sister who has been wrong ever since their mother tried to smother her and played to alarming accuracy by Juno Temple.In comes cold and somewhat calmly deranged 'Killer' Joe Cooper a cop that murders people on the side as a second job. He will take the job and wait for Mrs Smith's will to be cashed so long as he can have Dottie as a retainer meaning that he will do with her whatever he damn well pleases.As events unfold everything goes to plan but Chris becomes increasingly irrational and untrustworthy as does his stepmother the awesome Gina Gershon. Sensing everything falling down around him Killer Joe remains in cop mode and finds himself at the centre of a bigger conspiracy.It's not so much the plot that's different here it's McConnaughey as Killer Joe. I've not found him in many enjoyable roles since Dazed and Confused or Reign of Fire but here he delivers one of the most extremely charismatic yet psychopathic roles I have ever witnessed and this film is disturbing to its very core.The odd thing is that as disturbing as it is you're either going to switch off out of disgust for what happens or the things your eyes will catch  as Friedkin is not one to hold back or be told he's out of order  and if you keep watching you may very well laugh and find yourself extremely satisfied with the outcome.Killer Joe is about despicable people and not one of the characters are likable but saying that you do often pity Chris's honest but simple and burdened father Ansel Thomas Hayden Church in possibly his best to date and Dottie who can't help but be Dottie whatever the situation.This could very well have been a Gary Oldman film were it British which is also why I appreciate it so much. It has no shortage of guts and is so willing to offend the narrow minded that it pleases me to no end.I dare to suggest boyfriend and girlfriend watch this on a cosy night in. If not it's one for the boys to watch with a beer!";

Chris Smith Emile Hirsh has got himself in trouble with the underworld if he doesn't produce some cash he's a dead man. He reasons with his father Ansel Thomas Haden Church that everyone would be happier if his mother Adele was killed as she has a 50000 life insurance policy. Considering Adele is his wretched exwife he agrees as does his girlfriend Sharla Gina Gershon and teenage daughter Dottie Juno Temple. Although Chris doesn't have the money up front Killer Joe a Dallas police officer who moonlights as a contract killer accepts the job on the condition that Dottie serves as sexual collateral.'Killer Joe' is a fantastic thriller with a warped tension that you don't encounter that often. This film confirms that Matthew McConaughey is on a rapid upward trajectory he gives an intense performance that's utterly steeped in menace. Though 'Killer' Joe Cooper remains largely restrained and ambiguous throughout the film each syllable of his southern drawl is loaded with a palpable danger. His performance is captivating it creates a pervasive looming sense of dread and depravity that suggests something very bad is going to happen at any moment.The praise doesn't stop with McConaughey the whole cast delivers to the best of their ability it really is an actors' film. If I hadn't researched her I would have assumed on the credibility of her southern accent that the British Juno Temple was a Texas native. She shows good dramatic range as Dottie the slightly strange childlike girl at the centre of the film.William Friedkin has outdone himself with his second collaboration with writer Tracy Letts he directs the taut punchy material perfectly. What's most refreshing is that 77yearold Friedkin was bold enough to release it uncut with the dreaded NC17 certificate he wasn't going to allow himself to sell out.Seeing as the film's source material is a stage play it isn't a film of many sets it seldom leaves the confines of the Smith family's trashy trailer. Much like their first collaboration 'Bug' 'Killer Joe' delivers biting tension and a maelstrom of chaos in a cramped domestic setting.I can honestly compliment every area of this film. Tyler Bates' score is brilliantly suspenseful especially when it introduces Killer Joe it further adds to his aura of danger. The film is also beautifully shot it's stunning in high definition.Despite the menace and darkness of it all the film is laced with deadpan humour especially in the film's final quarter the demented absurdity of which leaves you wondering what the hell just happened!www.hawkensian.com".

Could this be a fresh take on a journey through admittedly familiar territory with some neat new twists? Sadly the answer is no. My overall reaction is disappointment  not 118 minutes completely wasted but I'm left with the feeling that it should have delivered more.I can't accept that William Friedkin has outdone David Lynch in creating a movie that challenges the audience with its dark humour offbeat insights and shock value. This film is strangely predictable despite the unresolved ending. Killer Joe ramps up the sex violence and quirkiness but the story is the critical factor. Set in Dallas Chris Smith a deeply in debt drug dealer played by Emile Hirsch lives with his father Ansel Thomas Haden Church his stepmother Sharla Gina Gershon and his sister Dottie played by Juno Temple. Other than Dottie the Smith's are an obnoxious bunch. Chris convinces the others to have his mother Ansel's exwife murdered by a hired killer in order to collect the insurance money. The killer they hire is Joe Cooper played by Matthew McConaughey. He agrees to do it for a fee but as a retainer Joe demands an affair with Dottie. Joe is psychotic and violent. He eventually honours his part of the deal but Chris and Ansel don't get the insurance money and can't pay Joe his fee. Joe eventually tears the family apart not only through his relationship with Dottie but also by exposing Sharla's deceit. All the protagonists come together in a violent finale but with nowhere else to go the film opts for an odd but hardly satisfying ending. Killer Joe is not a celebration of life  dark Gothic humour maybe but I think it falls flat under all the violence. Without the violence we are left with a slight story that smacks of things we've seen before. Not only that but the two scenes of prolonged brutality one where Sharla is humiliated with a piece of KFC and the other when Joe pounds Chris's face with a can of pumpkin seem to be inspired by Irreversible the French film that also plumbed the lower depths. As I watched those scenes in Killer Joe I couldn't help thinking that someone had taken notes in that earlier far bleaker movie.The film just isn't as clever as it thinks it is. The actors are fine Matthew McConaughey disturbs and menaces it's the concept that's flawed. Violence at this level will always get attention  as do road rage videos on YouTube  but I think this story is as shallow as the characters it creates. We deserve more of a reward for staying the course  Joe doesn't get a payoff but either do we.".

My all time favourite film is The Exorcist and any other film I see from him gets me slightly worried because I know he has a pretty sketchy body of work.So I saw the obvious other Friedkin choice and that was The French Connection which I thought was really good. I saw his first play adaptation Bug which I thought was pretty special and I started to realise how much he pushes the performances of the actors and this is clearly his priority over any other aspect of film making. Yes it has to be visually appealing but the subject matter of his work is always reliant on performances.So Killer Joe is another adaptation of a play by Tracy Letts and again has to rely on strong characters with convincing effort to make it come to life. Thankfully Killer Joe delivers on this. In fact if it wasn't for William Friedkin's ability to add extreme pressure onto the actors by limiting the shooting to two takes per scene I honestly think it would have lost it's attraction pretty quickly.The film takes you into the bowels of lowlife Texas and really emphasizes the grim reality of life for some unfortunate families. It was surprising to discover a black comedy breeze come over the film and it did come at you pretty surprisingly especially scenes including Thomas HadenChurch. The cinematography improved on that point by having close up shots of Joe Cooper preparing himself for his first onscreen appearance to the world and blasting mere seconds of TV trash full screen to the audience to make a clear point on rednecks having a low attention span. All of this made me chuckle but it still kept me interested by providing a simple enough plot and letting the great performances carry it along.Of course there has been a lot of talk regarding the late scenes of the film. Joe's well spoken manner and calm demeanour are pushed to the edge and his rage is unleashed like a shaken coke can that's been opened up. It came as a real shock to me and the suspense was unbearable enough to make your heart pound. Whichever way it makes you feel at the end I'm sure you would leave the characters behind knowing it's ended in a really good way and is sure to be discussed well after the credits.All in all it's a good piece of work. The effort from the actors far outweigh the visuals which is perfectly fine for a story like this. I'm pretty sure Killer Joe is going to be a reasonable success at the box office and will certainly grab a lot attention when the eventual DVD release comes our way.".

	schema:reviewBody "If there is one good thing to come out of a vulgar for vulgarities sake film such as Killer Joe it is that hopefully this will put an end to the Tracy Letts experiment. In yet another film from the dreadful collaboration of director William Friedkin The Exorcist and playwright Tracy Letts Bug Killer Joe is a star studded putrid mess of a film starring Matthew McConaughey The Lincoln Lawyer Emile Hirsch Into the Wild Juno Temple The Dark Knight RisesThomas Haden Church Sideways and Gina Gershon FaceOff. I for one didn't think it could get any worse than 2006's Bug but what Bug was to a boringnonsensicalacid trip Killer Joe is to shockcentric style filmmaking with sequences of brutality and misogyny lifted onto a pedestal coinciding with headscratchingly elongated scenes of zero substance. What Friedkin and Letts have created with Killer Joe is a film that does what it wants when it wants to at the expense of its audience. Let me give you an example of what I mean If Friedkin wants to show a vagina it doesn't seem to matter what the mood of the film is or what may be gained or lost by bringing the film to a screeching halt to show said vagina Friedkin is getting his vagina close up. Furthermore if Letts wants to write a twenty minute interrogation scene that meanders for nineteen of those minutes it is happening whether you like it or not. It's these woeful filmmaking decisions among many others I'm specifically talking about the disturbingly absurd fried chicken scene which everyone planning to see this film has probably heard about by now that absolutely ruined any chance for Killer Joe as a watchable film. In short This is a film that doesn't straddle the border of clever and absurd but pretty much trashes the clever and embraces the absurd resulting in something that becomes far too strange for comfort.Side Note Those who loved Killer Joe probably love the work of David Lynch as well the reason being that Killer Joe falls into the same experimental column as your common Lynch film. Killer Joe is filled FILLED with scenes that make little sense or if they do will have audiences wondering what they have just watched. So just like any Lynch film no matter how absurd the visuals or the dialogue many critics will proclaim Killer Joe brilliant making claims that there is something deeper at work here than there actually is. Let me assure you there is nothing more to this film than the deplorable trash that is on the screen.The Lett's Problem As with Lett's last casual adaptation the aforementioned Bug the dialogue in this FILM sounds like the dialogue of a PLAY wherein all of the conversations are nonthematically drawnout to the point where much of it seemed either forced and or becomes boring and I am not saying Plays are boring. The overall pacing of this film is also hindered by the playlike script with scenes which are prolonged to the point of exhaustion.With all that said there is an actual storyline here. The plot follows a young man played by Hirsch who is deep in debt with some very bad people and decides with the help of his father Church sister Temple and his stepmother Gershon to hire a hitman by the name of Killer Joe Cooper to kill his mother so he can collect the insurance money. And if that was all this story would have been about this may have been a half way decent film. Instead audiences are bombarded with mounds of disturbing visuals treated in a flippant manner editing which is all over the place nonsensical nudity numbing violence acting that is so overthetop it is uncomfortable to watch and an entire plot that is drowned beneath a dark comedic atmosphere that basically confuses audiences to the point of repulsion quickly bypassing annoyance.Matthew McConaughey's Performance Before watching this film I had heard an interview with McConaughey stating how the first time he read this script he turned it down simply on the basis that he thought it was an all around ugly piece of work. Well needless to say because I've already said it his first instincts were right on the money. And this is a very interesting point because aside from Gershon who is the best thing in this film McConaughey not only comes through with another stand out performance following his work in Magic Mike but also one of the best performances of his career no matter how offputting it may be. It is just a shame that the best part of this career altering performance lies in the final vomit inducing thirty minutes. A final thirty minutes that not only voids anything good about this film the little that there is but more importantly may unfortunately be the reason McConaughey will be overlooked come awards season.Final Thought All you really need to know about Killer Joe is that this is yet another FriedkinLetts collaboration that's sole purpose is to elicit a visceral response not to tell a coherent story. True some audiences may laugh some may be repulsed as I was some may say they enjoyed themselves and secretly were repulsed and some may have acted liked they wanted to puke and secretly enjoyed themselves but at the end of it all the storyline is so muddied by Letts and Friedkin's own form of visually explicit big screen self gratification that nobody in the audience will care about any kind of halfwit plot that Letts is attempting to construct. So all things considered and throwing in the most vile scene I have seen in any film since The Human Centipede 2 I cannot in good consciousness recommend Killer Joe to anyone especially if you are planning on going to KFC anytime soon.Follow me on Twitter moviesmarkus".

	onyx:emotionText "If there is one good thing to come out of a vulgar for vulgarities sake film such as Killer Joe it is that hopefully this will put an end to the Tracy Letts experiment. In yet another film from the dreadful collaboration of director William Friedkin The Exorcist and playwright Tracy Letts Bug Killer Joe is a star studded putrid mess of a film starring Matthew McConaughey The Lincoln Lawyer Emile Hirsch Into the Wild Juno Temple The Dark Knight RisesThomas Haden Church Sideways and Gina Gershon FaceOff. I for one didn't think it could get any worse than 2006's Bug but what Bug was to a boringnonsensicalacid trip Killer Joe is to shockcentric style filmmaking with sequences of brutality and misogyny lifted onto a pedestal coinciding with headscratchingly elongated scenes of zero substance.

On my last day however I saw Killer Joe. Um. It is very very very very difficult to write about this film. What I can say first of all and with confidence is that it absolutely blew away anything else I saw at that festival and pretty much anything I have seen by Friedkin or anybody from his generation for a long time Bug was a good primer for this.. Though a little under the radar I found it really impressive.. So for those of you who have seen it it's worth mentioning that he is collaborating with the same writer here Tracy Letts. A few days before I had seen the new Coppola film called 'Twixt' and while I was impressed visually with his film I couldn't shake the feeling that he had somehow lost 'it' that elusive ability to make a gripping and tight narrative picture that so captivates your attention that you forget you are watching a film and just sit back and take it. Killer Joe resets the bar for me  I had almost forgotten about the sheer power of film  to not only captivate you and enthrall you into its trance but also its ability to shock you into a catatonic submission. You see actors that are familiar  Emile Hirsch Gina Gershon Matthew McConoughey Thomas Haden Church... But no there is nobody to recognize here. They are all so hidden underneath their personas and so real and bloodied by their characters that not a moment passes that you question who they are. They simply are these characters and after watching it you cannot imagine anybody else cast in any of these roles. And I will add that I never in a million years thought that I would consider Matthew McConoughey perfect for ANY role  though weirdly he might have found the role of his life in Joe. The man is absolutely genius in this film. Dark sadistic calm precise.. Perfect.I am reticent to write more details  I only urge you to see it. That said  it is not for everybody as evidenced by the massive walkout in the theater during the last twenty or so minutes of the screening. You will need the stomach for a film of this nature. I hate to compare but you might consider it an xrated Coen brothers film hopped up on steroids. Overall it's mercifully hilarious  brilliantly written with a sly wit about it which blunts out a lot of the violence to where the final haunting scenes provoked twisted and maniacal laughs from audience members rather than shocked silence which would have been the only other reasonable response to a story such as this.So. There you have it my rather cryptic review of a film that took me out of my seat and blew me the hell away. Peace out Friedkin I'm a major fan again.".

The story line is believable if you believe that trailer trash is a viable group of low life's who inhabit Texas trailer courts. People abusing beating and killing each other and sex involving chicken parts really pushed it over the edge.

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't read the book by Jeff Kinney which this film is based upon but one thought struck my mind and that is Ferris Bueller just got younger! For all his wisecracks smart alecky ideas and attitude Greg Heffley Zachary Gordon just reminds me of the time when Matthew Broderick took on the Bueller role though this time round it's got less to do with cars and girls but everything to do about surviving middle school just about the time before puberty kicks in for him.No thanks to the 101 tactical lessons on middle school survival by his brother Rodrick Devon Bostick Greg decides that his goal and calling during his time will be to be Mr Popular though he increasingly finds that task being close to impossible given the number of his schemes backfiring most of the time and when his best friend Rowley Robert Capron continues to be the source of embarrassment to his perceived supercool demeanour. He tries to rewrite the school's playground rules only to find that he isn't quite the trend setter or the visionary he thinks he is while his plus sized friend somehow manages to climb up the popularity rankings.It's about that time in our lives where we think we're able to change the world from a very young age where we think we're infallible and that whatever we do we can reset the established norm. It's about how negative emotions such as jealousy and envy get the better of us sometimes and we react in the nastiest of ways due to pride. Then there's the message of being true to oneself rather than the actor being someone else. Relatively heavy themes for what's essentially a kids' film but that's how director Thor Freudenthal managed to include in the tale of the wimpy kid's first year in middle school without you feeling overwhelmed but them.What works here wonderfully is the casting which is probably just about the highlight of the film itself. Zachary Gordon owns the role as Greg and has this schmuck look on him that doesn't irritate but will buy you into his exploits and most times laugh along or at him depending on whether his antics will rub you the right way or not. And nearly stealing the limelight away from Greg is his best friend Rowley played to wingman perfection by Robert Capron who like his character is always on the verge of upstaging Zachary Gordon and stealing his thunder. The two are believable as best friends forever in Harry PotterRon Weasley proportions and it is their play against each other one using the other to further his cause the other just happy to have someone whom he can try to emulate being the strong points in the narrative. Their acting's natural and have incredible chemistry so much so that you wonder if everything will go downhill when they split.The humour in the film is manifold from pure wit right down to the occasional toilet humour with farts pee and all from the home to outside of home and the usual challenges faced when in battlezones such as the canteen the gym and festivals like Halloween and even MotherChild Night?! The basic animation featured in the film also boosted its narrative through its simple iconic drawings and provides very much on how Greg sees himself and that of his friends and family which no doubt had tinges of familiarity and being stereotypes such as the nasty big sized girl whose influential family means she can act like a bitch or that nerd outcast that everyone tries to avoid. Plot elements such as the rotting piece of cheese stuck on the school grounds also provide for plenty of inane moments and Cheese Touch is something that I'll never forget.Diary of a Wimpy Kid is loads of fun being reminiscent of the time when growing up was quite the pain and more often than not a time of being misunderstood. Highly recommended!".

	onyx:emotionText "I haven't read the book by Jeff Kinney which this film is based upon but one thought struck my mind and that is Ferris Bueller just got younger! For all his wisecracks smart alecky ideas and attitude Greg Heffley Zachary Gordon just reminds me of the time when Matthew Broderick took on the Bueller role though this time round it's got less to do with cars and girls but everything to do about surviving middle school just about the time before puberty kicks in for him.No thanks to the 101 tactical lessons on middle school survival by his brother Rodrick Devon Bostick Greg decides that his goal and calling during his time will be to be Mr Popular though he increasingly finds that task being close to impossible given the number of his schemes backfiring most of the time and when his best friend Rowley Robert Capron continues to be the source of embarrassment to his perceived supercool demeanour. He tries to rewrite the school's playground rules only to find that he isn't quite the trend setter or the visionary he thinks he is while his plus sized friend somehow manages to climb up the popularity rankings.It's about that time in our lives where we think we're able to change the world from a very young age where we think we're infallible and that whatever we do we can reset the established norm. It's about how negative emotions such as jealousy and envy get the better of us sometimes and we react in the nastiest of ways due to pride. Then there's the message of being true to oneself rather than the actor being someone else. Relatively heavy themes for what's essentially a kids' film but that's how director Thor Freudenthal managed to include in the tale of the wimpy kid's first year in middle school without you feeling overwhelmed but them.What works here wonderfully is the casting which is probably just about the highlight of the film itself. Zachary Gordon owns the role as Greg and has this schmuck look on him that doesn't irritate but will buy you into his exploits and most times laugh along or at him depending on whether his antics will rub you the right way or not. And nearly stealing the limelight away from Greg is his best friend Rowley played to wingman perfection by Robert Capron who like his character is always on the verge of upstaging Zachary Gordon and stealing his thunder.

	schema:reviewBody "We went to see the Diary of a Wimpy Kid Movie this past week with a number of adults and kids and I have to say that everyone absolutely loved this movie. There is something for everyone to relate to in this movie young or old. It stays true to the book which was a concern all of us had before seeing the movie. However you don't have to read the book to enjoy this movie. In addition the adaptation from the book to silver screen was one of the better ones I have seen and the transformation captured the essence of the story intact. There were a few additional scenes added to the movie that weren't in the book but they kept in step with the story and didn't detract at all from the enjoyment of the film.The cast was all well picked. The main character of the movie Greg Heffley played wonderfully by Zachary Gordon stayed true to the book and he was totally believable. Everyone felt that this kid actor Zach Gordon did a great job of bringing life to this complex character and transforming Greg Heffley from a cartoon stick figure in the books to a real live person while maintaining all his idiosyncrasies. It was also fun to watch him as at times he has these great facial expressions. The beauty of the movie was the added sensitivity and emotionality that presented itself in the film that wasn't available to us in the novel.In the movie Greg led us on an emotional rollercoaster ride throughout the film first we liked him then we hated him then we felt sorry for him then we loved him. His relationship with his best friend Rowley along with its ups and downs hey just like real life was great for kids to see. For adults it would remind us of the real friendships we had from simpler times in those early Jr. High School years. Before computers we had real live friendships and we really did go over to our friends' houses to play.I did not find the movie trite predictable or slow. The comedy was evenly paced and kept the attention of the audience throughout including my kids. This is a very entertaining movie that can be enjoyed by adults as well as kids. If you want a fun witty wholesome and relatable story that will both touch and entertain you at the same time go see this movie it won't disappoint.".

The leading stars were very likable as I was smiling basically the entire time. It was a rather short movie but enjoyable that goes through one full school year showing how tough it is for this one individual and how hard he tries to become popular. The main character Greg Kind of comes off as a rude and full of himself pre teen student as he tries to change his bestfriend who is a little chubby and a funny red hair goofball. He becomes more popular after a certain incident which causes an argument between the two childhood bestfriends. Overall It was enjoyable for the whole family including adults teenagers and of course the children. There was no cursing or sexual content which was pleasant in this movie. The parents are likable as well as they are actually suportive unlike other movies but the older brother is of course an annoying punk rock wannabe who picks on the younger brother which gets old quickly. In the end I was happy i went to go see it but not to sure if I recommend it but definitely if you or your children has read the books. Its not bad but not the best book to movie series or children's movie either.".

There is this funny moment wherein whoever touches the piece of stale cheese is considered to have THE CHEESE TOUCH. Whoever touches that person takes with himself the cheese touch.Even a cockroach was concerned about its dignity. No matter how hard he tries he always gets branded every now and then as the douche.Eventually however Greg learns that it really doesn't matter if one is on the top of the popularity list in the school but what matters the most is being on the top of the list of your best friends. A little act of genius and sacrifice vindicates him eventually. I found the movie totally enjoyable as guys we were kids once remember after all ! We used to consider some little and petty things as important didn't we ? The sequel to the movie  Diary of a Wimpy Kid 2 Rodrick Rules is set to hit the theaters in March 2011 and I'm looking forward to it as well. The movie was really cute and I wish everyone watches it although I'll give it a 6 as it wasn't excellent though but the movie is highly recommended if you want to relive a part of your past.".

I also have seen some of the worst films ever like Star Worms 2 Monster A GoGo and Night of the Lepus. When I heard hey were making a DOAWK movie I thought it would be fun! Boy was I wrong! This is one of the unfunniest films ever! Not sure if this is worse than Vampires Suck but it makes Disaster Movie look like Airplane. While this film follows the books it feels entirely different. While the books gave a funny story that 13 and 14 year old's can relate to this film only serves to exploit middle school like 70's blaxploitation movies did to blacks.Why does every character look like a 7 year old? Ansewer So they could get younger kids into the theater while still using the title to pander to young teens. I was offended by the way they portray middle school! The Cheese Touch? Kids at my school play similar games note that those kids are in 2nd Grade! And even they don't break friendships over that stupid game! The whole film is about the main character whoWill do anything to be famous! I assume that that is the only reason he took this role. This kid is so clearly without talent that I cringe at all the lines he has here! If real kids acted like that the suicide rate int his country alone would go up by at least 60! And there is no suspense or drama throughout the whole movie. I don't want to give away spoilers but lets just say nothing is resolved clearly hoping for a sequel or 7!

I also have seen some of the worst films ever like Star Worms 2 Monster A GoGo and Night of the Lepus. When I heard hey were making a DOAWK movie I thought it would be fun! Boy was I wrong! This is one of the unfunniest films ever! Not sure if this is worse than Vampires Suck but it makes Disaster Movie look like Airplane. While this film follows the books it feels entirely different. While the books gave a funny story that 13 and 14 year old's can relate to this film only serves to exploit middle school like 70's blaxploitation movies did to blacks.Why does every character look like a 7 year old? Ansewer So they could get younger kids into the theater while still using the title to pander to young teens. I was offended by the way they portray middle school! The Cheese Touch? Kids at my school play similar games note that those kids are in 2nd Grade! And even they don't break friendships over that stupid game! The whole film is about the main character whoWill do anything to be famous! I assume that that is the only reason he took this role. This kid is so clearly without talent that I cringe at all the lines he has here! If real kids acted like that the suicide rate int his country alone would go up by at least 60! And there is no suspense or drama throughout the whole movie. I don't want to give away spoilers but lets just say nothing is resolved clearly hoping for a sequel or 7! In conclusion do not fall for this films tricky marketing. You will only be disappointed! One star.";

Chloe Moretz and Steve Zahn round out the cast that shows the ups and downs of a boy and his best friend as they journey into middle school for the first time. Apparently there is a sequel in the works for the second book in the series due out in 2011. Needless to say my son is highly anticipating seeing that one as well. I thought it was a cute movie although more for his age group. In fact it was enjoyable and find the more stuff on his level i am watching lately i am enjoying more then the garbage that Hollywwod is putting out how sad is that?".

The brother was supposed to be a badass rocker but he couldn't pull of the attitude or the outfit. The events that happened weren't funny and usually stuff you've seen 10 times better in other movies.I can't believe all these semipositive reviews seems like they were created by the people who made this movie so I'm trying to warn you if you have a choice in it don't be stupid and choose this movie it's a terrible waste of time.".

	schema:headline " Terrible!!";
	schema:reviewBody "First and foremost the only reason I watched this horrible movie is because it has Chloe Moretz My favorite actress in the entire world in it. If she wasn't in it I would have avoided this movie completely. Basically this movie is about a whiny kid named Greg that is starting middle school but acts like he is 4 years old. He has one best friend named Rowley who acts like he is even younger than Greg. The whole movie is based on Greg trying to get popular at what looks like the worst school on the planet Rowley however doesn't worry so much about it which makes them kind of opposites. I am so offended at how school is portrayed in movies and TV shows as being such a hellhole. There were bullies at every turn teachers that pick on students Greg and Rowley getting into trouble for no reason at all Middle school was nothing like that when I went. I tried to be open minded about this movie but it really let me down. I kept waiting for it to get better. Never did! The only good parts of the movie were the ones that had Chloe Moretz in them as for the rest of the movie I will spend the rest of my life trying to forget it. Thank God Chloe wasn't in the sequels she can do so much better! Do yourself a favor stay away from this awful movie!!".

	onyx:emotionText "First and foremost the only reason I watched this horrible movie is because it has Chloe Moretz My favorite actress in the entire world in it. If she wasn't in it I would have avoided this movie completely. Basically this movie is about a whiny kid named Greg that is starting middle school but acts like he is 4 years old. He has one best friend named Rowley who acts like he is even younger than Greg. The whole movie is based on Greg trying to get popular at what looks like the worst school on the planet Rowley however doesn't worry so much about it which makes them kind of opposites. I am so offended at how school is portrayed in movies and TV shows as being such a hellhole. There were bullies at every turn teachers that pick on students Greg and Rowley getting into trouble for no reason at all Middle school was nothing like that when I went. I tried to be open minded about this movie but it really let me down. I kept waiting for it to get better. Never did! The only good parts of the movie were the ones that had Chloe Moretz in them as for the rest of the movie I will spend the rest of my life trying to forget it.

When he started wearing eyeliner his apathetic parents didn't even seem to be in the least bit concerned that their son just might be transforming into their daughter.Here are some of the messages that this film sent out to me  Having a good solid rapport with your parents is completely unimportant.If you're a parent it's OK to totally humiliate your kids in front of their friends as Mrs. Heffley did with Rodrick when confronting him about his girlie magazines.It's good to take out revenge on others. And always make sure to hit back twice as hard when you do.When choosing friends always pick ones who are clearly less attractive andor intelligent than yourself. This makes you appear to be so much more appealing in the eyes of others.Love thy gym teacher even though this lardassed jerk with lovehandles is a terrible role model and a hypocrite when it comes to the likes of physical fitness.This movie repeatedly drove home the message that middleschool students have nothing but hatred and resentment for one another. And when it comes to vicious bullying girls are just as horrible and nasty as boys. In fact they are sometimes even worse bullies One of the most alarming statements made in this film was about how widespread cruelty and hatred was even amongst the younger children of today.I thought that the snotnosed Zachary Gordon made for a terrible Wimpy Kid character aka. Greg Heffley. He was totally miscast for the part.I absolutely despised the Greg Heffley character. I found him to be just as much of an obnoxious monster as the people he so sneeringly pointed out as being beneath himself the morons.For a 10 yearold kid Greg's bitter cynicism was unbelievably appalling. At the pessimistic rate that he was going what was this arrogant little brat gonna be like 10 years down the road? And finally  I found this whole frickin' business about the slice of rotten moldy cheese sitting out on the outdoor basketball court to be taken way too far. It was humorous once but after that it was a bore. Why had this cheese slice been sitting out there in the same spot for so long? Like didn't this school have a janitor who took care of cleaning up litter etc. on the grounds outside of the building as well? P.S.  If this film had been turned into a featurelength animated production using the goofy cartoon stickfigure people as its characters then I'm sure that it would've been so much more entertaining to watch. This sort of approach would have worked so much better certainly to its advantage in the long run.".

	schema:headline " Flowers in The Dust  the story of a woman the story of a child...";
	schema:reviewBody "'Dhool Ka Phool' Yash Chopra's amazing directorial debut is a classic of classics. The film is about the social norms of those times showing their effect on people of that time. This is the story of Meena Mala Sinha a young and orphaned woman who lives with her aunt and uncle. Meena meets Mahesh and the two fall in love. However when she finds out that she is pregnant Mahesh leaves the city and the next time she meets him is on his wedding with a rich girl in the big city. Meena is thrown out of her uncle's house and upon giving birth to a baby boy her despair and Mahesh's further rejection cause her to abandon him in a dark forest. When she comes back to senses and runs to take him back she is too late the baby was already collected by an old and kind Muslim named Abdul. Abdul decides to adopt the kid much to the charging of the HinduMuslim communities. He relocates to the city but is unable to shake the stigma of bringing up an illegitimate child Roshan. Meanwhile Meena has got married to a lawyer but her son Roshan is often subjected to all kinds of taunts by fellow classmates. He has only one friend and it is Ramesh who happens to be none other than his biological father Mahesh's son.A powerful and poignant picture 'Dhool Ka Phool' shows how destructive social prejudice can be mainly through the characters of Meena and Roshan. The fear Meena feels when she discovers she is going to be a single mother the insults Roshan has to bear every time he goes to school  all show that something is very wrong with our society. I still remember the scene when Meena comes to reproach Mahesh with the baby in her hands and threatens to scream that it is his son for all to know and he replies that she has no way to prove that and that she can throw him as far as he is concerned. That's what prompts her to do something that will torment her for the rest of her life. When Abdul Rashid takes the kid he gets excommunicated by the people because the boy's religion remains unclear. In one wonderful scene he sharply criticises them for their doublestandards and leaves the neighbourhood. The stories of Roshan and Meena get intertwined in the form of a court case in which the boy is accused of a theft for no fault of his own and the judge is none other than Mahesh.The film is brilliantly written narrated and acted and is done realistically with almost no exaggerated dramatisation. It starts as a romance and then turns into a moving drama. Mukhram Sharma's dialogues are exceptional and Narayan Datta's music is wonderfully composed with fantastic lyrics by Sahir Ludhianvi. One great song that remains relevant even today is Tu Hindu Banega Na Musalmaan Banega which is pictured on the Abdul Rashid character when he decides to take the boy despite his neighbours' opposition meaning You will grow up to be neither Hindu nor Muslim you will grow up to be a human being. Another song I like is Jo Tum Muskura Do pictured on the romantic sequences between Mahesh and Seema early in the film. Towards the end the film becomes increasingly more intense and touching. There are many moving scenes and what I find particularly good about them is that they are never overdone enhancing the emotional impact.The acting is roundly excellent. The film belongs to Mala Sinha and she is absolutely astonishing. She displays the fear the confusion and the pain of a wronged woman and later the suffering and the guilt feelings of a mother who has lost her child with total conviction. Sushil Kumar the child artist is amazing as Roshan. This is according to me one of the best performances by a child actor in Indian cinema. Speaking of child actors Daisy Irani is fantastic as Ramesh. Manmohan Krishna is a showstealer. He makes Abdul Rasheed the simple and kind Muslim man a memorable character which should set an example to all of us of how important it is to be a good human being rather than a religious person. Rajendra Kumar's character is not sympathetic and he is appropriately hateful. The great Ashok Kumar on the other hand is very likable delivering another brilliantly restrained and elegantly understated performance as Meena's loving husband. Other cast members include Nanda and Leela Chitnis both of whom lend excellent support in smaller parts.The most disturbing scene in the film which remains symbolic even today is when Meena abandons the baby in the forest. The crying baby instinctively grabs her saree as if pleading not to leave him. But she does. This is followed by an impressively miraculous moment when a snake approaches the baby and while one would worriedly expect it to attack him it instead stops by to guard his life. It is particularly heartbreaking to see Meena hurriedly returning to take him back only to find he is not there anymore. But the best scene in the film happens later when Meena and Roshan meet for the first time obviously not knowing that they are actually a mother and son. The moment the boy breaks down as he tells her of his loneliness post a very tragic incident see the film to understand which one and accidentally calls her mom when she hugs him is so deeply moving. This is one of the most powerful scenes I've ever seen on film and Chopra captures it with great intensity. The film's ending is bittersweet. It is both heartbreaking and heartwarming and the same can be said about the movie itself. 'Dhool Ka Phool' is Yash Chopra's ultimate masterwork his first and perhaps his finest. It is one of my alltime favourite films. I highly recommend that you see this gem.".

	onyx:emotionText "'Dhool Ka Phool' Yash Chopra's amazing directorial debut is a classic of classics. The film is about the social norms of those times showing their effect on people of that time. This is the story of Meena Mala Sinha a young and orphaned woman who lives with her aunt and uncle. Meena meets Mahesh and the two fall in love. However when she finds out that she is pregnant Mahesh leaves the city and the next time she meets him is on his wedding with a rich girl in the big city. Meena is thrown out of her uncle's house and upon giving birth to a baby boy her despair and Mahesh's further rejection cause her to abandon him in a dark forest. When she comes back to senses and runs to take him back she is too late the baby was already collected by an old and kind Muslim named Abdul. Abdul decides to adopt the kid much to the charging of the HinduMuslim communities. He relocates to the city but is unable to shake the stigma of bringing up an illegitimate child Roshan. Meanwhile Meena has got married to a lawyer but her son Roshan is often subjected to all kinds of taunts by fellow classmates. He has only one friend and it is Ramesh who happens to be none other than his biological father Mahesh's son.A powerful and poignant picture 'Dhool Ka Phool' shows how destructive social prejudice can be mainly through the characters of Meena and Roshan. The fear Meena feels when she discovers she is going to be a single mother the insults Roshan has to bear every time he goes to school  all show that something is very wrong with our society. I still remember the scene when Meena comes to reproach Mahesh with the baby in her hands and threatens to scream that it is his son for all to know and he replies that she has no way to prove that and that she can throw him as far as he is concerned. That's what prompts her to do something that will torment her for the rest of her life. When Abdul Rashid takes the kid he gets excommunicated by the people because the boy's religion remains unclear. In one wonderful scene he sharply criticises them for their doublestandards and leaves the neighbourhood. The stories of Roshan and Meena get intertwined in the form of a court case in which the boy is accused of a theft for no fault of his own and the judge is none other than Mahesh.The film is brilliantly written narrated and acted and is done realistically with almost no exaggerated dramatisation. It starts as a romance and then turns into a moving drama. Mukhram Sharma's dialogues are exceptional and Narayan Datta's music is wonderfully composed with fantastic lyrics by Sahir Ludhianvi. One great song that remains relevant even today is Tu Hindu Banega Na Musalmaan Banega which is pictured on the Abdul Rashid character when he decides to take the boy despite his neighbours' opposition meaning You will grow up to be neither Hindu nor Muslim you will grow up to be a human being.

The scene where she leaves her baby in the woods coming as it does at 65 minutes in is pretty harrowing stuff she takes the easy solution but finds almost instantly it was the wrong one and ultimately nearly impossible to live with.

There's all kinds of social political religious and personal commentaries going on too many to mention  the previous excellent comment covered it all well  and everything dovetails at the end to a fairly logical conclusion. The only minor niggle I ever had was that no matter how logical the last section dragged on for far too long. The songs were by Sahir and Dutta my favourites being Tere Pyar Ka Aasra entrancingly sung by Mahendra Kapoor and Lata and the beautiful Jhukti Gaata Gaati Hawa sung by Asha with an unusual middle section by Mahendra  and Nanda seldom looked more exquisite or regal the whole song being a wondrous piece of poetic sound and vision. I freely confess to preferring happy songs with no dark clouds!All the leads seemed incredibly photogenic with some marvellous photography and generally excellent production values in fact some of the sets and costumes would have looked gorgeous in colour.

Jennifer Connelly's role is much smaller but she makes the most of it. Djiman Housou has enormous physical presence as the brave Mende fisherman.

The ending that they chose extends the film too far seems forced and is tacked on. The more natural ending is on the mountainside  you'll know what I mean when you see it. Those things said the positives are much greater and this film showcased two towering performances. Djimon Hounsou is nothing short of incredible and I'd be astonished if he isn't considered at Oscar time. Secondly although I've had little patience for him before Leonardo DiCaprio has really impressed me this year. With his performances in 'The Departed' and now 'Blood Diamond' I think I need to reappraise my own biases against him. I'm becoming a fan.Some of the early reviews that I read painted 'Blood Diamond' as hysterical leftwinger causehead paradise. They suggest that the conflict diamond situation has been exaggerated and completely distorted. I don't know if that is the case. The film makes a compelling case but I don't base my political and economic decisions on films that I watch. My interest here was to see how characters would respond to adversity and a terrible horrifyingly dark situation. The political agenda of the film isn't as cloyingly bombastic as I was afraid it might be. This is a film that while concerned with the political situation in Africa focuses more on how the obsessive search for a large rare pink diamond consumes those who get too close to it.DiCaprio is excellent as a Rhodesian HIS description mercenary and arms dealer working in Sierra Leone. Hounsou is a fisherman who gets drawn into the civil war raging around him and discovers a pink diamond that could save  or destroy  both he and his family. Jennifer Connelly plays a journalist trying to discover if a huge multinational diamond company is knowingly in the market for conflict diamonds. Jennifer Connelly seems to get the worst of the dialogue. When told that Americans are in part to blame for conflict diamonds she responds with a line about 'not all girls want a fantasy wedding.' It makes her look naive at best and silly at worst. She generally manages to save the character from either of those fates though and also manages to avoid selfrighteousness when dealing with some of the films more morally flexible characters. Hounsou is great and the desperation in his character as he tries to find his family crackles on the screen. He is cagey and understands what he needs to do to survive. His character is not above playing servile if that will keep him alive. And when provoked to violence the result was absolutely chilling. In much smaller roles are Arnold Vosloo as a mercenary Colonel Stephen Collins as a diplomat and Michael Sheen as an executive at a diamond company. Excellent performances all around.Is 'Blood Diamond' judgemental? I think that is the wrong question. The film is a character study both of all the men pursuing the pink diamond and what effect it has on them but it is also a character study of Africa. Tragic and heartsick 'Blood Diamond' is drenched with cynicism and defeatism. Why is there misery and exploitation? TIA explains DiCaprio to Connelly This Is Africa. In contrast to a film like 'Traffic' 'Blood Diamond' doesn't wallow in hopelessness. Some of the characters might be cynical but the film itself does search for hope. The heart of the picture is the human cost. Characters see the wealth of the diamond and are destroyed by it. The film shares a great deal thematically with a film like 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre.' High praise for a high quality film.".

With a set of natural instincts that lends a nonshowy believable quality to all of his performances versatility and movie star size charisma that fills up the screen and emotionally hooks the viewer into his character and story it is hard to think of another male American actor with the exception of Johnny Depp who is consistently giving an audience its money worth these two gentleman have taken the reins from Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington as those two Oscarwinning future legends of the silver screen gracefully age into more mature roles.In Blood Diamond it is Mr. DiCaprio's performance that raises this film above it's standard Hollywood fare of a script although it is a solid script into something memorable. His performance here as an opportunistic diamond smuggler equals that of the one he gave earlier in the fall as Billy Costigan in The Departed although the two characters couldn't be more different from each other. It may be his best performance yet and in terms of sheer charisma and memorability it certainly rivals his megastar making performance as Jack Dawson in Titanic. I liked Blood Diamond a great deal but do not think it is a great film. A good movie? Yes. Very mainstream and formulaic but it is raised up quite a bit by DiCaprio's character and his terrific realization of it. If I had read this script beforehand I never would have thought of Leo for this role possibly George Clooney or some other star known for roguish charm but not Leo. But now having seen it I can't imagine anybody else as Danny Archer it is a fully realized winning performance.Mr. Hounsou was wonderful as well and I liked the chemistry between the two men in their scenes together. He was able to make the audience feel the gamut of emotions his character experiences during the course of the movie pride and hope fear outrage resignation mistrust desperation and determination and beautifully rises above the somewhat limiting way his role was written.I thought Ms. Connelly did as good a job as possible in her role as the idealistic journalist who wants to make a difference. Her part was just a larger version of Joaquin Phoenix's in Hotel Rwanda. As always I find she brings a certain dignity and intelligence to her performances and does not allow her incredible beauty to overshadow her acting. I thought she and Leo worked wonderfully together as well and along with Mr. Hounsou they make an engaging trio you can't help rooting for.In comparing it to other recent films about Africa I didn't think this was quite as good as as Hotel Rwanda but better than The Interpreter The Constant Gardener and The Last King of Scotland. I felt an emotional engagement with the characters I didn't experience in the latter three films. I found the script allowed my care for the characters to grow as the story progressed and was not overly manipulative. At times it veered too much into standard action movie territory with much violence and many close calls but would then be brought back into the realm of compelling human drama by a wonderfully acted intimate scene.After reading some early negative comments I was pleasantly surprised at my response to it. Compelling characters and the skillful use of a truly gripping global issue as the plot line make this a satisfying viewing experience one that I would happily see again.".

Never before or since have I been in a location where I was surrounded by so much bling. Storefronts had so many diamonds on display you would think they should be better kept in some European version of Fort Knox.The film Blood Diamond puts an entirely new spin on Antwerp the diamond industry and that pricey stone you might be wearing around your neck on your ring finger or in your ears mine are cubicZs. Set in the West African country of Sierra Leone during the 1990s this historicaladventuredrama covers a time when the country was in turmoil. Warlords smugglers and the diamond syndicate all play roles in a refugee exodus and the killing and enslaving of men to work the diamond fields. The title refers to diamonds which are harvested smuggled and traded to finance the purchase of weapons used in Civil War.Solomon Vandy Djimon Hounsou stars as a fisherman who has his family torn apart and instead of being killed is sent to work mining diamonds where he finds and hides a large stone. Danny Archer Leonardo DiCaprio a former mercenary diamondsmuggler middleman younameit is looking to score with that stone and exit the business for good. Writer Maddy Bowen Jennifer Connelly is tired of writing shallow stories about less than newsworthy events she is looking for information about major players in the diamond trade. They all come together in a fast paced adventure packed piece of filmmaking that is brutal at times but never boring. The film has a pleasant unanticipated ending something hard to pull off in a film of this kind.DirectorProducer Edward Zwick is probably the best in Hollywood at taking a big budget feature film with a historical theme and carefully relay a message without lecturing his audience. His earlier works include a story of the first allblack U.S. Civil War company in Glory a film which resulted in Denzel Washington winning his first Oscar. Zwick takes credit for works like The Last Samurai Shakespeare in Love Traffic and Courage Under Fire. He is second to no one when it comes to balancing a historical event with actiondrama entertainment. Edward Zwick is one of few L.A. directors who still works within the Hollywood establishment yet is able to put out good quality film. Check out Blood Diamond your bling may never look the same again.".

Because the story line is so true and the acting writing directing locations people and photography are all superior I must admit prejudice toward such a high rating. My local reviewer gave it a B.My exposure to the civil war and only some of the events of this movie were based on reading books hundreds of witness statements online material about the war including the Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation Report and listening to over 100 witnesses testify and my trial was not even those of the RUF and AFRC the really bad actors of the war as the movie shows pulling no punches. The accounts of atrocities are shockingly real. Tens of thousands had hands amputated people were indiscriminately murdered women raped or forced to marry villages were burned and children were kidnapped and forced to fight the war for both of the rebel factions RUF and AFRC. Making a child a soldier is a war crime and this movie artfully shows you why without saying a word about it.Sherman said about our own Civil War that War is hell. But African civil war is far different and atrocious because it inevitably leads to atrocities. This fine work with Hotel Rwanda stands out as a film seriously attempting to explain the atrocities that Africans somehow can do to themselves.".

I must say the movie was graphic at times but I think it needed to be in order to get the point across so if you have trouble watching terrible things happen to people including children then I wouldn't recommend this movie.

Awarding him an Oscar for Blood Diamond would not be a big enough compliment for the way he aced the role of Danny Archer.The fabulous  flawless Charles Leavitt script is only enhanced by Ed Zwick's masterful directing job. Djimon Hounsou is perfectly cast and is morethanbelievable when he wields a shovel.And Jennifer Connelly's understated elegance  expressiveness is captivating.

How do I express my utter satisfaction  amazement with this film.Take Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance over the last 15 years and multiply it by 10. He is mindblowing. Awarding him an Oscar for Blood Diamond would not be a big enough compliment for the way he aced the role of Danny Archer.The fabulous  flawless Charles Leavitt script is only enhanced by Ed Zwick's masterful directing job. Djimon Hounsou is perfectly cast and is morethanbelievable when he wields a shovel.And Jennifer Connelly's understated elegance  expressiveness is captivating. Put this movie at the top of your list.";

'Blood Diamond' is a beautifully shot war thriller set against the backdrop of the Sierra Leone civil war starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou in their Oscarnominated roles. By far one of the best war dramas of modern times 'Blood Diamond' is a powerful testament in the film industry boasting intense and wellexecuted action scenes and heartwrenching drama.

	schema:reviewBody "Blood Diamond is an excellent example of how Hollywood formulas can suck the essence out of a unique work of art. The film is exceptionally well done with great performances wellwritten characters good research and above all shocking messages. To all those reviewers who thought it wasn't interesting Are you kidding me? Three of the most horrible tragedies of our times are shown in the film  Africa's childwarriors  Militialed smuggling supporting brutal civil wars and exploiting ancient hatred  The diamond monopoly and its ruthlessness. And the film shows how these are intertwined! If this doesn't touch you I don't know what will. But perhaps here lies the film's greatest fault. As other reviewers have eloquently mentioned it apparently thinks it HAS to use Hollywood formulas in order to get the point across to a wide audience so we have superstars a romantic subplot a cheesy ending lots of action. And this combined with the heavy messages of the plot is just too much. It is no coincidence that so many reviewers used words such as odd and confusing. They didn't mean they didn't follow the film they just didn't know why it was going there and back and forth again. Which was my feeling exactly. It's like listening to a beautiful song with great lyrics and just as the text is about to grasp you a cheesy saxsolo rises. The film had too many saxsolos for its worth. It touched extremely important issues but didn't have the guts to look the audience in the eye and scream out Are you finally listening? Look around you! The Hollywood gutlessness is best shown in the final comments They do explicitly mention the diamond industry's exploits but then they advise the audience to demand diamonds from peaceful areas. What? After having shown that the industry holds prices ridiculously high by convincing everyone that diamonds are valuable as such and oh so rare? And that you just NEED to buy or have diamonds as a sign of class power and most importantly love... And all the producers want us to do is to ask nicely for a good diamond?...If that movie touched you find out more about the diamond brainwash and the African civil war tragedies. Open your eyes.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is quiet intensity and explosive intensity. I was going to say that 'Blood Diamond' makes no pretense about subscribing to the latter but the fact is that it does. On the one hand it treats heavy salient issues like diamond trade and the trafficking of childsoldiers in Africa even including a few lines of warning in the credits but on the other hand it is structured and executed like a generic adventure treasure hunt. It cannot decide what it wants to be and regrettably botches through both paths.Set against the backdrop of civil war and chaos in 1990's Sierra Leone Blood Diamond follows Rhodesian mercenary oooh scary! Danny Archer Leonardo Dicaprio Mende fisherman Solomon Vandy Djimon Hounsou and American journalist Maddy Bowen Jennifer Connelly on a quest to find a rare pink diamond that Solomon first found when he was forced to work in the diamond fields. It intertwines bouts of bloodsoaked encounters with childsoldiers one of which is Solomon's own son that has been taken from him and with emotional blackmail it cues us in to feel for the miserable conditions in Africa and the venality with which things are run. The problem is that every slightly serious sceneevery momentis interrupted by some loud explosion gun violence or shouting and sometimes all three. This is irritating in the film and it suggests two things the script is unbearably lazy and sees action galore as a plot device and way to avoid writing the end of 'difficult' scenes with conversation or character development or 'Blood Diamond' tells us that we should not take it seriously and just treat it as any runofthemill actionadventure. The problem with this is that it lacks the charm and sparkle in the eye of 'Indiana Jones' and Dicaprio is much too moody and unlikeable as a protagonist.I have not yet seen many of the Oscar nominated actors' performances but Leonardo Dicaprio's interpretation of the hardboiled mercenary is the least deserving so far. It baffles me that such an actionoriented adventure with such a testosteronefuelled lead could snag nominations with the dramafavouring academy and I suspect this is solely because of its hazy political core. In comparison Dicaprio is like Daniel Craig in Casino Royale but without the serious emotional scenes. Apparently his South African accent is fairly intune according to South Africans but it seems uneven exaggerated and varying in pronunciation to me.None of the other performances are noteworthy either. Djimon Hounsou shouting does not a good performance make. Jennifer Connelly warms up slightly in her role shifting from her usual emotionally numb and somber state to being a little smilier but here she is at the mercy of an underwritten character and there are not many ways in which she can go. The supporting cast for 'Blood Diamond' may be rather onedimensional caricatures of evil corporate white men and black hardedged guerilla leaders with berets but they serve their respective functions rather aptly especially Michael Sheen's brief appearance. The only issue I have here is that African people speak broken English to each other. Even if they're from the same family.In the end 'Blood Diamond' snags the 6 out of 10 from me. The cinematography is gorgeous with a screen that is awash with dramatic colours and shots the action is fastpaced and exciting and the atmosphere is admirably gritty and visceral in the deep jungles of Africa. It features a ridiculous twofaced mix between heavyhanded politics  la Constant Gardener and adrenalinepumping action  la... any action film. It should in all theory be possible to join these two sides and 'Blood Diamond' possesses all the necessary ingredients to do so but no blender in which to stir it.6 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this film in theaters with my brother and mother. I personally had no idea what the movie was going to be about I am just a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan so I decided to check it out. I ended up loving the movie it was so interesting because it was about something I had no idea was going on in the world and probably would never have learned about since I am a teenage boy and am not very interested in Diamonds. While watching the film I was just in complete shock the whole time. With in ten minutes of the film a peaceful village is ambushed and massacred by rebels the director also was not shy about showing the gruesomeness of people being killed. I could not believe the things that were happening in this movie people were either forced into slavery or murdered. Children were kidnapped and brainwashed. The kids were doing Drugs and murdering people it was really disturbing to see. I could not believe that this stuff was really happening in Africa but the film showed the statistics of the deaths of all the people from mining diamonds and it was all the proof I needed. Asides from all the graphic and disturbing scenes in the movie I loved the story line of a African man Solomon Vandy trying to find his kidnapped son while Leonardo DiCaprio is more interested in finding the extremely rare and valuable Blood Diamond which Solomon Vandy has hidden in a rebel camp. I also love the transformation of Leonardo DiCaprios character from a selfish only cares about him self to a stand up guy who is willing to give up anything in the end for his new friend Solomon. I also Enjoyed the third main character Jennifer Connolly who is trying to bring light to conflict diamonds to the rest of the world so this madness can finally stop. Overall I loved the film and highly recommend it to any one aside from the graphic scenes its a great film for anyone over the age of 13 I thought the acting was great and so was the story line and all the imagery used.".

I personally had no idea what the movie was going to be about I am just a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan so I decided to check it out. I ended up loving the movie it was so interesting because it was about something I had no idea was going on in the world and probably would never have learned about since I am a teenage boy and am not very interested in Diamonds. While watching the film I was just in complete shock the whole time. With in ten minutes of the film a peaceful village is ambushed and massacred by rebels the director also was not shy about showing the gruesomeness of people being killed. I could not believe the things that were happening in this movie people were either forced into slavery or murdered. Children were kidnapped and brainwashed. The kids were doing Drugs and murdering people it was really disturbing to see. I could not believe that this stuff was really happening in Africa but the film showed the statistics of the deaths of all the people from mining diamonds and it was all the proof I needed. Asides from all the graphic and disturbing scenes in the movie I loved the story line of a African man Solomon Vandy trying to find his kidnapped son while Leonardo DiCaprio is more interested in finding the extremely rare and valuable Blood Diamond which Solomon Vandy has hidden in a rebel camp. I also love the transformation of Leonardo DiCaprios character from a selfish only cares about him self to a stand up guy who is willing to give up anything in the end for his new friend Solomon. I also Enjoyed the third main character Jennifer Connolly who is trying to bring light to conflict diamonds to the rest of the world so this madness can finally stop. Overall I loved the film and highly recommend it to any one aside from the graphic scenes its a great film for anyone over the age of 13 I thought the acting was great and so was the story line and all the imagery used.";

	schema:headline " A Terrific Movie Though Let Down Slightly By Its Ending";
	schema:reviewBody "In all of the movies that he has starred in that I have seen up until Catch Me If You Can Leonardo DiCaprio has delivered reasonable but hardly blockbusting performances. He had a superbly roguish charm in Titanic and provided a considerable amount of tension in Gangs of New York but these performances still didn't have the extra oomph that would boost the star to awardworthy levels.However since watching Catch Me If You Can I have developed a deep respect for DiCaprio. Ever since that movie his performances have just been getting better and better. And just after the breathless exhilaration of his brilliant performance in Martin Scorsese's The Departed Blood Diamond came out in cinemas.Before I continue with the review for the rest of the film I have something to say. As smuggler and former soldier Danny Archer DiCaprio gives a riproaring heartpulsating performance of such breathtaking quality that he almost steals the movie from under the very talented noses of Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly.With an absolutely topnotch accent and a gruff attitude that will undoubtedly insult a few Titanic fans DiCaprio takes a huge risk with this role and ends up giving one of the best performances of his career. He is 100 believable in every minute of the film that he graces and oozes crackling intensity. If I were asked to describe the performance in one sentence I would say that it was undeniably Oscar worthy.Sierra Leone 1999. Fisherman Soloman Vandy's Djimon Hounsou life is destroyed when rebels invade his village and separate him from his family. Forced to work in the diamond fields Solomon discovers a rare pink diamond. He manages to hide it but not before the leader of the rebels Captain Poison David Harewood sees the diamond. Whilst being held in prison for being associated with rebels Solomon encounters smuggler Danny Archer DiCaprio who says that he will help Solomon to find his family in exchange for the diamond. Together with reporter Maddy Bowen Jennifer Connelly Danny and Solomon set out to track down both Solomon's family and the diamond which is still in hostile territory. I have only seen one other movie directed by Edward Zwick and that was the flawed yet brilliant Last Samurai. True Blood Diamond is flawed but it manages to match and in some areas such as the topnotch story and cast even surpass The Last Samurai in sheer quality. Zwick does a marvellous job crafting some compelling action to go along with smart ideas and realism.The acting is the most impressive factor in the movie. In my opinion the only cast member who is able to stand against the wrath of DiCaprio is Djimon Hounsou. As Solomon Vandy Hounsou delivers a performance full of such true raw emotion that he confidently ensures that DiCaprio doesn't blow him off the screen. There are some moments of Hounsou's performance which are so heartbreakingly human and turmoiled that you aren't likely to forget this exceptional performance for a long time. Praise also for Jennifer Connelly who delivers an energetic feisty and humane portrayal of the film's main female character.However there are also scenestealing turns from two members of the supporting cast David Harewood and Arnold Vosloo. As the rebel captain who kidnaps Solomon's son amongst other things in order to find the diamond of the title Harewood oozes a sadistic type of charisma. In one scene after confronting a worker trying to conceal a diamond that he has just discovered the captain calmly and smoothly shoots the worker in the stomach at point blank range before walking away as if it were completely normal. He is an absolutely topnotch villain perfectly realised by Harewood. As a colonel and friend of Archer's Vosloo gives a performance of gripping authority and commanding presence which makes the character much more than the caricature that he could have so easily become. His final scene is strangely poignant due to the superb character moments between him and DiCaprio. The settings visuals and cinematography in the movie are also superb adding a grand sense of grim reality and beauty to the proceedings. Its message is also pure and meaningful and would have been perfectly realised if it weren't for the films only flaw. That flaw is called the ending.There was the potential for an absolutely perfect ending. After being fatally wounded Archer dies on the side of a cliff whilst Solomon and his son fly to safety. That ending would have been the final factor that would have convinced me to give the movie full marks. But unfortunately Zwick tries to bite off more than he can chew. His direction up until this point is always confident and assured never becoming bogged down. But the ending feels like it has just been put into the movie as a last minute attempt to handle more political issues which ultimately results in the betrayal of the rest of the movie. However this is only one flaw although it is reasonably significant. The overall result is a thrilling yet intelligent movie with powerful performances captivating visuals and and cinematography and effective emotional power. I highly recommend it even if you just want to watch Leonardo DiCaprio or Djimon Hounsou.".

Sounds an awful lot like the line from A Place in the Sun where Bruce Willis says God left Africa a long time ago. Seems to me that the writers could have worked a little harder at being a little more original. Wouldn't something like God long ago deserted Africa  her people have been more original  just as powerful? I consider this a greater flaw than technical inaccuracies thus 9 stars out of 10.".

This is the story of one of those slaves a diamond smuggler with connections to Belgium England And Liberia and a journalist. Together they will fight to win a story a diamond and a family. But sacrifices will be made.We have an amazing cast so let me just get them out of the way  Leonardo DiCaprio as smuggler Danny Archer Djimon Hounsou as native African Solomon Vandy and Jennifer Connelly as journalist Maddy Bowen. DiCaprio rarely makes bad films and my unending praise for Connelly is seen in a variety of reviews I've written... this film will be no exception to her glowing track record.This film has action suspense and a good story to tell. Like The Insider or whatever the tobacco movie is called this exposes how diamonds come to be on the market. I'd like to say things have improved since the time period shown here 1990s but I don't know if I believe that. I appreciate the honest portrayal here not shying away from the violence or the horrible conditions the children go through. Humor is absent and even romance which would be so easy to add in is never at the front of the story.I don't know how to sell this film other than that if you care about world events or care about the fate of innocent people you'll care about this movie. Even if you don't want this to be that heavy and just take it as entertainment which it is on some levels I think you'll still enjoy it Jennifer Connelly!. Wish I could say more but it's a cut and dry case great movie worth seeing check it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Blood Diamond is a brilliant movie! It's a rare gem that sends a huge political message on one of the many malevolent schemes and systems that are happening in this world! This one in particular are the trade and smuggling of Blood Diamonds and Child Soldiers. The movie is very disturbing. Rarely do we a see a motion picture show such horrible schemes going on in the world. It's the story of a fisherman Soloman Vandy with high hopes for his son when his village is burned down and ruined by the RUF. He's is separated from his family and is sent to work in Diamond hunting camps. Where he finds a huge gem hides it barely escaping with his life and the story ensues from their on end. Taking place during the civil war in Sierra Leone. The movie accurately portrays the corruptness of the malevolent smuggling scheme used for smuggling conflict diamonds and the even more disturbing use of child soldiers. Young children are kidnapped and go by the doctrine of men who convince them of evil and that their family are weakness's utilising them as weapons. If you've seen 'Kony 2012' you get the idea. It's used to great effect on one of the story lines in which Soloman's son in kidnapped and transformed into a child soldier. Displaying the morale of the bond between father and son no matter what.The second underlying story is of Danny Archer Leonardo DiCaprio an ex solider turned business man who is a definitive example of damaged characters. He is keen on nothing more than leaving Africa due to the horrible things he's seen in this 'uncivilised' place. He has to battle with his inner demons and desire to find whats right. He bonds brilliant with Soloman in the movie even though at first he had the intentions to exploit the situation which he is in. He falls in love with Maddy Jennifer Conolly whose character has the different convictions and believes in hope. Something that's been taken from him young of age. The third underlying story is of Maddy Bowen Jennifer Conolly a journalist who's on the struggle to do good. To make change in the world. She's an amazing representation of finding love and hope in small things and how an individual can change the world as you see her struggle to change the world and get the information on conflict diamonds. These three riveting story lines are flawlessly sewed together to present a masterpiece taken place during rough times yet utilising the beauty of Africa in the cinematography to give you an entertaining movie with great dialogue satisfying villain soul shattering soundtrack and many morals including how you look at jewellery and good things happen everyday Maddy Bowen.Please watch this movie!".

	schema:headline " Pretty good Spanish horrorcomedy in which the sympathetic starring goes back to his village and finds amazing surprises";
	schema:reviewBody "This Spanish horrorcomedy Game of Werewolves has been heralded as as A Spanish Shaun of the Dead only with Werewolves. Attack of the Werewolves or Lobos De Arga is a Spanish language film and an entertaining one at that . 1910 in a remote village a terrible curse has fallen on the evil Marchioness of Marino and her son transforming him into a bloodthirsty werewolf who preys on the residents of the village. One hundred years on  the only male descendant of the Marino family  returns his village . After 15 years Tomas Gorka Otxoa  a not very successful writer comes back to the village in Galicia where his family comes from  Arga  apparently to get an award . He returns home to a warm welcome from the villagers but things aren't quite what they seem. After a century of being terrorized by the vicious werewolf they plan to break the curse by sacrificing him 100 years to the day when the original curse fell . But he doesn't know the real reason why he is there to end with an old curse that is been haunting the village for the last hundred years . At the village he meets an old friend Carlos Areces  his editor Secun de la Rosa  the priest Manuel Manquia and a bit later on appears his grandmother Mabel Rivera . The village of Arga has been cursed and it is up to Toms to remove this affliction . The townsfolk need his blood and his sacrifice in order to remove the curse .This title blends horror elements with comedy  tongueincheek and action  so the tone of the film is lighthearted . Lobos De Arga knows many forms this film has also been called Game of Werewolves and Attack of the Werewolves which is the United Kingdom title  if one directly translates the Spanish title into English then it becomes the much simpler Werewolves of Arga . It's a veritable buffet of the cream of recent Spanish horror plenty of action  laughs  and werewolves attacks . Likable acting by Gorka Otxoa as Thomas  an unsuccessful writer lured out to a remote rural village who must defeat the villagers and pit his wits against a violent beast in . Enjoyable main cast and agreeable support actors deliver one of the most engaging hysterical action packed and wonderfully shot werewolf movies in years . Intriguing and thrilling musical score by Sergio Moure who has demonstrated his particular talent on dark atmospheres such as The Body Thesis on a homicide and Kidnapped . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Carlos Ferro  showing splendidly Galician sets . This Spanish horrorcomedy Attack of the Werewolves was much praised by critics as well as public during its European festival run . The motion picture was originally made by directorwriter Juan Martnez Moreno who formerly directed A Good Man and Two Tough Guys . He clearly demonstrates sound knowledge of the genre he deconstructs with heartfelt accuracy . Rating  Good  above average . Well worth watching .".

Still if you like horror comedies you will enjoy this one too for exactly those things.It's not a movie with a lot of weight or a lot to say it's just entertaining and a nice way to pass the time. The characters are good and the story moves along quite nicely too. Some jokes might have more meaning in Spanish but you will get quite a lot with the subtitles too.

For those of us tired of melodramatic art movements like Gothic Romanticism it's a breath of fresh air to see a monster who for once isn't sexy and erotic.On the other hand this is still an ode to Gothic horror  it just has all the soap opera parts ripped out and replaced with black humor. So if you're expecting a radically different approach then I think you'll be a bit disappointed.The plot is straight out of a Lovecraft or Poe tale and indeed it namedrops both authors halfway through the story. The setup is pretty standard for Gothic horror a small rural village a cursed bloodline a horrible secret and of course a large mansion. Still the tropes are used well making for an engaging and frequently funny story. The humor is very black  think more like ReAnimator than Evil Dead. Unlike An American Werewolf in London the comedy part dominates the movie with little time actually given to gore horror or special effects. Of course this is understandable given the small budget but it would have been nice to see more horror at least.".

	schema:reviewBody "Newly released horror movies like Game of Werewolves boost up my confidence hope and enthusiasm that the genre isn't  contrary to popular belief  dead and buried just yet! Even allegedly exhausted and oldfashioned themes like for example werewolves can still result in refreshingly original and terrific films it all just depends on dedicated cast and crew members that demonstrate an obvious respect and worship towards the genre. Heck Game of Werewolves even proves that it's very well possible to make a horror effort that is scary and gross but simultaneously funny and lightheaded. Writerdirector Juan Martnez Moreno together with his excellent ensemble cast and crew clearly has the right attitude towards the horror genre and obviously knows his classics. When he was present at the Brussels Festival of Fantastic Films to introduce the movie to the audience he stated that he was fed up  like all the rest of us or at least me  with the nowadays portrayal of werewolves and intended to make them iconic monsters again. Game of Werewolves is first and foremost an ode to the legendary classic Universal horror movies in terms of storytelling and atmosphere and the immortal lycanthrope hits of the 1980's in terms of special effect and transformation makeup American Werewolf in London and The Howling of course. I'm usually very skeptic when directors claim they want to revive traditional horror values but Moreno is one of the first directors who actually deliver their promise! Straight from the moodily narrated opening sequences you just know the film will be a genuine treat! The narration guided by neat drawings tells us about a malignant Duchess who lived in a small Galician town around the year 1900. She desperately wanted to have a child but her husband couldn't give it to her so she kidnapped and maleraped a handsome gypsy male that traveled through the region. After she was impregnated the Duchess ordered the villagers to slaughter the father as well as his entire gypsy community to eliminate any link with the boy's father. Just before dying one of the gypsy women cursed the Duchess and foretold that her son would turn into a werewolf at the age of 10 and he would terrorize the village for all eternity. The only way for the curse to break would be the sacrifice of a direct descendant of the Duchess. More than a century later Tomas  a debuting author with a severe case of writer's block  retires to the area to work about a new novel. Little does he know that his greataunt was the evil Duchess and that he will serve as werewolf bait to lift up the curse. This short description actually just illustrates a very brief part of the film. The story is much more convoluted and elaborated but it's too much of a joy to discover yourself. Just know that the screenplay is very wellstructured coherent and waterproof. All the main characters are extremely likable which is also a rare quality to encounter in horror movies and there's a masterful interchange of sequences that are downright hilarious the finger! and sequences that are good oldfashioned scary and tense the unfolding of the subsequent curse. The finale is grotesque and outrageous without becoming ridiculous and the unpretentiousness of it all is a great added value. The filming locations and scenery are perfect and hallelujah for the special effects. Damn all them films like Twilight Underworld and whatever else to hell Game of Werewolves is the real stuff!".

	onyx:emotionText "Now this is a horror comedy you should definitely sink your teeth into.No pun intended.Lobos de Arga is an example where horror and comedy are nicely balanced and is filled with surprises and twists.It also doesn't shy away from showing blood and gore.The werewolves portrayed don't mess about.There is a genuine threat coming from the werewolves which is good since visually they might not be the most convincing or scary.Through their fierceness and actions however it becomes clear these are proper monsters in your face Twilight.Lobos de Arga is a fast paced film but has a good build up where it sets up the mood and ambiance first before the craziness takes the upper hand.How crazy?Wellso much is happeningI would not know where to begin.Take my word for it you will root for the characters and at the same time laugh at them because of some of the events they have to go through.The main characters are extremely likable including the Jack Russel named Vito.What are you waiting for go see this at once.A must watch!";

And thankfully are growing an ever faithful audience. Whether it be a comedy horror a splatter fest or an hardcore horror there's something for everyone.Werewolf films certainly good ones are not always easy to find and Game of is easily one of the best beautifully fusing humour and horror into one. Synopsis After 15 years Tomas a not very successful writer comes back to the village in Galicia where his family comes from Arga apparently to get an award. But he doesn't know the real reason why he is there until it's too late...Immediately what springs to mind is that the three main characters Gorka Otxoa Carlos Areces and Secun de la Rosa are fun interesting warm characters with heart and soul. A rarity since some characters in horror you delight in their grisly deaths These guys aren't those. As funny as they are clearly there's a real bond between the actors characters that comes through and makes them joyful to watch.Equally the setting of the film based in one small place means there is ample opportunity to create long dark spaces dimly lit chambers with golden candlelight as a guide and atmospherical surroundings. All of which are done to blistering swell effectSpeaking of effects I'd be remiss to forget the creature make up. How nice it is to see largely practical effects. Yes I don't mind CGI but there's something altogether more charming about practical old school effects sure there's some CGI but it's really not that noticeable I feel.The humour is fantastic there's so many moments that are laugh out loud the finger scene is ridiculously funny and it never tries too hard to make us laughing coming across with a natural flair.And it must be said the final twist is a fun howler!I dislike reviews comparing this to Shaun of the Dead this is both different and interesting without the need for comparisons. Want a good werewolf flick? Check this out and as far as foreign horror goes this is an hilariously Spanish jab at the werewolf sub genre.".

Not that the comedy isn't good but for once is actually a lot of fun and truly hilarious with wordplay and sight gags combined together to create several riotous scenes that mesh well together with the more serious tone in the rest of the film.

This is fairly accurate as far as the entertainment quota goes and its about as scary as Shaun of the Dead too 1 but the plot not a SOTD rip off. Calling it SOTD only with werewolves is lazy. It deserves to be discussed on it's own merits.The movie is subtitled which while never being ideal doesn't ruin the fun2. There are a lot of laugh out laugh moments which tells you that is it a genuinely funny script. The characters are great fun and nicely rounded3. The humour is a bit school boyish but that never stopped The Young Ones or The Inbetweeners being a hit did it. There's even a plucky pet dog who gets a lot of action and earns a couple of belly laughs.The werewolves are possibly a tiny bit too man in fluffy costume but I admire the director's take on FX vs CGI. Would a CGI werewolf been any better??? No. I very much doubt they had a Lord of The Rings style CGI budget to blow on this movie. Anyway this movie isn't really about the horror its an badult comedy adventure.Another minor problem could be the lack of a sexy heroine but to be honest there are plenty of pure comedic genius moments to take your mind of that4 and lets face it she'd have been wasted on us non Spanish speakers because we'd be too busy reading the subtitles! All told Lobos de Arga well worth blowing 90 minutes in front of the TV and I'm planning on getting the DVD 5 too. Enjoy yourself this movie certainly gets my seal of approval.1  Shaun of the Dead was not Scary. It was a total laugh though. So is Lobos De Arga! 2  I want to watch a movie. Not miss it while reading the script! Dubbing is an underrated tool that allows the viewer to revel in the production values of the movie  kinda important if its a horror movie! Lobos De Arga has scenes in old churches and underground tunnels which I loved to check out the scenery but I'm stuck reading the script admittedly a very funny script but come on! I want my cake and I wanna eat it! 3  Look out for the hamster joke! 4  The dutch Horror comedy Kill Zombie! did have a super sexy kick ass heroine. I quite liked Kill Zombie! BUT Lobos De Arga knocks it out of the park as far fun goes.5  Is there a blu ray version? Highly unlikely is my guess more is the pity!".

Contrasting that to the one Hollywood alternative that has a werewolf in it which is the Twilight quadrupleogy? Is that what you call it when you make a trilogy into four movies to sell more tickets? Anyways I have seen this movie panned for the special effects but I've seen films such as Exorcist The Beginning that had a much larger budget and spent a great deal of it on really crappy CGI. The werewolves look just fine as monsters to me and the wire work was decent. If I were the producerdirectorwith a few millions more in the budget I could have made a movie with better production value and even a better aesthetic like making the werewolves more wolfish but faulting a director for not having enough money is not his fault. The unemployment rate in Spain right now is so high that it amazes me an armed revolution has not taken place yet over there and obviously working in film production must not be easy and like seriously I know a couple of girls that are Twilight fans and they both told me Breaking Dawn part 2 sucked. Still this film was very engaging and interesting story so much so that you will tend to forgive the plot holes.".

Toms is the writer who thinks he is to be honoured when in fact he is the direct descendant of the werewolf curse. The truth is the that villagers intend to use him to end the century old curse.

Just as what Shaun of the Dead was to the zombie genre and Lesbian Vampire Killers was to the vampire genre then Lobos de Arga steps up and puts a much needed comedy twist to the genre.Lobos de Arga is the story about Toms Mario played by Gorka Otxoa who travels to his old childhood village thinking he is about to be celebrated for his slight fame as an author. Little does he know that the village is plagued by a hundred year old curse where a werewolf is rampart and that his bloodline is needed to end the curse.The story was actually good and managed to incorporate enough comedy without it turning into a laughfest. And the amount of comedy that was here was used at all the right places with funny comments funny events and effects.As for the people hired for the various roles then I will say that people did surprisingly good jobs with their given roles and characters. And there was a lot of cool and interesting details to the characters and much witty banter in the dialogue.The effects in the movie were really great as well and the werewolves looked really cool. Even the transformation scenes were great despite being a bit 'simplistic' by today's possibilities of CGI effects. But it worked out well because it had that late 1980's werewolf transformation feel to it. And it was just right on the money.Being a Spanish movie of course the dialogue is in Spanish but it shouldn't be a thing to scare away the audience because they will lack out on a great movie.Lobos de Arga is a great movie that you owe to yourself to watch especially if you enjoy werewolf movies andor enjoyed Shaun of the Dead or Lesbian Vampire Killers.This movie gets a 7 out of 10 rating from me. You shouldn't be missing out on this particular Spanish gem.".

Mark Ruffalo and Reese Witherspoon have great chemistry and the script is smart. He's a depressed landscape architect trying to get his life back together she's a disgruntled spirit wondering what ever happened to hers. After their initial frustrations she hates how he doesn't use coasters or pick up trash in HER apartment he hates how she appears without notice in what he now considers HIS apartment they try to piece together the course of events that have left her in this state of limbo. What I loved about this film is David and Elizabeth's progression from animosity to genuine affection as they alternately pester then rely on one another. He becomes dedicated to trying to help her despite appearing insane to everyone in San Francisco except for a wonderfully quirky psychic bookstore clerk played by Jon Heder aka Napoleon Dynamite. Not since Patrick Swayze quarreled with a Whoopi Goldberg in Ghost have I been so amused by a spirit haunting a mere mortal. This is a great chick flick but would work out nice for a date too. Just have a tissue handy!".

I wonder why our movie critics and voters for Oscars and such don't give much weight to comedic actors and actresses? It takes just as much talent and actually there are in my estimation less who really pull off comedic roles well. Reese Witherspoon has done it many times and doesn't disappoint here. Most modern socalled comedies to me are simply not funny. However this movie did make me laugh. The guy who works in the psychic bookstore was hilarious. But this movie isn't all about comedy. It does touch at the heartstrings of any member of the human race who feels left out feels like they are missing it. Usually a movie has one person who the viewer can really relate to. In this case both leads played people who I could relate to.If constant special effects extreme violence streams of foul language or total realism are for you then perhaps you should skip this movie.

The movie is sweet it has a fairytale feel which is comforting in an uncertain world. The chemistry between Reese and Mark is amazing and the story is unusual and entertaining.

	schema:headline " A charming and sweet supernatural romcom with two likable leads.";
	schema:reviewBody "A romcom with a twist of the supernatural which makes the story original. This movie plays wonderfully with the audience's expectations at whether Reese Witherspoon's character Elizabeth is real as her and David played by Mark Ruffalo try and figure out why he can only see her etc. There are a couple of good twists later on as they piece things together. Though on meeting they resent each other they soon start to bond and the resentment turns into romance. The transition between dislike and love is handled extremely well at just the right pace making it believable. The script is surprisingly witty making it smart and the acting between Ruffalo and Witherspoon is really good with a lovely chemistry between them. They are so likable particularly Witherspoon at the start that you care deeply about them and just root for them to be together.This isn't really funny though I laughed a few times. It's more the comedy that makes you smile as it's charming. There are also some touching scenes as well that tug at the heartstrings but not in a way that's too sentimental like slush. In the end this was a lovely romcom and even though this came out in 2005 after the recent ones I've seen at the cinema like The Bounty Hunter The Proposal and The Ugly Truth which were awful with leads that act sexist and immature and who you can't root for making it unlovable and not funny. Just Like Heaven joins my list of others like Date Night 500 Days of Summer and arguably the best ever romcom Love Actually in the likable category. Enjoyable entertainment for it's length that puts a smile on your face. If you haven't seen this yet and want a good romcom. I would recommend Just Like Heaven because I felt like I was on it with feeling happiness as I watched it. Just lovely.".

Writer Peter Tolan formerly of Murphy Brown and currently of Rescue Me spits out yet another good film as if he has them stored in a bottomless pit. If he weren't so good at what he does one might get bored with the formula but because he is good what would be repetitive tripe in the hands of a less competent writer manages to become a series of pleasant signatures.This film is no exception to the rule governing Tolan's films and therein lies its only real flaw it is not an exceptional film with exceptional defined as Oscarworthy. With this film out of the way and Rescue Me gaining massive critical acclaim a Best Original Screenplay Oscar lies in Mr. Tolan's future as soon as he and the correct project connect. His resume already includes strong films such as My Fellow Americans America's Sweethearts and Analyze This along with slightly lesser efforts such as Stealing Harvard and his new one with the gambling theme and Just Like Heaven is a positive addition to that resume.Having conquered the popular movie genre decisively with this film all that sits between Tolan and award glory is a direct confrontation with a hotbutton issue in his signature style which includes intelligent competent actors performing as an ensemble albeit a stereotypical one characters you can not only relate to but swear were based on people you either knew or came across dialogue you might actually hear in the real world and a general morality that prohibits direct harm against one's fellow humans but permits or even cherishes human nature greed and opportunity with a hint of idealism that seems to represent Tolan's cynicism regarding the LA culture in which he participates and the injection of fantasy that reminds us that utopia will always be just beyond our reach.Tolan's writing depth is horribly wasted on a film like this but the result nonetheless is a good film that knows its purpose and limitations and keeps to task and plot throughout a very entertaining cinematic ride. Mark Ruffalo and Reese Witherspoon reprise versions of their characters from almost a halfdozen of each of their previous films cementing their legacy as this generation's Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. The film moves along at the right pace never loses sight of the plot and puts the couple of Ruffalo's character and the comatose doctor whose spirit he is chasing through the necessary obstacles before they reach that defining moment which resolves their romantic tension. I won't spill the ending but you might figure it out somewhere along the way.Anyone who studies filmmaking would do well to watch this film not only as an excellent example of the fantasy genre as Tolan and his partner Leslie Dixon lest I forget her takes the ball of the two supernatural events in the film and runs with it for a touchdown but also an example of professional filmmaking from writing to acting and cinematography to the final edit. This film is put together exactly as a good film should be. With little or nothing left to conquer in this area the head writer should be poised to take his game to the next level. Until then I'll be tuning into this one many times on cable I'm sure. I've already seen it three I think.Good film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The trailer would want to have you believe that this is another Ghost or All of me or Heavens can wait. Surprise! It's none of the above. If you really want to make up one of those tediously unimaginative summary lines of what meet what call it Sleeping Beauty meets The Constant Gardener and that would be the closest you can get.Strip the plot to the bare bones it's one of the most told tales of a workaholic young woman's discover of romance and love. Another surprise! But there is some originality in the plot although I'm not quite prepared to swear that it has not been done before. A spirit in limbo trying to save her body in a coma provides interesting material. Some critics however make too much out of the issue of a patient's right to life forgetting that it's only a necessary part of the plot and not intended to turn this light romance comedy into heavy social drama. The little twist in the end  that the person she falls in love with is the person whom someone originally wanted her to meet  is directly from the hugely successful Korean My Sassy Girl.The important thing about this genre is not really WHAT it is provided that the plot is not too farfetched but HOW it is done. In general the pace of this 90 minute movie is fine maybe dragging just a tad in the middle after the initial momentum has worn off  but not a big flaw. Some of the scenes are beautifully done particularly the rooftop scenes with the ethereal light. On acting the inimitable John Heder from Napoleon Dynamics is a delight to watch. Underrated Ruffalo has turned in good performances before in varied roles such as the flamboyant detective in In the cut and an everyday IT man in Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. Here he employs a certain degree of minimalism to portray a heartbroken young widower. The star of Just like heaven is of course Reese Witherspoon. The more you watch her the more you become aware of some of the shortcoming of Meg Ryan such as being oversappy at times and Julia Roberts such as the oneexpressionsuitsall approach.Despite the misleading trailer Just like heaven is not a remake of any of the ghostlinked romance comedies you've seen before but has a character of its own  a joy to watch.".

The little twist in the end  that the person she falls in love with is the person whom someone originally wanted her to meet  is directly from the hugely successful Korean My Sassy Girl.The important thing about this genre is not really WHAT it is provided that the plot is not too farfetched but HOW it is done. In general the pace of this 90 minute movie is fine maybe dragging just a tad in the middle after the initial momentum has worn off  but not a big flaw. Some of the scenes are beautifully done particularly the rooftop scenes with the ethereal light. On acting the inimitable John Heder from Napoleon Dynamics is a delight to watch. Underrated Ruffalo has turned in good performances before in varied roles such as the flamboyant detective in In the cut and an everyday IT man in Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. Here he employs a certain degree of minimalism to portray a heartbroken young widower. The star of Just like heaven is of course Reese Witherspoon. The more you watch her the more you become aware of some of the shortcoming of Meg Ryan such as being oversappy at times and Julia Roberts such as the oneexpressionsuitsall approach.Despite the misleading trailer Just like heaven is not a remake of any of the ghostlinked romance comedies you've seen before but has a character of its own  a joy to watch.";

On the other hand I have seen every benign supernatural movie made e.g. Powder Phenomenon Ghost Here Comes Mr. Jordan and its Warren Beatty copy etc. I especially like ones that have a strong love theme and a sound metaphysical basis.On the surface this is another chick flick love story with ghosts or life beyond death involved. I enjoyed others of this genre e.g. Kiss Me Goodbye Sally Field and James Caan Heart and Souls Robert Downey Jr and others Hello Again Shelly Long and Gabriel Byrne Defending Your life Albert Brooks and Meryl Streep City of Angels Meg Ryan and Nicholas Cage etc. This excellently written photographed and directed film surpasses all of the above by a considerable margin in my opinion.I am not about to begin to spoil this in any way. I refuse to watch previews or read detail reviews before a film as increasingly they give too much away ruining the movie. I recommend that you do the same. This film surprised me at every turn with very different twists on a basically similar theme.If this genre is your cup of tea you will probably want to see this one twice and buy the DVD. There is the obvious on the surface love story but there are many subplots undercurrents and questions raised that give this film its added punch for me.Last but not least Just Like Heaven uses 21st century computer digital film technology in an outstanding manner to enhance the flow of the whole movie. I am definitely NOT talking about the Star Wars or disaster movie harshness but rather using the special effects to make it seem that what you are seeing is really happening.Some of us do believe that some or all elements of the events that you will see could actually be possible at some time on some plane.

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps this film won't inspire the twentysomething folks at whom it was marketed. They might not appreciate its message after all when you're young life stretches out before you like an eternity. But if you're over 30 and haven't found that perfect person to share your life with it might really touch you... This is the most romantic movie I have seen in years. As a regular armchair film critic who happens to love romantic comedies but finds the quality of most to be sorely lacking I usually start to gnaw away at a film within the first five minutes. But A Lot Like Love immediately embarks on a tortuous journey of love's most confounding mileposts. The fireworks the mystery the seduction the retreat... A guy who wants to get all his ducks in a line and a gal who deals with whatever happens to come her way help each other loosen up their respective rigid perspectives on how life should be lived.The chemistry between Oliver and Emily percolates over a span of nearly seven years but neither lets it come to a full boil lest it ruin their plans. Kutcher and Peet each deliver endearing performances and actually play against the urge to gratuitously combust making for just the right emotional veracity and sexual tension to keep it real. No just add water instant love here. These two take their time to fall into the soup.This film is certainly easy to look at what with the hip modern beauty of both of its stars decorating every shot. The flyonthewall perspective of watching these two people awkwardly and trepidaciously flirt with what might be kept my attention rapt and experiencing it in the moment I can honestly say that I did not know what was going to happen next.If anyone has ever had that friend that you've know for years you know you have feelings for them appreciate their loyalty and take their bad with their good because after all you're just friends but have spent years keeping an eye out for something better or just not taken that next step because of geography peerpressure or fear of rejection you will appreciate the honesty and sentiment of this story.You'll definitely get a refresher course in the fact that life is indeed short and a lot can happen when you're not paying attention. Enjoy every moment you can and take some risks or you'll be looking back on an awful lot of regret. A Lot Like Love is funny and sad playful and poignant and was over before I wanted it to be. For me this movie is a lot like life.".

You actually fall into to the story as someone you might have known in life whether it was a friend or someone that remains in your thoughts from years past.To knickpick the movie on plot or commercialization is to miss the writers passion for what heshe is trying to convey.

Wow can you imagine people nowadays feeling that way?! I personally find it 'distressing' to think that we live in a society where having traditional desires is made to be odd.

The problem with the movie was that you don't have enough time to really bond with the characters and even though this isn't an amazing movie it is still a good movie and i enjoyed it. The songs in the movie really did help with the mood. This movie did have much more potential but the writing wasn't as good as it could have been.

	schema:reviewBody "The other obvious movie that comes to mind while watching 'A Lot Like Love' is Rob Reiner's classic 'When Harry Met Sally'. Both deal with friendship turn into romantic relationship over the years. One key difference is that this film does not focus on whether sex ends the friendship between a man and a woman. Here the two characters already have had a physical relationship from the start. It's the camaraderie that gradually develops. The physical attraction is there from the beginning and the friendship that follows only begs for the two to be together only they don't realize it. Also 'A Lot Like Love' is more modernized and the two lead characters Oliver and Emily are very different from Harry and Sally. Even though it misses reaching the standard of that classic by a bit it remains enjoyable and manages to bring a smile. Director Nigel Cole's intentions are noble but I thought he could have done a better job with the execution. While he solely focuses on the lead pair the supporting characters hardly have anything to do. In addition to that the pacing isn't consistent and the ending feels abrupt. It is the casting of Emily and Oliver that is the biggest strength. Both Amanda Peet and Ashton Kutcher share the required chemistry and do an outstanding job. The supporting cast that includes familiar names like Ali Larter Gabriel Mann and Kal Penn have too little to do to make an impression. Only Kathryn Hahn has a meatier role and she does a fine job. On the whole 'A Lot Like Love' is a very entertaining romantic comedy a great date movie for sure.".

In baseball you have three strikes and you're out. They wanted to play the game that way but could never seem to never figure it out. Over the course of seven years you fall in love watching Oliver Ollie Martin Ashton Kutcher and Emily Friehl Amanda Peet's acquaintanceship turn into a friendship then turn into a relationship. But whenever something remotely beings to happens a disturbance occurs and we are left at step one. Will their feelings overcome it all or will it all fall apart like each time they tried through the past seven years? Direction under Nigel Cole won't tell you much. He has directed very few films including Calendar Girls in 2003 and Saving Grace in 2000. Periodically he has directed television series between 1982 and 1998. Cinematographically this was well done and interesting. Camera movement was consistent and advanced. I came across great angles with nice transitions making the movie more enjoyable. The acting in this movie was stunningly one of the strongest features of it all. The interaction between Kutcher The Butterfly Effect Guess Who and PeetIdentity The Whole Nine Yards was unexpected and almost mindblowing. As for all of you chemistry students out there for the record Kutcher and Peet had excellent chemistry between the two. It would be very difficult to costar with Kutcher and pull it off as well as Peet did. The appearances of other big names really supported the acting foundation. The best friends Kathryn Hahn Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and Kal PennHarold  Kumar Go To White Castle Malibu's Most Wanted were great supporting actors. Also Ali Larter Final Destination Taryn Manning Crossroads Gabriel Mann The Life of David Gale and Jeremy Sisto Clueless added their unique spice to the movie. On a more negative note there were times when I found myself thinking What are the odds? It's not everyday that events like this happen to average Joe.I know I know it's a movie but some things in this motion picture were a little unrealistic and immaturefor a movie. In addition some of the writing though in a normal sense for everyday life seemed wrong for the occasion or event at the time. For what it was worth all together it was shaping. I feel as though the Motion Picture Association of America MPAA stretched the rope on this rating. This PG13 seemed dangerously close to a higher rating. There was sexual content nudity and language with a significant amount of drinking and drug content. Although the rating was suitable it was a higher level of PG13. Like many other teeny bopper chick flicks this movie can be compared to a group of other movies. If you liked Whatever It Takes Can't Hardly Wait Spanglish or Brown Sugar you may become attached to this motion picture. If you are looking for a great date movie I would recommend this film. It has proportioned humor romance and drama for any teenage audience. The guys will like it too! If you've ever experienced loveor some form of lovethis movie will particularly strike you.".

These two have fantastic chemistry together  they let each other shine without burning out the others' light. Oliver and Emily meet by chance on a flight and through the years they run back to each other for comfort in various times of need. Oliver goes off to Seattle to open his big business adventure and ends up in bankruptcy. He moves back home with his family to restart his life then he walks by a gallery and finds the photo that Emily took of him and her on the rock that night in the park. It is a great moment for him to realize how much he is in love with her. He shows up at her doorstep guitar in hand and is singing the Bon Jovi hit classic 'I'll Be There For You' which I will add that Ashton can actually sing a decent note! The classic moment that seals their fate was when she comes to his parents home and what she thinks is his wedding she turns around and walks right into the glass door  HYSTERICAL! Oliver then chases after Emily and she is feeling confused hurt and thinks it is too late but alas it is Oliver's Sister's wedding not his....Oliver kisses her in the very romantic way to steal your heart...The first time I watched this movie I thought for sure they were together in real life that is how much their chemistry worked ".

Emily Amanda Peet is being dropped off at the airport by her boyfriend both of them feuding in an obvious breakup. Oliver Ashton Kutcher is watching this and immediately mesmerized by this young lady. Both are on their way to New York for family reasons but both live in the L.A. area. This is their story of their hit and miss relationship over those 7 years.SPOILERS FOLLOW. On the flight not even knowing each others' names Emily joins Oliver in the plane's restroom for wild sex. He kinda likes her she just sees him as a fling. They next have a chance encounter in NYC. They go to a bar. He explains that he is going to ride the wave of the future on the internet gives her his parents' phone number tells her to call in 6 years and bet 50 that he would be a big success. About 3 years after New Year's eve her boyfriend just moved out she calls and finds him they click but he is moving to San Francisco for his internet diaper company. He gives her his camera as he goes she an aspiring actress turns to photography. In the end his internet company fails they hook up again it seems a lot like love.".

During their second meetingthey behave like retarded children in a restaurant spitting water at each other  such fun!!! then she gets drunk and vomit in his toilet there again. Every other time they meet either one has just been dumped by a partner. Actually it is hard to blame the partner for the dumping since one wonders how they could have attracted anybody but each other in the first place.

Basically go see this if you are in the mood for a romantic comedy and don't have too high expectations.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw A Lot Like Love this past week at a preview. It was a good romantic comedy that deals with the whole issue of good friends dating and how timing is so important in relationships. The movie goes through 7 or so years in the lives of Oliver Ashton Kutcher a motivated business guy that has his whole life planned at age 20 and Emily Amanda Peet a rebelliouswild girl who doesn't know what she's doing with her life. All through their 20s Oliver and Emily go through changes that most 20 somethings encounter  switching jobs cities boyfriendsgirlfriends and keep turning to each other for stability but one of them is always dating somebody else. Every time that something difficult happens in one of their lives they call or go see the other they live in different cities.Ashton plays a more subduedthoughtful character than he usually does and Peet plays a wild girl and its cool to see how their characters change their hair their clothes and their feelings over the years. Peet is really good as Emily the tough girl who has always had a man in her life is trying to figure out her place in the world. Her character is both vulnerable and stubborn. Ashton fans will also enjoy seeing him here  he's really kind of charming. The chemistry between Ashton and Peet is great a cute couple. One great scene is when they are singing together on a long car ride and other great scenes show how they support each other after a tough break up or a death in the family or losing a job. It all seems very genuine you recognize parts of you or your friends in the characters.Lots of people you recognize from other movies make appearances. Kal Penn Kumar from Harold  Kumar is Ashton's best friend. Ali Larter Gabriel Mann and Jeremy Sisto Billy from Six Feet Under. This is a very enjoyable romantic comedy.".

His absentee father only returns to visit when it is convenient.  When he does return the boy who idolizes him for a time does everything to please him but is generally treated with indifference.

You've got your mother's southern blood he tells his son.  Wilhelm brings a 17yearold girl Nunziata with him on his return and marries her. They have a child.   Arturo has feelings for the girl himself She is closer to his age rather than his father and the complex stirrings of love are made more confusing here by the fact that he must treat her as a stepmother.   Unable to fulfill his sexual yearnings with Nunziata this stepmother rejects the boy Antonio finds solace in the person of Teresa  an island prostitute who takes him to bed and initiates the boy into sex. Complicating the situation is the character of Tonino a criminal just released from prison and with whom the clearly bisexual dad Wilhelm is having a sexual relationship.As time goes on the callousness of the father and the boy's violent confrontation with dad's shabby male lover takes its toll on the boy with some elements analogous to what we have seen recently in the Russian film THE RETURN.  The boy rejects the father leaves for the mainland presumably with the sense of isolation and loneliness left behind him as he seeks a happier life on his own while moving into adulthood. The movie directed with his characteristic skill with actors by Damiano Damiani is a very satisfying little piece passed on a novel of Elsa Morante.  The music by Carlo Rustichelli and the haunting photographic images of Procida by photographer Roberto Gerardi help immensely.  Vanni De Maigret as young Antonio seethes with adolescent energy poutiness and is perfectly cut for the role.  For much of the movie he is a shirtless embodiment of youthful sexuality and yearning.  Reginald Kernan as Wilhelm the model of nonideal parenthood is fine as are the women in the cast.This film which played almost nowhere after its initial unsuccessful release and had scant distribution thereafter has receded into almost total oblivion apart from some latenight TV showings many years ago.  A shame because there is much to appreciate here.".

The music by Carlo Rustichelli and the haunting photographic images of Procida by photographer Roberto Gerardi help immensely.  Vanni De Maigret as young Antonio seethes with adolescent energy poutiness and is perfectly cut for the role.  For much of the movie he is a shirtless embodiment of youthful sexuality and yearning.  Reginald Kernan as Wilhelm the model of nonideal parenthood is fine as are the women in the cast.This film which played almost nowhere after its initial unsuccessful release and had scant distribution thereafter has receded into almost total oblivion apart from some latenight TV showings many years ago.  A shame because there is much to appreciate here.";

The movie seethes with subliminal and explicit homo erotic content in a way that I think was a ahead of its time. The black and white photography is very moody and the performances command attention. The influence of Italian neorealism is very present. It has that distinctive style of some 50s drama where the scenes develop without much explanation moving the story forward. When the young gangster arrives on the island you know something is going on without having been given all the usual clues you find in American movies.".

	schema:headline " Sergio Leone's first classic spaghetti western masterpiece and the best one of Clint Eastwood!";
	schema:reviewBody "A Fistful of Dollars 1964 in my opinion is the second best one in the spaghetti western series that is Sergio Leone's first best masterpiece in Dollars Trilogy that started all. It is my personal favorite western movie of all time. I love this movie to death and I will always cherish it. A lot of people are going for The Good the Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West and of course Eastwood's Unforgiven as their best favorite western films. But no one talks about this one A Fistful of Dollars which in my opinion is a classic  Sergio Leone's first masterpiece! This was the third Clint Eastwood's western film that I saw as a kid and I loved it every since. What can I say? Except I love this movie and it is my second favorite Clint Eastwood western movie. This one is in my top 5 Eastwood western films. I just love this movie to death and I love the story and the actors that it is in this film.This movie is shorter for only an hour and 39 minutes long which is not boring it is fast paced and it is filled with classic moments. A Fistful of Dollars is a classic and I can always watch and enjoy it without been bored. Clint Eastwood stars as the greatest Western character of all time ever created  The Man With No Name in the greatest Western of all time. The story is an unofficial reworking of the Akira Kurosawa film Yojimbo from 1961. What I love about this film is Clint Eastwood's character who helps out a young family who is torn apart from the Rojo's gang he make sure that the kid goes in to his mom's arms Eastwood was a heart in this movie. Also you have nice shootouts Eastwood wears a boiler plate as a bullet proof vest while Ramn Rojo Gian Maria Volont fires his Winchester '92 rifle at The Man With No Name brilliant! Than The Man With No Name kills them all with his colt excellent! Ramn fires the Mitrailleuse machine gun killing dozen of Mexican Soldiers awesome! Gian Maria Volont as Ramn Rojo was a terrific villain and he did awesome job. The plot start's faster and it is a stone cold classic that started all. Clint Eastwood is the coolest actor in the role playing the famous character of all time that made him an icon. Every second on screen he chews up the scenery and even today remains as bad ass as ever. Eastwood's character has been mimicked and copied numerous times over the years and yet he still stands up to modern scrutiny. Despite the character being so cool there is still humor to be found like the fact that he ALWAYS has that cigar in his mouth even when he's lying in bed. You also have the classic Mule scene which manages to be bad ass and funny at the same time. Sergio Leone directs everything to perfection and considering the film is from 1964 it's extremely well paced with plenty of action. The score was provided by Ennio Morricone who for some reason is credited as Dan Savio. The music is another element that has been copied by practically every other Western since. It set the standard of what a Western could be and once you watch the film the tune will go through your head for hours. Not only that this movie is a classic but two movies ripped off the story from this film Bruce Willis's Last Man Standing 1996 which completely ripped off the story from this film and Sukiyaki Western Django 2007.This is the beginning of the Man With No Name series. The visuals are beautiful the character of the Man With No Name menacing and mysterious the score is brilliant and the action is a blast. The greatest spaghetti western ever. The one that launched a thousand copycat versions even the wonderful score by Ennio Morricone. A Fistful of Dollars is a legendary with bullets as loud as the explosions and close ups extreme. The plot is simple though not as much as the sequel A Few Dollars More but that is what enables Sergio to weave a masterpiece. Iconic score. A Fistful of Dollars gets a perfect 10 by me and remains my all time best favorite Eastwood Western movie in the series that I absolutely love to death and I love Clint Eastwood's character. It's a genre that doesn't get enough love and it really should as it deals with all the familiar elements of action films like this one is.".

	schema:reviewBody "ALthough in many respects this film pales in comparison with Leone's later films it is itself a brilliant cinematic achievement. In part this is because its failings primarily appear to be due to constraints of budget very small and highly uncertain and time more than anything else. Even to the extent that the skills of Leone Morricone and others hadn't fully flowered yet this film is incredible at how brilliantly it is handled for what is really a firsttime go. Leone had worked on and even directed films before but this is his first real foray in his own direction and into a genre that he revolutionised and with which he became forever synonymous. Who can imagine westerns without at least thinking of Leone's films while who can think of Leone without thinking of westerns even though his last and arguably greatest film was a sort of gangster film? Similarly one should not criticize this film for being based on Yojimbo for that film itself was based on an American story while A Fistful of Dollars really is very different in many key respects not least of all Leone's visual style or his own sense of irony and symbolism derived from Italian precedents and Hollywood westerns.We also see the nascent Leone visual style here with the closeup style and contrast of closeups and long shots appearing. This alone sets it apart from previous films westerns and nonwesterns alike and still provides for great visual treats that one can appreciate today.This film also ushered in Leone's obsession with details hard faces grungy people etc. that also revolutionsed the genre.This films also marks the first brilliant score of Ennio Morricone. It is here that he introduced the lonely whistling guitar music chorus and unusual combinations and styles that developed into the music that has become in the U.S. synonymous with westerns and duels in the same way that Leone's visuals and themes have. Despite its minor flaws this is still a great film that is not only revolutionary but still great and fun to watch even today. Like Leone's other films it is timeless. One must also admit that it is amazing that in the U.S. an Italian film maker basing his films partly in Italian culture and an Italian composer could come to so define and be synonymous with this genre that Americans had considered so uniquely American and highlight its underlying universality. That alone reveals the greatness of the films of which this is the first.".

This alone sets it apart from previous films westerns and nonwesterns alike and still provides for great visual treats that one can appreciate today.This film also ushered in Leone's obsession with details hard faces grungy people etc. that also revolutionsed the genre.This films also marks the first brilliant score of Ennio Morricone. It is here that he introduced the lonely whistling guitar music chorus and unusual combinations and styles that developed into the music that has become in the U.S. synonymous with westerns and duels in the same way that Leone's visuals and themes have. Despite its minor flaws this is still a great film that is not only revolutionary but still great and fun to watch even today. Like Leone's other films it is timeless. One must also admit that it is amazing that in the U.S. an Italian film maker basing his films partly in Italian culture and an Italian composer could come to so define and be synonymous with this genre that Americans had considered so uniquely American and highlight its underlying universality. That alone reveals the greatness of the films of which this is the first.";

	schema:reviewBody "'A Fistful Of Dollars' is a wonderful movie which despite having an enormous following of fans around the world sometimes gets unfairly dismissed in my opinion. For two reasons  firstly because the second and third movie in LeoneEastwood Man With No Name trilogy 'For A Few Dollars More' and 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly' are so damn good it's easy to overlook this one. Despite being made on a much tighter budget and being less ambitious than the sequels to follow it's still one of the greatest westerns ever made in my opinion. The second reason is the Yojimbo thing. Now movie buffs frequently slam 'A Fistful Of Dollars' as being a rip off of Kurosawa's 'Yojimbo' which I think is extremely misleading. I'm not disputing that Leone was familiar with Kurosawa I have no idea one way or the other but one name I rarely hear ANYONE mention is Dashiel Hammett. Hammett's hard boiled crime classic 'Red Harvest' was published THIRTY YEARS before 'Yojimbo' and features the same central premise of an antihero playing two rival groups off against each other. So if anyone deserves acknowledgement as uncredited inspiration for Leone AND Kurosawa it's Hammett. Anyway this is an absolutely brilliant movie and it launched Clint Eastwood a popular TV actor into being a major movie star and likewise put Sergio Leone on the map. I can't recommend 'A Fistful Of Dollars' highly enough it's pure entertainment and very very cool!".

He did this picture almost as a lark and then read that it had become one of the biggest hits in Europe and then when it was released in America it outgrossed even the most popular current American films and made Clint Eastwood both a star and a phenomenon. Its strange to me that the best films ever made about the American west should have been made by Sergio Leone an Italian who couldn't even speak English. Clint Eastwood said that all he knew in Italian was arrevadershi and all Leone knew in English was goodbye and yet these two combined to make an awesome film. As the poncho clad Man With No Name Eastwood created a role that hit us like a punch in the face and really redefined the definition of the true Western hero. Eastwood tore out pages and pages of the dialogue and reduced his character to the bare bones to make him more mysterious. Leone said that he clad Eastwood in that sweat stained serepe to give him a cloak of mystery and put the cheroot in his mouth as a pendant between his two cold eyes and it worked like a charm. He broke all the rules and redefined screen violence. I read that Leone wanted to make a blood and guts Western and show to the audience I want them to feel what the hell it is like to get shot and he does it! The scene where Clint is beaten to a pulp is one of the most graphic that you will ever see. It would have killed most other men!".

It is a remake of Akira Kurosawa's 'Yojimbo' and it comes also pretty close to that movie. It was also the first real Spaghetti Western.Clint Eastwood is The Man with No Name who comes to a small town where two families run the place. Both families hate each other and he thinks he can make a lot of money with playing both parties against each other. This is basically the main story. There are some subplots one of them involves Marisol Marianne Koch who is taken by a leader of one of the families. Her husband and child still live in the town.For me it was not the story that made this movie interesting. It was the whole atmosphere. I like all Leone's westerns for that reason. Of course some are better than others but they are never boring. The way we see Eastwood kill four man early in the movie is simply spectacular.This no 'Once Upon a Time in the West' or even 'The Good the Bad and the Ugly' but we have the same atmosphere the same kind of score by Ennio Morricone and a Clint Eastwood at the beginning of a great career.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Per un pungo di dollari or A Fistful Of Dollars was released in the mid1960s the term Spaghetti Western was coined as a putdown to these brazen new films that dared to recreate the Wild West in a place as far away as Italy. However the last laugh was shared by the Italian directors whose new style of portraying Colonial America in a realistic style rather than the romanticised way that was characteristic of John Wayne and his contemporaries will be remembered long after the films of the romanticised style are no more.The plot is indescribably simple as Clint Eastwood simply wanders into a town where gang warfare has stripped the economy to the point where only the local undertaker makes a profit and turns the two warring families against one another. Sergio Leone's bestknown trademark his dynamic use of widescreen ratios comes to the fore here as Clint shares a film frame with no less than four of his enemies all of whom have plenty to say to him and vice versa. This is one film where a pan and scan transfer is purely and simply vandalism. Some of the dialogue that is included here absolutely takes the cake for cleverness and wit too. Asking four gunslingers to apologise to a horse well if it wasn't a man as famous for playing a gunslinger as Clint Eastwood it'd be ridiculous.Transplanting old Samurai legends into the Wild West works well as you can see here. Simply having an old mercenary who travels the land in search of wrongs to right and battles to be fought makes the story a lot more compelling than the Westerns where we are told every iota of the characters' motivations in the hope that it will give them some depth. The element of the main hero not getting involved in every scuffle that the bad guys cause our seminameless hero's ignoring a drunken thug shooting at a little boy being the most obvious example was another master stroke one that got Eastwood involved in doing the film to begin with. The confrontation at the end of the film works well too with pyrotechnics exploding all over the picture in a bright display that keeps the film powerful and yet focused at the same time.All in all Per un pungo di dollari gets nine out of ten from me. The lack of any interesting support characters does dull the story a little but this mistake was quickly rectified in the two sequels. The addition of Lee Van Cleef also worked well but in this effort it's all Clint Eastwood and while the rest of the cast are nowhere near as interesting it's all a better watch than anything the Americans were lumping out at the time.".

Neither gang is aware of his double play and each thinks it is using him. A mysterious gunfighter has strange plans and he will outwit them both.

A stranger appears out of nowhere and quickly adapts to a smuggling game in a small town. It sounds familiar but again that is very interesting and exciting. The atmosphere is cold and morbid while the characters are dirty evil and greedy. Simply it had to come to the moral redemption at one point. After this turning point in the story we finally can make some sort of distinction between good and evil in this movie.Mr. Leone has skilfully disguised relationships between the protagonists so it is very difficult to determine interests or emotions in this film. Of course all those who has watched Yojimbo will try to connect the dots. A few supporting characters will bring a little humor and empathy in an cruel conflict.Clint Eastwood as the Stranger is ruthless cruel and yet realistic and fascinating at the same time. Mr. Leone has set up a trap in his character. How will the audience react to a charming and exciting antihero? I guess we all know the truth. Mr. Eastwood has created an iconic character in which humor bursts through an ice seriousness.The sound effects are superb. I am delighted with the soundtrack. Closeups in addition to an unique style give a tension and severity of a coming conflict. I do not justify an enormous amount of violence in this film but again I think that westerns do not need to be a sweet fun for the whole family. This subgenre has brought something new.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Fistful Of Dollars marked the start of the spaghetti western genre and launched Clint Eastwood's career. Until this film Eastwood had been a bit player in numerous forgettable potboilers and the star of the modest TV western Rawhide. But his ultracool performance in this atmospheric western really sealed his long and lucrative future. The film also marked the emergence of Sergio Leone as a masterful director  the ultimate evidence of his talent coming a few years later with the stunning Once Upon A Time In The West. Here Leone uses a dazzling array of closeups and long shots and fits the terrific Ennio Morricone score around the action with considerable skill.The simplistic plot is basically a borrowing of the Japanese movie Yojimbo. A tough stolid resourceful drifter named Joe Clint Eastwood arrives in the border town of San Miguel. He learns that the town is controlled by two feuding families  the Baxters and the Rojos. One one side John Baxter Wolfgang Lukschy acts as the town's ineffective and respectless sheriff on the other side the Rojos have murdered and bullied their way to mockaristocratic status under the guidance of the psychopathic Ramon Rojo Gian Maria Volonte. Aided by a reluctant bartender and a considerably overworked coffin maker Joe cunningly plays each side off against each other. For each family he carries out various killings and other such dirty jobs pocketing increasing amounts of money for his lethal services while showing no loyalty to either party. But his plans come unstuck when he learns that Ramon has taken a girlfriend named Marisol Marianna Koch against her will forcing her to leave her husband and son and forbidding her from seeing them again. That kind of bullying Joe just won't stand for.....Dripping with atmosphere and suspense A Fistful Of Dollars was a totally new slant on the tired western genre in 1964. The minimalist plot actually becomes a strength rather than a weakness lending the film an air of enigmatic mystery reportedly Eastwood at his own insistence had his scant dialogue cut further in order to make Joe come across as the archetypal man of mystery. Gian Maria Volonte is excellent as the villain giving a performance of real menace and cruelty as the despicable Ramon Rojo. And Ennio Morricone's simple but energetic score has since become an iconic piece of western movie music. A Fistful Of Dollars is an important western milestone. Admittedly it steals its story from elsewhere and is full of farfetched gunfights but it oozes style and is so cleverly put together that its influence on subsequent movies is almost beyond measurement.".

Spaghetti Western was originally an insult coined by US critics who were offended by the temerity of Italian filmmakers in daring to tackle this quintessentially American genre but later became a more neutral description of Westerns made in Europe. Actually as most of these films were ItalianSpanish coproductions and many of them were filmed in Spain the title Paella Western would have been just as appropriate.This was also the film that made a major star of Clint Eastwood. It was the first film in Sergio Leone's dollars trilogy Eastwood was to star in the other two For a Few Dollars More and The Good the Bad and the Ugly. His character in all three films is billed as The Man with No Name although here that is not quite accurate as he is referred to in the film itself as Joe and represents a new breed of Western hero.Most previous Western heroes as played by the likes of John Wayne Alan Ladd or Gregory Peck were heroic in both senses of the word. They were not only physically courageous but also morally virtuous standing up for ideals of honour and justice against the villains. Some films had heroes who were morally flawed such as Howard Kemp James Stewart's character in The Naked Spur but the films themselves still took a moralistic line with these flaws condemned as moral weaknesses. By the end of The Naked Spur Kemp has undergone redemption though a change of heart.The Man with No Name by contrast was deliberately presented as an amoral antihero. He is courageous but does not stand for any idealistic moral principles. He is occasionally capable of altruism but most of the time is motivated by selfinterest. He is a hardbitten mercenary laconic loner. Eastwood also gave him a distinctive physical appearance characterised by his trademark poncho and cigar. He also sports a beard or stubble whereas most earlier Western heroes had been cleanshaven.The plot of For a Fistful of Dollars is said to be based upon the Japanese film Yojimbo although I cannot comment as I have never seen that film. Joe arrives in the Mexican border town of San Miguel. The town is dominated by two rival families the Rojos and the Baxters who make their money out of a lucrative trade in smuggling contraband into the US. Joe a skilled gunfighter sees this as a business opportunity and plays the two sides off against one another undertaking various jobs for both families while showing loyalty to neither. His mistake comes however when he for once performs a good deed. Ramon the most violent of the Rojo brothers has taken as his mistress a young married woman named Marisol forcing her against her will to abandon her husband and young child. Joe helps her and her family to escape and Ramon vows vengeance.A Fistful of Dollars is one of those films which is perhaps better remembered for its influence on later films than for its intrinsic merits. It is one of the first revisionist Westerns marking the start of a trend towards not only moral ambiguity but also a more realistic depiction of violence shown not only in the shootouts more messy and less cleancut than those in many previous films but also in the scenes where Joe is tortured by Rojos' thugs. This revisionist line was to become commonplace in the Westerns of the late sixties and early seventies Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch is a good example of a film which shows the influence of Leone's work.The film was originally shot without sound with a soundtrack being dubbed on later. This was common practice in the Italian film industry and this time as it allowed versions to be produced in different languages for the home and foreign markets. Even in English the film is sometimes referred to by its Italian title Per un Pugno di Dollari. The dubbing however is not always convincingly done and it is all too obvious that some of the characters are mouthing words which bear no relation to what we actually hear. The action is also at times overleisurely and difficult to follow. Although Eastwood shows the talent and charisma which would make him a major star the film today seems little more than a runofthemill Western. Nevertheless in the sixties it must have seemed to American audiences like something fresh and exciting. 610".

In fact there were a number of EuroWesterns made prior to Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars. However in comparison with Leone's first Western the few EuroWesterns I've seen tend to be little more than copies of American Westerns. Instead Leone was first to usher in a new style of Western. Leone created a less romanticized Western where characters had faults got dirty and bled. A Western where the line between the good guys and the bad guys was blurred. A Western where events were unpredictable. A Western where the violence was overthetop. The Spaghetti Westerns like A Fistful of Dollars may have had little in common with the real Old West but neither did the Hollywood Western. And I'm not sure that Leone and the rest cared that their films lacked historical accuracy. The real West wasn't their inspiration  the Hollywood Westerns were their inspiration. These were entertainment pieces first and foremost. And if the audiences of the 1960s were entertained by this new style Western Leone was going to give it to them.It's impossible to mention A Fistful of Dollars and not discuss the genius of Sergio Leone. In this movie you can see early examples of directorial flourishes that would become Leone trademarks. The extreme closeups followed by enormous widescreen shots the extended showdowns and the use of music as an integral part of a film can be seen in his first Western effort. But just as amazing and genius as Leone and just as important to the success of A Fistful of Dollars is Ennio Morricone's score. I'm sure audiences familiar the Hollywood style of scoring were shocked by Morricone's music with its series of whistles chirps and other experimental sounds. It was a new sound for a new kind of Western. And it's brilliant.At its core A Fistful of Dollars is a very simple movie. The plot is simple and even more so if you've seen Yojimbo. Clint Eastwood rides into town and discovers two warring factions. He uses the animosity they have for each other for his own gain. Like I said it's simple. But the film's simplicity extends beyond the plot. Partially for budgetary reasons and partially the result of some judicious cutting and editing there's very little in the way of fat. For example the dialogue in A Fistful of Dollars is often very minimal. Considering the fact that he's the lead performer Clint Eastwood's character has very few lines. Instead Leone and Eastwood allow a look an action or a note from Morricone's incredible score to speak for Clint. Simple?  yes but very effective.Beyond Leone's direction Morricone's score and the style of the Spaghetti Western A Fistful of Dollars excels in several other areas  especially the acting. For the budget the film was made on the acting is superb. Eastwood and his minimalist Man with No Name may be the known quantity but there are other equally impressive performances in the movie. Chief among them is Gian Maria Volont as the crazed Ramon. It's an amazing piece of work. As much as I enjoy Eastwood it's Volont that makes the movie for me.Finally and I'll end here because I could probably go on writing all night I sometimes wonder if Leone or Eastwood or anyone involved with A Fistful of Dollars had any idea of what they were doing. Did they have any notion that more than 40 years later these movies would be more beloved than when they were made? I sincerely doubt it. I'll never forget the night I discovered Leone's Dollar Trilogy. I was in college in the early 80s and WGN was playing A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More backtoback. I was blown away! My conception of what a Western was changed that night. And I've been a huge fan every since.Thank you Mr. Leone.".

The first movie of its kind it rose the Italian Western to an international level and if it had not been for Per Un Pugno Di Dollari the great genre of the Spaghetti Westerns would probably never have become what it is.Based On Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece Yojimbo of 1961 A Fistful Of Dollars is not a simple remake but a masterpiece based on another masterpiece something very rare in film history that definitely has its very own style. There is no doubt for me that both Kurosawa and Leone are two of the most important and brilliant directors of all time. I love Yojimbo as I love Per Un Pugno Di Dollari and I could not say which one I prefer.The movie that made the Italian Western what it is made Clint Eastwood a star as an actor and Sergio Leone a star as a director. It also made Ennio Morricone famous who is arguably the most brilliant film score composer of all time and it basically created the Western Anti Hero.A cigar smoking stranger the Man With No Name Clint Eastwood comes to San Miguel a small town in the MexicanAmerican borderland which is terrorized by two rival gangs of outlaws lead by two families the Baxters and the Rojos. He plays the two families against each other in order to free the town his secondary reason and earn a lot of money his primary reason.Clint Eastwood's performance as the Man With No Name Joe in the credits is superb. I can't remember any actor who has achieved the coolness of Clint Eastwood in the Dollar Trilogy and I don't think any actor Ever will. But Clint Eastwood is not the only one who delivers an outstanding performance in A Fistful Of Dollars. The great Gian Maria Volont plays the crazy and villainous Ramn Rojo with brilliance Volont represents insanity and evilness equally believable and superb as Eastwood represents Coolness.The supporting cast is also great the beautiful Marianne Koch fits perfectly in the role of Marisol a young mother who is held captured by Gian Maria Volont's character Ramn Rojo who is in love with her. The supporting cast furthermore includes such great Spaghetti Western actors as Mario Brega Aldo Sambrell and Benito Steffanelli actors who have gained fame amongst Spaghetti Western fans for roles such as those in A Fistful of Dollars.It is Ennio Morricone's iconic brilliant score that gives this movie perfection. Morricone's scores are one of the most essential things about Sergio Leone's films see A Fistful Of Dollars and you'll know what I mean.A Fistfull Of Dollars is a superbly directed violent film about selfishness greed and hatred full of black humor and spiced up with great dialogue. A masterpiece that is only excelled by its two successors Per Qualche Dollaro In Pi aka. For A Few Dollars More and Il Buono Il Brutto Il Cattivo. aka. The Good The Bad And The Ugly which is my favorite movie of alltime A Fistful Of Dollars is one of the movies that in my opinion everybody has to see. Brilliant and timeless Per Un Pugno Di Dollari is a masterpiece that seems to get better each time I see it. Essential! 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Well I was late to see this movie. I only checked it out after I saw it on the top lists here. At the moment I didn't know it was a remake of Yojimbo by Akira Kurosawa. By a quirky coincidence I saw the latter movie only a day later and must say To call For a Fistfull of Dollars a remake is almost an understatement. It's a ripoff.The story is a total clone OK this is to be expected with a remake. The sets and camera angles are nearly identical and even the jokes are stolen. After this experience my appreciation of the western sharply dropped. This is too early to be a homage only 3 years later and too uninspired for a remake. Had the story and dialog been original I might have forgiven this movie it's small other failings soundtrack bad acting by everyone except Eastwood  and he's not really up to his usual standards here either. But the way it is there is really nothing to recommend the clone over the original.Still the original is brilliant. Detracting from that all I have said doesn't make For a Fistfull of Dollars a bad movie  merely a mediocre one.My advice If you have the choice go check out Yojimbo instead.510".

	schema:headline " A stylistic accomplishment that changed its genre and movies";
	schema:reviewBody "The Western genre changed forever with the release of Sergio Leone's landmark Spaghetti Western A Fistful of Dollars but not necessarily for reasons you might think when it comes to a movie deemed a classic.The story is weak most of the acting bordering on comical and there's no depth to speak of but the Akira Kurosawainspired style of A Fistful of Dollars makes it entertaining and a rather fascinating watch from a stylistic perspective. Leone did things with a camera that Hollywood hadn't seen before probably  I admit I wasn't there an approach that made the Western more entertaining yet more dramatic and tense.Clint Eastwood stars as Joe or more popularly The Man with No Name in the role that launched the Rawhide star's film career. When he comes upon the Mexican border town of San Miguel  where you either get rich or get killed  the anonymous gunslinger puts himself at the center of a bloody feud between the Baxters and the Rojos playing them off of each other for his financial gain. The Man with No Name is essentially the Western's first true anti hero. That's the primary contribution Fistful of Dollars makes to the genre  it pushes past the blackandwhite cowboy heroes and wanted bandits dynamic. Joe has one characterrevealing moment when he takes pity on a woman named Marisol Marianne Koch and her family who are captives in a sense of the Rojo brothers. Otherwise he's a troublemaker with money on his mind we just like the guy because he's a badass who is less slimy than the rest of the characters.The script annoyingly drifts between too overt and not explicit enough but eventually it becomes clear that the only dialogue worth paying attention to is the clever quips and that it doesn't matter how a point of tension or violence is reached but how it looks and feels when we get there.Leone isn't at the peak of his powers here by any stretch which should be obvious given this was his first foray into Western territory and second film ever but he gets enough right to open the door to a shift in thinking about how these movies are made. Fistful is an experimental playground for camera angles and various perspective shots. Cinematographers Massimo Dallamano and Federico Larraya play a lot with lighting incidentally creating Eastwood's trademark squint. You might argue that Leone and crew stumbled upon greatness and that this movie is a combination of stumbles and surefooted landings.The secret weapon is Ennio Morricone. The composer's score feels familiar to modern audiences but it's his creativity using raw sounds and singular instruments in striking patterns that ultimately redefined the genre. He brings the tension mystery and swagger to the film. He even recognizes when silence works better than anything he could write. In so many ways his music really glues this experiment of a movie together.Movies that rise to the top in spite of their weaknesses by means of style and creativity are extremely rare and they're usually an indicator of a film that's a gamechanger to the art form. A Fistful of Dollars qualifies. It's a film that is much more important than it is great.Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more".

	schema:reviewBody "Some people whose opinions I respect admire this movie but to tell the truth I could hardly get through it. I can't fathom its appeal. After the first scenes involving Eastwood protecting his mule's pride I expected it to be a continuing joke. It was kind of witty. My mule don't like you laughin' at him. Ennio Morricone's music helped establish it as some kind of comedy with that whistling flute and the dirgelike underscoring of the dramatic scenes. I didn't think the composer could take it seriously and I still don't. But I've come to believe that Sergio Leone thought he was making a good tense Western.In my view he was wrong. It's more of a caricature. It's based on Akira Kurosawa's samurai movie Yojimbo which was modeled after John Ford's work so A Fistful of Dollars is an Italian imitation of a Japanese imitation of an American Western.If Grandma Moses had been a director she might have come up with something like this. When Leone wants us to see someone's face we see someone's FACE. Right up close. So close you can smell the garlic see the glistening teeth. And when he REALLY wants us to see the face as during moments of extreme stress we see the face only from brow to philtrum. At this distance we see every bead of sweat every pore sprouting a bit of whisker. We are on a firstname basis with the nasolingual fold and you can see the Darwinian points quiver. Sometimes when Leone wants to indicate that a person is walking down the dusty street we see nothing but his boots and brutal spurs. When he stops walking the camera lingers on those items  as if there were three things of value in this world truth beauty and those boots.The acting is as overdone as the makeup except for Clint Eastwood who is made up impressively but doesn't act. Gian Maria Volont is the chief heavy. Near the opening we watch him shoot down dozens of Mexican troops with a machine gun the likes of which the earth has never known. It's water cooled and yet it's not. It has multiple muzzles like a Gatling gun yet nothing revolves. It appears to have the breach of a Browning but has two handles. We see the barrel firing from behind. We see Volont's maniacally grinning face as it shoots. Yet we never see the machine gun itself in action. That's because it's probably made of cardboard.Now I'm not a gun freak and I don't care whether the gun is real or not. What I'm pointing to is not the stupid fake gun but the general air of sloppiness that prevails throughout the movie.Eastwood didn't speak Italian and Leone didn't speak English. Not that it matters. Eastwood fresh from a long television Western series where every facial twitch registers like an earthquake was made for a directorial style like Leone's. As Leone was to say later Michelangelo claimed that he could look at a block of marble and see the man inside I looked at a man and saw the block of marble inside. Eastwood never did become much of an actor. He's not the type to emote and it limited his range. We remember him for one or two of his lines  Go ahead make my day. Yet in later years he's turned out some exceptionally good work as a director. A Fistful of Dollars is a Western. But so is Unforgiven. Compare the two.".

First when the Nawab overwhelmed by the political situation while in conference with his ministers seeks solace in a haunting graceful song he had composed in a happier time actually composed by Ray    perhaps the director showing us his selfidentification with the character. Second in a scene where Mir is left on his own at the chessboard while Mirza goes off to see what the trouble is with his wife the camera follows Mir as he gets up and goes out into the hallway to see where his friend has got to. The camera then stays still as he retraces his steps and in the vertical slice of light caused by a gap between two curtains that separate the hallway and the chess room we see framed the precise point on the chessboard where Mir's hand slowly and surreptitiously comes into view as he sneakily moves one of the pieces.

One narrative focuses on the political machinations of the bullish pragmatic representative of the British General Outram played capably by Richard Attenborough and the diffident response of the cultured but cloudheaded Indian Muslim King of Oudh played with great feeling by Amjad Khan. The other narrative shifts focus to the tragicomic situation of two wellborn Indian Muslim gentlemen played by the alwayswonderful Saeed Jafarey and Sanjeev Kumar and their obsession with a game of chess leading them to neglect the momentous tide of history which is about to sweep over them. Indeed not only is chess a metaphor for the power struggle between Indian and British but the two chess players' family situations are too with both men locked into domestic struggles with their wives the haughty beautiful Khurshid played with characteristic commitment by Shabana Azmi and the lascivious lying Nafisa wellplayed by Farida Jalal. The twin approach is useful and well integrated and there is even some humorous animation. Ray brings his characteristic eye for ravishing beauty balanced with his close sympathetic interest in humanity particularly when under pressure and a real feeling for the period. Also typical is the universality of the director's humanitarian outlook with the nominally Hindu Ray studying Muslims and the British with the same warm but cleareyed assiduousness.Overall this is a film like all of Ray's films to treasure not only for a person of Indian ancestry such as myself.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shatranj Ke Khilari is the first Hindi film by who is undoubtedly the best filmmaker India has ever had. Satyajit Ray made this movie in 1977 having established his reputation worldwide as an ace director with his Bengali art pieces.Based in mid 19th century this is an account of the British annexation of one of the last independent kingdoms of India Awadh. The British by that year have quite a firm hold on the subcontinent and are keen to swallow down everything that has not yet been under their direct control. So the East India Company and its representative General Outram decide that it was time for the ruling king Nawab Wajid Ali Shah to step down from his throne.Wajid Ali Shah the king is that only by name. He is an indifferent ruler whose days and nights are occupied not with the affairs of state but the artistic charms of music poetry and dance. He is a ruler who finds it convenient to leave the important matters regarding his kingdom to his subordinates while he indulges in life's countless pleasures. Inevitably the British sensing a weak king are tempted to take over the control of the province.Meanwhile two of the king's friends Mirza Sajid Ali and Mir Roshan Ali are busy satisfying their own personal urges. In a time when the king needs their help desperately they engage all day in the old Indian game of Chess. Oblivious and indifferent to what is happening to Lucknow and their own private household these chesscrazy men spend days challenging each other to games of a sport played with soldiers which are not real but wooden pieces which move on a small 64squared board. Their inconsequential moves on that board act as a substitute to the possible resistance they could have shown to the British takeover.It is extremely difficult to find flaws in such a movie. As with all Ray movies this movie doesn't have too much of a storyline to boast about. This is just a beautiful account which epitomizes the kind of inactivity and submission our country had sunk into in those times. The acting is as expected spotless. Everyone has done his part to perfection. The direction and camerawork are as good as any other Ray movie. The dialogues are as precise as we have got from movies like Umrao Jaan or MughalEAzam. Each and every line spoken is worth listening to again and again. As an added attraction Amitabh Bachchan has lent his voice for the narration which is something he has done quite well.The pace of the movie being slow it is of course not everyone's cup of tea. But this movie is a mustwatch for its brilliant acting and direction. And no other form of art can possibly be more expressive of the Indian mentality back in the 19th century.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shatranj Ke Khilari is Sayajit Ray's first Hindi movie. It is though a bit too slow at points special different comic and as a result unusually entertaining. This satirical drama is humorous interesting and impressive and Ray's direction is excellent. It is evidently well invested with glossy sets and costumes. The writing is superb with the brilliantlywritten dialogues surpassing the storyline itself and the culture and the atmosphere of those times is captured exceedingly well. All these aspects along with the music composed by Ray and the fantastic narration of Amitabh Bachchan create an engagingly artistic and poetic piece. Ray casts some of the most talented leading actors from the Hindi film industry all of whom suit their roles and do a wonderful job. Amjad Khan is great as Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. Sanjeev Kumar and Saeed Jaffrey are exceptional as the chessobsessed noblemen who ironically indulge in ceaseless chess playing while showing minimal interest in the state of their marriages wives and even their nation. Shabana Azmi and Farida Jalal play their neglected wives and they excel in their very tiny roles each has only a few minutes onscreen. Azmi is convincing as the frustrated Khurshid and Jalal is awesome as the unfaithful wife who has an affair with her husband's nephew Aqueel. Richard Attenbrough and Victor Banerjee provide great support. Shatranj Ke Khilari is a nice little film. It is not among the very best of Ray but it is certainly a worthy picture and of the most strikingly unique films of those times.".

	schema:headline " A delightful comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Two aristocrats oblivious to what is going on around them play chess around the clock while the British plan a takeover of a northeastern Indian kingdom. These threads are interwoven seamlessly in Satyajit Ray's delightful comedy The Chess Players recently released on a Kino DVD. The film does not spare either side from the thrust of its gentle dagger depicting both the apathy of the Indian upper classes and the arrogance of the colonial masters. Like many Satyajit Ray films there are gorgeous dance sequences and appealing musical numbers but unlike most the spoken language is Urdu not Bengali and it is a big budget film in Technicolor using name actors.Based on a short story by Prem Chand the film is set in Lucknow India in 1856 and is narrated by the real Amitabh Bachchan. As the film opens we learn that Oudh's King Wajid Ali Shah Amjad Khan has financed the British East India Company for ten years and also provided soldiers for its army. In exchange the Company did not interfere with Wajid's rule even though they viewed the king with disdain. This changed in 1856 when General Outram Richard Attenborough was instructed to depose the king and take over the kingdom to add to the British coffers. Outram the local representative of the Company justifies his ambitions for more territory by denouncing the king to an aide as an incompetent ruler and hedonist ignoring his devotion to dance poetry and music.In another thread two Indian aristocrats Mirza Sanjeev Kumar and Meer Saeed Jaffrey play chess obsessively to the dismay of their wives Khurshid Shabana Azmi and Nafisa Fardia Jalal. Mirza's wife feeling neglected steals and hides the chess pieces while Meer's wife has an affair with his nephew Farooq Shaikh. Unwilling to handle their domestic affairs the two first use fruits and vegetables as their set pieces then seek other places to play their game refusing to believe that the British takeover is imminent. One of their stops is the home of their attorney who is on his deathbed. This doesn't stop the two from hilariously trying to sneak in a game of chess in another room.The two players cling to their way of life exchanging frivolous banter and smoking hookah pipes while the world around them crumbles. They finally take refuge in the home of a young boy Kullu Samarth Narain who remained while others fled just to see the redcoated British soldiers march into the city. While perhaps not in the upper echelon of Ray's work The Chess Players is a very entertaining political satire that provides wry insight into human nature and our capacity for denial. General Outram is portrayed as a wellmeaning but totally condescending individual who utterly fails to understand the lives and culture of the people he seeks to control. Any resemblance to current U.S. MuddleEast policies of course is purely accidental.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being from a particular region in a country like India comes with its goods and not so goods. People from one part of the nation don't necessarily always know of the legendary works of art that happen in another place. Like people in Orissa being unaware of the deep rooted humanitarian movies that come out of the Tamil movie industry or folks in Kerala not aware of some genuinely wonderful pieces of cinema from West Bengal. One cant do too much about this divide given that the Herculean and almost obnoxious presence of 'Bollywood' continues to act as the fort that isolates several pockets of creative work in their own shells. Sad but true.Then there are some film makers whose movies transcend language and region. Film makers like the late Academy Award winner Satyajit Ray sa'ab. OK  I will admit. Except for a few brief scenes from 'Pather Panchali' I have not seen any other movie of this great man. Reason? Well either it was the lack of the need to have to sit through a language I know nothing of and having to squint at the badly framed English subtitles or it was just plain desi callousness that believes the majority is usually right. You know the classic Indian thinking that has the 'if everyone says it then it has to be great' attitude peppered all over it. I am sure there are millions out there who will still tell you that Satyajit Ray was an amazing movie maker without having seen a single frame he might have shot. Considering I too have indulged in such blatancy every now and then 'Shatranj Ke Khiladi' seemed like the only chance I would get to savor Mr. Ray's cinematic beauty. After all it was indeed the only HindiUrdu movie he made in his life isn't it? Hence when I found the chance I took it.Set in the late 1800s in the then Hindustan 'Shatranj Ke Khiladi' runs with two main stories parallel to one another. One  the larger of the two which shows a determinedly boorish English General Outram a much younger looking Sir Richard Attenborough pitted against Awadh's incompetent yet culturally aware Mughal King Wajid Ali Shah a generously rotund Amjad Khan. The company wants to take over Awadh which remains the final province that is still run by royalty. So it decides to look past a decade old treaty that had promised that Awadh's royalty would never be lost. But knowing the way the company ruled the subcontinent the poetically humane King's defiance is brought under test as the concubine infested regal refuses to budge from his throne.The second interestingly laid out strand is that of old buddies Mirza Sajjad Ali a wonderfully flawless Sanjeev Kumar and Mir Roshan Ali an effervescent Saeed Jaffrey. These two upper middle class noblemen who sit around all day sucking at their well made hookahs and ignoring their frustrated spouses are absolutely obsessed with the game of chess. It is as if nothing  not even the lack of pawns to play with  can stop them from going at it well and good for a few hours each day. While Sajjad Ali's wife Shabana Azmi is a small but well placed role decides to find solace in the housekeeper's stories Roshan Ali's wife a chubby and visibly mischievous Fareeda Jalaal chooses to find solace in the arms of a much younger man a nervous Farooque Shaikh right under the nose of her unsuspecting husband.Ray beautifully juxtaposes the story of two chess players with the moves that take over their province and their lives as a foreign power enters their land. While the King is confronted by the orders of the Union Jack under the umbrella of the soulful songs he has composed the chess players continue to find ways to get a good spot to sit down and well  play a good round of chess. A game as it turns out that ends up putting their friendship at stake just like the throne of their clueless King.The one thing that comes off as obviously as the attention to pretentious 'paan holders' by these Lucknawi laat saahebs is Ray's understanding of the human condition in those times. The beautiful focus to detail of the surroundings only amplify the saga that unfolds eventually while the red vested British army marches into the Awadh province. Cinematography is crisp and captures the fading lights of the royal reign quite effectively. What struck me as more amazing was Ray's wonderful acknowledgement to the way such potentially affluent cultures used to work during that era. The fact that people in them would rather spend more time on keeping their indulgences alive than worry about their future under the Raj was an eye opener to say the least.Performances wise everyone does hisher bit effectively. Seasoned actors Sanjeev and Saeed chip in a beautiful contribution. A young Amjad Khan still fresh from the finely baked success as 'Gabbar Singh' in Sholay delivers an earnest performance as the King who has his heart in the right place but his head in the wrong spot. As mentioned earlier a tight lipped Sir Attenborough with a fluent Tom Alter play the scheming Englishmen who are preparing for Awadh's fall with orders from Her majesty the Queen.All said and done 'Shatranj Ke Khiladi' definitely stands out as a Ray classic that is truly a testament to his life as a master story teller. I am glad that even if this is the only movie I will ever watch of Mr. Ray then at least it is based on a story by the legendary Shri Munshi Premchand. Could there be a better example of two Hindus coming together to design such a sensitive and relevant epic about the Muslim reign and culture? Unlikely according to me.".

One cannot expect any less from Satyajit Ray one of India's greatest filmmakers. Shatranj ke Khiladi is a satirical comedy that stars the best actors delivering the finest performances. Amjad Khan and Saeed Jaffrey definitely did their best for this movie. Sanjeev Kumar and Shabana Azmi are excellent as always. Richard Attenborough and Victor Banerjee do very well with their small roles. I was also surprised to see Farida Jalal in a negative comic role as an unfaithful wife. Ray also applies his artistic talents in set designs as you'll see some beautiful paintings. Background music is limited but used effectively. The movie was shot brilliantly where it is quite evident that the director has given attention to very little detail. There is one scene where Sanjeev Kumar goes to his room to see his wife. Saeed Jaffrey is waiting for him. We soon see a scene where Jaffrey goes to check on Sanjeev then when he returns...we see a hand changing the position on the chess board. This is just one of the finest example of excellent direction among the many you'll witness in this classic masterpiece. The events of the 19th century are portrayed very poetically. While some may say that the pace is slow it did not bore me one bit and there was always something happening. This indeed is a fine piece of filmmaking. I suggest you go and watch it.".

Especially the one to one talks of Mir and Mirza are great all are in Proper Urdu which is common in that era. From lighting the sunsets in the end to capturing the true emotions the way he showed the desperation of two wives is remarkable. Setting of the movie from the very first scene to the end is just amazing in a sense how he tackles different issues to recreate that era.Acting is pretty good from Mir and Mirza. Rest is just doing their part well.".

Especially the one to one talks of Mir and Mirza are great all are in Proper Urdu which is common in that era. From lighting the sunsets in the end to capturing the true emotions the way he showed the desperation of two wives is remarkable. Setting of the movie from the very first scene to the end is just amazing in a sense how he tackles different issues to recreate that era.Acting is pretty good from Mir and Mirza. Rest is just doing their part well.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Chess Players is a curious film by the famed Indian director Satyajit Ray. Half in Hindi and half in English which is curious in itself. The story is about the take over of the Kingdom of Oudh capital Lucknow by the British. It shows the complete deceit of the British in their takeover of the Indian Sub Continent using underhand methods based in their emasculation of the Indian rulers. The Nawab of Oudh is a cultured Muslim ruler in the tradition of The Moghuls. The qualities admired by the culture of the time were not militaristic and patriarchal but cultural and aesthetic. The Nawab often sang songs to his people and danced for them or read poetry and wrote it of course. This was considered by the British to show signs of effeminacy and not good government. I fact the subjects of the Nawab who were for the most part Hindus loved their Ruler for precisely these qualities and even though he was of a different faith lived happily in a cultural paradise. The British represented by Richard Attenborough show a total lack of understanding of this culture and in a cynical move annex the kingdom and send the Nawab into exile.There was interestingly enough no attempt at resistance but a bland acceptance of the will of God. Strangely sad and haunting film from one of India's greatest directors since Independence. Trivia. Lucknow was the city that Cliff Richard was born in and lived as a child before Independence.".

	schema:headline " A Pleasant Disappointment";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching 'Shatranj ke Khilari'The Chess Players by Satyajit Ray was a pleasant disappointment. Let me explain both 'pleasant' and 'disappointment' one by one. Without any doubt it's an excellent movie by all standards of movie making. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has an excellent script richly talented cast and consummately meticulous direction. However I was disappointed because this movie is based on a short story by one of the greatest writers of Hindi literature Munshi Premchand and...... I have read the story! But before getting into analyzing this movie in detail let's have the story. 'Shatranj ke Khilari' has rather two parallel stories. One is about King Wajid Ali Shah the last king of Oudh and the other is about two aristocrat friends Mirza Sajjad Ali and Mir Roshan Ali who share a terrific obsession with the game of Chess Shatranj. Events in the story take place in the year 1824 in the city of Lucknow  capital of the state of Oudh where patriotic values and national integrity have disappeared in the abyss of affluence. Three main characters are totally captivated by their own obsessions. King is obsessed with dances poetry and music completely ignoring administration. Similarly Mirza and Mir for their addiction of the game of Chess ignore their homes and their wives. Wife of Mirza continually throws tantrums to make her presence felt with little success while the wife of Mir has sought refuge in an extra marital affair with a distant nephew. Two stories run parallel. British administration which has a treaty with the State of Oudh denounces the treaty on the grounds that the king is an incompetent administrator and takes over reigns of Oudh. The King surrenders without protest. On the other hand two friends who have to run away from the city fearing that they would be compelled to fight for their country find a deserted and lonely place to play Chess. They engage into an argument where Mirza taunts Mir about his wife's infidelity and agitated Mir by mistake misfires a bullet at him. However their obsession with Chess is too much for any other feeling to take over. They resolve their differences and resign to their obsession and continue playing chess.What impressed me the most about the movie was language. This was the first nonBengali directorial venture of Satyajit Ray. Even though the language of the movie is mainly Urdu one cannot feel that director is not well verse with the language. Moreover people of different strata of the society have been shown speaking in different accents. Servants and people from countryside are shown speaking Oudhi a local dialect while aristocrats speak precise and exceptionally polite Urdu. It's a role model for a period movie. Sets costumes and outdoors speak richly about vivid architecture and interiors of households of Lucknow in early nineteenth century. The Movie also boasts of a very strong cast. Sanjeev Kumar and Saeed Jaffrey as Mirza and Mir respectively are brilliant. Amitabh Bachchan as invisible narrator is superb as ever. Richard Attenborough is also impressive. Even in smaller roles Ray has chosen some very powerful actors. However choosing Amjad Khan as the King is a masterstroke. The original story doesn't talk much about the King. Hence developing a full character of King Wajid was a tough job. But here director seems to have done extensive research on him. King Wajid Ali has a very important place in the history of Indian Arts. He is hailed as one of the most prodigious promoters of Thumri A form of classical music and Kathak A popular form of classical dance from northern India. In this paradoxical character Amjad portrays the masculinity of a King and effeminacy of a man dedicated to dance poetry and music with equal conviction. Music of the movie is also a plus. In most of the scenes one can listen to melodious thumris or other compositions of Indian classical music being played in the background.However as I mentioned before watching this movie was pleasant as well as disappointing. The first source of disappointment is the feeling that an opportunity to accommodate some more melodious music has been lost. Since King Wajid is one of the central characters of the movie there was definitely a greater opportunity for some more music and elegant dances.However the biggest disappointment comes from Ray's reinterpretation or misinterpretation of Munshi's story. At some places Ray has deviated from the original story. In the original story wife of Mir has an extra marital affair with an army officer. Munshi Premchand wanted to show that responsible people in army were also engaged in such activities ignoring the danger of a war with the British. For some unknown reasons Ray has shown that Mir's wife has an extra marital affair with a distant nephew. However the biggest alteration has been made in the climax of the story and this destroys the very patriotic essence of the story. In the original story both the characters Mirza and Mir end up killing each other. Munshi Premchand very categorically mentions twice that they did not lack 'personal valor' but didn't want to use qualities of courage and bravery for their nation. Munshi Premchand was a patriotic writer. He wanted to show that prosperity made the Indian elite lazy myopic and lackadaisical and fated India with foreign rule. On the other hand Ray kept them alive and actually portrays them as impotent people who accept their cowardice as a fact of life New York Times Review of the movie DT May 17 1978 wrote Ray Satirizes Indian Nobility Civilized Impotency. This is definitely not how Munshi meant it to be. In order to have a greater universal appeal and fetch more awards Ray killed the very patriotic soul of the story.I heartily wish that some day somebody would remake this movie and do justice to this wonderful story and Munshi Premchand.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie first a long time on television. I was a kid then and had no exposure of art movies much less of movies by Satyajit Ray. At that time I though of it as a typical art movie. Something to be admired but beyond my comprehension.Now Satyajit Ray has become my favorite filmmaker. I have seen 17 of his movies and loved 14 of them. They are just masterpieces. So I was eager to revisit this movie. First to appreciate it on its own and secondly to see how my perception has changed.My perception has definitely changed. I loved the costumes and the cinematography and could really appreciate them. It is Ray's most lavish movie. But I just wished that Subrata Mitra was still working with Ray. He is probably one of the best cinematographers in the history and the magic that he weaves in Ray's earlier movies is amazing. I still remember the dance sequences in Jalsaghar which were hypnotizing. They are good here also but nowhere in that league.The movie was a little disappointing for me. Surprising because I have loved all of Ray's dramatic movies I have seen till now. Ray is able to pull the viewer into the movie. Even Jalsaghar which had a lead character I didn't like  a fading Zamindar who was still maintaining his lavish lifestyle to his ruin just because of his pride made me empathize with him and ultimately cheer him. But here the characters are further away. I think the narrative needed somebody of Chhabi Biswas ability to portray the role of Wajid Ali Shah. Amjad Khan did a good job but not as per the complexity of the character and Ray's standard. Sanjeev Kumar has given a good performance too. In the end the movie still felt little like an art film somehow a little beyond my reach. I think part of it may be due to the fact that Ray may not have been comfortable in Hindi which was not his native language. He has made all except 2 of his movies in Bengali. But I think a larger part is due to the story itself.".

	schema:headline " end of a kingdom";
	schema:reviewBody "'The Chess Players' is the only film of Ray which ventures deep into a different culture  the one of the Muslim kingdom of Oudh and is spoken in the Urdu language. Filmed on location in Lucknow it describes the end of the last Muslim fief in India in 1856 going deep into the social and cultural causes of the fall of the kingdom. It is a work of great psychological and cinematographic beauty also the most expensive film ever made by Ray. The famous Indian writer V.S. Naipul was quoted comparing this film with a Shakespeare play and the comparison is not exaggerated.There are two apparently distinct threads in the film. One is the historical story of the deposing of the last king of Oudh Wajid Ali Shah played by Amjad Khan. He is described in the film as a fascinating mix of corruption and sensitivity of debauchery and resignation. Ray had ambivalent feelings to this character which is on one side a symbol of the decay of remains of the Mogul empire but on the other side has an internal dignity and continues a tradition and a way of life which is misjudged and completely misunderstood by his enemies. The opposing camp of the British is represented by general Outram Richard Attenborough the archetype of the colonial conqueror misjudging and downplaying the culture of his opponents. The dialogs between the two are fascinating. They use a translator and the translation is rigorously accurate. Yet the true meaning gets often lost in translation. The dialog between cultures needs to take place much above the dictionary.The second thread is the one of the chess players. Two friends belonging to the aristocracy of the kingdom spend all their time days and nights playing chess. They play it the old way they are proud that the game invented in India and not in Persia! spread all over the world and although they hear that the British had changed some rules they ignore the changes. By love for the game they ignore everything around  their affairs their wives the dangers that threaten their kingdom and mode of life. Chess becomes the central obsession of their lives and the central obsession of the film a symbol of the tradition and refinement of their civilization but also of the obsession and refuse to face the reality that leads to its loss. While spending time in fighting each others king they fail to protect the real king and his kingdom. Sanjeev Kumar as Mirza Sajjad Ali and Saeed Jaffrey as Mir Roshan Ali are perfect in the two roles.The cinematography of Ray is beautiful and refined as is the world that it describes. Many of the scenes are beautiful compositions and when music and dance mix as in many Indian films it fits perfectly in the story and the ambiance of the court. The story of the takeover of the last Muslim kingdom of India by the British with the passive complicity of the local nobility too busy to live its life of luxury and enjoy its preferred pleasures is forever cast in the images of this wonderful film.".

Mark Curtis Like many of director Satyajit Ray's later films The Chess Players takes places in a series of confined locations in which men barter scheme and plot. Along with The Home and the World it's also one of the few Satyajit Ray films to deal overtly with British Imperialism.Fittingly The Chess Players opens alongside a chessboard. Disembodied hands reach out and manoeuvre the board's pieces a motif which will extend throughout Ray's picture in The Chess Players everyone's a puppet on a string.We're then given a brief history lesson Ray using cartoons paintings and narration to touch upon the life and customs of 19th century India and the events which will lead to the annexation of the Indian State of Oudh by the notorious British East India Company. The film then watches as British Imperialists led by General Outram Richard Attenborough scheme to remove Muslim ruler Wajid Ali Shah from Oudh's capital of Lucknow. They want him out and their own puppets in.Unsurprisingly the British view Wajid Ali Shah as a savage hedonistic and salacious. Ray subverts these prejudices Ali Shah is also an artist poet and more importantly is one of the few Indians in power to resist the Company's attempts at expansion. Other monarchs and noblemen  noblemen who should share Ali Shah's class interests  remain oblivious to the Empire's scheming. They sit in their private cocoons disinterested.At its best The Chess Players details how the apathy and disunity of India's ruling classes allowed a comparatively small number of British officials and soldiers to conquer regions without opposition. Like Ray's later film The Home and the World The Chess Players also presents a fairly nuanced view of progress. In Ray's hands feudalism and monarchy are as brutal stupid and reactionary as European Imperialism but each of these conflicting systems are nevertheless beneficial in the sense that they supplant destroy or mitigate the excesses of the other. Ray would himself hint at this in interviews Easy targets don't interest me very much. I was portraying two negative forces feudalism and colonialism and condemning both. The Chess Players was based on a Munshi Premchand short story of the same name. It was Ray's first and only feature to be shot in a language other than his native Bengal. It remains one of the more sophisticated films about the divide and conquer tactics used by the British in India but lacks the visual splendour oft associated with the genre A Passage to India Gandhi North West Frontier Khartoum etc.810  See Pontecorvo's Burn!.".

In terms of language this fim is very unlike of any other Satyajit Ray film as most are Bengali. But in terms of authenticity it has surely Ray's vision and is up there to match up the standards.Set in 1856 Lucknow the story is about the last king of Awadh it questions the ethnicity and the political will of the then British empire. Played by Amjad Khan who brings out a fine performance and in fact all the performances are just in place even the one scene of Farooq Sheikh where he gives a blank expression is also done very well. I loved every actor here but Amjad Khan stood out for me as the fat bumpy king who is oblivious to everything apart from his personal indulgences.Shot exquisitely simply in comparison to any period film the film is very strong in drama and holds you to see if war will happen and it may disappoint you if you expected it to be a movie on freedom struggle. The pathos that the movie evokes does not bring tears to eyes but brings thoughts to minds wasn't British so much better than such kings. Munshi Premchand on whose story the movie was based is in fact one of the most sarcastic writers in Hindi and his sarcasm is hidden he laughs at a society that lives in oblivion and disowns everything but self interest. Coming to the title it's very symbolic if there are two games that will make you forget everything else and will become an addiction the they are the playing card games or chess and this is what symbolises our two main story tellers are addicted so much that even though there is a British army walking to capture Awadh they play chess under the tree.It's simple yet strong and very daunting memory of Satyajit Memory may be with you for a long time to come. It's 35 that is good. Our master Satyajit ray made many better movies".

Add to this mix a wondrous soundtrack with Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye as minstrels of sorts who stroll and sing throughout making the film almost seem like a musical an outstanding supporting cast including Michael Callan who later appeared on TV's One Life to Live and Dwayne Hickman TV's Dobie Gillis and the result is this hilarious thoroughly entertaining film that was nominated for five Academy Awards Marvin was the sole winner. Catherine Ballou Fondais a recently graduatedfromschool schoolteacher returning home to live with her father on his ranch but he is gunned down upon her arrival. She enlists the help of a loyal ranchhand a couple of outlaws and most notably a hasbeen gunman by the name of Kid Sheleen Marvin to help her get revenge. The result is a thoroughly enjoyable film that still stands up today and Lee Marvin stealing the entire film in his amazing dual role performance as both Tim Strong and Kid Sheleen. Lee Marvin alone makes the film well worth seeing.The dialogue is great. Take this exchange as an exampleJackson TwoBears Kid Kid what a time to fall off the wagon. Look at your eyes. Kid Sheleen What's wrong with my eyes? Jackson TwoBears Well they're red bloodshot. Kid Sheleen You ought to see 'em from my side.I was thrilled when the widescreen special edition of this longtime favorite of mine came out in 2003 and on DVD. I have the soundtrack on vinyl but I have always wished that it would come out on CD Nat King Cole is one of my alltime favorite singers and his rendition of They'll Never Make Me Cry always makes me...anyway. This film still hasn't lost any of its humor or fun with the passing of time and stays on of my personal top ten list of comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched Cat Ballou again the other day after a gap of over 35 years. A spoof western definitely. That Lee Marvin should not have won the Oscar? No way. It is far more difficult to carry off a role in what is obviously a pastiche than to excel in a serious dramatic part. Lee Marvin plays it to perfection. Watch his face in the bar scene in the hole in the wall desperately trying to catch the moment to propose a toast  I'll drink to that!. It's brilliant. This film has to be watched in the context of its time. It is no good trying to compare it to today's special effects dominated blockbusters or Pixar animations. The semimusical format was innovative and remains so today. Cat Ballou is a perfect example of 60's cool.".

	schema:reviewBody "This HAS to be one of Jane Fonda's favorite movies she gets to be both shy naive ingenue and rip roaring Western leader of an outlaw gang.  Her outlawing is beautifully justified as the evil town members plot to take over her father's spread and finally have him killed.  All are in on the plottake including the sheriff a ne'er do well planted in the job.  There are many similarities to 'Silverado' an equally well acted ensemble tour de force. Whoever did Lee Marvin's drunken riding mostly out of the saddle close to the ground did a superior riding job. And if it was Lee himself more credit to him.  He got the Oscar and justifiably so.  Under the comedy was the message concerning the sheeplike behavior of 'respectable middleclass people' the wicked townfolk bankrolled by the Wolf Company love these names.  Katherine Ballou the respectable lovely schoolmistress goes bad as the 'nice' people show themselves to be worse than the outlaws. HoleintheWall outlaws are allowed to live there undisturbed because the scion of the Wolfe company who is responsible for having Jane's father shot and whom Jane shoots lets them alone.  They existed safely 'under the radar' but they want to put Jane et al out because her gang's actions make them visible.  Reminds me of many Massachusetts politicians as well as Whitey Bulger.  The 'Indian's' comments are hilarious expecially about Custer spoken as he is surrounded by neatly dressed town thugs. It's an uptodate funny tale with a social morale.  You get the lesson without the moralizing.  I loved it and so glad I bought it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cat Ballou is a fun romp through the great American west. While it presents a definite Apple Dumpling Gang atmosphere it still retains its gritty and resolute ...they'll never make her cry... feeling. One of the best American Western comedies.Fonda is compelling as Catherine Cat Ballou the schoolmarmgonebad. Her performance in this movie is among the best performances of her career.Lee Marvin's acting abilities really reach out and grab you with his dual role as Kid Shelleen and brothergonehorriblywrong Tim Strawn. As Shelleen you get to experience his comedic genius this movie has a classic comedy scene that most of us never forget featuring Marvin as Shelleen sitting on his horse and he AND the horse are leaning drunkenly against a building and as Tim Strawn the tension POPS out at you.Michael Callan plays Clay Boone Cat's wouldbe love interest. Michael Callan also known as Mickey Calin has done tons of movies starting with They Came to Cordure in 1959. In Cat Ballou his honest face and earnest smile captivate you right away and his performance as Boone holds you there. Although he's had loads of roles most Americans will probably remember him from his stint on One Life to Live a popular American soap opera. He played Jack Simmons.Frankie Ballou Cat's Father is played extremely well by John Marley a curmudgeonly rancher who has definite views however odd they may be on the true origins of the Native American.This movie has it all! Action suspense comedy and heart. It also boasts some of the greatest stars of its time Jane Fonda Lee Marvin Dwayne Hickman Stubby Kaye !! Marvin Acme in Who Framed Roger Rabbit Ellis Island 1984 Taxi 1953 Guys and Dolls 1955 and Lil Abner 1959 among many more Reginald Denny and Bruce Cabot!The story is narrated in song by Nat King Cole playing professor Sam The Shade AS Nat King Cole. This movie whisks you from your seat carries you down the river and plunges you over the waterfall. Hang on and enjoy the ride.It easily rates an 8.410 from...the Fiend .".

John Marley is pretty funny also and Cat's father his views on the Indian nation are revolutionary to say the least.  Tom Nardini is wonderful as the hired hand who goes along on Cat's quest none too willingly.All in all this is a tourdeforce of acting and writing.

We all thought it was funny we knew it was a comedy however the audience was not roaring with riotous laughter. That is sometimes a good sign that you are watching a satire.  There was plenty of silliness and slapstick as well and some real wild west weirdness the sterling silver nose that Kid Strawn wears etc.  Funny how the opening song stayed with me from 1965 on although I don't believe I have ever seen the film from the beginning since that first time.It's a hangin' day in Wolf City Wyomin' Wolf City Wyomin' She killed a man it's truue And that's a why their hangin' Hangin' Cat BallouThis oddball flick seemed to really say something about our view of the western film and I think that is the one of the points that helped it win some awards.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cat Ballou's significance in film history is not the quality of the film itself though it's a pretty funny piece of work. It's because it vaulted Lee Marvin up from the ranks of featured players and made him a star with an hysterical Oscar winning performance.It's also the only time in film history that anyone won an Oscar for a dual role. Marvin is featured as deadly contract killer Jack Strawn and as his alcoholic brother Kid Shelleen.The brothers get into a range feud and opposite sides. An eastern conglomerate headed by Reginald Denny is putting the squeeze on John Marley right at the same time as his daughter Jane Fonda in the title role is coming back from eastern finishing school. Marley and Fonda have a hired killer strong arming them so at the suggestion of a curious gang of friends she's developed Michael Callan Dwayne Hickman and Tom Nardini she goes and gets her own outlaw. Of course the dueling Marvins do have it out and I think you can guess who won.Sometimes it's easy to forget about some of the others in Cat Ballou because of Marvin's Oscar. Jane Fonda looks like she's having a great old time satirizing certain themes that are sacred in Hollywood westerns. She plays her role as the budding Calamity Jane absolutely straight and lets the comedy fall around her.One favorite I have from the film is Hollywood veteran Reginald Denny. In the old days he was usually a rival or best friend to various leading men in the Hollywood English colony. He looks like he's having one grand old time playing the rakish Harry Percival the chief villain of Cat Ballou.The film is helped along with those singing narrations by Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye. At one time Cole and Kaye are in a bordello and he's both singing and playing the honky tonk piano. Since Cole's velvet syrupy singing is what most remember him for it's good to remember that in the beginning Cole was a jazz pianist and his original records were with the Nat King Cole Trio as a pianist. His singing was something added and then took over his career. Cole was one of the great and most unique voices of the last century he left us way too soon.Four years later John Wayne won his Oscar for the boozy Rooster Cogburn in True Grit. What I would have loved to have seen is Wayne and Marvin playing their Oscar winning characters in a dual venture. That would have been a movie to remember.As is the funny and touching Cat Ballou.".

This was a one of a kind comedy performance by Lee Marvin who won an Oscar for his role as Shelleen... and of course he steals every scene he is in... even when he doesn't have any dialogue. And then there is the funeral scene... undoubtedly the funniest funeral scene ever if you can imagine such a thing. Great soundtrack by Stubby Kaye and Nat King Cole who portray wandering folk singers who wind up singing The Ballad of Cat Ballou throughout the movie. What's wrong with my eyes? They're bloodshot.

This was a one of a kind comedy performance by Lee Marvin who won an Oscar for his role as Shelleen... and of course he steals every scene he is in... even when he doesn't have any dialogue. And then there is the funeral scene... undoubtedly the funniest funeral scene ever if you can imagine such a thing. Great soundtrack by Stubby Kaye and Nat King Cole who portray wandering folk singers who wind up singing The Ballad of Cat Ballou throughout the movie. What's wrong with my eyes? They're bloodshot. You oughta see 'em from MY side.";

Th settings and locales in the film are standard western ones and very fine the film is wellmade without ever appearing to be slick. So is the music by Frank de Vol and unusual songs scattered throughout. The piece's able director Elliot Silverstein has coaxed some of their best work ever from Jane Fonda as Cat Michael Callan as her outlaw fiance Dwayne Hickman as a bogus preacher John Marley as her father Reginald Denny J.C.

There is an unusual narration sung expertly and winningly Subby Kaye and Nat King Cole. The costumes by Bill Thomas are wonderful and there is a roughandready style about the work that millions have found engaging. The dialogue from a novel is wellabove average also. This is a film that bears more than one viewing it is clever intentionally funny and quire wellconstructed. Recommended to anyone who resents bullies or simply enjoys a wellearned laugh twelve.

Intriguing while it focuses on the obsessive sexual relationship between noncommittal Claire Kerry Fox and embittered divorced Jay Mark Rylance the film tends to lose its way as more characters and situations are introduced. Shot with a lot of handheld camera in Jay's untidy flat in crowded bars and in busy South London streets about the only visually beautiful frames are those showing Claire's and Jay's intertwined naked bodies relaxing after their frenzied lovemaking. Meeting once a week and hardly speaking to each other both Claire and Jay seem to be satisfied with little more than sex but his curiosity takes over he begins to follow her and is resentful and envious when faced with the realisation that she has a life of her own and may simply be using him. The movie explores questions such as  how far can sex alone can take a relationship and do words add to or detract from love? Another theme is that of role playing on the stage and in life.         Both Fox and Rylance are superb in their scenes together and Timothy Spall is excellent as Claire's talkative downtoearth husband. But I confess to finding Claire's friend Betty Marianne Faithfull a baffling character. Some sequences particularly those involving Jay's friend Victor Alastair Galbraith and gay French barman Ian Philippe Calvario seem simply to be padding. Possibly Chereau felt the need to insert personalities and scenes from Kureishi's books even though these were not relevant to the central ClaireJay situation. Finally yes the overhyped explicit sex is necessary for the movie to work.".

You almost have to stop watching to consider all of the implications of what has happened.Sure there are some strange inexplicable events but that's life isn't it? So based on boldness superb acting amazing realization or direction this film will shock and satisfy puzzle and pique your interest. One of the greats to emerge from the new realist school of European film making. Along with Romance and Blais Moi.

Still I have no idea how a sexually repressed country like Britain will pass this film without cuts.  It will be intriguing to see the infantile controversy that this film will ignite in the media when it plays here.I wouldn't recommend this film for those who are used to fastpaced stories and quickfire dialogue.  I never found the pacing too slow but you have to watch everything carefully to feel the full impact of the movie.If you have ever had a passionate but ultimately painful affair this film will throw up all those feelings that you thought you had forgotten.".

This can make for difficult viewing requiring an inordinate amount of concentration to keep up and which wears you down after a while and it only sinks in long after it's over. But that's the film's strong point the writers prefer to have you draw your own conclusions with dialogue that forces you to read between the lines of an affair in which both participants seem to be using it to address their individual demons. Chereau and Kureishi are more interested in their characters' circumstances than their actions but it's precisely their circumstances that make their actions compelling. Mark Rylance and Kerry Fox are the lovers and they're excellent even though the fact their trysts are presented in explicit detail may overshadow their performances with Rylance as a bitter bartender who has spontaneously abandoned his family and Fox as a drama teacher stifled in her marriage to a cabbie Mike Leigh favorite Timothy Spall also very fine whom Rylance befriends in an attempt to understand her it's the tensions that build around the trio that drives the narrative.

	schema:headline " Raw movie about mid life disenchantment";
	schema:reviewBody "Intimacy is a European coproduction directed by French director Patrice Chereau in his first English speaking feature also set in the UK. The script is based on two pieces by writer Hanif Kureishi the book Intimacy and the short story Nightime.Intimacy tells the story of Andy a divorce bartender who meets Claire at his apartment on Wednesday to have sex no words involved... until they start to click emotionally and Andy starts following her to know more about her.Intimacy is a soaring and raw movie about mid life disenchantment and the need of physical contact to built emotional one.The film has been controversial due to the presence of explicit sexual scenes. However reducing such a good film and story to just the sex scenes is intentionally misleading moralistic and completely unfair to a story that presents many of the problems of middleagers in a honest and raw way abandonment divorce loneliness the feeling of being lost and emotional empty the sense of not going anywhere in life the trouble to fulfill your responsibilities as an adult despite being all messed up in your head and soul fracas and rejection unhappiness and hope. All of this is beautifully blended and portrayed in the film.The sex scenes are very strong very demanding both physically and emotionally simulated most of them but very convincing as they really and feel very real. The viewer gets the impression that is watching a real couple having sex. The sex is always raw and goes from almost brutal to sweet from hungry to delightful from anxious to comforting with all the body language and emotions associated to different emotional states. Being so the viewer does not feel aroused by the images but sad and anxious about the couple being so needy of contact and so unable to contact. The sex in that sense is a proof of the soul and feelings of the characters not a dirty thing. In that regards the film creates a clear line between what sex is not and sets a clear boundary with porn despite the fellatio in the film being non simulated which is portrayed as a sweet moment of sharing and not a as woman mechanically sucking a man off for his own pleasure and as a sexual slave.The mood of the movie is great with a mix of night and interior greenishyellowish depressing scenes and warm and luminous ones. The art direction is great as well as the music.The performances by all actors are terrific convincing powerful and masterful especially the leading couple Mark Rylance as Jay and Kerry Fox as Claire in two roles that are extremely demanding both at a physical and emotional level. The supporting actors are also good and convincing Alastair Galbraith as Claire's husband Victor Philippe Calvario as the gay bartender Ian Timothy Spall as Jay's drug addict brother Andy and Marianne Faithful as Claire's friend Betty among others. Although Galbraith is always terrific I don't think he was the right person physically for his character as it is difficult to believe that Claire would be with this sort of guy to be honest.A very sad movie not easy to watch with confronting images and themes moving at times with a very powerful story wonderfully performed and directed. Abstain from viewing if you are a puritan as you will only see the sex.".

It didn't for me and I think the reason is simple. I'm not British. There are three main characters here involved in a triangle the tentativeness and purpose of which forms the spine of the story. But they are surrounded by others. Men with men and women with women. These characters I think are meant to define a sort of broken world a sort of disordering set of forces in which our three are situated. So they are quirky exaggerated and because I'm seeing traits that I only see in other British films they seem to be templates and therefore unreal. They seem to be from a store that same store where you get eccentric secondary characters for romantic comedies or that Bristish twist the self absorbed Trainspotting genre.This ruins the whole effect for me because they may be real people but they live in an unreal world so the story doesn't matter.But there is one thing about this that is remarkable. Its the construction of the narrative.Remember that the whole thing depends on us getting the message that these actors are committed to being real? Our focus character is a woman who is an actress trying to be real. More as she in the movie is intent on showing us how to be real she plays a character who is not only an actress with similar aspirations. But she has a job showing other less talented actors how to do the same. Its a really cool narrative fold. The problem with folds is that they are usually outside the narrative a sort of metanarrative that declares the movie is fake. But you cannot really get much away without folding these days. So this writer has folded directly and openly within the story in a way devised to move the metanarrative away from outside the film to coming from within. Its a character folding not an actor.Even though this did not work for me it might for you. And this very clever engineering of narrative makes it worth watching.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "With it's premise of anonymous sex and emotionally distant characters this in some ways resembles a cross between Last Tango in Paris and the recent Closer but the manner in which the material is handled fails to come even remotely close to those superior films. Story is about Jay Mark Rylance who's a divorced father of two boys and now is head bartender in a popular English pub. Every Wednesday afternoon he meets Claire Kerry Fox and the two of them have sex but do not discuss with each other who the other person is.SPOILER ALERT Claire stops coming by on Wednesdays and Jay starts to follow her around and discovers that she's an amateur actress working in a play in the back of a pub. Jay enters the establishment and views the play and actually meets Claire's husband Andy Timothy Spall and starts a friendship with him but after a few visits it becomes apparent to Andy what is going on between them.Patrice Chereau is an actordirectorwriter and has worked a good deal in the theater and there are several scenes that take place with the actors that appear could have fit well in a stage production. The story takes an angry approach to it's characters as their portrayed as people who just cannot commit completely emotionally and while as interesting as that is it's hard to feel one way or another for those involved. In Closer we don't feel remorse but we do understand and feel their pain and anger but here the story tries so hard for the viewer to know how distant these people are that it ultimately becomes impossible to have one feeling or another. Spliced into this film are some pretty good performances and while Rylance shows he can carry a picture it's the always reliable Fox that is easier to identify with. Arguably the best performance comes from Spall Secrets and Lies who shows us a character that has good instincts but after all the years of marriage finds out that his wife is terribly unhappy. Chereau presents us with characters that had real potential but the script fails in terms of allowing the viewer to be interested in their struggles.".

Already winner of notable awards at the Berlin Film Festival including Best Actress it could be set to offer Kerry Fox an Oscar nomination. In the French Cinema Verite tradition the story looks at the ultimate bleakness of a purely sexual relationship where the two participants meet only for sex and know hardly anything about each other. From an initial kitchen sink drama level it opens out into a more colourful world where we see the two main characters in the context of their individual worlds. The characters feelings have by this time developed for each other but without any knowledge or understanding of their respective lives. A scene involving an acting class seems to comment not only on how we can compartmentalise our lives in this way but raises questions about acting in art and in real life and also on the boundaries of intimacy and censorship. Intimacy pushes the censors boundaries in this film as have a number of recent French films  the graphic inclusion of genitalia and oral sex being the issues here for British cinema which have been passed uncut. The movie is neither titillating or gratuitous so cuts it could be argued would have been morally abhorrent. The transformations Kerry Fox undergoes are emotionally powerful  I still felt shaken by the time I got home from the cinema.".

In the process we see how he does it and along the way are treated to some amusing cameos by Mel Gibson Chris Rock and Matthew McConaughey. Yeah it's kind of a lowbrow revenge flick but it works.

Laramie decides that the only to stop his problems is to take them out one by one.A team of four relentless paparazzi soon are the ones who become the victims. The ringleader of the gang Rex Harper Tom Sizemore soon realizes that he and his gang are the ones in danger. Wendell Stokes Daniel Baldwin Leonard Clark Tom Hollander and Kevin Rosner Kevin Gage make up the four paparazzi that Laramie is bend on destroying.One of the highlights of my summer was Paparazzi. I wanted to see this since I first saw the trailer for it. Looked like a pretty interesting take on the actionthriller genres. The lead roles Cole Hauser and Tom Sizemore are quite impressive. In my opinion Sizemore owns this movie. While it's not the role he was born to play I can't see many others playing the role of Harper.One thing I found interesting is that Mel Gibson along with other producers of Paparazzi were inspired to make this film upon reading articles of paparazzi attacks. Not as serious as the one in the film but nevertheless.The film is one of the first of its kind. That I've seen anyways. Exploiting the paparazzi. It just sounds like a fun movie to me. One that I haven't seen before. Paparazzi is other all a very fun enjoyable and a very entertaining flick. Check it out. You won't be disappointed. I wasn't.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw it last night. I think this movie is misunderstood. I want to believe that the reasons behind this movie's dismal reviews in the main have to do with the fact that certain people with certain political leanings WANT to hate it and hate Gibson for the sheer and utter sole reason that he made THE PASSION OF THE Christ that it has a socalled and totally offthewall  and wrong! message of antiSemitism... and that he made the movie anyway despite protests from the political Left of Hollywood. Have you noticed that Mel Gibson actually placed his name in the credits of this movie as its producer? I can't think of any other Icon Productions film in which his name is placed at all. Granted Mel doesn't need the money. As far as money goes he's set for the rest of his life and the rest of his kids' lives. But he has a passion no pun intended for making movies and he's proving that you can't keep him out of Hollywood by placing his name in the forefront of the credits of this particular Icon Productions project.It's a fun movie. First and foremost. That's the point of having so many uncredited cameos most prominently Mel Gibson as an Anger Management patient sitting in the doctor's office scribbling away in the 5 workbooks piled up in his lap.Secondly this is a western set in modern society. Whatever you might think of westerns as a genre PAPARAZZI is for the most part Gregory Peck's THE BRAVADOS with a Hollywood filmmaking setting. Westerns have long been a staple of the family for Hollywood filmmakers since its beginnings. Also Gibson has himself stated that in prepping BRAVEHEART for filming he watched  among other movies  Gregory Peck's THE BIG COUNTRY. I think Gibson is a fan of Peck's as well as a huge movie buff in his own right and PAPARAZZI is a tip of the hat to westerns in general. Also add to the fact that the main character of PAPARAZZI hails from Montana.Lastly believe it or not I think this movie is oriented to the family. Not only does this movie have Mel Gibson in a cameo but also Vince Vaughan and Matthew McConaughey. It also features Chris Rock who appeared with Gibson in LETHAL WEAPON 4 as well as Fay Masterson who was in Gibson's directorial debut THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE.This movie isn't on the scale of BENHUR or THE BIG COUNTRY. This movie is what it is... fun. I applaud Mel Gibson and crew for delivering the goods.".

But he has a passion no pun intended for making movies and he's proving that you can't keep him out of Hollywood by placing his name in the forefront of the credits of this particular Icon Productions project.It's a fun movie. First and foremost. That's the point of having so many uncredited cameos most prominently Mel Gibson as an Anger Management patient sitting in the doctor's office scribbling away in the 5 workbooks piled up in his lap.Secondly this is a western set in modern society. Whatever you might think of westerns as a genre PAPARAZZI is for the most part Gregory Peck's THE BRAVADOS with a Hollywood filmmaking setting. Westerns have long been a staple of the family for Hollywood filmmakers since its beginnings. Also Gibson has himself stated that in prepping BRAVEHEART for filming he watched  among other movies  Gregory Peck's THE BIG COUNTRY. I think Gibson is a fan of Peck's as well as a huge movie buff in his own right and PAPARAZZI is a tip of the hat to westerns in general. Also add to the fact that the main character of PAPARAZZI hails from Montana.Lastly believe it or not I think this movie is oriented to the family. Not only does this movie have Mel Gibson in a cameo but also Vince Vaughan and Matthew McConaughey. It also features Chris Rock who appeared with Gibson in LETHAL WEAPON 4 as well as Fay Masterson who was in Gibson's directorial debut THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE.This movie isn't on the scale of BENHUR or THE BIG COUNTRY. This movie is what it is... fun. I applaud Mel Gibson and crew for delivering the goods.";

I don't believe in actors getting paid 20 million for a single film and living in multiple mansions when harder working folks get nothing. But then you have to consider what the character of Bo Laramie says in this film. Perhaps every time someone takes your picture you lose a bit of your soul. Maybe the constant hassling of the press is only worth 20 million. Celebrities do rub it in our faces a bit too much about how much money they have. We are the ones that see their movies and buy their CDs. It's because of us that they have what they have right? And when we want a little bit of them back when we want a little insight into their lives that ultimately we have helped create for them they often bite back with attitude.There is a line that is not to be crossed though. The odd picture here and there is more than enough. But as there are so many many tabloid magazines out there all with the same kind of singleword singlesyllable title the business has become very diluted and all of them are willing to buy the most mundane photos of celebs doing uninteresting things. Not only this but they take it to rather perverted extremes and it baffles me that anyone could be at all interested in it. I've seen longshots of celebs hanging around like any person ought to but with massive closeups of sweaty armpits circled for the benefit of anyone not enlightened to the point of the picture. Morbid closeups of some celebrity's blouse revealing some milkshake she spilled a few hours earlier is just plain creepy. Sadly there are thousands of parasites out there who are willing to fork over their hardearned cash for such rags. I'll never understand the fascination.Celebs are made out to be Gods of some kind. Something we all want to be but never can. Their teeth are perfect their wiveshusbands beautiful their children beautiful their homes are palaces and their lifestyles enviable. Most of us live our whole lives in jealousy of celebs. This is why we just want a little bit more back from them. They can afford it right? With all that money and 'power' a few pics here and there won't hurt will they? Well I can't imagine myself liking it very much. And considering the crap I've seen some celebs take I personally don't think any of it's worth 20 million. Punching a Paparazzo in the face with my fist going through his camera first sounds like the best image of all in my opinion. Since a union of celebs is actually quite powerful I do believe their wills be much much tighter laws in the near future to curb Paparazzi. There's always some story of some actor taking a weaselly photographer to court.Or you could do it the way Bo Laramie does.Laramie Cole Hauser is a former Montana carpenter who has by pure chance become a star in Hollywood through various xXxstyle action movies. The public loves him and wants more than he is willing to offer. His private life is constantly being invaded by those peeking in. But they are taking pictures too. Rex Harper the very cool but sadly selfdestructive Tom Sizemore is one of those pesky photographers. And Laramie doesn't take too kindly to Harper taking pics of his son playing football. He responds by punching out Harper only a group of his Paparazzi pals including Dannythe best Baldwin the psycho killer from Heat and some highly annoying English guy you can't wait to see hanging from a tree catch the whole thing on film and whore out their footage to the highest bidder.Now with a personal vendetta between them a childish game is promptly brought to an end or only just beginning when they involve Laramie and his family in a Princess Dianastyle car wreck. And instead of calling an ambulance they take pictures of their bloody bodies. Sadly it's not sounding farfetched yet.Having not learned from other's mistake Laramie is still hassled by the photographers and press and they continue to fabricate stories and bend read utterly distort the truth to line their own pockets. Little do they know Laramie is planning a Punisherstyle revenge on the 4 dolts responsible for his tragedy.Click on my reviews to find a coninuation of this criticism in another film of the same name as the IMDb only allows 1000 words.".

Those movies are works of art Paparazzi is not. That said let's move on to the revue. This movie wasn't made with the Oscar's in mind. If you're watching this movie I hope you're watching it munching on a bowl of popcorn with a bunch of friends tossing the kernels at the screen every time you see a crime being committed with the perp not giving a damn about fingerprints. Their are a lot of things overlooked in this movie like DNA prints alibis but this isn't CSI. So if you're worried about the plotholes don't be just watch the movie for the hilarious cameos and the nonstop action. If you're a turn the other cheek kind of person the movie may not be for you but if you're a smite my enemies scream bloody vengeance kind of guy this movie will leave you smiling.

The payoff is totally overblown. I stopped rooting for Cole Hauser when he started to set up the deaths of the Paparazzis. O.K. the car crash scene a comment on Princess Diana's untimely death and some of their methods and background explained by the investigating LAPD detective shows them as real scumbags but the very straight revenge plot without even a hint of a plot twist makes Hauser's actions unjustified. I also didn't like the last reaction of the detective I know you killed the thugs but I won't tell anyone because I support you. I would have loved a plot where the guys get killed accidentally in a way not intended by Hauser or where the detective steps in and pays for it with his life  just to keep ethics in place. I need people to do much worse things than threatening to visit your son in the hospital which was even later revealed as a panic reaction to justify beating them to death with a baseball bat and carefully set up a plot to frame the worst of the baddies for the death. A real hack job by the screenwriters to make a movie with a small setup and a huge payoff. Worth only to see Cole Hauser Tom Sizemore can't be wrong casting him and Dennis Farina.".

Granted like all Bmovies it's a bit hokey at times and also follows along the trademark lines with films of this caliber obligatory boob shot corny dialogue poor camera techniques etc..But give Night of the Creeps its due. First of all it is fairly original for a Bmovie. Alien slugs that infest the brain and turn you into a zombie may seem like a typical Bmovie theme but it's portrayed in a fairly unique manner. Given the time period of this movie's release and it's obviously small budget I'm quite impressed with the specialeffects of the alien slugs as they race along the ground throughout the film. They're so simple that it makes them look realistic and somewhat unnerving. In horror films it is often the most simple effects that are the most discomforting to the viewer. I put these alien slugs along that line. I really like Tom Atkins Lethal Weapon as Detective Cameron too. He's the perfect actor for this particular role as the washedup detective. Unfortunately or perhaps fortunately for Tom's career it seems that he often got typecast to play the depressed onedge characters. Atkins is one of the bonuses in this Bflick. Another acting bonus would have to be our two young heroes played by Jason Lively European Vacation and Jill Whitlow. Lively as always plays the young likable clod. Somewhat bashful somewhat moronic somewhat accidentprone but you can't help but like the guy. And Whitlow is just plain cute. I sometimes think that 80's flicks didn't have enough cute girls in them but Whitlow is definitely one of them. All in all Night of the Creeps is good for a Bmovie. It'll entertain you for sure and you won't get sick of it while you're watching. It's definitely one to watch if you're into the Bmovie thing.".

Flash forward to the mid 1980s and the youth is now cryogenically frozen in a university lab for study. At least until Chris Romero Jason Lively and J.C. Hooper Steve Marshall release him and he begins infecting countless members of a small college town.Director and writer Fred Dekker who has had a lamentably short career as a helmer wrote Night of the Creeps in seven days. He told himself that if he did not get to the end of the script by that selfimposed deadline the whole thing would go into the garbage. If this is what one can come up with in such a flurry maybe more scripts should have time limits. We should also be glad that he sold the script with a caveat if he wasn't allowed to helm the film he wasn't going to sell it. He's said that he didn't care if it sold or not at the time.Why Dekker has received so little recognition and respect in the industry is difficult to say. Night of the Creeps didn't have the wide release and promotion that it deserved especially given its 5 million budget it's curious that TriStar didn't push more to make its money back. Both this film and Dekker's 1987 effort The Monster Squad are currently only available on bootleg DVDs in the U.S.Night of the Creeps is one of the better horrorcomedies of the 1980s. The script is clever paying homage to everything from 1950s scifi horror to the zombie craze started by George Romero to 1980s slasher films and even John Hughes. Just in case one couldn't catch the homage angle Dekker has a lot of character and place names that are tributes to various genre directors. Dekker's dialogue is witty and memorablethere are a few classic diatribes in the film that would be worthwhile and a lot of fun to memorize. Dekker's writing is selfconscious and selfmocking predating Scream 1996 by 10 years there is actually a whole class of 1980s and early 1990s flicks that were doing everything Scream was credited with revolutionizing. Dekker is not afraid to be joyously silly as with genre character actor favorite Tom Atkins' response when asked if he's Detective CameronNo Bozo the Clown. Dekker even gives us the 1980s high school classic of the handcranked middle finger.But Night of the Creeps isn't just a comedy. The serious horror aspects of Night of the Creeps are extremely well done. The film is suspenseful the effects are good and there is plenty of gore for fans. Dekker could have easily made an effective retro horror filmmost of the first five minutes are set in the 1950s shot in black and white and have an authentic feel with just a dash of tongue in its cheek. He smoothly transitions from The Blob 1958 and Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1956styled scifi with heavy Alien 1979 touches to early 1980s slasher material then to a more complex and fantastic collage of zombies slugs and detectives seeking revenge.While the film isn't likely to be appreciated by those who dislike mixing their horror with comedy and especially won't be appreciated by viewers who don't even realize that it's supposed to also be a comedy neither type is very likely to watch it in the first placeat least not for long. For those with the appropriate mindset and love of horror it's a lot more fun if one is familiar with everything being referenced Night of the Creeps is a gem that deserves better recognition. We should at least be able to buy it on an official DVD and please put both endings on the disc.".

My guess would be that it played in very brief limited release or was a product of a straighttovideo release. In either case a tragedy. I discovered this film late one night while watching Cinemax. I saw that it was from 1986 and starred Jason Lively who I vaguely remembered from National Lampoon's European Vacation. I never gave much of a second thought to his performance in that film but he was surprisingly decent here. Since I am an avid Horror film fan and this was a product of the 80's that I was not at all familiar with it picqued my curiosity. So I decided to give this one a try and am so glad that I chose to do so. What a refreshing little gem this was to discover. I can't believe I had never heard anything about it before one way or another. A great little Bmovie that does not take itself too seriously. This film has it all terrific writing impressive acting especially Tom Atkins zombies creepy slugs an axmurderer aliens fraternity studs sorority babes as well as lovable lonely dorks. This would make an excellent double feature along with ReAnimator. I only hope that this film will one day get to see the light of day and be given a royal DVD release hint hint Anchor Bay. Do not miss an opportunity to see this one if you can.".

	schema:reviewBody "Night Of The Creeps is a brilliant and very entertaining Horror film that SciFiHorrorComedy that combines great directiona wonderful casta wellwritten screenplaygreat special effects and a memorable soundtrack. All of those combinations make Night Of The Creeps one of the best Horror films of the 1980s and a Cult Classic.Night Of The Creeps tells the story of two college students ChrisJason Livelyand J.CSteve Marshallwho are asked to pull a prank by a college fraternity by taking out a cadaverthat's been frozen since 1959and put it on the ground of a rival fraternity. Unfortunatelythe Cadaver is still alive because it contains Alien Zombie slugs from outer space that are let loose on the college campus and posses people one by one. Now Chris and J.C with the help of Chris' Dream girl CynthiaJill Whitlowand Police Detective Ray CameronTom Atkinsthe four have to the stop the possessed zombies and save the campus.Night Of The Creeps is easily one of the bestmost memorable and entertaining Horror films of the 1980s that unfortunately wasn't a big hit when it came out in 1986 because Night Of The Creeps didn't get a nationwide theatrical release but instead got a limited release grossing 591366 not even making back it's 5 million dollar budget. But thankfully Night Of The Creeps has become a Cult Classic and for a good reason it's a great genre film. One of the reasons Night Of The Creeps is such a great Horror film is because writerdirector Fred Dekker has taken his love for Horror and SCIFI BMovies and has put in this film making a movie that is scaryfunny and at times campy and not straying away from it's purpose of making a Horror film that is clever and slick. The Comedy and Humor in this film is hilarious because NOTC makes fun of the Bmovie trademarks of the Horror and SCIFI films of the 1950s and 60s whether it's the Alien Zombiesthe style of the characters or the funny dialog that is quotable and memorable. The Comedy in this film Predates the Post Modern Humor of Scream because like Scream would do ten years later in 1996 Creeps would do as well making fun of classic Horror films while at the same time paying homage and making reference to them. What also makes NOTC post modern is how the college and main characters are named after notable genre directors such as John CarpenterWes CravenGeorge A RomeroRoger Cormanthe university is named Corman UniversityDavid CronenbergTobe HooperJames CameronSam RaimiJohn Landisand Steve Miner. NOTC was so ahead of it's time in terms of it's style. While NOTC is very funny the film still remembers it's a Horror film and NOTC has a few scary and suspenseful moments done are done with great build up and surprises and shocks that will have most viewers jumping from their seats. The four main characters in the NOTC ChrisJ.CCynthia and Detective Ray Cameron are great because while the characters archetypesnerdsgirl next doortough police detectiveall four of them have great depth and likability and you don't want anything bad to happen to them. Where most Horror films have some characters that are just waiting to get killed off and wiped off the face of the earthChrisJ.CCynthia and Ray Cameron are so great to watch you as a viewer want them to survive and save the day. The screenplay by Fred Dekker is truly wonderful fantasticfunnywellwritten and quotable with Dekker giving the main and supporting characters dialog that is witty and smart with a lot greatfunny moments and amazing lines. The violenceblood and gore in the film is welldone an disgusting at times but not disgusting enough to be dark and bleak because the film never takes itself too seriously. Now if there is something that will confuse viewers when they watch the film is the ending because there is two different endings. There is the theatrical release ending which is the jump scare ending and director Fred Dekker's preferred ending which is ambiguousfunny leaves an open ended conclusion. PersonallyI like both endings to the film because I love jump scares at the end of Horror films but at the same time I love endings that are ambiguousopen ended and leave you with questions. Both endings are different but don't stop Night Of The Creeps from being a classic that it is.The whole cast is amazing. Jason Lively is excellent as Chris Romerothe hero of the filmwith Lively bringing depth and likability to the role. Steve Marshall is great and funny as J.CJames Carpenter HooperChris' best friendwith Marshall saying funny lines. Jill Whitlow is fantastic and beautiful as Cynthia CronenbergChris's love interest. Tom Atkins is brilliant and unforgettable as Detective Ray Cameronwith Atkins bringing toughnesshumor and saying memorable oneliners. Allan J. Kayser is wonderful as BradCynthia's jerk boyfriend. Also lookout for cameos from Roger Corman and genre veteran Dick MillerWaltand David PaymerYoung Scientist.The direction by Fred Dekker is excellentwith Dekker always moving the camera with great low and high angleszooms and close ups and bringing a great styletone and pace to the film. Wonderful direction by Dekker.The score by Barry De Vorozen is fantasticcreepy and intense and matches the tone of the film. Great scoreDe Vorozen. There is also great songs from The PlattersSmoke Gets In Your EyesThe DiamondsThe StrollSandy NelsonTeen BeatPaul AnkaPut your Head On My ShoulderPreston EppsBongo RockStan RidgewayThe Big HeatDriveShe Said and much more. Great soundtrack.The special makeup effects by David B. Miller are outstandingbloody and very realistic and add to the film. Fantastic effects by Miller.In final wordif you love Horror Films SCIFI filmsCult Films or genre films in generalI highly suggest you see Night Of The Creepsa scary and funny Horror film and a wonderful Cult Classic that deserves to be in every Horror and genre fans collection. Highly Recommended. 1010.".

Instead they try to find a shooting star and the girl gets hacked up by the killer while her boyfriend gets infected by the alien experiment in the woods that's really the shooting star.

Chris also meets Cynthia Cronenberg Whitlow while detective Cameron Atkins investigates the bodies. He thinks they might have something to do with the killer who murdered his exgirlfriend and shot years ago. J.C. doesn't make it but Chris learns that the slugs infect their hosts turning them into zombies. Soon Chris Ray and Cynthia fight against them and the zombies. I finally watched this a few years ago and liked it since. Atkins is great as usual and steals the film.

	schema:reviewBody "Fred Dekker directs this somewhat forgotten lowbudget horror spoof from the 80's. Dekker treats the material liberally and never tries to make the movie anything more than a fun B movie going for laughs. Although not always an easy thing to do Dekker and his virtual cast of unknowns pulls it off rather nicely. The story begins with a wonderfully filmed flashback in the 1950's where we see something fall from the sky passing overhead the boys and girls parked at a Lookout type place. Unfortunately whilst this goes on an ax murderer has escaped the asylum in that very vicinity. Now you might think what do these two things possibly have to do with each other but Dekker the screenwriter pulls that off as well as the film jumps to the present 1980's and we meet two lovableOK maybe not so lovable losers one with a pair of crutches and cracking wise constantly and the other newly lovesick with a young lady he has just seen from across the street. To spin a long tale short  these two want to join a fraternity to impress the girl are asked to throw a cadaver on another fraternity's lawn find a cryogenetically frozen bodyfrom the 50's that had met with what fell from the sky and all havoc breaks out as parasites in the brain begin to throw themselves from the cadaver's mouth to the mouths of others. Aside from mentioning Night of the Living Dead by name Dekker's use of his walking dead pays on obvious homage to horrormeister George Romero. The film creates some interesting characters while again never taking anything serious. Tom Atkins the Carpenter guy plays a police detective that lost his girl back in the 50's to the ax murderer and while I initially felt like he was over doing things early on with his overblown performance I found it working shortly after and realized the B movie 50's style effect he was going for. He carries it off wonderfully and for me was easily the brightest spot in the film. While Night of the Creeps does have humour throughout there are some genuine scares lots of gore and sustained pacing and suspense. For a little budget movie like this it appears a lot of TLC was put into it  and it shows. As for the rest of the cast Jason Lively plays romeo and Steve Marshall the sidekick. Both are pretty decent and female lead Jill Whitlow while not a particularly good or bad actress is a banquet for the eyes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Night of the Creeps 121409This movie is a gem of the 1980's horrorcomedy genre. It was just released on DVD for the first time this October. Directed by Fred Dekker this landmark movie has inspired many other horror films like 2006's Slither by Sean Gunn. It's a great party film or so I've heard. I don't get out much or I could confirm this theory. The opening scene shows midgets in rubber suits Aliens on a space ship that is being invaded. Is that a great way to open a movie or what! They jettison a container of something into to space and it finds its way to Earth. We then come upon a scene set in the 1950's that is shot in black and white. There is a teenage couple making out at a lovers lane cliff overlooking the city when they sees a UFO crash into a field. They go to examine the crash as the radio blares about an escape mental patient. They pull over on a vacant stretch of road and the guy goes into the woods to investigate. We see the escape psychopath approaching the car and he eventually hacks up the girl with an ax. Upon inspection of the UFO the guy has and alien slug fly into his mouth infecting him. This is where the movie goes back to color and we see Detective Landis disturbed from his nap by the phone ringing. Landis is your typical hardboiled cop who found those bodies' years back. He has the memorable catch phrase of thrill me! every time he answers the phone. Our main characters are two college freshmen. Chris is played by Jason Lively who got the part right after playing Rusty in the classic European Vacation. He is your basic everyman that you can really get behind and root for in a horror movie. Then we have his best friend J.C. played by Steve Marshall. He's a witty smart assed handicapped kid who everybody likes. Except of course those mean frat guys. The head frat guy is played for a laugh since he is such a clichd stereotype. He is a blonde haired sweater vest wearing guy named Brad. His red sports car even has license plates that say Bradster. What a douche! Anyway Chris has a huge crush on a sorority girl Cynthia but she is also the Bradster girlfriend. Chris and J.C. try to get into a fraternity and must somehow get a dead body and put it another frat houses yard as a pledge. In the college medical research building they find a cryochamber with the frozen body of the infected guy from the '50's. Needless to say he is thawed and escapes to infect the campus. Upon investigating the lab Detective Landis asks the cops Is this a homicide or a bad Bmovie. Director Fred Dekker also wrote the script and has several tonguein cheek scenes and bits of dialogue. Kind of like what the Scream movies did in the mid 90's. The alien slugs go in through your mouth and lay eggs in the unfortunate person's brain turning them into zombies. Their heads eventually wheather shot or hit with an ax explode releasing more slugs to infect more people. Cynthia finally leaves Brad after he trip J.C. in front of a crowd. Dude picking on the crippled kids will not win you points with the ladies. Chris finally gathers enough courage to talk to her and she asks him to be her date for the dance. On the night of the big formal the frat guys run into a little bad luck and Detective Landis who has all the best lines says The good news is your dates are here the bad new is their dead. The whole sorority house scene that follows is completely insane and fun to watch.Although made in 1986 this movie feels very modern and way ahead of it's time even if can be very 80's at times. The blood and gore effects are actually quite good considering the meager five million dollar budget they had to work with. It was also made in a time without the aid of computers and CGI. Many horror movies released today are either remakes of popular 80's movies or made to give it the feel of the time period. Looking back who doesn't miss the 80's? I'm laughing on the inside".

The head frat guy is played for a laugh since he is such a clichd stereotype. He is a blonde haired sweater vest wearing guy named Brad. His red sports car even has license plates that say Bradster. What a douche! Anyway Chris has a huge crush on a sorority girl Cynthia but she is also the Bradster girlfriend. Chris and J.C. try to get into a fraternity and must somehow get a dead body and put it another frat houses yard as a pledge. In the college medical research building they find a cryochamber with the frozen body of the infected guy from the '50's. Needless to say he is thawed and escapes to infect the campus. Upon investigating the lab Detective Landis asks the cops Is this a homicide or a bad Bmovie. Director Fred Dekker also wrote the script and has several tonguein cheek scenes and bits of dialogue. Kind of like what the Scream movies did in the mid 90's. The alien slugs go in through your mouth and lay eggs in the unfortunate person's brain turning them into zombies. Their heads eventually wheather shot or hit with an ax explode releasing more slugs to infect more people. Cynthia finally leaves Brad after he trip J.C. in front of a crowd. Dude picking on the crippled kids will not win you points with the ladies. Chris finally gathers enough courage to talk to her and she asks him to be her date for the dance. On the night of the big formal the frat guys run into a little bad luck and Detective Landis who has all the best lines says The good news is your dates are here the bad new is their dead. The whole sorority house scene that follows is completely insane and fun to watch.Although made in 1986 this movie feels very modern and way ahead of it's time even if can be very 80's at times. The blood and gore effects are actually quite good considering the meager five million dollar budget they had to work with. It was also made in a time without the aid of computers and CGI. Many horror movies released today are either remakes of popular 80's movies or made to give it the feel of the time period. Looking back who doesn't miss the 80's? I'm laughing on the inside";

	schema:reviewBody "A vessel containing an intergalactic experiment from an alien spaceship arrives on Earth. Meanwhile a young couple is making out in their car near where it lands. The guy after hearing the strange noise it made goes to investigate. The girl stays behind and is killed by an escaped mental patient with an axe. The guy finds the vessel which opens up and frees an alien slug. The slug then enters his body through the mouth and takes control of his brain. Thirty years later Chris Jason Lively and J.C. Steve Marshall are two college students who while trying to impress a beautiful young coed named Cynthia Jill Whitlow are hazed into leaving a dead body on the sorority house doorstep. They only get as far as the morgue where they find a frozen corpse actually the young man from before and accidentally thaw him out along with the parasite in his brain. Soon the alien slugs multiply and start taking control of all the students around campus resulting in a terrifying zombie crisis. Chris and J.C. join forces with the one liner spitting Detective Ray Cameron Tom Atkins and must now fight to put an end to this threat from beyond the stars! This is one of the greatest horror films I've ever seen and it sickens me how little known it is. This movie has all the right ingredients for Bmovie greatness and is one you will want to watch over and over again. All the characters here really fleshed out and three dimensional. Ray Cameron played by the always great Tom Atkins is hilarious and steals every scene he's in. He's easily one of my favorite horror protagonists ever. I just loved him! Jason Lively as Chris makes for a great hero as well and gave a very grounded and credible performance. I could go on and on about the acting but what really makes this movie so perfect is the intricate premise of alien slugs taking over human bodies and making them into mindless zombies. It's like a clever tribute to the scifi monster movies of the 50's but with an 80's twist. Another cool treat for horror fans like myself is that most of the characters are named after great horror directors such as Carpenter Raimi Cronenberg etc.. Night of the Creeps was definitely made for people who love this sort of thing and I applaud the filmmakers for that. I could write an entire novel about what makes this film so great but I'll go ahead and conclude this review by telling you to check it out immediately. You will not be disappointed!".

	schema:reviewBody "Fred Dekker's Night of the Creeps of 1986 is a hilarious Zombie satire that enjoys an enormous cultstatus among many Horror fans. The film is regarded by some as an absolute cultfavorite of the 80s and sometimes even compared with highlights such as The Evil Dead or ReAnimator. While my personal opinion is that this little gem cannot possibly compete with The Evil Dead or ReAnimator Both personal alltime favorites of mine it is beyond doubt that any Horror lover with a sense of humor will have a blast watching this. The film begins with a hilarious opening sequence in space and the funniestlooking aliens I've ever seen and continues with a blackandwhite prologue set in 1959. At the same time that a murderous psychopath is on the loose a part of an alien experiment falls out of a spaceship and hits earth. Near Corman ! University a guy is befallen by extraterrestrial slugs and hence turned into a zombie. In 1986 two nerds break into a scientific facility and accidentally unfreeze the poor fellow releasing the zombiemaking slugs... The film is great fun to watch from the beginning to the end. Some people seem to regard this as one of the rarities that are funny AND scary at the same time. Well scary is something different in my opinion but the funpart is hilarious and the film enjoyably relies on cool makeup nicelydone gore effects a nice atmosphere eccentric characters macabre humor and memorably funny dialog. The performances are good legendary BMovie star and superbadass Tom Atkins shines as the tough cop Jill Withlow is yummy in the female lead. Jason Lively and Steve Marshall are very believable as the nerdy protagonists and the film even features a cameo appearance by HorrorBMovie legend Dick Miller A Bucket of Blood.... Many of the characters have a tribute as their name Detective Landis Ray Cameron Cynthia Cronenberg Sgt. Raimi Corman University etc. Overall this is a hilarious and extremely entertaining little film that every Horror fan should enjoy. Highly Recommended.".

It was half a century ago but similar garbage is still abundant in cinemas today in the form of drek like Hostel Sorority Row and Final Destination. I guess the older horrors could be forgiven as it was a more innocent time. All Bmovies from day one have been mere potboilers. Is Night of the Creeps an exception? It's hard to review Night of the Creeps. There are many hits and misses. You could let the film off on all counts by claiming that all the goofiness is intentional even when it's not. But the endless references to classic horror films becomes a bit too heavy. I'm not a fan of injokes especially when their nonetoosubtle. They're all over the place in horror films these days so maybe back in 1986 it was regarded as new and clever.The plot is torn right out of a 1950s scifi comic. Aliens lose an experiment while cruising through space and it comes to earth in a cannister where it crash lands in the woods of a quiet little town in 1959. A wholesome teen couple in the middle of makingout go to investigate. The boyfriend is infected with something and the girl is slaughtered by an axemurderer.Flash forward to 1986 and we have a couple of dorks trying desperately to get into a fraternity at their college in order to impress a hot chick. During their hijinks they accidentally thaw the cryogenically frozen body of the wholesome boyfriend who comes back to life. Parasites are controlling his body and an plague of alien slugs slowly spreads across the town.This biggest miss of NOTC is the fact that nothing really becomes of either plot line. The resurrection of the axemurderer goes nowhere and is over as soon as it begins. The slug invasion doesn't add up to much action either. I saw the Director's Cut of the film which has a more conclusive ending and I can't imagine how weak this film would have been in cinemas with the original anticlimatic end.It does has a lot of spirit however. Fred Dekker crams loads of enthusiasm and affection into the 90 minute runtime and the cast seem to be caught up in the high. I've never really liked Jason Lively. His acting abilities are slight and outside of NOTC I've only seen him in European Vacation and Ghost Chase. He's merely okay in NOTC and his tall stature and gangly limbs fit his character. But his costar Steve Marshall acts him off the screen. A friend of Robert Downey Jnr Marshall came to Hollywood at his pal's insistence and within six weeks had a role in this movie. Despite the promising beginning he never made another theatricallyreleased film and has less than ten entries on his filmography. I can't imagine why.Apart from Tom Atkins as a bitter detective you're unlikely to recognise anyone else in this movie. Though David Paymer has a cameo as an unfortunate scientist and Dick Miller appears for a small scene with the same name as the character he played in Roger Corman's Bucket of Blood. Even Fred Dekker himself never prospered as a director. After NOTC he went on to helm The Monster Squad and the exceptionally poor RoboCop 3. NOTC seems to stand out as the defining movie moment for many of those involved.The film itself has been homagedcopied in recent years with James Gunn's Slither which I have never seen. But the tacky 80s edge of NOTC has no modern day equivalent. Barry De Vorzon's score seems a little dated in some places but is otherwise adequate enough. Even De Vorzon's career pretty much ended with this film. He went on to score Exorcist III in 1990 and has done nothing since.Considering the film's cult status and adoration among horror fans it's strange that it effectively killedharmed the careers of everyone involved.As a cheap 80s horror with gory makeup effects and a silly story you're unlikely to find anything better than NOTC. It knows it's dumb and has no delusions of grandeur. If only it had been pushed further it might have ended up being the classic such as those it paid homage to..".

Unfortunately these and but a handful more make up the most interesting moments in this film.

	schema:headline " Mildly entertaining 80's horror trash...";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie has all the right elements and themes for an 80's horror movie. It combines seminaked girls bad hairstyles hilarious fashions a college prom mind you we never get to see this and a hilarious soundtrack that seems to have gathered Men At Worksoundalikes and the main theme which appears to have been recorded directly from a synthesizer!The movie starts off in the 1950's where a young man and his date decide to investigate a grounded unidentified flying object which has come to rest in the middle of a forest. While the boyfriend investigates he leaves his girlfriend in the car who manages to get herself hacked to pieces by a recent asylumescapee wielding an axe complete with a straitjacket!. If this subplot doesn't sound formulaic already the boyfriend investigates the UFO where a 'sluglike' creature shoots into his mouth reminiscent of David Cronenberg's alsohilarious Shivers.Cut to the next scene and we're in the 1980s. One of the most homeliest guys ever to be passed off as a hero wants to ask this girl out who also happens to be dating the most popular boy on campus. Our hero has a funny little sidekick complete with a set of crutches who has a witty comment to make every 2 seconds. The two guys think that the best way to get this girl out on a date is to join her boyfriend's fraternity. The only task they have to complete to join the fraternity is to steal a corpse from the science labs. Of course when they enter the laboratory which is supposed to be under maximum hitech security they stumble through an open door while the onduty scientist is busy making a phonecall and discover a body in a cryogenics chamber. The laboratory has a lot of consoles and funny flashing lights reminiscent to the consoles on the set of Battlestar Galactica. Of course there is a big red button on the wall that says deregulate and whaddya know. Before you know it the body is released from the chamber. Little do the two guys know that the body is the boyfriend from the 1950s chapter of the movie and that he is not dead at all.Cut to the next scene our two heroes run screaming from the laboratory and our dead friend is shooting a slug from his mouth into the mouth of the scientist seconds before his head explodes even more slugs. The slugs apparently control the brain much like The Puppetmasters and use the brain and body as an incubating chamber to breed more sluglike creatures and when manifesting explode from the cranium in a shower of blood and gore.The rest of the movie basically feeds off dead plots like Night Of The Living Dead and The Pod People. Person runs into dead person. Slug goes into mouth. Person becomes dead person. There are a lot of plot holes. There is no explanation as to why the boyfriend from the 1950s was in a cryogenics chamber in the first place. Why he didn't attack the persons who found him and why being frozen stopped the slugs in his brain. According to the slugs it doesn't matter if you're crippled from the waist down or dead even. They know how to control the body.Some of the best scenes involve the resurrection of the asylumescapee from the 1950s an axe through the head of the sorority house mother a dead dog who infects a busload of dead frathouse prom dates and a vengeful cop who takes it upon himself to destroy the slugs in the basement of a house with a drum of kerosene and his trusty cigar. Watch what happens to him at the end!The film's weakest points is the story's hero. You won't find yourself sympathising with him or his sidekick much. The film's heroine is just another cardboard cut out of a ditzy brunette who doesn't know how to operate a flame thrower like who doesn't!!. There is one scene where the story's hero and the girl he loves gets trapped in a garden shed. The scene is so pathetic you don't know whether you should be angry at the fact that she didn't blast the zombies with the flame thrower before going into the shed or the fact that our hero decides to run over a zombie's head with a lawnmower after he has been told that the only way the slugs will die is by fire. Neither of these two characters have much common sense.Which brings me to the conclusion of my comment on this movie. Watch it for laughs only. If you try to treat this semiserious like one of those well maybe it could happen scenarios you will only be fooling yourself. Try not to rent it on video. Try to catch it late at night on television. It pops up every now and then. Just be warned that you won't see any signs of Mulder Scully or Doggett making any cameos.610".

Now the alien slugs are free and attacking the college campus turning people into zombies. After his friend is killed Chris tries to stop the slugs  zombies with the help of a detective Tom Atkins whose tragic backstory ties into the alien attack in 1959.This terrific '80s horror comedy from Fred Dekker is one of the most underrated movies from that decade. Steve Marshall is great fun as the handicapped best friend of 'the hero.' He gets many of the movie's best lines. Jason Lively and beautiful Jill Whitlow are both good. Allan Kayser Bubba from Mama's Family is the Zabkaesque jock villain. The movie's highlight is Tom Atkins who gives a memorable performance as the tough and sarcastic detective. The movie's filled with injokes and references that genre fans will enjoy. The movie itself is a sort of homage to classic B scifihorror flicks of the '50s. By the way in one scene Jill Whitlow is making cookies or something in the kitchen with her sorority sisters. She drops a wooden spoon and kicks it under the refrigerator. Then she picks it up and proceeds to put it right back in the bowl. Eww how gross is that? That made me want to vomit far more than any of the movie's special effects! Give it a shot and I'm sure you'll agree it's great fun and years ahead of its time. Any movie with a Dick Miller cameo can't be that bad.".

The movie relies on a very good direction photography music good dialogs but as I said what makes the movie likable is that is very entertaining and catches you in every moment from the beginning to the end. Besides the acting is really good and realist which is another strong point for the movie. Although there's no hero in this movie the characters are kind of lovable. One thing that I didn't fully understood is why do they present the two kids in the beginning if they are going to tell with more importance the story of only one of them I understand that is for knowing their past and it helps to understand a lot but one of the boys doesn't get the same importance of the other. And tough in the end in the part of the bus assault there are some things rushed and that doesn't fit well it's very good and engaging. I don't know what else to say it is simply a very good movie that tells the life story of two children from the favelas of Rio De Janeiro and it's very good to see good stories about this subjects.".

This is just one more of the Brazilian 'reality' movies which sends any Hollywood crime story to kindergarten. 'Good' thing about Hollywood work is that you go and sleep after watching a movie but this Brazilian film reality is so convincing that really shocks you and stays after the film. That is the difference between being entertained and being moved. Thumbs up for that considering the fact that we do not watch a documentary while the movie is made real as one. Excellent portrait of the society and its structural relations. Superb acting and very good directing.".

	onyx:emotionText "Very well done more than convincing. Rio shown with no softeners as a place where life doesn't worth much. This is just one more of the Brazilian 'reality' movies which sends any Hollywood crime story to kindergarten. 'Good' thing about Hollywood work is that you go and sleep after watching a movie but this Brazilian film reality is so convincing that really shocks you and stays after the film. That is the difference between being entertained and being moved. Thumbs up for that considering the fact that we do not watch a documentary while the movie is made real as one. Excellent portrait of the society and its structural relations. Superb acting and very good directing.";

I couldn't understand very well what was going on but when I realized all TV channels stopped their programming to show this I just didn't know what to think.I have watched the movie 2 days ago. Because I can remember the occurred so vividly in my mind even I being very young at the time I cried at the end. As I said I didn't know what to think at the time but now I feel sorry for Sandro for everything that he had passed through and that culminated in the hijack.The movie is very realistic at some points like when Sandro is inside the bus for it was like all was happening again I was watching saying Now he'll do this she'll do that so well I could remember but it fails in another points. There are many historic mistakes The Candelria slaughter occurred in 1993 not in 2000 Sandro didn't see his mother when she is already dead he saw her being decapitated when he was 6 and he never was mistaken by another boy because the other boy Alessandro didn't exist ok this was something created by the writer to become the story more dramatic but it wasn't necessary since Sandro's story is dramatic for itself.I liked the movie but for those who doesn't know the whole story since the beginning it may be difficult to understand why some things happened.".

It is about a poor boy Sandro who hijacks a bus and takes few hostages only in order to be famous and due he's high. So everyone must watch it. It's a portrait about an unfortunate guy who didn't have another choice in life except being a thief. Otherwise he'd die. In other words he didn't have a chance to live honestly. The movie has the usual and expected sad ending. Michel Gomes is the main actor who did a great work besides some of other unknown actors. Maybe it could be a good lesson for those who intends to track a wrong way. As a matter of fact Sandro had tried to have a better life but it seems destiny or fate did not allow him. In short it happens nowadays in every country where poverty turns to a plague. Again good direction and good actors. I'm sure an awarding is coming to this very film!".

	schema:headline " Good action thriller but not quite the riveting export material it might like to be";
	schema:reviewBody "The number 174 bus may well forever be remembered as the most famous hijack in Brasil. National television gave it hours of live coverage. Rio de Janeiro police desperately tried to free hostages. The ordeal was imprinted on the national psyche much the way 911 is on America's. First a documentary and now this major film.I did once experience an attempted hijack in Brasil. Coming off a slip road from Presidente Vargas. The same freeway where part of this film is located. About twenty young kids none of them more than twelve years old charge our fastmoving vehicle. They run headon towards us in a vformation attempting to make the bus brake hard. Or crash. It's 2am. I'm on my way back to the apartment after late night carousing. Passengers rise in their seats. Transfixed. We wait to see what the driver will do. Instead of stopping he accelerates towards the children. It resembles a game of dare but with deadly intent. The phalanx of charging youngsters scatters at the very last minute. Sighs of relief. If he had stopped the chances of being robbed at gunpoint would have been high.The famous 174 incident ended in bloodshed. It was made into the documentary Onibus 174 which did rather well and also inspired this film. Last Stop 174 a feature thriller that culminates in the same event has much to live up to.Our action starts with Alessandro rudely ripped from his mother's breast quite literally. The gangsters that grab him violently are owed money by his cokesniffing mama. Young Alessandro Sandro for short is soon old enough to wield a gun. His life soon intertwines with another boy called Sandro as they grow up on the streets doing coke and doing time. They survive by armed robbery and dealing drugs. A close shave with an infamous street massacre just off Presidente Vargas in Rio's city centre sees several children gunned down. Between the bloodbath of juveniles and the bus hijack weave tales of maternal longing desperate gluesniffing jailbreak and prostitution. Meanwhile Church and NGOs fight to save souls among such unworthy miscreants.As a straightforward action movie Last Stop 174 is gritty and entertaining. The pace doesn't let up and the central characters give a convincing demonstration of Brasil's brand of smoothtalking hustlers. But does the film have more to it than just box office returns? Our young actors do well  on many an occasion  but at other times seem noticeably stretched. It seems a good enough story yet is really a collection of interlocking pieces rather than a smoothly flowing whole. The actual hijack is a relatively short segment at the end of the film  and it left me a little underwhelmed. I had been very much looking forward to Last Stop 174. Yet on viewing I felt it had little new to say. In fact very little to say at all. Additionally my sympathies are moving towards some of the more arthouse type directors from Brasil. Ones that deplore the way their multifaceted country is depicted as a violent thirdworld outback.You could imagine the anger if the bulk of mainstream film from the UK for instance portrayed nothing but Trainspotting and underbellies of drug orgies and football violence. The Rio city centre carnage should be shocking  since such things normally only happen when they do happen in underprivileged favelas the slums of Brasil. Not in the midst of a teeming financial district. But this film sadly gives us no context to draw such contrasts. We see mostly only slum boys sleeping on pavements and selling their heavilycut coke. Characters outside their world of the dispossessed have little more than walkon parts.The plot is overcomplicated by having two boys of similar names. And there is confusion rather than mystery over who is the real mother. The mishmash result is lack of momentum for the main storyline. This should be Sandro's boyhood culminating in a botched robbery and hijack of bus 174.Not that there aren't fascinating details. Contricks used to steal a Copacabana woman's handbag. Or an ingenious ruse for the mass egress from prison when they scam and overpower guards and staff. Earlier Sandro loses his virginity at a tender age. To a prostitute he promptly falls in love with. Patchy performances of inspired intensity outweigh an attempt at a sustained ensemble endeavour. From the opening scenes which have genuine shock value the drive towards a finale is uneven at best. The film's target audience is unclear being too welltrodden for many mainstream viewers and lacking the subtlety demanded by arthouse crowds. Last Stop 174 if not quite grinding to a halt never manages to make a smooth transition through its gears.".

	schema:reviewBody "I rarely post things on internet blogs but this is a bit of a concern of mine. I am worried that beautiful films such as L'Infant are going to now be classified in the same category as Juno. I understand the mass appeal of this movie the mainstream audience being confused and thinking it's an indie flick by the gritty film used and the obscure references but Juno is in no way an independent film. I think why it is so ineffective is because the audience it was trying to attract the movie fanatics who hate big budget Hollywood junk i.e. anything with Jessica alba in it saw it for what it really was Hollywood junk wrapped up in a converse shoelace bow. It was as indie as Avril is punk rock.Furthermore it is in my opinion a tasteless pointless movie. For the majority of the film I am more annoyed with Juno than I am sympathetic to her plight. I also have a hard time relating to her as she is NOT a 16year old but rather a 35year olds characterization of a 16 year old does this make sense? I have NEVER heard a teenager  young adult in my life ever utter ridiculous lines such as honest to blog? or yea I'm total forshiz. What the hell? I thought maybe a stripper turned blogger would have been a little more able to develop a story with characters that are down to earth but this Juno character is absurd.Plus the rest of the film is completely underdeveloped you never see the relationship with her stepmother develop or understand why it is the way it is. Her relationship with bleaker has maybe 25 minutes but it is in no way a developed understood relationship. In fact he's barely even seen! The summary of the movie includes the words and with her beautiful friends help but in the movie there is absolutely no connection with her friends beauty and the relevance of it. Was there supposed to be some conflict? All these story arcs that were never completed.I was very disappointed with this movie. Fox searchlight has produced many good films notes on a scandal little miss sunshine the last king of Scotland etc but this is just an embarrassment. It wasn't as though the actors were bad Michael Cera as usual plays the adorable awkward adolescent and Ellen page Jason Batemen Jennifer Gardner etc play their roles respectively but the whole premise of the movie was so over the top and unrealistic. Oscar worthy? It's ludicrous. This is a movie worth missing.".

I understand the mass appeal of this movie the mainstream audience being confused and thinking it's an indie flick by the gritty film used and the obscure references but Juno is in no way an independent film. I think why it is so ineffective is because the audience it was trying to attract the movie fanatics who hate big budget Hollywood junk i.e. anything with Jessica alba in it saw it for what it really was Hollywood junk wrapped up in a converse shoelace bow. It was as indie as Avril is punk rock.Furthermore it is in my opinion a tasteless pointless movie. For the majority of the film I am more annoyed with Juno than I am sympathetic to her plight. I also have a hard time relating to her as she is NOT a 16year old but rather a 35year olds characterization of a 16 year old does this make sense? I have NEVER heard a teenager  young adult in my life ever utter ridiculous lines such as honest to blog? or yea I'm total forshiz. What the hell? I thought maybe a stripper turned blogger would have been a little more able to develop a story with characters that are down to earth but this Juno character is absurd.Plus the rest of the film is completely underdeveloped you never see the relationship with her stepmother develop or understand why it is the way it is. Her relationship with bleaker has maybe 25 minutes but it is in no way a developed understood relationship. In fact he's barely even seen! The summary of the movie includes the words and with her beautiful friends help but in the movie there is absolutely no connection with her friends beauty and the relevance of it. Was there supposed to be some conflict? All these story arcs that were never completed.I was very disappointed with this movie. Fox searchlight has produced many good films notes on a scandal little miss sunshine the last king of Scotland etc but this is just an embarrassment. It wasn't as though the actors were bad Michael Cera as usual plays the adorable awkward adolescent and Ellen page Jason Batemen Jennifer Gardner etc play their roles respectively but the whole premise of the movie was so over the top and unrealistic. Oscar worthy? It's ludicrous. This is a movie worth missing.";

	schema:reviewBody "What is it about any movie that shows a hip white woman bringing her baby to term that causes film critics to temporarily lose their minds? Knocked Up was given a free pass and Juno is inspiring some of the worst film criticism I've ever seen.The truth is that Juno is a calculatedly juvenile film with an immensely appealing main actress Ellen Page fake metadialog and an inability to followthrough on its central theme of abandonment.Juno is constructed so as to allow moviegoers to feel as if they've gone through a significant emotional journey without doing the work. One way it blunts serious emotions is through the use of hipster patois in the place of real dialog. Rob Harvilla a music critic with the Village Voice described this bestTeenagers who talk like thirtysomething screenwriters. Cool parents who talk like teenage screenwriters. A 16yearold heroine who actually says things like Just looking to secure a hasty abortion! and Just dealing with things way outside my maturity level! and grits teeth Swear to blog!. Just appallingly cute cute cute CUTE CUTE. The cutesy dialog has been universally panned in reviews but its also serving to throw critics off serious discussion of the film's major shortcomings. A.O. Scott in the New York Times...not many are so daring in their treatment of teenage pregnancy which this film flirts with presenting not just as bearable but attractive. Kids please! Heed the cautionary whale. But in the meantime have a good time at Juno. Bring your parents too. Scott cannot resist writing in a similar style to the dialog in fact thinking in this teenage way. Heed the cautionary whale. But in the meantime have a good time at Juno. I don't know anyone personally who has brought a pregnancy to term and given up her baby but I can imagine it's a lot more painful and less attractive than is portrayed in Juno. No amount of squiggly animated fonts and warbly hypersincere outsiderstyle singing can make up for that fact and pretending otherwise is the opposite of daring.At one point in the film after he adoptive couple has seen their relationship dissolve the character Juno gives voice to the main point of the movie. She says something like I just want to know that love can last. That two people can love each other and it's not going to go away. A moviesequence childbirth follows then a shot of Juno saying she does not want to see her newborn followed by a single tear coursing down her face. Cut to a postpartum Juno happily riding her bike spitting wisecracks and singing twee duets with the afraidofhisownshadow Paul Cera.I'm not being a moralist here I don't want to see the character Juno punished for giving up her baby. But it's an unsatisfying experience to have the main theme of the movie evaporate and to instead be fed a dose of indy candy rather than a resolution or at least a coherent point of view. Critics have responded to this shortcoming by either ignoring it  offering as Scott does a blithe positive assessment of the films earnestness or else as Stephanie Zacharek does in Salon constructing tortuous filmic criticismJuno is partly about the necessity of making choices for ourselves but it's also about knowing when we need to accept help from others. That idea is never spelled out in so many words it comes through in the actors' faces. Language is the house man lives in JeanLuc Godard told us borrowing from Martin Heidegger in Two or Three Things I Know About Her. There are lots of words in Juno. But in the end it's really all about language. OK I'm going to let the royal we pass. Her evasive argument reminds me of coldreadings by psychics who employ verbal tricks to keep their marks engaged you're a shy person but if it's something you care about you have strong opinions although you mainly keep them to yourself but when the chips are down... Zacharek's version is it's all about language but not the talking kind but instead the kind you find in actor's faces when they are letting you know they need help which is really what it's all about just ask JeanLuc Godard when he borrows from Martin Heiddeger. Anything to keep abandonment at bay.Perhaps it's a zeitgeist thing there seems to be a generalized post 911 anxiety about the future of mankind for example the spate of recent movies about apocalyptic threats to civilization cf. Cloverfield I am Legend. Combine this with roleuncertainty created by modern decisions to delay childbearing cf. Lori Gottlieb's article Marry Him in the Atlantic Monthly and the result may be that a simple squigglylined movie about a young woman's lack of anxiety in furthering the human race has an appeal that is irresistible.

	schema:reviewBody "Look I do get it. I fully appreciate that a film about a girl who gets pregnant has an early abortion then manages to move on would be a pretty short movie. In fact so short it wouldn't get made. No one wants to know about reality. And certainly in 21st century North America no one wants to portray abortion as a viable option. Very very bad form currently.But when I see this film reviewed as blazingly truthful and the pregnant 16 year old central character described as being 'in a pickle' as I did in one review as if perhaps she'd forgotten a homework assignment and might get detention I have to admit that the cynic who lurks in my soul gets full rein. This is basically a cutesy film about being pregnant at 16 where despite a few problems everyone gets to live pretty much happily ever after. Gosh girl in a pickle comes good! Ahhh!! And apparently everyone in the cinema where I saw it was quite overwhelmed by attacks of the warm fuzzies except me. Two seats away a woman slightly older than me was weeping joyfully by the end while behind me young women were giggling happily as sweet Juno's bump grew. Good grief! Is this really a message we want to give to 16 year olds? I'm beginning to think I'm something of an oddity. You see I don't find it 'blazingly truthful' that a bright resourceful and articulate 16 year old as Juno is portrayed would be so dumb as to have inadequately protected sex then seem surprised to find herself up the spout. One point of the script is that Juno herself apparently initiated the sex thought it through in advance in fact because she was bored. I therefore assume the pregnancy was at least to some extent planned. And if she really had no idea that sex might lead to pregnancy her parents portrayed as bemused but supportive should be excoriated for such inadequate parenting. And if I see one more review which describes Juno as a comedy about growing up 'and the bumps along the way.' I'm prepared to bet good money on that having been written by a middle aged man I swear I'm going to run amok in the local mall with a urine dip stick. Being pregnant at 16 isn't a sweet joke abortion clinics whatever you think of their morality  and I'm neutral on that are not run by morons and while Juno has some amusing oneliners and a good central performance from Ellen Page it is basically a deeply flawed superficial movie which is trying too hard to be cute. It's extremely manipulative.I'm going to be very controversial and suggest that far from being surprised by an unplanned pregnancy Juno might actually be a very willful young woman who wants to add pregnancychildbirthadoption to her 'experimentsinliving' list. At everyone else's expense. It certainly makes her the center of attention. She wouldn't be the first girl to get pregnant for that reason.I found the situation between the adoptive parents more convincing. Childless Vanessa Jennifer Garner is desperate for a baby. Husband Mark is not so sure and does at least eventually face up to the truth of his uncertainty by making a break for it. He may be 40 going on 18 but he's being honest about it. And for me the most moving scene in the whole film was when Vanessa held the newborn child in her arms for the first time having decided to go it alone as a mother anyway. If there is a message to be taken from this movie it's possibly that becoming a mother when the time is right is just fine. A superficial cutesy lightweight movie. The fact it was written by a woman is no excuse. I am gobsmacked that it's been nominated.".

As others have mentioned Juno has an ironic hamburger phone wears ironic tshirts featuring 70's era toys Slinky wears Converse sneakers and can't seem to have a conversation without making popculture references no matter what is going on  even when her water breaks and she is headed to the hospital she has the detached sense of irony to make a reference to a mid80's cartoon yelling Thundercats are go! I cringed again. I get it  Juno is a hip snarky ironic tough coolbecauseshetryingnottobecool chick. But she becomes a cartoon a warped caricature of an actual quirky kid. I could not accept Juno as real and was painfully aware that I was watching a movie.And that is my ONLY problem with the film. The other characters and their stories are amazing  particularly the adoptive couple and the difficulties they are facing. The best parts of the movie are those few moments when Juno gets her uberironic self off the screen and we get to enjoy the other more realistic characters.Would have given this a 8.5 if not for the cartoonishness of the Juno character.

The script by Diablo Cody is rich with oneliners anyone who's read Candy Girl which is unbelievably intelligent and funny her description of Shania Twain especially had me rolling will kind of know what to expect.This is without a doubt Ellen Page's show. She's in almost every scene and I couldn't spot an instalnce when she made a bad decision or timed a delivery anything but deadon. During a funky kick azz opening title sequence Juno is on her way to the pharmacy. I just drank my weight in Sunny D and gotta go pronto! It's time for another pregnancy test because the last result looked more like a division symbol than a plus sign. New stick same plus.The father's a guy Juno had sex with once upon a time who also happens to be her best friend Paulie Bleeker a nonaffected quite bland Michael Cera. She decides to give it up for adoption being 16 and all which Paulie supports  as do Juno's father and stepmom  and the rest of the film is about her selection of adoptive parents.Pretty straightforward storytelling but with an ear for quirky hip dialogue. If the spoken words were any more cool or the actors speaking them did so with any less suave my gag reflex might have taken over. The AFF audience I saw it with last Sunday couldn't get enough from the second Juno tells a dog to shut up through lines comparing babies to iPods and Alison Janney going off on a physician.There's good stuff here. And even though it never really swept me off my feet the film is consistently humorous and in one scene near the end somewhat heartbreaking.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is way overhyped. Most of the time I was just annoyed by most of the things on the screen.First of all the dialog is something a 16 year old girl would never say. Too hip witty and glib for anybody. She sounded like she was reading a screenplay which she was. I mean it was sssooo bad that it took me out of the picture. Right then it could no longer be a semi serious drama. I think it was trying to be an updated version of Heathers but failed miserably.Then startup the eclectic cool indie music stolen out of a Wes Anderson movie. I love Wes' movies but Juno is not that its a wannabe. The hip music comes on all the time to fill in the missing script no doubt. At the end of the film maybe the last 510 minutes there must be about 57 different songs one after another each for a different sequence. It was way too much. What do you do when you cant raise the emotion with dialog put in music and lots of it. Once you pay attention to it its almost laughable. Its about the only thing I laughed at in this movie.Another Wes Anderson ripoff was the runners running through the movie. This reminded me of Tenebaums with the gypsy taxi gag.And lastly. She finally decides she's in love still treating the guy like crap and always will. They should have a sequel to this crap movie where 3 days later they break up because she's cursing Bleeker out and treating him with contempt.This movie was a loser in every way and not a indie movie. This thing was marketed to death.".

	schema:reviewBody "At first blush Juno seems like a pretty great movie. It's entertaining and lots of fun to watch. There's a great cast and each of the film's characters are wellsketched and interesting. Firstrate cinematography keeps the film colorful and engaging from start to finish. There are more than enough quirks witty dialogues and obscure namedroppings to keep the hipsters placated. Perhaps it's just a bit pretentious and tries just a bit too hard but these flaws could be overlooked. The movie should have been a charming little indielite film.But it's not. Ultimately I stepped out of the theater feeling frustrated and unsatisfied. The problem is that Juno tackles two very relevant issues in today's society  namely abortion and teenage pregnancy  and utterly fails to address either in a way that is realistic or compelling. Now maybe it's unfair to expect Juno to make a decent exploration of these complex themes. It's just a comedy after all. However even as many critics praise the movie's keen humor and witty banter it's hard not to get caught up in the fact that this movie painfully abuses these highly relevant issues.In one particularly winceworthy scene Juno's stepmother tells off an ultrasound technician for indicating that teenage mothers are less capable of taking care of their kids than adults. She argues that teenagers could be just as devoted to their children as their adult counterparts and that she should stick to the things that she knows about. Instead of defending her position the technician wordlessly exits while Juno her friend and her stepmother exchange verbal highfives.The film makes offers no exploration of the ultrasound technician's completely valid viewpoint. Are teenagers ready to leave school to get a job and start supporting a dependent of their own? Are these kids really mature enough to tackle these issues? Should they have to? Does the amount of devotion to the baby really matter when you can hardly afford food and shelter? These relevant questions are left unasked. The scene is telling of either the director's ignorance or else his pointed attempt to skew facts to make a point and neither shines well on the movie.Juno MacGuff seems to be living in a dream world. Never mind her ridiculous vocabulary or unrealistically snappy sarcasm  her parents barely react to the news of her pregnancy she almost effortlessly finds parents to adopt her unborn child in a newspaper want ad no less the legal issues are smoothed out in the span of 30 seconds and Juno's social ostracism is hinted at but hardly explored in any meaningful way. Instead of getting a believable portrayal of teenage pregnancy the film offers the pretentious namedropping of hip punk bands. At one point Juno actually says Sonic Youth is just noise as a biting insult. It's all a tad ridiculous.At the end of the day perhaps none of this should interfere with enjoyment of the movie. Perhaps one should gloss over the film's aggravating biases and enjoy what is otherwise a great film. However the fact remains that Juno passes itself as an artsy independent film about teenage pregnancy and abortion but it is little more than a shallow poorly considered exploitation of these important issues.".

The acting by Ellen Page was outstanding I had no clue who Ellen Page was  I have since watched Hard Candy. I can't remember a film that I was so drawn in by the main character.I've always told friends for me the mark of a good movie is the character actors and their performances. They all deliver in this movie. I'm not going to go overboard and say its the best movie this year but it is one that I would recommend.

	schema:headline " If you loved Superbad and Knocked Up... Ah screw it! The movie sucked.";
	schema:reviewBody "This weekend my girlfriend drove down from Purdue visit me here at good old IU she's transferring next year thank God. Apparently Purdue has some schoolsanctioned P2P video sharing software that she recently got hold of. At a friend's suggestion she downloaded Juno and wanted to watch it with me. I personally thought the movie was a little too chickflicky for me but I absolutely LOVED Superbad proud owner of the DVD tshirt and theatrical poster so I thought What the hell it has Michael Cera and it'll make my girl happy. After watching the movie I felt the need to watch Superbad again and make sure the same actor that was hysterical in that movie could possibly be the bland unfunny male lead in Juno. Thankfully I wasn't alone. My girlfriend shared my sentiments as well so i didn't feel like a total ahole.First of all I consider myself a bit of a music nerd or Nazi as my girlfriend suggests. I read in an internet headline somewhere a while ago that Cera showcases his musical talents in Juno and thought that was pretty cool. But I was wrong... dead wrong. The soundtrack in the movie made me want to bash my acoustic against my car so I could never accidentally play any chords reminiscent of the abomination to music I heard in that movie. Anyone who could listen to that music and say to themselves Hey this is awesome is either A. Under the age of 6. B. Have the mental capacity of a 6yearold. C. Tripping on mushrooms D. Lying to himselfherself.The movie itself was hardly amazing. All the characters were next to impossible to relate to. Cera's character even though he was supposedly Page's character's best friend was next to worthless when it came to plot development... If Juno was impregnated by some nameless father who is briefly mentioned the movie would have changed very little. Her family is weakly developed as well. Her halfsister is mentioned maybe 3 times and shown even less. It would have been very interesting to see the dynamic relationship between pregnant older sister and innocent younger sister but nothing is shown.The adopting couple are the only interesting characters in the whole damn movie. I was way more interested in the backstory of these two but nothing is given about Jennifer Garner's character and Jason Bateman's character is way more interesting than the few paragraphs of backstory we are given on him. I would have loved to see his transition from underground rocker to corporate sellout but yet again I'm disappointed. Hell if the entire movie revolved around these two and Juno was only a minor character my review would probably be a lot different.Enough with the popculture references already!!! There is a time and place for them and that's usually in an animated comedy like Family Guy love it!!! or The Simpsons. Movies like Epic Movie Date Movie Scary Movie and Meet the Spartans prove this time and time again. If it's longer than an hour keep the references out of it. Superbad was hilarious and the only reference I can think of is one about Orson Wells which the target demographic would probably be clueless about.The characters were so unbelievable it was sickening. Besides the young couple there wasn't a single character I could look at and say That character totally reminds me of fill in the blank. Juno tries to be too many personalities at once. One moment she's stupid and obnoxious then she's sarcastic and nonchalant and all of a sudden she's calm and rational. I can understand having a deep and complex main character but when the character jumps from one extreme to the next in the same scene it gets really tiring really fast. Cera's character Bleeker is so mundane and boring it's inconceivable how the two of them could be friends aside from the fact that absolutely no one under the age of 45 would wear shorts like the track team that he runs for wears in fact i have no clue where someone would buy shorts like that.I've seen that a lot of people were bitching about the film's prolife agenda. While I think it's disgusting that someone could be mad about that I thought the movie was totally indifferent to the subject. It made abortion protesters look like clueless morons with no support while it made the clinics look like they're run by incompetent and unsympathetic jerks. While both of these are untrue in real life and the movie is obviously attempting to satirize the two the way the movie goes about it is so unfunny that most people don't even get the joke. In fact the only reason I could find that Juno would walk out of the clinic is simply because the movie would be too short.Allinall the movie is a letdown. It's obviously targeted to highschool and college girls and tries to make anyone who dislikes it feel like they're out of the loop. It doesn't surprise me one bit that this thing was given an Oscar nomination. It's mostly because a comedy can't be funny if it wants to win Best Comedy and Juno is definitely a prime candidate for that.".

I realize it's a movie and is not necessarily expected to be realistic but it is so far from reality and not in a good way that it's just annoying. The character of Juno occasionally resembles a realistic teenager but most of the time is just a caricature of some type of person I have never seen or heard of in real life. The soundtrack blows. The whole movie is some pretentious attempt to be cool and artsy and instead just comes across as really silly.The only person I found redeeming in this movie was Jason Bateman. He's a great actor and brings a little reality to an otherwise ABSURD movie. To be honest I really hate this movie because with the cast it had it could have been sooooo much better.".

	schema:reviewBody "How original. A teenage girl who has the old soul vibe to her and for no explained reason has knowledge of '77 Punk though she was born in the '90's and her dimwitted blonde friend sure doesn't know who Richard Hell would be. This movie is almost a slap in the face to anyone who has a good set of morals. Her only options are to go to an abortion clinic or give the baby up to spoiled yuppies? The basically uninformed and shy Michael cera has basically no say in anything until all her options run out and then she decides that they must have been in love all along. And the comments she makes while getting her ultrasound are borderline offensive and her mom had no right to stick up for her daughters constantly talking and babbling mouth. The fact that ANY teenager would actually act and talk like Juno is a farce. She even keeps stopping by the adopters house unannounced and basically hitting or flirting with Jason Bateman who is supposed to be adopting this baby! And OF COURSE the parents are not only supportive but have plenty of wacky looks and oneliners themselves. The soundtrack is even worse then the crappy dialogue in this movie. I left this movie feeling insulted and the lack of 'moral' to this story is ????? That you try two different ways to ditch your own kid who she always refers to as it and when nothing works you go to the original father and say lucky you! Even the sex that took place was nonemotional and scary to think that high schoolers would just do it so casually like that. And why are people putting associating the word indie w this movie? It has major stars in it and looks pro. If I could of ripped my head from my body and thrown it at the screen in order to get this movie to stop I would have. Ellen Page deserves cutout bargain bin for this movie not any awards. Her performance was of utter annoyance. Maybe the american pie movie crowd likes this but if you are a true lover of film....skip it!".

	schema:reviewBody "We've all done it. We've had that little moment where we think we're clever. We will jot down a poem a short story or maybe even direct a super poignant student film and try to amaze everyone with our talents. After blowing smoke up our own butts for a while most of us come back to earth fairly easily. Sometimes we'll look back on these moments years later and say Ah. My youth. How foolish I was back then.. and enjoy a bit of nostalgia. Juno is what happens when that moment festers long enough to make it to the big screen.In the first line of the movie the titular Juno claims that it all started with a chair. I'm thinking it really started with a very pretentious writer named Brook BuseyHunt a woman who refers to herself as Diablo Cody and wrote a memoir when she was only 24 if you want an idea of just how pretentious she is saying to herself Tee hee! What a neat idea I've just had! A movie that ends with the same thing it begins with! I'm a genius! This is pretty much the feeling I got throughout the film a movie constantly in awe of itself. A movie THINKING it's clever instead of actually making an honest attempt to BE clever. And as with many films these days it's designed to be College Kid Quote Fodder. As such Juno has received much critical acclaim and yet another bad example of how to make a movie is made. An example that will be copied and recycled to the point of obscenity. If you need proof look no further than Juno itself which feels largely derivative of films such as Napoleon Dynamite.It's hard for me to point out anything good about this flick as nearly every moment of it is so overflowing with arrogance and self indulgence that the finer details are scarcely visible. There were a few moments here and there that made me sort've laugh. Not an audible haha laugh. Just that little inner laugh where you blow air through your nose once. Most of the dialog is very gimmicky and focuses on making young hipsters feel cool because they have knowledge of semicurrent popular culture and the popular culture of yesteryear. Nearly every line is like something out of an episode of Robot Chicken Venture Brothers or Family Guy and the young ignorant edgy 20somethings who are lauding this film as a masterpiece gorge themselves on that sort of thing. The THUNDERCATS ARE GO! line alone is going to ensure that Juno will be recorded in the annals of history amongst those who wear Vote for Pedro tshirts and grown women who still wear those annoying multicolored striped socks with all the toes. And there are lot of you. I see you at the mall hanging out in front of HotTopic all the time. And man Sweeny Todd and Juno at the same time? You guys must be having a liturgy.See? I just did it right there. I was being a snide little jerk who thinks he's funny. But the difference here is that this is just a review soon to be flamed and forgotten whereas Juno is currently ranked as the 129th greatest movie of all time at IMDb. That might not sound like a big deal but bare in mind that this puts it above such films as The Gladiator Annie Hall The Deer Hunter Life of Brian The Princess Bride.. and well I don't even want to continue this list. It's too depressing.The film isn't a total loss. There are some decent performances at the very least. Most notably we have Juno's parents played by J.K. Simmons who many will remember as Jamison from the Spiderman trilogy and the West Wing's Allison Janney. Their characters were funny sincere and had the only worthwhile lines in the film. The wouldbe parents of Juno's unborn child played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are also played fairly well though Garner definitely feels more than a bit out of place. The problem is that as convincing and adorable as these characters are they're peripheral characters with very little to offer. As a matter of fact the only character in this film who doesn't feel peripheral is Juno herself played by Ellen Page. Page's performance is a tough one for me to slam because I can't quite tell if she's just wooden or if she's struggling with the awful novelty dialog Brook BuseyHunt wrote for her. The other characters aren't so much characters as they are caricatures and also feel largely peripheral and derivative even Juno's key love interest in the film.In the end Juno is just another film to provide young adults something to quote in front of their friends so they sound funny. But because the young people of this generation are so pertinacious and precious Juno is adored by them and will probably go down in history as a masterpiece along with similar College Kid Quote Fodder movies like 300 Borat and Napoleon Dynamite. I was recommended this movie by a friend and I was somewhat excited to see it after seeing all the raving in its wake. I won't say for certain that you should or shouldn't see this film. If you think shows like the Venture Brothers or Family Guy are the zenith of comic genius you will love this movie and by all means go see it. If you're a bit less juvenile and have a taste for real comedy like the works of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks Juno might leave you pretty confused and 8 bucks poorer to boot. Go see Walk Hard instead while you still can. You'll at least get a good laugh which is what comedy aims for and something Juno fails at miserably.".

This movie was really boring especially towards the end where I was practically falling asleep and this wasn't due to a lack of sleep! The dialog in this movie is what makes it boring ... a pure sleeper! The acting was average at best. Ellen Page's performance gets pretty annoying after about 10 minutes further ruining the viewing experience.Furthermore the movie was way too long. Perhaps if they shortened up the dialog and added some more action into it it would have improved it.In terms of novelty there is none. The movies adds nothing to previous ones in the genre.".

She is not kicked out of school or ostracized by her classmates her parents are supportive the boyfriend doesn't disappear on her and the adoptive couple while facing their own problems don't turn out to be too bad.So essentially what we have is the after school special about teen pregnancy or one of a thousand Lifetime channel stories on the same topic but minus most of the conflict. Its also minus what seems to me to be the real life emotion 16 year old girls would go through if this happened to them and any of the self doubt that goes with the decision to give up their baby.Lastly comes the question of whether any sixteen year old would be as self assured and well rounded as this girl?

From the moment she confirms the unwelcome news Juno studies her options  abortion raising the child as a single teen parent adoption  then takes matters into her own hands. Like the Roman goddess who is her namesake Juno is a bright often sharptongued individual who prides herself on her observant cynicism and her way with a sarcastic quip. However she's not above appealing to the adults in her life when the problems of the world get to be too much for her though in some cases the grownups are coping with more serious issues than she is. Yet Juno makes certain that it is she and she alone who will have the final say when it comes to determining the course of her own future and that of her child.Juno is that rare lowbudget independent feature that finds unexpected success in the mainstream by striking a chord of recognition in audiences across the demographic spectrum. Firsttime screenwriter Diablo Cody hits pay dirt with a cleareyed largely unsentimental script that is not afraid to go off in unexpected and interesting directions and that avoids patronizing its Middle American characters. Juno's father and stepmother manage to take the news in stride while the yuppie couple Juno alights on to be the child's adoptive parents are given a depth and complexity far beyond what a lesser writer might have afforded them. Director Jason Reitman keeps the quirkiness to a minimum and allows the scenes to play out in a naturalistic unhurried way. Confident in the strength and appeal of his material he lets the gentle human comedy speak for itself.In a starmaking turn young Ellen Page takes a daring approach to her character often bringing Juno right to the brink of unlikability then pulling back at just the crucial moment making us see how utterly likable she truly is. As the child's father Michael Cera is virtually the same lovably passive nerd we found so endearing in Superbad while J.K. Simmons and especially Allison Janney give rich shadings to Juno's supportive parents. Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner also make their mark as the couple who post their picture in the baby wanted section of the local throwaway.Juno faces the downside of any independent film that unexpectedly finds itself ripped from the confines of the art houses and suddenly duking it out at the multiplexes with all those highbudget highoctane testosteroneladen blockbusters  namely the risk of overinflated expectations. Thus my advice is to look beyond all the hype and box office records and simply let Juno sneak up on and take a hold of you in its own quiet inimitable fashion. I think it works best that way.".

My principal response to this version of a great and wellknown story is one of irritation. The overblown theatrical format of the film gets in the way of character and dramatic development to the point where you're aware of a director proclaiming aren't we clever with the way we're staging this? instead of admiring the straightforward and competent telling of a story. I'm not saying all films have to be constructed in a conventional manner but when the form overtakes the substance something has gone wrong.Aaron TaylorJohnson as Count Vronsky is a piece of serious miscasting. Instead of looking like a great lover and sure temptation for wavering Annahe looks like some feeble dandy with his foppish shock of dyed curly blonde hair which makes him look quite ridiculous. How on earth Anna could fall for such a creepylooking guy is beyond most viewers I would submit.Keira Knightley does the best she can despite looking most of the time like she's attending a fashion shoot. The character of Anna requires portrayal of a tragic life which she doesn't quite achieve. However the whole film fails to convey the grandeur of Tolstoy's vision so she's let off the hook by the film's general levity and lack of substance.".

	schema:headline " One Russian's take on the film";
	schema:reviewBody "So it is out  the film that so far has divided the opinions of the critics and audiences alike. A lot has been said about its theatrics and casting visual effects and costumes. The trailer alone made me go to see it the first day it was released in London. Despite the misgivings about the casting of the main characters I was hoping that the opulence of the setting decorations and costumes would be just enough to make it enjoyable and compensate for any acting mishaps. The film focuses is on the key relationships in the novel taking the bare carcass of the storyline. The result is a mechanical sequence of events devoid of any depth and humanity and almost clinically cold. Many nuances of the relationships are not explained at all and had I not read the book many times over these would have been lost on me. All of the sociopolitical and ideological issues affecting Russia in the late 19th century as well as the questions of humanity faith religion and the meaning of life are largely left out. Not only this accentuates the oddly flat quality of the scenario but also owing to the lack of context makes certain scenes e.g. Levin in the country look oddly standalone. As to the casting... Keira Knightley can be a delight to watch in the right context i.e. when she can get away with being herself on screen e.g. Bend it like Beckham and Love actually. However in the costumeperiod dramas she makes no allowances for the differences in social behaviours and mannerisms and ends up looking like a flirtatious modern girl at a fancy dress party. In the book Karenina's character is a sophisticated mature confident and sensuous woman of high society and rank but also a deeply kind humane and down to earth person. It is the latter qualities that endear her so much to the fellow book characters and readers alike from the beginning and help us feel the tragedy of her situation so keenly later. Knightley's Karenina is an alltooyoung flighty coquette with no obvious emotional maturity and little sense of decorum gradually developing hysteria which left me torn between incredulity and laughter. I wouldn't normally comment on the physical appearance which should be incidental to a true acting talent but modest chest and bony back sticking out of the impossibly lowcut dress for the 19th century add little to the believability of the character. Vronsky with those blue eyes blond locks stiff movements and bland facial expressions reminds more of a china doll than a dark handsome charming and intense character that Karenina falls for. Would she fall for this version of Vronsky? Doubt it and neither did I. As for the rest of the cast the only characters that look vaguely believable and that taken in the context of the rest of the cast are those of Kitty and Dolly. Ironically Kitty becomes more so towards the end of the film when Dolly loses it entirely owing to the dialogue with Karenina at the tea room.Lastly I would like to touch upon a few details of costumes and styling which I find worth of note. I wish the costume designer incorporated the Russian fashions of the 19th century more faithfully. The faons presented with the backs cut out almost to the waist did not become fashionable in fact socially acceptable until the 20th century. During the time portrayed in the filmnovel they would have been scandalous. Lavish jewellery was indeed in vogue although it is the understated elegance of choice so meticulously highlighted in the book that would have been true to Karenina's character. What Karenina wears in this film is unmistakably Chanel 21st century and bears no resemblance to the style or make of the time. I guess one comes to expect at least some product placements as part of the modern film industry and in the absence of carsphoneslaptops etc in this film one had to make the best out of what was available. Add to this aristocrats dressed like peasants Karening in the iceskating scene rich landowner styled like a monk Levin's hair throughout the film then same landowner donned in a top hat not worn by the people from his soslovie social stratum Betsy and her jaundice coloured dress Karenina at the theatre in what looks like a wedding dress and ermine stole Karenin wearing his wedding band on the left hand instead of the customary right in Russia Karenina wearing multiple rings Chanelstyle naturally on both hands  was someone confused as to the custom and decided to tick both boxes just in case??! Classical waltz transformed into anything but with peculiar hand movements that one critic described as beguiling but which looked suspiciously like mutual slapping of pesky insects and afforded a great deal more of physical intimacy in public than what was socially acceptable. Russian folk songs sang with strong foreign accent. At least no one in the film tried speaking with the Russian accent and for these small things Lord one should be grateful!Overall I wish I could call the film a drama or at least a parody on the 19th century Russian society but given its omissions and disregard of the cultural or social realities it is not. For all its pomp and pretentiousness the film fails to make a single character or scene fully believable forget about moving or meaningful and the final result appears to be nothing but a parody on the original effort. Some critics called this film as breathtaking. I agree it is breathtaking  breathtakingly awful that is.".

	schema:reviewBody "I adore the novel so I will be discussing Joe Wright's take on it and where it ranks amongst other adaptations but I will of course look at its merits as a film aside from the novel.As a whole adaptation this version falls somewhere in the middle. Even without all the metatheatrical trappings it still took an interesting and valid approach to the novel proving that the novel could be adapted until infinity and it would still be fresh each time. As readers of the novel would know there is much more to it than Anna's affair. Tolstoy did not write vague types he wrote fullyfleshed characters and Tom Stoppard's screenplay acknowledged Tolstoy's style. Therefore I don't want to condemn the film outright because that would overshadow the things that it does get right.Keira Knightley's version of Anna is not nearly as bad as you would think. She has the sense to restrain herself a little so that the many other elements of the novel shine through. She goes for the unsympathetic approach and it works. All her mannerisms that I generally find annoying the schoolgirl smirking and rampant nymphomania actually work for this role. This Anna takes Vronsky just because she can and then ultimately regrets it. We can feel her frustration she's young and wants to have fun but she's tied down to a stuffy older husband. In that sense it's quite a modern interpretation but not hideously so.Aaron TaylorJohnson as Count Vronsky was just miscast. If the novel had been about Anna seducing a schoolboy he would have been great but Vronsky is meant to be a dashing man. The styling is atrocious he looks like a seventies Scandinavian Eurovision entry. Wright seems to have told some of the actors to act realistic and some to play up to the stylised setting. TaylorJohnson plays the artifice so much that he just comes off as camp and sleazy. The scene where he is about to ride Frou Frou is like a production of Equus and there's a love scene with Keira Knightley that brought to mind an old advert for Philadelphia cheese. Their revelation of love is also poorly dealt with. Anna has some kind of fantasy dream where the two have an erotic ballet and suddenly they're banging away presumably now in the real world.Jude Law as Karenin. A bizarre choice when he could have played Vronsky five years ago and might even get away with it now at a push. However he gives a performance that is probably his best. His Karenin is a bureaucrat through and through. Other adaptations have still made Karenin an attractive option. This Karenin is certainly not going to develop any great passion soon. We also see how he is manipulated by moral guardian Countess Lydia. If Law is trying to make a reputation as a serious actor he's on the right path.And what about all that pretentious theatre stuff? It seriously slows down the pace in the first third but once you get used to it you can just enjoy the film. The ending is rather abrupt no that famous ending is not the last scene but quite poignant.".

	schema:headline " Tolstoi's Ana Karenina based on a digest for a middle school";
	schema:reviewBody "This new adaptation is nonsense. Tolstoy's novel is about a woman who belonged to the upper class that governed the Great Russia the country extending from Atlantic Ocean to Pacific Ocean from Arctics to Afghanistan. Why is that Vonsky's mother a princess by the title is sharing a bench with senator Karenin's wife in a second class car where her son price Vronsky finds them somewhere between third and the 4th raw? Their wealth allowed them to travel in a separate car and they often did! We were told from the screen that it was Russia of 1874. Well then how comes that Anna's son plays with train toys that run... on batteries? The cancan was normal for the workingclass ballrooms of Montparnasse but not for the aristocracy of Russian Empire exactly because it contradicted to aristocratic education and highly developed sense of taste. And amidst all of this nonsense we hear a bunch of subRussian ajlulu songs that would be appropriate for the poor villagers but not for the Russian Aristocracy of this time. The movie appears to be staged in the backstage of a Caf chantant. I was shocked to see that there is a hen sitting on the bookcase in Oblonsky's study. And why the Karenin's bedroom is situated in a huge hall with many columns in it? And his servants dressed as servants in bistro? Servants of aristocracy had to wear la livrea a livery a uniform! I have impression that ladies jewelries were rented from a local Macy's store while the entire picture was filmed in an abandoned provincial theater with broken walls and bad floor. And please notice that soup MarieLouise is always with asparagus so it is as inappropriate to mention this to the guests of Stiva Oblonsky's dinner. Extremely bad taste is obvious from about all scenes of the film. But so is the idea of this movie. We were offered just another attempt to present an adultre with a little bit attachment to un poux Russe. Unlike the world of commoners Anna was not granted the freedom of choice because her divorce and remarriage was to be approved by the Most Holly Sinod and the divorce lawyer who was omitted from the film was quite clear about this issue in his conversation with Karenin. This is why the drama had to be moved from the formal level to individual qualities of the people involved. And the only one who in my opinion reached this goal on behalf of Tolsoy was Jude Law who was excellent as new Karenin lacking the common impression of a ridiculed husband. I understand that the stamping clerks from Oblonsky's office was added to the whole venture by Mrs. Wright and Stoppard as a token of their appreciation of Russian Avantgarde theatre but it only enhanced the feeling of totally lost control over the flow of the drama. I am greatly disappointed. In my opinion this film lacks good taste understanding of Tolstoy's original idea understanding of the characters the time and circumstances of the drama which together constitute a minimum requirement for a fair cinematography for classics adaptation. Don't even think to offer this thing to Russian viewers because it will cause nothing but a belly laugh. Try to find and enjoy the Anna Karenina 1967 directed by great Aleksandr Zarkhi this is a true piece of art colorful and careful to every detail the highest expression of a family drama without exits that explains its tragic end.".

	onyx:emotionText "This new adaptation is nonsense. Tolstoy's novel is about a woman who belonged to the upper class that governed the Great Russia the country extending from Atlantic Ocean to Pacific Ocean from Arctics to Afghanistan. Why is that Vonsky's mother a princess by the title is sharing a bench with senator Karenin's wife in a second class car where her son price Vronsky finds them somewhere between third and the 4th raw? Their wealth allowed them to travel in a separate car and they often did! We were told from the screen that it was Russia of 1874. Well then how comes that Anna's son plays with train toys that run... on batteries? The cancan was normal for the workingclass ballrooms of Montparnasse but not for the aristocracy of Russian Empire exactly because it contradicted to aristocratic education and highly developed sense of taste. And amidst all of this nonsense we hear a bunch of subRussian ajlulu songs that would be appropriate for the poor villagers but not for the Russian Aristocracy of this time. The movie appears to be staged in the backstage of a Caf chantant. I was shocked to see that there is a hen sitting on the bookcase in Oblonsky's study. And why the Karenin's bedroom is situated in a huge hall with many columns in it? And his servants dressed as servants in bistro? Servants of aristocracy had to wear la livrea a livery a uniform!

	schema:reviewBody "Closed in and Claustrophobic I felt I could breathe only when the scenes escaped outside of the theater stage and onto the snow covered train depot or the green fields where Levin was sowing grass or where love was a lazyday picnic on the greenest of grasses but only briefly and only disappointingly after again finding myself cramped and stifled in a hot sweltering and old 19th century theater. The ball room scene was excruciating. The dances and dancers themselves reminded me of a mix of street dance country and western and some invented Tim Burtonesque Danse Macabre for the purposes of being unique strange and possibly histrionic. The moves were stiff and unflattering and I was embarrassed to watch Anna and Vronsky clumsily make there way through the physical distortions that made their clothes appear illfitting and as though they both had two left feet. I could not feel the same passionate love between Anna and Vronsky in this movie adaptation as I'd previously felt in reading the novel. The emphasis on cinematic style and surrealism kept interrupting my wish to relive and enjoy the story. Further contradictory to the memories of my mind's eye of the handsome and manly Vronsky in the novel I came to see him in the movie as bit effeminatelooking weak and depicted as a vulnerable little mommy's boy. I paid my ticket expectant and hopeful but at the end and as I exited the theater I found myself confused disappointed and rippedoff. Anna Karenina will always be one of the greatest experiences in literature I've had the pleasure of. But next time as surely there will be yet a next time I'll simply pass on the movie. I simply cannot bear the risk of seeing Vronsky look like that again.".

There are several shots where Keira is picture perfect but this role was not for her. This performance ruins our memory of her former success under Joe Wright. Especially her first which is her most unforgettable. Black Swan did the same for Natalie Portman another of our cinema sweethearts. Which I walked out of. Her part here needed to be much deeper and more complex but instead it was shallow and trite. The way Anna was portrayed was out of place. Whether by acting or writing I don't know. Either way it was a mistake. All of the male leads four at my count complemented each other perfectly and were well done. Some surprising cameos among the women. I didn't see it at the theater after hearing about the stage within the movie technique which has actually been done in a few good movies. I didn't see it as a problem. The recent film Anonymous about Shakespeare began this way as do others based on plays of his. Julie Taymore in her solo attempt to put Titus on film blended styles while injecting modern means and mechanism into near ancient settings and pulled it off very smartly. Both of these were good films and highly worth watching. I point this out as there were many complaints about it in other reviews. It isn't the blending of the modern and the ancient or the use of multiple styles in itself that is a problem. It's more a question of whether it works and how well it was done. I believe here it does. Peter Greenaway excels at this kind of film making. We sometimes forget how shallow we have become as a society. What a melange and patchwork our culture is. Are we surprised it shows up in our films. There are some moments of clarity in the movie that are almost bewitching. While others present motion picture as painting or poetry. Some very good transitions. Overall I believe it to be a very creative effort. It is a blending of choreography stage and cinema with a desire to please the eye and entertain our emotions. It was only the moral ambiguity and modern sensibilities between the two lovers I found contemptible. Both of them being out of time and out of place. Love is the great conquerer of lust. As lust is the great destroyer of love. I believe the author intended this to be about the second. It is a mistake to think movies from books should be the book. Just as it is wrong for an amoral people to replace the beliefs of a moral people . . with their own. Especially when borrowing or telling their stories. One of the great enjoyments for all lovers of period pieces is going back to a time when people knew morality and understood what it was and most agreed with it.

	schema:headline " Beautiful Enchanting and Bold";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Joe Wright's adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's 1877 novel Anna Karenina is one of the most visually stunning and artistically bold films I've seen in quite some time. Wright places most of his plot within the confines of a dilapidated theatre and has his actors make use of the stage stalls and behind the scenes areas when forming the sets of late Tsarist Saint Petersburg. Actors will walk from one part of the theatre to another with sets and costumes changing around them all with the hustle and bustle of both a real theatre and lively city. It's a stylistic decision which was probably met with scepticism by studio bosses and the like but works incredibly well to bring to life the characters which themselves are so wonderfully written by Tolstoy.Joe Wright was lucky in a way in that he started off with a fantastic story written by Tolstoy. This was then adapted by Oscar winning screenwriter Tom Stoppard who handed Wright and his cast a beautifully well crafted script which despite its complexities rolls of the tongues of the talented cast. I have never read the source novel and have in fact never managed to finish any of the great works of Russian literature the names don't help so the plot was new to me. The themes of love infidelity trust and city vs countrysidelife charge out of the screen and most are tackled very well. One area which I thought was slightly forgotten was the fascinating part of the plot regarding Levin Domhnall Gleeson. Levin is in love with an attractive and highly sought after young Princess Kitty Alicia Vikander. His tale of love family hardship and politics feels slightly brushed to one side which is a shame as his arc also points towards the social upheaval which would greet Russia in the coming decades.The first half of this film was probably my favourite half of any I've seen in the cinema this year. It whizzed along thanks to the dialogue plot and interesting design. The problems that I have with some period dramas such as dull ideas and duller characters felt a million miles away as I watched transfixed with a smile on my face. The highlight of the entire film for me was a ball in which some of the central characters danced. This was a scene full of careful manoeuvring examination and lust as the two lovers become intimate for the first time. Onlookers watch on as Anna and Count Vronsky dance a waltz to an ever quickening pace. Kitty watches with horror as she sees the man she thought was hers slip away. The dancing itself is beautifully choreographed and came as close to art as I've seen dance be. Due in part to the nature of the story the second half of the film doesn't quite live up to the pace or intensity of the opening half but is nonetheless interesting dark and impressive.There are three things which make Anna Karenina one of my favourite films of 2012 so far. The first is the story the second is the direction and the third is the acting. Every single member of the cast dazzles here with not one actor giving a misjudged or poor performance. The standout for me is Jude Law whose mild mannered and restrained performance is simply incredible. He maintains grace and dignity despite having a terrible spell thanks to Anna and Law manages to convey all of his emotions in a similar understated way to Gary Oldman did with Smiley in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. He also makes the audience feel incredibly empathetic towards his character. For an actress I'm not particularly fond of Keira Knightly has somehow found herself with two excellent central performances in two of my favourite films of the year this and A Dangerous Method. She feels like the gotogirl for this type of role and is excellent although my girlfriend rightly points out that when she smiles she looks like she's about to cry. Aaron TaylorJohnson also gives a good performance despite comedy moustache as the dashing lover. He is believable as the swarve and arrogant cavalryman but is outplayed by Law in later scenes. It's funny to think that ten years ago it would probably have been Jude Law in the Vronsky role but he has matured as an actor in recent years and can carry off a character like Karenin with aplomb. Another standout is Matthew Macfadyen who plays more of a comedy character but plays it gracefully. Domhnall Gleeson is also superb as Levin.Despite the great acting this is the director's film. The style is so bold that at first I was worried that it wouldn't work but to keep a city as vast as Saint Petersburg inside one theatre then having the rest of the world to play with outside the city was a fantastic idea which was pulled off with pinpoint precision. There are flaws for instance it felt slightly too long and some areas weren't given as much attention as I'd have liked two contradictory statements I know but overall Anna Karenina is a enchanting film and one of the best I've seen so far this year.www.attheback.blogspot.com".

For an actress I'm not particularly fond of Keira Knightly has somehow found herself with two excellent central performances in two of my favourite films of the year this and A Dangerous Method. She feels like the gotogirl for this type of role and is excellent although my girlfriend rightly points out that when she smiles she looks like she's about to cry. Aaron TaylorJohnson also gives a good performance despite comedy moustache as the dashing lover. He is believable as the swarve and arrogant cavalryman but is outplayed by Law in later scenes. It's funny to think that ten years ago it would probably have been Jude Law in the Vronsky role but he has matured as an actor in recent years and can carry off a character like Karenin with aplomb. Another standout is Matthew Macfadyen who plays more of a comedy character but plays it gracefully. Domhnall Gleeson is also superb as Levin.Despite the great acting this is the director's film. The style is so bold that at first I was worried that it wouldn't work but to keep a city as vast as Saint Petersburg inside one theatre then having the rest of the world to play with outside the city was a fantastic idea which was pulled off with pinpoint precision. There are flaws for instance it felt slightly too long and some areas weren't given as much attention as I'd have liked two contradictory statements I know but overall Anna Karenina is a enchanting film and one of the best I've seen so far this year.www.attheback.blogspot.com";

	schema:headline " Brilliant adaptation";
	schema:reviewBody "Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina is one of the most acclaimed novels of all time not least of all because of the excellence of the book's themes. These themes of Tolstoy's are expressed extremely well in Joe Wright's adaptation of Anna Karenina. First and foremost and the area that really sets the film apart is the theatricality of certain settings in the film. Many scenes take place on sets made to resemble the stage especially early on. I was initially baffled by this choice but I slowly came to realize that it functions as a way to make visual the artificiality of the world inhabited by Anna Karenina specifically its outdated values. It's extremely clear that Russia was undergoing a major transition during the time in which the narrative is set. Trains and railways play a major role in the film and of course trains are a common symbol of technological progress. There's more than passing reference to the freeing of the serfs and the radical ideology even of some aristocrats which echoes the life of Tolstoy himself. Much is also made of the cultural shifts in Moscow and St. Petersburg the former of which had apparently become rather oldfashioned compared to the relatively progressive Petersburg at the time. The film suggests that the reaction of the country's upper class was to ignore the major changes that were occurring and cling all the harder to the past especially with regards to social institutions. Thus the eponymous heroine finds it impossible to escape her loveless marriage with any social standing intact which eventually drives her mad. This isn't just a plainly literal translation of the source however as Wright's clever use of the stage is just one of many visual techniques he uses to make this material cinematic. Wright's use of landscape is unusually strong particularly in the surreal final shot. His use of mirrors made me think of some of the works of RW Fassbinder another supreme visual stylist. Another neat touch is having background characters freeze and fade into the background to suggest the heightened emotional state of the main characters particularly in the scene where Anna has her first dance with the rakish Vronsky. Overall another excellent movie from one of the most promising English language directors of his generation and the best 2012 film I've seen so far.".

During my long life I am 72 I have seen many performances on the stage and movies Anna Karenina. This film is the best. It has everything that should be in the movie fantasy entertainment teaching and of course the classic love story. For me personally it is not always important WHAT ABOUT it is also important to me HOW IT DONE. From my point of view movie is entertainment. Of course those critics who finds fault with hairstyles or jewelry they know better what they want from the movies. They always want to hear a Russian accent and see plausible buttons on the dress. But this is not a police report this is feature film. Visual aspects are amazingly talented. Acting work to the point of perfection. First time in my life I saw real Karenin not halfdead old man but a loving decent husband. Keira Knightley is impeccable as Anna. rowd scenes are tasteful. Music is touching and talented. Tolstoy's novel is very hard to adapt for a screen it even difficult to read and the director was able to convey the main thing in this beautiful and romantic movie. I agree with Berthold Brecht who said When you entertain teach and when you teach entertain. There is no doubt that this film is not for everyone and those who like Scream 2 or  Spiderman they do not have to watch this movie. All critical reviews are long and tedious but the film is short with exciting feelings and has a good taste. There is only one measure of art talented or not talented. The rest is a matter of taste. But there is no accounting for tastes.This film is talented in every way.".

At first I was a bit dumbfounded as he kept rolling walls switching scenery in the middle of a scene. It was a bit unsettling but then I thought it was a matter of style and because he does keep a decent amount of period set decoration and costume I got used to his approach.The story is predictable and the execution is the key here with some very good acting especially Law as the husband who must adapt to the impulsive ways of his wife a woman who is torn by the newly found lustlove she feels for her younger lover. Anna is a puzzling character because at first she seems to be a staunch defender of the establishment and by the end all signs of reason and sanity are gone. She has surrendered to pure emotional impulses and the end is nothing but tragic. The saddest part is how her actions are just replications of what her brother did previously but the consequences for her are much more severe and not even her own gender offers any sympathy. We have seen this before in The House of Mirth and other works of that era. This time the film gives a more dramatic mix throwing some innovative visuals a lush oldfashioned music score and great turns by Johnson and Knightley.Karenina has two stories going on and it might be a bit confusing to see their respective functions as the world of Anna is falling apart by her actions the world of this other couple survives the initial shock of what some might consider lust. Whatever it might be love can both a restoring and a destroying force and to a point honesty does play an important part in the mix.This society is interesting. Institutions are celebrated deviations are punished accordingly and sides are switched most conveniently. Everyone recognizes that you have to play by the rules and these can sometimes be flexible but compromises must be reached and Anna is not willing to listen. It gets so bad that her few supporters eventually must spell it out for her and there is no going back. Soon madness sets in to force her into a final solution.In the end the film is a new retelling of a centuryold problem you just have to make sure you play by the rules and you had better watch your step. Emotions have no place in a society that is inflexible and unforgiving.".

Worst casting in the history of film period!!!! Never have so many gorgeous actors been turned ugly! It is unwatchable it makes me sick. Levin is THE WORST casted actor I have ever seen and I am shocked and appalled and disgusted ! It is horrendous....It is offensive to the people who have actually read the book to the book itself the characters that made history and above all the genius himself Lav Nikolajevi Tolstoj. Music doesn't suit the film the actors don't suit the parts the idea itself is beyond horrific the setting the idea of the idea there are not enough bad words to describe this.... I've heard stories about this film and I didn't want to believe them because of my love and respect for Matthew Macfadyen Keira Knightley Jude Law and many others who worked on the film but sadly I was let down by these great people who disappointed me beyond words... This is a sad world we live in where anyone can make a film..... This kind of butchering should be considered a crime against ART!!".

Worst casting in the history of film period!!!! Never have so many gorgeous actors been turned ugly! It is unwatchable it makes me sick. Levin is THE WORST casted actor I have ever seen and I am shocked and appalled and disgusted ! It is horrendous....It is offensive to the people who have actually read the book to the book itself the characters that made history and above all the genius himself Lav Nikolajevi Tolstoj. Music doesn't suit the film the actors don't suit the parts the idea itself is beyond horrific the setting the idea of the idea there are not enough bad words to describe this.... I've heard stories about this film and I didn't want to believe them because of my love and respect for Matthew Macfadyen Keira Knightley Jude Law and many others who worked on the film but sadly I was let down by these great people who disappointed me beyond words... This is a sad world we live in where anyone can make a film..... This kind of butchering should be considered a crime against ART!!";

But the final result made me ask myself was this supposed to be a parody? Not one grain of the brilliants was transferred to the screen the casting was wrong especially for the two main characters. Keira Knightley is a wonderful creature but she definitely does not represent sophistication of Tolstoy's character and as for the role of Vronsky...once you see him appear you will know why I believed it was a parody. The sad conclusion to my review is that much has changed from Tolstoy's time and there are no more happy familiesbut event though we can't grasp the full concept of his Anna Karenina the directors should have made an effort to present it for what it really isa great human inner conflict and tragedy and not a mindless adventure of a silly school girllike character.".

The brief interludes of actual scenery were lovely but far too few and short. Some of the dialog was somewhat muffled resulting in misidentification of a few characters initially. I can't imagine whose idea this was but I'm not surprised to read of the fine actors who turned it down after reading the concept. The characters who elicited an emotional reaction from me were Kitty and Constantin those actors were so real that I was moved to tears by the depth of their facial expressions and vocalizations. I felt the nudity was totally unnecessary and the depiction of smoking just silly. I looked forward to this remake but was sorely disappointed and cannot in all good conscience recommend it to anyone.".

Tom Stoppard wrote the screenplay for this adaptation and the work was directed with eye toward timeless artistry by Joe Wright. There will be some detractors who feel that cinema is cinema and stage plays are stage plays but Wright's decision to combine the two works extraordinarily well. The flavor of Tolstoy's story and mood are maintained and yet made somehow more vital by Wright's electing to place this story as though it were happening on a theater stage including catwalks backstage audience and theater boxes etc. The story is theatrical and Wright embellishes the last of the Czarist days with great aplomb.The story needs no summary Anna Karenina Keira Knightley more beautiful to behold and brilliant in acting than ever is married to Alexei Karenin Jude Law in a tour de force acting role and is happy in her station with her slightly cool husband but very warm young son. Then quite unexpectedly her eyes meet those of the wealthy Count Vronsky Aaron Taylor Johnson in a career making turn and their love is immediate. The flirtation is enhanced by some of the most beautiful waltzing choreography on film. We are in St. Petersburg Russia and divorce is something only a man husband can initiate so as the love affair reaches a point of no return Anna must decide whether to bear the shame of a divorced woman or just be the mistress of the incredibly handsome Count and remain married. In contrast to the AnnaVronsky duet is the passion of the country lad Levin Domhnall Gleeson for the aristocratic Kitty Alicia Vikander and throughout the story the two forms of love are paralleled. Anna becomes pregnant with Vronsky's child an act that quietly infuriates Karenin as it makes Anna's affair public  a condition no one can tolerate in that society  and subsequently results in Anna's leaving her beloved son after she gives birth to the daughter belonging to Vronsky Karenin will care for the child. The climax comes with Anna's infamous suicide and the story ends with all loose ends tied.The exceptionally strong supporting cast includes such fine actors as Matthew Macfadyen Kelly Macdonald Olivia Williams Ruth Wilson Emily Watson Michelle Dockery and Shirley Henderson. The luxuriant costumes are by Jacqueline Durran the cinematography is by Seamus McGarvey and the glorious musical score is by Dario Marianelli. A Stunning Film. Grady Harp".

Visually they all are made in different style and form defined by  or sometimes defining the trends in the contemporary Georgian cinema. spoilers ahead !.The major achievement of Tengiz Abuladze himself is a trilogy The Plead Tree of Wishes and Repentance. These films got a wide critical acclaim and Repentance even became the major hit in USSR. Many Soviet and PostSoviet Critics and viewers consider it to be the best Soviet film of 80ies. The phrases and notions from this film became proverbs and are quoted everywhere general concepts Repentance and the Way to the Temple where overabused by soviet media for over a decade. But... some foreign critics were much less agitated by the film. Leonard Maltin even found it boring while in USSR the film was often criticized for being too entertaining !!!. On the contrary film by Nikita Mikhalkhov on a similar subject  Burnt by the Sun was very well received in the west while in former USSR it was simply excoriated by critics as a shallow Hollywoodoriented Soap and a definite cashin on the glory of Repentance.  Some foreign critics and viewers didn't understand anything about the Repentance which is full of symbols and allusions some of them are uniquely Georgian. apart from the Stalin criticism. Here are some facts about the film that foreigners mostly do not know.1. The story is a real one  Beria the darkest evil character of Stalin epoque crushed  a wellknown painter after he attempted to protect the Metechi Temple a trade mark of Tbilisicapital of Georgia that Beria planned to destroy to build some monument. As always everyone who opposed Beria were arrested and mostly executed. But the Temple symbol of spirituality human values heart of a nation survived.2. Due to this the prologue and epilogue of the film are very important  by the way there are 2 time periods in the film the Past  Stalin Time totalitarian regime the Present  Brejnev Period so called Zastoi standstill stagnation period  time of conformism when everything became seemingly all right so the prologue and epilogue is the picture of the soviet Zastoi of 70ies everything seems to be all right and a child of family destroyed by totalitarian regime makes cakes with beautiful but fake temples on them eventually the cake is eaten be a dirty little bearded man admiring the totalitarian past and speaking about Varlam Aravidze read Stalin Beria and all other  monsters from the Past with admiration and the cakemaker the victim of Varlam says nothing and just imagines what could she do to remind people of truth. But this is just her imagination people are conformists they need no truth and only old vagabond woman searches for the Way to the Tample.3. The Axis of the film is Aravidze family Aravidze in Georgian means Nobody's Son we see 3 generations Varlam  the totalitarian past his son Abel and His Wife the innocent conformist Present and Tornike the Grandson the future that finally must take the responsibility for the crimes of past4. But this  taking the responsibility for the crimes of past is a controversial issue that's why everything happens only in the imagination of the cakemaker becouse the degree and a form of repentance and the repentance itself is a very complex and painful matter and yes the Skeleton in the Closet affects and punishes not Varlam who commits the crime but Abel who tries to hush it up and Tornike who is among few really innocent characters of the film. Digging out the corpse of Varlam the Past  is this a solution? The authors leave the question to the viewers.5. Some scenes need explanationThe funeral may look grotesque but in fact its pretty realistic and is more a humoristic critique of Georgian obsession with ceremonies Georgian Cemeteries are really the monuments of human vanity  huge with excessive use of marble granites and other materials. Putting cage on the grave of Varlam is symbolic but in general the episode depicts how unholy the sacred places   have become in Soviet Union Georgia the episode with church shows the same  the church is transformed into Power Station. Episode in the greenhouse is a Naked Gunlike literal depiction of the expression Under the Capto have someone under control. During his Inauguration Speech Varlam makes  a statement that became quintessential when depicting Stalin regime. He cites Confucius  It's hard to catch cat in the dark room especially if it is not there and paraphrases it We Will Catch the Cat in the Dark Room Even if It's not There. For those who have little idea of Stalinism the accusation for making a tunnel from Bombay to London  may sound forced but in fact its very realistic and sounds rather tame next to some other accusations based on which millions of people were killed. Episode with Goddess of Justice has dual symbolism First the goddess has become a lady of dubious reputation playing piano with a stalinistic prosecutor second the actress making cameo appearance here appeared in the first part of  the trilogy as well the Plea there she was a symbol of beauty and purity.6. The cast is all star of Georgian cinema of course. Many viewers even didn't noticed that father and son Varlam and Abel are acted by the same actor !!! The old lady at the end of the film looking for a temple is last screen appearance of Veriko Anjaparidze perhaps the greatest Georgian actress. By the way her character is obvious older Pupala from the Tree of Wishes there this character was acted by S. Chiaureli daughter of Veriko.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie starts with a newspaper obituary recording the death of Varlam Aravidze the mayor of a town in Georgia. We're then shown what has happened in the town in the past when Varlam was mayor. He's nominally a communist type however it's made pretty clear that his stripes and the stripes of all Stalinists are feudal. This is shown for example by having the police of the town dressed as mediaeval knights. It's an idea explored in Iosseliani's Brigands too that Russian rulers have been a succession of crazed autocratic knaves. At one point in the film Varlam plaintively quotes from Shakespeare's sonnet 66 Tired with all these for restful death I cry As to behold desert a beggar born And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity And purest faith unhappily forsworn And gilded honour shamefully misplaced And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted And right perfection wrongfully disgraced And strength by limping sway disabled And art made tonguetied by authority And folly doctorlike controlling skill And simple truth miscall'd simplicity And captive good attending captain ill Tired with all these from these would I be gone Save that to die I leave my love alone. Which is a harangue against everything he stands for. He's a man who has knowingly chosen to do wrong a comedian who has turned his fiefdom into a comedy of terror. At one point he arranges for his son to jump out of a second story window to shock his captive audience but in fact the boy is caught below. He surrounds himself with illiterate sycophants whom he brings into and out of favour arbitrarily arranges for people to be arrested and benevolently releases them when complaints are made. In the end however he's merely a snake playing with its live food before devouring. Varlam arranges for people to be exiled presumably to Siberia although we're not told. One day a shipment of logs arrives on the outskirts of town. They have been logged by the kidnapped men of the town. Each survivor has carved their name into the end of the timber. Women from the town trudge around the muddy lumberyard looking for their husbands' names looking for proof of life for men denied the right of correspondence. This is the most powerful scene in my opinion. There are also a number of dream scenes and very surreal scenes that are very appealing in their artistry which I leave the reader to discover for themselves. Varlam is as has been pointed out a concoction of dictators superficially containing elements of Hitler Mussolini and Stalin but may well in more concrete terms be based on a real life figure Georgianborn Lavrentiy Beria a man more unpleasant than the imaginations of most can conjure up. He was Stalin's chief murderer a sexual sadist who performed unimaginable feats of depravity he also briefly participated in the running of Russia as part of a troika after Stalin's death. The film does not dwell on the huge depths of his depravities as the acts he performed are unspeakable and unfilmable. The film is a quiet but firm indictment however of Stalinist politics of the manipulation and doublethink and an ode to Georgian culture. The purpose of the film is to not let Beria or more generally the authoritarians of the time rest in peace to act as testament to the cruel depravities of the Stalinist era. In my opinion it's absolutely unmissable.".

This time Pokajanije was for me thrilling experience with breathtaking performance of Macharadze and Ninidze. Once again I watched it in TV few years later and I've found a little dated and emasculated in uncovering communist's crimes. But still it was great cinematic beautifully filmed experience. Now I've ordered DVD in dvdplanet it's still unavailable in Poland and I'm really curious for my nowadays impression.25 dec 2004Today I've watched the movie once again after the reading of Montefiore's book Stalin  the court of the Red Tsar. In this book I've found the story of Kawtaradze family. Sergo Kawtaradze old revolutionist and comrade of Stalin during the great purge in 1936 was arrested with his wife Sofia. Both were cruelly tortured in Lubianka. Daughter Maya 11 years old wrote many letters to Stalin begging for the parents' life. After 3 years of imprisonment Kawtaradzes were freed but still in danger of arresting again. Few weeks later suddenly at 6 AM Stalin  Beria came to Kawtaradzes. Stalin kindly spoke with daughter Maya. In her memories she wrote that he was charming and kind. He also sang a song with pleasant tenor. They also ate dinner Stalin ordered it in the best georgian restaurant in Moscow Aragwi. I'm sure that episode in the movie when Warlam and Doxopulo visits Sandro's home is loosely based on this event".

The cast is uniformly excellent the premise unique and much of the dialogue resonates with beauty despair and universal truth often mingled with humor.

Its originality outstanding aesthetics and compelling themes constitute a landmark in former USSR cinema as well as worldwide. It is a fascinating metaphor on power tyranny and ideology.

There are six sequences organised on four different levels.1. PRESENT. A woman Ketevan and a man learn the death of Varlam.2. IMAGINATION. We first think it is a continuation of present action. The true nature of this sequence will only be revealed at the end. Ketevan imagines she unearths Varlam's body and faces trial.3. PAST. Ketevan during the trial describes how her childhood and family were destroyed by Varlam. It is hence an imagined flashback since it is included in part 2.4. FANTASY. Four scenes are included in parts 3 and 5 Nino dreams she and Sandro try to escape Varlam Abel daydreams he talks to a devilish character who is actually Varlam Merab fantasises twice he sees Varlam is crazy Guliko dances near Varlam's body.5. IMAGINATION same level as 2. We come back to the trial.6. PRESENT same level as 1. We understand parts 2 to 5 were imagined by Ketevan.This Russian puppets structure generates a sensation of confinement on line with the environment the story is limited to a town without any news from outside time seems suspended although the action takes place over decades we are lost in a indefinite period between modernity and Middle Ages the horse carriage the medieval armours. The confinement materialises an allegory the focus is on symbols not proportions nor accuracy.Another trademark of the movie is its unique mix of reality and fantasy. For instance Abel daydreams he sees Varlam eating a fish when he comes to his hands actually grasp fish bones. When Merab imagines Varlam is crazy the scene seems real and is probably based on actual facts Varlam was somewhat lunatic a feature that might have worsened with age. Conversely many supposedly authentic scenes feel unreal. When Sandro comes back he meets a man in suit and a blindfolded woman Justice playing piano outside. When Nino and her young daughter Ketevan look for Sandro's name on logs the atmosphere is dreamlike or rather nightmarish outstanding images pace and music make this scene one of the most compelling of the movie and of cinema in general.The confusion between reality and fantasy even casts doubt on the movie's structure and credibility. Did Ketevan imagine all this or only partly? What is true or not? Metaphorically this incertitude illustrates the absurdity of tyranny everything is irrational. Power is unpredictable Varlam is grotesque but omnipotent he suddenly changes from sympathy to repression stupid accomplices become powerful. Nobody is safe rules are arbitrary people can be arrested or released randomly a centuriesold temple is destroyed for no reason opponents confess stupid acts digging a tunnel between London and Bombay and denounce everybody to weaken the system. Power transits from one generation to another unchanged the same actor plays Varlam and his son Abel until it destroys itself Merab unable to embrace the system or change it commits suicide Abel eventually unearths Varlam and throws him to the crows exactly as Ketevan said she wanted to.To carry on despotism will use reasons that look logical but are arbitrary scientific progress overriding everything else the experiments endangering the temple a minority presented as the people the letter denouncing Sandro external threats repeated a few times necessity of hardships that will bring better tomorrows on the glorious music of Ode to Joy senseless quotes celebrated as Gospel We will catch the black cat in the dark room even if there is no cat. The references to USSR regime are obvious. However Repentance also delivers a general message about dictatorship Varlam looks at the same time like Beria glasses Hitler moustache and Mussolini black shirt braces. Deep down all tyrannies rely on irrationality that pretends to be rational.On top of power Repentance is a reflection about ideology. Varlam is cultured he knows about painting and religious art he sings recites Shakespeare quotes Confucius. So is his son Abel who plays the piano. Yet knowledge is nothing and even dangerous if it is used for wrong reasons. Culture turns against itself Sandro's paintings are confiscated the artist Sandro is deported the temple is destroyed Varlam promotes precisely what Shakespeare's sonnet criticised. To save the world we do not need brains but a heart.A heart granted but how? Crushed by oppression people are powerless. Ketevan whose family was destroyed by Varlam now feeds a ridiculous little man who supports the dictator she can only imagine what she could do. Varlam's grandson commits suicide. Opponents collaborate andor are deported. People fantasise to escape reality.Nevertheless for a heart and to escape oppression one can turn to religion. As a reminder religion was heavily repressed in USSR. Allusions to this repression include the man at the beginning eats cakes shaped as churches Varlam in Abel's dream eats a fish reference to Christ ICTUS the temple crumbles and is finally destroyed. Yet as a sign of hope the movie closes on the wise words of an old lady What good is a road if it doesn't lead to a temple? Spirituality will carry on regardless.In the end what is the Repentance of the title? Merab's who realises how evil his grandfather was? Abel's who throws away Varlam's body? Ketevan's who regrets being unable to perform her imagined revenge? Others' lack of repentance? As the movie the title encloses different levels of interpretation and remains partly mysterious.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was masterfully orchestrated with its use of allusion and cinematically pleasing to the viewer. The story begins with a woman baking a cake while a man who sits and eats the cake brings up rather tearfully the recent death of an important local mayor. Varlam Aravidze the source of focus in the film is a recently deceased dictatorlike mayor that through his govern established the use of many Stalinistic ideals and utilized countless Machiavellian techniques to subdue the people of the town. The film then goes through a surreal like dream sequence in which the woman a former victim of this cruel regime baking the cakes thinks of these injustices and creates a world in which proper punishment the exhumation of his corpse is administered for the crimes he committed. Through this dream sequence the director skillfully oscillates between the past and the apparent dream present back to the real present. During which many allusions are made to the actual Stalin regime and the damages inflicted on the people of the time. Despite the time period being set during the stagnation era the after effects of the administration are still profound in this films portrayal of what ends up being a tragedy caused by the after effects of the administration. The quote the time we live in has Varlam arrested might have been a literal reference to this time period of stagnation in which Varlam's older Stalinistic practices were no longer widely condoned but as can be later be seen through of the film cannot be simply ignored. The movie was definitely much more entertainment based than others that might have come before it that might have only served ideological purposes. The movie was very insightful in Soviet customs which can be seen through the funeral scene that might seem odd but familiar in the ritual aspect to foreigners. The time skips and changes in dream planes added a level of ironic enough realism that made the social commentary on the consequences of ignoring the past even more palpable to a viewer. Overall the film was great and worth watching the full 150 minutes of it.".

Valam played by Avtandil Makharadze has a Hitler mustache but is clearly based on Lavrenti Beria who before being head of the Soviet security services was the top leader in Georgia and under whose rule the worst part of the great purges happened Beria was known for its particular cruelty. Keto's father was the painter Sandro Barateli played by Edisher Giorgiobani a redhead who looks like Vincent Van Gogh who was arrested by Valam after he tried to protest the destruction of an ancient church regarding the name it might be worth noting that one notable victim of Beria was the theater director Sandro Akhmeteli.This might be the most anticommunist film ever made in the Soviet Union though its aesthetics are very much in the Soviet tradition of the Brezhnev era. I might be wrong but I think this was the first time a Soviet film touched on the issue of the Stalinist repressions. In a touching moment Keto declares on the stand that such actions cannot be forgiven this was filmed during a period in history where the repressions were hardly mentioned at the official press. It's amazing this film was even made. It was released in 1987 to wide acclaim after being shelved for several years. The movie goes beyond criticizing the excesses of Stalinism but goes on to attack the heart of the Soviet system. On the minus side the movie is sometimes overwrought and has a lot of surreal bizarre touches that are not always successful. And at around two hours and a half the film is also too long with parts that are a bit of a struggle.".

	schema:reviewBody "Repentance is a film one would expect to come out of Perestroika and Glasnost. It is a Stalinistearly Soviet metaphor that would have never been seen before this time. The story begins in present day or in this case 1984. In a small Georgian town the mayor Varlam Aravidze dies. The seemingly important citizens of the community come to pay their condolences at his funeral. However one day after the funeral the corpse is found at the home of the mayor's son. The corpse is reburied . . . but is removed from the crypt a second and third time. A woman is taken into custody and put on trial. She admits to having done it much of this part of the film is full of flashbacks focusing on Varlam's terrible reign revealing her motives for having done it. Varlam looks like a combination of dictators. There are traces of Hitler the mustache and Mussolini the black shirt but of course he can also be compared to Stalin and Beria two of the cruelest names known in Soviet history both who were of Georgian origin. Varlam was the Stalinist figure and the two other generations of his family could be considered a lot of the rest of Soviet history. His grandson clearly represents the period of Glasnost and Perestroika. He has trouble accepting what his family has done and he commits suicide because of it I'm sure it was not meant to be this way but it could be considered a foreshadowing of the end of the Soviet Union. The son of Varlam is sort of everything in between Stalin and Perestroika except the antiStalin Krushchev years.This was a very interesting movie it was a little too full of symbolism but beautifully made. It was a very interesting change watching a Georgian Soviet film instead of a Russian made Soviet film.".

The story begins in present day or in this case 1984. In a small Georgian town the mayor Varlam Aravidze dies. The seemingly important citizens of the community come to pay their condolences at his funeral. However one day after the funeral the corpse is found at the home of the mayor's son. The corpse is reburied . . . but is removed from the crypt a second and third time. A woman is taken into custody and put on trial. She admits to having done it much of this part of the film is full of flashbacks focusing on Varlam's terrible reign revealing her motives for having done it. Varlam looks like a combination of dictators. There are traces of Hitler the mustache and Mussolini the black shirt but of course he can also be compared to Stalin and Beria two of the cruelest names known in Soviet history both who were of Georgian origin. Varlam was the Stalinist figure and the two other generations of his family could be considered a lot of the rest of Soviet history. His grandson clearly represents the period of Glasnost and Perestroika. He has trouble accepting what his family has done and he commits suicide because of it I'm sure it was not meant to be this way but it could be considered a foreshadowing of the end of the Soviet Union. The son of Varlam is sort of everything in between Stalin and Perestroika except the antiStalin Krushchev years.This was a very interesting movie it was a little too full of symbolism but beautifully made. It was a very interesting change watching a Georgian Soviet film instead of a Russian made Soviet film.";

However the government also was concerned that these complaints might lead to complaints about the current systemand this is probably why Repentance was banned for several years after it was filmed. It does attack the Stalinist era and mentalitybut apparently those in power at the time weren't willing to allow such a film to be released.Repentance is a very surreal sort of filmone which has many story elements that seem dreamy and unreal while the rest of it is quite literal. While there were purges seeing the 20th century purges carried out by knights in armor a living statue of Justice and many other story elements are dreamlike and strange. This is not really a complaintjust an observation. The film looks almost like Dal or Buuel added a few touches here and there...just a few.The story begins in the present day. The beloved mayor of a Georgian town Varlem has died and folks come to his funeral to pay their respects. However several times after the funeral the body of this man has been taken from the crypt and placed in his yard! After the third time they catch the woman responsible and she is taken into custody. At the hearing she openly admits having done it and tells a story of long agowhen Varlem first became mayor. At that time he made a name for himself persecuting the innocentand the story is about how this impacted the woman personally.Following her long tale the story goes to the present day. The hypocrisy and evil of Valem's friends are examined as wellincluding one case about a man who struggles between Atheism and Christianity. Under Christianity he SHOULD feel guiltand he ultimately gets to meet the Devil this is pretty weird...and clever. Other folks all begin to confront their own part in Varlem's reign of terror.Instead of this film directly attacking Stalinism it clearly attacks these tactics on a smaller scale. And I am sure it was not unintentional that Varlem looked much like a bloated Hitler! A very strange but daring film. While today it might be seen as very tame back in the mid1980s it must have caused the filmmakers a lot of problemsand potentially prison. Quite clever but quite slow and strange. Well worth seeingespecially if you lived through this era.".

	schema:reviewBody "A striking and politically astonishing for it's day act of selfexamination selfcriticism and ultimately selflaceration of a film made in the Soviet Union. This is a darkly funny playfully surrealistic scathing satire of the Stalinist era's turning the entire population of an empire into suspects to be jailed exiled and eliminated at whim. Full of striking images and strong performances. Told in flashback it starts from the death of a seemingly beloved small town mayor who we come to learn played the role of a local Stalin. Likable and even playful on the surface the more we see his ever growing darkness the more disturbing the film becomes as he ever more readily destroys those who might be enemies or are simply inconvenient. This flashback tale is framed by watching his family after his death trying to deal with their own feelings of and denials of guilt as a local woman her life ruined by the mayor stands trial for repeatedly digging up his corpse again and again. Far from a perfect film some of the surrealistic imagery works better than others and some twists seem a bit like 'easy' explanations of complex behavior but this is still a fascinating challenging and unique film about one of the great horrors of the last century. And an effective cautionary tale about the power of a paranoid state.".

An equally important one is Tengiz Abuladze's Repentance. This one emphasizes not only the terror visited upon the population but the efforts to expose the truth and prevent whitewashing of those who committed the genocide. The subject is a man who shares physical similarities with Hitler and Stalin but is based on Lavrentiy Beria one of Stalin's acolytes. As mayor of a town in the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic he doesn't hesitate to persecute those whom he deems disloyal. Years later a woman goes to unusual lengths to reveal the truth about his handiwork.Not surprisingly the movie couldn't get released immediately. It wasn't until after Gorbachev came to power that it got a release. I'd say that the ugly parts of history are more important to know about that the pleasant parts of history to ensure that they don't get repeated. I understand that Beria was particularly vicious.We don't get to see many movies from Georgia. I wish that I could see more of them. Part of it is that I like getting to see cultures that we don't often get to see but I would also like to have more insight into their perspective on things. As the 2008 war made clear RussoGeorgian tensions didn't end with the collapse of the Soviet Union.Anyway it's an outstanding movie. While it is a bit long the plot makes up for that.

Eulogies are mouthed by very important and least important denizens of how great an individual he was. But his corpse keeps surfacing in his house exhumed by unknown forces. Eventually a woman baker who bakes the best cakes in town with delicious church steeples as icing is found to be the one who keeps exhuming the body each time it is buried and reburied. Threefourths of the film revolves around on her motives for repeatedly exhuming the body. This is the section of the film that reevaluates the tyrannical life of the dead man. The dead man's son Abel is reluctant to admit his father's evil acts but the dead man's grandson is ashamed of his grandfather's acts. The baker who had exhumed the body was directly affected by Varlam's tyranny and says she will not let the dead man be buried and is ready to accept the consequences. Her strange actions and what motivates them are allegorical of what Georgians endured during Stalin's rule in Soviet Russia. The three generations of Varlam's family depict the changing values within Soviet Russia with winds of Perestroika and Glasnost blowing on the faces of the younger generations.Repentance is the last film of the Georgian filmmaker Tengiz Abuladze who died soon after the film was released. Repentance like Klimov's Agoniya represents the Soviet movies that were released within Russia as Gorbachev unveiled Perestroika and Glasnost allowing audiences to reflect on issues that they never dared to discuss in the open earlier.The lead evil character Varlam Aravidze translated as Varlam nobody a name chosen to escape the censors is an amalgam of Hitler moustache Mussolini black shirt Stalin haircut and Lavrenti Beria pincenez spectacles. It is a political parable on the evils of dictators when smalltown bureaucrats use cunning and deceit to crush cultural values of art and ethical values of religion law and marriage. Historically Stalin and Beria crushed the national spirit of Georgians targeting the intelligentsia and the Church. Abuladze was among the few that survived.Repentance is a critique of Soviet history and assumes greater importance because it was made by a Soviet director and released in Soviet Union. The finest sequences of the film that would not be lost on East European audiences in my opinion were of a mother and child search for names of loved ones etched on logs that have been recently brought from Siberia because political prisoners communicated with their families using this unusual method and the final sequence of an old woman searching for the church which has obviously been destroyed in the empty town a simple sequence that signifies hope for the future.Death and consequent burial often indicates forgiveness. Didn't Mark Antony imply this when he said the dead is oft interred with their bones over Caesar's corpse? Abuladze's heroine Ketavan keeps exhuming the dead and buried corpse to expose the misdeeds of a despotic Stalinist hero recalling Alea's bureaucrat in the annals of Cuban cinema while baking cakes with symbolic church steeples on the icing reference to the deep loss of theism and orthodox religion in Stalinist attempts to replace religion with science. Ketavan's father is an artist with features that resemble Western images of Christ. The evil figures relish hogging the church steeples on cake icing and cooked fish a typical Christian symbol.Abuladze's film approaches repentance by looking at evil squarely in the eye and not by sweeping it under the carpet. Interestingly this is the very approach that HansJurgen Syberberg took while analyzing the rise of Hitler in his superb yet controversial 10hour long documentary HitlerA film from Germany. Abuladze's cinema like most Soviet filmmakers Klimov Tarkovsky Kozintsev MikhalkovKonchalovsky Zvyagintsev etc. is built on values that Soviet citizens imbibed through the Russian Orthodox Church.In Repentance the new generation seems to accept the misdeeds of their tyrannical family members and seek repentance while the older generation prefers to go to jail by exhuming tyrannical heroes and exposing their misdeeds. Both types of repentance make the film an interesting tool to study history of Soviet Russia. What is remarkable is that just as a parallel to the contents of the film the directors and writers of Georgian cinema exhume the misdeeds of the past and the new generation of film studio authorities and censors repent somewhat by releasing these films in theaters in Soviet Russia including Georgia and other nearby countries.In Abuladze's film surrealistic and satirical dream images of men putting flowers in a grand piano combine with images of a blindfolded woman with scales symbolizing justice playing the piano before being led way by a man in black with white gloves. There is black comedy as tortured prisoners name names so that no one will be left without being a suspect and the jails will be full of suspects.Abuladze has much to convey and at times seems to go over the top in his efforts to poke fun at tyranny. This is perhaps why Abuladze loses out to the more subtle works of Paradjanov the most talented Georgian filmmaker Tarkovsky Kozintsev and Klimov while driving home a similar message to the viewers. The cinema of Abuladze is more direct while Tarkovsky and Kozintsev more circumspect and openended. But Abuladze's cinema is without doubt film making that will unsettle a viewer to think about life after the film ends. The question each viewer should ask is Where are the Varlams that we encounter in life and can we rest by burying them?".

The film was a blatant attack on two of Georgia's most famous historical villains  Stalin and Beria  and on dictatorship in general. Its moral force is indisputable.

Maybe it was better in the theater but I sincerely doubt it.Although this movie had promise it appears that the filmmakers did not have sufficient grasp of the mechanics of filmmaking to produce an acceptable result. The dialog is stodgy and excessively verbose and is not uniform. The acting is weak and the characters were not well cast especially the two lead roles of Esther and Xerxes. This is Esther remade as a harlequin romance except there is no chemistry between Tiffany Dupont who seems like an adolescent rather than a woman of presence and Luke Goss who seems especially unfit for the role of a Persian king. I could not believe in their romance. The score is nice but mixed too loudly and therefore is distracting. John Noble almost saved the film but was not given enough screen time. Although pretty Tiffany Dupont lacks the confidence to win a beauty contest.The pace of the scenes alternates from a spastic and confused flurry of flashbacks in the beginning to grandiose and overdone and pretentious pomp that was not true to history. There are many unresolved dramatic subplots that do not enhance the storyline. In fact the main casualty of all this excess is the plot which bears no resemblance to the biblical book of Esther. Frankly it was hard for me to determine what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish. Of what benefit was the portrayal of Haman as trying to choke Queen Esther when the bible tells the opposite story? I have not read the Tommy Tinney book but this movie gave me no desire to explore it further. The idea that Xerxes has to physically stop a sword from hitting Esther is preposterous in light of the biblical account. It could never have happened. As a bible scholar I do not appreciate the departures from the plot from the bible story. Even worse is the propagandistic implication that the Greeks and the Jews were aligned in their love of democracy which has nothing to do with the historical events. The dramatic scenes did not work and the narration was excessive and detracted from the opportunity to tell the story. Cutaways were often poorly done and did not match the geometry of the scene. In fact the picture has a remarkably flat or twodimensional appearance for a picture that was shot on location in India. I don't think there was any clear concept of the space that the filmmakers were trying to portray.Frankly I'm both disappointed and dismayed by the hype surrounding this movie that did not correspond with the truth about the movie. Are we American Christians so shallow that we desire neither a movie that is true to the bible nor true to history? It might have been excusable if the drama worked or if the cinematography was believable. But the cameo by Peter O'Toole seems to have been included only to enable the filmmakers to misrepresent the film by using his name in such a way as to imply that he had a lead role which left a bad taste in my mouth. As a high school or a college film school project this would have been OK but it did not measure up to the standards of Cecil B. DeMille despite the promotional statements to that effect. This film was a resounding disappointment.".

	schema:reviewBody "At first I thought it was going to be a disaster. I was not impressed with Tiffany Dupont early on. She was more of a 21st century character than a woman of 2500 years ago. She seemed silly and frivolous and her dialog was ludicrous  but only in the first 10 minutes or so. She definitely matured and grew gracefully into the role of Queen Esther as the movie progressed  and fortunately her dialog improved as well.I was very drawn into scenes that featured other actors from the beginning however. Each scene with Luke Goss was mesmerizing. He is a very charismatic actor and was perfectly cast as King Xerxes. I confess that I fell in love with this character and this actor. Another favorite was Tommy Tiny Lister who stole scene after scene. There were some very funny touching and powerful scenes built around this mighty actor. What a wonderful performance. My next personal favorite was James Callis. He probably turned in the most stunning performance of all and I truly think he deserves a best supporting Oscar for this captivating role. That won't happen of course. No way that secular Hollywood will endorse this movie or praise this movie in any way  even though it's deserved. So far at least 75 of the reviews that I've read from the professional critics dish this movie. I think their reviews are being filtered though their bias and intolerance.I'm a Christian and I'm not a supporter or fan of Gen8x or TBN  but they finally got a movie right. Really right. And I hope it's a huge success for them.I loved this movie. It has everything...a beautiful love story humor intrigue great acting noble characters dastardly villains. Plus the locale costumes and music are magnificent. I'll go see it again...and again. I'm also going to buy the DVD as soon as it's released. I'll be thinking about this movie for some time to come.

	onyx:emotionText "At first I thought it was going to be a disaster. I was not impressed with Tiffany Dupont early on. She was more of a 21st century character than a woman of 2500 years ago. She seemed silly and frivolous and her dialog was ludicrous  but only in the first 10 minutes or so. She definitely matured and grew gracefully into the role of Queen Esther as the movie progressed  and fortunately her dialog improved as well.I was very drawn into scenes that featured other actors from the beginning however. Each scene with Luke Goss was mesmerizing. He is a very charismatic actor and was perfectly cast as King Xerxes. I confess that I fell in love with this character and this actor. Another favorite was Tommy Tiny Lister who stole scene after scene. There were some very funny touching and powerful scenes built around this mighty actor. What a wonderful performance. My next personal favorite was James Callis. He probably turned in the most stunning performance of all and I truly think he deserves a best supporting Oscar for this captivating role. That won't happen of course. No way that secular Hollywood will endorse this movie or praise this movie in any way  even though it's deserved.

Jonothan RhysDavies is awesome as always and there was not nearly enough Peter O'Toole for this fan. John Noble did a great job and James Callis was terrific wicked and relentless. Despite this the movie had plot weaknesses was confusing pacing was too slow at times the language was often flowery and Luke Goss as Xerxes was just awful his king dithering and weak.

	schema:reviewBody "Spoiler warning I was rather disappointed in seeing the movie. A grand story was ripped to shreds to provide a vehicle for a theme that has been told a thousand times in a thousand mediocre movies. I had read a string of glowing reviews but now that only makes me question the motives or judgment of those reviewers.In sum given the place of this movie's making it becomes all too clear that this is a perhaps grand effort on the part of Bollywood India's movie industry name to make a film that might have some appeal outside of India. This is not to disrespect Bollywood. I have heard good things about their work ethic and success in India. But it is an industry devoted to and wholly reliant upon love stories with little or no significance. I admit my low level of information about Bollywood but seeing what has been done to this story and connecting it to the place of its making etc I can draw only one conclusion.The saddest part is that they took one of the best stories in the bible one where a strong woman character rises to save the entire Jewish race and they reduced it to a maudlin love story best left for harlequin romances. It is a somewhat short story in the bible so a film would have to add some elements but this effort goes to ridiculous lengths.A better telling would be to approach some of the epics of decades ago for example the Ten Commandments. There while many elements were added to make the epic length the main story remains the heroic effort of Moses to bring the Jews out of Egypt.The story is one of triumph of a people under domination. There is little about love in the story itself and I found the . The movie creates two love settings or rather some kind of love triangle that has no place in a telling of the story of Esther.There is no character Jesse in the bible story. Haddasah does not have a boyfriend or love interest and more importantly there is no plan for her to travel to Jerusalem. There is no expressed love between HaddasahEsther and the King. In the story the King chooses her for queen simply because she pleased him. What that means is undetermined.The rest of the story relates to how after a bit of low level intrigue Esther is put in a position to be able to save the Jews. Unfortunately again here the movie goes to great lengths to create a storyline to put Esther in that position but it relies on inserted and improbable events when the bible story provides enough without the help of any averageskilled movie script writers.That is the movie is permeated with talk of war with Greece no less and that Greece's hated democracy and its concept of all people being created equal is a reason for killing the Jews since they are Greece lovers. Holy Frijole how timely! Boy isn't it amazing how history repeats itself? The movie writers spend the entire movie alternating between invented love stories or invented references to war and hatred of foreigners. Not a bit of it is in the bible story. Bah I could go on but I am afraid I am going to simply sound redundant.The acting costumes and camera work are very good. Sorry they got such short shrift in my review but unfortunately the way the story was completely ruined in favor of some shortsighted effort to make pablum with broad appeal it was hard to give credit where it was due.".

If you know your bible you can really spot the differences. I thought Tiffany Dupont who played Esther was charming. Luke Goss who played Xerxes was a bit overblown. The guy James Callas who played Haman was way over the top. John RhysDavies is always a joy to watch and he doesn't disappoint as Mordecai.Even with that I would rather see a movie like this than 90 of the stuff put in theaters these days. Would recommend seeing the movie and then go home and read the real story!".

	schema:reviewBody "Please accept this letter as constructive criticism and not bashing. I am a dedicated viewer and lover of TBN CBN all it's programs and partners and most importantly the Lord! Though the publicity and PR were excellent I have to honestly say that I was highly disappointed with the movie One Night with the King. The start of the movie was very uninformative on the reason why King Xerses had Vashti dismissed as Queen. As a believer and for those who are not I think it key for the audience to understand how the people of that day and country lived and exactly why Vashti was being removed as Queen. This really in essence speared the way for Ester to become Queen. I also feel that the audience did not get a good sense of passion between Xerses and Ester. Though this move was rated for audiences of all ages I feel that could have done a better job of showing just how much Xerses loved Ester. He loved her so much that he would have done and did anything for her. I really did not feel the love. Also this really is not meant to be a put down but I don't think the physical features of the character playing Ester was right in this movie. The Bible story tells of a woman that is so beautiful. I recall reading that after the decision to depose Vashti as queen the council decided to have a beauty contest and invite all the most beautiful women from all 127 provinces so that the king could select the most beautiful woman to be the new queen. In the reading Ester was gorgeous in form and features. She was radiant glowing and glamorous. Again this is not meant to be a put down but the actress playing the role does not represent Ester physically. The movie also did not emphasize on the amount of preparation that was needed for these candidates to get ready for the king. In addition the part in the move where Ester was running in the rain to get to Xerses to confess her true nationality and to save her people built up the audience but then nothing happened. Ester just fell in Xerses' arms and that was it. This definitely needed more substance. The audience needed to see just how much King Xerses loved Ester. The Bible indicates that when Ester approached the King without an invitation he faced her with a sword in his hand. The king gestured for her to touch the tip of the golden sword. When she did this she knew that she was safe. In the movie the king did not ask Ester of her heart's desire. The Bible indicates that the king said Queen Ester. You look absolutely ravishing today. What would you want from me? I will give anything that you want up to half of the kingdom. The movie seems to show anger and uncertainly in the Kings eyes. I actually do not recall any part in the movie where King Xerses says What do you want Ester? I will give you up to half of the kingdom. This was crucial. I don't feel that the King's deep love for Ester was really portrayed during any part of this movie. Overall I felt lost during the movie. This was not only due to the fact that I know the story pursuant to the Bible. I felt lost through most of the move and found myself struggling to understand what was happening and what part of the story was being shown. If I feel this way as a believer I have to assume that the non believer may have even fallen asleep or given up on this movie. Again this is not mean to be bashing but I really want to give my honest and heartfelt opinion which I share with my Christian friends who have also seen the movie. I would be a hypocrite if I pretended to love it just because I am a Christian and only to show my support for the production team and Christina film. God Bless".

But these were tiny island reefs in a sea of stultifying mediocrity. I can't blame the actors  Omar Sharif and John RhysDavies are hardly Bmovie material  so it's rather clear that the fault lies with the director.Still the acting was... distracting at best. To hear Ms. Dupont slip into and out of a fake English accent over and over was funny at first. But the tortured dialog seemed like it was written by a ninthgrader who had just read Shakespeare for the first time and didn't quite get the idea.I commend the actors for putting their best into it. I blame the director for getting the worst out of it the word overdramatized was coined with him in mind I'm sure. I abjure the writer to find another profession.

	schema:reviewBody "Much has been made of this film's depiction of sex. Depending on who you ask the scenes in question are brutally honest or simply disgustingly pornographic. Both descriptions boil down to the same thing either way you get to see erections. And ejaculate. A shiver goes through the audience people shift in their seats  we are not used to seeing this in a nonpornographic movie and it kind of throws us offbalance for a moment. But then as it must the film goes on and we are left to wonder what it was actually about. The reason I dislike this film as I did both Kids and Bully two movies that appear tame by comparison is simply because once you take away the shocking aspects of it  the violence the noholdsbarred sex scenes  it really isn't about anything much. What Larry Clark is apparently trying to say here is the same thing he tried to say with his earlier films being a teenager stinks. Life sucks. It's the kind of wisdom that depressed adolescents spraypaint on walls. In the universe of Larry Clark there are only two kinds of people those who abuse and those who are abused and those two categories may and probably will shift in time. This film's defenders invariably use the same argument sooner or later This really happens. And it probably does but it always happens for a reason. In Kids and Bully there were no motivations given at all for the character's deplorable behaviour. Rather they were walking talking symptoms of an illdefined social illness and the movies were none too enlightening for it. Here Clark and his codirector Ed Lachmann make a selfconscious effort at motivating the characters by including their parents. They're the ones to blame apparently all of them negligent of their kids at best and downright sexually abusive at worst. Aah but you see they too are only looking for love and can't find it. They were neglected or abused by their parents as well and are now continuing the cycle. Deep isn't it? In stead of spray painting Life Sucks one could argue that Ken Park as a movie might add the phrase And it does for my parents as well. But there's no larger context given to any of this. We get to see the seediness of it plenty of it but there is no real insight offered into these characters. Why do these kids and their parents do what they do? The only answer the movie seems to be able to provide is because they don't get enough true love. Put this exact same message into any madeforTV melodrama and people will rightfully spit it out as unbelievably simplistic. We never really get to know any of these characters much less care about them because all of them are solely defined by the various ways in which their lives are messed up. We don't remember individuals we just refer to That kid who ate out his girlfriend's mother. That guy who masturbated while choking himself. That girl who was into bondage. In a sense it becomes a freak show. What they think indeed whether or not they think what they feel hope want... It all remains rather vague hinted at sometimes but never fully explored because the movie has ever more bizarre and exploitative sexual behaviour to get on with. Two kinds of people will go see this movie those who live in the same kind of circumstances and those who don't. Those who don't can go home with a more or less secure feeling because everything they saw had been marginalized put squarely within this box labelled The Lives And Times Of Freaky People We Don't Want Anything To Do With. And those who do... What will they take out of this? Nothing resembling even the slightest bit of hope since no possibility of salvation seems to exist  the kids of Ken Park appear destined to become just as abusive as their parents and the very last scene has two of them notquitesaying they'd prefer to have been aborted. I read one reviewer who was apparently trying to earn a spot on the video cover with the quote This is a voice that just wants to be heard. Is that too much to ask? No of course not but the voice doesn't have a lot to say I'm afraid.Movies like this which contain what might be described as extreme amounts of either sex or violence seem to have a builtin defence mechanism whereby if you didn't like it or object to it you are automatically labelled a prude who was enormously shocked by it and therefore stopped thinking. Or even worse a censurer who would take all art he doesn't like throw it on a big pile and burn it. I assure you I'm neither. In fact given the amount of discussion about this movie's sexual content I'd expected it to be even more explicit than it was. And I would never want to ban anything just because I didn't like it. But I also don't believe in that kneejerk reaction some people have of automatically praising everything that seems to shock others. This is the kind of film that tries to bully you into thinking it's actually about something. Five years from now after all the fuss has died down Ken Park will be remembered  if at all  as a storm in a teacup one of those movies that come along every so often that everyone has something to say about but when looked on soberly in retrospect really wasn't worth the hassle. Pretty much the same has happened for Kids after all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anyone who finds pornography disturbing will find Ken Park disturbing for both the wrong and the right reasons. Its not pornography but it will be confused with it easily since it contains many of the same powerful ingredients nudity and explicit sexual behavior. What separates it from pornography is that Ken Park's intent is not to arouse but to provoke an emotional response by placing these same powerful ingredients within a troublesome relational context. Unfortunately that's also the problem with Ken Park. An average viewer can't witness explicit sexual behavior and be unaffected by it. We are all sexual mostly and most of us respond to visual stimuli. Ken Park demands that the viewer suspend that response look beyond any arousal or outrage generated from the explicit sexuality and focus on the relationships in the film of which sex is merely the expression. This asks of the average cinema viewer much more sexual maturity than most films ever hope to ask. We may demand more pressure on the envelope as a viewing public but the cumulative effect of pushing the envelope is still in the realm of speculative sociolology. Also the extreme youthful appearance some of the characters in the film will cause some companies to avoid distribution risks. Free speech is one thing defending accusations of spreading pedophilia is quite another and few companies can afford that kind of publicity.Personally I think that the Clark and Lachman have made a great film its a moral and compassionate statement. The characters feel very real in their banality there is real pathos. In fact the bland dialogue and delivery explains why sex holds such a powerful lure for these kids. They have access to rare delight and comfort with sex and weirdly enough a sense of peace. It rings true. The tragedy plays out that they are all compromised by clueless or pathological parent figures and the sexuality reflects a history of thwarted attachment. The final scene with the three main characters together struck me as very bittersweet since it plays more as a fantasy than a likely scenario.Art enjoys such a complex troubled relationship with the American public. We are such a rapidly changing audience with a huge appetite for challenge yet we don't necessarily absorb the changes we witness. As an audience we expect far more cultural sophistication than our capacity for balanced interpretation. Ken Park is evidence of that.".

Critics seem to be bending over backwards in their defense of sexually explicit imagery okay there's a little bit of what could be considered hardcore footage here but nothing on the level of say BAISEMOI for instance once again trying to establish the thin line between art and pornography forgetting conveniently perhaps ? to really focus on the film instead. Could it be that Harmony Korine's razor sharp screenplay largely based on the personal experiences of some of director Larry Clark's friends and models actually hit too close to home for a lot of people to admit ?Though the sleepy suburb in this movie might qualify as quintessential Americana by definition of many I can assure you that the stuff that happens over there takes place all over the world. A lot of things both the adolescents and their parents go through were instantly recognizable to me personally and I'm a 35 going on 36 year old employee from that minuscule ant heap of a country called Belgium. How's that for universal appeal ? Too many adult viewers would still seem to prefer to deny the very possibility that their teenaged children harbor strong sexual desires let alone the likely consequence that they've already acted upon them ! It may strike some as slightly unsavory that now 59 year old Larry Clark addresses such issues especially given the level of unflinching honesty and carnal frankness demonstrated here as he did in both KIDS and BULLY previously but nearly no one else apparently dares to come anywhere near this topic as of yet. Much more than simply courting controversy Clark and cohelmer Lachman have crafted a beautiful funny touching heartbreaking and absolutely haunting those final frames with the titular Ken Park will be etched in my mind for life work of yes art.A lot of older viewers have remarked that the film is somehow unfairly slanted in favor of the young characters compelling actors the lot of them rendering the adults as grotesque caricatures. As far as I'm concerned only very inattentive viewers could ever come up with that assessment. Tate's grandparents may initially come across as whiny and pathetic yet there's a sweet little scene later on that shows their genuine affection for one another. It is both telling and sad that their grisly fate apparently elicits far less shocks from its audiences than those scant minutes of groin action. A world gone mad indeed.Claude's macho dad is another case in point. His ultimate transgression towards his son manages to be both disturbing and weirdly touching. Each adult character let's not forget Claude's mom engagingly portrayed by the underrated Amanda Plummer gets at least one scene where the admittedly stereotypical surface is scratched away and subtleties like a single wounded glance can turn the whole story on its head. I sincerely love this movie precisely for doing just that.".

	schema:headline " A strange movie and as said not for everyone";
	schema:reviewBody "It had been a few years since I saw KIDS but remembered it as a film that made an impression on me. When hiring Ken Park at the local video store I was not sure what to expect. After seeing the film I think the director has made a few very good scenes and a few not so good. The relation between Claude and his father was very realistic and spot on the way the father treated Claude pushing him downwards instead of helping him and motivating him was very much like the relation I had with my mothers' husband. Still where Claude's father crosses the line after a night out drinking in his car never happened to me. I ask myself if that is needed in the film as well. The behaviour of the father should be enough for Claude to leave but I guess that night is the famous drop that makes the glass run over.Peaches and her father is another relationship that is completely dysfunctional. Somehow I could guess though that the innocent girl bringing home a guy from bible studies was not as innocent as her father believed her to be. Which is demonstrated when her father comes home to find Peaches in bed while she is about to orally please her boyfriend. The boyfriend which she has tied to bed has no way to defend himself against the insanely religious father of Peaches and gets a nice beating. This was another predictable scene but it was still a bit nerve wrecking on Peaches behalf as we could see her father get closer and closer to opening the door to her room.Shawn who sleeps with his future mother in law Rhonda and is obsessed with finding out if he is more hung than his future father in law is another character in the film. To me it feels a bit overkill to include all the sexscenes with Shawn and Rhonda. Especially the scene where Rhonda comes out of the shower seems a bit too much. Not that the scene includes a lot of sex but the dialog could have been included earlier.Tate is serial killer material and I thought so in the beginning of the movie. His killer talents were revealed in the movie not very surprising.It all starts and end with the story of Ken Park. The story about Ken isn't actually needed in the film if you ask me. It would do just as well without. The characters very briefly mention him and he doesn't really add anything to the film. That we are watching dysfunctional families is beyond doubt and perhaps is it that Ken Park did not want to end up like his parents that drive him to it but I still think he could be left out.I understand it that we have an uncensored version in The Netherlands and that really makes me ask what people saw in the cinema. It must have been a very short movie then. Do I recommend this film? Yes I do because it shows how narrow minded and unsupportive parents can be towards their children. How little they understand and how quickly they forget that they have been young themselves. It makes you think.".

The actions and reactions they take seemed so hackneyed to me. Could it be that Larry Clark is developing a larry clarkness? a style? As one who is purported to be a breaker of styles and conventions this movie was shot pretty conventionally with lots of sex. I wasn't too impressed with this effort. Some shots as Larry Clark says are there for realistic purposes but I just found it to be sensationalistic and unnecessary.The cinematography was great that is probably due to the Ed Lachman. The blue and red tinge really added to their respective scenes. Probably use of tungsten for outdoors and daylight inside.Correct me if I'm wrong but I could swear Larry Clark is moving from realism to symbolism. In one scene he has the family gather together on the front steps. Your good Ole' American suburban family full of deceit and infidelity but putting up a great face none the less.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a film about relationships. My congratulations to the people responsible for making this film because I've never seen anything remotely like it. Not even Kids. Shocking gripping honest mature inyourface. Ken Park is the first film made that takes us into the world of American families to show us what really goes on. Life is not all sweet and charming even though we might wish it to be. Movies don't have to be sappy and happy. There don't have to be car chases and killings cops and goodguys and badguys. To those viewers raised on soap operas and Friends turn away because you won't find this film funny.A shocker for sure...banned in most countries tells you a lot about it. When I see that it makes me WANT to see it. The sex is totally credible. You don't have actors grabbing for sheets or towels to cover up their bodieshey just like real life!! The scenes are tense the technical side perfect. You are going to be exposed to some troubled people and they're not only kids. Adults are having a hell of a time getting through life too. Some want a lot more than the 2 point 3 kids and a white picketfence house in the 'burbs. They long for illicit sex. But look for more you'll find it in this film. These are characters disturbed by life and not able to function exactly like your friends and coworkers and neighbors. Lots of people stumble through life and don't have a clue how to behave how to be loving or tender. Relationships with some people are constant conflicts which they don't even understand themselves. This film shows us some. The sad part is most people don't even realize how screwed up their lives are.I'm not going to review the plot. You just have to see it yourself and form your own views. Because films have to be seenthat's the art form. I'd also like to congratulate and thank everyone involved in this production for having the courage to give us something worthwhile. In the 1930's there was a film movement called surrealism which was designed to shock people. It did but today we don't get much shock value out of those old films. Ken Park isn't surreal but it really does shock...maybe it's hyperrealism. So real you feel totally nervous never knowing what you are going to see next. All the greenscreen and digital video effects dished out by Hollywood can't compare to the plain good unselfconscious acting and direction. Every character gets my Oscar and the direction and camerawork are so incredible they defy description. Whoever wrote the script knows how to write. Kids aren't as verbal as a lot of movies make them out to be. That lack of dialogue is what always distinguishes a great film for me. I'm not a big fan of voice over to make plot points but this film is so outstanding in so many ways the short bits of narration do not diminish it. Great work all around but if you grew up on Disney forget it.".

Certainly no one's adolescent years include all of the experiences presented but each represents the desires impulses and inescapable influences that dominate the teenage psyche. the movie is graphic because the lives of these kinds of teenagers are graphic. That Park skips from story to story without clear conclusions to each can be frustrating but it is deliberate. the conclusions of each tableau are irrelevant. the purpose of this piece is to provide an honest account of a culture that has henceforth been inadequately and unfairly presented. and Clark is more than successful in achieving this goal.Some spoilers follow Contrary to other posts about this movie it does not employ gratuitous shock tactics to prove some illegitimate point. certainly it is shocking but this is not the result of any tactic other than thorough research and unabashed honesty. Apparently this may shock some of you but these characters are not mere fiction and their stories are not fantasy. i can personally attest to the accuracy of this movie in its aim for an honest illustration of modern teenage life. the characters in this movie represent a relatively unique though certainly not irrelevantly obscure culture among teenagers. this movie is full of sex because these kids' lives or thoughts are dominated by sex. the graphic sex scenes are not just shock tactics they are crucial to the story. stop focusing on the nudity and focus on the acting. each of these graphically sexual scenes illustrates the flurry of emotions pressures and insecurities that torture these kids. Evry character in every scene save perhaps that in which Tate kills his grandparents is analogous to the experiences of almost everyone i knew when i was 1317 yrs. old. sex then was awkward and full of insecurity. resentment of one's parents or guardians was universal as was nearsighted desire for immediate gratification through sex and drugs. Equally universal were the random if superficial moments of clarity and understanding and thus despair regarding one's situation. parents who were junkies overlyreligious unfaithful whitetrash or simply nonexistent were not rare.Whether you wish to accept it or not this movie captures the essence of teenage life in the 90s and today even if drastically. one must applaud Clark's honesty knowing that it would be at the expense popular support and financial gain. It is sad that so few among the relevant agegroup are suited to watch this movie while so many need it to help them understand their own plight.".

He's usually good at juggling multiple story lines that end up converging in a natural sense but I felt that in Ken Park he didn't have a enough time to delve into any single character's storyline deep enough for the audience to become engaged with the characters which to me is a crucial element in any good drama.When the 1h10 mark came around I was more alarmed by the fact that there were only 20 more minutes in which to resolve the story than by the incest and murder taking place on screen.This failure was akin to Lukas Moodysson's A Hole in My Heart.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS BELOW ALONG WITH POTENTIALLY OFFENSIVE DETAILS READ AT YOUR OWN RISKIn the near twentynine years that I've been around I've seen a lot in film. I can freely say that it takes a lot for a movie to shock me. After watching Ken Park last night I have to add it to the list of films that have left me with my jaw on the floor. This movie doesn't push the envelope it douses it in gasoline lights it up flings it out the window then empties an arsenal's worth of bullets into it and mixes the ashes in with a diseased pitbull's food. I was able to watch this movie last night at a friend's house. I don't know what you the person reading this has heard or read about this film but chances are that whatever you've heard is indeed true. I've seen all of Larry Clark's films with the exception of Teenage Caveman. They're all pretty shocking in their own way. I remember walking out of the theater after watching Bully feeling as if someone wailed me across the head with a rotten plank. This film on the other hand is like a solid punch to the gut. If you've seen Kids or Bully you know what to expect in that Larry Clark is going to take things a step further. To make a long story short you see things in this movie that you would never think they'd have the audacity to show. The story itself revolves around a skateboarder named Ken Park who commits suicide at the end of the opening credits. Actually the film doesn't focus on him but on four kids whose lives are loosely connected to his. Each of these kids has an individual storyline to follow. None of them are pretty. The sex in this film is pretty graphic. There's no actual penetration per se but you do get to see various sexual acts in detail some of them carried out fully. Thanks to this movie I now have the image of some kid masturbating while choking himself with a robe sash tied to a doorknob. And not only do you get to see this in disturbing detail you get to see the inevitable conclusion of such an act. This scene alone is cause to question whether or not this movie should be labeled as pornography. The scene itself is like a train wreck that you can't take your eyes away from. I don't get my kicks off of watching stuff like this and I don't particular enjoy it. It's just one of those things that keep you watching because it's so grotesque. There are other scenes similar to this in the movie that will cause the same kind of response. You get to see these kids I say kids because that's what they are not one of them looks a day over twentyone and the majority of them look frighteningly underage doing pretty much everything you wouldn't want to think your own kids are doing which I guess is the whole point to this. I'm pretty sure that this was Larry Clark's intent and he succeeds to an extent. There's a slight problem I have with this showmanship which I'll discuss later. I think he manages to show convincingly that depravity lurks beneath what we consider to be the simplest wholesome things. Things like religion and our idea of the perfect family. There's a scene of a family having dinner with their daughter's boyfriend that left me feeling like I had things crawling all over me because of what was shown earlier in the movie between the boyfriend and his girlfriend's mother. I'll leave you to see the details of that one for yourself but I'll say that it contains footage that left me with my eyes wide open in disbelief. Watching the dinner scene is almost like looking at a delicious looking pie fresh out of the oven that you know is bubbling inside with rot and decay. If you see the movie you'll get what I'm trying to tell you.  It's sad to see the things you see in this movie because like it or not there is just no denying that these things and worse exist. There are places in our country let alone the world where these things happen with disturbing regularity. I commend Larry Clark for being brave enough to use the film medium to display what a lot of people refuse to accept. The one problem I had with this movie is that I think Larry Clark did go a bit overboard. I'm sorry to say it but I really believe that he did. The man has always been the guy who wants to push your buttons. I'm cool with that. I consider myself a liberal and I'm always up for a little envelope pushing. I believe that he has a natural desire to show us that things are not well with the youth of today and I believe that his intentions are well meant. While watching this movie I couldn't help but feel that it might have crossed the line and fallen into smut territory. There's a shot in Bully where Bijou Phillips climbs into a car and you get this long lingering view of her crotch which truth be told was completely unnecessary. That's the same feeling I got with this movie in certain areas. Do we really need to see this kid whack off and blow his load on screen? Do we need to see a close up of this kid's finger massaging a girl's vagina? Do we need to see the main female in this movie lick another character's penis? Do we need to see any of this and in such detail? To what purpose is this being shown to us? Is all of this absolutely necessary?Like I said I think Larry Clark means well. He directs with a sure hand and he gets convincing performances from his actors. It's people like him who show us that things aren't all rosy underneath sort of like a rough and rugged Michael Moore. I really hope that he's not filming these scenes to satisfy some sick vices. A lot of people perceive him to be nothing more than a dirty old man who enjoys seeing young kids do things they shouldn't be and then filming it. I'm going to give him a little more credit than that but this movie makes you wonder even if just a little what this guy's intentions actually are. I'd really like to see what he does in his next movie because I think it's going to be tough to top what's shown here and be able to justify it as being less than borderline pornography or even fullon pornography because Ken Park toes that line. Finally while we may not all agree on what constitutes art all art deserves to be seen no matter the content. I'd hate to think that I still live in a world where an artist's rights to freedom of expression gets thrown by the wayside by a bunch of people who presume to think that they know what's good for us the viewing public.

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS BELOW ALONG WITH POTENTIALLY OFFENSIVE DETAILS READ AT YOUR OWN RISKIn the near twentynine years that I've been around I've seen a lot in film. I can freely say that it takes a lot for a movie to shock me. After watching Ken Park last night I have to add it to the list of films that have left me with my jaw on the floor. This movie doesn't push the envelope it douses it in gasoline lights it up flings it out the window then empties an arsenal's worth of bullets into it and mixes the ashes in with a diseased pitbull's food. I was able to watch this movie last night at a friend's house. I don't know what you the person reading this has heard or read about this film but chances are that whatever you've heard is indeed true. I've seen all of Larry Clark's films with the exception of Teenage Caveman. They're all pretty shocking in their own way. I remember walking out of the theater after watching Bully feeling as if someone wailed me across the head with a rotten plank. This film on the other hand is like a solid punch to the gut. If you've seen Kids or Bully you know what to expect in that Larry Clark is going to take things a step further. To make a long story short you see things in this movie that you would never think they'd have the audacity to show. The story itself revolves around a skateboarder named Ken Park who commits suicide at the end of the opening credits.

But really haven't we all seen it before in a softer and much better way precisely on Larry Clark's Kids? I can acknowledge that there was an effort of putting morality together in this one but really what comes out even for an attentive spectator is that this movie ends up pushing the limits too much and becomes boring at it. The result is another shock movie another art house hardcore piece that to me didn't stick too much. Clearly more gratuitous than mindbending. Give us a story instead.";

	schema:headline " A visual feast but yet I wasn't gripped by the story or characters as much as I should have been";
	schema:reviewBody "When I heard that there was to be a film version of The Hobbit I was quite looking forward to it as the big finish of Lord of the Rings was still in my mind and unlike LotR I had actually read The Hobbit several times many years ago. When I heard that it might be two films I wasn't surprised but the news that it was to be three did rather dampen my spirits as I don't know if I had the interest for this story to be concluded as 2016 rolls into town. Regardless I did of course watch the film because it is still a large blockbuster and at a time of the year normally filled with overly earnest Oscar contenders I did quite like the idea of returning to this world again.With this in mind I did wonder why I watched it with a surprisingly detached air and why I wasn't able to get into it like I should have done. I had some reservations with the first film in the LotR trilogy but this seemed different because it certainly wasn't a lack of action and forward motion that gave me a problem here. Quite the opposite actually because once the first 45 minutes or so are out of the way then the action setpieces come thick and fast and noisy. The opening hints at the power of the dragon to come before settling down for a gentle reintroduction to the Shire and then the characters we will follow this section I found a little longer than it should have been and I could have done with a bit less noisy banter from the Dwarfs since the film would provide much more from them. The majority of the film is the journey or at least that bit of it that this film covers and it produces plenty of action with great special effects really well integrated into the live action. So visually and technically there is plenty here. Problem is that little of it felt urgent or tense and actually the delivery of the constant action does rather detract from it.With Fellowship of the Ring the group was smaller and the development of the plot better additionally the action was more scaled down and comparatively simple. Here we have setpieces where it feels like everything has been thrown at the screen and every inch of every frame has been filled with movement wherever possible. This tended to overwhelm me rather than draw me in though and in effect the noise prevented me really getting into it. Likewise by the time I had seen the characters survive impossible situations and defy gravity for the third or fourth time the film sort of lost the ability to make me believe there was danger involved  which is a problem given I was already being pushed away by how busy and noisy it all was. Tellingly the scene that worked the best for me was with Gollum this scene had tension had uncertainity had threat and did it all with small movements and dialogue also worth noting that while Gollum is of course another special effect you don't notice it in that scene because you are focused on the content instead of the visual.The cast sort of fit into this approach as well. While everyone is fine and does as required at times they do tend to become part of the noise and effects rather than being characters. Freeman is a good Bilbo and his mannerisms work well which helps negate his limited range while of course McKellen is always welcome. The dwarfs didn't make much of an impression on me though even if they all looked the part and delivered a few laughs. The rest of the cast are all fine but to be honest the effects are the main stars here and technically it is very impressive even if it is a bit overdone at times.I didn't dislike The Hobbit but at the same time I was disappointed in it. The action is noisy and busy but there isn't enough to draw me into the story or to make the action thrill me so much as it did overwhelm me. Hopefully the second film will see the characters and plots grow me on so that I am more emotionally bought into the films but for this first one I must confess to being surprised by how much the film seemed content to have me watch from a distance rather than draw me in and engage me.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was convinced the many criticisms I read beforehand were exaggerated and wouldn't bother me. To my surprise quite some criticisms seemed justified in the end ...THE SCRIPTADDITIONS On paper the additions looked like a great way to create added value. However while I understand why they included them they all feel out of place.Opening scene Ian Holm just looks too dissimilar from his appearance in FOTR especially his haircut which is really distracting. The frame story doesn't blend in naturally and the history of Erebor has too much to show in too little time.Radagast He appears as suddenly as he disappears. His scene in Dol Guldur really threw me out of the movie.The White Council I know the screenwriters want to underline the growing dark powers hence the  preposterous  finding of the Morgul blade but the empty talk about things of which we all know how they've played out in the LOTR films isn't convincing at all.Azog An appallingly onedimensional character who feels most out of place the fact that he looks like a creature from a cheap horror movie also doesn't help .... His scenes have a strange unTolkien vibe particularly the battle of Azanulbizar the worst scene of the movie which doesn't feel like a fierce and thrilling battle at all.FROM THE BOOK The episodic structure prevents the film from having a fluid narrative and squeezes the tension out of every new dangerous situation the events just leave you cold.In the book we experience everything through Bilbo's eyes which creates a strong connection between the reader and the main part. This is missing from the movie Bilbo even seemed to have more or less disappeared between the troll encounter and the stone giants' battle. His homesickness his doubts all of this isn't really developed in the script.The emphasis on Thorin is a good thing but also not perfect during the enclosure by the Wargs I didn't buy Thorin's charge towards Azog and especially Bilbo's sudden action hero saves the day in the nick of time intervention. The latter seemed like a very inappropriate way to illustrate Bilbo's courage.There were actually only two great scenes Riddles in the Dark is amazing but ironically it also painfully shows how mediocre the rest of the movie actually is because this is the only moment that comes close to the level of LOTR. Also Bilbo's speech after they've escaped Goblin Town is a very welcome for rare touching moment.THE PACINGIt's quite astonishing some people complain about the pacing because the film was over before I knew it. In fact I think the pacing is about just right and proved it would have been really difficult to adapt the book in just one fullyfledged movie. But since I didn't like the additions I'm doubting whether a third film is necessary after all but I suspend my judgment until 2014.THE CINEMATOGRAPHYOne of the biggest unpleasant surprises is the cinematographic style. I'm not talking about the bright colors or the digital images but the lack of physical camera use. Whereas LOTR has stunning real camera movements and an extremely accomplished handicraft feel AUJ often feels like a video game. The camera is flying and whirling so limitlessly that it just doesn't feel like an authentic movie anymore. This is particularly apparent during the Orc chase and above all the absurd Goblin Town escape. The CGI is perfect but too much is just too much.THE MUSICAfter my long list of complaints I'm truly relieved to say there is at least one thing that unconditionally gets my support which is the score. The people who unfairly label Howard Shore's work as a rehash of LOTR obviously didn't pay full attention because when you listen to the score multiple times and I admit it also took me several spins to really appreciate it you discover a new rich and diverse musical tapestry once again masterfully woven by Shore. OF COURSE you hear the same themes when EXACTLY THE SAME places are visited as in The Fellowship of the Ring ... If someone deserves credit for The Hobbit it's Shore his music is in my view the only aspect of the movie on par with the level of LOTR.3D  48 FPSThe 3D was good no complaints about that. However although I have no problems with watching movies in 3D I start questioning its necessity.I am bewildered many people claim that 48 fps creates a TVlook with actors with clear makeup on a fake set. I didn't have that feeling at all but on the other hand  and this was the most surprising  the difference with 24 fps isn't THAT spectacular. After 30 minutes I even had to remind myself Oh I'm watching 48 fps right?. Yes the images look very clear and it does smooth fast movements but the latter which is positive only sticks out a couple of times and no the motion never comes across as sped up so I was never distracted by the higher frame rate. All in all I consider 48 fps to be an improvement over 24 fps without diminishing the cinematic look of a film but I didn't have the feeling I had witnessed a revolutionary new cinema experience. CONCLUSION I didn't expect or want a replica of LOTR but while The Hobbit isn't a bad movie it isn't good either. I'm still perplexed I don't feel any urge to go see it again unlike the LOTR films. We can only hope that Jackson recovers in time to save the next two films from unnecessary additions lack of focus on Bilbo and a video game feeling. Well at least we have new brilliant music to listen to!".

	schema:headline " Yeahhhh! Graphics! Action scenes! AWESOOOME!";
	schema:reviewBody "Let's kick off with the score I've given it. 510. That's for the reasonable job with the comedy design and things not related to story and pacing with the exception of Gollum and the cave scene. I am tired of saying The graphics are great but... I have rated it 1 here to reduce the average in order to reflect reality and not the fanboy lovein.I am not going to sugarcoat this film or give it a good review just because people tell me I should. I am sick to death of sheep. I don't care if this is Tolkien or Jackson or how much money it took to make the film. If it's bad it's bad.Graphics count for nothing. The reason I watch a film is primarily for a great story and well written characters I have to CARE about what is going on. I don't get dazzled by graphics anymore if I ever did at all and 3D action films do not make a film good. So right there is the problem with The Hobbit. The story is shallow and pretentious and cardboard. Let's run through why the film had me rolling my eyes throughoutThe introduction is way too long.The pacing is dire and scenes that weren't in the book have been added.One brainless action scene after another for no other reason than to eat screen time because the book is 300 pages and they are trying to maximise profits by having 3 films at 3 hours each. Watching 2 rock monsters fight for minutes is not captivating or cool it's boring.Implausibility factor 10. I understand this is a fantasy. I understand that if everything was ultra realistic it would end up boring but for heaven sake that does not mean you can get away with what happens in this film. EVERY single scene shows something that would ordinarily kill someone. Fall down multiple ravines battle 100's goblins with just a few men rocks the size of cars flying at you... and no scratches no deaths. It just doesn't work.Lazy writing. You know you are witnessing a lazyass story when your heroes are saved at the last minute EVERY time in multiple scenes. Where does that leave us? It leaves us with all main characters intact and no dramatic tension. Every scene you see a massive rock crush a character you know they aren't dead. Every time you see them perilously close to the edge of a cliff you know that even if they fall they will be saved andor survive. Further to this point smaller problems exist such as Bilbo never handling a sword to suddenly taking on killer beasts like he has been to HeMan training school.Clich crap. The way Bilbo goes from being an outcast to being accepted is contrived and rushed and totally obvious. It just smacks of lazy clich writing. The acting that goes with it is not good either. Kind of like I once said... you weren't one of us... OH how wrong I was! Roll eyes time. Then you have the White Orc that Thorin said he had slain and you just KNEW it was coming back at the end for some sort of showdown didn't you? Talk about obvious. I blame the film for this because the scenes involved in the exposition were way too seethrough... might as well have had Thorin wink at the camera! That brings me onto the whole Thorin dislikes Elves angle where you know the Elves are suddenly going to become important allies just so we can have a totally obvious and expected reversal. Wow Thorin you got Bilbo wrong and you got the Elves wrong too! DRAMA.Lack of character development Think Final Fantasy XII if you are a gamer. This was the stake through the heart of this film... Most of the dwarfs are completely redundant and I could not identify or even accept Bilbo. This was due partly to the lack of character development partly to the script and partly to the actor. Same goes for Thorin except the scenes he is in feel more like a bad soap opera than they do a blockbuster film.It is just dull and lifeless and stupid. You shouldn't do things just because you can. The LOTR trilogy for the most part had decent pacing and it didn't do things too fast too soon or for the sake of it. The original trilogy suffers from some the complaints above AT TIMES but nothing like The Hobbit does... The Hobbit is in a league of its own. I went to watch an engaging movie and I got a cartoon.The use of CGI is also glaringly obvious and fake like with the prequels of Star Wars when the movie cuts between humans and CGI blobs your brain is onto it. Stop relying on CGI for everything. It's getting annoying not to mention OLD. At least Jackson makes real sets so it isn't a total wash out.There is some real potential in this film and it is squandered whether that's because Tolkien wrote a flawed book whether it is because he wrote a book that doesn't take well to a feature length movie or whether it is because Jackson messed it up that's what we ended up with.The Hobbit should have been 2 films and making it 3 has been the final nail in the coffin.So I am sat here mightily annoyed that once again graphics and self indulgent completely pointless action scenes have trumped good storytelling and pacing.Of course the film is still entertaining at times and the 3D visuals are fun but for me it is a massive disappointment.Visuals can not MAKE a film but when used like in The Hobbit they sure as hell can break it.".

Let's run through why the film had me rolling my eyes throughoutThe introduction is way too long.The pacing is dire and scenes that weren't in the book have been added.One brainless action scene after another for no other reason than to eat screen time because the book is 300 pages and they are trying to maximise profits by having 3 films at 3 hours each. Watching 2 rock monsters fight for minutes is not captivating or cool it's boring.Implausibility factor 10. I understand this is a fantasy. I understand that if everything was ultra realistic it would end up boring but for heaven sake that does not mean you can get away with what happens in this film. EVERY single scene shows something that would ordinarily kill someone. Fall down multiple ravines battle 100's goblins with just a few men rocks the size of cars flying at you... and no scratches no deaths. It just doesn't work.Lazy writing. You know you are witnessing a lazyass story when your heroes are saved at the last minute EVERY time in multiple scenes. Where does that leave us? It leaves us with all main characters intact and no dramatic tension. Every scene you see a massive rock crush a character you know they aren't dead. Every time you see them perilously close to the edge of a cliff you know that even if they fall they will be saved andor survive. Further to this point smaller problems exist such as Bilbo never handling a sword to suddenly taking on killer beasts like he has been to HeMan training school.Clich crap. The way Bilbo goes from being an outcast to being accepted is contrived and rushed and totally obvious. It just smacks of lazy clich writing. The acting that goes with it is not good either. Kind of like I once said... you weren't one of us... OH how wrong I was! Roll eyes time. Then you have the White Orc that Thorin said he had slain and you just KNEW it was coming back at the end for some sort of showdown didn't you? Talk about obvious. I blame the film for this because the scenes involved in the exposition were way too seethrough... might as well have had Thorin wink at the camera! That brings me onto the whole Thorin dislikes Elves angle where you know the Elves are suddenly going to become important allies just so we can have a totally obvious and expected reversal. Wow Thorin you got Bilbo wrong and you got the Elves wrong too! DRAMA.Lack of character development Think Final Fantasy XII if you are a gamer. This was the stake through the heart of this film... Most of the dwarfs are completely redundant and I could not identify or even accept Bilbo. This was due partly to the lack of character development partly to the script and partly to the actor. Same goes for Thorin except the scenes he is in feel more like a bad soap opera than they do a blockbuster film.It is just dull and lifeless and stupid. You shouldn't do things just because you can. The LOTR trilogy for the most part had decent pacing and it didn't do things too fast too soon or for the sake of it. The original trilogy suffers from some the complaints above AT TIMES but nothing like The Hobbit does... The Hobbit is in a league of its own. I went to watch an engaging movie and I got a cartoon.The use of CGI is also glaringly obvious and fake like with the prequels of Star Wars when the movie cuts between humans and CGI blobs your brain is onto it. Stop relying on CGI for everything. It's getting annoying not to mention OLD. At least Jackson makes real sets so it isn't a total wash out.There is some real potential in this film and it is squandered whether that's because Tolkien wrote a flawed book whether it is because he wrote a book that doesn't take well to a feature length movie or whether it is because Jackson messed it up that's what we ended up with.The Hobbit should have been 2 films and making it 3 has been the final nail in the coffin.So I am sat here mightily annoyed that once again graphics and self indulgent completely pointless action scenes have trumped good storytelling and pacing.Of course the film is still entertaining at times and the 3D visuals are fun but for me it is a massive disappointment.Visuals can not MAKE a film but when used like in The Hobbit they sure as hell can break it.";

But my Dad loved Glenn Yarbrough and the music so I was made to sit through it.Since that time I eventually appreciated the storyline of that silly cartoon and the characters from it. And when I grew up I read the book and then the LOTR series and fell in love with them.I think that you have to look at this movie from 2 points of view. From 1. Viewers like myself who fell in love with the books and original characters and are looking for some semblance of that universe in a movie. 2. Viewers like my kids who have never read the books and are fascinated by animated computer novels games and the unrealistic expectations of immortality in virtual super humans.If you are type 1. You will hate this movie. It fell short of all of my expectations. The Hobbit is not an epic story. In other words this story was short a 300 page book. It was however an epic adventure seen through the eyes of a single character a character who had a realistic perspective of his small contribution to the world around him. His character never wavered from that perspective as he watched events unfold and did what little he could to contribute and help. He never became the grandiose cocky tempered tough guy that this movie seems to try to portray him as.The Hobbit was a story that sets up the universe that these characters lived in. Elves Goblins Orcs Hobbits and Humans and other creatures defined their roles in this world and their conflicts. Then the story moves on to show how a band of characters plus the Hobbit interacts in this world and the story unfolds giving a lesson and a way to perceive our own world and how we as individuals interact with it. It's a simple message yet the book finds a way to make this message profound giving the characters depth and meaning and focusing on the hobbit as one individual insignificant in his eyes in an amazing world. This most basic message which encompasses the entirety of the book is completely 100 lost in the movie. The one line in the movie by Gandalf which was never spoken in the book but was the most significant and meaningful in this movie was All good stories need to be embellished a little... That was an understatement.If you are type 2 you might enjoy this movie. Tons of action crazy cgi most of the film is animated and it attempts to tie into and be a prequel for the LOTR trilogy. Lot's of battles and fighting immortal death defying falls just like any computer game that serves no purpose to define our mortality since no one dies or even gets injured last second cliff hanger rescues gross ugly characters that sound goofy and look like Jar Jar Binks on steroids pretty scenery loud noises explosions more bad guys killed per second that you can shake a stick at and pretty much any other Hollywood formula that draws in money. And that was just one movie in a trilogy that has no purpose other than to make lots and lots of money.I took the Kids to watch this and spared no expense. IMax screen popcorn Icees candy and some snacks. 100 down the toilet. The kids fell asleep during the first hour and I wanted to leave after the 2nd.".

It wasn't always easy to see the difference between certain dwarfs and the Great Goblin. In the book dwarfs are polite but dry and greedy. In the book  kindhearted heroic men a bit stubborn and loving to troll people now and then. Bilbo's not a conservative gentleman hobbit who gets carried away by his curiosity for adventure but a timid teenager. Gandalf isn't a powerful mage but a wellinformed homeless guy Radagast is another one and a schizophrenic in addition. Might as well fit in in Terry Gilliam's The Fisher King awesome movie btw. Actually there was no Bilbo character at all there was a combined character of Frodo Sam Mery Pin from LOTR.Verdict  if you want Tolkien read the book. The movie isn't worth watching even once.".

	schema:reviewBody "All great stories deserve a little embellishment. So says Gandalf the Grey Ian McKellen in the most telling line in The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey Peter Jackson's return to the world of JRR Tolkien. It's a line that clearly outlines Jackson and his cowriters' intentions yet it comes off as a veiled apology as if the filmmaking team knew that what they have created is going to be problematic for diehard Middle Earth fans. Sadly Jackson's new film doesn't come close to silencing the skeptics like his Lord of the Rings films did and is actually more illconceived than expected.Things that do work well for the most part in The Hobbit are sequences that come directly from the source novel. Iconic scenes such as the arrival of the dwarfs at Bag End or the encounter with the trolls are handled pretty well despite being padded out to unnecessary lengths with lame gags and pointless alteration of the original events in the book. Juggling such a massive primary cast is obviously a challenge and as such the film's best moments involve only one or two characters with Bilbo's Martin Freeman meeting of Gollum Andy Serkis and the finding of the ring being a particular standout sequence the only one that seemed like it could have used more time.However all of the good work that Jackson  Co do with the direct source material is swamped by the content they felt they had to develop themselves. The great achievement of the LOTR films is how they managed to distill the huge source novels to their most important story beats only hinting at most of the wider story in a way that brought incredible richness to the world in which they take place. With The Hobbit though Jackson only has a 300 page novel to start with and the decision to make three lengthy films I assume to parallel the first trilogy is precisely why this first film doesn't work.The Hobbit should be allowed to stand alone as its own film but it is structured in such a way almost identically to the first LOTR entry The Fellowship of the Ring that it's all but impossible not to compare them. As a sideeffect the much lighter tone will be jarring for a lot of established franchise fans the very people the film seems to be primarily aimed at. The chase sequence in the goblin tunnels for example is little more than an updated version of the Moria scenes from LOTR. It's exciting enough but much of the action feels in service of the film making technology on display rather than the story and as such none of the stakes of the earlier films are built here.Where the LOTR films had to keep moving at such a pace to fit everything in The Hobbit dwells on unnecessary moments which had only the briefest of mentions in the novel to reach its 2 hour 49 minute runtime. Most damaging are the call backs linking the previous trilogy setting up what is likely to be an almost completely new story bridge between the two trilogies in the third film due in 2014. There is absolutely no reason for Frodo Elijah Wood Saruman Christopher Lee and Galadriel Cate Blanchett to appear in this story yet here they are taking us away from a perfectly good narrative about a quest to fight a dragon. It reeks of cynical franchise care and arguably disrespectful to the carefully crafted world that Tolkien created.There's a good movie somewhere in The Hobbit and had Jackson shown more restraint we might have seen it. The film could easily lose at least 45 minutes but it feels as if director feels so beholden to his previous work that he needs to deliver an epic on the scale of LOTR. But that's not what this book is and we're left with an uneasy balance  the lighter tone to distinguish this as a separate story but a strict adherence to the LOTR structure  but ultimately doesn't fulfill either side.tinribs27.wordpress.com".

	schema:reviewBody "First came the original trilogy a popular success and critically acclaimed. Then some years later a second trilogy began a prequel to the original and the first installment of this second trilogy turned out to be awful. We saw this pattern play out once with Star Wars and now alas it begins again with The Hobbit a movie that is exactly one Jar Jar Binks away from being as bad as The Phantom Menace. The problem may be built into the design. The previous Lord of the Rings films were each based on a single book. The Hobbit  more like a children's novel than the other three a kind of Tom Sawyer to their Huckleberry Finn  is just one book smaller than any of the other J.R.R. Tolkien books and yet it is being blown out into three enormous films. This first installment runs 169 minutes.This puts a lot of pressure on a simple story especially when you consider that director Peter Jackson and his screenwriters really can't take liberties with the tale not without incurring the wrath of millions. They must work with what they have and what they have is quite enough for one pleasing and inventive twohour movie  or a ninehour disaster stretched over three years.This pressure this obligation to stretch everything to the limits of endurance and beyond is felt from the film's early minutes. Howard Shore's beautiful theme music from the previous trilogy filters in. We see the idyllic Middleearth countryside and are introduced to Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins  Freeman was born to be a hobbit he is ideal casting  and we settle in for a magical experience. And then slowly a fatal distance opens up between what we're hoping and what we're actually seeing.Bilbo is a happy hobbit a homebody who enjoys his creature comforts and doesn't have a violent impulse about him. Yet he is recruited by Gandalf the Grey Wizard Ian McKellen to join an expedition by dwarfs to retake their homeland from a dragon. See how quickly it takes to say that? Bilbo is recruited. Period. Yet the movie takes this tiny bit of crucial plot movement and dilutes its effectiveness The dwarfs show up for an impromptu party at Bilbo's house. Bilbo frets about what the dwarfs will do to his house. Then the dwarfs clean up. Then Bilbo says he won't join their fight. But then he does. The film milks every detail of the text every hint of vacillation in the main character to turn water flowing downstream into molasses walking uphill.It must be said that if you plan to enjoy The Hobbit it really helps to love dwarfs. Others may prefer hobbits  they're adorably idiosyncratic small chubby eat all day have big ears and they're incredibly sincere. Still others may prefer the Olympian elves  beautiful pristine sure and eternal. But there is only one hobbit in the entire movie and only one brief sequence involving elves. Otherwise you're stuck with the dwarfs who are like Vikings  boorish slovenly hearty and heavydrinking  and not exactly lovable.The three Lord of the Rings were heavy on battle scenes but The Hobbit is almost nothing but battles. Without a stopwatch it would be hard to know for sure but probably 50 percent of screen time is taken up with fighting  perhaps up to 80 percent if you count planning for and recovering from battles. Some of these battles have pockets of interest A conflict with goblins plays out like a trapeze act in three dimensions with the combatants falling through space landing and regrouping. But most of The Hobbit is like looking over Peter Jackson's shoulder to watch a computer screen.Occasionally when the smoke clears we get a glimpse of what The Hobbit might have been had Freeman's quirkiness and humanity been given a chance to set the tone. The movie really springs to life only when Freeman dominates as when Bilbo falls into a cave and discovers Gollum looking like James Carville but acting like Peter Lorre. It's an encounter worthy of the Lord of the Rings trilogy  so is the alltoobrief scene between Gandalf and Galadriel Cate Blanchett.If you loved the earlier films these are moments you will hold on to but they're very few and they're not enough.".

Others may prefer hobbits  they're adorably idiosyncratic small chubby eat all day have big ears and they're incredibly sincere. Still others may prefer the Olympian elves  beautiful pristine sure and eternal. But there is only one hobbit in the entire movie and only one brief sequence involving elves. Otherwise you're stuck with the dwarfs who are like Vikings  boorish slovenly hearty and heavydrinking  and not exactly lovable.The three Lord of the Rings were heavy on battle scenes but The Hobbit is almost nothing but battles. Without a stopwatch it would be hard to know for sure but probably 50 percent of screen time is taken up with fighting  perhaps up to 80 percent if you count planning for and recovering from battles. Some of these battles have pockets of interest A conflict with goblins plays out like a trapeze act in three dimensions with the combatants falling through space landing and regrouping. But most of The Hobbit is like looking over Peter Jackson's shoulder to watch a computer screen.Occasionally when the smoke clears we get a glimpse of what The Hobbit might have been had Freeman's quirkiness and humanity been given a chance to set the tone. The movie really springs to life only when Freeman dominates as when Bilbo falls into a cave and discovers Gollum looking like James Carville but acting like Peter Lorre. It's an encounter worthy of the Lord of the Rings trilogy  so is the alltoobrief scene between Gandalf and Galadriel Cate Blanchett.If you loved the earlier films these are moments you will hold on to but they're very few and they're not enough.";

	schema:headline " A deliberately inflated work of fanfare with eyes drawn acutely towards the box office";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the first of three films Peter Jackson has made to adapt J.R.R. Tolkien's prequel to Lord of the Rings. An elderly Bilbo Baggins writes to Frodo about the land of Erebor where the Dwarf King Thror lost his land and prosperity to the dragon Smaug. Bilbo then recalls the earlier years of his life played by Martin Freeman where he's timid and lost his sense of adventure. Bilbo's complacency is questioned by the wizard Gandalf Ian McKellen who secretly arranges for a meeting to be held in the hobbit's house. One evening Bilbo is interrupted by thirteen dwarfs who invite themselves inside. He's told these dwarfs are in search of a home but need a burglar who can accompany them to the mountain where Smaug is and take back their land and treasure. Initially reluctant Bilbo trails after the unit but this does little to impress Thorin Richard Armitage the dwarf leader and grandson of Thror who doubts the hobbit's commitment. Even without reading the novel The Hobbit nothing erases the feeling while watching An Unexpected Journey that this is a deliberately inflated work of fanfare with eyes drawn acutely towards the box office. Good cinema is defined by economics and how efficiently a story can be told with images. Peter Jackson demonstrated this skill with his Rings trilogy gracefully balancing multiple narrative threads and characters and ensuring each one possessed an appropriate amount of emotional weight.Why then has he chosen to make a soulless linear action movie extravagantly scaled but so insubstantial that it never justifies itself as the start of a trilogy? Penned by no less than four writers including Jackson this would have been more satisfying as one film with richer themes and selective action. Instead a novel of barely 300 pages long is extended to nearly three hours if only to showcase boring battle scenes and superfluous new technology falsely touted as innovative. The excess of Jackson's passion stems from his fascination with geek culture. Since the inception of his career in the 1980s making low budget horror films he has been concerned with subjects like the undead and the uncanny. His recent films have been criticised for being overly dependent on special effects. The trajectory of his career from horror to global blockbusters is not unlike James Cameron who is coincidentally using Jackson's special effects studio Weta Digital to work on Avatar 2. Both men have become transfixed by spectacle with each of their films more elaborate and technically sophisticated than the last. They seem intent on blurring the lines between video games and cinema which means more investment into technology and effects rather than the scripts. Someone distanced from the source material and video game culture might have made The Hobbit less selfindulgent and plodding. A legal battle between Jackson and New Line Cinema meant Guillermo Del Toro was originally meant to direct the film but was eventually replaced. As it stands Jackson's love for video games is all too visible here. The script is short on themes characterisation and subplots. It's overly rigid structure means the film becomes too absorbed in its sets and its environments instead of the story. Each scene is like a level from a game designed to showcase a gallery of monsters which are cogs in the film's tired formula for suspense. Exposition is followed by danger and then an escape route. Press start to begin. If the desire for a home offers some resemblance of a motive it's regularly lost in the flurry of the action most of which is extremely unengaging and lacking in tension. The film's one good scene admittedly adds some suspense and intrigue. It involves the reappearance of the monster Gollum and begins tying threads back to the Rings trilogy. The detail in Gollum's expressions beautifully captured again by Andy Serkis is even more incredible than before.How do scenes like this as overlong as they are fare through the introduction of 48 frames per second? The standard frame rate for films has been to use 24 frames per second. The additional number of frames on the screen adds more detail and colour to the images. The tradeoff is that it gives the illusion the images are moving much faster which is very distracting. It's an unnecessary addition so if you must see the film watch it in 2D. Will fans enjoy the movie? Undoubtedly but for most hardcore fans more is always more. Consider the families who will now be paying for three movies instead of one as well as the 3D surcharge and must then wait another two years to finish the story. They're shown a footnote of a narrative here and that's not right.".

We were expecting a lighter movie. What we got was a mess.Jackson has made major changes to the book. That in itself isn't a bad The LOTR book had weaknesses that Jackson's screenplay fixed but the Hobbit was already a good film size book that didn't need changes. Jackson's rewrites aimed at stretching a short book into three overly long films ruined a good story.An example is the addition of the White Orc whose gang chase the dwarfs everywhere. This boring 1dimensional villain gives an excuse for additional fight scenes but these are emotionally unengaging. You never feel that anything is at stake.Some have said Jackson had to stick to the source material. The thing is he didn't. Everything has been rewritten into a fight scene. We have the absurdity at Trollshaws that the dwarfs attack the trolls but then we wouldn't have Gandalf's iconic line Dawn take you all and be stone to you! So the dwarfs put down their weapons and crawl into sacks to be eaten. LOLWOT? Gandalf's voice throwing is cut from the film replaced with some unfunny dialog about worms. It doesn't add anything. It's not funny. It's change purely for the sake of change.It's not like Jackson lightened it up to make it more appealing to kids There is a lot of violence e.g. Gandalf stabs the goblin king in the eye then slashes his belly open. Jackson just doesn't show any blood. No blood  kids movie. Got it?Jackson added other tieins to the LOTR to try and pad the story out but like the unnecessary cameos they will only make you groan. Jackson now even suggests Gandalf orchestrated the dwarf journey as a deliberate precursor to LOTR as if he had an instinct that Bilbo would find the ring. It really makes no sense.Dol Guldur was a wonderfully creepy place in the LOTR books although it never appeared in the Hobbit. Jackson has Radaghast a supposedly powerful wizard show up flee in a panic after he sees a ghost. A ghost that can't even swing a sword. It just doesn't make sense. And then there is Radaghast's rabbit sled. Again not in the book. It's not funny. It's just stupid.Much like George Lucas' flying R2D2 Jackson has changed characters. When Saruman and Gandalf fight in LOTR Jackson said he didn't want anything clichd like Wizard Lightning. Yet in the Hobbit Gandalf's flash of light suddenly becomes a fireball killing hundreds of goblins at a time. Well gee Gandalf. Why didn't you tell us you could do that?Jackson's elves have never looked like elves in any movie More like blonde people with pointy ears but in LOTR his dwarfs looked like dwarfs. In The Hobbit most of the dwarfs look like humans. Ridiculously Aragon... sorry Thorin ... is man candy for female cinemagoers. What do you think ladies? Come for the disembowelments? Stay for the romance? Like the whole Liv Tyler character he wrote into LOTR it just doesn't work. Jackson needs to do a few romcoms to get it out of his system.The CGI is very overdone. Characters fall from great heights. They get squashed by rocks. They walk away without a scratch. It feels a lot like a video game. You never feel emotionally invested. If Jackson must do rewrites he should have killed some of the dwarfs. There are 13 of them after all and losing a couple would have helped the audience care more about the ones that are left.In the book the goblins lived in tunnels. In the movie they live in absurdly overdone CGI caverns. Someone needs to tell Jackson sometimes less is more.How did Jackson a director with such a good track record make such a bad movie? Sometimes directors come out with good movies e.g. George Lucas and we think they are the hand of god. But then they come out with more movies and you wonder if there isn't some luck involved or uncredited people in the background who weren't there this time? Jackson's King Kong shows not everything he touches turns to gold. Jackson is obviously overconfident and the studio was too but like George Lucas even if Jackson laid a steaming turd it would still make been hugely profitable. We've already hailed Jackson a genius so he has nothing to prove to us except to make a lot of money. He's also very into video games. This movie feels very much like a video game.The only good parts in this movie Smaug's raid at the beginning and Gollum's riddle scene. For 15 minutes out of 3 hours you will be entertained. The rest is slow boring and emotionally unengaging silly without being funny. The CGI is overdone. Being a Middle Earth story many people will see the movie anyway and most will be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I hated pretty much everything about this movie but here are the main pointsExpanding on Tolkien's mythology Presumably the reason you should never trust an Elf! Gimli's line in TFotR is because Elves turned their back on the Dwarfs when they were being attacked by Smaug? What were they expected to do against a dragon and why were they just standing there anyway? This is basically adding a whole new level of mythology. A nono unless it's an improvement and that's not the case here.The dwarfs They looked ridiculous to me and their behavior was annoying. But no dwarf was more offputting than Thorin with his ludicrous furtrimmed leather duster Rob Zombie do and constant glowering. Ugh.The introductory scene takes too long but given all this time you'd think Jackson would try and be more faithful to the book. But no he still manages to mangle it. Anyway the next day after Bilbo has decided not to go the day before he wasn't really given the choice in the book he justgoes. And it's very interesting that he's able to on foot overtake Gandalf and the dwarfs all riding along briskly on horseback. And when he does catch up he's offered a pony which he at first declines. Why? Bilbo had nothing against riding a pony.Azog The footnote springs to cinematic life and has a vendetta against Thorin. But the character in the LotR Appendix for all of his twopages of appearance and death at the hands of Din is still more badass than the video game reject in AUJ. Anyway if Jackson wanted to go this route it would have made more sense to just go with Azog's son Bolg who will appear anyway.Trolls or how to take an amusing sequence from the book and drain it of any humor whatsoever. Actually that opinion applies to the whole movie. But instead of Gandalf employing ventriloquism on the trolls and getting them to fight each other Bilbo tells them the dwarfs have parasites and Gandalf gets to break a rock in two. Yawn.Radagast An utterly ridiculous and repellent visualization of another footnote character with his ridiculous dying hedgehog rabbitdrawn sleigh and poosmeared face. But that's just my opinion. But why is he in the movie at all? To tell Gandalf about the Necromancer I guess. But if Gandalf doesn't already know this as he does in the book where did he get the map and key from Thrin Thorin's father who in the book was a prisoner in Dol Guldur? Presumably he wasn't in Dol Guldur in the movie. So where is he? It's basically glossed over. In any case the very idea that Greenwood is turning into Mirkwood right before Radagast's eyes at the start of the movie just strikes me as a desperate and weak attempt to create a sense of urgency and menace. The spiders are even seen entering the forest as if to take up their positions. Also in any case Gandalf's very reason for being in Middle Earth is to help combat the Necromancer aka Sauron. For him not to know about his presence in Mirkwood is sorry just witless.Apparent invulnerability None of the protagonists get hurt in this movie. Stone giants fall on them they get up. They fall a hundred feet they just walk it off. Goblins who for some reason are portrayed as distinct from orcs attack in droves they just cut them down like wheat. Thorin does later fall unconscious from a blow that should have crushed his skull but he later turns out none the worse for wear. Even if these characters weren't profoundly irritating why should I care about them if they're not in any danger? And enough with the fake deaths. Did anyone watching this really fear the titular character might fall to his death halfway through his own movie?Riddles in the Dark Finally some resemblance to the book except even here there are details changed for no good reason. And couldn't they have toned down the lighting just a bit more to give some impression of darkness? As for Gollum himself it's hard to find fault with Andy Serkis except that Gollum is now basically a celebrity and practically played like one in the film. He no longer surprises frightens or disturbs in the least. The cosy lighting doesn't help at all.Bilbo the Badass Bilbo kills a Warg which though strong enough to uproot a tree will drop with a single arrow or sword thrusthack. Later he savagely kills an orc. Where'd this come from? Perhaps to make up for Frodo being a wuss in those other movies? Whatever the case it's so far out of left field it's just seems tacked on.Eagles Gandalf just happens to spot a moth nearby in the tree he's climbed up to avoid the orcs and wargs. How convenient. And the book's explanation for the eagles doesn't work because? There really is no good reason. Jackson wants to make full use of the eagles but only as devices he's averse to giving them any back story or personality or anything. You'd think with his apparent love of exposition and the characters making speeches all the time something could have been said about them but no the eagles just drop them off and depart. They're nothing more than deus ex machina. Granted there are challenges to following the book more closely here but I still think Jackson takes the cheap way out.Final scene Bilbo blithely states I do believe the worst is behind us. Really? Why would he believe this while looking at a mountain that is 1 still leagues distant and 2 he knows contains a firebreathing dragon? I will be surprised if even morbid curiosity compels me to watch any more of these.".

	schema:headline " Huge disappointment";
	schema:reviewBody "If misstepping were an aerobic exercise Peter Jackson would be in excellent shape. Although I am loath to admit it this adaptation of The Hobbit is unsatisfactory in many many ways. It strikes me as Tolkien meets Bad Taste meets Braindead meets the Feeblest excuse for a threefilm extravaganza. After foolishly buying tickets for two screenings in advance I have now had the displeasure of seeing the film twice in 3D HFR. The experience leaves me embarrassed to have invested so much gleeful anticipation into the release of this film. It very nearly taints my love for the LotR films though in the end that love remains intact. Here are just a few of the serious issues I observed 1. The screenplay departs wildly from the heart of this whimsical tale. Two themes are central to the book first the moral bankruptcy arising from greed and the lust for gold. This stems in part from Tolkien's adaptation of the Volsungsaga wherein a dwarf turns into a dragon through greed. Thorin is becoming a dragon metaphorically. Second the selfdiscovery of Bilbo and his emerging moral strength set within the symbolism of a seasonal journey from spring to spring. This first film does almost nothing to set up these points aside from some cringeworthy and heavyhanded dialogue that violates PJ's oftstated stricture against saying instead of showing in film. Bilbo's development is too sudden and inadequately motivated in the film. What little emotional payoff exists is forced and manipulated not earned by what precedes.2. Other weak choices in the screenplay include the following a inappropriate lowbrow humor is the whole audience supposed to be ten years old? b frequent pointless references to LotR dialogue compare The key is yours now to The ring is yours now to cite just one example c excessive exposition and flashbacks and d heavyhanded clunkers everywhere along the lines of Legolas's a diversion zinger in RotK for example if there's a key there must be a door or after sickness bad things happen. Seems the screenwriters aren't counting on an intelligent audience.3. Mystifying errors a the grass is golden brown in the land before Rivendell. It should be June not late summer. One expects more green. Yet Thorin says earlier that the summer has nearly passed. This ruins the seasonal symbolism of the journey. This is not the muchvaunted fidelity to text. Jackson invents material needlessly and never for the better b Why do the dwarfs gawk at Balin's backstory about Thorin as if they hadn't already heard it? c Why is there no blood on Bilbo's sword after he stabs the orc near the end of the movie? This road goes ever on and on but I'll stop here.4. Mystifying plotstory decisions fodder for cuts a Azog is ridiculous fakelooking and pointless b Radagast has no place in this film and is beyond ridiculous with his birdpoop hair and stupid bunnysled c even RankinBass understood that the place for the Erebor backstory was to insert visuals over the song at Bag End the song is an oral history of dwarfs. So PJ gave us the same story twice and the first time told by the wrong person Bilbo d the stone giants are way over the top recycling Moria and Caradhras staging from FotR and badly overstating the way Tolkien tends to invest nature with intention e the White Council should at best have been shifted to the second film as part of the Mirkwood material the desperate attempt to darken the story by including the Necromancer completely unbalanced the tone. Overall the narrative structure of the film is confused with a gross overemphasis on setpiece action so unbelievable as to jar the viewer right out of the film. It lacks enchantment and it lacks an understanding of the source material.5. The 3D HFR though spectacular at times is a nearly total catastrophe or perhaps the film was not ready for release. Everything outdoors is badly overlit. The worst example is the company riding through a rainstorm where a they appear to be moving in between the raindrops and b the sun appears to be shining everywhere from all directions. The characters do not blend organically with their environments. Rivendell looks like a matte painting. The film is often but not always ugly period. And I don't see how the 3D served the storytelling at all moths flying out into the theater notwithstanding. Spectacle is not a substitute for character development and emotional resonance both of which this film sorely lacked.Enough. Sir Peter please I beg of you try to fix these sorts of problems in the next two films. This entry was dreadful in spite of the widespread apparent fan adulation. You are better than this. I fear the cinematic precious is lost . . . loooost!".

I'm saying this so that one understands that I'm not the type of person who will blindly speak greatly of any film of the TolkienJackson series if I don't feel it deserves it.This being said I have difficulties understanding some of the negative professional reviews which said The Hobbit is a failed attempt and not as good as LOTR. The artistic and directing style are exactly the same so I won't comment on this more. I also wasn't expecting to like the 48 fps since I'm the kind of guy who squints even at high definition TVs but surprisingly I thought it looked great in The Hobbit and I think 48 fps is the future. There are slow moments in The Hobbit broken regularly by excitingly over the top action scenes. Again just like LOTR  so I don't see why one would like the original trilogy and not The Hobbit.The Hobbit is perhaps a little less dark in tone than LOTR considering the source material which is more of a children's book but it's clearly not a children's movie anyway and displays many exciting and stressful moments. It also offers something more than the LOTR that is five genuinely important villains right then and there. The dragon Smaug in this first film is like Sauron in the LOTR. A distant mysterious figure who is the ultimate goal of the quest whom we don't see much of yet but we know it's going to be brutal. The necromancer is mostly alluded. Those who know the book will know who that is and he'll surely be important in the sequels. Azog the giant orc is a main villain and is much more appealing than the Urukhai chief in Fellowship of the Ring or any other orc villain in the LOTR series. The Goblin King also has a strong key role in the movie. And of course Gollum who's riddle scene with Bilbo is fantastic.Martin Freeman as Bilbo is superb and there couldn't be a better choice. The rest of the cast is pitch perfect as well. While the 13 dwarfs are too many for us to get to know each and every one of them well enough by the end of this first movie I didn't feel it was a downer. We got to know at least a third sufficiently  and I'm sure we'll get to learn about and appreciate the rest in the subsequent films  this allows us to still have characters to discover later on.Anyway great film. I think it's better than Fellowship and I'll be seeing it again for sure and can't wait for the sequels.".

Whereas in the LOTR trilogy you really got that sense of a grand cinematic epic it just wasn't there in this version. I really wanted it to be something new and exciting but it looked gimmicky and false a lot of the time only the latter scenes with the Pale Orc and Bilibo's encounter with Gollum drew me into the movie. At times the image crystal clear as its was did feel like a HD home camcorder had been used and certain scenes did seem sped up. What is interesting is watching the trailer at home on a home cinema setup it looked much more like LOTR in quality and feel then the IMAX version. This is the first ever movie using this technology so I will give it the benefit of the doubt but eagerly await the BluRay in a years time.The story itself suffers from the feeling of being padded out at every opportunity I have no idea why we had to see cameo's of Frodo and Galadriel I believe even Legolas will make an appearance in a future episode. The Hobbit is a very different story which can be read in an afternoon it does not need to be a 9 hour epic like it's predecessors.The dwarfs comedy seemed over hammed feeling very corny at times the troll scene was nowhere near as good as the books and why omit Gandalf's voice throwing?I'm not even going anywhere near the mess that a certain Brown wizard brought to the film.As a lifelong fan of Tolkien's work and Mr Jackson's LOTR trilogy I left very disappointed.Here's hoping the second installment is an Empire Strikes Back and redeems PJ's credibility".

	schema:reviewBody "The Hobbit is a relatively short book written as a prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is NOT a trilogy and even though LOTR is comfortably presented as a trilogy it was written to be one very long book in three parts.The Hobbit would have made a fine movie a single movie. There is enough characters places and creepy scary things to jampack a good 2 12 hour cinematic experience. But Jackson lost when he took a short book wrote a screenplay for three movies added unnecessary characters and plot lines wholly irrelevant to Tolkien's intent failed to expand on perfectly good themes inherent in the book and overwhelmed the viewer with a saturated screen in almost every scene.In the first places dwarfs work in mines traditionally because they are small humans with corresponding human strength and they can fit where normal humans cannot go. Funny thing is most of the dwarfs in this movie do not look like dwarfs at all! Inasmuch as I love Bilbo Baggins and the choice of the adorable Martin Freeman was an excellent one this movie should have been called Thorin Oakenshield rather than The Hobbit. Most of the story and camera time is spent on Thorin and his greedy pursuit of gold which is changed for political correctness to read we need a homeland!. I would have loved to have seen more of the Shire more of Bilbo doing his Hobbty things BEFORE the deluge of the 13 uninvited dwarfs.The best scene in the entire movie was with Bilbo and Gollum. Fine camerawork excellent CGI excellent acting perfect timing. Serkus should get an Oscar whether the character is CGI or not.One of my favorite scenes in The Hobbit is the rescue from the Orcs by the eagles. Tolkien is clear to show the size difference between the races of Middle Earth large wizard small dwarfs even smaller Hobbit. I was disappointed that in most scenes Bilbo looks the same size as the dwarfs. It would have been sharper and truer to the story to make sure he was CGIed into a smaller fellow yet.The Hobbit was written for a younger audience than LOTR and the language and imagery is thus more suitable to preteens. If Jackson had kept the childlike nature of the story going rather than making a good half or more of it of fierce endless and repetitive battle scenes it would have been a better movie. No charm! No magic! it was just a bunch of brutal battles where everyone continues to escape unscathed! A cartoon version would have been more realistic.The funniest scene in the whole movie would be for Monty Python fans alone. When the group reaches sight of the elven city Bilbo exclaims his face full to the camera RIVENDELL!!! It reminded me of Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table in turn exclaiming CAMELOT! shhhh! it's only a model I cannot believe that Jackson could not see that reference or maybe he really did!Jackson has gotten too MiddleEarthed for his own good. My hope is that the next installments produce some of the charm of the BilboGollum scene without loosing the beauty of its New Zealand scenery. Slow down less fighting more time to see the scenery more time to know the characters. We don't need more big sloppy ugly things to fight!".

	schema:headline " Strays from the book...and cheapens the story";
	schema:reviewBody "First let me say the Lord of the Rings movies were all firstrate and stayed pretty close to the original Tolkien books. Unfortunately The Hobbit is not because it does not. It really is a bad movie by design. Choices were made to add slapstick comedy and fabricate added story lines which bloat rather than add to the movie and quite simply to stray from the book liberally presumably for commercial reasons. The choice to do so is curious given the overwhelming success commercial and critical of the LOTR formula of being faithful to the books.Radagast for example who was mentioned in name only in the book appears in the movie as something of an idiot wizard riding a sleigh powered by eight tiny... bunnies. I'm not kidding. This is perhaps the worst example of how Peter Jackson has botched the story and put the LOTR movie franchise at risk of ruin presumably to appeal to a younger crowd and stretch it into 3 movies for commercial purposes. There are many other examples of this which cause you to leave Tolkien's world and wonder why the story was cheapened and botched at the hands of a director who did so well with the LOTR trilogy.I didn't mind fleshing out the 'necromancer' story line that was only hinted at in the book. But so many of the best scenes in the first part of the book were all disappointing in the movie having been altered for the worse. Lastly I don't like how they changed the character of Bilbo Baggins. In the book Bilbo and the dwarfs for that matter are basically out matched and scared when the meet up with each of the foes in the first part of the book. Bilbo after reluctantly joining the group is basically scared and miserable the whole first part of the book. In the movie Bilbo is portrayed more as a homebody who'd just rather be at home but not terribly scared of trolls or orcs or goblins or dragons they're just not really his cup of tea. And the somewhat fabricated theme toward the end of Bilbo deciding to help the dwarfs 'find their home' and help them get their home back is another disappointing alteration.There are many smaller details of the movie that also work to cheapen it but I think you get the picture. The only reason for 2stars instead of 1star is the production values which are as good as the LOTR trilogy. The movie is nominated for a makeup and production design Academy Awards but a telling comparison with the LOTR trilogy is the absence of any nominations for writing or direction or picture. Both 'Fellowship'  'Return' won best adapted screenplayand were nominated for Best Picture 'Return' won. The Hobbit could be nominated for worstadapted screenplay and seems was a conscious if incredibly poor choice by the writers and director who did so well adapting LOTR to the screen.Equally disappointing is what might have been. Instead of adding superfluous story lines they could have made The Hobbit much smaller in scale compared to LOTR which it is and more personal. Instead of starting with a Bilbo that is something of a homebody and not into adventures they could have started with a Bilbo who secretly always wanted to go on an adventure but was too afraid and too conforming to society to do so until Gandalf pushed him along in the book Bilbo was always into maps etc. which is meant to suggest this. From there they could have portrayed the company of dwarfs as serious and determined in their purpose but totally unprepared for the challenges that awaited them. There could have also been some focus on how miserable Bilbo was in the conditions the mud no foodand longing for home and the friction and disrespect for him by most of the dwarfs. They might have also included how the elves made fun of them when they arrived in Rivendell and Gandalf's own disdain for many of their failings and that their adventure isn't his main concern. Adding a troll scene that was true to the book would make a far more compelling Act I.Act II could have started with the company entering the mountains and the cave scene. Instead of having them fall hundreds of feet through a trap door unscathed followed by an hour of slapstick gore battle sequences they could have had the goblins catch them and bring them chained through the tight confines of the dark tunnels in the book rather than the expansive open pits in the movie. Being faithful to the book in this case would have led to more suspense and terror like when the Black Riders first appeared in 'Fellowship'. That would have set the stage for Bilbo's encounter with Gollum and a more tense drawnout riddle scene where Bilbo is more at risk and Gollum in control. After a tense escape from the tunnels once again finding themselves outmatched by the goblins and wargs as they get trapped a top burning pine trees as in the book only to be saved once again this time by the eagles. Expanding the 'necromancer' story line which I thought a worthwhile addition might add some time and make it about a 2 hour movie with still plenty of plot for an additional 2 hour finale.As it was I came away thinking of a line that Gandalf used after recounting the story of Bullroarer Took to Bilbo early in the movie. When Bilbo replied you made that up Gandalf replied all good stories have some embellishments. Perhaps this line served as a bad excuse for what was to follow. The Hobbit already was a good fantasy story as time has proved. It didn't need slapstick and gore embellishments. It's too bad Peter Jackson couldn't leave well enough alone to the ruin of the LOTR movie franchise.".

Jackson had four screenwriters which may explain why this movie is such a muddle and may also explain its inordinate length. I figure that after all the movies are made I'll be able read the book faster than watch all three movies. The movie is very slow moving even many of the fight sequences. I fell asleep at one point and awoke dismayed that the movie still had an hour to go. SpoilersSpoilersSpoilers The tedium of the movies was not its only problem. Apparently the quartet of writers think they are better writers than Tolkien. So many things were changed in the movie that it would take too long to enumerate them all. The worst was the treatment of Radagast the Brown who was not even really in the book. Instead of making him a wizard of intelligence and power he was portrayed as a buffoon in rags complete with bird droppings all over his head. The only bright spots in the movie were Martin Freeman as Bilbo and Andy Serkis as Gollum. The scene where Bilbo acquires the ring of power is straight from the book and worth watching.

	schema:reviewBody "Firstly I have to make a statement the LOTR movies for me have set an impossibly high bar both in this universe and within the movie world as a whole. Their cinematic beauty and value cannot be denied.The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey however is an entirely different movie. Sure it's set in the world of Middle Earth but that's really about all it holds in common with the aforementioned trilogy alongside a few familiar faces. Many members of the audience I was in complained that the movie took a long time to get going but it actually was paced rather well with a suitably sized introduction with Ian Holm and Elijah Wood making way for the current storyline. The first thing you notice as a viewer is that this movie is notably funnier. Whilst the LOTR trilogy had it's lighter moments The Hobbit revels in the lighter side of life with lots of genuinely hilarious moments interspersing themselves with scenes of real peril.The visually stunning moments are still there and whilst I saw this movie in 2D some moments would have been absolutely perfect in 3D. At first it's a little difficult to get into especially when the lighthearted opening with the countless visiting dwarfs gets underway. However if you can remind yourself as a viewer that The Hobbit was a book written for a much younger impressionable audience then you'll likely have a good time watching this. That said it is far from childish and although it is a lighter more fun affair there are still many parts within the story that an adult audience can relate to.Martin Freeman has been a firm favourite of mine since his humble beginnings on British terrestrial television and seeing him here on the big screen is both a welcome and bizarre experience. That said his demeanour and technique are perfect for the role of Bilbo Baggins as he exudes the homely simple manner of a Hobbit very effectively. Ian McKellen is perfect as everyone's favourite wizard and Richard Armitage another former British television star playing his trade to the silver screenis a brilliant Thorin son of Thrain! mixing a toughened heart with a tortured soul. If anything Thorin may turn out to be the true hero of the piece. The rest of the dwarfs are also brilliant and many of them are the highlights of the movie.The special effects are once again spectacular with the eye wateringly stunning rock giant battle a particularly memorable moment. The makeup effects are up to the job too and the attention to detail is ridiculous right down to the individual scratches and weathered look of the weapons the characters wield. If you enjoyed the LOTR trilogy then Peter Jackson will have you in awe again although The Hobbit trilogy looks set to be a much more relaxed and 'fun' adventure. At the end of the day the only complain to be made about the movie is that it simply isn't LOTR. Those movies set such a high level that even Peter Jackson himself can't seem to top them with this effort but that's a minor complain for what is otherwise I very well made movie.Cinematic adventurous enjoyable and epic The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey knows its audience and caters to them very well indeed.".

	schema:headline " The first of three long films based on a short book";
	schema:reviewBody "As this film opens an elderly Bilbo Baggins explains how the once great Dwarfs were forced out of their mountain kingdom by the dragon Smaug. He begins to talk of a great adventure and we are transported back to shortly before the adventure began when a young Bilbo meets the wizard Gandalf the Grey. He invites Bilbo on an adventure but he declines the next day thirteen Dwarfs turn up at Bilbo's home believing that they have been invited. They tell him of their quest but he initially refuses he has no desire to leave home. The next morning he changes his mind and so begins a quest that will see them fighting trolls orcs and goblins as well as meeting elves another wizard and in Bilbo's case the somewhat crazed Smeagol who will become a lifelong enemy following the theft of a certain ring.Before watching this the main criticism I'd heard was that breaking the story into three long films was a mistake having seen it I'm inclined to agree. The story took too long to get started and when it did it got nowhere fast the party had a succession of battles but there was never the sense of danger that there was in the Lord of the Rings films. Another weakness was the fact that the party was a large group of dwarfs with one hobbit and one wizard rather than the more mixed group in the earlier trilogy only a couple of them stood out from the group the rest were very much the same. On the plus side the film looked great with many sweeping shots though action set in a spectacular landscape and the actors did a decent enough job I particularly enjoyed seeing Andy Serkis' return as Smeagol even though he is doing motioncapture work for a CGI character. Overall I'd say this is worth watching if you enjoyed the Lord of the Rings trilogy even though it isn't as good as those films hopefully the next instalment will improve matters.".

	schema:reviewBody "On learning that The Hobbit a 400 page children's book was to be extended over three films Unexpected Journey being the first it seemed Peter Jackson may have been seeking a compromise between the children friendly book and the more darker and foreboding LOTR trilogy. Unsurprisingly An Unexpected Journey fails to transcend the source material although it is debatable if this was Jackson's intention.The first fifty minutes is actually the most impactful Gollum's appearance not too far behind. There are nice homage's to LOTR and it provides the necessary backstory. Most importantly it enables the twelve dwarfs to be more than a generic rabble just fighting and squabbling. Martin Freeman starts as he ends the film playing Bilbo Baggins with aplomb in a fine performance providing the understated and yet determined nature of the intrepid adventurer. Once Bilbo leaves Bag End however the magic ceases.The rest of the film is a number of setpieces which fail to propel the story. What we have is an A to B to C without an emotional arch or purposeful plot. One continues to watch An Unexpected Journey waiting for Jackson to rein in on the needless superfluous activity but it does not happen. It is at this juncture that one begins to accept rather belatedly that An Unexpected Journey is not the crossover adaptation that one may have hoped. Jackson's 'offthemap' excursion with Elrond Galadriel Gandalf and Saruman only help to conflate rather than placate the elder viewer.The special effects are satisfactory if not altogether an improvement on LOTR. Unfortunately this is for me An Unexpected Journey's biggest fault. It becomes apparent through the effects that Jackson has decided pardon the juxtaposition 'evilfriendly'. The appearance of the Great Goblin and his cohorts Azogand his wolves are much less menacing than LOTR and have an intentional illusory and nonfrightening composition. Can one even forgive the overintrusive nature of the subtitles? If more credence is needed that An Unexpected Journey is a more youthful creation one only need to look at the manner in which Bilbo comes across Gollum and the way in which the Company fall into the Goblin Kingdom. One has to suspend disbelief at the comic book survival skills of the party noticeably altered from the book too.An Unexpected Journey does have its moments. There is some fun bravado a couple of meaningful montages and some much needed pathos. The acting is of the highest quality.I have to conclude that An Unexpected Journey was intended for a younger audience and I cannot begrudge Jackson for this. However the three hour long running time is just unnecessary when to all intents and purposes a longer film would be more inclined to an older audience. As a consequence An Unexpected Journey should be cut with big scissors. A big disappointment and I only hope that parts two and three try to provide a more menacing and intelligent crossover.".

	schema:reviewBody "Majidi's 'Baran' is cinema at its purest. There is no background music. No prominent special effect. The female lead does not speak a word. It's filmed in the simplest way. It's not a colourful film and yet it is so stunning to look at because the raw Iranian landscape is beautifully captured. Majidi's films have always been subtle. He depicts the hardship of Afghan refugees in Iran very well especially the struggle between both the Iranians and the Afghans and the consequences. The story revolves around Lateef and the title character Baran. Initially Lateef loathes her but as his attraction towards Baran grows stronger he is drawn towards her. Their love story is beautifully displayed as pure and innocent. Not a word is exchanged between Lateef and Baran and this simply shows that love need not be explained with words or even touch but with action and Lateef's sacrifice proves the depth of his love. Majidi also adds a touch of humour that adds to the genuine charm of the film. He makes some astonishingly clever use of symbolism such as the last scene when Lateef looks back at Baran's footprint after she has departed it represents the print she left on his heart. Hossein Abedini is fantastic as Lateef. His sublime transformation from the brattish selfish and vindictive boy to the passionate kind and selfless lover is phenomenal. Moreover the fact that a newcomer played the part makes it more incredible. The young and stunning Zahra Bahrami is equally amazing. The actress does not get one line to say yet her nonverbal acting is stupendous. The supporting cast though most of them include nonprofessionals look authentic. To me 'Baran' was truly a unique and enlightening experience. Films like this are a rare 'breed'. They are not easy to find.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't you go letting life harden your heart . . . we can let the circumstances of our lives harden us so that we become increasingly resentful and afraid or we can let them soften us and make us kinder. We always have the choice.' ...The Dalai LamaBaran is the latest film from the director of Children of Heaven and Color of Paradise. It has strong appeal because of the natural performances of its nonprofessional actors its welldrawn characters and its message of the transforming power of generosity. Like Kandahar our attention is drawn to the desperate plight of the Afghan people.Baran begins with a note about the reality of the 1.4 million refugees from Afghanistan living in Iran a number that has probably increased substantially since September 11th. Some are of the current generation that was born in Iran and have never set foot in Afghanistan others have recently fled from Taliban oppression and long to return home. Afghans are forbidden to hold jobs by Iranian law and must work illegally usually in unskilled heavy labor jobs.Shot in the style of the Italian NeoRealists realistic stories told against real backgrounds with sometimes nonprofessional casts Baran has a tone of drabness only occasionally interrupted with bursts of color. At a construction site in Northern Tehran Memar Mohammad Amir Naji employs a large number of Afghans to work along side of Turks and Iranians. This film shows a microcosm of the bluecollar working class in today's Tehran. Many languages are spoken and the film sheds some light on the variety of ethnic groups present in Iran. In spite of some harsh treatment of workers Memar has moments of generosity and humor and his outwardly harsh exterior seems to mask a genuine sympathy for the workers. A 17 year old Iranian tea boy Latif Hossein Abedini an Iranian Azeri feels his job is threatened by a new worker Rahmat Zahra Bahrami who comes to work when his father is injured on the job. Rahmat has difficulty performing construction tasks and is moved to the kitchen to prepare and serve the tea essentially switching jobs with Latif. Latif short tempered to begin with now takes out after Rahmat intent on getting revenge leading to a series of slapstick encounters that are almost Chaplinesque in tone. After Latif discovers Rahmat's secret he is a she named Baran the film is devoted to his transformation from a selfish wise guy to a caring and surprisingly generous young man. The film becomes a series of encounters in which Latif infatuated with Rahmat secretly tries to help her in any way possible donating his entire savings to her family and involving himself in protecting her from the hands of inspectors looking for illegal immigrants.Though I found Baran to be at times somewhat repetitious and dramatically weak it doesn't help that Latif and Rahmat never interact it is a humanistic film full of warmth and humor. Though a film about dehumanizing working conditions its true focus is the emotional awakening of a young man who has discovered his own self worth through the act of kindness to another perhaps symbolizing the discovery of the plight of Afghans by the Western world. Baran also translated as Rain the symbol for springtime builds to a poignant climax leaving Latif with the wistful image of a footstep in rainsplattered mud an image that may remain with him as a constant inspiration for future selfsacrifice.".

This film shows a microcosm of the bluecollar working class in today's Tehran. Many languages are spoken and the film sheds some light on the variety of ethnic groups present in Iran. In spite of some harsh treatment of workers Memar has moments of generosity and humor and his outwardly harsh exterior seems to mask a genuine sympathy for the workers. A 17 year old Iranian tea boy Latif Hossein Abedini an Iranian Azeri feels his job is threatened by a new worker Rahmat Zahra Bahrami who comes to work when his father is injured on the job. Rahmat has difficulty performing construction tasks and is moved to the kitchen to prepare and serve the tea essentially switching jobs with Latif. Latif short tempered to begin with now takes out after Rahmat intent on getting revenge leading to a series of slapstick encounters that are almost Chaplinesque in tone. After Latif discovers Rahmat's secret he is a she named Baran the film is devoted to his transformation from a selfish wise guy to a caring and surprisingly generous young man. The film becomes a series of encounters in which Latif infatuated with Rahmat secretly tries to help her in any way possible donating his entire savings to her family and involving himself in protecting her from the hands of inspectors looking for illegal immigrants.Though I found Baran to be at times somewhat repetitious and dramatically weak it doesn't help that Latif and Rahmat never interact it is a humanistic film full of warmth and humor. Though a film about dehumanizing working conditions its true focus is the emotional awakening of a young man who has discovered his own self worth through the act of kindness to another perhaps symbolizing the discovery of the plight of Afghans by the Western world. Baran also translated as Rain the symbol for springtime builds to a poignant climax leaving Latif with the wistful image of a footstep in rainsplattered mud an image that may remain with him as a constant inspiration for future selfsacrifice.";

As impeccable and human as that one comes Baran. What an amazing film. You don't see these type of characters every day. They barely speak in most of the occasions but they show emotions.The whole piece beautifully and well done that it really touches deep. These situations and these people make the film so watchable. Lateef is a normal person he spends his everyday life as anyone else working earning the money for his life although he hasn't received that money yet but he will. Soltan works there also although he shouldn't as many other workers. Soltan brings a boy one day and after some events this boy steals it's a way to put it Lateef's job. He's angry we get it. But he sees some time after a girl behind a curtain in a beautiful scene with a patient camera watching carefully both angles. A girl he used to know as a boy and he is shocked. He has fallen in love.After this nothing matters only this girl Baran we hear from her father and if you don't listen carefully you'll miss it because it's the only time the word is said. Then we join Lateef in his journey for love. He's desperate. He sees Baran suffering and ends lying to his boss to get some money for her. To help her.One of the most incredible things in the story is the development of this boy's personality. He wants to help but at the same time doesn't want the people he's helping to know it. He wastes his time in the invention of stupid excuses just to hide himself. Hiding himself from who? From this girl the reason of his changes and efforts? Why? He wants to be with her.The last scenes come as magical and one of a kind as the ones in The Children of Heaven. Lateef sits and contemplates a curtain similar to the image seen the fist time he discovers Baran. Now he is making decisions but only in his mind because it is late already. The next morning Baran is leaving I guess it's not important where. He helps her to pick some things she has dropped. She sees him and completely knows the things he has been doing for her. Then she just smiles and gets in the truck. She leaves he watches.Maybe he'll regret it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rarely do we see a natural masterpiece reminiscent of the great Italian neorealist directors. Many people will sadly miss this film simply because it doesn't have the marketing or star power of a Hollywood film. The Iranian Majid Majidi directs his film with a natural neorealist flair without effects or a big budget. His story of forbidden love is classic the principal characters Lateef and Baran start off awkwardly since Baran dressed as a boy Rahmat in disguise takes Lateef's job at a construction site in Iran. Lateef is an argumentative troublemaker who becomes jealous and treats Rahmat badly until he realizes Rahmat is a girl Baran. He becomes embarrassed and goes about mending his ways. Baran is obviously put off and confused by Lateef's oafishness and cruelty towards her. But at the end after when they picked up the fruits and when she stumbles into the mud he replaces her shoe she could not take her eyes off him. The construction foreman Memar played by Mohammad Amir Naji is a brilliant actor full of character and charisma. Zahra Bahrami who plays BaranRahmat never says a word but her facial expressions and pain in doing manual labor is brilliant. In a way she reminds me of the silent characters in the Korean offbeat film 3Iron or Binjip. Hossein Abedini who plays Lateef is not a great actor although he has good moments. But aside from him the movie was quite masterful. Most reviews discuss the touching story and today's cultural taboos in central Asia or the artful direction of Majidi. But I would like to add that the film's most beautiful moments are the directors and cinematographer's collaboration of capturing absolutely stunning moments much like you'd expect from the best of National Geogaphic's or Life's old magazine best photographers. The simplyhung curtains in the doorways swaying in the wind was a brlliant clich of passing time. Lateef's hat with Baran's hairpin which he placed by the fish pond was stunning. The timing of both scenes in its lengthy pause so simple was brilliant. Near the end the crisscrossing of the hands in picking up fruits is a symbol of the affection he feels for her. Following that was the simply brilliant slow motion of Baran flipping her aquagreen burka headdress back into place signifying her unavailability. It seemed so cruel but culturally inevitable. The poverty of the characters and richness of the film contradict but capture the essence of humanity at its deepest. I love this film and I rate a 9.5 not a 10 which appears here of 10 only because Hossein Abedini could have been a stronger lead.".

There's no way Lateef can win her hand but its a complete triumph of love.What a brilliant film. I am not into love stories but this film is definitely a love story par excellence. Plot is so brilliant and is executed with such finesse. The passion in the heart of the protagonist is just unbelievable and is a treat to watch. Majidi is such a fantastic director. All the obstacles and difficulties Lateef faces are social and political problems. Story looks like a love story but Majidi actually talks about women problems refugees illegal workers immigration problems and of course conflict of right and wrong defined in a society. There are so many things Lateef does for Baran which I ended up thinking 'not possible' but the real question is 'isnt love selfless?'. 'Baran' is a film which haunts a thinking brain. A film which doesn't answer questions but ask questions. The construction site where Lateef works is in Northern Tehran. Mehar employs Afghanis to work with Turks and Iranians thanks Howard Schumann . There are actually so many things going on in this film.Hossein Abedini as Lateef is fantastic. He is Lateef and nobody else can be Lateef. Zahra Bahrami doesn't have dialogs but she is very good. Mohammad Amir Naji is a fantastic actor. If he is on the screen then you just look at him and rest is 'backdrop'. One of the few complete actors in my dictionary of actors. My favorite scene is when Lateef comes to know about the fact that Baran is a girl and so hear wears some trendy clothes and come to brick laying. Memar looks at him and say why are you dressed like a pop star?. I laughed so much. I use this phrase very often. Two thumbs up. I think the whole Indian film industry with 200 films on love is a dwarf in front of this divine story about love and selflessness. A must watch. 1010.".

It shows the meaning of the true art to open horizons to excite the mind and to comfort the heart. Friendship love sacrifice but overall a profound metanoia are all bursting step by step as the events unfold and lead us following the hero to a state of profound accomplishment in which love transforms everything around even a trivial rain pouring in a foot's mark.";

By the way the leading actor Lateef is not Kurdish as written in plot. I believe he is Azeri because he speaks Azeri in some part of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Majid Majidi has made some amazing films though sadly few in the West have probably seen them since he hails from a land not especially known for its film industry Iran. In fact finding DVDs of his and other Iranian films is pretty difficult. I don't think this is especially because of political tensions between Iran and the US but more of a general ignorance in my country that there even IS a foreign film industry aside from perhaps the French and Japanese. It's a shame really as the three Majidi films I've seen CHILDREN OF HEAVEN THE COLOR OF PARADISE and this film are among the most visually stunning and beautifully made films I have seen. His films are almost like visual poetry and they concern ordinary peoplenot the famous or especially beautifuland this is what endears his films to many people. While I was not blown away by the film like I was by THE COLOR OF PARADISE which I would place in the top 10 best international films I have ever seen the look and delicate directorial touch make this a wonderful film to see.The film is set mostly on an Iranian construction site. Many of the workers are Afghans who have left their country due to the war. However they don't have identity papers and can't legally work in Iran so the foreman employs them under the table so to speak. But this isn't necessarily out of charityit's just that he can pay them a fraction of an Iranian worker much like many of the illegals in the US from Mexico. In fact this foreman is an odd manat times he seems very stingy and cruel but at others you are surprised by his compassion. This didn't come as a surprise to me as in other Majidi films I have noticed that the characters are often complex and hard to predict. The certainly are NOT formulaic or dull but rich in goodness as well as character defects. In fact the entire film later rests on this dualitybut more of that in a bit.One day one of the Afghan workers is badly injured on the job. And since they work illegally the man cannot work and his family will starve. However a ruse is created in order to have his daughter employed by the construction site. She dresses as a man and is a lumpera term used to describe an unskilled construction worker who does the work no one else wants to do. But since she is a woman lifting and doing this hard work is beyond her means. But when the foreman feels sorry for her and switches her to an easier job the man who had this easier job as a gofer is madso mad he decides to make life tough for this new man on the job! Oddly however after being so cruel and thoughtless later the angry worker discovers that she is a female!! Now you'd think he'd tell the boss and get her fired...right?! But instead compassion and goodness comes from within and he has a strong urge to help her in her plight. But when soon after this ALL the Afghan workers are fired what is this man to do? How can he help her when she and her family have seemingly disappeared?Overall it's a very complex character study of a man who behaves inexplicably once he learns the woman's secret. Now I am NOT saying he reacts in a way that is impossible to believe...but it's just hard to imagine until you see that the man has hidden goodness and strength within him. Oddly however I just couldn't predict where this film would go and when the movie ended I found myself a bit confusednot in a bad way but I just wouldn't have imagined ending the film this way. It's a wonderful filmnearly earning a 9 but I am hesitant to give such high ratings. Plus the other two films I mentioned that Majidi also made are clearly better filmsmostly because they tug at your heart even more and feature some amazing performances by kids something that is NOT easy to create. Well worth seeing.By the way this film was entered by Iran for the Oscars but was not nominated. This lack of a nomination is a bit of a surpriseperhaps it was just a very strong year in that category.".

	schema:reviewBody "We need more of these films.Baran was a wonderfully written wonderfully directed feelgood movie. It's not a runofthemill schlock romantic comedy don't expect You've Got Mail or Runaway Bride. This is a harrowing tale of Afghani immigrants who must work illegally in Iran working twice as hard as Iranis and getting paid much less all to stay alive. And by staying alive I mean rockbottom handtomouth survival.It's also about selfrealization and how human beings are capable of putting others before them and of sacrificing everything to help someone in need.When an Afghani worker is injured at a construction site he sends his son to take his place so that he can feed his family. Latif an Irani worker at the site is an arrogant and shorttempered boy who picks on the Afghanis the most. He lights into the new boy twice as much when the boy rather weak ends up taking his cushy job of brewing and serving tea to the other workers. He is resentful and bitter as he's forced to harder labour and even more so when the workers all comment on how amazing the new boy's tea is and how awful Latif's was. He tries to make life unbearably miserable for the new boy day in and day out until one day he makes a startling discovery the new boy isn't a boy. Latif immediately changes his attitude trying to help the 'boy' and defending and protecting her rights and treatment. At first it's merely because he's attracted but he slowly gets more and more intrigued then begins to genuinely want to help her as he himself goes through a period of selfrealization and selfsacrifice.The movie is tender and touching well paced and beautifully shot. Some of the cinematography is simply breathtaking. The characters of Latif Baran the girl and Memar the overseer at the site are especially strong. This film is a definite mustsee it helped to restore my faith in humanity as even seeing this kind of film on screen strengthens the heart. We need more of these films!! 810.".

The everpresent subtext  the state of life in Talibanera Afghanistan the exodus of the Afghan work force from the country and the plight of Afghan refugees abroad  gives the romantic side of the story urgency and perhaps makes the rather unreal Latif seem considerably more realistic or even politically daring. The camera work throughout BARAN is also exceptional  the construction site is captured in great detail through the graceful and uncluttered cinematography by Mohammad Davudi the harshness of Teheran's environment this film features some of the most effective use of rain snow and fog this side of a Kurosawa epic is casually everpresent and serves to underscore the intensity of the story and the scenes set in the Afghan refugee settlement are uncomplicated in their minimal beauty and are consistently devastating in their emotional power.

It tells the tale of the 1950 US World Cup team that shockingly beat England though did not win the World Cup itself It begins in St Louis providing backgrounds and insight into the lives and families of the St Louisians who later will be on the World Cup Team.Strong performances from Wes Bentley and Gerard Butler lead this film to the final victory. Bentley and Butler portray the leaders of the team Walter Bahr and Frank Borghi respectively with likability and believability. The supporting cast that rounds out the team also turn out performances that will keep you involved with wanting to route for this team. Don't expect an electric atmosphere however as this story is told from a reporter reminiscing. The Game of Their Lives offers character development for the team members without ever straying from the subject at hand. Through their actions on and off the field the audience can get a taste for who these men were. Much homage and respect is also deservingly paid to England for their magnificent history in the sport. This is not one of those ports films that serves to make the United States seem over glorious and under mind the greatness of England as many assume it will. I for one walked away from this film with a greater respect for England and what they've done and continue to do for the sport".

	schema:reviewBody "This film records the most unlikely upset in World Cup history the 10 United States defeat of England in the Brazilian mining city of Belo Horizonte Beautiful Horizon 300 miles north of Rio di Janeiro on June 29 1950. The United States was a team of part time amateurs who were drawn against the mighty English squad playing in its first World Cup and determined to show the world their mastery of the game they had invented. Football fans who saw the score reported assumed the score line was a typographical error as it was unthinkable that the US could even stay with much less defeat an English side which featured some of the games all time great players including Billy Wright Sir Stanley Matthews who sat out the match Stan Mortenson and Wilf Mannion. London bookmakers offered odds of 5001 against such an preposterous event. The New York Times refused to run the score when it was first reported deeming it a hoax. The US team was a collection of first generation American soccer players drawn mainly from club teams on the east coast and included five St. Louisans four of whom grew up in the Hill neighborhood of South St. Louis goalie Frank Borghi fullback Frank Colombo forward Gino Pariani and midfielder Frank Pee Wee Wallace and also the long time St. Louis University soccer coach halfback Harry Keough. The US had only one full time professional player on its roster Hugh McIllvenny from Scotland. They had played together only two weeks when they departed for Brazil. They'd lost to Italy in a World Cup warm up by the score of 90 and had been defeated by Spain in the World Cup opener 31.It was reported that the American players were so confident that victory was unlikely that several of them were out late the night before the game enjoying themselves and sported hangovers at the opening kickoff. Borghi was quoted afterwards as saying he was hoping to hold the English to five or six goals. The English team poured forward firing shot after shot at goalie Borghi but could not score. Six minutes before half time U.S. center forward Joe Gaetgens a Haitian born dishwasher living in New York redirected with a lunging header a shot by half back Walter Bahr who is himself incidentally the long time Penn State soccer coach and the father of NFL placekickers and former Penn State soccer players Chris and Matt Bahr. The misdirected shot beat England keeper Bert Williams and the single goal stood up through a second half where the Americans withstood constant English pressure and numerous near misses including three shots off the woodwork.The Brazilian crowd thoroughly enjoyed the failures of the pretournament favorites and carried the US team off the field after the final whistle. The game was noteworthy for the complete lack of interest in the result by the American press and public. The only American reporter at the game Dent McSkimming of the St. Louis Post Dispatch used his vacation time and paid his own way to Brazil to cover the game. Author Geoffrey Douglas' book advances the premise that the victory was not a fluke when one considers the character and promise of the winning American players as evidenced by the upstanding and honorable men they came to be.Trivia the English national soccer team has never again worn blue shirts they wore against the US in that game.The film was shot on location in St. Louis and Brazil and features former US National Soccer Team Captain John Harkes as a consultant and soccer playing extra.".

Saw it in a theater with only 3 other people  at noon on a Monday raining  but it didn't matter because I was engaged and wrapped up in the 1950's story of a bunch of ordinary guys who did something extraordinary.Based on a real event with real still living people it is about heros of WWII who came home and went about their lives until asked to form a team for the World Cup soccer matches. They have only weeks and decide to get some players from the east coast and some from one area of St. Louis MO. from the Italian enclave known as The Hill.Frank Borghi Gerard Butler is the goalie and a leader of the group. The challenge is to get the whole group to pull together and mesh the different styles to make a team that may make a good showing. They don't expect to win as most of the teams they will play are more or less professionals andor have played together for years.The soccer playing is exciting even for this old gal who knows little about the game. The cinematography is very good and keeps the pace of the game and shots of the crowds and sports announcers ticking along and by the end when time runs out on the English players and the Americans have won this great upset I was ready to cheer too.I disagree with most of the reviews I have read. This is a good sports movie and the performances and pacing are as good as Rudy or any other underdog film.One thing I loved was the look of the people and homes and cars. It was the 1950's again and the music I danced to was just right. One for my movie collection. 910".

Researching the annals of Sports headlines would not necessarily provide you with the correct information as the win was so astonishing that the final score of 01 was assumed by British journalists to be a typo and was reported as an English victory of 101! And the American Press was too busy covering the onset of the Korean War to pay much attention to the unexpected triumph by a hastily throwntogether U.S. team in a sport which had not yet caught on in the States.The Game of Their Lives exists to correct this glaring omission in Sports History. David Anspaugh Hoosiers Rudy has directed the quintessential Soccer movie compelling in its simplicity. Forced by an extremely limited budget to pare this true story down to its bare bones what emerges is a straightforward accounting of the American Spirit. On my way to the St. Louis premiere an African taxi driver put it succinctly yet enthusiastically commenting Yes! Yes! That's what you Americans do! You make up your minds pull things together and get things done! The minimalist story is told in flashback. Patrick Stewart Yes Star Trek lends his authoritative voice to narration in the role of Dent McSkimming the only American reporter to cover the game in Brazil traveling at his own expense. The setting is primarily the Hill a working class ItalianAmerican neighborhood of St. Louis MO. Against a visually accurate if somewhat nostalgic depiction of postWW2 optimism and Family Values the team players selected just weeks before the first round World Cup matches are introduced. It is immediately clear from their devotion to the game that Soccer is a thinlyveiled metaphor for Life for these amateurs. Against this backdrop of a simpler time a resultoriented male psyche is exposed.Gerard Butler gives a standout performance as Frank Borghi the steadfast Goalie who is the heart of the team. Mr. Butler has demonstrated incredible range in recent films going from action hero Tomb Raider II to big budget musical Phantom of the Opera to independent foreign film Dear Frankie to this neardocumentary Sports ensemble piece. Just as Borghi is the glue which cements the U.S. team Butler holds the cast together with an unrelenting presence. His measured determination is balanced against the frustrated pessimism of the titular Team Captain the lessthancharismatic yet eminently practical Walter Bahr  who went on to coach at Penn State played by Wes Bentley American Beauty. Also turning in notable performances are the Mandylor brothers Costas and Louis together in a movie for the first time portraying unrelated players. The personal stories rivet the audience to the chain of events which culminate in the eponymous game.The match in question was played and shot on location in Brazil. Despite foreknowledge of the outcome game play is heartstoppingly exciting and the camera angles place you in the thick of the competition. There is some real Soccer being played on screen! Although I am not an avid Sports fan I was surprised to find myself on the edge of my seat and carried away by the immediacy of the action. At the premiere in St. Louis it was heartwarming to see several of the original players in person including Frank Borghi being finally honored after 55 years for their remarkable achievement.".

	schema:reviewBody "My soccer team and our coach all St. Louis Public High people decided to go see Game of Their Lives today opening day. We went to the Chase one of the three theaters in the area where the movie was playing. We were hyped no matter what  It was the weekend and we were a bunch of teenage girls going to go see a movie. None of us actually expected a great movie though. We were happily surprised though.The movie started off introducing the tale  the who what where when and whys of it all. The St. Louis PostDispatch journalist Dent McSkimming retells this information and relays us back to 1950. We are introduced to the St. Louis members of the team in a rather amusing manner in which the team gathers from such venues as a funeral... They gather down at the Hill where a good deal of the film was filmed and play a game. For soccer fans these scenes are really fun to watch and wonder how the scenes must have been choreographed. It really is amazing.In addition to the St. Louis members there are East Coasters who join the team. The team ends up being rather segregated between the two groups. The teams are brought together by the leaders from each side Walter Bahr the amazing Wes Bentley and Frank Borghi the equally amazing Gerard Butler. The two have a great on screen chemistry especially when they go to recruit Joe Gatjaens played by Jimmy JeanLouis.The whole cast is amazing but none more so than the three forementioned actors who really truly seemed to become the soccer player they were portraying. It was a lot of fun to cheer with the rest of the theater every time Frank Mr. Butler stops the ball or when Joe Mr. Jean Lewis scores the game winning goal against the Brits. Jay Rodan is also particularly amusing as PeeWee Wallace. It's hard not to like the characters you're supposed to like and equally as hard not to dislike the ones you're supposed to dislike such as Gavin Rossdale as Stanley Mortensen.It was also fun to sit in a theater filled with people who were actually in the movie. The Chase was packed with extras who were eager to cheer out every time they were on screen. The man sitting next to our coach plays the barber in the very beginning of the film and told us to cheer for him when he came on. So of course we did. Then as soon as his part was over he stood up and said 'All right that's it for me' and left. It was absolutely hilarious. The man in front of us had pictures of him and Gerard Butler at the Premier which was held in St. Louis. This film has been something that has united St. Louisans and anyone from the city should go see it. It is an amazing deal of fun to see the little car place across from Adrianna's home of the best sandwich in the city and the field up at Soldan High or the Bocce field on the Hill. It shows the real St. Louis.All in all this was an amazing movie that everyone should see especially those from St. Louis and those who have ever played or watched soccer. It's a great story no matter what. And the film isn't too long either... So if you don't like it  well you don't have to sit through it for too long now that's what I call logic.910 stars I just can't call it perfect... Awfully close though.".

So if you don't like it  well you don't have to sit through it for too long now that's what I call logic.910 stars I just can't call it perfect... Awfully close though.";

	schema:reviewBody "THE GAME OF THEIR LIVES was a very good movie. It was a very good movie that I think could've been a great movie.There really isn't any need for spoilers because it is a sports movieand sports movies have happy victorious endings about 99 of the time. But this story isn't really about the endingwhich any viewer could predictit is more about a team coming together at the last minute and working to form cohesion and camaraderie while facing unbeatable odds.When the US World Cup team was formed it was mainly comprised of 2 groups the players from St. Louis' Hill and the East Coasters. A lot of these men had played soccer well but not professionally. They were men with other jobs like a mailman undertakers and a dish washer. The 2 groups had different styles to overcome and each had its own leader Frank Borghi Gerard Butler led the men from the Hill and Walter Bahr Wes Bentley led the East Coasters. I really enjoyed these two characters. The film did an excellent job of showing their effort to create a sense of team spirit in a very limited amount of time.There are plenty of colorful characters in the film which strengthened the point of how they were all plucked from their lives for a mere 3 weeks to head down to Brazil and play their hearts out. There was Pee Wallace who is afraid to fly and Gino Parianiwho are known as a lethal combo on the field or pitch. There's Charlie Colombo and Joe GatjaensCharlie who wears gloves for every game and Joea Haitianwho turns cartwheels and shows infectious optimism. There's Harry Keough the young mailman learning Spanish at home so he can converse with his girlfriend.Many of these men were veterans. Many of them had been awarded during the service and several had had psychological after effects from WWII. Perhaps it was because of having served their country in that capacity that they felt the patriotism necessary to give their game that extra umph. The film gives you just enough of their personal lives to get to know them and spends the majority of its time on the team after it has been formed but before the legendary game. The ending is somewhat abruptI feltin that the second the game is over so is the movie. You get the obligatory reintroduction of the characters by showing the actual men now aged and few who were on the team but I wish there had been somethingeven a paragraph that appeared on the screenthat gave the audience some closure with these players with which we had invested the last 90 minutes.Overall however it was very enjoyable and interesting.P.S. To those diehard Gerry Butler fansyou'll enjoy the scenery a lot.".

	schema:headline " Possibly the worst sports film of all time";
	schema:reviewBody "Certainly there have been sports films that were more technically unacceptable to this one but never in the history of celluloid has so much carelessness for a true account been displayed on the silver screen. The Game of Their Lives is a revolting untrue story of the United States' 1950 World Cup upset of England. Having read the book the film is loosely and I do mean loosely based on the story plays on film like a madeforDisney Sunday night TV movie. The half truths in this debacle start right from the outset as the St. Louis playground team gets notice of a World Cup tryout. The World Cup in 1950 was not the World Cup of today. It was only the fourth tournament and first since 1938. For the players to suggest at that point in time that World Cup was considered the greatest sporting event in the world was for all intents and purposes false. The glamor and glitz associated with the World Cup did not come until later. According to the book there wasn't much of a St. LouisNew York rivalry. It wasn't like the 1980 Olympic hockey team with its MinnesotaBoston rivalry. The players if I remember correctly came together without much fuss and did their job. The preoccupation with Stanley Mortensen is a mystery too. Did I hear correctly during the banquet introduction speech where he was introduced as scoring three goals in the FA Cup final in 1950? Sorry. That didn't happen until three years later. The book also said nothing about a scathing Mortensen speech. I highly doubt it would be in any player's nature to stand up and directly insult a team which had no chance of making an impact. And...The USA did NOT open the 1950 World Cup against England. They lost 31 to Spain a mere four days earlier playing well against another good side. That game probably illustrated that the Americans weren't exactly a ragtag bunch more than the England one but the filmmakers didn't mention it. Or the 52 loss to Chile which ended the Yanks tournament. And guess what? After all the excitement made over topping England the U.S.A. finished last in the group. England only picked up two points a win was worth two points back then and not three against Chile. So the win over England might have been more of a story of a fading power than a miraculous upset. The crux of the book was the players relationship to their families and athletics. It only gets a basic treatment in the film. As for Haitian goal scorer Joe Gaetjens the filmmakers treat his character like a right loon who is deeply under the spell of voodoo. It's laughable and racist to some degree in how he is portrayed. There also is no discussion of his life after he scores a goal. The film suddenly ends after the win. Sure we get to see the remaining remembers of the real team get a nod at the 2004 MLS AllStar game but what about the others? Joe I'm afraid wasn't one of them as he was kidnapped and killed in Haiti for political reasons in the 1960s. Why wasn't that in the film? The absolute worst part of the film was the presentation of the uniforms. First of all was not the constant begging for uniforms like the Bad News Bears a bit pathetic? A general or some highranking military schmoe presents the players with the new uniforms on a tarmac in Brazil. What we get here is some of the most vile military to sports comparisons you'll ever see. It's the kind of stuff that makes you curl up and wonder what other countries will think when they see it. In fact the whole movie is.".

The film defines the characters showing their Italian roots as well as their pride at being Americans without crossing the line into stereotype. Their are a couple of moments that appear as if they're heading in that direction but then the film deftly veers around it. The scenes on the pitch are exciting and compelling particularly the ultimate match with the English. Even though the outcome is a matter of record I was still captivated. Part of the reason for this might be all those shots of walking pheromone Gerard Butler as goalie Frank Borghi. DisclaimerMr. Butler was the real reason I picked up this little film.

The director was leery of the film from the beginning and admitted that he doubted a movie tied to soccer would be successful. He said that his intention was to put out the best American soccer movie ever made. The casting director did a decent job of casting actors with some although greatly limited soccer ability. The actor's lack of footskills was combated by camera techniques and angles. The movie was a great historical reminder of a team which was not well enough known to be forgotten.

Up to this time they didn't know how they fared against foreign teams as they hardly played them  a couple of years later they played Hungary and got the shock of their lives when they lost 72. Football in England was and is a working class game. In the film they depicted the England players with upper middle class accents. Stan Mortenson was a Geordie and had a Geordie accent. The rest of the team would have had working class accents too. At the time the England players  so called professionals  were earning less than the 100 per week promised to the part time Americans nothing was made of this irony. These English players would be subsidizing their incomes from football with regular jobs  some of them in the mines some working behind the counters in shops. It wasn't till a few years later that the maximum wage was lifted and the potential to earn the fortune some of them now earn happened. This film was full of jingoistic music and some of the patriotic lines made me cringe at one point Stan Mortenson said to the captain of the American team at the coin toss 'there's no need to make it a war out there today' and the American captain said 'if it was a war you'd be dead' totally unnecessary and not funny. The great footballsoccer film will be made one day when someone makes the story of Manchester United and the recovery after the Munich air crash which wiped put most of the team.".

This film was full of jingoistic music and some of the patriotic lines made me cringe at one point Stan Mortenson said to the captain of the American team at the coin toss 'there's no need to make it a war out there today' and the American captain said 'if it was a war you'd be dead' totally unnecessary and not funny. The great footballsoccer film will be made one day when someone makes the story of Manchester United and the recovery after the Munich air crash which wiped put most of the team.";

The director spends an hour introducing the characters many of whom are underdeveloped and others who are unlikeable. They introduce a negro player who the coach insists can't join the team but the next day he joins and no one offers an explanation as to why it was so easy for him to join but that's o.k. since the coach never explained why he couldn't join in the first place. John Rhys Davies plays the coach and if you find Davies a fairly lame actor you won't be disappointed he is dry and flat here as well. On to the big tune up game well it was kind of quick and for some reason in the 2 minutes they show of the game they decide the center must go!!. The audience knows not why since we never saw him play in those 2 minutes nor does the director show explain the importance of his role on the team 11 players on the field the center is the reason the team sucks you'd think this would be a nice time to touch on a few points about the role of center in soccer. On to the big game. The first half is 4 minutes then the coach comes in for a lameo speech proving him the least inspiring leader written for the silver screenkind of sad when you consider they had days into the shoot for dramatic rewrite way to go MR. Director the second half is 3 minutes and the film ends without the audience being lifted by the event! Perhaps the director should have spent less time under developing unlikeable characters and more time on the heart and soul of the game because there was no drama!!! no sign of exhaustion by the players no sacrifice on the field no sign of I assure you this director had no game plan taking on this project!! In fact he had less than that since the 1950 U.S. World Cup team had no game plan but walked away with a victory!! Not even worth a 5.50 walmart dump bin purchase. I gave it a 4 since I could at least see an effort but it was a bad movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK... if ever there was a movie that needs to be taken with a pinch of salt then this is it. In the final present day scenes the voice over actually says still considered the greatest upset in World Cup history which actually made me laugh out loud. I'd be interested to know who actually thinks that. So let's get a few facts straight.England and I do mean England not the Brits as they are referred to in the movie were not considered the best team in the world that was Brazil. The World Cup in 1950 was not the event it is today. Many of the best teams were not present due to the cost of getting a team over to Brazil. The game was a first round group game so nobody won anything or even progressed. In fact the US lost their other two games and England proved they weren't the best by losing to Spain as well. All of this seems to be conveniently omitted from the movie.However I will forgive all of this and focus on the single event which seems to be the movies intention. The Game of Their Lives as a title is somewhat off the mark. A better title might be The Day England Couldn't Hit A Barn Door or perhaps The Keeper Played A Blinder. These kind of games happen all the time in football. The best team hits the woodwork several times their striker misses a sitter or two the opposition keeper plays out of his skin. Then the underdogs get a dodgy penalty or an own goal or as in this case a deflected shot goes in. And there we have it 10.And that's the problem with the movie it just wasn't that big a deal. This has happened many times in World Cup history. Korea beating Italy in '66 Algeria beating West Germany in '82 Cameroon beating Argentina in '90 Senegal beating France and Korea beating Italy again in '02. All these wins were against World Cup winners and are certainly considered bigger upsets in the scope of World Cup history. Even looking at this from the USA's point of view it's skewed. They made the semi finals in 1930 and in 2002 reached the Quarter Finals beating Portugal and Mexico along the way. Both these performances are more worthy than the 1950 exploits.So if we view the movie as an uplifting piece of fiction it doesn't really work. Nobody scored a miracle goal. The team didn't become champions. So in this sense it fails too. The movie is well made and the cinematography is great. Solid performances but very clichd characterisations. It just seems to me the screenplay picks and chooses which facts to go with and which ones to blatantly ignore. Including the first game against Spain would have added to the story. At least there would have been the element of winning off the back of a defeat.There are many better underdog movies out there most of which actually stick to the facts.".

Sure that one game is the focus of the story but I'd like to have seen it in better context.I thought the action was very well done. Gerard Butler certain did Frank Borghi proud and was totally believable as a worldclass goalkeeper and team leader. The best scene in the film had to be his slow mo prowl in front of the goal during the practice game in the rain against England's second team.

The other actors including a bit part by Patrick Stewart handle their rather weakly written parts adequately.The problem with the film though probably quite accurate in reporting a true incident the real and surviving original players form the team are included in the rather corny ending is that we really don't get to know the personalities of the team players well enough to create a successful drama. The majority of the film is shot during soccer games and that becomes monotonous to those of us who are not soccer devotees. But given that problem the film has a sweetness about it and an honesty that while bordering on saccharine does indeed emphasize the team spirit needed to conquer all odds.

Even when I found out the 2005 film had nothing to do with the earlier documentary I gave it a chance. It is definitely for people who like movies like Hoosiers and Boaz Yakin's Remember the Titans and want to see that kind of movie repackaged over and over and over again. The writer Angelo Pizzo and director David Anspaugh simply pulled out all the clichs of the underdog sports movie set it on a soccer field and then shot it. My gosh the inspirational lockerroom talk before they go attempt to topple the giants was like something you'd hear in a high school locker room coaches quoting from bad films. Let's see... Anspaugh and Pizzo have applied their formula to basketball and football and now soccer. Set your watches... we should have a standupandcheer baseball movie from them in about... two years. CAN'T WAIT!!!".

Even when I found out the 2005 film had nothing to do with the earlier documentary I gave it a chance. It is definitely for people who like movies like Hoosiers and Boaz Yakin's Remember the Titans and want to see that kind of movie repackaged over and over and over again. The writer Angelo Pizzo and director David Anspaugh simply pulled out all the clichs of the underdog sports movie set it on a soccer field and then shot it. My gosh the inspirational lockerroom talk before they go attempt to topple the giants was like something you'd hear in a high school locker room coaches quoting from bad films. Let's see... Anspaugh and Pizzo have applied their formula to basketball and football and now soccer. Set your watches... we should have a standupandcheer baseball movie from them in about... two years. CAN'T WAIT!!!";

	schema:reviewBody "Out of Universal Pictures comes Keep 'Em Flying starring the comedy team of Abbott and Costello with support from Martha Raye Dick Foran and Carol Bruce. It's directed by Arthur Lubin with music by Charles Previn and was filmed on location at the CalAero school in Ontario California. Plot sees the bumbling duo and their stunt pilot pal Jinx Roberts Foran join the Army Air Force after getting fired from their positions at a carnival  air show. High jinx and love interests will of course follow.The fifth film outing for Abbott and Costello and their third featuring the armed forces after Buck Privates  In The Navy Keep 'Em Flying is one of their better feature length productions. Tho somewhat surprisingly rather thick on plot the piece is all the better for some narrative substance in that it lets us savour the slaphappy antics of the intrepid duo when their routines come alive. Action sequences to savour here include a runaway torpedo a spooky carnival fun house and a short sharp shock treatment of Lou falling over his ankle grabbing pants. While there's quality in a dialogue driven skit that the boys perform in a Cafwhere we are introduced to the bright and bubbly Raye playing twin sisters who each end up dating the boys. There's also some nice tunes penned by Don Raye  Gene de Paul with the stand out being Pig Foot Pete that was famously nominated for an Academy Award but for the wrong movie Hellzapoppin'.Funny daft and even romantic Keep 'Em Flying soars high enough to entertain the masses. 810".

	onyx:emotionText "Out of Universal Pictures comes Keep 'Em Flying starring the comedy team of Abbott and Costello with support from Martha Raye Dick Foran and Carol Bruce. It's directed by Arthur Lubin with music by Charles Previn and was filmed on location at the CalAero school in Ontario California. Plot sees the bumbling duo and their stunt pilot pal Jinx Roberts Foran join the Army Air Force after getting fired from their positions at a carnival  air show. High jinx and love interests will of course follow.The fifth film outing for Abbott and Costello and their third featuring the armed forces after Buck Privates  In The Navy Keep 'Em Flying is one of their better feature length productions. Tho somewhat surprisingly rather thick on plot the piece is all the better for some narrative substance in that it lets us savour the slaphappy antics of the intrepid duo when their routines come alive. Action sequences to savour here include a runaway torpedo a spooky carnival fun house and a short sharp shock treatment of Lou falling over his ankle grabbing pants. While there's quality in a dialogue driven skit that the boys perform in a Cafwhere we are introduced to the bright and bubbly Raye playing twin sisters who each end up dating the boys. There's also some nice tunes penned by Don Raye  Gene de Paul with the stand out being Pig Foot Pete that was famously nominated for an Academy Award but for the wrong movie Hellzapoppin'.Funny daft and even romantic Keep 'Em Flying soars high enough to entertain the masses. 810";

This time the boys are perfectly integrated into the story and their gags flow along as part of the natural sequence of events.There is an excellent rapport between Martha Raye and our heroes which becomes evident in the USO canteen sequence. Not only was Martha a fine singer and dancer she was a great comedienne. Without giving away the gag the fact that it runs on so long and still remains funny is testament to the trio  or quartet's skill in working together.Okay I love this movie and given a limit of 10 movies to take to a desert island this would be included. But that says something doesn't it?".

After a disagreement with management all three of them quit and wind up in the Army Air Corps.For Foran he gets to renew a personal rivalry with William Gargan who's an instructor who had fired Foran once before in a civilian flying job. They're both interested in the lovely Carol Bruce who sings great and is a USO hostess. The boys are up to their usual monkeyshines. Seeing both of them on the back of a speeding torpedo was as funny as when they repeated the same gag on the back of a bucking bronco in Ride 'Em Cowboy.

Of course poor Costello doesn't realize they're twins and Martha's on and off attitude towards him is baffling. Later on the same twin gimmick was used by Betty Hutton in Here Come The Waves. Gene DePaul and Don Raye wrote the original songs for this film and actually came up with an Academy Award nomination for one of their songs Pigfoot Pete which Martha Raye sings and which is incorrectly credited in Academy records to another Universal Film Hellzapoppin'.

The best song in the film is one interpolated for Carol Bruce when we first meet her as a nightclub singer the Tommy Dorsey standard I'm Getting Sentimental Over You.Keep 'Em Flying is right in the great tradition of Buck Privates and In the Navy and still as funny today as when first made.".

	schema:reviewBody "KEEP 'EM FLYING Universal 1941 directed by Arthur Lubin marks the fifth screen collaboration of the popular comedy team of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello who in this venture take to the air and have quite a time staying on the ground. Previously appearing in the Army in BUCK PRIVATES 1941 and IN THE NAVY 1941 each featuring the Andrews Sisters what logical choice to find them back in peacetime military comedy this time with the Army Air Corps with Martha Raye and Carol Bruce stepping in for the Andrews Sisters.The story begins in a carnival where Jinx Roberts Dick Foran works as a daredevil stunt pilot. After getting fired by his boss McGonigle William B. Davidson Jinx along with his two assistants Blackie Bud Abbott and Heathcliff Lou Costello enlist at the army air corps at CalAero Academy. While there Jinx immediately meets and falls in love with Linda Joyce Carol Bruce a USO hostess and singer who has a jealous boyfriend William Gargan and brother Charles Lang who disapproves of him dating his sister while Jinx and Heathcliff encounter confusion after meeting up with Gloria Phelps who happens to have a twin sister Barbara both played by Martha Raye. In between these love matches comes a handful of Abbott and Costello routines and stunts that keep this film going at a fast pace for 86 minutes. There is also time out for music featuring some popular 40s tunes of the day by Don Raye and Gene DePaul including I'm Getting Sentimental Over You written by Ned Washington and George Bassman sung by Carol Bruce Pig Foot Pete Sung by Martha Raye Keep 'Em Flying sung by Dick Foran The Boy With the Wistful Eyes and Keep 'Em Flying reprise.Aside from the romantic subplots the movie relatively belongs to Abbott and Costello who supply the story with their comedy highlights The Go ahead order something routine where Blackie and Heathcliff only have a quarter to their name and go to a diner where Blackie orders only a turkey sandwich and a cup of coffee with the intention of splitting the order with his partner but whenever the waitress Raye asks for Heathcliff's order and says he doesn't want anything it is Blackie who coaxes him to order something only to give him a slap in the face and tell him that no matter how much he coaxes him he should refuse. This routine is further developed when the daffy waitress Raye gives Heathcliff a piece of cake on the house and when she goes to the kitchen the other her seriousminded twin sister Raye returns to find Heathcliffe with the cake and insisting that he'd pay for it. Other highlights include Heathcliff in the tunnel of love with one of the twin sisters Blackie and Heathcliff riding on a runaway torpedo all over the base followed by a couple of scenes involving the comedic dual taking to the air via plane and creating unintentional stunts of their own before parachuting to safety. In spite of obvious rear projection backgrounds these faults should be overlooked and simply enjoyed as originally intended. Featured in the supporting cast are Truman Bradley as Butch and Freddie Slack and his Six Hits. Martha Raye who adds twice as much fun playing twin sisters each partnered with Bud and Lou works well with the team. It seems a pity that she didn't get to work with Abbott and Costello again for that they make a wonderful trio. While a formula movie the plays strictly for laughs it is Costello who gets his rare opportunity on screen to show himself on the serious side in one scene early in the story when he pleads with a major to give him a job so that he could serve his country. This sequence could have been a low point but funny man Costello manages to make this brief moment followed by a patriotic speech believable and moving. He certainly was an original. While KEEP 'EM FLYING might be considered extremely dated by today's standards it still ranks one of the funnier comedies of the 1940s. KEEP 'EM FLYING is available on video cassette through MCA Home Video. Once presented on the cable television's The Comedy Channel in the early 1990s it resurfaced on New Year's Eve December 31 2000 on American Movie Classics where it played occasionally for almost two years.

	schema:reviewBody "When highflying stunt pilot Jinx Roberts joins the air corps his two assistants Blackie and Heathcliff follow him into the service out of loyalty and lack of other options. While Jinx gets a pilot's position they find themselves essentially at the level of janitors with little in the way of glamour or prestige. They end up causing more trouble than anything else  not least of which in the world of romance where the attention of twins Gloria and Barbara causes more confusion.This film was part of several made in a short period by Abbott  Costello in support of the war effort and the structure is roughly the same. A straight guy pursues a girl while Abbott and Costello trail along behind getting involved in various escapades and misunderstandings in support of the straight guy's romantic efforts. This should not surprise anyone and the only thing of concern should be whether or not the film is funny and makes good use of the comic abilities of the stars by which I do not mean Foran. The answer is sort of and it is because of this that the film is quite amusing for fans but not good enough to really win over others or stand out as one of their best. The plot with Jinx does take up a bit too much of the running time and as is often the case the film is padded out with too many songs although at least one of them is actually pretty good and I didn't find myself laughing often enough. There are some good bits though the scene where they order food in the restaurant is brilliant stuff and had me laughing out loud but a few good lines here and there and that is pretty much it. The torpedo sequence is the normal stuff but lacks inspiration while the flight stuff although quite good suffers badly from poor back projection and basic model work  OK both are of their time but still.The cast do reasonably well and the fault for the film perhaps being a bit lacking is not with their performances. Both Abbott and Costello do good work as you would expect but it is just a shame that they don't get better material to work with. What they do benefit from is a female costar who isn't just a cute love interest for Costello. Raye plays it in a way that echoes Costello's style but it does work and she is funny and adds a bit of variety which is needed when you consider the main plot. Bruce Gargan and Foran are all fairly dull and stiff  again it is a shame that they take so much of the time from the others.Keep 'em Flying is an OK Abbott  Costello film that has enough about it to please most fans however it is still not as funny as it should be and it has too much stuff that either pads the songs or detracts the main plot. If you like them it is worth a look but only a few scenes here and there show what the two are capable of.".

Raye plays it in a way that echoes Costello's style but it does work and she is funny and adds a bit of variety which is needed when you consider the main plot. Bruce Gargan and Foran are all fairly dull and stiff  again it is a shame that they take so much of the time from the others.Keep 'em Flying is an OK Abbott  Costello film that has enough about it to please most fans however it is still not as funny as it should be and it has too much stuff that either pads the songs or detracts the main plot. If you like them it is worth a look but only a few scenes here and there show what the two are capable of.";

Of the three this is definitely the least appealing and represented a step backwards of sorts for the duo. Like their other early films the comedians are forced into an awkward rolecomic relief and not the main characters though they do get top billing.This main character is Dick Foran and he plays a very very familiar sort of guyone that is a bit of a clich. Like so many of William Haines' films in the silent era Foran plays a knowitall hotshot who comes on very strong and doesn't listen to others. Whybecause he feels he is already so great he doesn't need to fit in to the team in this case the US Army Air Corps. Haines did this sort of film a bazillion times and Jimmy Cagney did a similar role in CAPTAINS OF THE CLOUDS. And like Cagney and Haines by the end of the film Foran is humbler and ready to play by the rules. This is just all too predictable and takes much of the film's focus away from Abbott and Costelloa major problem with the production.Another problem in this otherwise amiable film is the extensive use of stunts as well as rearprojection. While this might have worked once or perhaps twice it was used too often in the filmand made the humor very physical as well as a bit lame particularly the torpedo sceneuggh!.All in all a film that poorly used the talents of this teamwith too much Foran too many stunts and once again too much singing. Very watchable but also not at all among their best work.By the way if the diner skit where Bud tells Lou not to order anything since they don't have enough money this is a retread of the Laurel and Hardy skit from MEN O'WAR 1929. The only real difference is that Bud plays more of a jerk in this version and Stanley was a heck of a lot dumber in the original!".

It was released only a week or so before Pearl Harbor a very opportune time. I would also label it a musical comedy like it's predecessors. We have Carol Bruce Martha Raye Dick Foran and the Six Hits as lead singers.At a nightclub where Bud Abbott and Lou Costello are celebrating being fired from their circus jobs Carol sings I'm Getting Sentimental Over You. Foran hopes she means him and immediately strikes up a conversation with her. Their flirting will have its ups and downs through the picture. Later at an informal gathering Martha abetted by the Six Hits sings and dances to Pig Foot Pete. Then when Foran awakes one morning he sings the theme song Let's Keep 'em Flying. Back at the circus while drifting through the Tunnel of Love The Boy With the Wistful Eyes is sung first by Carol to Foran then by Martha in her Gloria incarnation to Lou then by Martha in her Barbara incarnation to Bud and lastly by the Six Hits to their girls. Near the end Carol sings the theme song again as part of the Air Show celebration. Seems to me this should have been the finale but we still have more flying misadventures to see. The plot is interesting if quite contrived. It begins with a circus moves to an air training center then back to the circus and finally back to the air training center. This provided potential comedic situations in two quite different settings.At the circus while Foran is buzzing the patrons with his aerial acrobatics AC are given the job of running the 'Kill the Umpire' game. Of course Lou is the umpire. Forget the patrons Lou is nearly killed by the bat that keeps hitting his head. When the same thing happens to their boss when he arrives they are fired along with Foran. When they later revisit the circus with their girls Lou has a couple of encounters with a gorilla and a walking skeleton. He finally figures out that Gloria and Barbara are two different girls thus Bud has not been butting in on his girl. Earlier he had been confused because both Gloria and Barbara had been working at the same small restaurant and they kept changing places. When Gloria asks Lou what starts the torpedo they are examining he demonstrates by pulling the pin. The torpedo on a wheeled cart takes off later with Lou on it and makes a tour of the airbase before detonating. Later AC illicitly take off in a plane and do cartwheels over the base before making a decent landing. Then they are in a plane with another pilot who tells them to bail out. But Lou doesn't know how to open his chute so lands on top of Bud's shoot partly destroying it landing on Bud who opens Lou's shoot to save them.Meanwhile Foran has been grounded for taking Carol's brotherJim up in a plane then parachuting out leaving Jim to pilot it himself with a stuck throttle. Following Foran's instructions Jim precariously lands it but is badly shaken up as the plane partly crashes. Foran then redeems himself by taking a risky move taking a plane up to try to save his flight instructor whose parachute got caught on the tail of the plane. In all a very fun enlistment promoter especially for kids with lots of comedy plenty of songs and some romance thrown in.".

	schema:headline " The last laughter before war hits the U.S.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the third and last of the armed services morale films that Universal made in 1941. All were with Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. Keep 'Em Flying reached theaters for general release in the U.S. on November 28. It likely was still playing in most theaters around the country nine days later when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. While the antics of Abbott and Costello surely helped calm the anxiety and tensions of many people in the months leading up the war after December 7 1941 people wouldn't be in the mood for comedy for a few more months especially regarding military service. Still America's favorite comedy team then had done much and they would do one short of a dozen comedy films during the war years to provide the home front and troops away with laughter. In Keep 'Em Flying Martha Raye and Carol Bruce replace The Andrews Sisters for the musical portion. Bud and Lou as Blackie and Heathcliff get into all kinds of mishaps around aviation. They follow a friend Jinx Roberts played by Dick Foran to Army pilot training camp and wind up as ground support. As with the earlier two service morale films 'Buck Privates and In the Navy this one has some historical value as well. The Army pilot training is done at CalAero Flight Academy. It was a civilian aviation school that had been started before WWII. With the war spreading in Europe and Japan expanding in the Far East the U.S. began building an Armed Forces from a peacetime military that was but a skeleton. The Army didn't have enough training pilots or facilities to quickly train the thousands of pilots that would be needed. It had pilot training schools in Alabama California and Texas but still needed more. So the Army contracted with CalAero to train pilots. The trainers were civilians but they operated under a military command with military procedures. That's what we see in this film. CalAero was located near Chino California east of Los Angeles. The CalAero Academy closed on Oct. 16 1944. It had trained 10365 fighter and bomber pilots for the war effort. In 1940 Army flight training had been reduced from nine to seven months in order to get more pilots ready. But that was reduced even further in early 1941 when flight training was set at 20 weeks as is the case in this movie. Also on June 20 of that year the Army Air Corps was redesignated the US Army Air Forces. USAF. It would be designated the U.S. Air Force and comprise a separate branch of the Armed Forces on Sept. 18 1947. At the end of the war the Chino Air field became one of the large airplane bone yards for surplus planes. Today the Chino Airport has a large air museum. One other historical note about this film is its introduction of the U.S.O. clubs. The United Service Organizations formed on February 4 1941 to provide entertainment and comforts for American service men and women away from home. Six groups responded to a request from Pres. Franklin Roosevelt and formed the U.S.O. They were the YMCA YWCA Salvation Army National Catholic Community Service National Jewish Welfare Board and National Travelers Aid Association. In this film we see a U.S.O club with its doors open outside the CalAero Academy. Martha Raye playing twin sisters Gloria and Barbara works at the USO as does Carol Bruce a singer who plays Linda Joyce. After the December 7 attack on Pearl Harbor young men flocked to recruiting stations around the country to sign up for military service. I can imagine that CalAero had a flood of applicants for its pilot training. And those pilots who graduated within two weeks of this film's release would be among the first wave of American aerial combatants to serve in Europe as well as at Army installations in the Pacific. Keep 'Em Flying has some excellent stunt flying sequences. The comedy romance flying locale and historical notes all add up to a fine movie. It makes a good addition to any film library for students of wartime or American military history or for those who have a comedy library.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is the third and last of the armed services morale films that Universal made in 1941. All were with Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. Keep 'Em Flying reached theaters for general release in the U.S. on November 28. It likely was still playing in most theaters around the country nine days later when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. While the antics of Abbott and Costello surely helped calm the anxiety and tensions of many people in the months leading up the war after December 7 1941 people wouldn't be in the mood for comedy for a few more months especially regarding military service. Still America's favorite comedy team then had done much and they would do one short of a dozen comedy films during the war years to provide the home front and troops away with laughter. In Keep 'Em Flying Martha Raye and Carol Bruce replace The Andrews Sisters for the musical portion. Bud and Lou as Blackie and Heathcliff get into all kinds of mishaps around aviation. They follow a friend Jinx Roberts played by Dick Foran to Army pilot training camp and wind up as ground support. As with the earlier two service morale films 'Buck Privates and In the Navy this one has some historical value as well. The Army pilot training is done at CalAero Flight Academy. It was a civilian aviation school that had been started before WWII. With the war spreading in Europe and Japan expanding in the Far East the U.S. began building an Armed Forces from a peacetime military that was but a skeleton. The Army didn't have enough training pilots or facilities to quickly train the thousands of pilots that would be needed. It had pilot training schools in Alabama California and Texas but still needed more. So the Army contracted with CalAero to train pilots.

Bud and Lou follow him in to the service at the training field. I detested his character immediately. Of course he comes around in the end. The comedy though is pretty good. Martha Raye plays seemingly nut case twins who are both in the USO and it is a great bit. Bud and Lou get worked over very well by the two different personalities Martha carries off with great vigor and talent. One twin Gloria pairs up with Lou from the start of the training. The scenes they worked out are hilarious as Gloria will say or do something and leave then return as the other twin and of course not knowing a thing about what went before things just get funny.

	schema:reviewBody "MWIAG is an action comedy based I believe on a Korean comic series. The blend is biased a little towards the comedy side but what quantity the action might like is more than made up for by quality.Backdrop Cha EunJin has been raised as a Jopog gangster since childhood and has risen through the ranks to 'Big Brother' no. 2 in the organisation. She also happens to be a female but this is a detail that is largely considered to be irrelevant  especially by her. She's smart confident ruthless and as luck would have it a fantastic fighter. The movie begins with a fight filmed in the rain with dark shadows and slow motion creating a very artful effect. Two gangster are up against a group of many and about to get killed when their savior appears  EunJin silhouetted against the light looking full on comicbook cool before she somersaults into the ground and spins kicks twists rolls and slashes her way through all comers. The dark lighting rain and camerawork create a wonderful look and mood for this and the choreography is easily up to anything Hong Kong has offered us for years. Short but very sweet.EunJin would possibly carry on like this happily for the rest of her life but the discovery of her sister whom she hasn't seen since childhood introduces new complexity. Her sister has cancer and may not live much longer. Her one wish is to see EunJin get married before she dies.EunJin's sudden need to address her feminine side and the fact that she wants the husband she chooses to remain unaware of her profession is the basic dynamic from which any number of comic situations are derived. The transplanting of her gangster persona  gangster cronies into totally nongangster circumstances is a cool 'fish out of water' scenario and very effectively spoofs the gangster attitudes and conventions.The main backbone of the movie as with most strong movies is the characters. EunJin is a wonderful character and the performance by Shin EunGyeong is absolutely spot on. Tough cool mean and thoroughly hilarious. The supporting cast are all just as well developed too.The movie is paced quite gently shifting from amusing situation to amusing situation without feeling the need to hurry the plot along too fast. Action scenes break out quite frequently but there is a marked difference between the 3 scenes in which EunJin fights beginning middle and end and the remainder of the action. Her men the thugs fight street  grappling stumbling beating with whatever they can reach. Sometimes this is played for laughs sometimes not. Realistic but not massively exciting. When EunJin fights however... it is a thing of beauty. Clearly modelled on HK action with a little Samurai thrown in too these scenes are amazingly choreographed and filmed. Between this and Bichunmoo which MWIAG easily surpasses and hopefully Musa when it arrives it looks like Korea is making a very strong bid for Hong Kong's action crown.If you buy the movie just for the action doubtless you'll love it  but really it's not the strongest part of the movie. The characters the performances and the humour are all equally well developed and fill more screen time. If you buy it for these... doubtless you will love it also. Can't really lose out on this one in fact ".

The style is typically KoreanGangster which is not a bad thing with comedy cuts thrown in appropriately. The main actress portrays a very modern side of a feminine character which you wouldn't everyday see owing to the make belief role. This itself makes you want to watch a bit more. The violence is quite rightly toned down for this genre but the action scenes still nicely filmed without too many slowmo shots. The sequel is evidence of this film's popularity which by the way should be watched in sequence as there are some backward references.".

	schema:headline " Interesting comedy drama";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS   SPOILERS My Wife Is A Gangster is an uneven Korean crime comedy which nevertheless has some interesting things to say about the role of the sexes in general and the place of women in particular. EunKyung Shin mostly familiar in the West from her appearance in the weird fantasy Uzumaki and Ring Virus 1999 plays Cha Eunjin alias Mantis also nicknamed 'Big Brother'. She's a fearsome number two in a crime organisation in charge of 50 men. Normally seen in blue business shirts and trousers she is a ultra cool deadly fighter feared and admired by those over whom she has control. Her unyielding side is fatally compromised however when she discovers her sister dying of cancer and who as a last wish asks her to get married and have a child. Meanwhile an opposing gang is causing trouble while Sboy a raw recruit to the gang from the country has to be shown the ropes...One could easily imagine this plot being remade by Hollywood for instance with Steve Martin as the gormless husband selected by the gangsteress to promote her marriage and pregnancy or Angeline Jolie in the title role. Many of the rough edges would undoubtedly have to be smoothed off in the process as My Wife Is A Gangster is surprisingly violent notably in the final scenes where the pregnant heroine is kicked in the stomach. As such it works as a Long Kiss Goodnight scenario in reverse as the nonnonsense action woman has to discoverreinvent her softer side. The action of the film is sandwiched between two major confrontations the first as the opening credit sequence roll is a startlingly stylish fight in the rain featuring the deadly flying knives of Eunjin and the last a revenge attack on those who have killed a popular henchman. In between there is another stylish knife fight this time a matter of honour between Eunjin and a Japanese martial arts expert whom she succeeds in defeating and reducing to 'a eunuch'. This confrontation set in long grass and rolling hills whether deliberate or not reminds one of the climax in Kurosawa's early masterpiece Sugato Sanshiro 1945. While not on that level and influenced by the cool shenanigans of The Matrix 1999 the present film makes the most of a fairly limited budget in the action department effectively conveying the casual violence of gangsterdom.In fact so insistent are the set pieces that the more frequent quieter moments of the film require some adjustment on the part of the viewer. Firsttime director Cho JinKyo has chosen a tricky property in terms of tone and has trouble balancing the fault line between villainous combat and the social comedy surrounding it. Eastern cinema of even the most serious genre kind can have a slapstick manner that's disconcerting to Western audiences. Fortunately a lot of that distraction is absent here although there is a peculiar scene in this film involving smelly feet a resuscitated cat and a tense stand off between gangs which works uneasily. The subplot featuring Shitboy and his mentor Romeo a ultracool henchman is more effective although their occasional Laurel and Hardy antics hardly connects with the main predicament of EunJin.It is Eunjin's concern for her sister that gives the film its heart. At her instigation she has to act out a different lifestyle softening her looks with makeup which involves a dating agency courting a man entering into marriage setting up home and eventually trying for a child. Having chivalrously  and unnecessarily  come to Eunjin's aid during a street fight Kang SuIl is quickly selected as a prospective groom being gullible and desperate for a mate. Proposing to the female gang leader with tender words from The Bridges Of Madison County after the marriage he soon realises that he is only allowed to touch her with permission that a Yakuzatype tattoo covers her back and his initial advances can be rejected with a kick to the groin. But once the need is felt to get herself pregnant then the process is reversed and in scenes satirical of the usual meek role allotted to wives in Eastern cinema she forces herself upon him at regular intervals. Much is very amusing parody whether it the sight of such a independent strong woman learning how to flirt and tease and even suck cock moments which recall those in Golden Chicken aka Gam Gai 2002 or just sitting demurely cold eyed with fury during the traditional romantic introductions. The excellently staged wedding scene set in a chapel stocked with nightclub girls gangsters and a punch up in a balloonfilled balcony is a highlight. Eunjin's henchmen make awkward witnesses to the happy event but they are persuaded to follow through this and her other increasingly bizarre lifestyle choices by a fierce loyalty to their leader. Her most realistic suitor worships her from afar after she brought him out of a coma but he is too intimidated by the debt to act upon his admiration.EunKyung Shin gives her difficult role suitable presence and one is almost convinced of the punishment her slender figure gives out to those who transgress against her. As the unlucky husband SangMyeon Park is also good as a man who gradually gains his self esteem and pride although his transformation to avenger and then leatherclad hero at the end of the film is less persuading. A similar transformation overtakes Sboy who with new hairstyle and cool dress sense promptly steps into the shoes of the absent Romeo to introduce the new bumpkin to the gang. And having been relieved of her responsibilities and promises by the death of her sister for Eunjin it's business as normal. But perhaps that is the point in a film that plays with sexual roles and stereotypes the changes and reversals we see in characters are often ludicrous pointing up social and cinematic stereotypes in a broad but effective fashion. It's worth seeking out although more accomplished less formulaic comedies are now emerging from Korea on DVD like Barking Dogs Don't Bite aka Flandersui gae 2000 and Attack The Gas Station aka Juyuso seubgyuksageun 1999.".

While it's not a revelation in any way and has major problems with story it's a mess I can easily see how the comedy and to a less extent the action could have carried audiences away.The strongest point of this film is the situational comedy that occurs between the protagonist Eunjin and her patsy husband Suil. Having a stone cold killer for a wife and a friendly naive and somewhat awkward civil servant for a husband leads to all sorts of situations you could probably imagine. Both actors easily handle their rather simply defined characters and manage to even inject them with a little personality.The action set pieces really clash against the overall tone of the film being quite violent and shot without any hint of humor. Although it's cut and uses handheld camera work for maximum confusionexcitementcovering up the stunt persons the actual choreography is pretty decent. But for a film of this nature the action is a little excessive and unnecessary so ultimately detracts from the strength of the film.The real issue with the film is the storyit relies on increasingly tired conceits to drive the comedy and melodrama. It's no spoiler that the only reason that the protagonist even bothers to get married is because of her sigh terminally ill sister. There is a lot of amusing and embarrassing comedy that's mined out of her desire to find a husband both around her interactions with potential suitors and her own feeble attempts at feminine wiles but the terminally ill sister is a wimpy and hardly believable conceit.There are also amusing pluses in her dealings with her underlings as well as in their own interactions and minor plot lines but again sledgehammerlike conceits are used to pummel these side stories into the main story leading to an ending that is difficult to really accept especially as characters seem to change not because of character development but because the writers made them change. It's all too much really.For all its faults My Wife Is A Gangster is still amusing enough to serve as an enjoyable and mindless film and I did find myself laughing because of some of the setups but the film really works overtime to try to come up with reasons to convince its viewers to believe its yarn and doesn't always succeed. But for what it is I suppose it could be worse. It's no must see and I would hesitate to even recommend it but if the premise intrigues you and you're looking for a few laughs and can stomach the heavyhanded attempts at manipulation there is enough to enjoy about this slick production. 610.".

I understood a great deal of the comedy and was surprised to be able to get most of the dramatic happenings.  That said most of the drama was lost on me I was only able to understand the basic gist of it.This did not stop me from enjoying the film.  I was surprised at how similar this film was to a Hollywood offering.  The 'wife' does action well and the closing scene was a good laugh.  Maybe if I understood the dialog I would have seen it coming but it was a funny surprise to me.  The hiphop closing credit song surprised me.  Funny how flexible western culture can be. I can understand how people of other nationalities can feel they are being 'invaded' and sense a loss of their own culture.  Perhaps if I watch it again the combination of reading other's reviews and having seen it once I would get a lot more from it.I am just starting to get into writing reviews and look forward to doing many more.".

That said most of the drama was lost on me I was only able to understand the basic gist of it.This did not stop me from enjoying the film.  I was surprised at how similar this film was to a Hollywood offering.  The 'wife' does action well and the closing scene was a good laugh.  Maybe if I understood the dialog I would have seen it coming but it was a funny surprise to me.  The hiphop closing credit song surprised me.  Funny how flexible western culture can be. I can understand how people of other nationalities can feel they are being 'invaded' and sense a loss of their own culture.  Perhaps if I watch it again the combination of reading other's reviews and having seen it once I would get a lot more from it.I am just starting to get into writing reviews and look forward to doing many more.";

She puts on a stern emotionless face for most of the movie. As if that were not enough she speaks very few lines. It is unusual for such an important character to have so little dialogue and facial expression. This certainly distances her from the audience. The character of the unfortunate husband is not much better as most of the time he is looking sad and making futile complaints about her behaviour. The movie therefore has to depend a lot on physical comedy and here it again fails because of the predictability of the situations and the cliches employed. How many times must we watch Eunjin threaten her meek husband? How many times must we endure the sight of her husband walking away sulking? Many potentially hilarious situations turn out to be rather unfunny thanks to the afore mentioned lack of dialogue and facial expression. Another problem is that the many subplots which are just as unaffecting and unfunny tend to make the movie drag. None of the supporting characters are interesting enough to make the audience care for them. The action sequences are well choreographed but they ultimately fail to save the movie.".

The movie is choppy and discombobulated and it's almost impossible to care at all about the characters.  The fight scenes are nothing new and bear little relation to the rest of the movie.  The humor is just pitiful  I think the low point would have to the mouthtomouth resuscitation of the cat straight out a bad Farrelly brothers knockoff.  Is it supposed to be funny when the husband a character I guess we're supposed to like? tries to rape his wife the titular character?  Most of the secondary characters get by with fart humor and smacks on the head.  If you want to see a funny Korean movie watch The Foul King or Attack the Gas Station I saw this with 5 other movie fans and we all thought it was terrible.

Wanting to keep her sister's spirits up EunJin hastily agrees to getting married despite the fact that she is an assassin for a local mob and has no interest in anything except her chosen profession. Since time is of the essence she pretty much has to settle for whoever will have her and in that regard she ends up marrying a man named Kang SuIl SangMyeon Park who at first sight doesn't appear to be much of a catch. However YuJin sees him for the good man that he is and then as a dying request asks EunJin to try to get pregnant. Yet EunJin still has her profession to think of and the last thing she needs is a husband and a child. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that this action film could just as easily be listed as a comedy because there are several hilarious scenes throughout the movie. On that note some of the comedy is a little raunchy but all things considered it wasn't too bad overall. In any case I rate this movie as slightly above average.".

My Wife Is A Gangster is though neither a good comedy nor a good gangster flick. The movie is quite overrated and had two unnecessary sequels.I must admit that the initial idea of the movie sounded promising. There were a couple of very good South Korean movies where a wife had some sort of a double identity and secret life as a special agent for example. Shiri is a great example and My Girlfriend Is An Agent also has its moments. That's why I have watched this movie. But the idea doesn't work very well on here. The two main actors don't have any chemistry. The weird situation of a female gangster married to a shy bourgeois husband could have been funny but the scenes in here are boring the scenario isn't credible and the humour is very childish predictable and superficial.The gangster side of the movie isn't any better. It feels as if it had been inspired by a few serious Yakuza movies by Takashi Miike or Takeshi Kitano and desperately wants to parody the genre. The whole thing doesn't work for two reasons. The actors are annoying mostly bad and not credible at all. A naked gangster running after a punk through half a city isn't funny but more embarrassing than any bad Jackie Chan movie. Second the characters are boring and you simply don't care about them.Then there is the story of the movie. Well what story? The gangster woman fulfills all wishes of her dying sisters and goes through a weird relationship with her husband. Meanwhile her gangster clan beats up a few punks for any reason. When one of her guys gets killed his friend suspects the wrong guy and his revenge fails horribly. When the gangster wife comes to save her gang she loses but her life is spared. She later recovers from her injuries and her husband is ready to avenge her and become a gangster himself. That's it.The viewers have to accept that the stiff husband changed his mind and became a cool bad boy from one instant to the other because he loved his egoistic wife that never showed him any kind of appreciation so much. This rushed and silly story simply doesn't carry a film of almost two hours of running time.Is this scenario credible or original? No. Are there any surprising elements? No. Is there a coherent and gripping story line from the beginning to the end? Not really.Two or three scenes were at least a little bit interesting and slightly funny. That's why I gave three very generous points for this.I recommend you to avoid this movie if you are looking for intelligent humour a few good gangster movie sequences and an original story. If you just feel like switching your brain off and enjoy some childish slapstick humour inspired by stereotypical Hongkong action comedy flicks and generic Japanese gangster films go and waste your time.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie started out great. Eunjin was a awesome character a real gangster. I loved her character she was strong she knew what she was doing and she knew what she was after. She wore sensible shoes and dressed like a gangster! Woot! When her husband tries to rape her twice she totally beats him down and tells him never to touch her without her permission.Then it goes downhill.They did what every Hollywood movie does to a strong female character even though Eunjin is the gangster and the one with the experience it's her husband who 'saves the day' so to speak. He gets revenge for her even though he's slow and stupid. Why oh why can't a movie just let a strong woman be without a man getting even for her? Does it wilt the cocks of the directors and male viewers? Is that it? The 'get married for your dying sister' premise was really weak and not believable. Why not just pay someone to get 'married' to her? Or better yet demand one of her subordinates 'marry' her? He'd be forced to pretend they're happy. Problem solved. It'd make for a far more interesting movie.The guy is a fat ugly rapist manchild. We're supposed to be cheering for him? Why would a smart good looking woman go for a man without who is ugly stupid and has the personality of a spoiled child? For dog's sake it's the 21th century. Hollywood does this trope all the time and I'm disappointed to learn that Korea does as well. If Eunjin was ugly as well it'd make total sense. But Eunjin is conventionally pretty.She finally falls for him because he's just sooooo nice. Barf. The movie tries to make Eunjin seem rough and mean and her husband seem nice. Yeah who's the once getting married and getting knocked up even though it goes against all she is and believes in for the sake of someone she hasn't met in years? That's really nice. Making soup for a cancer patient and going to see your SIL in the hospital isn't as nice as that. He has NOTHING going for him. Oh wait. He has basic courtesy. Mmm. Any man with basic courtesy and manner deserves a hot smart chick! Pander to the ugly male audience! Yeah! The sister only appears to start and validate how good! the husband is.The scene towards the end with Eunjin in the apron made me groan.When Eunjin ends up in the hospital I was okay with it. Better dead than with that ugly idiot manchild rapist. Alas the ending was not so happy.Could you just imagine a movie being made with the roles reversed? HOT SMART GANGSTER MAN Yeah I'm good looking smart and people who work for me respect me. Sure I'm a little rough around the edges but underneath it I'm a good person. I need to get married because of BS circumstances.  UGLY FAT STUPID WOMAN I'm the only one who will ever take you because of your one flaw of being mean! HOT SMART GANGSTER MAN You're right! I should settle for you! UGLY FAT STUPID WOMAN And fall in love with me because I'm so nice! Just ignore those times I tired to put things in your orifices without your permission. And then acted offended when you said no. As your wife I have complete right over your body to do as I please! Who says a rapist can't be a good person? HOT SMART GANGSTER MAN swoon blubber You're so nice. 3 3 3 UGLY FAT STUPID RAPIST WOMAN Yup and wouldn't you know it I evened the score for you while you're in the hospital. I don't know the first thing about being a gangster or killing. But yeah it's so easy that I take out 46 people in one go. And you haven't even killed one of 'em! Must be my awesome lady bits.".

It is a detective thriller with the format of a political expose and deals with an unseen killer whose victims are judges public prosecutors and magistrates. Viewers who have seen Rosi's THREE BROTHERS remember that one of the episodes in that film deals with a magistrate has a nightmare in which he envisions his own murder my terrorists. In ILLUSTRIOUS CORPSES Rosi elevates the crime of assassination to a cataclysmic dimension within which a modern industrial society is dragged to the brink of collapse. It is a structurally elliptical but harrowing picture of the weaknesses in social foundations and the fragility of all government. The country the movie is set in is unspecified although it clearly seems to be Italy. Yet the film is unspecific enough to represent any nation portrayed as being on the brink of anarchy. The eerie opening is set in Palermo's Convento dei Cappuccini with its crypt of 8000 bodies some mummified some rotting in subterranean corridors. Rosi turns those images into a horrific metaphor of political and social transience that are the themes of this movie. In the final sequence oceans of bannerwaving Communists are cut with noisily revving tanks being readied for a rightist takeover of power. One should observe that Rosi's leftwing political biases admit only of rightwing coups as being ominous. Nevertheless it is an unsettling finale to a remarkable and unsettling film.".

	schema:headline " Paranoid Italian Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Francesco Rosi's Cadaveri Eccellenti is a noble addition to the body of superlative thrillers that the 1970s produced. Based on a novel by Leonardo Sciascia it is however a bit unusual. Closer to the paranoid thriller The Parallax View than exposs like All The President's Men and The Three Days of the Condor it's more of a meditation on power and the lies governments create to maintain their power. A district attorney is murdered followed by several judges. Inspector Rogas Lino Ventura is assigned to helm the investigation because he's the best man in the force. But the political contours of the murders test his freedom to investigate. His meticulous method clashes with his superiors' wishes for a swift solution when he starts investigating the private lives of the dead men throwing doubts at their muchtouted incorruptibility. His own convictions become a liability when he's forced to work with the political police on the assumption that revolutionary groups are behind the murders. Slowly Rogas uncovers what he thinks is a conspiracy but benefiting who is another matter.The movie entertaining as it is deviates in critical aspects from the superior novel. Important scenes are shortened or omitted and new ones are added for no good reason. Rosi's communism also shines through the movie. Although Sciascia had leftwing sympathies he was wise enough to recognize that when it comes to craving power there's no difference between left and right. For that reason his novel was very critical of everyone. Rosi portrays the communists in a more positive turning the writer and journalist Causan Luigi Pistilli into a heroic truthseeking man when in the novel he was a coward terrified of being involved by Rogas in his dangerous conspiracy. The movie also makes the connection between the killer of judges and the government almost undeniable whereas the novel never made it clear.Lino Ventura is nearly perfect in the movie he plays the introspective Rogas almost as I imagined him calm reserved compassionate and with a fragile side the mere act of putting on glasses to read something says so much about his character. He reminds me of Morgan Freeman in Seven.Other characters walk through the movie doing a good job Pistilli doesn't play the Cusan I expected but he always adds color to any scene. Renato Salvatori and Fernando del Rey play small roles too. Max Von Sydow was miscast in my opinion as the president of the Supreme Court he looked too young for such a responsible position and sadly his dialog with Rogas so powerful in the novel was greatly truncated minus my favorite line judicial errors do not exist when Rogas exposes the theory that a wrongly accused man is killing judges.Cadaveri Eccellenti is a fine movie much more interesting and suspenseful than I remember when I watched it back in 2005. Its combination of talents shouldn't leave any film lover unmoved the legendary Tonino Guerra on the script and Pasqualino De Santis Death in Venice The Damned A Special Day in charge of the cinematography alone guarantee that this movie is worth watching. When you add the imagination of Leonardo Sciascia and a strong performance by Lino Ventura playing his way through beautiful Italian landscapes you have a winner.".

The movie also makes the connection between the killer of judges and the government almost undeniable whereas the novel never made it clear.Lino Ventura is nearly perfect in the movie he plays the introspective Rogas almost as I imagined him calm reserved compassionate and with a fragile side the mere act of putting on glasses to read something says so much about his character. He reminds me of Morgan Freeman in Seven.Other characters walk through the movie doing a good job Pistilli doesn't play the Cusan I expected but he always adds color to any scene. Renato Salvatori and Fernando del Rey play small roles too. Max Von Sydow was miscast in my opinion as the president of the Supreme Court he looked too young for such a responsible position and sadly his dialog with Rogas so powerful in the novel was greatly truncated minus my favorite line judicial errors do not exist when Rogas exposes the theory that a wrongly accused man is killing judges.Cadaveri Eccellenti is a fine movie much more interesting and suspenseful than I remember when I watched it back in 2005. Its combination of talents shouldn't leave any film lover unmoved the legendary Tonino Guerra on the script and Pasqualino De Santis Death in Venice The Damned A Special Day in charge of the cinematography alone guarantee that this movie is worth watching. When you add the imagination of Leonardo Sciascia and a strong performance by Lino Ventura playing his way through beautiful Italian landscapes you have a winner.";

Second my own two cents since I've just read the negative comments on the discussion boards where people are actually wondering if this is the worst movie ever. No way! OK my own approach to it was an uphill journey. First saw it ages ago because Tre fratelli and Cristo si  fermato a Eboli had impressed me. This one is quite different and I didn't get a thing. Years later I stumbled over the story it's based on The Context. A parody by Leonardo Sciascia. Even readers only passingly familiar with Sciascia will realize that the baddies are never caught in his books reflecting the realities of his native Sicily. Of all the books of his I've read this one was the toughest because evil is omnipresent and not identified with individuals. A parody perhaps but a bitter one and one he took a long time to finish because writing it distressed him. Rosi read it on a long journey and it hit him like lightning. Like Sciascia he was interested in the ways power corrupts people. So that's what we have here a relentless gallery of corrupt officials in every walk of life. Not only in the Mafia but also in the realms of politics justice the military and religion. Max von Sydow's character is as repellent as anything I've ever seen. The whole caboodle is not meant to be fully understood and that's where a large part of that allpervading sense of menace comes from. The locations are gorgeous  wish I knew where that bus stop was where Rogas watches the procession of highandmighties drive by. And those catacombs! Someone here said the location wasn't clearly identified but given that both Sciascia and Rosi were Italian and that the film features a map of Sicily rather prominently in one shot I beg to differ. IMHO this is indeed Sicily. And bella Italia. Berlusconi may look more benign than certain of his predecessors but... oh all right all right this ain't the Speaker's Corner. The rest is silence.".

That became one of my favourite opera films after seeing it for the first time at a relatively young age getting into opera and still is it's actually even better now with the few things that didn't quite do it for me on my very first viewing like the opening not being issues.Enough of talking about that film and lets talk about his 'Cadaveri Excellenti' 'Illustrious Corpses'. Was expecting great things after hearing a lot of positive things about it and was not let down it deserves every good thing that has been said about it and deserves to be better known and accessibly. Am a subjective person but that 'Illustrious Corpses' was not available on DVD for a while and is to this day still underseen is inexplicable when films nowhere near as good and in some cases not good films not only have wider coverage and highly marketed but are shown on television far more and are popular on DVD.Talking now about 'Illustrious Corpses' as a film it looks wonderful with some of the most strikingly beautiful and atmospherefilled cinematography of any Italian film that doesn't have Federico Fellini's name on it. Some of it makes for many beautiful and at times nightmarish imagery the mummified bodies will give one the creeps. The locations are also cleverly used and have both exquisite allure and stark atmosphere apologies for throwing around this word a lot it is hard not to when it is to me a crucial element of a film and should be mentioned. The music is haunting and has presence whether understated or more bold without being too loud.'Illustrious Corpses' is intelligently written and thoughtprovoking thematically it is bold and brutally honest yet human. Its depiction of Italian politics may not be innovative as such but was and still is honest and really quite daring in a way that nobody expects for back then. The story is deliberate in pace yet to me was transfixing with a slow burning tension to the thrillermystery parts sustained brilliantly with nothing being what it seems and .The opening sequence is one of the best beginnings of any film seen recently and perhaps ever not just in how incredibly shot but also the emotion and chills one feels watching it. Even more striking is the shocking and really quite powerful ending that ends not in a way one expects some may not like it but for me that it didn't end conveniently predictably or less downbeat was actually appreciated and it did not jar tonally like those potentially would. There is suspense and there is nothing given away too early one is kept guessing throughout with not much to help us. The killings are unlenting and the characters compellingly real with a lead character written with such honesty that it makes the outcome even sadder.Rosi directs exceptionally with impeccable style and sense of mood and gets the best out of his cast. Lino Ventura is in the lead role and smoulders unforgettably on screen giving a performance of magisterial and brooding intensity. It is a performance that has garnered comparisons as being the Italian Robert Mitchum or Humphrey Bogart and one can see why. The other standout is Max Von Sydow an actor so consistently great that it would have been very hard to get a bad performance out of him. A bad performance this is nowhere near close to being instead it is repellent unrepentance at its most chilling yet nuanced it is a masterclass of saying a lot without always saying much or anything and Von Sydow always was a master at this.Concluding superb film and deserves far more credit. 1010 Bethany Cox".

The other standout is Max Von Sydow an actor so consistently great that it would have been very hard to get a bad performance out of him. A bad performance this is nowhere near close to being instead it is repellent unrepentance at its most chilling yet nuanced it is a masterclass of saying a lot without always saying much or anything and Von Sydow always was a master at this.Concluding superb film and deserves far more credit. 1010 Bethany Cox";

What we have here is a nice thick Spezzatino full of meat plot vegetables twists and herbs cameo appearances by various Italian genre actors all mainly revolving around middleaged policeman Rogas. The general tone of the film is set when we see an elderly judge wandering through the Catacombe dei Cappuccini looking at the corpses and perhaps considering his own mortality. That would be ironic because about a minute after he leaves someone unknown assassin shoots him. This brings us to Rogas Italy's best detective brought in because killing judges isn't generally approved. At first Rogas brings in the local mob but as one Don states You know you are wasting your time with us. While he's doing that another judge is killed on a highway and yet another while Rogas is in the same building. This piles significant pressure on Rogas as the situation becomes as one person puts it 'political'.Rogas reckons he's nailed the case when he starts digging into trials involving all three judges which leads to him finding a suspect for whom every image has been destroyed including photo albums and even police documentation. This leads the film into giallo territory for a brief time as we see another judge get stalked and murdered while Rogas is pushed to look at subversive groups and bag a quick arrest by his superiors.This two hour long film that has very little action should be snoozefest but it is relentlessly fascinating to watch Rogas weave his way through the political labyrinth of Italy's Years of Lead speaking with bemused yet sinister Senators like Fernando Rey great here angry unrepentent judges like Max Von Sydow also great and the Communist party including journalist Luigi Pistilli. You also get cameos from Marcel Bozuffi and Tina Aumont thrown in for good measure.What also keeps you watching is the ever growing sense of doom and paranoia that begins to surround Rogas as he loses confidence and trust in every single person he deals with leaving him constantly looking over his shoulder. There's a scene where he realises his telephone is bugged that's as foreboding as any horror film. I highly recommend this one  it's dark and complex. Like a Spezzatino.".
